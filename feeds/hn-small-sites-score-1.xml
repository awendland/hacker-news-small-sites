ADHD is a chronic neuro disorder and usually remains in adulthood. Those patients usually have problems to pay attention, hyperactivity and impulsive behavior, which causes issues especially during childhood and adolescence during the learning process. Those issues frequently lead to problems in school, which can impact their education if they are not assisted by specialists.&nbsp;</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span>Usually the treatment for those patients includes medications or behavioral interventions. However, a new approach has been developing, in which technology is involved. Scientists have discovered that video games can benefit kids who suffer with ADHD. In the last century video games were usually massively for entertainment purposes. Giant companies from game industries such as Nintendo and Sega have started the introduction of playing video games in the population. Those enjoyable visual contents were part of the childhood of many people worldwide. However, what people would not know is that in the future, <a href="https://www.brainlatam.com/blog/graphogame-jogo-de-alfabetizacao-para-criancas-chega-ao-brasil-2341" target="_blank">video games</a> could be used for other purposes rather than entertainment.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span>With the advance of computers and also computer graphic technology were the main responsible for the development of free softwares to the public who are interested in creating independent video games. Thus, different content and purpose of video games have been created, especially those related to serious games, which are dedicated for treatment.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span>In this regard, a team of researchers from the Institute of Sport Science at the University of Bern have discovered that physical exertion games (exergaming) can improve executive function in kids with ADHD. Executive functions are cognitive functions related to memory, logical reasoning, solving problems, task planning and execution. The research has counted 51 children diagnosed with ADHD between 8 to 12 years old. They have separated into an exergaming group and control group.&nbsp;</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span>The exergaming group have played a video game called Shape up while the control group have watched a documentary about mountain running. What scientists have found is that the exergaming group has a higher score in a test called Flanker test, in which measures the ability to ignore irrelevant information. Thus, the results show that physical exercise can impact and enhance cognition in children with ADHD. Also, exergaming might contribute for that.&nbsp;</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span>Immersive worlds and video games have become a powerful tool in the health care system. The industry of video games which is bigger than the cinematographic, has increased exponentially, and the application of video games for treatment of neurological disorders and neurorehabilitation can enhance human quality of life. Combining those technologies with neuroimages techniques such as <a href="https://www.brainlatam.com/products/eeg" target="_blank">EEG</a> and <a href="https://www.brainlatam.com/manufacturers/nirx" target="_blank">NIRs</a> can enhance the perspectives of researches related to gaming,&nbsp; immersive worlds and human behavior, making it more accurate by measuring the brain rhythms while performing a task.&nbsp;</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span>Reference:</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span>[1] </span><span>Valentin Benzing, Yu-Kai Chang &amp; Mirko Schmidt. </span><span>Acute Physical Activity Enhances Executive Functions in Children with ADHD. </span><span>Scientific Reports, 2018.</span></p></div></div><p>The content published here is the exclusive responsibility of the authors.</p></div>]]>

<p>The software has poured into almost all areas of our lives throughout the
years. It remembers phone numbers of our loved ones, it finds the best route to
a well-reviewed restaurant we want to eat in, and many many more things. This
ever-presence of software engineering in our day-to-day things brings all
kinds of questions on what is ethical and what is not.</p>
<p>The topic of ethics is significant for us programmers (developers) who
produce living and breathing pieces of code every day. Those pieces of code can
change and affect other people’s lives. So, is being ethical in your work worth
it? And what to do when presented with questionable requirements from your
superiors?</p>
<p>These are all hard questions and topics, but let’s try to break them together.</p>
<h2 id="to-bully-or-to-be-bullied"><a href="#to-bully-or-to-be-bullied" aria-label="to bully or to be bullied permalink"></a>To Bully, or To Be Bullied</h2>
<p>I recently came about a tweet where a company was being called out for planning
to build features that would do surveillance on their users. Here’s the <a href="https://twitter.com/dhh/status/1336266946044686337">tweet</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">The surveillance regime marches on. This is Clockify promising a road map of ever-more oppressive and dehumanizing tracking of employees. If we're just being HONEST here, I'd like to see this blown into a million bits. Source code encrypted and the key lost. Just awful. <a href="https://t.co/OfnjKn6dDp">https://t.co/OfnjKn6dDp</a></p>— DHH (@dhh) <a href="https://twitter.com/dhh/status/1336266946044686337?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 8, 2020</a></blockquote> 
<p>A company named Clockify, which provides time-tracking features to their users,
exposed a road-map where they will do screenshots and GPS tracking of their
users. Of course, somebody took the picture in the tweet out of context. The
idea was to provide these features to only some portion of their users who
would pay for them. I am not saying it to justify the features they
are adding, just trying to put more context into the conversation.</p>
<p>Of course, the idea of watching over someone while they work is appalling to me,
and I would never work or run a company that does this. What’s more
intriguing to me is the dilemma of what do you do when you work for such a company. We will
always have some persona on social media that will bash the shit out
of ideas like user surveillance, but what can a ground-level developer like
you and me do in this situation?</p>
<p><span>

<p>Let’s say you work in that company, and someone asked you to build a feature that
tracks what users do on their computers. Would you stand up and say a hard ‘no’
to the management? Or, would you nod your head and leave a 👍 reaction.
Answering this question is hard. But to make it a bit easier, I would like to
remind you that even as an engineer, you can be held accountable, even though
you are not the ‘mastermind’ behind all of it.</p>
<p>I’m not trying to scare you or anything, but did you know that Volkswagen’s
engineer got sentenced to more than three years in prison for being involved in a
scheme that allowed VW to sell diesel cars that generated more pollution than
it was allowed? You can read all about it <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-volkswagen-emissions-sentencing/vw-engineer-sentenced-to-40-month-prison-term-in-diesel-case-idUSKCN1B51YP">here</a>.
You decide if it was worth it for that guy.</p>
<h2 id="taking-the-oath"><a href="#taking-the-oath" aria-label="taking the oath permalink"></a>Taking the oath</h2>
<p>No matter what job you do as a developer. You had to start somewhere. Some
folks took the university route. Some did the online courses at
home and honed their craft. But no matter what you did, rarely anyone had a
class or a course to them a thing or two about ethics.</p>
<p>In other professions, such as have their documents with core values and
standards. The most famous one is, of course, the Hippocratic oath medical
doctors need to take. Doctors promise to care responsibly for their patients
and learn ethics as part of their education. It is crucial for doctor’s
patients to feel confident that the doctor has their best interest at heart.</p>
<p>We should have something similar in our line of work but applied
more often. There are a couple of examples where people put together documents
that describe what ethics for software engineers is. For example, the world’s
largest educational and scientific computing society - ACM - has a
<a href="https://www.acm.org/code-of-ethics">Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct</a>.
Check it out, it is an interesting read.</p>
<p>I am not saying that enforcing all computing professionals to take some oath
will drop the surveillance or other unethical software to drop to
zero. People will try to go out of the way whatever we do. What we need to do
instead is to teach about ethics in computer science <strong>more</strong> since our actions
can impact the world more than ever.</p>
<h2 id="field-studies"><a href="#field-studies" aria-label="field studies permalink"></a>Field studies</h2>
<p>An interesting thing I found is that StackOverflow asked a couple of questions
about ethics in 2018 (now two years ago). It turns out that most of the developers
(58.5% to be precise) back then said that they would refuse to write code for
an unethical purpose. Also, a huge portion (almost 80%) said that developers have an
obligation to consider the ethical implications of their code, which is relieving.</p>
<p>Alongside these numbers of ethics awareness, there were a lot of ethical grays.
Devs are not entirely sure who would they report ethical problems. Furthermore,
developers think differently about who is ultimately responsible
for the unethical code. Right there, in those two spots, I see a lot of room for
improvement. There is potential to educate companies and teams and have go-to
persons to report unethical claims in establishments.</p>
<p>I wonder how the survey would perform if the same questions get asked this year. If
you’re interested in the survey, you can check it out
<a href="https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2018/#ethics">on StackOverflow here</a>.</p>
<h2 id="so-is-it-worth-it"><a href="#so-is-it-worth-it" aria-label="so is it worth it permalink"></a>So, is it worth it?</h2>
<p>Well, it depends on who you ask. If you are a person responsible for a company’s income,
your best interest is to see trends on charts go in the upwards
direction. How you do it, it might now be the most ethical way, but you are
still crushing it. Or are you?</p>
<p><span>
      <span></span>
  <img alt="Random chart" title="Random chart" src="https://pragmaticpineapple.com/static/eea6a884861dac2a0650ddcec764face/fcda8/random-chart.png" srcset="https://pragmaticpineapple.com/static/eea6a884861dac2a0650ddcec764face/12f09/random-chart.png 148w,

    </span></p>
<p>I am going back to the example of the Clockify (or Hubstaff, or any other time-tracking)
product. The new features that go over the ethics will probably be the most
expensive ones, and could provide more profit for the company. Is that a good
thing? Not always, I believe. If you’re chasing to increase those fancy
acronyms (ARR and MRR) and do not care about the ethics (and the world) - then
I think it is not a good thing.</p>
<p>Yes, the income will come quicker, but the broader impact on the world can be
detrimental. Imagine if all the time-tracking companies will slowly move to
this approach and that surveillance will become the norm in these apps.</p>
<p>So, in the end, no, I <strong>do think being ethical in your work is worth it</strong>. Maybe
not in a quantifiable way or in a way where you can plot a chart and show it to
your manager. Definitely, the actions you decide to take or not to take can
impact those around you. I feel that the fact that we can influence other
people’s lives is something we, as programmers, often overlook. And we shouldn’t
do that, because what’s most important to remember is that we are all in this
together.</p>
<h2 id="action-points"><a href="#action-points" aria-label="action points permalink"></a>Action points</h2>
<p>Where to go now? I recommend reading or going through a couple of resources here:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_ethics">Programming ethics on Wikipedia</a> - provides a good summary</li>
<li><a href="https://www.acm.org/code-of-ethics">ACM Code of Ethics</a> - in-depth example of an ethics code</li>
<li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10284614-the-clean-coder">The Clean Coder: A Code of Conduct for Professional Programmers</a> - great book overall</li>
<li><a href="https://simpleprogrammer.com/ethical-programming-professional/">What It Takes To Be an Ethical Programming Professional</a> - an insightful blog post</li>
<li>If going through an online course is your thing, maybe try one of those</li>
</ul>
<p>Remember, being ethical won’t be easy, and it won’t look great at times. The
most critical takeaway from this post is to spend time to set up your ethical
boundaries. From then on, it is easier to have conversations and ask questions
like - “is this in the best interest of our users?” and “how does this affect
our organization’s reputation?“.</p>
<p>I hope this post brought some insight or, at least, reminded you that something
like ethics still exists in our profession. If you like topics like these,

<p>Bash scripts. Almost anyone needs to write one sooner or later. Almost no one says “yeah, I love writing them”. And that’s why almost everyone is putting low attention while writing them.</p>



<p>I won’t try to make you a Bash expert (since I’m not a one either), but I will show you a minimal template that will make your scripts safer. You don’t need to thank me, your future self will thank you.</p>



<h2><span id="why_scripting_in_bash"></span>Why scripting in Bash?<span></span></h2>



<p>The best summary of Bash scripting appeared recently on my Twitter feed:</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>The opposite of "it's like riding a bike" is "it's like programming in bash".</p><p>A phrase which means that no matter how many times you do something, you will have to re-learn it every single time.</p></div>— Jake Wharton (@JakeWharton) <a href="https://twitter.com/JakeWharton/status/1334177665356587008?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 2, 2020</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>But Bash has something in common with another widely beloved language. Just like JavaScript, it won’t go away easily. While we can hope that Bash won’t become the main language for literally everything, it’s always somewhere near.</p>



<p>Bash <a href="https://www.quora.com/Is-Bash-considered-the-lingua-franca-of-shells/answer/Paul-Reiber">inherited the shell throne</a> and can be found on almost every Linux, including Docker images. And this is the environment in which most of the backend runs. So if you need to script the server application startup, a CI/CD step, or integration test run, Bash is there for you.</p>



<p>To glue few commands together, pass output from one to another, and just start some executable, Bash is the easiest and most native solution. While it makes perfect sense to write bigger, more complicated scripts in other languages, you can’t expect to have Python, Ruby, fish, or whatever another interpreter you believe is the best, available everywhere. And you probably should think twice and then once more before adding it to some prod server, Docker image, or CI environment.</p>



<p>Yet Bash is far from perfect. The syntax is a nightmare. Error handling is difficult. There are landmines everywhere. And we have to deal with it.</p>



<h2><span id="bash_script_template"></span>Bash script template<span></span></h2>



<p>Without further ado, here it is.</p>



<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/env bash

set -Eeuo pipefail
trap cleanup SIGINT SIGTERM ERR EXIT

script_dir=$(cd "$(dirname "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}")" &amp;&gt;/dev/null &amp;&amp; pwd -P)

usage() {
  cat &lt;&lt;EOF
Usage: $(basename "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}") [-h] [-v] [-f] -p param_value arg1 [arg2...]

Script description here.

Available options:

-h, --help      Print this help and exit
-v, --verbose   Print script debug info
-f, --flag      Some flag description
-p, --param     Some param description
EOF
  exit
}

cleanup() {
  trap - SIGINT SIGTERM ERR EXIT
  # script cleanup here
}

setup_colors() {
  if [[ -t 2 ]] &amp;&amp; [[ -z "${NO_COLOR-}" ]] &amp;&amp; [[ "${TERM-}" != "dumb" ]]; then
    NOFORMAT='\033[0m' RED='\033[0;31m' GREEN='\033[0;32m' ORANGE='\033[0;33m' BLUE='\033[0;34m' PURPLE='\033[0;35m' CYAN='\033[0;36m' YELLOW='\033[1;33m'
  else
    NOFORMAT='' RED='' GREEN='' ORANGE='' BLUE='' PURPLE='' CYAN='' YELLOW=''
  fi
}

msg() {
  echo &gt;&amp;2 -e "${1-}"
}

die() {
  local msg=$1
  local code=${2-1} # default exit status 1
  msg "$msg"
  exit "$code"
}

parse_params() {
  # default values of variables set from params
  flag=0
  param=''

  while :; do
    case "${1-}" in
    -h | --help) usage ;;
    -v | --verbose) set -x ;;
    --no-color) NO_COLOR=1 ;;
    -f | --flag) flag=1 ;; # example flag
    -p | --param) # example named parameter
      param="${2-}"
      shift
      ;;
    -?*) die "Unknown option: $1" ;;
    *) break ;;
    esac
    shift
  done

  args=("$@")

  # check required params and arguments
  [[ -z "${param-}" ]] &amp;&amp; die "Missing required parameter: param"
  [[ ${#args[@]} -eq 0 ]] &amp;&amp; die "Missing script arguments"

  return 0
}

parse_params "$@"
setup_colors

# script logic here

msg "${RED}Read parameters:${NOFORMAT}"
msg "- flag: ${flag}"
msg "- param: ${param}"
msg "- arguments: ${args[*]-}"</code></pre>



<p>The idea was to not make it too long. I don’t want to scroll 500 lines to the script logic. At the same time, I want some strong foundations for any script. But Bash is not making this easy, lacking any form of dependencies management.</p>



<p>One solution would be to have a separate script with all the boilerplate and utility functions and execute it at the beginning. The downside would be to have to always attach this second file everywhere, losing the “simple Bash script” idea along the way. So I decided to put in the template only what I consider to be a minimum to keep it possible short.</p>



<p>Now let’s look at it in more detail.</p>



<h3><span id="choose_bash"></span>Choose Bash<span></span></h3>



<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/env bash</code></pre>



<p>Script traditionally starts with a shebang. For the <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/21612980/why-is-usr-bin-env-bash-superior-to-bin-bash">best compatibility</a>, it references <code>/usr/bin/env</code>, not the <code>/bin/bash</code> directly. Although, if you read comments in the linked StackOverflow question, even this can fail sometimes.</p>



<h3><span id="fail_fast"></span>Fail fast<span></span></h3>



<pre><code>set -Eeuo pipefail</code></pre>



<p>The <code>set</code> command changes script execution options. For example, <strong>normally Bash does not care if some command failed</strong>, returning a non-zero exit status code. It just happily jumps to the next one. Now consider this little script:</p>



<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/env bash
cp important_file ./backups/
rm important_file</code></pre>



<p>What will happen, if the <code>backups</code> directory does not exist? Exactly, you will get an error message in the console, but before you will be able to react, the file will be already removed by the second command.</p>



<p>For details on what options exactly <code>set -Eeuo pipefail</code> changes and how they will protect you, I refer you to the <a href="https://vaneyckt.io/posts/safer_bash_scripts_with_set_euxo_pipefail/">article I have in my bookmarks for a few years now</a>.</p>



<p>Although you should know that there are some <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/commandline/comments/g1vsxk/the_first_two_statements_of_your_bash_script/fniifmk?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3">arguments against setting those options</a>.</p>



<h3><span id="get_the_location"></span>Get the location<span></span></h3>



<pre><code>script_dir=$(cd "$(dirname "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}")" &amp;&gt;/dev/null &amp;&amp; pwd -P)</code></pre>



<p>This line <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/246128/2512304">does its best</a> to define the script’s location directory<s>, and then we <code>cd</code> to it. Why?</s></p>



<p>Often our scripts are operating on paths relative to the script location, copying files and executing commands, assuming the script directory is also a working directory. And it is, as long as we execute the script from its directory.</p>



<p>But if, let’s say, our CI config executes script like this:</p>



<pre><code>/opt/ci/project/script.sh</code></pre>



<p>then our script is operating not in project dir, but some completely different workdir of our CI tool. We can fix it, by going to the directory before executing the script:</p>



<pre><code>cd /opt/ci/project &amp;&amp; ./script.sh</code></pre>



<p>But it’s much nicer to solve this on the script side. So, if the script reads some file or executes another program from the same directory, call it like this:</p>



<pre><code>cat "$script_dir/my_file"</code></pre>



<p>At the same time, the script does not change the workdir location. If the script is executed from some other directory and the user provides a relative path to some file, we will still be able to read it.</p>



<h3><span id="try_to_clean_up"></span>Try to clean up<span></span></h3>



<pre><code>trap cleanup SIGINT SIGTERM ERR EXIT

cleanup() {
  trap - SIGINT SIGTERM ERR EXIT
  # script cleanup here
}</code></pre>



<p>Think about the <code>trap</code> like of a <code>finally</code> block for the script. At the end of the script – normal, caused by an error or an external signal – the <code>cleanup()</code> function will be executed. This is a place where you can, for example, try to remove all temporary files created by the script.</p>



<p>Just remember that the <code>cleanup()</code> can be called not only at the end but as well having the script done any part of the work. Not necessarily all the resources you try to cleanup will exist.</p>



<h3><span id="display_helpful_help"></span>Display helpful help<span></span></h3>



<pre><code>usage() {
  cat &lt;&lt;EOF
Usage: $(basename "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}") [-h] [-v] [-f] -p param_value arg1 [arg2...]

Script description here.

...
EOF
  exit
}</code></pre>



<p>Having the <code>usage()</code> relatively close to the top of the script, it will act in two ways:</p>



<ul><li>to <strong>display help</strong> for someone who does not know all the options and does not want to go over the whole script to discover them,</li><li>as a <strong>minimal documentation</strong> when someone modifies the script (for example you, 2 weeks later, not even remembering writing it in the first place).</li></ul>



<p>I don’t argue to document every function here. But a short, nice script usage message is a required minimum.</p>



<h3><span id="print_nice_messages"></span>Print nice messages<span></span></h3>



<pre><code>setup_colors() {
  if [[ -t 2 ]] &amp;&amp; [[ -z "${NO_COLOR-}" ]] &amp;&amp; [[ "${TERM-}" != "dumb" ]]; then
    NOFORMAT='\033[0m' RED='\033[0;31m' GREEN='\033[0;32m' ORANGE='\033[0;33m' BLUE='\033[0;34m' PURPLE='\033[0;35m' CYAN='\033[0;36m' YELLOW='\033[1;33m'
  else
    NOFORMAT='' RED='' GREEN='' ORANGE='' BLUE='' PURPLE='' CYAN='' YELLOW=''
  fi
}

msg() {
  echo &gt;&amp;2 -e "${1-}"
}</code></pre>



<p>Firstly, remove the <code>setup_colors()</code> function if you don’t want to use colors in text anyway. I keep it because I know I would use colors more often if I wouldn’t have to google codes for them every time.</p>



<p>Secondly, those <strong>colors are meant to be used with the <code>msg()</code> function only</strong>, not with the <code>echo</code> command.</p>



<p>The <strong><code>msg()</code> function is meant to be used to print everything that is not a script output</strong>. This includes all logs and messages, not only the errors. Citing the great <a href="https://medium.com/@jdxcode/12-factor-cli-apps-dd3c227a0e46">12 Factor CLI Apps</a> article:</p>



<blockquote><p><strong>In short: stdout is for output, stderr is for messaging.</strong></p><cite><a href="https://jdxcode.com/">Jeff Dickey</a>, who <a href="https://github.com/oclif/oclif/graphs/contributors">knows a little</a> about <a href="https://github.com/heroku/cli/graphs/contributors">building CLI apps</a></cite></blockquote>



<p>That’s why in most cases you shouldn’t use colors for <code>stdout</code> anyway.</p>



<p>Messages printed with <code>msg()</code> are sent to <code>stderr</code> stream and support special sequences, like colors. And colors are disabled anyway if the <code>stderr</code> output is not an interactive terminal or&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://no-color.org/" rel="noreferrer noopener">one of the standard parameters</a>&nbsp;is passed.</p>



<p>Usage:</p>



<pre><code>msg "This is a ${RED}very important${NOFORMAT} message, but not a script output value!"</code></pre>



<p>To check how it behaves when the <code>stderr</code> is not an interactive terminal, add a line like above to the script. Then execute it redirecting <code>stderr</code> to <code>stdout</code> and piping it to <code>cat</code>. Pipe operation makes the output no longer being sent directly to the terminal, but to the next command, so the colors should be disabled now.</p>



<pre><code>$ ./test.sh 2&gt;&amp;1 | cat
This is a very important message, but not a script output value!</code></pre>



<h3><span id="parse_any_parameters"></span>Parse any parameters<span></span></h3>



<pre><code>parse_params() {
  # default values of variables set from params
  flag=0
  param=''

  while :; do
    case "${1-}" in
    -h | --help) usage ;;
    -v | --verbose) set -x ;;
    --no-color) NO_COLOR=1 ;;
    -f | --flag) flag=1 ;; # example flag
    -p | --param) # …</code></pre></div></div>

<p><a href="https://mypy-lang.org/" rel="noopener">Mypy</a> is an optional static type checker for Python. It's been around since 2012 and is gaining traction even since. One of the main benefits of using a type checker is getting errors at "compile time" rather than at run time.</p>
<p>Exhaustiveness checking is a common feature of type checkers, and a very useful one! In this article I'm going to show you <strong>how you can get mypy to perform exhaustiveness checking!</strong></p>

<h2 id="exhaustiveness-checking"><a href="#exhaustiveness-checking">Exhaustiveness Checking</a></h2>
<p>Say you have a system to manage orders. To represent the status of an order, you have the following enum:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>import</span> <span>enum</span>

<span>class</span> <span>OrderStatus</span><span>(</span><span>enum</span><span>.</span><span>Enum</span><span>):</span>
    <span>Ready</span> <span>=</span> <span>'ready'</span>
    <span>Shipped</span> <span>=</span> <span>'shipped'</span>
</pre></div>


<p>You also have the following code to process an <code>Order</code>:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>def</span> <span>handle_order</span><span>(</span><span>status</span><span>:</span> <span>OrderStatus</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>None</span><span>:</span>
    <span>if</span> <span>status</span> <span>is</span> <span>OrderStatus</span><span>.</span><span>Ready</span><span>:</span>
        <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>'ship order'</span><span>)</span>

    <span>elif</span> <span>status</span> <span>is</span> <span>OrderStatus</span><span>.</span><span>Shipped</span><span>:</span>
        <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>'charge order'</span><span>)</span>
</pre></div>


<p>When the order is ready, you ship it; and when it's shipped, you charge it.</p>
<p>A few months go by and your system becomes big. So big in fact, that you can no longer ship orders immediately, and you add a new status:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>import</span> <span>enum</span>

<span>class</span> <span>OrderStatus</span><span>(</span><span>enum</span><span>.</span><span>Enum</span><span>):</span>
    <span>Ready</span> <span>=</span> <span>'ready'</span>
<span>    <span>Scheduled</span> <span>=</span> <span>'scheduled'</span>
</span>    <span>Shipped</span> <span>=</span> <span>'shipped'</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Before you push this change to production, you run a quick check with mypy to make sure everything is OK:</p>
<div><pre><span></span>$ mypy main.py
Success: no issues found in <span>1</span> <span>source</span> file
</pre></div>


<p>Mypy does not see anything wrong in this code, Do you? The problem is that <strong>you forgot to handle the new status in your function</strong>.</p>
<p>One way to make sure you always handle all possible order statuses is to add an assert, or throw an exception:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>def</span> <span>handle_order</span><span>(</span><span>status</span><span>:</span> <span>OrderStatus</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>None</span><span>:</span>
    <span>if</span> <span>status</span> <span>is</span> <span>OrderStatus</span><span>.</span><span>Ready</span><span>:</span>
        <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>'ship order'</span><span>)</span>

    <span>elif</span> <span>status</span> <span>is</span> <span>OrderStatus</span><span>.</span><span>Shipped</span><span>:</span>
        <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>'charge order'</span><span>)</span>

<span>    <span>assert</span> <span>False</span><span>,</span> <span>f</span><span>'Unhandled status "{status}"'</span>
</span></pre></div>


<p>Now, when you execute the function with the new status <code>OrderStatus.Scheduled</code>, you will get a runtime error:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span>handle_order</span><span>(</span><span>OrderStatus</span><span>.</span><span>Scheduled</span><span>)</span>
<span>AssertionError</span><span>:</span> <span>Unhandled</span> <span>status</span> <span>"OrderStatus.Scheduled"</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Another way to with deal with cases like this is to go over your test suite and add scenarios in all the places that use order status. But... if you forgot to change the function when you added the status, what are the chances you'll remember to update the tests? That's not a good solution...</p>
<p><strong>Exhaustiveness Checking in Mypy</strong></p>
<p>What if mypy could warn you at "compile time" about such cases? Well... it can, using this little magic function:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>from</span> <span>typing</span> <span>import</span> <span>NoReturn</span>
<span>import</span> <span>enum</span>

<span>def</span> <span>assert_never</span><span>(</span><span>value</span><span>:</span> <span>NoReturn</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>NoReturn</span><span>:</span>
    <span>assert</span> <span>False</span><span>,</span> <span>f</span><span>'Unhandled value: {value} ({type(value).__name__})'</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Before you dig into the implementation, try to use it to see how it works. In the function above, place <code>assert_never</code> after you handled all the possible order statuses, where you previously used <code>assert</code> or raises an exception:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>def</span> <span>handle_order</span><span>(</span><span>status</span><span>:</span> <span>OrderStatus</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>None</span><span>:</span>
    <span>if</span> <span>status</span> <span>is</span> <span>OrderStatus</span><span>.</span><span>Ready</span><span>:</span>
        <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>'ship order'</span><span>)</span>

    <span>elif</span> <span>status</span> <span>is</span> <span>OrderStatus</span><span>.</span><span>Shipped</span><span>:</span>
        <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>'charge order'</span><span>)</span>

<span>    <span>else</span><span>:</span>
</span><span>        <span>assert_never</span><span>(</span><span>status</span><span>)</span>
</span></pre></div>


<p>Now, check the code with Mypy:</p>
<div><pre><span></span>$ mypy main.py
error: Argument <span>1</span> to <span>"assert_never"</span> has incompatible <span>type</span> <span>"Literal[OrderStatus.Scheduled]"</span><span>;</span>
expected <span>"NoReturn"</span>
Found <span>1</span> error in <span>1</span> file <span>(</span>checked <span>1</span> <span>source</span> file<span>)</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Amazing! <strong>Mypy warns you about a status you forgot to handle!</strong> The message also includes the value, <code>OrderStatus.Scheduled</code>. If you use a modern editor such as VSCode you can get these warnings immediately as you type:</p>
<figure><img alt="mypy Error in VSCode" src="https://hakibenita.com/images/00-python-mypy-exhaustive-checking.png"><figcaption>mypy Error in VSCode</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>You can now go ahead and fix your function to handle the missing status:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>def</span> <span>handle_order</span><span>(</span><span>status</span><span>:</span> <span>OrderStatus</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>None</span><span>:</span>
    <span>if</span> <span>status</span> <span>is</span> <span>OrderStatus</span><span>.</span><span>Pending</span><span>:</span>
        <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>'schedule order'</span><span>)</span>

<span>    <span>elif</span> <span>status</span> <span>is</span> <span>OrderStatus</span><span>.</span><span>Scheduled</span><span>:</span>
</span><span>        <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>'ship order'</span><span>)</span>
</span>
    <span>elif</span> <span>status</span> <span>is</span> <span>OrderStatus</span><span>.</span><span>Shipped</span><span>:</span>
        <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>'charge order'</span><span>)</span>

    <span>else</span><span>:</span>
        <span>assert_never</span><span>(</span><span>status</span><span>)</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Check with mypy again:</p>
<div><pre><span></span>$ mypy main.py
Success: no issues found in <span>1</span> <span>source</span> file
</pre></div>


<p>Great! You can now rest assure you handled all order statuses. The best part is that you did that with <strong>no unit tests</strong>, and there were <strong>no runtime errors</strong>. If you include mypy in your CI, the <strong>bad code will never make it into production</strong>.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="enumeration-types"><a href="#enumeration-types">Enumeration types</a></h2>
<p>In the previous section you used mypy to perform exhaustiveness check on an <code>Enum</code>. You can use mypy, and <code>assert_never</code> to perform exhaustiveness check on other enumeration types as well.</p>
<p><strong>Exhaustiveness Checking of a Union</strong></p>
<p>A <code>Union</code> type represents several possible types. For example, a function that casts an argument to <code>float</code> can look like this:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span><span>from</span> <span>typing</span> <span>import</span> <span>Union</span>
</span>
<span><span>def</span> <span>get_float</span><span>(</span><span>num</span><span>:</span> <span>Union</span><span>[</span><span>str</span><span>,</span> <span>float</span><span>])</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>float</span><span>:</span>
</span>    <span>if</span> <span>isinstance</span><span>(</span><span>num</span><span>,</span> <span>str</span><span>):</span>
        <span>return</span> <span>float</span><span>(</span><span>num</span><span>)</span>

    <span>else</span><span>:</span>
        <span>assert_never</span><span>(</span><span>num</span><span>)</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Check the function with mypy:</p>
<div><pre><span></span>$ mypy main.py
error: Argument <span>1</span> to <span>"assert_never"</span> has incompatible <span>type</span> <span>"float"</span><span>;</span> expected <span>"NoReturn"</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Whoops... you forgot to handle the <code>float</code> type in the code:</p>

<p>Great! mypy is happy...</p>
<p><strong>Exhaustiveness Checking of a Literal</strong></p>
<p>Another useful type is <code>Literal</code>. It is included in the built-in <code>typing</code> module since Python3.8, and prior to that it is part of the complementary <a href="https://pypi.org/project/typing-extensions/" rel="noopener"><code>typing_extensions</code> package</a>.</p>
<p>A <code>Literal</code> is used to type primitive values such as strings and numbers. <code>Literal</code> is also an enumeration type, so you can use exhaustiveness checking on it as well:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>from</span> <span>typing_extensions</span> <span>import</span> <span>Literal</span>

<span>Color</span> <span>=</span> <span>Literal</span><span>[</span><span>'R'</span><span>,</span> <span>'G'</span><span>,</span> <span>'B'</span><span>]</span>

<span>def</span> <span>get_color_name</span><span>(</span><span>color</span><span>:</span> <span>Color</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>str</span><span>:</span>
    <span>if</span> <span>color</span> <span>==</span> <span>'R'</span><span>:</span>
        <span>return</span> <span>'Red'</span>
    <span>elif</span> <span>color</span> <span>==</span> <span>'G'</span><span>:</span>
        <span>return</span> <span>'Green'</span>
    <span># elif color == 'B':</span>
    <span>#     return 'Blue'</span>
    <span>else</span><span>:</span>
        <span>assert_never</span><span>(</span><span>color</span><span>)</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Checking the code without the commented part will produce the following error:</p>
<div><pre><span></span>$ mypy main.py
error: Argument <span>1</span> to <span>"assert_never"</span> has incompatible <span>type</span> <span>"Literal['B']"</span><span>;</span> expected <span>"NoReturn"</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Very handy indeed!</p>

<h2 id="type-narrowing-in-mypy"><a href="#type-narrowing-in-mypy">Type Narrowing in Mypy</a></h2>
<p>Now that you've seen what <code>assert_never</code> can do, you can try and understand how it works. <code>assert_never</code> works alongside <strong>"type narrowing"</strong>, which is a mypy feature where the type of a variable is narrowed based on the control flow of the program. In other words, mypy is gradually eliminating possible types for a variable.</p>
<p>First, it's important to understand how various things translate to a <code>Union</code> type in mypy:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>Optional</span><span>[</span><span>int</span><span>]</span>
<span># Equivalent to Union[int, None]</span>

<span>Literal</span><span>[</span><span>'string'</span><span>,</span> <span>42</span><span>,</span> <span>True</span><span>]</span>
<span># Equivalent to Union[Literal['string'], Literal[42], Literal[True]]</span>

<span>class</span> <span>Suit</span><span>(</span><span>Enum</span><span>):</span>
    <span>Clubs</span> <span>=</span> <span>"♣"</span>
    <span>Diamonds</span> <span>=</span> <span>"♦"</span>
    <span>Hearts</span> <span>=</span> <span>"♥"</span>
    <span>Spades</span> <span>=</span> <span>"♠"</span>

<span>Suit</span>
<span># ~Equivalent to Union[</span>
<span>#   Literal[Suit.Clubs],</span>
<span>#   Literal[Suit.Diamonds],</span>
<span>#   Literal[Suit.Hearts],</span>
<span>#   Literal[Suit.Spades]</span>
<span># ]</span>
</pre></div>


<p>To display the type of an expression, mypy provides a useful utility called <a href="https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/common_issues.html#reveal-type" rel="noopener"><code>reveal_type</code></a>. Using <code>reveal_type</code> you can ask mypy to show you the inferred type for a variable at the point it's called:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>def</span> <span>describe_suit</span><span>(</span><span>suit</span><span>:</span> <span>Optional</span><span>[</span><span>Suit</span><span>])</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>str</span><span>:</span>
<span>    <span># Revealed type is Union[Suit, None]</span>
</span>    <span>reveal_type</span><span>(</span><span>suit</span><span>)</span>
</pre></div>


<p>In the function above, the reveled type of <code>suit</code> is <code>Union[Suit, None]</code>, which is the type of the argument <code>suit</code>.</p>
<p>At this point you haven't done anything in the function, so mypy is unable to narrow down the type. Next, add some logic and see how mypy narrows down the type of the variable <code>suit</code>:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>def</span> <span>describe_suit</span><span>(</span><span>suit</span><span>:</span> <span>Optional</span><span>[</span><span>Suit</span><span>])</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>str</span><span>:</span>
<span>    <span>assert</span> <span>suit</span> <span>is</span> <span>not</span> <span>None</span>
</span><span>    <span># Revealed type is Suit</span>
</span>    <span>reveal_type</span><span>(</span><span>suit</span><span>)</span>
</pre></div>


<p>After eliminating the option of suit being <code>None</code>, the revealed type is <code>Suit</code>. Mypy used your program's logic to narrow the type of the variable.</p>
<p>Keep in mind, the type <code>Suit</code> is equivalent to the type <code>Union[Literal[Suit.Clubs], Literal[Suit.Diamonds], Literal[Suit.Hearts], Literal[Suit.Spades]]</code>, so next, try to narrow down the type even more:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>def</span> <span>describe_suit</span><span>(</span><span>suit</span><span>:</span> <span>Optional</span><span>[</span><span>Suit</span><span>])</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>str</span><span>:</span>
    <span>assert</span> <span>suit</span> <span>is</span> <span>not</span> <span>None</span>

<span>    <span>if</span> <span>suit</span> <span>is</span> <span>Suit</span><span>.</span><span>Clubs</span><span>:</span>
</span><span>        <span># Revealed type is Literal[Suit.Clubs]</span>
</span>        <span>reveal_type</span><span>(</span><span>suit</span><span>)</span>
        <span>return</span> <span>"Clubs"</span>

<span>    <span># Revealed type is Literal[Suit.Diamonds, Suit.Hearts, Suit.Spades]</span>
</span>    <span>reveal_type</span><span>(</span><span>suit</span><span>)</span>
</pre></div>


<p>After checking if <code>suit</code> is <code>Suit.Clubs</code>, mypy is able to narrow down the type to <code>Suit.Clubs</code>. Mypy is also smart enough to understand that if the condition does not hold, the variable <em>is definitely not</em> <code>Clubs</code>, and narrows down the type to <code>Diamonds</code>, <code>Hearts</code> or <code>Spades</code>.</p>
<p>Mypy can also use other conditional statements to further narrow the type, for example:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>def</span> <span>describe_suit</span><span>(</span><span>suit</span><span>:</span> <span>Optional</span><span>[</span><span>Suit</span><span>])</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>str</span><span>:</span>
    <span>assert</span> <span>suit</span> <span>is</span> <span>not</span> <span>None</span>

    <span>if</span> <span>suit</span> <span>is</span> <span>Suit</span><span>.</span><span>Clubs</span><span>:</span>
        <span># Revealed type is Literal[Suit.Clubs]</span>
        <span>reveal_type</span><span>(</span><span>suit</span><span>)</span>
        <span>return</span> <span>"Clubs"</span>

    <span># Revealed type is Literal[Suit.Diamonds, Suit.Hearts, Suit.Spades]</span>
    <span>reveal_type</span><span>(</span><span>suit</span><span>)</span>

<span>    <span># `and`, `or` and `not` also work.</span>
</span><span>    <span>if</span> <span>suit</span> <span>is</span> <span>Suit</span><span>.</span><span>Diamonds</span> <span>or</span> <span>suit</span> <span>is</span> <span>Suit</span><span>.</span><span>Spades</span><span>:</span>
</span><span>        <span># Revealed type is Literal[Suit.Diamonds, Suit.Spades]</span>
</span>        <span>reveal_type</span><span>(</span><span>suit</span><span>)</span>
        <span>return</span> <span>"Diamonds or Spades"</span>

<span>    <span># Revealed type is Literal[Suit.Hearts]</span>
</span><span>    <span>reveal_type</span><span>(</span><span>suit</span><span>)</span>
</span></pre></div>


<p>By the end of the function, mypy narrowed down the type of <code>suit</code> to <code>Suit.Hearts</code>. If, for example, you add a condition that imply a different type for <code>suit</code>, mypy will issue an error:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>def</span> <span>describe_suit</span><span>(</span><span>suit</span><span>:</span> <span>Optional</span><span>[</span><span>Suit</span><span>])</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>str</span><span>:</span>
    <span>assert</span> <span>suit</span> <span>is</span> <span>not</span> <span>None</span>

    <span>if</span> <span>suit</span> <span>is</span> <span>Suit</span><span>.</span><span>Clubs</span><span>:</span>
        <span># Revealed type is Literal[Suit.Clubs]</span>
        <span>reveal_type</span><span>(</span><span>suit</span><span>)</span>
        <span>return</span> <span>"Clubs"</span>

    <span># Revealed type is Literal[Suit.Diamonds, Suit.Hearts, Suit.Spades]</span>

                <p>According to CBI Insights, “running out of money” is the second of the <a href="https://www.cbinsights.com/research/startup-failure-reasons-top/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">top 20 reasons why businesses fail</a>. It’s not the only money-related issue. Pricing and cost issues, lack of a business model, and poor marketing intersect with monetization, too. Though monetization potential is very important, distribution is even more important!</p>
<p>A quick note, that the #1 reason, “no market need” is largely addressed by sticking to a <a href="https://perceptionbox.io/business/software-outsourcing-to-boost-startups-and-mvps/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Minimum Viable Product</a> (MVP) development process. The MVP process focuses on asking the tough questions first. Do customers love your product? Will they buy it? How much will they pay for it? These focus on finding a great product-market fit which also means creating a competitive product.</p>
<p>Distribution methods play a very important part in your software’s monetization potential.<br>
As <a href="https://www.smaato.com/blog/android-vs-ios-app-monetization/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Smaato</a> points out, “iPhone users spend on average over <a href="https://blog.soomla.com/2019/01/app-monetization-android-vs-ios.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$30 per online transaction</a>, compared to an average of $10 that Android users spend.” So, in all cases, you want to do your marketing research. Some of us on the marketing side have heard from tech companies that “They don’t need marketing.” With few exceptions – companies taking that stance either don’t last long or get bought out.</p>

                <p>Say, you’re in the breakfast cereal business. If you get your product in Walmart and Kroger, you’ve done well. Do you stop there? No. There’s still Albertsons, Safeway, HEB, 7-11s, corner stores, restaurants, and hotel chains. But, you have to prove to each that your product is worthy of their shelf space. If your product has a $10 price tag, distributors and retailers will take at least half as their share. You have to cover the warehousing, cost of promotions, and damages.</p>
<p>Many mobile app developers place their apps on Google Play and the App Store and call their distribution efforts “done.” For a very lucky minority, this can work. Even so, it’s by no means optimal and it’s one reason (of many) why so many mobile apps never made money. For one thing, it’s super freakin’ lazy – to be polite about it.</p>
<ul>
<li>If your app meets store guidelines – you’re basically guaranteed “shelf-space.”</li>
<li>It takes, at most, two hours to set up a new app on independent app stores.</li>
<li>No warehousing, no shipping costs for downloads, no damages.</li>
<li>No expensive promotional displays.</li>
<li>Most online stores take just 30% of sales.</li>
</ul>
<p>Granted no independent app stores have nearly the traffic as the Big Two. However, that fact alone also makes it easier to get exposure on them and be a big fish in a small pond.</p>
<p>Your team has spent months developing a software project. It’s worth the effort to have one person spend a few days expanding its distribution channels. Each is a “point of presence” – and helps to develop branding a la McDonald’s or Starbucks. Overall, it costs the same to develop a software product whether it is ultimately delivered to one or one million people. The goal, as with any product, is to get it into the hands of as many customers as inexpensively as possible.</p>

                <p>With the Internet, packaged software is the oddball as it incurs the extra cost and effort of developing <a href="https://site.handshake.com/blog/how-to-wholesale" target="_blank" rel="noopener">brick-n-mortar retail distribution</a> channels. But, it is possible to forego the packaged distribution effort and simply make the hard copy materials a purchase option. Desktop titles typically include a DVD for installation and a user manual. Gaming companies often have collector editions adding maps, art books, and assorted game paraphernalia. Basic options typically incur a $10-20 surcharge on the price of the electronic version. Premium options can add $20 to $80, or more, to the cost.</p>
<p>Companies like Microsoft, Apple, Sony, and Electronic Arts, among others, have the economy of scale and distribution channels to get good mileage from packaged software. Other companies should validate every packaged software aspect with their user-base before jumping into it. Startups are likely better off avoiding packaged software unless there’s active end-user demand.</p>
<p>Demand can be evaluated via crowdfunding campaigns starting off with a small, first-run packaged edition. Additional options can be opened if funding benchmarks are reached. Alternatively, if sales of electronic versions go well, you can always expand your packaged options later. Nevertheless, any effort in selling or developing distribution channels for packaged software involves a very significant physical effort. Print On-Demand services can help streamline portions of the effort.</p>

                <p>Exponentially easier to develop and manage if only because you don’t have to worry about inventory or physical distribution efforts. If you have a software product, a website, and a Paypal account, you could be in business today! Retail shelf space isn’t an issue either. As long as your software meets store policies you should have no problems getting on most online (non-brand specific) software or app stores.</p>
<p>Another advantage is that most online stores only take a 30% commission. Both the App Store and Google Play reduce their commissions on subscription-based apps to 15% after one year. If you are selling internationally, for best effect you should pro-rate your cover price to accommodate purchasing power parity with different countries.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, top-shelf software and brand names do best with premium sales. Their core advantage applies via the marketing and advertising dollars they can throw at promoting their products. Their advantage is magnified by promoting new releases across the user-base of all of their other products. With different product strategies, premium software can employ most other monetization options except in-app advertising.</p>

    <p>We humans are social beings; we need to be around others, share our time and stories and gossip, the warmth of physical contact, and the display and feeling of love. It's in our nature. Since the internet's appearance, we've tried to fulfill this need with virtual calls, meetings, and gatherings—which render extremely useful in professional settings but don't suffice in our personal lives. We communicate in shallow ways via social media and instant messaging and connect more deeply through audio and video calls. Yet, all of this is insufficient for our well-being, and we often get a false sense of connection.</p>
<p>The big tech companies are working on immersive virtual and augmented realities to shorten the gap between the experience of in-person meetings and their virtual equivalents. Facebook Horizon lets you 'explore and create' collaboratively with virtual avatars. Apple—reportedly engineering a pair of augmented reality glasses, a headset along the lines of Google Glass and Microsoft HoloLens—is preparing to release augmented reality from the limitations of smartphones and tablets.
In these environments,
astonishing visuals would make participants believe they're in the same room,
haptic feedback would fool their bodies into thinking they're touching objects,
and brain waves could help them hallucinate the rest, ala Black Mirror.</p>
<p>If it were to reduce the risk of infecting ourselves and our loved ones during this (and future) pandemics while meeting our psychological and social needs, this scenario doesn't sound bad at all.</p>
<p>For now, nothing beats sitting together and holding each others' hands, even if wearing a face mask. But, of course, this isn't always a possibility.</p>
<p>As these immersive technologies improve, we'll rely on them more and more, replacing long-distance travel, hazardous physical interactions, and face masks with virtual gatherings and wearables.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, here's a reminder to myself: Protect what you have by being mindful and patient; better times lie ahead.</p>

  <p>
    If you've ever managed any software project, you've probably asked
    yourself: how could our teams move faster? How fast are we moving today?
  </p>

  <p>
    For these kinds of questions, it's tempting to turn to metrics. After all,
    we use metrics routinely and successfully when we develop software. There's
    performance, production load, and uptime metrics. There are also metrics
    based on customer behavior, like conversion and retention. These metrics
    don't just provide visibility. More importantly, they create a feedback
    loop. We can make a change that is intended to improve something, and use
    metrics to see how much improvement there really was. Developer wisdom says
    that every software performance optimization must start with a measure,
    which makes perfect sense.
  </p>

  <p>
    Since metrics are so helpful, can't we apply them to software development
    speed? As better development processes should improve development output,
    maybe output metrics could measure whether processes really improved. So
    then, what metrics could we use?
  </p>

  
  <h2 id="we-dont-have-any-good-metrics-for-that">
    <a href="#we-dont-have-any-good-metrics-for-that">We don't have any good metrics for that</a>
  </h2>


  <p>
    Development speed is the amount of work produced per unit of time, so we
    need to measure both output and time. Measuring time is simple, no problem
    there. What about work output? Attempts to measure it are as old as
    software itself. Through the years one thing's held true: whenever we
    decide a metric measures work output, something unintended soon follows.
    Consider the following examples:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <b>Lines of code</b> - Probably the oldest one. Almost no one takes it
      seriously today. Counting code lines just makes the code bloated and the
      developers focus on the simplest task possible;
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>No. of commits</b> - encourages developers to break up their commits
      into many parts. Once again, the focus is on the simplest tasks and
      refactorings. Complex problems are avoided;
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>No. of tasks completed</b> - leads to tasks being split into subtasks.
      Every problem, even minor, is submitted as a task. Also adds an incentive
      to cut corners to complete tasks as fast as possible;
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>No. of bugs, or percentage of bugs</b> - not a metric of work output,
      but work quality. Discourages developers from making changes, and makes
      them reluctant to report bugs that they found themselves;
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>Man-hours or storypoints</b> - when estimates form the basis for how
      team performance is measured, it's easy to guess what comes next —
      inflated estimates;
    </li>
    <li>... and so on.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Developers are smart. They specialize in cracking complex problems. For any
    metric you give them, they'll find the easiest way to improve on it. This
    way most likely won't correlate with work quality or desired project
    outcome. This doesn't necessarily mean that developers will game them. I'd
    say it depends on the context and how strong the incentives are. But one
    thing is certain - developers will realize that the measure of their
    productivity is disconnected from what matters. This is not only
    frustrating. It also distracts them from doing the real work.
  </p>

  
  <h2 id="but-why">
    <a href="#but-why">But why?</a>
  </h2>


  <p>
    Why do metrics work so well for software products, and not for measuring
    developer output? Is it some kind of developer conspiracy? Actually, if you
    look outside of software development, you'll find more examples where
    metrics work well, and where they don't.

    <b>Where metrics work well:</b> manufacturing and sales. Let's take the
    manufacture and sale of cups. You can measure production output, i.e. no.
    of cups produced per unit of time, and production quality — percentage of
    cups that failed to pass quality control. On the sales side, you can
    measure sales volume and profit margin. These metrics are really helpful
    for management. For example, the goal for the manufacturing department can
    be to improve the percentage of cups that successfully pass quality control,
    while keeping unit costs low. The head of sales can aim to increase sales
    volume or improve profit margins. Improvements in these metrics are good
    for business, so we can also treat them as a measure of efficiency of
    corresponding departments.
  </p>

  <p>
    <b>Where metrics don't work:</b> measuring scientific output. Scientists
    publish their research in articles. Now science also has some metrics that
    measure work output and quality: no. of articles published, no. of
    citations, statistical significance of the results. Can we say that a
    scientist who published 10 articles has produced twice as much value as a
    scientist who published 5? Unlikely. Works differ too much in their value.
    Even without numbers, it's often hard to say which work is more valuable.
    Because "hacking" one's number of publications  and citations is a
    well-known problem in the scientific community, they're not considered
    reliable indicators of work productivity. Statistical significance has its
    own issues too -
    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42QuXLucH3Q" target="_blank">
      p-hacking is a wide-spread problem</a>.
  </p>

  
  <h2 id="two-key-criteria">
    <a href="#two-key-criteria">Two key criteria</a>
  </h2>


  <p>
    In any context, metrics that work well share two important criteria:
  </p>

  <ol>
    <li>
      They relate directly to value;
    </li>
    <li>
      These values are consistent, i.e. in countable quantities of
      interchangeable units.
    </li>
  </ol>

  <p>
    Let's take a look at the examples above:
  </p>

  <p>
    Metrics in manufacturing and sales satisfy both criteria. In cups
    manufacturing, value is represented in cups. Since it's mass produced,
    cups are identical. In sales, value is measured in dollars. The business
    goal is to make money, so money's relationship with business value is as
    direct as possible. As one dollar is equal to any other, metrics based on
    money measure consistent values.
  </p>

  <p>
    In science, these criteria aren't satisfied. We can't find a metric that
    would measure the value of scientific results directly. We have only
    indirect metrics, like no. of articles and citations, which can be hacked.
    In any case, these metrics aren't consistent either, because all
    publications are not made of interchangeable units.
  </p>

  
  <h2 id="developer-metrics-fail-both-criteria">
    <a href="#developer-metrics-fail-both-criteria">Developer metrics fail both criteria</a>
  </h2>


  <p>
    What do we have to measure developer output? Lines of code, no. of commits,
    no. of tasks completed, man-hours, storypoints… Considering these metrics
    against the two key criteria above, you'll find that:
  </p>

  <ol>
    <li>
      None of them relate directly to value. We don't ship our customers lines
      of code, man-hours, or storypoints. They don't care how many commits we
      made or how many tasks we completed;
    </li>
    <li>
      All these measurements are inconsistent. One commit is not equal to
      another, one line of code is not as valuable as the other line, all tasks
      are also different, and man-hours and storypoints are based on estimates,
      which are by definition inaccurate.
    </li>
  </ol>

  <p>
    It's no surprise that none of these metrics work well.
  </p>

  <p>
    Why don't we have metrics for developers that would relate directly to
    value? For the same reason we don't have any for scientists. Developers,
    just like scientists, always create something new. They don't write the
    same code again and again — that wouldn't make sense. Code can be re-used
    in a variety of ways — you can either extract it to a module or a library,
    or, as a last resort, just copy and paste it. Every developers' workday is
    unique. Even if they solve similar problems, they solve them in a different
    context, or a new way, each time.

  <p>
    Of course, no one today seriously talks about measuring developers' output
    in lines of code. There should be something more modern, right?

    The book <i>Accelerate</i> from 2018 presents research on 2000
    organizations of different sizes. The research goal was to identify which
    metrics would differentiate high performers from low. Here's what they
    found:

  </p>

  <p>
    We can see four metrics here. Let's see how these metrics relate to value,
    and whether they're consistent:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <b>Deployment frequency</b> - I can see why it's listed here. The more
      frequently you ship to production, the more reliable the shipping process
      becomes. Productive teams tend to ship code more frequently. However,
      correlation doesn't imply causation. It's not directly related to
      customer value. People want a product that satisfies their needs, not a
      product that changes as frequently as possible. The metric is also
      inconsistent, because one change shipped to production is not equal to
      another.
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>Lead time</b> - the time for satisfying customer requests. This one
      relates more closely to value, because we're talking about the changes
      customers have asked for. However, it's not a metric with consistent
      units, because requests are not equal to each other. Some might be
      simple, and …</li></ul></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><h2 id="whats-in-this-post">What’s in this post?</h2><p>Enough about the insides of Postgres indexes to impress your coworkers at the coffee machine or recruiters at a job interview 🤓.</p><p>We’ll have a look at B-Tree, Hash, GIN, GiST, BRIN indexes and focus on demystifying them.</p><h2 id="why-the-hell-do-i-even-need-an-index">Why the hell do I even need an index?</h2><p>Indexes are at the core of any querying in relational databases (the classic SQL databases like Postgres or MySQL). Therefore it is very rewarding and important to have an idea of how they work.</p><p>An illustration is worth a thousand words so let’s take an example. Let’s say we have a <code>user</code> table containing 1M million entries (or rows):</p><div><pre><code data-lang="sql"><span>CREATE</span> <span>TABLE</span> <span>user</span> (
  id   SERIAL <span>PRIMARY</span> <span>KEY</span>,
  name TEXT,
  age  INTEGER
);
</code></pre></div><p>We want to know how many of our users are above 30. We run:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="sql"><span>SELECT</span> <span>COUNT</span>(<span>*</span>) <span>FROM</span> <span>user</span> <span>WHERE</span> age <span>&gt;</span> <span>30</span>;
</code></pre></div><p>Without any extra index, the database would have to go over the 1M entries one by one, look at their age and increment a counter for all the users above 30:</p><p><img src="https://fabien.herfray.org/images/mastering-postgres-indexes-in-10-minutes/scan.png" alt="scan"></p><p>If it feels like an inefficient way of getting the result it’s because it is 💁‍♀️. It would be a slow query (called a “full table scan”, as every row needs to be scanned).</p><p>That’s where indexation comes into play. It will allow us to quickly locate the users we’re interested in, without having to lookup all the rows.</p><p>In Postgres, there are 5 types of indexes:</p><ul><li>B-Trees</li><li>Hashes</li><li>GINs</li><li>GiSTs</li><li>BRINs</li></ul><h2 id="before-we-start">Before we start</h2><h3 id="naming">Naming</h3><ul><li><strong>Row</strong>: An entry in the database (e.g. a user). Also called tuple.</li><li><strong>Column</strong>: An attribute of a row (e.g. the first name of a user).</li><li><strong>Table</strong>: A collection of rows (e.g. a user table).</li><li><strong>TID</strong>: Tuple ID. It’s an internal Postgres ID. It describes where to find the row on the disk.</li><li><strong>Operator</strong>: Reserved keyword representing operations on data (e.g. <code>AND</code>, <code>+</code>, <code>&gt;</code>, <code>=</code>).</li><li><strong>Statement</strong>: Database operation (e.g. <code>CREATE TABLE user (name TEXT);</code>).</li><li><strong>Query</strong>: Statement that returns data (e.g. <code>SELECT * FROM user;</code>)</li></ul><h3 id="core-assumptions">Core assumptions</h3><ul><li>In general, an index needs to be able to fit in RAM to be fully efficient. That’s why having very large indexes can be problematic.</li><li>Fetching the row behind a <code>tid</code> is easy and relatively cheap to do. We consider it roughly equivalent to getting an element from an array by index (e.g. <code>var a = array[i]</code>).</li><li>We’ll only talk about read operations (queries). How to propagate writes to indexes is a whole other story.</li><li>Everything is more complex and complicated in real life, this post tries to explain things on a very high level and may be approximate on some parts. For more details, one should have a look at the <code>Further explanation</code> links.</li></ul><h2 id="b-tree-indexes">B-Tree indexes</h2><h3 id="usecase">Usecase</h3><p>So we want to index this query. We want to make it faster:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="sql"><span>SELECT</span> <span>COUNT</span>(<span>*</span>) <span>FROM</span> <span>user</span> <span>WHERE</span> age <span>&gt;</span> <span>30</span>;
</code></pre></div><p>We create a B-Tree index on the <code>age</code> column.</p><div><pre><code data-lang="sql"><span>CREATE</span> <span>INDEX</span> user_by_age <span>ON</span> <span>user</span> (age);
</code></pre></div><p>No need to specify anything, B-Tree is the default index for Postgres and many other databases including MySQL, Oracle or SQL Server.</p><h3 id="how-does-it-work">How does it work</h3><p>A binary search tree (<strong>different from a B-Tree</strong>) is a well known data structure where every node of the tree has two children nodes. The values of the left and right children being respectively smaller and larger than their parent’s value.</p><p>A B-Tree is a generalised binary search tree where every node can have more than two children.</p><p><img src="https://fabien.herfray.org/images/mastering-postgres-indexes-in-10-minutes/tree_comparison.png" alt="tree comparison"></p><p>A very helpful property of these trees is that their values are sorted. It makes it easy to lookup values. Exactly what we need to speed up our query!</p><p>Now a B-Tree index is slightly more than just a B-Tree. It is a linked list of tids, sorted by value and linked to a B-Tree.</p><p>Let’s run our query again and see how it looks like:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="sql"><span>SELECT</span> <span>COUNT</span>(<span>*</span>) <span>FROM</span> <span>user</span> <span>WHERE</span> age <span>&gt;</span> <span>30</span>;
</code></pre></div><p><img src="https://fabien.herfray.org/images/mastering-postgres-indexes-in-10-minutes/btree.png" alt="btree"></p><p>That was much easier! By using the sorting of the tree nodes, we can now quickly find the first user being above 30 and count from there. Remember? The linked list at the bottom is sorted by age!</p><p>As a side note, you may be wondering about multicolumn indexes, like:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="sql"><span>CREATE</span> <span>INDEX</span> user_by_age_and_height <span>ON</span> <span>user</span> (age, height_cm);
</code></pre></div><p>The simplest way to visualize it is to imagine it as being roughly equivalent to a monocolumn index like:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="sql"><span>CREATE</span> <span>INDEX</span> user_by_age_and_height <span>ON</span> <span>user</span> (age<span>+</span><span>'-'</span><span>+</span>height_cm);
</code></pre></div><p>The B-Tree mechanism stays the same, but the values that are being sorted are now for example <code>28-182</code>.</p><p>This explains why the index wouldn’t help with trying to run:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="sql"><span>SELECT</span> <span>COUNT</span>(<span>*</span>) <span>FROM</span> <span>user</span> <span>WHERE</span> height_cm <span>&gt;</span> <span>160</span>;
</code></pre></div><p>In the tree, values like <code>28-182</code> are not sorted by height. They are sorted by age, and then for every individual age they are sorted by height.</p><p>On the other hand, the index would help us with this query:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="sql"><span>SELECT</span> <span>COUNT</span>(<span>*</span>) <span>FROM</span> <span>user</span> <span>WHERE</span> age <span>=</span> <span>30</span> <span>AND</span> height_cm <span>&gt;</span> <span>160</span>;
</code></pre></div><h3 id="tldr-too-long-didnt-read">TLDR (Too Long Didn’t Read)</h3><ul><li>B-Tree is the default index in many databases.</li><li>Is it so popular because it’s fast, efficient and flexible.</li><li>It makes operations like <code>=</code>, <code>&lt;</code>, <code>&lt;=</code>, <code>&gt;</code>, <code>&gt;=</code>, <code>ORDER BY</code> or even <code>LIKE</code> faster.</li><li>A rule of thumb would be: if you need to speed up the above operations, use a B-Tree index unless there is a specific reason not to.</li></ul><h3 id="further-explanation">Further explanation</h3><ul><li><a href="https://www.qwertee.io/blog/postgresql-b-tree-index-explained-part-1/">https://www.qwertee.io/blog/postgresql-b-tree-index-explained-part-1/</a></li><li><a href="https://habr.com/en/company/postgrespro/blog/443284">https://habr.com/en/company/postgrespro/blog/443284</a></li></ul><h2 id="hash-indexes">Hash indexes</h2><h3 id="usecase-1">Usecase</h3><p>We’re only querying using the <code>=</code> operator and we’re having very specific scaling/performance issues (e.g. our table is huge and a B-Tree would be too large to fit in memory).

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-id="3f5a1f3" data-element_type="widget" data-widget_type="theme-post-content.default"><div><p>It can be tough when writing an email. Your end goal is to get your message across. Therefore, this blog post is going to show you how to professionally end an email, making look professional, and creating a good impression of you.</p><p>Don’t forget people not only form an impression of you, but also about your business. Creating an amazing impression could mean more business opportunities.</p><p>So it can be critical to learn how to end an email professionally.</p><p>In addition, if the end of your email doesn’t give the impression that you are professional and you know what you are doing. It could annoy the people who receive your emails.</p><p>You don’t want to annoy, rattle, or downright offend anyone you are emailing. So you need to learn the best practices to profession end an email.</p><p>That’s what this blog is about. Helping you end an email using the right words.</p><h2>Four Ways To Professionally End An Email</h2><p>I’ll start by running through four different scenarios.</p><p>In each scenario, you should end your professionally written emails differently.</p><h3>Asking For Feedback</h3><p>The key to asking for feedback is to present an “attitude of gratitude”.</p><p>Studies have shown being grateful for something another person has done for you, helps you build strong and long-lasting relationships.</p><p>It also shows you in a good light, people will think good things about you.</p><p>You can use this to your advantage when trying to get a bit of feedback from one of the recipients.</p><p>For example you could end with something like:</p><p>“I appreciate your help in resolving this matter”</p><p>“Thanks in advance for your time”.</p><p>“Looking forward to hearing from you”</p><p>“Thank you for your time. Let me know whether we can meet up for a coffee.”</p><p>My personal favorite and how I end a lot of my emails in these sorts of situations is.</p><p>“Thank you for your time and for reading this far/reading this email”</p><p>I learned this ending from <a href="https://tim.blog/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tim Ferriss</a>. I love it, as it doesn’t ask too much from the recipient. Sometimes ending with “I look forward to hearing from you”, implies you expect a reply.</p><p>By using this ending, it shows thanks and appreciation toward the recipients for both their time and for reading your email.</p><p>Therefore, painting you in a good light, which is what we are aiming for.</p><p>However, what if someone takes an age to reply back to your email? If needed, you could send them a little reminder.</p><p>You could use Outflash’s <a href="https://outflash.xyz/email-tracking/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">email tracking</a> to see if someone has opened and clicked your email. Allowing you to set a reminder to follow up with someone, that you know has read your email.</p><h3>Build A New Relationship</h3><p>You have a new lead. Or you have met someone at a <a href="https://www.meetup.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Meet Up</a> event and you want to build up a relationship to promote yourself and your business.</p><p>A good way to start is by showing them that you care. End your emails with things like.</p><p>“Keep fighting the good fight”.</p><p>“Stay awesome”.</p><p>Another way, which I prefer is offering something that brings them value and supports them in what they are trying to achieve.</p><p>For example</p><p>“P.S. Here is [your offer/something of use] you might find interesting”</p><p>Link to something like a blog post, YouTube video. Or some other premium content like and eBook or info graphic.</p><p>This shows the recipient that you care and are willing to help them out. Without necessarily getting something upfront in return.</p><h3>“Lets Meet For A Coffee”</h3><p>Let’s say you work for <a href="https://outflash.xyz/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Outflash</a> as a sales professional and are chatting with a potential new client about our <a href="https://outflash.xyz/email-scheduling/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">email scheduling</a> and <a href="https://outflash.xyz/mail-merge/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">easy mail merge </a>functionality.</p><p>The new lead agrees to meet with you for a coffee and discuss how <a href="https://outflash.xyz/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Outflash</a> can benefit them.</p><p>This is a great opportunity for you to end the email by pre-framing what you would like to discuss.</p><p>You can end you emails either by saying.</p><p>“Look forward to meeting you soon”</p><p>“Talk to you soon”</p><p>However, this is very generic. What I also like to add on to the end of the email is some information about the features I would like to discuss when we meet for a coffee.</p><p>For example</p><p>“I hope [link to some valuable information] will help you understand our tool a bit more.</p><p>This is a great way to direct the conversation before you even meet up. It shows you have thought about what you would like to discuss. So they don’t feel the coffee will be a waste of their time.</p><h3>Requesting A Meeting</h3><p>If you would like to meet a new client or potential lead. You have to find a way to get them on board with the idea.</p><p>After giving them lots of reasons why it would be a good idea for the meeting you can add:</p><p>“Eager to work around your schedule”</p><p>“Hoping for sometime in your calendar”</p><p>Remember, people value their time and don’t want to give it away for free.</p><p>You have to show them or provide them with some value to display to them that the meeting with be of benefit to them.</p><p>How can you do that?</p><p>The best way is to add a P.S that shows them what the meeting will be about and how much time it should take.</p><p>For example</p><p>“P.S. I promise a good ROI for your 30 minute meeting with me. You’ll walk away with [something of tangible value].</p><p>There are lots of way to do this. Remember you want to end the email in a way that prompts the recipient to take action in a way that you would like.</p><h2>Professionally End An Email – The Close</h2><p>Using the examples above. you will have ended your email with the correct wording that reflects the goal of your email.</p><p>Next, you should focus on how to professionally end the email.</p><p>It’s important to have all these points in the professional email closing. And they should be formatted in the right way.</p><p>1) Closing remark – ensure you include a comma after your closing remark. And then include space before going to the next element.</p><p>2) Signature – embed your digital signature here if you have one. Otherwise, leave it blank.</p><p>3) Leave a space, then type your full name.</p><p>4) Your title and the company you work for.</p><p>5) Contact information.</p><p>Now you have seen how to end an email professionally. Let’s review how to professionally end an email with a runthough.</p><h3>Example Of How to Professionally End An Email</h3><p>Here is an example email that at first glances looks like it is a well written email.</p><pre><code>Hi Steve,

I'd love to discuss your company's software development requirements with you. Here are a couple of time slots that works for me.

Tuesday at 3 PM
Thursday at 1 PM

Let me know if these time suit you, or if another day works better for you and I can check my schedule. My number is [BEST NUMBER TO REACH YOU].

Phil.</code></pre><p>If you compared this email against a lot of the online email checklists out there. It will pass as good, clear, and concise.</p><p>So, what is wrong with it?</p><p>Well, it forgot to include the elements that make an good, professional email ending.</p><p>– No close phrase, so it sounds a little casual, not professional</p><p>– The email was closed using only my first name. How many Phil’s could the recipient know?</p><p>– There is no signature that details any contact information.</p><p>– There is no call to action. What do you want them to ultimately do from your email?</p><p>It could be that this email is easily ignored and deleted. Making you lose potential new customers.</p><p>Let’s run through what we have discussed in this post and see how we can professionally end the email above.</p><pre><code>Hi Steve,

We discussed how important gratitude is in an email.</p><p>Just writing ‘thanks’ makes your gratitude feel like an after thought and can make you sound not thankful at all.</p><h4>‘Thanks again’</h4><p>It’s even worse than ‘Thanks’ doesn’t seem genuine to the recipient.</p><h4>‘TTYL’, ‘TAFN’</h4><p>Do I need to explain these ones?</p><p>These are just unprofessional and are a bit confusing.</p><h4>‘Best Wishes’</h4><p>This one isn’t to bad and is deemed as formal. It may be OK on an initial email.</p><p>However, people see this sign off as ‘stuffy’ and forced.</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>A good ending to a professionally written email is as important as starting the email well.</p><p>It shows how professional you and your business are.</p><p>Also check out “<a href="https://outflash.xyz/email/professionally-start-an-email-the-dos-and-dont/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Professionally Start An Email</a>” which will show you how to start off your emails.</p><p>Email is a huge part of our day-to-day life and has become key in business and professional communication.</p><p>Becoming great at writing email isn’t that hard. You just need a framework and a bit of practice.</p><p>Use a bit of care and attention, just fire out the email. Who knows what could happen?</p><p>You may land that client, the amazing job, get that promotion you deserve. All because you crafted a professionally worded email.</p><p>So, go ahead and use the tips mentioned above and write that amazing email.</p><p>And don’t forget to comment on this post with some tips if you have mastered the art of emailing!</p></div></div></div>]]>

But the process is not always easy if you are used to working on Debian-like systems.<br>Today, we’ll see how to install it on a Raspberry Pi, to configure it and use it like almost like any other operating system.</p><p><strong>FreeBSD is an open-source operating system, available on Raspberry Pi since 2014. It’s a good solution for any usage (server or desktop)<br>It’s not based on Linux, as they develop their code for everything. Even if there are many similarities, it includes several differences, more or less visible.</strong></p><p><span data-ez-name="raspberrytips_com-medrectangle-4"></span>To help you as much as possible, I will start by an introduction to FreeBSD, then I’ll show you how to install it, and finally, everything you need to know to use it the way you want.</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> <em>I’m not an expert in BSD systems. I’m a fan of Pfsense which is based on FreeBSD, but I never really used it beside that.

So you can use it almost anywhere.</p><div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="500" height="183" src="data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHdpZHRoPSI1MDAiIGhlaWdodD0iMTgzIj48L3N2Zz4=" alt="" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" ezimgfmt="rs rscb30 src ng ngcb30 srcset" data-ezsrc="https://raspberrytips.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/freebsd-logo.jpg" data-ezsrcset="https://raspberrytips.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/freebsd-logo.jpg 500w,https://raspberrytips.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/freebsd-logo-300x110.jpg 300w"></figure></div><p>FreeBSD works on two branches :</p><ul><li><strong>STABLE</strong>: The main branch, each new major version is released from the STABLE branch (<strong>RELEASE</strong>)</li><li><strong>CURRENT</strong>: It’s the development branch, to get the latest improvements, but less speed and stability.</li></ul><div><div><div><p><a href="https://raspberrytips.com/master-raspberry-pi" target="_blank"><img src="data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHdpZHRoPSIzMDAiIGhlaWdodD0iMjczIj48L3N2Zz4=" ezimgfmt="rs rscb30 src ng ngcb30" data-ezsrc="https://raspberrytips.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/1603165223-300x273.jpg"></a></p><div><p><span>Master your Raspberry Pi in 30 days</span><br>From beginner to expert in Raspberry Pi.<br>Learn useful Linux skills and practice multiples projects with step-by-step guides.</p></div></div></div></div><h3><span id="Usage"></span>Usage<span></span></h3><p><strong>FreeBSD can be used in any situation. It’s fast, stable and secure</strong>. So it’s perfect for a Raspberry Pi, but also for a server or a desktop usage.<br>By the way, the FreeBSD FAQ is pretty clear about this:</p><blockquote><p><strong>Can FreeBSD replace my current operating system?<br></strong>For most people, yes.</p><cite><a href="https://www.freebsd.org/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/faq/introduction.html#:~:text=the%20FreeBSD%20Handbook.-,1.2.,any%20purpose%20without%20strings%20attached." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">FreeBSD documentation</a></cite></blockquote><p>We’ll see in the next parts how to install it on your Raspberry Pi, but it’s also a solid system for your computer or on server.</p><p><strong>FreeBSD has been adopted by many companies over the world.<br></strong>I already told you about Pfsense, but other brands like IBM, Apple or Sony are using parts of the FreeBSD code (for example, the PlayStation 4 system is a fork from FreeBSD).<br>Some NAS operating systems are also based on FreeBSD (FreeNAS for example).</p><h3><span id="FreeBSD_vs_Linux"></span>FreeBSD vs Linux<span></span></h3><p>As I told you in introduction, <strong>FreeBSD is not a Linux-based system</strong>.<br>Systems on Linux, are all using the same kernel and basic drivers, and then add many applications to offer a specific solution at the end.</p><p><strong>FreeBSD don’t use this base, they develop and release everything, including the kernel and drivers.</strong><br>However, the differences while using it are minimal (I will show you the main ones).<br>But you may have some commands working differently on Linux and FreeBSD.</p><h3><span id="FreeBSD_strengths"></span>FreeBSD strengths<span></span></h3><p>So, why do I need to try FreeBSD if it’s almost the same thing?<br>As always when I test systems, the main goal here is to experiment, and see how it works. So you’ll get more details at the end.</p><p>But in theory, <strong><span data-ez-name="raspberrytips_com-large-leaderboard-2"></span>FreeBSD is a minimal system that should be faster, more secure and with less compatibility issues than most Linux systems</strong>.<br>We’ll see now if this is true for the Raspberry Pi version 🙂</p><h2><span id="Install_FreeBSD_on_Raspberry_Pi"></span>Install FreeBSD on Raspberry Pi<span></span></h2><p>In this part, we’ll see how to install a basic FreeBSD system on your Raspberry Pi.</p><h3><span id="Raspberry_Pi_4"></span>Raspberry Pi 4<span></span></h3><p>During writing this tutorial, <strong>the Raspberry Pi 4 is not yet supported on the RELEASE version</strong> (12.x). But it works on CURRENT version (13.x).</p><p>So, if you have a Raspberry Pi 4, consider taking the latest version available. Currently, the 13.x and above are the only working for Raspberry Pi 4.<br>Unfortunately, if t’s a CURRENT version, it’s a debug one, with less stability and performances issues. But for a test it’s ok.</p><p><span data-ez-name="raspberrytips_com-leader-1"></span>The other option is to use a custom firmware, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://github.com/pftf/RPi4"

id="Download"></span>Download<span></span></h3><p><strong>FreeBSD offers pre-built images for the ARM and ARM64 architecture.<br></strong>The ARM64 version is working fine on Pi 3B+ and 4, I didn’t test on other models.</p><p>Here is the general link to the FTP server: <a href="https://download.freebsd.org/ftp/snapshots/">https://download.freebsd.org/ftp/</a><br>Once here, you have two choices:</p><ul><li><strong>Download the RELEASE version:</strong><ul><li>Open the releases subfolder and go to <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://download.freebsd.org/ftp/releases/ISO-IMAGES/" target="_blank">ISO-IMAGES</a>.</li><li>Select the version you want to install (12.1 for example).</li><li>Then, find the image corresponding to your Raspberry Pi model.<br>For example:<br><code>FreeBSD-12.1-RELEASE-arm64-aarch64-RPI3.img.xz</code><br>If you have the Raspberry Pi 3 (look for arm architecture, and the last part of the name correspond to the Raspberry Pi model).</li></ul></li><li><strong>Download the CURRENT version:</strong><ul><li>Go to snapshots and then <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://download.freebsd.org/ftp/snapshots/ISO-IMAGES/" target="_blank">ISO-IMAGES</a>.</li><li>Select the version you want (13.0 for example).</li><li>Same thing here, find the FreeBSD images corresponding to your model, for example:<br><code>FreeBSD-13.0-CURRENT-arm64-aarch64-RPI3-20200813-r364182.img.xz</code><br>Currently, there is no specific version for the Raspberry Pi 4, so take the RPI3 one.</li></ul></li></ul><p>Download the file you need on this server, and feel free to ask in the comments if you are lost with this, or if I need to update it for the latest versions.</p><h3><span id="SD_card_preparation"></span>SD card preparation<span></span></h3><p>Once you have the image on your computer, the installation part is similar to what you may already know

used in IoT applications, financial trading, industrial monitoring, machine
learning, and anywhere time series data lives. Our community showed a lot of
interest in integrations with third-party tools, and after adding Grafana
support earlier this year, ingesting data from Kafka topics was our next goal.</p><p>To build reliable support for Kafka, we improved our PostgreSQL wire protocol
implementation and introduced functionality that we thought readers might like
to hear about. As we fully avoid garbage collection, we bypassed Java's native
non-blocking IO and built our own notification system. To do this, we built a
configurable dispatcher that can delegate tasks to worker threads and uses
queues for events and socket connections. The result is a new generic network
stack used to handle all incoming network connections to QuestDB.</p><p>Kafka Connect support is now available since version 5.0.5, and the QuestDB
source is available to <a href="https://github.com/questdb/questdb" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">browse on GitHub</a>. If you like the
content and the new functionality or if you know of a better way to approach what
we built, we'd love to know your thoughts! Feel free to share your feedback
<a href="https://slack.questdb.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">in our Slack Community</a>.</p><h2>Flow control<a href="#flow-control" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p>When we have multiple nodes on a network, there are usually disparities in their
performance in computing power and network bandwidth. Some nodes can read
incoming packets at different rates than others, or conversely, some nodes may
be able to send data at a different rate.</p><p>Let's say we have a network with two nodes; a sender and a receiver. If the
sender can produce a lot more data than the receiver can read, the receiver is
likely to be overwhelmed. We're in luck, though, as TCP uses a built-in flow
control protocol that acts as a pressure valve to ensure the receiver is not
affected by such cases.</p><p>Control flow manifests itself in different ways, depending on whether the
network socket is blocking or non-blocking. If the receiver can process data
faster than a sender, a non-blocking socket is identical to a blocking one, and
the receiver thread would be parked while no data is read. There's not much
concern about this situation if it happens infrequently, but the park and unpark
is a waste of resources and CPU cycles if the receiver is under heavy load.</p><p>Let's assume the receiver gets 0-length data on a non-blocking socket,
indicating no data has arrived from the sender; there are two options:</p><ol><li>Loop over reads continuously, waiting for data to arrive on a socket.</li><li>Stop looping and consult our parser on two possible actions to take: park for
more reads or switch to write.</li></ol><p>The first option is quite wasteful, so we went with the second approach. To park
socket read operations without blocking the thread, we need a dedicated system
to enqueue the socket and notify us when the socket has more data to read. On
the OS kernel level, IO notification utilities exist as <code>epoll</code> on Linux,
<code>kqueue</code> on FreeBSD and OSX, and <code>select</code> on Windows. In QuestDB, we've
implemented a dispatcher that operates exactly as these IO notification systems
for enqueuing sockets, and we named it IODispatcher.</p><h2>Java NIO and garbage collection<a href="#java-nio-and-garbage-collection" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p>As you would expect from cross-platform languages, the IO Notification system
must be abstracted away to make application code portable. In Java, this
abstraction is called <code>Selector</code>. If we were to oversimplify a typical
interaction with the IO Notification system, it would essentially be a loop.
More often than not, this is an infinite loop, or rather, it executes
continuously during the server's uptime.</p><p>Since we are on a quest to have everything garbage-free, Selector presents a
problem right away - the output of the selector is a set of keys, coming from a
concurrent hash map via an iterator. All of this allocates objects on every
iteration of the loop. If you are not careful, this allocation continues even
when the server is idling. The behavior is intrinsic to the Java Non-blocking
I/O (NIO) implementation and cannot be changed.</p><p>To send or receive data from the network, Java mandates ByteBuffer instances.
When looked at in a vacuum, ByteBuffer may seem like a reasonable abstraction.
But if we look closer, it's easy to see it's a bit confused. It is a concrete
class instead of an interface, meaning that the whole NIO is stuck with the
provided implementation. The API is inconsistent as the OS requires memory
pointers for send and receive methods, but ByteBuffer does not provide an
explicit semantic for each case. So how does ByteBuffer translate to a memory
pointer?</p><p>When your data is on the heap, there is a memory copy for each socket IO. When
ByteBuffer is direct, there is no copy, but there is an issue releasing memory
and general Java paranoia about language safety.</p><div><p>Native Java socket write implementation</p></div><p>Considering the allocating nature of the Selector, that Java NIO libraries are a
layer above the OS, and how computationally expensive the overhead is with
ByteBuffer, we decided to go out on a limb and interact directly with the OS via
the Java Native Interface (JNI). This worked for QuestDB insofar as the API is
non-allocating outside of the normal bootstrap phase and lets us work with the
memory pointers directly.</p><div><p>QuestDB's JNI call for sending data to a socket</p></div><h2>QuestDB's thread model<a href="#questdbs-thread-model" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p>Starting threads is expensive, and they're more often than not just wrappers for
the connection state. QuestDB operates a fixed number of threads to isolate the
database instance to specific cores and reduce the overhead of starting and
stopping threads at runtime. The actual threads are encapsulated by a WorkerPool
class.</p><p>The worker pool's idea is to have a simple list of "jobs" that all workers will
run all the time. Jobs themselves encapsulate "piece of work" and do not have
tight loops in them. Hence a job can simply return if IO is not available or the
queue is full or empty.</p><p>We have a notion of a "synchronized job." It is different from the definition of
"synchronized" in Java in that the QuestDB's thread never blocks. However,
synchronized jobs guarantee that only one thread can execute a job instance at
any moment in time.</p><h2>Introducing QuestDB's IODispatcher<a href="#introducing-questdbs-iodispatcher" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p>IODispatcher is QuestDB's implementation of the IO Notification loop. We have
implemented <code>epoll</code>, <code>kqueue</code>, and <code>select</code>, so this works cross-platform. The
appropriate implementation is automatically chosen at runtime based on the OS.
The IODispatched API is message-driven via QuestDB's implementation of
non-blocking and non-allocating queues. These queues are outside of the scope of
this article, but you can read about them in our community
<a href="https://questdb.io/blog/2020/11/26/http-server-contribution">contribution from Alex Pelagenko</a>.</p><figure><img alt="A diagram of QuestDB's IODispatcher" height="284" src="https://questdb.io/img/blog/2020-12-10/iodispatcher-diagram.png" width="650"><figcaption>IODispatcher and queues for events, interest, and disconnections</figcaption></figure><p>IODispatcher is a synchronized job in context of QuestDB's thread model. It consumes
queues on the left and publishes to the queue on the right. IODispatcher's main
responsibility is to deliver socket handles (individual connection identifiers), that are ready for the IO to the worker
threads. Considering that socket handles are read or written to by one thread at a time the
underlying IO notification system works in ONESHOT mode. This means socket handle is
removed from the IO notification system while there is socket activity and re-introduced
back when activity tapers off. Interacting with the IO notification system
is expensive. Worker thread will only recurse back to the IODispatcher for enqueueing
if there has been zero data from the socket for the set period of time, which we call hysteresis.</p><p>You can find source code of the implementations of the IODispatcher for <a href="https://github.com/questdb/questdb/blob/master/core/src/main/java/io/questdb/network/IODispatcherLinux.java" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">epoll</a>
, <a href="https://github.com/questdb/questdb/blob/master/core/src/main/java/io/questdb/network/IODispatcherOsx.java" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">kqueue</a> and
<a href="https://github.com/questdb/questdb/blob/master/core/src/main/java/io/questdb/network/IODispatcherWindows.java" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">select</a> on GitHub. Let's take a look at the components in the diagram above with an outline of their purpose:</p><p><strong>IO Event Queue:</strong> Single publisher, multiple consumer queue. It is the
recipient of the IO events from as in epoll, kqueue, select. The events are
socket handles and the type of operation the OS has associated them with, e.g.,
read or write. The IODispatcher plays the publisher role, and any number of
worker threads are the consumers.</p><p><strong>Interest Queue:</strong> Multiple publisher, single consumer queue. Worker threads
publish socket handles and operations to this queue when IO is unavailable,
e.g., socket read or write returns zero. The IODispatcher will enqueue the
socket handle for more reads or writes as defined by the operation.</p><p><strong>Disconnect Queue:</strong> Multiple publisher, single consumer queue. Worker threads
publish socket handles to this queue destined to be disconnected from the server
and have their resources reused by other connections. The worker thread does not
disconnect the socket by itself because multiple threads may attempt to access a
data structure that is not thread-safe.</p><h3>Configuration<a href="#configuration" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p>We disregarded ByteBuffer for not being an interface, so it would only be fair
for us to have interfaces in key places. One of these places is configuration,
which provides IODispatcher with basics such as:</p><ul><li>The IP address of the network interface</li><li>Port to bind to</li><li>Bias</li><li>Buffer sizes</li><li>Network facade</li><li>Clock facade</li><li>Connection context factory</li></ul><p>It's necessary to explain bias here, which might not be so obvious. When the TCP
connection is first accepted, it is enqueued for IO right away. The bias
provides an expectation of the initial operation of a connection, such as read
or write. For example, most TCP protocols would have 'read bias', which means
that connecting clients will have to send data before the server replies
anything. You can probably think of a protocol that requires the server to
respond first before the client sends anything - in this case, the bias will be
'write'.</p><p>Network &amp; clock facades have static implementations for production runtime, but
for tests, they can be both spot-implemented to simulate OS failures and produce
stable timestamps.</p><h3>Connection Context<a href="#connection-context" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p>Connection context is a Java object that encapsulates the connection state,
which is protocol-specific. It is stored together with the socket handle and
managed by …</p></section></div>

<![CDATA[Error Handling in Kotlin Without Exceptions]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>In this article, we compare error handling methods in Kotlin; specifically: exceptions, <code>Either</code>, and <code>Result</code>.</p>
</section><article><section><p>Traditionally, we may use exceptions to handle errors. We perform some action and throw an exception if something goes wrong. But, if you are calling a function, how do you know if it can throw an exception at all? And if it does, what kind of exception? These are hard questions to answer, enter <code>Either</code>:</p>
<p><code>Either</code> can be used as a typesafe alternative for error handling. <code>Either</code> holds one of two values, a <code>Left</code> or a <code>Right</code>. When we call a function which returns an <code>Either</code>, we are forced to handle both a successful and an unsuccessful case, and get to know exactly what this function returns. On the other hand, if we were to use exceptions, there is no method signature for the developer to see what cases may occur. Developers may annotate a function with <code>@Throws</code>, but since this is optional, it is not dependable. Therefore, with lack of a complete method signature, developers must either ignore the exception or interpret the function body and all possible underlying method calls.</p>
<p>Let us say that we want to validate a user object using an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opaque_data_type"><em>opaque type</em></a>. Look at the code below. The only way to obtain an instance of <code>ValidatedUser</code> is to provide a <code>RawUser</code> with a valid email address to the static <code>validate</code> function.</p>
<div data-language="kotlin"><pre><code><span>data</span> <span>class</span> <span>RawUser</span><span>(</span>
    <span>val</span> email<span>:</span> String
<span>)</span>

<span>class</span> InvalidEmailException<span>:</span> <span>RuntimeException</span><span>(</span><span>"Invalid email"</span><span>)</span>

<span>class</span> ValidatedUser <span>private</span> <span>constructor</span><span>(</span>
    <span>val</span> email<span>:</span> String
<span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>companion</span> <span>object</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>fun</span> <span>validate</span><span>(</span>rawUser<span>:</span> RawUser<span>)</span><span>:</span> ValidatedUser <span>=</span>
            <span>if</span> <span>(</span>EMAIL_REGEX<span>.</span><span>matches</span><span>(</span>rawUser<span>.</span>email<span>)</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
                <span>ValidatedUser</span><span>(</span>rawUser<span>.</span>email<span>)</span>
            <span>}</span> <span>else</span> <span>{</span>
                <span>throw</span> <span>InvalidEmailException</span><span>(</span><span>)</span>
            <span>}</span>
    <span>}</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>And we may call it like so:</p>
<div data-language="kotlin"><pre><code><span>try</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>println</span><span>(</span>ValidatedUser<span>.</span><span>validate</span><span>(</span><span>RawUser</span><span>(</span>emailAddress<span>)</span><span>)</span><span>.</span>email<span>)</span>
<span>}</span> <span>catch</span> <span>(</span>e<span>:</span> Exception<span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>println</span><span>(</span>e<span>.</span>message<span>)</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>You may have already noticed that we catch <code>Exception</code> and not <code>InvalidEmailException</code>. This illustrates the main issue with exceptions, they are dynamically typed. The only way to know which exceptions might be thrown is to manually parse the function body (and the body of any internal function calls). This may not always be trivial, for example, if you are calling a function from an external library.</p>
<p>Luckily, there is a neat solution to this problem. Using the same <code>RawUser</code> class, we can implement it using <code>Either</code> from the <a href="https://arrow-kt.io/docs/apidocs/arrow-core-data/arrow.core/-either/">Arrow library</a>:</p>
<div data-language="kotlin"><pre><code><span>enum</span> <span>class</span> ValidationError <span>{</span>
    INVALID_EMAIL
<span>}</span>

<span>class</span> ValidatedUser <span>private</span> <span>constructor</span><span>(</span>
    <span>val</span> email<span>:</span> String
<span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>companion</span> <span>object</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>fun</span> <span>validate</span><span>(</span>rawUser<span>:</span> RawUser<span>)</span><span>:</span> Either<span>&lt;</span>ValidationError<span>,</span> ValidatedUser<span>&gt;</span> <span>=</span>
            <span>if</span> <span>(</span>EMAIL_REGEX<span>.</span><span>matches</span><span>(</span>rawUser<span>.</span>email<span>)</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
                Either<span>.</span><span>right</span><span>(</span><span>ValidatedUser</span><span>(</span>rawUser<span>.</span>email<span>)</span><span>)</span>
            <span>}</span> <span>else</span> <span>{</span>

<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>It is crystal clear what this function does from the signature alone. You either get a <code>ValidationError</code> or a <code>ValidatedUser</code>. Because <code>Either</code> is a sealed class, we also get exhaustive pattern matching using <code>when</code>. Additionally, we get smart casting which automatically gives us access to an <code>a</code> (the error) if it is a <code>Left</code>-instance, or a <code>b</code> (the success value) if it is a <code>Right</code>-instance.</p>
<p>There are cons to this approach as well as with exceptions. The choice of whether the error value is in the left or right slot is completely dependent on convention. It is easy to confuse, especially when you are working with different implementations where they are reversed (for example, <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/result/">Result</a> in Rust and <a href="https://github.com/michaelbull/kotlin-result">Kotlin-result</a>). Consider this, which of these cases prints the error?</p>
<div data-language="kotlin"><pre><code><span>when</span><span>(</span><span>val</span> validatedUser <span>=</span> ValidatedUser<span>.</span><span>validate</span><span>(</span><span>RawUser</span><span>(</span>emailAddress<span>)</span><span>)</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>is</span> Left <span>-&gt;</span> <span>println</span><span>(</span>validatedUser<span>.</span>a<span>)</span>
    <span>is</span> Right <span>-&gt;</span> <span>println</span><span>(</span>validatedUser<span>.</span>b<span>)</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p><code>Either</code> is rather generic, and thus, <code>Left</code> and <code>Right</code> may not make sense for the reader by itself. Additionally, you may also notice that <code>Left</code> and <code>Right</code> suddenly change to <code>a</code> and <code>b</code>. Not a huge problem, but readability suffers nonetheless. </p>
<p>If you want all the advantages of <code>Either</code>, but also want to stay semantically accurate in the context of error handling, check out <a href="https://github.com/michaelbull/kotlin-result"><code>Result&lt;T, E&gt;</code></a>. <code>Right</code> changes to <code>Ok</code>, and <code>Left</code> to <code>Err</code>. It makes it significantly harder to confuse <code>Left</code> and <code>Right</code> as <code>Ok</code> and <code>Err</code> makes sense in their own right (pun intended).</p>

<p>In the early summer of 2018, Norway received an unusual request from Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman's government.</p><p>Saudi Arabia wanted to send ten men on an official assignment to Norway, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs confirms to Dagbladet. The ten men were all security guards, who were deployed to work at the Saudi Arabian embassy in Norway, according to Dagbladet’s sources. But Saudi Arabia wanted the security guards to be registered as diplomats in Norway. This would give them extended room for manoeuvring in Norway.</p><p><strong>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs intervened, and the Norwegian Police Security Service (PST) has informed Iyad el-Baghdadi (43) - a Norway-based journalist, activist, and critic of the Saudi regime - about the incident. </strong></p><p>Dagbladet has asked the Saudi embassy several questions regarding this article. The embassy has responded with a press release they originally sent out last year, criticising "fabricated and false" accusations, "with the intent to insult Saudi Arabia."</p>
<p>Dagbladet has received confirmation from several sources that there were several issues regarding the ten-man security team that made the Norwegian authorities react.</p><figure data-zoomable="1">

<h2>The crucial points</h2><p>• <strong>The number:</strong> The number of security guards was unusually high. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs regularly publishes a list of all foreign diplomats accredited to Norway. According to the diplomat list from the summer of 2018, the total number of Saudi diplomats in Norway at the time was 18. Both the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the PST were surprised that the Saudis were about to almost double the number - with only security people.</p>
<p>• <strong>The status:</strong> Both the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the PST were surprised that Saudi Arabia requested that the security guards be granted diplomatic status - and registered in the official <a href="https://www.regjeringen.no/no/dep/ud/dep/forbindelser/id447053/">Diplomat List</a>. It is unusual for security people at embassies to be registered as diplomats. Both diplomats and other embassy personell - arriving on a so-called «D-visa» to Norway - is given <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diplomatic_immunity">diplomatic immunity</a>. Which, as one of several benefits, means that the host country cannot arrest you if you commit a crime. But being registered formally as a diplomat gives you a wider range of benefits.</p><p>• <strong>The increase:</strong> Norwegian authorities reacted to the fact that the major increase in security staff did not reflect what they knew regarding the activity level at the embassy.</p><p>• <strong>The key role:</strong> Officials at PST have later noted that security personnel, from the consulate in Istanbul, played key roles in the murder of the Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi, Dagbladet has learned.</p>
<p><strong>The PST declined to comment on this article, however, it has been presented with all the information herein – without finding any errors.</strong></p><figure data-zoomable="1">

<p>Guri Solberg, spokesperson at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, confirms in an e-mail to Dagbladet:</p><p>“In the summer of 2018, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs registered ten persons as new envoys at the Saudi Arabian embassy in Oslo. The status of other countries' envoys to embassies is regulated by the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations (1961) and the role of the envoy at the embassy. As these were mainly persons who were to have internal tasks at the embassy, nine of the ten persons were registered as administrative / technical personnel in accordance with normal practice. One of the ten people was registered as a diplomat based on their role and responsibilities. In practice, there is little difference in the degree of immunity and privileges granted to diplomatic, administrative, and technical personnel. The rules on immunity and privileges are dictated by international law by which Norway is bound, in particular the Vienna Convention of Diplomatic Relations, that includes immunity from criminal prosecution in the host state.”</p><figure data-zoomable="1">

<p>The men arrived in Norway at the end of July 2018. The one security guard who received the diplomatic status Saudi Arabia requested, now works as Head of Security at the Saudi Arabian embassy, according to Dagbladet's sources. He is formally listed in the Foreign Ministry's diplomatic list as an "attaché".</p><div>

<p>“It was a discussion. There are regulations for the type of status that the embassies' security people can hold whilst staying in Norway. They are not diplomats”, a source familiar with the case tells Dagbladet.</p><div id="factbox-73180109" aria-expanded="false" tabindex="1">
    <h2>Facts: Diplomatic immunity in Norway</h2>
        
    
        <p>According to the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations, all envoys from other countries have diplomatic immunity when they are working for their country’s embassy. This applies to both diplomats and administrative personnel, such as security staff. <br></p><p>However, different degrees of immunity are granted, according to the rank of the individual within the system. Only diplomats have full immunity. <br></p><p>Neither diplomats nor security staff at embassies can be prosecuted or subjected to taxation in Norway. Security staff (administrative personnel) do not, however, have immunity from civil proceedings arising from their conduct in private. Whilst diplomats can import as much as they desire tax-free for private use, administrative personnel are only exempt from customs duties on entry to a country. <br></p><p>Norway can sanction an envoy with diplomatic immunity by declaring them persona non grata in Norway.</p><p><em>Source: Ministry of Foreign Affairs</em></p>

<p>If you travel by sea to the Frognerstranda harbour, at times you can spot the Kingdom's characteristic green flag - with a white sabre, and the inscription "There is no god without Allah, and Muhammad is his prophet" - waving over the hedge. From a magnificent villa, designed in 1899 by the famed Norwegian architect Ingvar Hjorth, Saudi Arabia manages its activities in Norway.</p>
<p>Dagbladet has asked the Embassy in Oslo why they requested the security guards be granted diplomatic immunity, about the points Norway reacted to, about the Embassy’s relationship with the activist Iyad el-Baghdadi, and about why the Embassy wanted to increase the number of security guards by so many.</p><p><strong>The Embassy has declined to meet with Dagbladet, preferring to respond by email, with a press release originally sent out in 2019:</strong></p><p>"The Embassy is informed about what has been circulated in some media in regard to Mr. Iyad el-Baghdadi and the allegations against the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. The Embassy would like to clarify that this person is not a Saudi citizen and is unknown to the Kingdom. What he said is fabricated and false and aims to offend the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. We have been in contact with the Norwegian Government to provide the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia with further information in this regard. The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia reserves the right to take the necessary legal measures against the mentioned-above in order to safeguard its rights."</p>

<h2>The meeting in Oslo</h2><p>At the same time that Saudi Arabia requested that the security team were registeret as diplomats - in the spring / early summer of 2018 - el-Baghdadi and Khashoggi met in Oslo. According to Dagbladet's information, PST has not uncovered any form of physical threat to el-Baghdadi in Norway. However, Dagbladet knows that PST informed him about the Saudi security team in a meeting.</p><p>- I had a meeting with my contact in PST in January this year. They said Saudi Arabia had applied for an unusually high number of diplomatic visas - which were denied. PST did not say when it had happened, but you are now telling me that it was the summer of 2018, el-Baghdadi tells Dagbladet. He adds:</p>

December 14, 2020 | https://levpaul.com/posts/rust-lesson-11/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://levpaul.com/posts/rust-lesson-11/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody"><p>Hello and welcome to the seventh post in my series about learning Rust. In case you want to hit it from the start, <a href="https://levpaul.com/posts/rust-lesson-1/">here’s</a> a link to the first one! This entire series covers my journey from being a completely land-locked Gopher to becoming (hopefully) a hardened Rustacean, able to skitter the hazardous seabed of any application safely.</p><hr><p>This chapter covers a topic that engineers will have strong thoughts and feelings about, myself included. In college, I recall learning precisely zero about testing. This perhaps, because I studied Computer Science rather than Software Engineering? Alas, when I entered into my first real dev job it was a slightly jarring experience, figuring out how write tests for my code. In that nubile period, I can make no mistake in saying that test writing was <em>the</em> most tedious and painstaking task I can recall… (<em>Alongside waiting 2 minutes and thirty seconds for a our Java backend to compile</em>)</p><p>Mercifully, I’ve encountered many great engineers throughout my career whom took time to educate me, and I’ve grown to love testing. It once got to the point where testing was the sole driver for all code I wrote, via <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development">TDD</a>, but now has come back around to something less intense. I find unit tests less helpful and instead, lean on acceptance/integration testing to capture most things.</p><p>Ultimately how and if you write tests will depend on a few key factors;</p><h5 id="1-development-style">1. Development Style</h5><p>Are you practicing Test-Driven Developement, or are you writing in a more conventional or exploratory way? In simpler terms - are you writing your tests before you code, as you code, or after you code?</p><h5 id="2-existing-tests">2. Existing Tests</h5><p>Does the project you’re working on contain existing test infrastructure? Can you answer yes to these questions?</p><ul><li>are unit/integration tests widespread in the project already?</li><li>do existing tests contain scaffolding that enables you to easily add more tests? (i.e. mocks/stubs of major dependencies)</li><li>is the test suite run automatically via continuous integration pipelines? If so, is the pipeline passing a programmatic requirement for all pull requests?</li></ul><p>The more yeses from these questions, the more likely change requests will come with at least a couple new test cases, no matter the development style of a contributor.</p><h5 id="3-barrier-to-extension">3. Barrier to Extension</h5><p>This is simply how hard it would be to add tests had there not been existing infrastructure in place. This could be for a brand-new project or in an older project that was missing a particular type of test (i.e. no integration tests).</p><p>My experience with Java has always been bad in this respect. The testing environment was so fragmented that you had to use different frameworks depending on what style test you were wanting, and you also had to integrate said frameworks with your build framework too, just to make them run. Go was a huge breath of fresh air for me here as it had testing built in as a first class citizen from day one.</p><hr><p>With all these factors in mind, it makes sense to view testing in <em>Rust</em> purely from the third point, as this is where a language has the most potential for enablement.</p><h3 id="11-writing-automated-testshttpsdocrust-langorgbookch11-00-testinghtml">11. <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch11-00-testing.html">Writing Automated Tests</a></h3><p>Not to start on the wrong foot but straight off the bat this chapter managed to annoy me thoroughly by leading with this excerpt:</p><blockquote><p>In his 1972 essay “The Humble Programmer,” Edsger W. Dijkstra said that “Program testing can be a very effective way to show the presence of bugs, but it is hopelessly inadequate for showing their absence.” That doesn’t mean we shouldn’t try to test as much as we can!</p></blockquote><p>I scratched my head and thought, “<em>this doesn’t sound right</em>”. So off I went to read <a href="https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~EWD/transcriptions/EWD03xx/EWD340.html">The Humble Programmer</a> essay (which is fantastic). It became immediately obvious that Dijkstra had anything <em>but</em> an anti-testing sentiment. My guess is that the authors of the Rust Book may have just made a simple translation error. Take for example, the very next line of the essay. Dijkstra writes:</p><blockquote><p>The only effective way to raise the confidence level of a program significantly is to give a convincing proof of its correctness.</p></blockquote><p>No, Dijkstra isn’t talking about a formal proof. He’s talking about Test Driven Development in 1972. He continues:</p><blockquote><p>If one first asks oneself what the structure of a convincing proof would be and, having found this, then constructs a program satisfying this proof’s requirements, then these correctness concerns turn out to be a very effective heuristic guidance.</p></blockquote><p>One can only imagine the “Program testing” Dijkstra referred to in the original quote, could simply mean <em>manual testing</em> in today’s tongue. The Book missed a great opportunity to use Dijkstra to promote testing and instead we got only half of it. Oh well.</p><hr><h3 id="_setup_"><em>Setup</em></h3><p>I got a feeling that this chapter had a different author than previous ones, as the examples were numerous and verbose. I managed to skim over most of them as in essence the concepts were quite basic. Basic though, is a great quality in a testing framework.</p><h4 id="the-_basics_">The <em>Basics</em></h4><p>In no relevant order, let me talk about features of Rust testing that I loved.</p><p>First - tests are simple to add, just a <code>[#test]</code> annotation for a function and you’re off to the races. In Go you have to do two things - create a file that ends in <code>_test.go</code> <em>and then</em> write your test functions as</p><div><pre><code data-lang="go"><span>func</span> <span>TestXxx</span><span>(</span><span>t</span> <span>*</span><span>testing</span><span>.</span><span>T</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div><p>… Now let me tell you that I’ve reviewed unit tests in Go which had me scratch my head and ask myself <em>“how the f*** did these tests pass??"</em>. It turned out that after another 10 minutes of faffing about and running the tests locally, did I find the test had never been run! Along with many others in the package for the past 6 months! Why? Because someone forgot to capitalize the first letter of the test function names, meaning their <code>testMyProgramWorks</code> “tests” weren’t exported, meaning Go didn’t classify them as real tests. Add some copy-pasta and there we were…</p><p>Having a much simpler API for specifying tests is a big win in my book. Thank you, Rust.</p><h5 id="seamless-integration">Seamless Integration</h5><p>Next on my testing crushlist is Intellij+Rust-plugin testing integration. I can just hit <code>shift+F10</code> and the IDE will run the tests for my crate and spit out a summary with links to failures and stuff. For one reason or another, I never run my Go tests from Goland (Intellij for Go). I use the command line with filters to run tests in specific packages. I don’t even know if I’ve ever even <em>tried</em> to run Go tests in Goland!?</p><p>After getting excited about this, I decided to try the IDE’s debugger with an integration test. Again, it just worked! I’ve used a debugger once or twice in Go, but you have to use <a href="https://github.com/go-delve/delve">Delve</a>, then find some tutorials for setting that up with your IDE… In practice, I’ve never felt it was worth my time to use a debugger in Go. I’m not <em>sure</em> this would change with Rust - but debuggers are definitely nice to have when you’re a newbie and want to get a stronger feel for what’s happening in your code. Very cool to have it in the IDE with zero effort.</p><h5 id="almost-seamless">Almost, Seamless</h5><p>As I continued my tool-driven gorge, I hovered over a polished button that had inlaid in it, “Run ‘Hello World’ with Coverage”. Oooooh, ahhhh, I ogled.</p><p>*<strong>click</strong>*</p><p><em>BZZZZZRRP!!!!</em></p><p>Oh no.</p><p><em>Code coverage is available only with nightly toolchain.</em></p><p>Well excuuuuuse me for being so <em>basic</em> that I only use the default <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install">rustup</a> install… To reinforce this further, the Book slaps me with this one too,</p><blockquote><p>Benchmark tests are, as of this writing, only available in nightly Rust.</p></blockquote><p>I am a big fan of Go benchmarks. Possibly the most underrated aspect of the Go testing ecosystem. It’s basically the standard for figuring out how alloc-y a package is and gives you hard numbers in that respect. Maybe benchmark tests <em>aren’t</em> that good in Rust, given you have much stricter control over your allocs?</p><p>So for now, I’ll add nightly-rust to my list of things to understand, post-Book.</p><h4 id="ok-enough-tool-talk-_the-tests_">Ok enough tool talk, <em>The Tests!</em></h4><p>The Rust testing tool chain is simple and comprehensive. The <code>assert!</code> style macros are a godsend. Every test I write in Go starts with me importing the <a href="https://github.com/stretchr/testify">testify</a> library, just to get access to <code>assert</code>. Rust testing is close to what Go offers, but looks to have a clear edge, out of the box.</p><p>On the opposite end of the stick, I’m not a huge fan of coercing us to put unit tests within the module being tested. Splitting up test code from production code makes for easier reading. Thankfully, <a href="http://xion.io/post/code/rust-unit-test-placement.html">this post</a> showed me how to split your tests into a sibling module, so with some slight hacks it appears my woes are surmountable.</p><p>A point of confusion came about when the Book ended a section saying we can write tests to return <code>Result&lt;T,E&gt;</code>’s. Apparently this is an acceptable way to write tests over <code>assert!</code> macros… The Book doesn’t make a suggestion about which is more idiomatic, so until I’m convinced otherwise, I’ll stick with asserts.</p><h5 id="delight-me-more">Delight me more</h5><p>Rust continued to delight me by doing simple things that Go doesn’t, for example having sane <em>help</em> printouts for the test command. Just trying to figure anything out by running <code>go help test</code> (and yes, in that specific arg order) is an exercise in futility. Any time I have to figure out how to disable test caching in Go, it’s a visit to Uncle Google.</p><p>Simiplicity continues in Rust with sane ways to filter running tests, and a simple mechanism to arbitrarily partition your tests too, using the <code>#[ignore]</code> annotation.</p><h5 id="splitting-hairs">Splitting Hairs</h5><p>There is no logical division in Go to encourage splitting unit tests from integration tests. You have to make such a divide yourself. I love that Rust has thought deeper about this and there are patterns to follow for each case.</p><blockquote><p>There’s debate within the testing community about whether or not private functions should be tested directly, and other languages make it difficult or impossible to test private functions.</p></blockquote><p>I haven’t heard this debate before, I’m guessing it would go something along the lines of “test the contract, if that works then you’re good”. Whilst I wouldn’t buy it completely, I do find substantially more value in integration and acceptance testing than unit testing <em>every function</em>.</p><h3 id="_teardown_"><em>Teardown</em></h3><p>Both Rust and Go have testing as first class citizens, but Rust wins for ease of use and …</p></div></div>

<p>Change is hard. Explaining that change in a way that makes sense is hard. Not getting frustrated when someone is explaining change to you, or while explaining it is hard. We are all human, so please be patient. But, before you get angry, please read this. I’ve been surfing <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/centos?lang=en">Twitter</a>, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/k95dt7/centos_project_shifts_focus_to_centos_stream/">Reddit</a>, and <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25345428">HackerNews</a> threads just like many others. I’ve gathered some major buckets of complaints which seem to come up, and I’d like to address each of them.</p>
<p>Before I start, full disclosure, I work at Red Hat and I’ve been here 9.5 years. I’ve never missed a paycheck. Never. Not one time. It’s always been there on payday. That makes me happy, but just because you work somewhere doesn’t mean you check your brain at the door. I am constantly questioning what we are doing, and coming to my own conclusions. A work relationship is like any other relationship, and it must be evaluated from time to time. Like any rational human being, I do this every now and then. I’m also known for saying my mind, even when the truth is difficult to hear. I think this makes me a decent diplomat for tough conversations. That said, these are my opinions and thoughts, not Red Hat’s.</p>
<p>Let’s have a tough conversation here. There are a lot of complaints and some optimism about the <a href="https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/centos-stream-building-innovative-future-enterprise-linux">CentOS to CentOS Stream change</a>. Let’s dissect each of what I consider legitimate complaints:</p>





<h2><span id="1_This_Was_Communicated_Poorly">#1 This Was Communicated Poorly</span></h2>
<p>As I said in the introduction, messaging is hard. We are all human, even the people at Red Hat. Do I think it’s possible that this could have been communicated better? Sure. That said, I’ve seen a lot of people tossing hate toward Rich Bowen (<a href="https://blog.centos.org/2020/12/future-is-centos-stream/">CentOS Project shifts focus to CentOS Stream</a>) as well as Chris Wright (<a href="https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/centos-stream-building-innovative-future-enterprise-linux">CentOS Stream: Building an innovative future for enterprise Linux</a>) who wrote the two main pieces which communicated this change.</p>
<p>That’s not fair. These are both stand up guys. I mean seriously. I met Rich many moons ago because I had read and used his Apache docs. I went up to him and said thank you with nervousness. This guy believes in open source, more than most. He not only uses, he contributes. Big time. Same with Chris. I’ve never seen anyone who gets open source more than Chris. Seriously, when you listen to him speak you can discern how deeply he thinks about it. He is committed to it. If Red Hat ever changed their stance on open source, I am 100% sure that both of these guys would leave. There’s no conspiracy here, not with these guys. I know them both personally, and I believe in both of them. When these guys get up and say something, it’s true to the best of their knowledge at the given time. But, the world changes, and so do strategies.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Furthermore, this is a big change, and many people were involved, from both the community and from Red Hat. In fact, I’m writing this blog because I have a bias towards contribution and I believe it’s all of our responsibility to try to communicate this change effectively. Will Red Hat live and learn from this messaging? Yes, I believe so.&nbsp;</p>
<p>My only ask is, please extend some goodwill to Red Hat and see how this change goes. Give it a chance. I believe it will actually be better in the long run, and more sustainable.</p>

<h2><span id="2_Things_Changed_I_Don8217t_Like_Change">#2 Things Changed, I Don’t Like Change</span></h2>
<p>This brings me to the next most common gripe I hear. I get it it. Please try to separate your anger that is a direct result of unwanted change, from the other things discussed in this blog. Every time I’ve ever went through a re-org at work, changed roles, changed companies, bought a house, had a child or remodeled a room in my house, I’ve sort of had this “who moved my cheese” feeling. Everything was one way, now it’s another. Being annoyed by change is legitimate, but ask yourself what the benefits might be?</p>

<p><a href="http://crunchtools.com/files/2020/12/9780399144462_l.jpg"><img loading="lazy" src="http://crunchtools.com/files/2020/12/9780399144462_l.jpg" alt="" width="254" height="400"></a></p>
<p>Already, some people have proposed some benefits to this change, and I agree. I’m going to summarize the benefits I’ve seen from three different sources [1][2][3] and add some of my own thoughts:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>It makes RHEL development more transparent and reliable [1]</strong> – historically, once a RHEL release snapped from Fedora it became a black box. Red Hat tries to solve this by creating Alpha and Beta releases which we share with customers and partners. We spend a tremendous amount of time/energy/money (as a PM I have to answer bunches of questions about Alpha/Beta), but literally almost nobody uses them. It’s expensive and painful. CentOS Stream will change this. Now any CentOS Stream user will have access to and be able to participate in this process. This is amazing.</li>
<li><strong>It provides a way for ISVs and developers to contribute fixes and features [1]</strong> – Even when partners and customers would use Betas/Alphas it was difficult for them to contribute changes back. None of the branches/repositories were public. Remember, the source code at git.centos.org is basically read only, downstream code from RHEL. That’s how Red Hat complies with the GPL. Technically we go above and beyond because we are only legally required to provide code to customers, and not required to provide code for BSD/Apache/etc licensed code, only attribution. Nonetheless, this was not a community, this was a code repository. The RHEL code was more akin to Android’s read-only, versus Kubernetes’ or the Linux kernel’s read-write community. With CentOS Stream, this all changes.</li>
<li><strong>It provides a way for the community to provide feedback [1]</strong> – Partners have special people dedicated to them called partner managers, and historically these partner managers help partners provide feedback and drive changes to the RHEL repositories. Community CentOS users (and even Fedora users) never had a way to drive changes into RHEL minor releases. Fedora drives changes into major releases, but there was a black box with minor releases. This gave RHEL the perception of being insulated from the upstream community, and it was. With CentOS Stream, this all becomes transparent. It’s a noble goal, and I genuinely believe this is better.</li>
<li><strong>Moving to a rolling stream is a consequence of moving to a cloud native world [2]</strong> – this was an interesting one and I hadn’t thought about this. This is a consequence of the world of containers. I always understood the value of containers to control when you absorb updates into your application dependencies, but it also means that a rolling stream of OS updates just doesn’t matter anymore. Now that containers control when the updates occur, why even care about whether it’s a rolling stream or released with version numbers. Do a “podman build” after the minor release drops in RHEL and don’t update again until the next dot release – boom, you have something quite similar to downstream CentOS Stream. A rolling stream lets us move faster and freer.</li>
<li><strong>Don’t underestimate the value of working directly with Red Hat engineering [3]</strong> – As Neal points out, CentOS was always a community driven project. Red Hat had extended it’s brand to the CentOS brand, and perhaps mistakenly given the perception that this was a well funded project when in fact it never was. Like every community driven project I have ever seen, there are more wants and desired than time and energy. Maintenance of community driven projects is not wholly unlike non-profits where a sort of depression permeates because it feels like you are never making enough progress, and worse you feel like you’re not being appreciated by the people who benefit from the charity. CentOS stream will be directly integrated with Red Hat engineering providing a direct line to RHEL. These are people paid to do this work, in service of making RHEL better. This aligns incentives and makes it much more sustainable, but more importantly, it creates a natural communication channel between Red Hat engineering and the community which frankly never existed. This will keep RHEL engineering more in touch with the realities of user needs, and provide the community a sense of connectedness. This is a very positive move.</li>
<li><strong>Don’t underestimate the power picking up a thousand new smart, highly motivated power users with a bias towards contribution, not consumption [4]</strong> – I haven’t seen anyone highlight this value yet. There are thousands of Solutions Architects, Consultants, Engineers, Product Managers, Product and Technical Marketing Managers, and Evangelists at Red Hat. None of them had an incentive to talk about CentOS much less contribute to it. I haven’t used CentOS in 9 years because I like getting a pay check. I was annoyed when customers wanted to talk to me about CentOS. I never contributed. I didn’t hate it, but I always viewed it as a wash – it garnered users of Red Hat technology, but these users very rarely contributed. I’ve never even seen a CentOS user file a RHEL issue (aka Bugzilla) or ping me on Twitter for CRI-O, Podman, Buildah, Skopeo, or anything else I work on at Red Hat. These users weren’t even on my radar. About a month ago, I installed CentOS Stream so that our team could collaborate with a customer on some Podman development. I didn’t have to feel dirty about pointing them to a downstream rebuild. With an upstream rebuild, the feedback is all directly useful to RHEL – feature requests, bugs, etc. This is powerful.&nbsp;</li>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><section><p>The year was 1996, and it’s the 11th of November. Macarena is topping the charts, Bill Clinton wins his second presidential term, and an article in a very peculiar e-zine is published which would change the world of information security forever. The publication in question was Phrack, an e-zine for and by hackers. The article in question was Aleph One’s “Smashing the Stack for fun and profit”, thus began what many regards as the golden age of software exploitation.</p>
<p>Smashing the stack for fun and profit was the first-ever article to in detail describe the buffer overflow vulnerability. Sure, buffer overflows were already being exploited in the wild prior to the release of Aleph One paper, but it had never been documented to this extent before. A lot has happened since the golden days. We have 64 bit-systems, compiler protections, kernel protections, and so on. While the examples from the paper aren’t possible without some dangerous compiler tweaks, the essence of the stack-based buffer overflow is still the same.</p>
<h2>Buffer Overflows</h2>
<p>So, what is a buffer overflow? An easy way to explain it is to imagine a spreadsheet containing a list of items. Each item has an id, a name, and a price. Imagine has implemented a very poor system for updating the items.</p>
<p>Now, what would happen if someone entered in a bunch of A’s while updating the name? Since this terrible spreadsheet app lacks bounds checking on the name, the value of name overflows into the price field. Now the price of the third item is 9 A’s. If we think a little more creatively about this, this means that we are able to write anything we want to the price field by carefully crafting a payload, that allows us to set the price to 1. Now that would be bad for business.</p>
<p>Ok, now we know the essence of what a buffer flow is, but what about the stack?</p>
<h2>The Stack</h2>
<p>Imagine a stack of plates, you can put (push) another plate on top of the already stacked plates, and you can remove a plate (pop) from the stack. I won’t go into great detail about how it works, but what you need to know is that each program executed by the operating system has its own stack, but instead of dinner plates the stack stores stack frames. You see, every time a program calls a function, it pushes a new stack frame on the stack. This frame contains the parameters for the function, its variables, and data needed to get back to the previous frame.</p>
<h2>The Return Pointer</h2>
<p>An important part of data needed to return from the function is the return pointer. It stores the memory address for where to resume execution after a function has been called. You can think of this part of the stack frame as the price field from the spreadsheet example. If you can overwrite the return pointer, you may redirect the code flow of the program.</p>
<h2>Exploitation</h2>
<p>But how do we redirect the code flow? The classic way, as described in smashing the stack, is to use shellcode. Shellcode is raw machine code, which typically executes a command shell. The attack creates the payload, by figuring out how much input is needed in order to overflow the return pointer. This is typically done by trial and error with the aid of a debugger. Next, the attacker uses the debugger to find the location of where the shellcode will end up in memory. If the exploit is successful, it will overflow the return address with the location of the shellcode, start executing the shellcode.</p>
<p>Now a lot has happened since the 90s, and the buffer overflow like it is presented in smashing the stack for fun and profit is no longer exploitable on modern systems. However, as application hardening evolved so did the techniques for exploitation.</p>
<p>The first defense against these sorts of attacks was NX, non-executable stack. This mitigation prevents code being executed in regions of the stack meant for data. This mitigation prevents the use of shellcode on the stack, but from this a very clever trick was discovered.</p>
<h2>Return-To-Libc</h2>
<p>As I mentioned, the return pointer has to point to a valid memory address. We cannot redirect code execution to somewhere on the stack, as it is marked as non-executable. But what if we point it to somewhere that already exists? Enter the return-to-libc technique. The concept is simple, we jump to a already existing function that will allow us to get code execution. There's multiple way to do this, but the most popular is to jump to the c library function <code>system()</code>.</p>
<p>We can't jump directly into <code>system()</code>, as it needs to be called with a useful string such as <code>/bin/sh</code>. In order to pull this off, we can leverage program instructions that modify cpu registers or the stack, as long as they are followed by a return instruction. The return instruction moves the stack pointer, meaning that we can chain together multiple instructions, as it will return into the next memory address we supply on the chain. These instructions are known as gadgets. By using this technique, we can write the string <code>bin/sh</code> in the register that is used as the first function parameter (on 32-bit systems, functions parameters are pushed onto the stack instead).</p>
<h2>ROP</h2>
<p>Actually, we don't even need access to library functions at all. If we chain together enough gadgets in a clever way, we can execute directly by using a system call. This is known as return-oriented programming (ROP) and is actually Turing complete! Meaning we can make the program to behave in any way we desire. Some people have actually implemented programming languages that run on top of a vulnerable program using return-oriented programming!</p>
<h2>Stack Cookies, ASLR and PIE</h2>
<p>Further attempts were made to stop exploitation, but they only succeed at making exploitation more involved. Like stack cookies, a special numeric value placed before the return pointer. If you corrupt this value, execution will terminate. However, these can be leaked and in some cases brute-forced.</p>
<p>Next we have ASLR, or address space layout randomization. This mitigations offsets memory addresses with a random value. This can be defeated by leaking addresses in order to calculate the offset.</p>
<p>The last one we're going to cover is Position Independent Executables or PIE for short. This mitigation is used in combination with ASLR. PIE randomly shuffles each section of the program i.e., we no longer know where anything is in memory. This makes leaking a lot more complicated, but it is defeatable by getting the right memory leaks.</p></section></article></div></div>]]>

<p>Here is my personal list of legally free Python books. <strong>Warning: Packt free books are highly unreliable, what can be free today can no longer be free tomorrow They were included as they are free at the time of writing this post. Similarly is Oreilly’s case. The two publishing houses have been annotated as necessary.</strong> In case of no longer free or broken links please mail me at `arj.python at gmail dot com` to update article. I have to thank the internet who took the pain to point these resources to me. I have skimmed through the contents to producs a list of legally free Python books of value. Here’s how i evaluated books (you might not agree, but that’s my personal take on it):</p>




<p>Some popular listed books like Python Module of the Week  is not a book and Tango with Django 1.7 is outdated.  Materials which provide only some free chapters are not free books. Docs manuals are docs manuals, you’d have to include a quarter of pypi’s packages manuals then. github projects are gihub projects unless it’s a book. Mark pilgrim ran away so should we from his book. We don’t want some illegal 100+ free list (Mark Lutz books are not free mind you), you could include all Python books hosted on drive then. Python2 is past, we passed over. Fullstackpython’s list is a collection of various sites’ articles, not a book. Really short books more qualified as leaflets did not make it. Such materials have been deliberately left out. What remains are books that you’ll enjoy!</p><p>

<h3><a href="https://buildmedia.readthedocs.org/media/pdf/intermediatepythongithubio/latest/intermediatepythongithubio.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Intermediate Python</a></h3>



<p> Muhammad Yasoob Ullah Khalid </p>



<p> Python is an amazing language with a strong and friendly community of programmers. However, there is a lack of documentation on what to learn after getting the basics of Python down your throat. Through this book I aim to solve this problem. I would give you bits of information about some interesting topics which you can further explore. The topics which are discussed in this book open up your mind towards some nice corners of Python language. This book is an outcome of my desire to have something like this when I was beginning to learn Python. If you are a beginner, intermediate or even an advanced programmer there is something for you in this book. Please note that this book is not a tutorial and does not teach you Python. The topics are not explained in depth, instead only the minimum required information is given.  A true example of legally free Python books. </p>



<h3><a href="http://ralsina.gitlab.io/boxes-book/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Boxes: Your Second Python Book</a></h3>



<p>Roberto Alcina</p>



<p>This book tries to achieve only one thing: Show you a project go from&nbsp;<strong>nothing</strong>&nbsp;to&nbsp;<strong>OK</strong>. By nothing I mean, no code at all. Not even a fleshed idea of what it does. No goals, no commitments. Just a vague interest. And by OK I mean it will work, it will have tests, it will be available to use, it will be&nbsp;<strong>useful</strong>&nbsp;and be a real thing. Think of it as a sort of documentary on the beginnings of a rock band, only instead of rockers there is a single overweight Argentinian dev, and instead of a band there is a piece of software. So, not much like a documentary on the beginnings of a rock band.</p>



<h3><a href="https://learnpythonbreakpython.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Learn Python, Break Python</a></h3>



<p>Scott Grant</p>



<p>Learn Python, Break Python is a hands-on introduction to the Python programming language, written for people who have no experience with programming whatsoever. Hey, we all have to start somewhere. As such, the examples and teaching style used in this text make absolutely no expectations about your prior programming experience. Anyone can pick up the art of programming with a little time and a bit of patience. However, when learning something new, I try to break things. In fact, in many cases, I go out of my way to break stuff. When picking up a new concept like computer programming, you can actually increase your comfort level by figuring out the type of cases that are likely to break. You’ll see what data can be used and where, and when you inevitably run into errors later (like everyone does), you won’t be surprised.</p>



<h3><a href="https://www.eecs.wsu.edu/~schneidj/PyBook/swan.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Algorithmic Problem Solving with Python</a> </h3>



<p> John B. Schneider, Shira Lynn Broschat, Jess Dahmen </p>



<p>(Not an algo book) Python’s syntax and idioms are much easier to learn than those of most other full-featured languages. This book uses programming language Python to introduce folks to programming and algorithmic thinking. </p>



<h3> <a href="https://buildmedia.readthedocs.org/media/pdf/python-guide/latest/python-guide.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Hitchhiker’s Guide to Python.</a></h3>



<p>Kenneth Reitz</p>



<p> This opinionated guide exists to provide both novice and expert Python developers a best-practice handbook to the installation, configuration, and usage of Python on a daily basis. </p>



<h3><a href="https://www.slitherintopython.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Slither Into Python</a></h3>



<p> Slither into Python is an introduction to Python for complete beginners. No prior programming experience or computer science background is necessary. Unlike any other Python resources I have found (not that they’re not out there), they don’t explain important computer science concepts such as memory or “how computers work”. In this book I will cover the fundamentals of the Python language and also introduce these important concepts. Put simply,&nbsp;<em>coding</em>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<em>computer programming</em>&nbsp;is about making computers do what you want, Computer Science is about&nbsp;<em>how</em>&nbsp;computers do it. Each go hand-in-hand, help you learn faster and improve your overall understanding of a language! This book aims to do exactly that through Python. </p>



<h3><a href="https://www.oreilly.com/programming/free/files/a-whirlwind-tour-of-python.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">A Whirlwind Tour of Python</a></h3>



<p>Jake VanderPlas – Oreilly</p>



<p>The book provides a whirlwind tour of some of Python’s essential syntax and semantics, built-in data types and structures, function definitions, control flow statements, and other aspects of the language. My aim is that readers will walk away with a solid foundation from which to explore the data science stack just outlined. </p>



<h3><a href="https://pymbook.readthedocs.io/en/latest/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Python For You and Me</a></h3>



<p>Kushal Das (Core Dev)</p>



<p> A book for the total new comers into Python world. Was started as book for students before they read Python tutorial. Given it’s from a core dev, even up to chapter choice order is insightful.</p>



<h3> <a href="https://prappleizer.github.io/textbook.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Python for Astronomers </a></h3>



<p> Imad Pasha, Christopher Agostino </p>



<p> This text is designed to be an introduction to the Python programming language — which is now used nearly ubiquitously in astronomy — with applications to the types of tasks an undergraduate (or beginning graduate student) might have to tackle. It is not, in any way, meant to be comprehensive; my focus is on bringing you up to speed as efficiently and quickly as possible. This text might have useful information for those with a working knowledge of Python outside of a research setting, but is primarily designed for those with no prior programming experience. By the end of this text, I hope to have shared enough to make you feel comfortable taking the first steps into research-type problems (of which this book will contain several examples), whether in an astronomy course, a research internship, or on-campus research. </p>



<h3><a href="https://leanpub.com/intermediatepython" target="_blank" rel="noopener">OBI Intermediate Python</a></h3>



<p> Obi Ike-Nwosu </p>



<p>The python ecosystem is awash with books for beginners but few books target readers that are past the beginning stages but are not yet advanced users. The book aims to bridge that gap. The content of this book looks primarily at the various means for code organization in Python and provides user with a rigorous grounding in these. it dives into topics such as python object system, functions, decorators, metaprogramming and generators providing the reader with an in-depth knowledge of these topics that is essential for writing idiomatic and robust python code. It aims to&nbsp; provide a reader with not only a …</p></div></div>

As the founder and CEO of MicroStrategy, Saylor captured a zeitgeist when his publicly traded company announced a<a href="https://ir.microstrategy.com/news-releases/news-release-details/microstrategy-adopts-bitcoin-primary-treasury-reserve-asset" target="_blank">&nbsp;$250 million</a> bitcoin purchase in August. Since then, he has increased the company’s Bitcoin investment to<a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/cash-is-trash-so-lets-bet-425-million-on-bitcoin-11604070071" target="_blank">&nbsp;$425 million</a> and ratcheted up his<a href="https://www.btctimes.com/news/Saylor-reveals-personal-bitcoin-holdings-microstrategy-buy-more" target="_blank">&nbsp;personal holdings</a>, all while starring in relentless in GigaChad memes. After months of pestering, I finally pinned Michael Saylor down for a chat with the BTC Times.</strong></p><hr><p dir="ltr">“Stop talking about regulatory arbitrage. Censorship-resistance, privacy, and tax evasion are bad ideas. We hate that.”</p><p dir="ltr">The conversation began with a huge letdown. I had asked Michael Saylor what could motivate greater institutional investment in Bitcoin—after all, if Bitcoin is going to the moon, we’re gonna need a lot of deep pockets to climb on board.&nbsp;</p><p dir="ltr">“People with billions of dollars don’t want to invest in crypto networks that support anarchists,” Saylor explained.</p><p dir="ltr">Anything that advertises privacy and freedom from government theft becomes a direct enemy of the FBI, Interpol, and every law enforcement agency on the planet.</p><p dir="ltr">It’s understandable that wealthy investors don’t want to antagonize the State; they tend to be the government’s biggest beneficiaries. That places them fundamentally at odds with Bitcoin’s philosophical goals. Proof-of-work, block size limits, and full nodes are expensive and wasteful prerequisites to secure the network from third-party interference. Institutional investors apparently hate these things, but the growing list of<a href="https://bitcointreasuries.org/" target="_blank">&nbsp;Bitcoin Treasuries</a> suggests that we can reconcile our differences.</p><p dir="ltr">I asked Saylor if this was a marketing problem.&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p dir="ltr">It’s a matter of emphasis. The industry would benefit if we didn’t call Bitcoin a cryptocurrency, but a crypto asset.</p></blockquote><p dir="ltr">As a “currency,” Bitcoin not only competes with the Treasury and the Federal Reserve, it also implies a payment network to compete with Square, Apple Pay, Alipay, and other services that are both faster and cheaper. Maybe that’s why even the venture capitalists on Sand Hill Road still struggle with Bitcoin as a technology. They see it as either a bet on the collapse of Western Civilization, or a heavily impaired PayPal.</p><p dir="ltr">What about Bitcoin Lightning?</p><p dir="ltr">“Inspirational, but it’s not going to displace Apple or Alipay,” Saylor points out, “right now, Bitcoin’s number one source of energy is the support from Square Cash and PayPal. These are two things that directly compete with the Lightning network.”</p><p dir="ltr">This might offend the Bitcoin crowd, but it’s actually a strong endorsement. A successful “cryptocurrency” might achieve a market cap on par with Square, but beyond payments lies a $300 trillion ocean of assets. We returned to the impetus behind MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin purchase: “Every company, every organization has the same problem: How do I conserve my money? When fiat currencies are debasing, that means every single investment is probably being inflated away.”&nbsp;</p><p dir="ltr">“Bitcoin is best as a basic network that stores value,” Saylor continues. “It solves the problem for all the money and all the people on the planet.” This year’s bull market coincides with a deadly pandemic, but maybe the price run wasn’t driven by the prospect of societal collapse so much as the profligate printing of money.</p><p dir="ltr">In that case, it makes no sense to compare Bitcoin with altcoins like ETH and TRON. That’s like listing Chuck E. Cheese tokens on the Chicago Board of Trade. Bitcoin should be alongside corporate bonds, real estate investment trusts, gold, and 30-year Treasuries. The reason it’s not is because crypto exchanges don’t make money if people just buy and HODL.</p><p dir="ltr">Crypto exchanges are one of the biggest things holding back the industry: “It’s dysfunctional for the exchanges to list all the other altcoins. It is absolutely insane that they offer 100X leverage. It attracts people that have gambling addictions.” Saylor likens this to a drug dealer selling Vicodin laced with Fentanyl: “The industry can’t grow if you overdose or kill all your customers with too much leverage. It sets back the entire cause by many, many years.”&nbsp;</p><p dir="ltr">Besides, professional wealth managers don’t want to feel like they’re dropping client funds onto a roulette table. “99.9% of the money doesn't want to juggle altcoins on fire. 99.9% of the money just wants to keep their money.”</p><p dir="ltr">Eventually, Bitcoin may become the gateway through which institutional money flows to tokens and altcoins, but at this point, any attempt to supplant Bitcoin will hurt the industry as a whole.</p><p dir="ltr">The Lindy effect is real. “Integrity is by far the number one deliverable of Bitcoin,” Saylor says. “Institutional investors need reliability and longevity. You have to watch the network run for three to five years without any failure before you even begin to think you can trust it.”&nbsp;</p><p dir="ltr">Over the past decade, Bitcoin developers have been careful to emphasize the experimental nature of the technology. In fact, the latest release of Bitcoin Core is only 0.20, implying the software is still in beta.</p><p dir="ltr">To those unfamiliar with cypherpunk prudence, the abundance of caution borders on paranoia. Bitcoin satellites and fireproof hardware wallets don’t resonate with professional wealth managers. These people have a fiduciary duty to their clients and can’t joke about Citadels and civilizational collapse.</p><blockquote><p dir="ltr">Developing for edge cases hardens the network, but people like Jeff Bezos aren’t optimizing for the zombie apocalypse.&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p dir="ltr">Network resilience is crucial; the irony is that everything that makes Bitcoin robust and stable are things that would horrify a professional wealth manager. Self-custody, for instance.</p><p dir="ltr">A willingness to “Be your own bank” is a fundamental part of decentralization. But according to Saylor, no employee at an investment firm is going to accept responsibility for the corporate private keys. Even with multisignature wallets, he compares key management to handling an explosive device: “It’s like finding three of your employees and giving each one some nitroglycerin. ‘Take this home with you and bring it back in the morning. The three of you be careful, and don’t get too close to each other. And don’t drop it.’”</p><p dir="ltr">Then there are practical concerns. Saylor declined to discuss his company’s key management strategy, but pointed out that it’s not always a matter of choice. Companies exist in physical jurisdictions with accounting rules that control how crypto assets must be acquired and handled. “These considerations impact the way institutions carry the asset on their balance sheet and how it reflects it on their P&amp;L statements,” he says. For example, current<a href="https://www.aicpa.org/content/dam/aicpa/interestareas/informationtechnology/downloadabledocuments/accounting-for-and-auditing-of-digital-assets.pdf" target="_blank">&nbsp;GAAP accounting</a> rules treat cryptocurrency as an intangible asset, a classification typically reserved for illiquid things like IP and trademarks.</p><p dir="ltr">Corporate partnerships can help resolve these challenges. Bitcoiners tend to be wary of trusted third parties, but tech companies like Apple and Facebook have the ability to bring Bitcoin to the next billion users. Saylor cautions against exclusionary arrogance: “Bitcoin can become a monetary network and an instrument of economic empowerment, but the best way to do that is incrementally and pragmatically, while in harmony with the political system.” </p><p dir="ltr">It’s a catch-22. If Bitcoin is to become a sovereign money, it needs to spread to every corner of the Earth. In order to spread to every corner of the Earth, it can’t storm out of the gate screaming about crypto anarchy. Square and Paypal integrations don’t need to be the endgame, but they’ll help us get there.</p><p dir="ltr">That doesn’t mean developers shouldn’t continue to improve privacy and censorship resistance; it just needn’t feature in an investor prospectus. After all, wealth managers don’t go off about the military’s nuclear arsenal when considering a purchase of Treasury Bonds. It’s a testament to Bitcoin’s technological success that unforgeable costliness and network resilience are now taken for granted. Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic, as they say.</p><p dir="ltr">What about the cypherpunk manifesto, the one where we arise and cast off our barbed wire fences? For the die-hard crypto anarchists, institutional money may seem anathema. It’s not necessarily a bad thing, according to Saylor:</p><blockquote><p dir="ltr">If Bitcoin goes up by a factor of ten, these early HODLers are all going to be insanely rich. They can use their monetary energy to invent stuff and make the world a better place.</p></blockquote><p dir="ltr">Maybe it’s a fact of life that anything cool and subversive is eventually co-opted by corporate interests, from punk rock to cypherpunk. There’s a never-ending search for the next disruptive thing. We can either complain and rail against the inevitable, or shut up and take their money.</p><!----><!----><div><div><p><img alt="clapping image" src="https://image.btctimes.com/fit-in/200x200/e299a519b673472199379a1e21e051db.png"></p><p>13</p><p><span>+ 1</span></p></div></div><div><div itemprop="about"><p><a href="https://www.btctimes.com/author/elaine-ou"><img itemprop="image" alt="author avatar image" src="https://image.btctimes.com/fit-in/400x200/958178613b4548d1aa2b47fe39c5ab73.jpg"></a></p></div><p> Elaine is an editor at the BTC Times.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><div><div><p>Nexus is a library originally authored by <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://twitter.com/tgriesser">Tim Griesser</a> that allows developers to build code-first and type-safe GraphQL APIs. Prisma has been a core contributor to the library for over two years and has helped shape its evolution.</p><p>Today, we're happy to announce that we've released Nexus 1.0.</p><p>This release is the culmination of outstanding community feedback and contributions, years of battle-testing Nexus in production, and responding to lessons learned in creating an excellent developer experience for those building GraphQL APIs.</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> Prisma's products are no longer GraphQL-centric. You can use Prisma in a REST API, a GraphQL API, or in any other setting where you want to access a database in Node or Go. Although we contribute to Nexus, it is not necessary to use it alongside Prisma. <a href="https://www.prisma.io/">Find out more</a> about what Prisma offers and how to use it.</p><h2 id="what-is-nexus"><a href="#what-is-nexus" aria-label="what is nexus permalink"></a>What is Nexus?</h2><p>Nexus offers a way to build code-first GraphQL APIs in Node. The code-first approach to building a GraphQL API is in contrast to the (potentially more common) schema-first approach.</p><p>Most developers that are new to building GraphQL APIs start out by taking the schema-first approach that has been popularized by companies like Apollo and their Apollo Server offering.</p><p>With the schema-first approach, writing the GraphQL API requires a set of <strong>type definitions</strong> and accompanying <strong>resolvers</strong>. A simple schema-first server might look like this:</p><pre><code>type Post <span>{</span>
  <span>id</span><span>:</span> ID<span>!</span>
  <span>title</span><span>:</span> String<span>!</span>
  <span>body</span><span>:</span> String<span>!</span>
<span>}</span>
type Query <span>{</span>
  <span>posts</span><span>:</span> <span>[</span>Post<span>]</span><span>!</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre><pre><code><span>const</span> Query <span>=</span> <span>{</span>
  posts<span>:</span> <span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>[</span>
    <span>{</span>
      id<span>:</span> <span>'1'</span><span>,</span>
      title<span>:</span> <span>'My first GraphQL server'</span><span>,</span>
      body<span>:</span> <span>'How I wrote my first GraphQL server'</span><span>,</span>
    <span>}</span><span>,</span>
  <span>]</span><span>,</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre><p>While the schema-first approach is easy to get started with, it comes with some inherent drawbacks that can make development difficult when applications start getting bigger.</p><p>Nexus takes a different approach to building GraphQL APIs. Instead of keeping a separate schema and set of resolvers, with Nexus, schemas and resolvers are written in the same spot using code.</p><p>Refactoring the Post example above to Nexus would look like this:</p><pre><code><span>import</span> <span>{</span> objectType<span>,</span> queryType<span>,</span> makeSchema <span>}</span> <span>from</span> <span>'nexus'</span>

<span>const</span> Post <span>=</span> <span>objectType</span><span>(</span><span>{</span>

    t<span>.</span><span>string</span><span>(</span><span>'title'</span><span>)</span>
    t<span>.</span><span>string</span><span>(</span><span>'body'</span><span>)</span>
  <span>}</span><span>,</span>
<span>}</span><span>)</span>

<span>const</span> Query <span>=</span> <span>queryType</span><span>(</span><span>{</span>

      resolve<span>:</span> <span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>[</span>
        <span>{</span>
          id<span>:</span> <span>'1'</span><span>,</span>
          title<span>:</span> <span>'My first GraphQL server'</span><span>,</span>
          body<span>:</span> <span>'How I wrote my first GraphQL server'</span><span>,</span>
        <span>}</span><span>,</span>
      <span>]</span><span>,</span>

  types<span>:</span> <span>[</span>Post<span>,</span> Query<span>]</span><span>,</span>
<span>}</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre><p>There are numerous benefits to taking a code-first approach with Nexus, including:</p><ul><li>Schema and resolver co-location</li><li>SDL and type generation</li><li>No need for extra tooling</li></ul><h3 id="schema-and-resolver-co-location"><a href="#schema-and-resolver-co-location" aria-label="schema and resolver co location permalink"></a>Schema and Resolver Co-location</h3><p>When building a schema-first GraphQL API, it is common to start out by placing all type definitions and resolvers in a single file. When both the schema and the resolvers live next to one another, it's fairly straightforward to work in both at the same time.</p><p>As the application grows, however, it is most often desired to move parts of the schema into their own separate modules and files. It's at this point that working on a GraphQL API becomes a bit more tedious. With this modularization comes the need to switch back and forth between the Schema Definition Language and JavaScript/TypeScript to write the resolvers. Not only does one need to constantly switch between files, they also need to do a context switch mentally to work between the two langauges.</p><p>With Nexus, our schema and its resolvers are always defined together. Nexus also allows us to write everything in a common language. This allows us to side-step the co-location/context switching issue altogether and helps us to be more productive, even as our applications grow to be quite large.</p><h3 id="automatic-type-and-schema-definition-language-generation"><a href="#automatic-type-and-schema-definition-language-generation" aria-label="automatic type and schema definition language generation permalink"></a>Automatic Type and Schema Definition Language Generation</h3><p>One major benefit of using Nexus is its ability to automatically generate TypeScript types and GraphQL Schema Definition Language (SDL) files. The generated types are useful for adding extra type safety to the code used to power your GraphQL API. The generated SDL files can be used for many purposes. For example, we can configure our editors to know about the shape of our APIs to give us introspection for the queries and mutations we write.</p><p>Type and SDL generation comes for free with Nexus and can be enabled by supplying some configuration in the <code>makeSchema</code> call.</p><pre><code><span>import</span> path <span>from</span> <span>'path'</span>
<span>const</span> schema <span>=</span> <span>makeSchema</span><span>(</span><span>{</span>

Read the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/graphql-nexus/nexus/releases/tag/1.0.0">full changelog</a> and follow along below to see what's new!</p><h3 id="new-package-name"><a href="#new-package-name" aria-label="new package name permalink"></a>New Package Name</h3><p>Nexus 1.0 is now available under the <code>nexus</code> package name. All imports now come from <code>nexus</code> and not <code>@nexus/schema</code>.</p><pre><code><span>import</span> <span>{</span> makeSchema <span>}</span> <span>from</span> <span>'nexus'</span>

</code></pre><h3 id="changes-to-nullability"><a href="#changes-to-nullability" aria-label="changes to nullability permalink"></a>Changes to Nullability</h3><p>In previous versions of Nexus, fields were treated as non-nullable by default. This differed from other GraphQL API frameworks which would treat fields as nullable unless otherwise specified. The Nexus authors took this approach because allowing fields to be non-nullable by default posed some long-term risks for API development.</p><p>The default nullability for fields has now been inverted in Nexus so that we can align with GraphQL best practices and expectations, specifically from the authors of GraphQL.</p><p>At Nexus 1.0, you need to explicitly make fields non-null:</p><pre><code><span>const</span> Post <span>=</span> <span>objectType</span><span>(</span><span>{</span>
  name<span>:</span> <span>'Post'</span><span>,</span>
  <span>definition</span><span>(</span>t<span>)</span> <span>{</span>

    t<span>.</span>nonNull<span>.</span><span>string</span><span>(</span><span>'body'</span><span>)</span>
  <span>}</span><span>,</span>
<span>}</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre><p>The SDL for this type would look like this:</p><pre><code>type Post <span>{</span>
  <span>id</span><span>:</span> ID<span>!</span>
  <span>title</span><span>:</span> String<span>!</span>
  <span>body</span><span>:</span> String<span>!</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre><p>The code for the <code>Post</code> object type above uses a property called <code>nonNull</code> which offers a bit more flexibility for specifying that fields should be non-null. It's useful for situations where the chaining API is not ideal, such as expressing deeply-nested types and when programmatically creating non-nullable types.</p><pre><code><span>import</span> <span>{</span> queryType<span>,</span> stringArg<span>,</span> nonNull <span>}</span> <span>from</span> <span>'nexus'</span>

    <span>}</span><span>)</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre><p>The <code>nonNull</code> function accepts an argument which can be used to specify the type for a type or argument.</p><p>While fields are now nullable by default, it's possible to change this behavior either globally or at the type level in your Nexus API.</p><div><pre><code><span>queryType</span><span>(</span><span>{</span>

  </header>

  <p><em>This article belongs to a series of articles about caching. The code in this article can be found at <a href="https://github.com/wb14123/redis_lease">my Github repo</a>.</em></p>

<ol>
  <li><em><a href="https://www.binwang.me/2020-11-02-Use-TLA+-to-Verify-Cache-Consistency.html">Use TLA+ to Verify Cache Consistency</a>.</em></li>
  <li><em>Redis Implementation for Cache and Database Consistency. (This one)</em></li>
</ol>

<p>In the <a href="https://www.binwang.me/2020-11-02-Use-TLA+-to-Verify-Cache-Consistency.html">last article</a>, we introduced an algorithm (described in paper <a href="https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.824/papers/memcache-fb.pdf">Scaling Memcache at Facebook</a>) that can do a better job to maintain the data consistency between cache and database. We also used TLA+ to model the algorithm and verified it. In this article, we are going to implement the algorithm in real world for Redis. The implementation is very simple and doesn’t need to change Redis itself. It’s implemented it by using Redis script. However, it’s much harder to verify the correctness. In order to do it, I used <a href="https://jepsen.io/">Jepsen</a> to test it. If you look at the language analysis for the Github repo, you can see most of them are tests. The Redis script implementation, which is written in Lua, is only 5.1% of the project.</p>

<h2 id="algorithm-description">Algorithm Description</h2>

<p>We’ve described the algorithm in the previous article and even write a TLA+ model for it. But just make it easier for the readers, I’ll briefly describe the algorithm here again. Basically, whenever the client get a value from cache, it will be assigned a unique ID (lease) for the key. When the client writes back a new value, it needs to provide the  key’s newest lease ID. And delete the key will also invalidate all its leases.</p>

<h2 id="implementation">Implementation</h2>

<p>The implementation uses <a href="https://redis.io/commands/eval">Redis script</a>, which is written in Lua. It can implement multiple operations and make them atomic. In theory, this can also be done by client, but Redis script provides a consistent implementation across different clients and makes it easier to use. The algorithm is easy, so the implementation is also straight forward. The implementations are under <a href="https://github.com/wb14123/redis_lease/tree/master/scripts">scripts directory of the repo</a>. These scripts also works for Redis cluster (but I didn’t use Jepsen to test it under cluster mode). Here is an example implementation for get:</p>

<div><div>
  <div><pre><span> <a href="#n1" name="n1">1</a></span><span>local</span> <span>key</span> = <span><span>'</span><span>{</span><span>'</span></span>..KEYS[<span>1</span>]..<span><span>'</span><span>}</span><span>'</span></span>
<span> <a href="#n2" name="n2">2</a></span><span>local</span> <span>token</span> = ARGV[<span>1</span>]
<span> <a href="#n3" name="n3">3</a></span><span>local</span> <span>value</span> = redis.call(<span><span>'</span><span>get</span><span>'</span></span>, key)
<span> <a href="#n4" name="n4">4</a></span><span>if</span> <span>not</span> value <span>then</span>
<span> <a href="#n5" name="n5">5</a></span>    redis.replicate_commands()
<span> <a href="#n6" name="n6">6</a></span>    <span>local</span> <span>lease_key</span> = <span><span>'</span><span>lease:</span><span>'</span></span>..key
<span> <a href="#n7" name="n7">7</a></span>    redis.call(<span><span>'</span><span>set</span><span>'</span></span>, lease_key, token)
<span> <a href="#n8" name="n8">8</a></span>    <span>return</span> <span><span>{</span><span>false</span>, token<span>}</span></span>
<span> <a href="#n9" name="n9">9</a></span><span>else</span>
<span><strong><a href="#n10" name="n10">10</a></strong></span>    <span>return</span> <span><span>{</span>value, <span>false</span><span>}</span></span>
<span><a href="#n11" name="n11">11</a></span><span>end</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
</div>

<p>After load the script, you can use it like this:</p>

<div><div>
  <div><pre><span><a href="#n1" name="n1">1</a></span>redis-cli evalsha &lt;script_sha1&gt; 1 &lt;key&gt; &lt;uniq_id&gt;
</pre></div>
</div>
</div>

<p>It will return <code>value, nil</code> if there is value for the key, or <code>nil, lease</code> if there is no value.</p>

<p>One optimization here is, if we have value for the key, we will not store the lease. That’s because in our use case, if we can get the value, we will not get it from database and write back to the cache. This avoids a lot of memory overhead.</p>

<p>Another important decision I made is, when get the value, the client needs to provide a unique ID instead of let Redis provide one. This is because I cannot find a good way to generate unique ID in Redis cluster. In a single instance, it’s easy: just use a key and inc the value each time. You can still generate unique IDs for different keys on a cluster, but it adds a lot of memory overhead. So I decided to let clients provide it. Luckily, it’s not hard, basically every language has UUID implementation and that’s good enough.</p>

<h2 id="testing">Testing</h2>

<p>It’s easy to implement something, but very hard to make sure it’s correct. We can use TLA+ to model the algorithm and explore the state space, or use mathematical method to proof the correctness in theory. But once we implement the algorithm, it’s something different. We cannot make sure it’s exactly the same as what we’ve proofed. That’s why I find using Coq to implement, proof and generate real code is fantastic. But in this case, it’s not implemented in Coq, so we must find some other way to test it. By testing, we still cannot make sure it’s 100% correct, we can just explore as many situations as we can and make sure the system doesn’t behaves in a way we don’t expect.</p>

<p>The tool we use here is <a href="https://jepsen.io/">Jepsen</a>. It provides lots of tools to make it easy to test distributed systems. It can generate many concurrent requests, import different kinds of failures (host down, network partition, clock drift, and so on) to the system, record all the requests and responses, and check the history at the end.</p>

<p>Here is the test case I write: for each client, generate random read and write operations. For read operation, read from cache first, if the value is not found, read from database and write back to the data. For write operations, write to the database and delete the key from cache. Then after all the read and write operations, check whether the data in cache and database are the same. The test case is very simple, it implemented the way we would use the cache.</p>

<p>By providing different arguments to the test command, you can run the test case with raw Redis get/set/del operations, or use get/set/del operation implemented by the scripts. You can also import cache failure during the test.</p>

<p>If we run the test with raw Redis operations, we can find the test is failed. In the last article, we discussed that using plain get/set/del cache operations cannot guarantee cache consistency, so this is expected. If we run the test with our scripts, we can find the test passed. If we run the test with cache system failure, we can see the test failed, which is also expected from last article. The inconsistent because of cache failure can be resolved by clean up cache data after restart. But if the client is failed, it will have the same problem (I didn’t write the test case for this because it’s hard to test client failure in Jepsen), but it’s not a very good idea to cleanup cache in this case. Because client fails all the time, cleanup cache will make operations slow. The best way might be to setup an expire time so the data can be consistent after the key is expired.</p>

<p>Even though all the test result is expected, it doesn’t make sure the implementation is correct, since there are still many situation I didn’t test, like Redis cluster, network partition, database failure and so on. So welcome to add new test cases and break the system!</p>

			<p>Eight illustrations by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanis%C5%82aw_Szukalski">Stanislav Szukalski</a> from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Behold-Protong-Stanislav-Szukalski/dp/0867195193/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1198286798&amp;sr=8-1">Behold!!! The Protong</a> — a sampling of his 39 volume oeuvre on the science of Zermatism.</p>
<p>Szukalski was a polymath who, over a lifetime, developed a science that integrated singular theories in geology (cyclic deluges), anthropology (universal pictographs), linguistics (Protong, a universal first language), zoology (Yeti), anthropolitics (Yetinsyn), with many etceteras.  Common to his arguments is an overwhelming accretion of the <em>visual evidence</em>.</p>
<p>“Looking through thousands of illustrated books, I have learned how to SEE. Since childhood I have been addicted to seeing ‘pictures’ in books… I learned not only to look, but really SEE, for I did not know English yet and had to jump to CONCLUSIONS. In fact, I evolved the, to other people unnatural, instinct for UNDERSTANDING things, without knowing what they were. Looking became my life’s OBSESSION. When I am dying I will despair over the fact that I will no more be able to Look and See” (p14).</p>
<p>A sample of Szukalski’s science, on the subject of tribal flood scumlines:</p>
<p>“When the Secondary Globe (the lavaic ocean bottoms) began to submerge in the beginning of the last Farsolar Epoch, the global seas were forced to glide off the Primary (Geologic) Globe. The soil of all the lands that were re-emerging was washed off by the departing seas and the water of the globe became very muddy. In fact, Plato, after visiting Egyptian temples, learned of the chronicles that spoke of the Mediterranan Sea as ‘The Sea of Mud’. Homer’s Iliad was about Ilium (the Latin word for ancient Troy) which in Protong means ‘Mire Remembered’. The state of Illinois, U.S.A. is named after the Illinois River, and in Protong (‘Illi No J(e) Z’) actually means ‘Mire made-Born is From’.</p>
<p>“Wherever the terrified diluvial escapees shored re-emerging lands, their faces were caked with mud. And since each swam differently, each would emerge with individual muddy water ripples across the face. So when they lay there in the mud in the deadly faint, exhausted beyond words, and were found by earlier arrivees on that islet, the facial mud markings were remembered and the Flood Scumlines became the tribal markings. I have an entire volume on these Scumlines with 195 such drawings from every part of the globe” (p31).</p>
<p>Here are a few examples:</p>
<p><img src="http://images.unurthed.com/Szukalski-Rapa-Nui-head-19.jpg" alt="Rapa Nui head"></p>
<p>A head from Rapa Nui (Easter Island). “The horizontal line [the Flood Scumline] below the nose clearly shows that the ancestor swam to that island in the last Nearsolar Deluge” (p19).</p>
<p><img src="http://images.unurthed.com/Szukalski-black-lines-24.jpg" alt="black lines"></p>
<p>“In Equador and the vicinity of the Panama Canal there are Indians who paint their bodies with black lines emulating the waters in which they stood. They repeat the same lines on their faces, but the topmost of these crosses their noses, just below the eyes. This means that their diluvial ancestor buried his face under the water while swimming and made a stronger stroke with his arms when he came up to get air” (p25).</p>
<p><img src="http://images.unurthed.com/Szukalski-Eskimo-20.jpg" alt="Eskimo"></p>
<p>“This Eskimo’s diluvial ancestor swam with the nostrils under water, coming up to inhale while starting his arm strokes” (p20).</p>
<p><img src="http://images.unurthed.com/Szukalski-Polish-funerary-jar-22.jpg" alt="Polish funerary jar"></p>
<p>“One of the many funerary jars for holding the ashes of the cremated dead. This one is from prehistoric Poland… Atop the head reposes the cover in the shape of Easter Island. On their necks are many metal necklaces and, as in this one, the image vomits the salt water of the sea. These rings on the neck emulate the water ripples spreading from a drowning person. Usually, there is a large ‘spzilla’ (Polish for ‘pin’) as a Rebus for ‘Z Bi La’ [Protong], which tells us that the person cremated came ‘From Killed (by) Flood’ land and to there was returning” (p22).</p>
<p><img src="http://images.unurthed.com/Szukalski-Chiaco-flood-scumline-21.jpg" alt="Chiaco flood scumline"></p>
<p>“The Chiaco Indian tribe of Equador continue to mark their faces with the Flood Scumline on the very rim of their upper lip” (p20).</p>
<p><img src="http://images.unurthed.com/Szukalski-Etruscan-funerary-portrait-26.jpg" alt="Etruscan funerary portrait"></p>
<p>“A funerary portrait of a young man drawn from the lid of a large jar that holds the ashes of a cremated man. It was excavated in Italy and dates from the Etruscan period. On the man’s face the ancient tribal Flood Scumline was engraved, crossing his mask just below his nose, emulating a beard. However, the vertical direction of continuous lines tells us that this is really the draining water, heavy with mud.</p>
<p>“The two small circles on the chin and the edge of ripples around them made me turn the drawing upside down and there I saw that the mask resembled the Great Lioness (Easter Island), streaked with sliding-off water as if re-emerging from under the Flood” (p26).</p>
<p>An indication that contemporary Manapes also survived the Deluge:</p>
<p><img src="http://images.unurthed.com/Szukalski-Sasquatch-flood-scumline-76.jpg" alt="Sasquatch flood scumline"></p>
<p>“Among ancient carvings of the Dorset Culture of the Point Barrow region in Alaska, this mask was discovered which white men assume is an imaginary Devil. But you can plainly see that it is a portrait of a local Sasquatch. Incidentally, in the vertical lines we have a marvelous document. They were carved there to let us know that this creature, like the ancestors of the Alaskan Eskimos, also saved himself from the Deluge, for any lines, vertical or horizontal, represent ‘waters’, hence the Great Flood. There is still another pictograph, besides the vertical draining-off of muddy water. It is the horizontal line just below the nostrils which, by being placed above the water level, tell us that his breath, his SOUL, was saved” (p77).</p>
<p>“Those that saved themselves from drowning, noticed that these creatures also had the fortune to survive, so they named them accordingly, everywhere on this globe in one language, my Protong. The present name Sasquatch was then ‘Sa Z Gladz’, which means ‘Here From Destroyed’ (i.e. the deluged continent)” (p75-6).</p>

	So I decided to gamble on the opposite.
	Now I just assume I’m below average.
</p><p>
	It serves me well.
	I listen more.
	I ask a lot of questions.
	I’ve stopped thinking <a href="https://sive.rs/ss">others are stupid</a>.
	I assume most people are smarter than me.

<strong>
	To assume you’re below average is to admit you’re still learning.

	You focus on what you need to improve, not your <a href="https://sive.rs/expire">past accomplishments</a>.

	Many people are so worried about looking good that they never do anything great.
	Many people are so worried about doing something great that they never do anything at all.

	You destroy that paralysis when you think of yourself as just a student, and your current actions as just practice.

<h2 id="problem">Problem</h2><p>I got on a call with the CEO of a company that helps businesses recruit tech talents. Let's call this company TechTalentRecruitment. The perfect customer profile for TechTalentRecruitment is small and medium-sized companies that are hiring for software engineers.</p><h2 id="getting-a-list-of-small-and-medium-companies">Getting a list of small and medium companies</h2><p>The prospect has a few requirements. The prospect's ideal customer profile is:</p><ol><li>A small or medium business. Venture capital funding signals can identify such companies.</li><li>Is looking to hire software engineers.</li><li>Located in the US, Germany, and Canada</li></ol><p>We will leave item number 2 for the next step. In the meantime, I exported a list of companies that matches item 1 and item 3 with Crunchbase Pro.</p><h2 id="use-proxycurl-linkedin-api-to-filter-for-companies-that-are-hiring-software-engineers-">Use Proxycurl Linkedin API to filter for companies that are hiring software engineers.</h2><p>To use the <a href="https://nubela.co/proxycurl/docs#linkedin-jobs-listing-endpoint">Job Listings endpoint in Proxycurl's Linkedin API</a>, I need the company's search_id. You can fetch the search_id of the company using <a href="https://nubela.co/proxycurl/docs#linkedin-company-profile-endpoint">Proxycurl's Linkedin Company Profile API endpoint</a>.</p><p>For each company in the exported CSV file, I will fetch its corresponding <em>search_id</em> like this:</p><pre><code>def get_search_id(coy_url):
    api_key = 'API_KEY'
    host = 'https://nubela.co/proxycurl'
    api_endpoint = f'{host}/api/linkedin/company'
    header_dic = {'Authorization': 'Bearer ' + api_key,
                  }
    response = requests.get(api_endpoint,
                            params={'url': coy_url},
                            headers=header_dic)
    dic = response.json()
    return dic['search_id']
</code></pre>
<p>With the <code>search_id</code>, I will query for jobs posted by each company like this:</p><pre><code>def get_all_jobs(search_id):
    jobs = []
    page_no = 0
    while True:
        data = get_job_listing(search_id, page_no)
        if len(data['job']) == 0:
            break

        jobs += data['job']

        if data['next_page_no'] is not None:
            page_no = data['next_page_no']

    return jobs

  
def get_job_listing(search_id, page_no=0):
    api_key = 'API_KEY'
    host = 'https://nubela.co/proxycurl'
    api_endpoint = f'{host}/api/linkedin/company/job'
    header_dic = {'Authorization': 'Bearer ' + api_key}
    response = requests.get(api_endpoint,
                            params={'search_id': search_id,
                                    'page': page_no,
                                    },
                            headers=header_dic)
    return response.json()
</code></pre>
<p>The role of the job can be found in the response returned by the job listing endpoint. To verify that a job posted by a company is for a software engineer role, I will call <code>does_job_qualify()</code> function on it. (This function relies on a function I built that compares similar string; you can find the code for <a href="https://giki.wiki/@nubela/Software-Engineering/similar-string"><code>is_string_similar()</code> here</a>)</p><pre><code>def does_job_qualify(job):
    keywords = ['software engineer', 'backend engineer',
                'frontend engineer', 'software developer', 'software architect']
    for kw in keywords:
        if is_string_similar(kw, job['job_title']):
            return True
    return False
</code></pre><p>Putting it all together, this is how I take a list of companies exported from Crunchbase and identify companies that are hiring for software engineers</p><pre><code>def run():
    company_lis = get_company_lis()
    for idx, company_url in enumerate(company_lis):
        print(f"{idx}/{len(company_lis)}: Searching {company_url}")
        search_id = get_search_id(company_url)
        jobs = get_all_jobs(search_id)
        print(f"Found {len(jobs)} jobs")
        has_matching_jobs = list(map(does_job_qualify, jobs))
        if True in has_matching_jobs:
            print(f"SUCCESS! Adding to CSV.")
            append_valid_company(company_url)
</code></pre><h2 id="results">Results</h2><p>Out of 1000 Series A/B/C companies based in the US that I had exported from Crunchbase Pro, I found 286 companies that were actively hiring software engineers.

      <h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>

<p>Einstein has once confidently pointed out that under the assumptions of special relativity, matter, anything that has weight, cannot travel faster than constant light speed $c$.</p>



<p>In this blog post, I would like to use two mathematical approaches to show that why this is the case.</p>

<h3 id="relativistic-momentum-approach">Relativistic Momentum Approach</h3>

<p>In my previous blog <a href="https://leimao.github.io/blog/Relativistic-Momentum-Relativistic-Mass/">post</a>, I have derived the expression of relativistic momentum.</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
p &amp;= m_r v \\
&amp;= \gamma m_0 v \\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>where $\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor, $m_r$ is the relativistic mass at the velocity of $v$, and $m_0$ is the rest mass which does not change with velocity.</p><p>

\[\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}\]

</p><p>Newtonâ€™s second law states that the rate of change of momentum of a body is directly proportional to the force applied, and this change in momentum takes place in the direction of the applied force.</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
F &amp;= \frac{dp}{dt} \\
&amp;= \frac{d(m_r v)}{dt} \\
&amp;= \frac{d(\gamma m_0 v)}{dt} \\
&amp;= m_0 \frac{d(\gamma v)}{dt} \\
&amp;= m_0 \frac{d\bigg(\frac{v}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}\bigg)}{dt} \\
&amp;= m_0 \frac{d\bigg(\frac{1}{\sqrt{\frac{1}{v^2} - \frac{1}{c^2}}}\bigg)}{dt} \\
&amp;= m_0 \frac{d ( v^{-2} - c^{-2} )^{-\frac{1}{2}}}{dt} \\
&amp;= m_0 \frac{-\frac{1}{2} ( v^{-2} - c^{-2} )^{-\frac{3}{2}} (-2) v^{-3} dv}{dt} \\
&amp;= m_0 \frac{ ( v^{-2} - c^{-2} )^{-\frac{3}{2}} (v^{2})^{-\frac{3}{2}} dv}{dt} \\
&amp;= m_0 \frac{ \big( 1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2} \big)^{-\frac{3}{2}} dv}{dt} \\
&amp;= m_0 \big( 1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2} \big)^{-\frac{3}{2}}  \frac{dv}{dt} \\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>We could easily see that if we apply a constant force to matter, as the velocity $v$ of matter approaches $c$, $\big( 1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2} \big)^{-\frac{3}{2}} \rightarrow \infty$, the apparent acceleration $\frac{dv}{dt} \rightarrow 0$, meaning that the apparent acceleration becomes smaller with the constant force applied on the matter. When $v = c$, to make the matter travel faster than light, you would need to have a tiny apparent acceleration $\frac{dv}{dt}$. However, in this time, since $\big( 1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2} \big)^{-\frac{3}{2}} = \infty$, we would need to apply infinity large force $F$ to the matter, which is not plausible.</p>

<h3 id="mass-energy-equivalence-approach">Mass-Energy Equivalence Approach</h3>

<p>In my previous blog <a href="https://leimao.github.io/blog/Mass-Energy-Equivalence-Derivation/">post</a>, I have also derived the mass-energy equivalence.</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
E &amp;= m_r c^2 \\
&amp;= \gamma m_0 c^2 \\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>where $\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor, $m_r$ is the relativistic mass at the velocity of $v$, and $m_0$ is the rest mass.</p>



<p>We could easily see that as the velocity $v$ of matter approaches $c$, the Lorentz factor $\gamma \rightarrow \infty$, and the total energy of the matter $E \rightarrow \infty$. Based on the energy conservation, we would need to supply infinity energy to the matter to archive velocity $c$, which is not plausible.</p>

<p>In the fall of 2018, we noticed that there was something that set Google apart from other big tech companies. Everybody was talking about how to regulate these tech companies, and everybody had pretty good plans for how to do it — for every company besides Google. In our opinion, it was because nobody really seemed to understand what Google does, or how they do it. So, for the past two years, we’ve been researching and analyzing Google. Through this work, we’ve found some really compelling evidence about what powers Google’s monopoly, so much so that <a href="https://knuckleheads.club/2020/10/07/we-crawled-our-way-into-the-big-tech-antitrust-report/">Congress referenced this work as part of their recently released Big Tech Antitrust Report</a>. The big ideas that we have is that that crawling the web is a natural monopoly, that Google has control of that monopoly, and that once you understand why this is true and what it means it becomes pretty clear about what sorts of regulations should be taken to reign in Google’s power over the internet. </p>
<p>We have published on this website the economic arguments that we have developed that we think help people understand the foundations of Google and how to regulate<a href="https://knuckleheads.club/understanding-google/"> </a>them. Up until now we have done all this work in private, reaching out to and meeting with regulators on an individual basis. With the publishing of an article about this work in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/14/technology/how-google-dominates.html">The New York Times</a>, we are publishing this research for everyone to read and opening up the club for people to join and participate in researching Google’s monopoly. We have a <a href="https://knuckleheads.club/whats-next/" data-type="page" data-id="2518">solid plan for the next year</a> about how to finish this research and work with legislators and governments to get legislation drafted and introduced to regulate Google’s web crawling advantages. If you find yourself agreeing with what you read on this website and get caught up imagining a better future where the internet isn’t just five big tech companies all cutting deals with each other, please consider <a href="https://knuckleheads.club/join-the-club/" data-type="page" data-id="2444">joining the Knuckleheads’ Club</a> and helping us fight to win a better world. </p>
<p>So, with all that said as an introduction, let’s dive into what Google is exactly. </p>

<h3>Challenge</h3>



<p>China’s largest retailer, JD.com serves more than 300 million active customers with its e-commerce business. “A few years ago, it became apparent that as our data became more extensive, our MySQL databases became larger, resulting in declining performance and higher operations and maintenance costs,” says JD Retail Chief Architect Haifeng Liu. “We needed a solution that would enable us to easily and quickly scale MySQL, facilitate operation and maintenance, and reduce hardware and labor costs.”</p>



<h3>Solution</h3>



<p>JD chose Vitess for scalable management of large-scale database services and the support of online expansion of complex transactional data in MySQL. “We now run MySQL databases in containerized environments with Kubernetes and use Vitess for scalable cluster management and handling large volumes of complex transactional data,” says Liu.</p>



<h3>Impact</h3>



<p>With Vitess, JD has seen improvements in&nbsp;the scalability and elasticity of the database clusters. Increased resource utilization and efficiency and the automation of operation and maintenance functions have also led to reductions in labor and resource costs.</p>

<h3>China’s largest retailer and the world’s third-largest Internet company by revenue, JD.com serves more than 300 million active customers with its e-commerce business.</h3>



<p>The company also owns China’s largest e-commerce logistics infrastructure, which covers an incredible 99% of the country’s population and has achieved delivery rates of more than 90% of orders delivered same- or next-day.</p>



<p>“A few years ago, it became apparent that as our data became more extensive, our MySQL databases became larger, resulting in declining performance and higher operations and maintenance costs,” says JD Retail Chief Architect Haifeng Liu, who leads the Technological Infrastructure Department responsible for driving innovation in containerized infrastructure and developing the hyperscale, containerized, Kubernetes-based platform that powers all facets of JD’s business. “We needed a solution that would enable us to easily and quickly scale MySQL, facilitate operation and maintenance, and reduce hardware and labor costs.”</p>



<p>The company previously used JProxy, a cobar-based database middleware system for MySQL database management. After a thorough evaluation process, Liu says, “we eventually chose Vitess since it was the most suitable solution to address the biggest challenge we were facing: scalable management of large-scale database services and the support of online expansion of complex transactional data in MySQL. We now run MySQL databases in containerized environments with Kubernetes and use Vitess for scalable cluster management and handling large volumes of complex transactional data.”</p>

<p>Being a very early adopter of Vitess—and with one of the largest and most complex deployments of the technology, to boot—came with some challenges. “The re-sharding process was initially manual, the performance was poor, and the orchestrator could fail in large clusters with more than 5,000 instances,” says Liu.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To make sure that Vitess would work at JD’s scale, Liu’s team made numerous improvements and changes, including bug fixes and new functionalities and features. They have also developed performance optimization and automated management tools for the company’s JDOS Kubernetes platform. Among them:&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li>JTransfer, an online data synchronization and transmission tool that migrates data from JD’s traditional MySQL databases to the Vitess cluster in real time. All topology information in Vitess is stored in etcd.&nbsp;</li><li>BinLake, a MySQL collection tool for real-time collection of Binlog in Vitess and traditional MySQL database services, and publication of the collected Binlog to the Message Queue (JMQ) service. Integrated with Vitess, “BinLake provides intelligent and highly available binlog collection services in clusters,” says Liu. “If there is resharding or failover in Vitess, Binlake will automatically adjust the database instance of the binlog.”</li><li>Mole, a Vitess management system with a GUI console, which improves Vitess service management. “With Mole, we can easily create, reshard, monitor, and back up Vitess’s keyspaces,” says Liu.</li></ul>



<p>“Most of our improvements have been contributed back to the Vitess code base for other developers in the community to benefit from,” says Liu.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote><p>“We eventually chose Vitess since it was the most suitable solution to address the biggest challenge we were facing: scalable management of large-scale database services.”</p><cite>— HAIFENG LIU, CHIEF ARCHITECT AT JD RETAIL</cite></blockquote>



<p>With Vitess, JD has seen improvements in the scalability and elasticity of the database clusters. Increased resource utilization and efficiency and the automation of operation and maintenance functions have also led to reductions in labor and resource costs.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Additionally, “Vitess helped the team grow their technical knowledge and strength in the areas of scalable management and elastic database,” says Liu. “The fact that Vitess is a CNCF project means we can significantly benefit from working with a large number of developers and end users in the most active and fast-growing open source community. With CNCF’s endorsement, Vitess can gain increasing awareness, attract more end users and bring together developers to the project. This is very beneficial for Vitess and its end users, which is important to us.”</p>



<p>Liu and his team are excited about the future of Vitess. In addition to migrating its systems to the newly-released Vitess 3.0 (which Liu calls “a significant improvement”), they’re working on developing some common functions for the latest version and developing a more complete operations and maintenance monitoring system.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote><p>“The fact that Vitess is a CNCF project means we can significantly benefit from working with a large number of developers and end users in the most active and fast-growing open source community.”</p><cite>— HAIFENG LIU, CHIEF ARCHITECT AT JD RETAIL</cite></blockquote>



<p>For other organizations considering Vitess, Liu offers this advice: “The most value can be derived from Vitess when it is used in concert with Kubernetes. Before using Vitess, it is imperative to perform more testing and research to determine if Vitess is the right solution for your business, and to better understand what adjustments you might have to make to integrate it with your existing systems.”</p>



<p>For JD, Kubernetes, Vitess, and other cloud native technologies have been a game-changer. “Modern service platforms need to be scalable and extremely efficient and agile,” says Liu. “Cloud native technology is well-suited to handle these ever-changing environments. It offers flexibility, efficiency, scalability, independence, continuous integration and delivery for software services, all of which further enhance the quality of software services and resource efficiency. Kubernetes has become the de facto standard and cloud native is a sure thing to bet on for the future.”</p>

		<p>Well the news is out, I won’t explain the method for reasons, but our code warriors have a new fight. After requesting the SU password, they were told flat out it doesn’t exist and referred to the manual by the vendor. Taking that argument to the telco ombudsman got the same response. If there were one and you wanted to change it for security reasons, it looks like you can’t and with the vendors denying it’s existance, there’s no help coming.</p>
<p>So, the password for the SU account that doesn’t exist…</p>

<h3>Challenge</h3>



<p>Four years ago, <a href="https://squareup.com/us/en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Square</a> branched out into peer-to-peer transactions via its <a href="https://cash.app/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cash App</a>. After some steady growth, the app rocketed in popularity in 2016, reaching millions of users over just a few months. But its large monolith of a few hundred thousand lines of code was built on the assumption of one single <a href="https://www.mysql.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">MySQL</a> database and wasn’t designed to scale.</p>



<h3>Solution</h3>



<p>To solve the long-term scalability problem, they turned to <a href="https://vitess.io/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Vitess</a>, the open source database clustering system for horizontal scaling of MySQL. “The nice thing is if we solved it once, then we have a piece of infrastructure that would be the cookie-cutter way we would scale out other systems that are built the same way,” says Engineering Manager Jon Tirsen.</p>



<h3>Impact</h3>



<p>The first shard split with Vitess took place in November 2017, and “there was less than a second of downtime, so it was not user visible,” says Tirsen. Nowadays, “it’s completely routine. We did ten shard splits last week.” Looking ahead at Cash App’s continued growth, Tirsen says, “You have to keep on working on it, but Vitess does provide you essentially with near unlimited scale.</p>

<h3>For millions of people, from taxi drivers to market vendors to big businesses, <a href="https://squareup.com/us/en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Square</a> has made getting paid by credit card much easier since it launched its card reader and mobile app in 2010.</h3>



<p>Four years ago, the company branched out into peer-to-peer transactions via its <a href="https://cash.app/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cash App</a>. After some steady growth, the app rocketed in popularity in 2016, reaching millions of users over just a few months and landing at the top of the App Store’s most popular downloads.</p>



<p>The only problem? “We had a large monolith of a few hundred thousand lines of code that was built on the assumption of one single MySQL database; it was never really designed to scale from the start,” says Engineering Manager Jon Tirsen. With users increasing by the minute, the company had to dedicate more and more expensive hardware for its database. But that clearly wasn’t a long-term solution, so Tirsen’s team of three was tapped to solve the scalability problem for Cash App. “Because we had the growth trajectory, we really needed to solve it very, very quickly to step up to the challenge of the product side,” he says.</p>



<p>The team’s first pass was trying to pull data out into key value storage that they built on top of MySQL. “It’s an inherently scalable storage platform, but less feature rich,” Tirsen says. Plus, this solution would have required rewriting hundreds of thousands of lines of code and thousands of different queries, and “there was just no way we would have had the time to do it,” he says.</p>

<p>So the team proposed solving sharded MySQL themselves. At the time, addressing the problem in the application rather than in the infrastructure layer was the default way to solve scale at Square, as well as at many other companies like Facebook or Pinterest. The team had begun drawing up plans, when someone else at Square suggested they look at <a href="https://vitess.io/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Vitess</a>, the open source database clustering system for horizontal scaling of MySQL.</p>



<p>The project was still relatively new, but after Tirsen started digging into the code, he realized it would work for Cash App. Vitess met two of the team’s key requirements: infrastructure or platform layer query routing—sending queries to the right database—and online shard splitting without downtime.</p>



<p>Additionally, “the nice thing is if we solved it once, then we have a piece of infrastructure that would be the cookie-cutter way we would scale out other systems that are built the same way,” says Tirsen. “So that was kind of exciting, and it would mean that we didn’t need to completely rebuild our system. We could just make Vitess work, and the system would work. Maybe we had to change 5% of the system rather than 95% of the system.”</p>



<blockquote><p>“You have to keep on working on it, but Vitess does provide you essentially with near unlimited scale.”</p><cite>— JON TIRSEN, ENGINEERING MANAGER AT SQUARE</cite></blockquote>



<p>Tirsen’s team spent about a year making those changes, as well as adapting Vitess to work inside the overall Square infrastructure. To enable an external database to work with Vitess, the team rebuilt a lot of the shard-splitting workflows.</p>



<p>“The biggest thing we did was we changed the way sharding works,” says Tirsen. “Before, Vitess did shard splits by stopping replication, but because we can’t control our external databases, we changed that to instead use MySQL’s built-in support for consistent snapshots, where you can view the database at a fixed point in time, even if the database is still getting updated. Then you can make a copy of the database based on that consistent snapshot.”</p>



<p>That work has been upstreamed, and is now commonly used throughout the Vitess community. “It’s an amazing bonus that we can work together on solving problems across companies that don’t normally have a formal way of working together,” Tirsen says.</p>



<p>Next, the team practiced the shard splits in staging and testing environments—a lot. “You can practice the entire shard split except the last query reroute, where you basically start writing to the new shard, without affecting any production traffic at all,” says Tirsen.</p>



<blockquote><p>“While we were doing these very dramatic changes to our architecture to make it scalable, the feature teams were building incredible features on top of Cash App.”</p><cite>— JON TIRSEN, ENGINEERING MANAGER AT SQUARE</cite></blockquote>



<p>The first shard split with Vitess took place at 5 a.m. ET in November 2017, and “there was less than a second of downtime, so it was not user visible,” says Tirsen. “It was incredibly exciting.” Nowadays, he adds, “it’s completely routine. We did ten shard splits last week.”</p>



<p>Overall, Tirsen says he is proudest of this fact: “We didn’t have to completely change how developers built applications, so while we were doing these very dramatic changes to our architecture to make it scalable, the feature teams were building incredible features on top of Cash App, on top of our platform. So it was like changing the engines of the airplane while it was still in the air flying.” In fact, during that year of work, marquee features like the Cash card were launched.</p>



<p>Looking ahead at Cash App’s continued growth, Tirsen recognizes that solving the problem of scalability will always be a work in progress for his team. They’re currently building a developer platform based on <a href="https://kubernetes.io/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kubernetes</a>, <a href="https://prometheus.io/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Prometheus</a>, <a href="https://www.envoyproxy.io/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Envoy</a>, <a href="https://www.jaegertracing.io/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Jaeger</a>, and other CNCF technologies, which Tirsen envisions supporting potentially thousands of developers. “Vitess is going to become part of this essential underlying infrastructure to make sure that everything that we build becomes scalable by default,” he says. “You have to keep on working on it, but Vitess does provide you essentially with near unlimited scale.”</p>

<p>Traditionally a company opposed to gambling, and to such an extent that only a little over 2 years ago it had been willing to drop millions in support of its family-friendly cause, Disney has clearly done a one-eighty on the topic of sports betting. The motion picture and theme park entertainment giant announced on Thursday that it will be revving up its efforts to provide dedicated sports betting and fantasy sports content to ESPN+ subscribers.</p>
<p>Projecting as many as 11.5 million new subscribers, Disney clearly intends to make the most of the U.S. market for daily fantasy sports – a market currently estimated to hit nearly $50 billion by 2027. And from the perspective of a lagging-behind ESPN, who recently announced it intended letting go around three hundred employees, embracing the strong interest shown in Disney’s sports betting arm by sports bettors certainly makes sound economic sense.</p>

<h2>Sports Betting A Life Raft</h2>
<p>Disney’s intended 2021 expansion plans in overseas markets such as Hong Kong, Asia, South Korea, and Eastern Europe, will without a doubt benefit a great deal from a stronger focus on sports betting and daily fantasy sports offerings.</p>
<p>2020 was very much a mixed bag for Disney, with revenue from its theme parks and products division down 37% to $16.5 billion as a result of the shuttering of theme parks, hotels and cruises for more than half of the year. Also heavily affected was the company’s studio entertainment leg of business, with the global closure of the movie theatre industry driving the company all the way towards a 51% year-on-year plummet by the final quarter of the current year.</p>
<p>The message was suddenly clear: Disney desperately needed a life raft. And that life raft would be to make the most of the sports betting and daily fantasy sports infrastructure it already enjoys in its sports betting leverage via sports media brand ESPN and its stake in DraftKings.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Disney Makes A Strategic Move</h2>
<p>According to market analysts, Disney’s announcement regarding ESPN+ and the future carrying of dedicated sports betting and daily fantasy sports betting content is exactly what the company needs right now in order to survive and thrive.</p>
<p>Sports fans are clearly gravitating towards ESPN+, said Roundhill Investments analyst Matias Dorta of Disney’s announcement, which puts the entertainment giant in a near-perfect position to introduce millions more viewers to the exciting world of betting on sports – not to mention capitalise on those viewers in the end.</p>

This blog post is my answer.</p><p>Big O notation (example: <span><span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>O</mi><mo>(</mo><mi>n</mi><mo>)</mo><mo>)</mo></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">O(n))</annotation></semantics></math></span></span></span> is a notation used to describe the time it takes code (example: a function) to execute on a given input (example: an array of integers). A fancy term often used to describe the time it takes code to execute is "time complexity". If you come across the term "time complexity", think "The speed of the code".</p><p>Big O notation is in the form <span><span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>O</mi><mo>(</mo><mi>f</mi><mo>(</mo><mi>n</mi><mo>)</mo><mo>)</mo></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">O(f(n))</annotation></semantics></math></span></span></span>, where <span><span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>f</mi><mo>(</mo><mi>n</mi><mo>)</mo></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">f(n)</annotation></semantics></math></span></span></span> is a <em>function</em> of <span><span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>n</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">n</annotation></semantics></math></span></span></span>, meaning for every possible value of <span><span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>n</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">n</annotation></semantics></math></span></span></span>, <span><span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>f</mi><mo>(</mo><mi>n</mi><mo>)</mo></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">f(n)</annotation></semantics></math></span></span></span> outputs exactly one answer, and that answer does not change.</p><pre><code><span>function</span><span> </span><span>addOne</span><span>(</span><span>n</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>

The most common Big O notations, in ascending order of speed, are <code>O(1), O(lg n), O(n), O(n lg n), and O(n^2)</code>.</p><p>I am going to describe each of the common notations with a coding example.

			<h6><span>Knowing what software you’re running sounds like a simple challenge. </span></h6>
<p><span>The reality is very different. Modern software is often composed of a large number of independent services. Those services are themselves often built from a large number of open source libraries. Ecosystems vary, but it’s not unusual to have 1000s of individual open source libraries in use by a single application.</span></p>
<p><span>Wikipedia describes a bill of materials (or BOM) as:</span></p>
<pre><code>A list of the raw materials, sub-assemblies, intermediate assemblies, sub-components, parts, 
and the quantities of each needed to manufacture an end product.</code></pre>

<p><span>BOMs are widely used across industries, especially where complex supply chains come together in the manufacturing of goods from individual components. A software bill of materials (or SBOM) is simply the application of this idea to software systems. (A good place to start reading about this is this SecAdvent post on </span><a href="https://www.devseccon.com/security-fractals-and-the-open-source-supply-chain-secadvent-day-4/"><span>Security Fractals</span></a><span>.)</span></p>
<p><span>There are lots of use cases for SBOM, including but not limited to:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Software license compliance</span></li>
<li><span>Identifying out of date libraries</span></li>
<li><span>Finding vulnerable dependencies</span></li>
<li><span>Export restrictions and other compliance matters</span></li>
<li><span>Managing aggregate risk across a company software stack</span></li>
</ul>
<h2><span>Languages and standards</span></h2>
<p><span>For those familiar with specific languages you might be thinking “ah, like package.json” or “like pom.xml?”. There are a wide range of different package management tools with just as wide a range of different formats. These are generally slightly different to a SBOM in important ways. For instance these tools are generally about providing a good user interface for developers to define the main dependencies. The package management tools then use that information, and the state of the world (for instance what versions of that software are currently available) to determine what to install.</span></p>
<p><span>For instance in Python you might create a requirements.txt file containing a single line, like so:</span></p>
<pre><code>structlog</code></pre>
<p><span>When you install this with </span><span>pip</span><span> or other suitable Python tool it will&nbsp;</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Determine a specific version of the package</span></li>
<li><span>Determine whether the package has any dependencies</span></li>
<li><span>Determine versions for those dependent packages</span></li>
<li><span>Install all of them</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span>So on their own, package manifests don’t work well as a bill of materials.</span></p>
<p><span>Several package management tools will be able to save this more detailed information as well, describing all of the versions and maybe filesystem hashes of the required packages and dependencies. You’ll find files like </span><span>package-lock.json</span><span> or </span><span>Gemfile.lock.</span><span> Back to our Python example, you might have something like this:</span></p>
<pre><code>six==1.13.0 \
--hash=sha256:1f1b7d42e254082a9db6279deae68afb421ceba6158efa6131de7b3003ee93fd \&nbsp;  
--hash=sha256:30f610279e8b2578cab6db20741130331735c781b56053c59c4076da27f06b66structlog==19.2.0 \
--hash=sha256:6640e6690fc31d5949bc614c1a630464d3aaa625284aeb7c6e486c3010d73e12 \
--hash=sha256:4287058cf4ce1a59bc5dea290d6386d37f29a37529c9a51cdf7387e51710152</code></pre>
<p><span>While in some cases this can work for the purposes of a general bill of materials, lots of software applications or systems are composed of components written in different languages, and using different package management tools. Some of the software might also be dependent services run by others, or unpackaged. You might have some Java code, a front end in Javascript and have packaged things up as a container with a specific JDK and supporting operating system software. Lock files or similar are intended as useful implementation details of the relevant package managers more than a general purpose bill of materials.</span></p>
<p><span>What we really need is something that covers all of the various languages and domains that make up a typical application, and something that’s focused on being consumed by other tools, more than just used within that package manager or ecosystem. What we need are standards.</span></p>

			<h2><span>What is CycloneDX?</span></h2>
<p><a href="https://cyclonedx.org/"><span>CycloneDX</span></a><span> is one project that’s been working on solving this problem for a while. Originally designed as part of work on OWASP Dependency-Track, the project now operates independently, with an active group of maintainers evolving the specification as well as supporting tools.</span></p>
<p><span>CycloneDX provides schemas for both XML and for JSON, defining a format for describing simple and complex compositions of software components. Here’s a quick sample.</span></p>
<pre><code>{

<p><span>CycloneDX also has a </span><a href="https://cyclonedx.org/tool-center/"><span>wide range of tools</span></a><span> written for a variety of languages, to help with generating SBOMs from existing package management manifests or other inputs. For instance let’s look at the </span><a href="https://github.com/CycloneDX/cyclonedx-python"><span>CycloneDX Python module</span></a><span>.</span></p>
<p><span>We can use that like so:</span></p>
<pre><code>$ pip install cyclonedx-bom
$ pip freeze &gt; requirements.txt
$ cyclonedx-py -j</code></pre>

<p><span>cyclonedx-py</span><span> will read a requirements.txt file (it requires the explicit version numbers for the dependencies which </span><span>pip freeze</span><span> will add) and generate an </span><span>bom.json</span><span> file like the following:</span></p>

<p><span>You could run this as part of your CI system to ensure SBOMs are kept up-to-date, and even store individual SBOMs for each commit or each released version of your software. Similar tools exist, both from the CycloneDX project and from the wider open source community, for Ruby, Javascript, Maven, Gradle, Go, Rust and lots more.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>CycloneDX also supports various signing approaches, including XML Signatures, JSON Signature Format (JSF) and more, so you can ensure the integrity of SBOMs where non-repudiation is important.</span></p>
<p><span>Alternative formats exist too, for instance SPDX (Software Package Data Exchange) and Software Identification (SWID) Tags, and I wouldn’t be surprised to see others emerge as well. But CycloneDX’s active community and widespread tooling support makes it worth further investigation.</span></p>

<h2><span>What happens next?</span></h2>
<p><span>While a software bill of materials as an idea isn’t new, there does appear to be an increasing amount of interest in the area, with several active industry working groups working on this at present. For instance the work under the NTIA (National Telecommunications and Information Administration, part of the US Department of Commerce) on </span><a href="https://www.ntia.gov/SoftwareTransparency"><span>Software Component Transparency</span></a><span> and the work under CISQ (Consortium for Information and Software Quality) on </span><a href="https://www.it-cisq.org/software-bill-of-materials/"><span>Software Bill of Materials exchange</span></a><span>.</span></p>
<p><span>I think in 2021 we might just see wider adoption of some of these ideas and see standards drive some of that adoption into the software ecosystem. Widespread adoption here will mean not just producing lots of SBOMs but, most importantly for success, new and interesting tools that consume SBOMs and allow consumers to solve real world software supply chain problems.</span></p>

December 14, 2020 | https://sirupsen.com/shitlists/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://sirupsen.com/shitlists/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="article-content">
    

    <p>Recently the team I work with completed a project to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UyDK2bDjc4">allow Shopify to run in
multiple datacenters</a>. This project
was a refactoring project in disguise. When you undertake large refactoring of a
code-base with 100s of developers and 100,000s of lines of code, you can’t align
by sending an email. The merge-conflicts a single pull request would entail
makes me shiver. When deprecating in a large code-base the only way to reliably
avoid new deprecated behaviour is a failing test that tells you what to do.
Otherwise the pace that new deprecated code is introduced can easily outpace the
speed at which you can remove them, or be a massive source of frustration.</p>
<p>Typically deprecations come in the form of soft warnings: Logging to <code>stderr</code>,
capital letters and exclamation marks in the documentation, or a legacy prefix
to the method or class name. At the end of the day, everyone needs to get work
done, and if they see a code-path already being used from 10 places in the
code-base despite these soft warnings–it doesn’t seem crazy to introduce
another. However, if another project is blocked on these deprecated code-paths,
piling on may have a large cost.</p>
<p>To solve this problem <a href="https://twitter.com/fw1729">Florian Weingarten</a> on our
team introduced what he calls “shitlists”: a whitelist of deprecated behaviour.
Existing deprecated behaviour is OK and whitelisted. New usage of the deprecated
API is banned and fails a test with a well-defined error.</p>
<p>They come in many forms, but could look like this:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="ruby"><span>Shitlist</span> <span>=</span> <span>[</span>
  <span>ClassA</span>,
  <span>ClassB</span>,
  <span>ClassC</span>
<span>]</span>

<span>def</span> <span>push_job_that_does_crazy_things</span>(klass)
  <span>if</span> <span>Shitlist</span><span>.</span>include?(klass)
    <span># Existing deprecated behaviour is called.</span>
  <span>else</span>
    <span>raise</span> <span>Shitlist</span><span>::</span><span>Error</span>, <span>&lt;&lt;-EOS
</span><span></span><span>You</span><span>'</span>re pushing a job that does crazy things<span>.</span> <span>This</span> <span>API</span> has been 
deprecated <span>in</span> this code<span>-</span>base<span>.</span> <span>&lt;</span>team<span>&gt;</span> is actively trying to get
rid of this code<span>-</span>path, because
<span>&lt;</span>reason<span>&gt;.</span> <span>We</span> suggest you instead <span>do</span> <span>&lt;</span>alternative<span>&gt;.</span> <span>If</span> you have questions, please
ping <span>&lt;</span>team<span>&gt;.</span>
  <span>EOS</span>
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div><p>A shitlist could be something as simple as a <code>git grep</code> for a certain code-path:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="ruby"><span>test</span> <span>"no new introductions of legacy code path"</span> <span>do</span>
  actual <span>=</span> <span>`git grep some_legacy_method_with_a_unique_name`</span>
  assert_equal <span>321</span>, actual
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div><p>Other times you can reach into another API and get a count or shitlist:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="ruby"><span>RedisShitlist</span> <span>=</span> <span>[</span>
  <span>Session</span>,
  <span>FragmentCache</span>,
  <span>AuthenticationTokens</span>,
<span>]</span>

<span>test</span> <span>"no new redis models introduced"</span> <span>do</span>
  assert_equal <span>RedisShitlist</span>, <span>RedisModel</span><span>.</span>descendants
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div><p>Other ways we’ve used shitlists in the past:</p>
<ul>
<li>Make sure that a certain datastore is only read from in a certain context (or
not used at all). This would allow for using a read-only slave, or improving
resiliency in a certain area.</li>
<li>Ensure fallbacks for all uses of a secondary data-store. E.g. if you access
sessions in Redis and Redis is down, you should be able to still render the
page (i.e. have an empty session fallback).</li>
<li>Shitlisting joins between tables that have no business being joined. This is
helpful to keep data-models and scope clean, or separating a part of an
application.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you have a linter for a project, you may be able to encode rules. For example
you might use <a href="http://www.foodcritic.io/">Foodcritic</a> for Chef, or
<a href="https://github.com/bbatsov/rubocop">Rubocop</a> for Ruby.</p>
<p>Sometimes the shitlist is quite complicated, and much more domain-specific.</p>
<p>Building the shitlist gives the team responsible for it a number of advantages:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Strong feedback loop.</strong> The goal is to reduce the <code>Shitlist</code> to an empty
Array and always raise or remove the code entirely. Remove a class from the
list, fix the code and the tests, celebrate and move on.</li>
<li><strong>Stopped the bleeding.</strong> New deprecated behaviour is not introduced unless
the team is contacted or some other action defined in the error is taken.</li>
<li><strong>Success metric</strong>. If you have shitlists for everything that needs to be
done for your project, you have metrics that you can track. Every week you
can look at how these lists are shrinking. Refactoring for months at a time
can be exhausting, but if you see that you’re making progress with metrics
moving, it’s much more rewarding.</li>
<li><strong>Enforces a guarantee</strong>. For example, you can have a shitlist that all jobs
have a retry mechanism. In that case, you know that you can kill any worker
gracefully at any time since the job will retry. Because of 1-3 you know how
much work it will take to have this guarantee.</li>
</ol>
<p>It is important that the shitlist errors are actionable. If you hit the shitlist
of another team, you need to know what to do next. Ideally the error explains
exactly what you need to do, and no humans need to talk, but reaching out to the
owner of the shitlist should always be part of the shitlist.</p>
<p>If you own a shitlist, you must empathize with the problems of everyone who’s
running into problems. If you simply deprecate new behaviour and don’t offer an
alternative, you will be the source of frustration. If the value of emptying the
shitlist far outweighs the value of adding to the shitlist, it may be OK to not
offer a direct other solution but ask the person who ran into the error to
revise their solution.</p>
<p>It is important that people run into shitlists as early in development as
possible. If you run into a shitlist after spending hours implementing your
solution, you will be less than popular. Some shitlists may require an entire
re-architecting of some teams’ solutions.</p>
<p>Months, in our case more than a year, of refactoring can be overwhelming and
unrewarding work. With the strong feedback loop that shitlists introduce you can
see the light at the end of the tunnel. You know that nothing is added to the
shitlist without you knowing about it.</p>
<p>Creating shitlists in some cases can be extremely difficult. Some take hours to
create, others weeks, and in our case one took months to come up with. You’ll
have to place the cost of developing the shitlist against the cost of not having
it. In some cases logging when you hit a bad code-path may be enough (simple
soft warning deprecation) if you assert the risk of new behaviour small and the
complexity of introducing the shitlist big.</p>
<p>Delegating with shitlists is great. Due to the tight feedback loop, asking other
teams or onboarding new team members becomes much easier. Remove something on
the shitlist, fix the code and the tests, then move on. Sometimes during large
refactorings you may need other teams with more domain expertise of a certain
area of the code-base to help. The shitlist becomes a great rock to point people
at.</p>
<p>If you are about to embark on a large refactor, I highly recommend adding
shitlists to your toolbox. Your project will look much less daunting when it
goes from an opaque objective to a list of shitlists.</p>

<p>Few events are as compelling as an epidemic. When sufficiently severe, an epidemic evokes responses from every sector of society, laying bare&nbsp;social and economic fault lines and presenting politicians with fraught medical and moral choices. In the most extreme cases, an epidemic can foment a full-blown political crisis. Thus,&nbsp;Thucydides describes how the repeated visitations of plague to Athens in 430-426 BC&nbsp;provoked widespread social disorder and the breakdown of civic norms.</p>



<p>‘Men, not knowing what was to become of them, became utterly careless of everything, whether sacred or profane,’ writes Thucydides. ‘All the burial rites before in use were entirely upset and… many had recourse to the most shameless sepulchres.’</p>



<p>As the plague progresses, Thucydides describes how Athenians were swept up in a wave of hedonism and lawlessness, threatening the foundations of Athenian democracy: ‘Men now coolly ventured on what they had formerly done in a corner… fear of gods or law of man there was none to restrain them.’</p>



<p>The resulting crisis, Thucydides claimed, undermined Athenians’ faith in the rule of law and the democratic principles that underpinned the Greek city state, paving the way for the installation of a Spartan oligarchy known as the Thirty Tyrants. Even though the Spartans were later ejected, Athens never regained its confidence.</p>



<p>Covid-19 appears to have engendered a similar crisis in our world, the main difference being in scale. Whereas the crisis Thucydides describes was confined to Athens, the coronavirus pandemic has destabilized governments from Brazil to Belarus,&nbsp;not just that of a 5<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;century city-state. The political reckoning has been particularly rapid in the United States, where Donald Trump’s inability or unwillingness to check the spread of the coronavirus was a key factor in his recent election defeat. Now, the lockdowns and social distancing measures look set&nbsp;to&nbsp;plunge the world into the worst economic depression since the 1930s, raising the spectre of further political instability.</p>



<p>Given the wide-ranging&nbsp;social, economic and political impacts of Covid-19, it is natural to assume that the same must have been true of past epidemics and pandemics. But is this the case? Do pandemics really have the historical impacts that are often claimed for them or are these claims simply the product of particular narratives and readings of history? &nbsp;</p>



<p>For instance, in&nbsp;numerical terms, the most devastating pandemic of all time was the 1918-19 ‘Spanish influenza’. Coinciding with the end of the First World War, the Spanish flu is estimated to have killed between fifty to one hundred million people worldwide. However, while 1919 was the first year since records began that the death rate exceeded the birth rate, those that survived generally enjoyed longer and healthier lifespans and, in many instances, benefited from higher wages too. Moreover, while the global death toll was immense, in developed industrial countries the mortality rate averaged two percent, meaning the Spanish flu left most of society unaffected. Indeed, the Spanish flu appears to have made little impression on public memory and social institutions, hence its historiographical characterisation as the&nbsp;<a href="https://theconversation.com/why-historians-ignored-the-spanish-flu-101950" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">‘forgotten pandemic’.</a></p>



<h2 id="h-narrating-epidemic-crises">Narrating Epidemic Crises</h2>



<p>A crisis is normally conceived of as an isolated moment in time in which our lives are shattered and plunged into disorder – what the cultural anthropologist Hendrik Vigh has called&nbsp;‘a momentary malformation in the flow of things’.&nbsp;Vigh <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00141840801927509" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">observes that</a> for many people crises are ‘endemic rather than episodic’ and cannot be delineated as an aberrant moment of chaos or a period of decisive change.&nbsp;This is particularly the case for those living at the margins of society for whom crises are ever present. Indeed, social critics such as Naomi Klein argue that instability is baked into the capitalist system, hence the way that&nbsp;in the last few decades<strong>&nbsp;</strong>neoliberal societies have lurched from one financial crisis to another.</p>



<p>Nevertheless, crises have long been regarded as a way of accessing deeper historical truths. As Janet Roitman <a href="https://read.dukeupress.edu/books/book/330/Anti-Crisis" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">has argued</a> in&nbsp;<em>Anti-Crisis</em>&nbsp;(2013), a crisis ‘marks and generates history’. This is particularly the case for epidemics and pandemics which, unlike other natural disasters such as famines, are not limited to a particular region or moment in time but may come to encompass the whole globe. As the medical anthropologist Christos Lynteris <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/i40144420" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">puts it</a>, disease outbreaks involve a ‘radically different ontological order’, a mode of being that is simultaneously ‘pathological and infectious’. Or to put it another way, one could conceivably outrun a famine but those who try to flee a plague may become unwitting carriers, contaminating new communities and introducing the pathogen to new places.</p>



<p>What is also not widely appreciated is that the roots of the term ‘crisis’ lie in the Ancient Greek word&nbsp;<em>krinô</em>&nbsp;(meaning to separate, choose, cut, decide, judge) and can be traced back to Hippocrates, whose scientific method influenced Thucydides’ approach to history. For the Hippocratic school of medicine, prognosis took precedence over diagnosis, the point being to identify the turning point of a disease in order to intervene and bring about a satisfactory resolution to the illness. Similarly, Thucydides hoped that by tracking the social and moral dissolution that envelopes Athens under the strain of the plague, his history could serve as a ‘great case-book of social pathology’, enabling readers to recognise similar historical patterns in future and intervene so as to restore order and stability. In this way, <a href="https://www.waterstones.com/book/the-invention-of-medicine/robin-lane-fox/9780241277058#:~:text=Robin%20Lane%20Fox's%20remarkable%20book,that%20survive%20under%20his%20name." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">it has been argued</a>, Thucydides applied a medical template to epidemic crises that has coloured our interpretation of them ever since.</p>



<h2 id="h-the-black-death-and-demographic-change">The Black Death and demographic change</h2>



<p>Perhaps the standout example of the transformative power of disease is the fourteenth century Black Death. Caused by the plague bacillus,&nbsp;<em>Yersinia pestis</em>, the pandemic coincided with the transition from medieval to early modern European society and was greatly enhanced by new shipping networks linking Venice and Genoa with Constantinople, Tunis, London and Bruges. The larger broad-bellied ships required for these long voyages provided perfect conveyances for plague-carrying rats and were soon sparking outbreaks across Europe.</p>



<p>Some scholars claim the pandemic killed a third of Europe’s then population between 1347 and 1353; others say up to one half. Whatever the true mortality there is little doubt the Black Death represented a massive external shock to medieval society and, together with the famines that preceded it, contributed to a declining or stagnant population in Europe for almost 150 years afterwards. The result was a demographic, economic and political crisis.</p>



<p>A smaller population meant less demand for grain putting downward pressure on the price of basic foodstuffs. At the same time, a diminished population fuelled competition, exerting upward pressure on wages and challenging the villeinage system of forced labour that underpinned the feudal system. The result was a wave of popular uprisings across Europe, including the Jacquerie in France in 1358, the revolt of the Florentine&nbsp;<em>Ciompi</em>&nbsp;or wool carders in 1378-82, and the 1381 Peasants’ Revolt in England. &nbsp;</p>



<p>The demands of English peasants included the abolition of an inequitable poll tax and the removal of a statute, passed in the wake of the Black Death, that sought to restrict wages to pre-pandemic levels. The Florentine carders meanwhile demanded a more equitable fiscal policy and the right to establish guilds, fore runners of trade unions. Today, we take collective wage bargaining and trade unions for granted, but in the fourteenth century these demands threatened the basis of the feudal system, hence the observation of the French chronicler Jean Froissart that: ‘Never was any land or realm in such great danger as England at that time.’</p>



<p>This economic levelling also spurred a series of social and cultural changes, including the right of everyone except the lowliest manual worker to wear furs – a privilege that previously had been the preserve of nobles and clerics.&nbsp;In most cases the political reforms were short-lived. For instance,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.bl.uk/learning/timeline/item126561.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Wat Tyler</a>, the leader of the English rebels, marched to London to petition King Richard II with 60,000 peasants at his back. Demanding that ‘all men should be free and of one condition’, the rebels occupied the Tower of London, ransacked the palaces and mansions of wealthy Londoners, and executed the Archbishop of Canterbury and the Lord Chief Justice, as well as other hated representatives of the nobility. Within a few weeks Wat Tyler and other leaders of the revolt had been arrested and executed and the crisis was over. Nonetheless, the movement resulted in concessions to peasants: the poll tax was abandoned, and wage bargaining expanded over time, leading to the emergence of a new yeoman class.</p>



<h2 id="h-the-collapse-of-the-aztec-and-incan-empires">The collapse of the Aztec and Incan empires</h2>



<p>Similar claims&nbsp;have been made about the crisis that enveloped the Aztec and Incan empires following the Spanish Conquest of Central and South America in the early sixteenth century. In&nbsp;<em>Plagues and Peoples</em>, McNeill&nbsp;<a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Plagues-People-William-McNeill/dp/0385121229" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">argued that</a>&nbsp;‘disaster is to be expected whenever some previously remote and isolated tribe comes into contact with the outside world and there encounters a series of destructive and demoralizing epidemics.’</p>



<p>In the case of the Aztecs and Inca, the&nbsp;root cause of crisis and societal collapse&nbsp;was the introduction by Columbus and, later, the conquistador Hernan Cortez, of smallpox, measles and other Old World diseases to which Amerindian populations of modern-day Mexico, Guatemala and Peru had little or no immunity. The result was that&nbsp;within a century of Cortes’s arrival in the Gulf of Mexico in 1518 the population of Central Mexico had been reduced, according to some estimates, from 25 million to 1.5 million. A similar demographic …</p></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div href=""><p>Over the years, the articles on this blog have spanned a wide range of audiences, from fun facts (<a href="https://www.math3ma.com/blog/multiplying-non-numbers">Multiplying Non-Numbers</a>), to undergraduate level (<a href="https://www.math3ma.com/blog/the-first-isomorphism-theorem-intuitively">The First Isomorphism Theorem, Intuitively</a>), to graduate level (<a href="https://www.math3ma.com/blog/what-is-an-operad-part-1">What is an Operad?</a>), to <a href="https://www.math3ma.com/blog/language-modeling-with-reduced-densities">research level</a>. Today's article is more on the fun-fact side of things, along with—like most articles here—an eye towards <a href="https://www.math3ma.com/categories/category-theory">category theory.</a></p><p>So here's a <a href="https://twitter.com/AlgebraFact/status/1337795612583006212">fun fact</a> about greatest common divisors (GCDs) and the <strong>Fibonacci sequence </strong>$F_1,F_2,F_3,\ldots$, where $F_1=F_2=1$&nbsp;and $F_n:=F_{n-1} +&nbsp;F_{n-2}$ for $n&gt;1$. For all $n,m\geq 1$,</p><figure id="w-node-56ded0a0ed9d-24b29fc4"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5b1d427ae0c922e912eda447/5fd6b348cd57457fe072fa24_fact.jpeg" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>In words, the greatest common divisor of the $n$th and $m$th Fibonacci numbers is the Fibonacci number whose index is the greatest common divisor of $n$ and $m$. (<a href="https://www.cut-the-knot.org/arithmetic/algebra/FibonacciGCD.shtml">Here's</a> a proof.) Upon seeing this, your "spidey senses" might be tingling.&nbsp;<em>Surely</em>&nbsp;there's some structure-preserving map $F$ lurking in the background, and this identity means it has a certain nice property. But what <em>is</em> that map?&nbsp;And what structure does it preserve?&nbsp;And what's the formal way to describe the nice property it has?</p><p>The short answer is that the natural numbers $\mathbb{N}=\{1,2,3,\ldots\}$ form a partially ordered set (poset) under division, and the function $F\colon \mathbb{N}\to\mathbb{N}$ defined by $n\mapsto F_n:=F(n)$ preserves <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Join_and_meet"><em>meets</em></a>:&nbsp;$F_n\wedge F_m = F(n\wedge m)$. When viewing $\mathbb{N}$ from this perspective, the meet of two natural numbers is precisely their GCD:&nbsp;$n\wedge m = \text{gcd}(n,m).$ Now, a poset in which every nonempty finite subset has a meet is called a <strong>meet-semilattice</strong>, and the natural numbers are an example.&nbsp;You can always find the GCD of a finite subset of natural numbers. And a meet-preserving function between meet-semilattices, such as our $F$ above, is called a <strong>meet-semilattice homomorphism.</strong></p><p><strong>‍</strong>Short and sweet.</p><p>But posets, meets, and meet-semilattice homomorphisms can <em>all</em> be re-expressed in the language of category theory: posets are <a href="https://www.math3ma.com/blog/what-is-a-category">categories</a>; meets are <a href="https://www.math3ma.com/blog/limits-and-colimits-part-1">categorical limits</a>, and meet-semilattice homomorphisms are <a href="https://www.math3ma.com/blog/what-is-a-functor-part-1">functors</a> with a nice property. This shift in perspective is a bit overkill, but it's fun to think about!</p><figure id="w-node-83b339d115dd-24b29fc4"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5b1d427ae0c922e912eda447/5fd6992bd4f3f5a0c9ce007a_examples_of.jpeg" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>In particular, the category of natural numbers that we'll define below is one of my favorite introductory examples. What's more, unwinding these ideas will take us through a tour of basic ideas discussed previously on the blog—<a href="https://www.math3ma.com/blog/what-is-a-category">categories</a>, <a href="https://www.math3ma.com/blog/what-is-a-functor-part-1">functors</a>, and <a href="https://www.math3ma.com/blog/limits-and-colimits-part-1">categorical limits</a>—which may be helpful for anyone learning the subject.</p><p>So let's begin! I want to show you how the natural numbers form a category with a nice property: it has all limits. Moreover, the identity $\text{gcd}(F_n,F_m)=F_{\text{gcd}(n,m)}$ is another way of saying our Fibonacci function $F\colon \mathbb{N}\to\mathbb{N}$ is a functor that preserves limits, which is to say it's a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limit_(category_theory)#Preservation_of_limits">continuous functor</a>. </p><p>Let's go through these claims one-by-one.</p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5b1d427ae0c922e912eda447/5b527d2844acede360b8e7ae_hline.jpg" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><h2>The natural numbers $\mathbb{N}$ are a <strong>category</strong>.</h2><p>Consider a category whose objects are natural numbers $\mathbb{N}=\{1,2,3,\ldots\}$ and whose morphisms&nbsp;are given by divisibility.&nbsp;That is, given two natural numbers $n$ and $m$, there is a morphism $n\to m$ if and only if $n$ evenly divides $m$. I've drawn a few objects and (nonidentity) morphisms below, but there are infinitely many more.</p><figure id="w-node-9f1be0914bfc-24b29fc4"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5b1d427ae0c922e912eda447/5fd6bb281ece2a16f5e175e5_divide.jpeg" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>It's quick to check this does indeed define a category: there's an identity morphism $n\to n$ for each $n\in \mathbb{N}$ since $n$ divides evenly into itself, and composition of morphisms $n\to m\to p$ follows from transitivity of divisibility.</p><p>In fact, looking under the hood, divisibility defines a <strong>partial order</strong> on the set $\mathbb{N}$; that is, it's a reflexive, antisymmetric, and transitive relation. Equipped with this partial, the set $\mathbb{N}$&nbsp;is a <strong>poset</strong>. Alternatively, as we've just shown, we can also view $\mathbb{N}$ as category: the identity morphisms $n\to n$ are provided by reflexivity $n\mid n$, and composition $n\to m\to p$ is provided by transitivity. In fact, this is a very simple category: there is <em>at most</em> <em>one</em> morphism between any two objects. Every poset viewed as a category has this property. </p><p>In what follows, let's be flexible when thinking of $\mathbb{N}$ as a poset or a category—moving between the two is simply a change in perspective.</p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5b1d427ae0c922e912eda447/5b527d2844acede360b8e7ae_hline.jpg" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><h2>The category $\mathbb{N}$ has all <strong>limits</strong>, given by the GCD.</h2><p>As we <a href="https://www.math3ma.com/blog/limits-and-colimits-part-1">discussed long ago</a>, limits and colimits in category theory are a (and in some sense <em>the</em>) most efficient way of constructing new mathematical objects from old.</p><figure id="w-node-23fb8181ac1e-24b29fc4"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5b1d427ae0c922e912eda447/5b5910cb0bfb3cc32a29cbae_one.jpg" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>For instance, given a bunch of natural numbers, how might we combine them to get a <em>new </em>number?&nbsp;There are lots of possibilities: we could add them, subtract them, multiply them, divide them, compute their GCD, and so on. The last option is decidedly different from the rest because it satisfies something called a <em>universal property.</em></p><p>We won't get into the details, but recall that the GCD of $n$ and $m$ is their meet<em> </em>in the poset $\mathbb{N}$.&nbsp;So not only is the GCD <em>a</em> lower bound on $n$&nbsp;and $m$, it's the larg<em>est</em> of all lower bounds. The "est" here is what clues us in to a universal property lying in the background. Indeed, in the eyes of category theory, $\text{gcd}(n,m)$ is called the categorical<strong> product </strong>of $n$ and $m$, which is a general construction that appears all across the mathematical landscape. Other <a href="https://www.math3ma.com/blog/limits-and-colimits-part-3">examples</a> of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Product_(category_theory)">products</a> include, meets in general posets, the Cartesian product of sets $X\times Y$, the direct sum of finite-dimensional vector spaces $V\oplus W$, the Cartesian product of topological spaces (hello <a href="https://www.math3ma.com/blog/multiplying-non-numbers">Multiplying Non-Numbers!</a>), and lots more.</p><p>In fact, not only is $\text{gcd}(n,m)$ the product of $n$ and $m$, it's also their <strong>pullback</strong>, their <strong>inverse limit</strong>, and their <strong>equalizer</strong>!&nbsp;These are all examples of more general constructions called categorical <a href="https://www.math3ma.com/blog/limits-and-colimits-part-2"><em>limits</em></a>. In a poset viewed as a category, these different constructions all happen to coincide&nbsp;with each other. In particular, in our category $\mathbb{N}$, all of these lofty terms simply become the GCD. We've discussed this in detail <a href="https://www.math3ma.com/blog/limits-and-colimits-part-3">before</a>. </p><figure id="w-node-311666b6bd58-24b29fc4"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5b1d427ae0c922e912eda447/5fd6a166db239146ff9ebb68_gcd.jpeg" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>Now, recall that the poset $\mathbb{N}$ is a <em>meet-semilattice</em>, which is the name given to posets in which the meet of every nonempty finite subset exists. Not surprisingly, this concept has a generalization in category theory.&nbsp;There, <em>meets</em> are replaced by <em>limits</em>, and a category in which the limit of every collection of objects (called a <a href="https://www.math3ma.com/blog/a-diagram-is-a-functor">diagram</a>, more formally) exists is called a <strong>complete category</strong>. So every meet-semilattice such as $\mathbb{N}$ is an example of a complete category.</p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5b1d427ae0c922e912eda447/5b527d2844acede360b8e7ae_hline.jpg" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><h2>The Fibonacci sequence is a <strong>functor</strong>.</h2><p>Let's now recall the function $F\colon\mathbb{N}\to\mathbb{N}$ defined by&nbsp;assigning to each natural number $n$ the $n$th Fibonacci number, $F(n):=F_n$. When viewing $\mathbb{N}$ as a category, $F$ is a functor. This follows from the fact that $$n\mid m \quad\text{implies}\quad F_n\mid F_m$$ for all $n,m\geq 1$ or equivalently, that for each $n\geq 1$, one has $F_{n}\mid F_{nk}$ for all $k\in\mathbb{N}$, which can be <a href="https://www.cut-the-knot.org/arithmetic/algebra/FibonacciMatrix.shtml#proposition">proved</a> by induction on $n$. To see this, know that a functor between categories is an assignment on objects (that's the $n\mapsto F_n$ part) <em>and </em>on morphisms. The latter means for every morphism $n\to m$ we need a morphism $F_n\to F_m$. But that's precisely the divisibility implication above. Reflexivity and transitivity of division further guaratee that $F$ preserves identity morphisms as well as composition.</p><p>More generally, functors between posets viewed as categories are precisely order-preserving functions.</p><figure id="w-node-85174c59c192-24b29fc4"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5b1d427ae0c922e912eda447/5fd6a63b97fda235de3c6ea6_functor.jpeg" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>And now we're ready for the punchline!</p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5b1d427ae0c922e912eda447/5b527d2844acede360b8e7ae_hline.jpg" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><h2>This functor is <strong>continuous</strong>.</h2><p>In category theory, a functor between categories $F\colon\mathsf{C}\to\mathsf{D}$ is called <strong>continuous</strong> if it preserves limits. Said more formally, one starts with something called a <a href="https://www.math3ma.com/blog/a-diagram-is-a-functor">diagram</a> $X$ in $\mathsf{C}$, as mentioned earlier. Then one computes the limit $\text{lim}&nbsp;X$ of that diagram in $\mathsf{C}$, if it exists, and one says $F$&nbsp;is <em>continuous</em> if there is an isomorphism $F(\text{lim}&nbsp;X)\cong \lim&nbsp;(FX)$. </p><p>It turns out that when both categories $\mathsf{C}$&nbsp;and $\mathsf{D}$ are meet-semilattices, a continuous functor between them reduces to something simple:&nbsp;a <strong>meet-semilattice homomorphism</strong>. In our case, that amounts to a function $F\colon \mathbb{N}\to\mathbb{N}$ that satisfies the following properties for all $n,m\geq 1$:</p><ol start="" role="list"><li>[$F$ is a functor] It's compatible with the partial order: $n\mid m$ implies $F(n)\mid F(m)$.</li><li>[$F$ preserves limits.] It preserves meets; that is, there is an equality $F(n\wedge m) = F(n)\wedge F(m).$</li></ol><p>And as we noted earlier, meets $\wedge$ in $\mathbb{N}$ are greatest common divisors!&nbsp;Thus, taking $F$ to be the Fibonacci sequence $n\mapsto F_n$, the equality in item (2)&nbsp;brings us back to where we started: $F(n\wedge m) = F(n) \wedge F(m)$ is precisely the condition that $F_{\text{gcd}(n,m)}= \text{gcd}(F_n,F_m)$. <em> </em></p><figure id="w-node-c73f759f1104-24b29fc4"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5b1d427ae0c922e912eda447/5fd6a8ea603e1d854aab451f_final.jpeg" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p><em>Et voila!</em></p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5b1d427ae0c922e912eda447/5b527d2844acede360b8e7ae_hline.jpg" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>To summarize, the Fibonacci sequence $n\mapsto F_n$ can be thought of as a continuous functor from the complete category $\mathbb{N}$ to itself. More simply, it's a meet-semilattice homomorphism between the natural numbers when viewed as a poset under divisibility. </p><p>Now, I'll be the first to admit—the categorical language is a bit overloaded for such a simple idea. But it's fun to peak into the world of abstraction, and see how familiar things are special cases of something much more general! And by the way, there's nothing too special about the Fibonacci numbers here—any <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divisibility_sequence">strong divisibility sequence</a>&nbsp;can be recast in this way!</p></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>  <p><span>14 Dec 2020</span></p><p>This article provides practical tips on how to optimize the loading speed of your website. Some advice specifically aims at users of <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>, the blog-enabled static site generator. However, the basic ideas also apply to other tools and should therefore be easy to transfer.</p> <p>Note: This is an article written by and for the occasional web developer. If you’re a professional full-time web developer, you might know much of the content. I still encourage you to continue reading, though!</p> <h2 id="why-care">Why Care?</h2> <p>Why should you care about performance? We’ve got tiny supercomputers in our pockets, so who cares? And aren’t static websites such as those generated by <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> super fast out of the box? Well, not so fast.</p> <p>Performance matters a lot, and tiny improvements can make a vast difference. According to research from Google, the speed it takes to load a page has an impact of around 75% for user experience, clearly above other criteria such as ease of use or attractiveness:</p> <p><img src="https://www.danielsieger.com/images/speed_impact.jpg" alt="Impact of Speed on UX"></p> <p>If you would like to learn more, have a look at this talk from Google’s 2019 I/O conference:</p> <p> <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mLjxXPHuIJo" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p> <p>When it comes to static websites the situation surely is not as bad as in other cases. Remember Flash, anyone? However, investigating performance more closely reveals opportunities for optimization even for static sites.</p> <h2 id="performance-analysis">Performance Analysis</h2> <p>First, we need to measure performance before we can optimize it. My current tool of choice is Google’s <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse">Lighthouse</a>. You can either run it in a browser through <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools">Chrome Dev Tools</a> or online at Google’s <a href="https://web.dev/measure">web.dev</a> pages.</p> <p>Lighthouse not only analyzes raw performance but also provides insight into how well your website performs according to</p> <ul> <li>Accessibility</li> <li>Best practices</li> <li>Search engine optimization</li> </ul> <p>Here’s what I got for an older version of my site using Chrome Dev Tools:</p> <p><img src="https://www.danielsieger.com/images/lighthouse_perf_old.jpg" alt="Performance results on old website"></p> <p>That’s quite a bit of red and orange. In contrast, this is what I get after optimization, using <a href="https://web.dev/measure">web.dev</a> this time:</p> <p><img src="https://www.danielsieger.com/images/lighthouse_perf_results.jpg" alt="Performance results on current website"></p> <p>Read on to see how you might get there as well.</p> <h2 id="minification">Minification</h2> <p>Low-hanging fruits first.</p> <p>A straightforward way to reduce the size of your pages is to minify the HTML code. Just like other text-based formats, HTML can be minified by reducing white space, comments, newlines, or optional closing tags.</p> <p>There is a Jekyll plugin that exactly does that job for you: <a href="https://github.com/penibelst/jekyll-compress-html">jekyll-compress-html</a>. The usage is super simple:</p> <ol> <li>Download the <code>compress.html</code> file from the repository</li> <li>Copy it to the <code>_layouts</code> folder of your Jekyll website</li> <li> <p>Edit your top-level layout file (usually <code>default.html</code>) to have the following front matter:</p>  </li> </ol> <p>This will change your HTML code from something nicely formatted and human-readable to something much more compact. Here is a comparison before and after enabling minification:</p> <p><img src="https://www.danielsieger.com/images/compress_before_after.png" alt="HTML minification example"></p> <p>This saves about 1K in size on a random HTML page of mine. Doesn’t sound too impressive, but Lighthouse already shows some improvement.</p> <h2 id="only-include-what-you-need">Only Include What You Need</h2> <p>From here on things get slightly more complicated, but the gain in speed is also significantly greater. Hang tight.</p> <p>Depending on your Jekyll setup, you eventually include a <em>lot</em> of additional assets like CSS frameworks, JavaScript libraries, or custom fonts. Chances are that you only need a subset of them.</p> <p>I use <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a> to build this site (see <a href="https://www.danielsieger.com/blog/2019/01/12/creating-jekyll-bootstrap-template.html">this post</a>), which depends on <a href="https://jquery.com/">jQuery</a>. Both libraries are quite heavyweight. Turns out I only need a fraction of them, offering an excellent opportunity for size reduction.</p> <h3 id="bootstrap">Bootstrap</h3> <p>I compile my own version of Bootstrap using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sass_(stylesheet_language)">Sass</a>, see this <a href="https://www.danielsieger.com/blog/2019/01/12/creating-jekyll-bootstrap-template.html">post</a> for details. Therefore, I can easily configure which CSS modules to include from the Bootstrap distribution. Here is my top-level <code>bootstrap.scss</code> file with all unused modules commented out:</p> <div><div><pre><code><span>@import</span> <span>"functions"</span><span>;</span>
<span>@import</span> <span>"variables"</span><span>;</span>
<span>@import</span> <span>"mixins"</span><span>;</span>
<span>@import</span> <span>"root"</span><span>;</span>
<span>@import</span> <span>"reboot"</span><span>;</span>
<span>@import</span> <span>"type"</span><span>;</span>
<span>@import</span> <span>"images"</span><span>;</span>
<span>@import</span> <span>"code"</span><span>;</span>
<span>@import</span> <span>"grid"</span><span>;</span>
<span>@import</span> <span>"tables"</span><span>;</span>
<span>/* @import "forms"; */</span>
<span>/* @import "buttons"; */</span>
<span>@import</span> <span>"transitions"</span><span>;</span>
<span>/* @import "dropdown"; */</span>
<span>/* @import "button-group"; */</span>
<span>/* @import "input-group"; */</span>
<span>/* @import "custom-forms"; */</span>
<span>@import</span> <span>"nav"</span><span>;</span>
<span>@import</span> <span>"navbar"</span><span>;</span>
<span>/* @import "card"; */</span>
<span>/* @import "breadcrumb"; */</span>
<span>/* @import "pagination"; */</span>
<span>/* @import "badge"; */</span>
<span>/* @import "jumbotron"; */</span>
<span>/* @import "alert"; */</span>
<span>/* @import "progress"; */</span>
<span>/* @import "media"; */</span>
<span>/* @import "list-group"; */</span>
<span>/* @import "close"; */</span>
<span>/* @import "toasts"; */</span>
<span>/* @import "modal"; */</span>
<span>/* @import "tooltip"; */</span>
<span>/* @import "popover"; */</span>
<span>/* @import "carousel"; */</span>
<span>/* @import "spinners"; */</span>
<span>@import</span> <span>"utilities"</span><span>;</span>
<span>/* @import "print"; */</span>
</code></pre></div></div> <p>That’s more than half of the modules, and I’m sure I could optimize this even further after more careful investigation.</p> <h3 id="jquery">jQuery</h3> <p>The Bootstrap JavaScript code depends on jQuery, which is quite a heavy library providing a lot of functionality. The good news is: As long as you are only using the CSS part of Bootstrap, you are fine <em>not</em> to include it.</p> <p>Check if you really need the Bootstrap JavaScript modules. If not, just remove the corresponding <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tags for both from your template and watch your performance score improving.</p> <p>In my case, I still use jQuery to retrieve comments on blog posts via GitHub, see <a href="https://www.danielsieger.com/blog/2018/10/23/blog-comments-using-github.html">here</a> for details. However, instead of including jQuery by default on all pages, I now only include it on blog posts using the comment functionality:</p> <div><div><pre><code>{% if page.issue and site.github_comments_repository %}
...
<span>&lt;script </span><span>src=</span><span>"/js/jquery.min.js"</span><span>&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</span>
...
{% endif %}
</code></pre></div></div> <p>I admit that it is still overkill include jQuery just to retrieve some data from GitHub. I’m sure there are more lightweight alternatives. Can you recommend one? Leave a comment below!</p> <h3 id="mathjax">MathJax</h3> <p>Many technical blogs include support for <a href="https://www.mathjax.org/">MathJax</a>, a convenient way to typeset mathematical formulas in your posts. Again, this is quite a heavy dependency pulling in lots of JavaScript code.</p> <p>Similarly, the solution is to use conditional inclusion: Only include MathJax when you really need it. Here, a dedicated front-matter variable in posts needing MathJax support will do the trick:</p> <div><div><pre><code>---
layout: post
title: Fancy Post With Lots of Math
mathjax: true
---
</code></pre></div></div> <p>Next, change your layout or include file (depending on where you actually include MathJax) to check for the variable being defined:</p> <div><div><pre><code>{% if page.mathjax %}
  <span>&lt;script </span><span>type=</span><span>"text/x-mathjax-config"</span><span>&gt;</span>
    <span>&lt;!--</span> <span>your</span> <span>config</span> <span>here</span> <span>--&gt;</span>
  <span>&lt;/script&gt;</span>
  <span>&lt;script </span><span>async</span> <span>src=</span><span>"/MathJax.js?config=TeX-AMS_HTML"</span><span>&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</span>
{% endif %}
</code></pre></div></div> <p>Note the <code>async</code> attribute above to enable asynchronous loading of the script. This eventually enhances performance in case you actually use MathJax.</p> <h2 id="deferred-loading">Deferred Loading</h2> <p>As shown above, adding the <code>async</code> attribute to <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tags is one way to improve page load time for scripts that you absolutely have to load. Using the <code>defer</code> attribute is another alternative. See the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/script">script</a> HTML element documentation for more information.</p> <p>Another commonly used technique is to defer the loading by placing your <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tags at the very end of the document. However, you should not need this anymore when using the <code>async</code> or <code>defer</code> attributes.</p> <p>For more information on how to eliminate render-blocking resources, please see the corresponding Google Developers <a href="https://web.dev/render-blocking-resources/">page</a>.</p> <h2 id="inline-critical-css">Inline Critical CSS</h2> <p>Another optimization technique is to <em>inline</em> CSS code directly into the HTML document instead of loading an external script. The key point is to inline only <em>critical</em> CSS styles needed to render the first paint and make the core functionality work.</p> <p>I adopted a simple version of this by using an online critical path CSS <a href="https://jonassebastianohlsson.com/criticalpathcssgenerator/">generator</a>. This takes your website URL and the full CSS code as input and generates a small set of critical CSS styles to include directly in your HTML header.</p> <p>The resulting CSS looks far from being optimal, but for the moment it works fine. I am sure there are better alternatives out there. Maybe you know something that integrates well with Jekyll? Comment below, or drop me a <a href="mailto:dsieger@posteo.de">mail</a>.</p> <h2 id="asynchronous-loading-of-css">Asynchronous Loading of CSS</h2> <p>Another tweak I applied was to defer loading of the full CSS files using a <del>hack</del> creative solution based on the media attribute.</p> <div><div><pre><code> <span>&lt;link</span> <span>rel=</span><span>"stylesheet"</span>
       <span>href=</span><span>"style.css"</span>
       <span>media=</span><span>"print"</span>
       <span>onload=</span><span>"this.media='all'"</span><span>&gt;</span>
</code></pre></div></div> <p>Note that this requires inlining of critical CSS, otherwise you will get ugly “Flashes of Unstyled Content” (FOUC). See the full <a href="https://css-tricks.com/the-simplest-way-to-load-css-asynchronously/">description</a> at <a href="https://css-tricks.com/">css-tricks.com</a> for more details.</p> <h2 id="fonts">Fonts</h2> <p>Custom web fonts are popular and available to everyone through services like <a href="https://fonts.google.com/">Google Fonts</a>. However, ask yourself if you really need them.</p> <p>As an alternative, consider using a system font stack relying on fonts already installed on the user’s system. This offers significant performance gains since</p> <ul> <li>there are no font files to transfer and load</li> <li>the browser likely has the fonts cached</li> </ul> <p>All major operating systems include somewhat decent fonts these days, so this really is an alternative. Plus, the system fonts match the look and feel of the operating system, so users are used to it.</p> <p>Here’s one way to use system fonts:</p> <div><div><pre><code><span>body</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>font-family</span><span>:</span> <span>-apple-system</span><span>,</span> <span>BlinkMacSystemFont</span><span>,</span> <span>"Segoe UI"</span><span>,</span>
               <span>Roboto</span><span>,</span> <span>Helvetica</span><span>,</span> <span>Arial</span><span>,</span> <span>sans-serif</span><span>,</span>
               <span>"Apple Color Emoji"</span><span>,</span> <span>"Segoe UI Emoji"</span><span>,</span>
               <span>"Segoe UI Symbol"</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div> <p>However, if you are like me and want more precise control over the fonts being used, there are some guidelines to do this efficiently:</p> <ul> <li>Host the fonts yourself if possible. This avoids additional connection requests and/or name resolution.</li> <li>Use <code>font-display: swap</code> in the <code>@font-face</code> definition to make sure text remains visible while the browser loads the fonts.</li> <li>Reduce the size of the font files by sub-setting. Only include the glyphs for the languages you are using.</li> <li> <p>Pre-load essential font files by adding appropriate special tags to your header:</p> <div><div><pre><code>  <span>&lt;link</span> <span>rel=</span><span>"preload"</span>
        <span>href=</span><span>"/font.woff2"</span>
        <span>as=</span><span>"font"</span>
        <span>type=</span><span>"font/woff2"</span> <span>crossorigin</span><span>&gt;</span>
</code></pre></div> </div> </li> </ul> <p>Last remark: Popular icon font sets such as <a href="https://fontawesome.com/">Font Awesome</a> are quite heavy as well. The latter contains something around 1000 icons (depending on your version), and I doubt you really need all of them. Consider creating a customized version containing only the icons you actually use. …</p></div></div>

    <h4>Developer Heuristics and Aphorisms</h4>
    <h6>Reflections from ten years in Software Development</h6>
    <hr>

    <p>
        The code you will find most jarring to review is your own, six months from now.
        </p>

    <p>
        There are two types of code review, short blocks of code, which you will analyse and critique, and large blocks of code, to which you will give a cursory glance and say ‘looks good’.
        </p>

    <p>
        Always refuse to review large chunks of code. Anything over 50 lines sees rapidly diminishing returns.
        </p>

    <p>
        The more a developer is obsessed with displaying deep knowledge of a language, framework, or philosophy, the less likely he is to be a good developer.
        </p>

    <p>
        The importance of testing is understated. The belief in testing is over zealous.
        </p>

    <p>
        Prioritise testing the parts of the codebase that never fail, over the parts that fail frequently. That is where the tail risk hides.
        </p>

    <p>
        Great code and great software are not the same thing.
        </p>

    <p>
        Customers / stakeholders will always change their minds. Always. Always. Always. Accept this as a fundamental fact of life.
        </p>

    <p>
        Don’t over optimise your code, unless your product is extremely mature, or solves a single, specific problem - and even then, don’t over optimise your code.
        </p>

    <p>
        All developers need to learn the basics of UI and UX - even backend developers
        </p>

    <p>
        You should always be thinking about the user.
        </p>

    <p>
        Good UI design isn’t always about making things simple and shiny. Expert users may want complexity.
        </p>

    <p>
        A steep learning curve is not necessarily a bad thing, if it allows an expert user to get things done quickly when learnt.
        </p>

    <p>
        Instead of learning the latest library or language, most developers would be better served learning sales.
        </p>

    <p>
        Think a good developer is expensive? They are an order of magnitude cheaper than a bad one.
        </p>

    <p>
        It amazes me how many software developers I see take a shitty or superior attitude with stakeholders in other parts of an organisation. If you are a developer, you are in the customer service business first and foremost.
        </p>

    <p>
        To a user, time has an elasticity. The first few seconds of a loading screen go by quickly, the new few seconds take an eternity.
        </p>

    <p>
        No new page or view should take longer than five seconds to load.
        </p>

    <p>
        Have a conversation with a fellow developer in which you both pause for five seconds each time you give a response. You will discover  a new appreciation for the frustration of loading times.
        </p>

    <p>
        Coding tests during interviews are pointless. Far better to give candidates a stakeholder test. Offer competing and conflicting requirements for a piece of software and watch closely how they respond.
        </p>

    <p>
        People who say ‘just read the documentation’, haven’t read the documentation.
        </p>

    <p>
        The number of bugs a user encounters vs. how irritated they become, is not linear. The first couple of bugs will be met with mild annoyance, the third and fourth with utter contempt.
        </p>

    <p>
        Good developers never complain to the end client. Great developers never complain.
        </p>

    <p>
        If a requirement is intractable, or impossible to deliver, always have an alternative suggestion lined up before communicating it to the client.
        </p>

    <p>
        Any challenges you encounter are more convincing to the client when you DON’T use technical language to explain them.
        </p>

    <p>
        Wait until a language, library or framework has been around for at least five years before learning it. If you have to use it before then, just learn enough to get by.
        </p>

    <p>
        The vast majority of a software developer’s career is learning just enough to get the job done. The myth of the all knowing developer is just that, a myth.
        </p>

    <p>
        Depending on what type of person you are, time constraints will either kill creativity or enhance it.
        </p>

    <p>
        Every developer thinks the code they inherit is shitty code. The developer who comes after you will think your code is shitty too.
        </p>

    <p>
        Software development is one of the most cultish industries around. Avoid fads in methodology, language, or design like the plague.
        </p>

    <p>
        Every organisation has their own definition of ‘agile’. None of them are correct.
        </p>

    <p>
        Over time, technical jargon seems to morph into management jargon. Be careful not to conflate the two.

    <p>
        99% of software projects do not need a CI pipeline.
        </p>

    <p>
        The code you will find most jarring to review is your own, six months from now.
        </p>

    <p>
        Don’t waste time trying to create the perfect deployment process, it is a form of technical masturbation.
        </p>

    <p>
        Your users don’t care what programming language you use.
        </p>

    <p>
        It is more important to understand different programming paradigms, than a large number of languages.
        </p>

    <p>
        Keep your functions and class methods short. Under 50 lines, and in most cases far less.
        </p>

    <p>
        Requirements gathering should be like sculpting a statue. Start with a rough outline, and use iteration and feedback to refine and polish.
        </p>

    <p>
        Don’t be afraid to recycle code.
        </p>

    <p>
        Do not bother to deliberately memorise large amounts of syntax that is easily available as an online resource. Save that capacity for more abstract concepts.
        </p>

    <p>
        During requirements gathering, what is not said can be more important than what is said. Politics, Organisation culture, and other intangibles matter. Account for them when creating your product.
        </p>

    <p>
        The more developers that are assigned to a delayed project, the longer that project will take to deliver.
        </p>

    <p>
        Functionality and aesthetics are more closely related than may think.
        </p>

    <p>
        95% of SaaS businesses can be replaced with a spreadsheet.
        </p>

    <p>
        If you only have enough time to make the design great or the architecture great, choose the former. Users are much more forgiving when they love the look and feel of a product.
        </p>

    <p>
        Under promise and over deliver.
        </p>

    <p>
        Decentralise your architecture as much as possible, even at the expense of efficiency
        </p>

    <p>
        The only start-up you should be working for is your own.
        </p>

    <p>
        The meaning of the word start-up has become so diluted as to become meaningless. If you’re not worried if you’re going to go bankrupt next month, you’re not working for a start-up.
        </p>

    <p>
        If you're a developer, It is better to work for managers who are non-technical. Technical managers will concentrate on what they know best  (technology), vs. outcomes. This lends itself to endless (pointless) debates over the tech stack and architecture.
        </p>

    <p>
        An average developer who is a great communicator will be far more successful than a great developer who is an average communicator.

    <p>
        The last ten years have been about big data, AI, processing power, and storage. The next ten years will be about perfecting human computer interaction to enable users to generate insight from it.
        </p>

    <p>
        It takes far more effort to write simple code, than it does to write complex code.
        </p>

    <p>
        Context switching is cancer to productivity.
        </p>

    <p>
        Have the courage to keep your daily stand up comments brief. Resist the urge to ‘pad out’ what you are doing.
        </p>

    <p>
        Most of the team aren’t listening to your daily stand-up, they’re thinking about what they are  going to say, or have already said.
        </p>

    <p>
        Most of your career will be spent developing CRUD apps, in one form or another.
        </p>

    <p>
        If you’re writing a feature that has to interact with another system within your organisation, increase your time estimate by a factor of four. If you work in the financial sector, increase it by a factor of eight.
        </p>

    <p>
        For every database table you create, add ‘created’ and ‘updated’ timestamp fields. This will future proof the queries you make.
        </p>

    <p>
        Reduce database tables to the smallest atomic unit possible. If you’re re-using a selector frequently, create a new table for it and use a foreignkey.
        </p>

    <p>
        It is better to store irrelevant data in a table, than it is to prune data you don’t think is relevant, only to add it later. Data storage is cheap. Development time is not.
        </p>

    <p>
        100% of projects need version control. Develop the discipline to use it well.
        </p>

    <p>
        You are a truly great developer when you remove more lines of code than you write.
        </p>

    <p>
        Software is easy. People are hard.

    <p>
        Never disable Copy / Paste in your app.
        </p>

    <p>
        Debugging code is twice as hard as writing it. Therefore, don’t try to make your code too clever.
        </p>

    <p>
        UX is the art of misdirection. And a beautiful UX will misdirect beautifully.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
						<p>There are two very different state-of-the-art chess engines: <a href="https://stockfishchess.org/">Stockfish</a> and <a href="https://lczero.org/">Leela Chess Zero</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Stockfish</strong> searches many more positions (100 000 000 per second) and evaluates them using computationally cheap heuristics. The tree search methodology is a refinement of alpha-beta pruning.</li>
<li><strong>Leela Chess Zero</strong>, a descendant of DeepMind’s AlphaZero, searches much fewer positions (40 000 per second), using a deep convolutional neural network (trained through millions of games of self-play) to evaluate positions. It has a different search methodology, namely <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo_tree_search">Monte Carlo tree search</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>The neural network employed by Leela Chess Zero is itself fascinating, using <a href="https://lczero.org/dev/backend/nn/">an architecture</a> similar to the <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1709.01507.pdf">SE-ResNet</a> image classification model. This residual tower of squeeze-and-excitation layers feeds into separate ‘value’ and ‘policy’ heads, for evaluating the position and deciding what to do next, respectively.</p>
<p>However, I want to talk more about the general strategy of searching much fewer positions and expending more effort on each position. In particular, this major difference between Stockfish and Leela Chess Zero is reflected in two of the <a href="https://catagolue.hatsya.com/software">many search programs</a> used to find spaceships in Conway’s Game of Life and related cellular automata:</p>
<ul>
<li>The program <strong>ntzfind</strong>, originally written by a pseudonymous author ‘zdr’ and enhanced by Matthias Merzenich, Aidan Pierce, and Tom Rokicki, is a depth-first tree search which uses a huge in-memory lookup table to find all possible choices for the next row based on previous rows.</li>
<li>The new program <strong>ikpx2</strong>, adapted from <a href="https://cp4space.hatsya.com/2018/03/11/a-rather-satisfying-winter/">the program I wrote to find the first elementary knightship</a>, is more analogous to Leela Chess Zero in that its search tree is much smaller, but the amount of work done at each node is much greater.</li>
</ul>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://cp4space.hatsya.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/logo.png" alt="" width="768" height="768" srcset="https://cp4space.hatsya.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/logo.png 768w, https://cp4space.hatsya.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/logo-300x300.png 300w, https://cp4space.hatsya.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/logo-150x150.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px"></p>
<p>In particular, ikpx2 uses a SAT solver to perform a deep lookahead to determine whether the current partial spaceship can be fully extended for several* more rows, and is therefore not close to a ‘dead end’. By comparison, ntzfind can only rule out a partial by performing a depth-first traversal of the entire subtree.</p>
<p>*this is configurable, but a typical value is 30.</p>
<p>The SAT solvers used are Armin Biere’s <a href="https://github.com/arminbiere/kissat">kissat</a> and <a href="https://github.com/arminbiere/cadical">CaDiCaL</a>. Kissat is more optimised than CaDiCaL, but doesn’t support incremental solving yet. As such, ikpx2 tries to learn (using basic reinforcement learning, specifically a multi-armed bandit model) which SAT solver is more appropriate for a given task. Theoretically, we could add additional state-of-the-art SAT solvers such as Mate Soos’s <a href="https://www.msoos.org/2020/07/cryptominisat-5-8-0-released/">cryptominisat</a>, and use a more powerful reinforcement learning model (such as a neural network) to evaluate the subproblem and decide which solver to use.</p>
<p>Having this ‘shallow tree with heavy leaves’ means that the current search progress can easily fit entirely within memory. Also, parallelism is easy: we keep a priority queue of tasks (partial spaceships) and have many CPU threads which do the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>remove a task from the queue;</li>
<li>solve it using SAT solvers;</li>
<li>communicate the results back to the main orchestrating thread.</li>
</ol>
<p>The results that are sent back to the main orchestrating thread are partials that have been extended (for 30 or so rows). A small initial segment of those rows are added to the in-memory tree as nodes; the remaining rows are not, as otherwise we’d end up with the same full unpruned search tree used by ntzfind and therefore our advantage is completely annihilated.</p>
<p>What happens to the remaining rows? Instead of merely discarding them, we take the entire extended partial and simulate it in the cellular automaton! Sometimes these partials evolve into an object that the main search couldn’t have found: for example, the tail might have a higher period than the rest of the spaceship, or leave a trail of debris behind. This idea seems to have first been explored by Paul Tooke in 2001, before being rediscovered 20 years later in the context of ikpx2.</p>
<h3>Results</h3>
<p>One of the early new ikpx2 search results using Paul Tooke’s idea was this partial, which evolves into a period-528 puffer engine:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://cp4space.hatsya.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/p528.gif" alt="" width="536" height="134"></p>
<p>Similarly, here is a novel period-21 spaceship found by John Winston Garth. He ran ikpx2 to look for 2c/7 spaceships; within 3 days of running on 12 CPU threads, it had both rediscovered David Eppstein’s <a href="https://conwaylife.com/wiki/Weekender">weekender</a> and found <a href="https://catagolue.hatsya.com/object/xq21_7dfxg88gxfd7zw123u2222u321zzweh1r4w4r1hezssoy6ossz12y821/b3s23/">a wholly new period-21 attachment</a> that clings to its tail:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://cp4space.hatsya.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Doodah.gif" alt="" width="418" height="562"></p>
<p>The user ‘iNoMed’ then discovered that two of these could interact to produce an exhaust that can be perturbed by a nearby weekender to emit a forward-moving glider every 42 generations:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://cp4space.hatsya.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/rake.gif" alt="" width="198" height="250"></p>
<p>Another feature of ikpx2 is its ability to find objects which have different components of different symmetries. Here, for example, is a spaceship with a symmetric head, asymmetric thorax, and symmetric abdomen. The tail is high-period, again having arisen from simulating a partial rather than from direct SAT solving:</p>
<h3><img loading="lazy" src="https://cp4space.hatsya.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/symmetry.gif" alt="" width="550" height="120"></h3>
<p>Somewhat disappointingly, ikpx2 has not succeeded in finding any new spaceship velocities in the standard Life rules. I tested it on the same input as the original ikpx used to find Sir Robin; ikpx2 was able to find the same result approximately 50x faster (in terms of core-hours elapsed).</p>
<p>There was a recent near-miss, which would be a (2,1)c/7 spaceship were it not for a single extra cell born in generation 7 (the left configuration, with or without the indicated green triplet, gives rise to the right configuration with the frustrating red tetraplet):</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://cp4space.hatsya.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/almost.png" alt="" width="961" height="321" srcset="https://cp4space.hatsya.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/almost.png 961w, https://cp4space.hatsya.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/almost-300x100.png 300w, https://cp4space.hatsya.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/almost-768x257.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 961px) 100vw, 961px"></p>
<p>The existence of near-misses such as this one makes me hopeful that it will eventually find a (2,1)c/7 spaceship given more time.</p>
<h3>Other cellular automata</h3>
<p>Unlike the original version of ikpx, this version is able to search a wide family of related cellular automata. In particular, it extracts the set of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quine%E2%80%93McCluskey_algorithm">prime implicants</a> from the cellular automaton rule (regarded as a 9-input 1-output boolean function) and uses that to encode the mechanics of the rule into the SAT problems.</p>
<p>In particular, two invocations of ikpx2 were sufficient to find the following growing knightship in the rule Day&amp;Night: one invocation to find the fast (2,1)c/5 frontend which stretches a thick oblique line, and another invocation to find a slower (2,1)c/6 tail which consumes it:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://cp4space.hatsya.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/growing.gif" alt="" width="164" height="341"></p>
<p>Here’s an 11c/22 spaceship in a nonstandard rule found by lemon41625, which is an even better demonstration of the symmetry switching. The discovery consists of odd-symmetric, asymmetric, and even-symmetric components with a high-period exhaust:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://cp4space.hatsya.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/lemon_11c22.gif" alt="" width="588" height="116"></p>
<h3>Source code</h3>
<p>The source code for ikpx2 is <a href="https://gitlab.com/apgoucher/ikpx2">open-source</a> (released under an MIT licence) so you can experiment with it yourself. It’s currently x86_64-specific, because it has <a href="https://gitlab.com/apgoucher/apgmera/">apgsearch</a> as a dependency (in order to quickly simulate the partials and examine whether they evolve into anything remotely interesting).</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Santa discovered his sack completely empty and an angry squirrel running around like mad and defecating!</p>
<p>Help get all the presents back and save Xmas! Don't step into poo!</p>
<p><em>This is an actual Atari Lynx game, so you will need an Atari Lynx emulator to play it or use one of the many&nbsp;<a href="https://atarigamer.com/articles/the-best-flash-sd-multi-cartridge-for-atari-lynx" rel="nofollow noopener">Flash/SD or Homebrew carts</a>&nbsp;to play it on a real Lynx.</em><br></p>
<h2>About</h2>
<p>This game was made for the&nbsp;<a href="https://itch.io/jam/lynxmas2020">LynXmas 2020</a> game jam, a 15 day long game jam without final rankings for no other purpose but to have some fun and make some Xmas cheer! All entries into the competition had to be 32KB or less.</p>
<p>The game was coded in about a&nbsp;week using CC65, ABCmusic, GIMP and a couple of other support tools.</p>
<p><img src="https://img.itch.zone/aW1nLzQ3OTczMTQuZ2lm/original/El%2Fu1m.gif"><br></p>

<h2>How to Play</h2>
<p>Move Santa left, right, up or down on the screen. Once you are standing over a present, press the A button to crouch and pick it up.</p>
<p>The squirrel will defecate so avoid stepping into his poo, it will stick to your boots and&nbsp;slow you down!</p>
<p>Every time the squirrel drops a present, it will try to hurry to get it back so get it before he does, or you'll lose points! Every time you recover a present,&nbsp;the squirrel's frenzy level increases, once his frenzy has reached its maximum, he will run around extremely fast trying to confuse you.</p>
<p><img src="https://img.itch.zone/aW1nLzQ3OTc0MzQucG5n/original/Vj3ZKK.png"><br></p>

<h2>Atari Lynx Development</h2>
<p>If you are interested in developing your own games for Atari Lynx, check out the&nbsp;<a href="https://atarigamer.com/pages/atari-lynx-programming-resources" rel="nofollow noopener">Programming Resources</a>&nbsp;page. Lynx is one of the easiest retro game consoles to get started coding with, so if you have an idea for a game, don't hold back, code it for the Lynx!</p>

<h2>Credits</h2>
<p>I would not have been able to create this game without the following free graphics assets. Even though I didn't use every single frame, my sprites and animations were heavily inspired by these.</p>

		<h4>now with more <a href="https://dnsrpz.info/">RPZ</a></h4>
		<p>For those of you who want to block ad's and trackers and not use pi-hole, but would like it to be fully automated.</p>
		<p>I use to run shell scripts on a cronjob to download domain blocklists and reload unbound. Some good reference examples:
		<a href="https://www.geoghegan.ca/unbound-adblock.html">unbound-adblock</a> 
		<a href="https://www.tumfatig.net/20190405/blocking-ads-using-unbound8-on-openbsd/">Blocking Ads using unbound(8) on OpenBSD</a></p>
		<p>In early 2020 nlnetlabs added support for Response Policy Zones which makes it possible to use unbound as a dns firewall.
		   This is a similar concept to using unbound.conf's local-zone:, but incorporates a few different ways to get your RPZ feed or 
		   data without having to reload or wait for unbound to reload. In fact unbound will handle refreshing it's data without a cronjob to 
		   reach out and download and reformat it.</p>
		<p>There are paid subscriptions available for DNS rpz feeds, but I have been using the spark list from <a href="https://energized.pro/">Energized Pro</a>.
		Their repo on <a href="https://github.com/EnergizedProtection/block">github</a> provides lots of info on what list sources are incorporated into their block lists.</p>
		<p>To get started using the spark list, I've posted the relevant snippets that need to be added to your config file for unbound. 
		Along with a plain text file where you can override the blocklist.</p>
		<h4>unbound.conf:</h4>
	<pre><code>server:
	# Needed to use the rpz policy files
	module-config: "respip validator iterator"

	# Needed for cert checking your rpz URL
	tls-cert-bundle: /etc/ssl/cert.pem
	

rpz:
	# this is where we list any domains that we don't want blocked
	# first match wins the rpz action
        name: "allowed list"
	zonefile: "/var/unbound/etc/allowed_domains.txt"
rpz:
	name: "energized spark"
	url: https://block.energized.pro/spark/formats/rpz.txt
	</code></pre>
	<p>Sometimes you want certain domains to always be available. They can be allowed by using rpz-passthru action. Documentation for 
	<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/id/draft-vixie-dnsop-dns-rpz-00.html#rfc.section.3">Policy Actions</a>. Unbound currently only supports 4 of the 6 actions, 
	which are NXDOMAIN, NODATA, PASSTHRU, and DROP.</p>
	<pre><code>
	+----------+---------------------+
	|  Action  |  RR type and RDATA  |
	+----------+---------------------+
	| NXDOMAIN | CNAME .             |
	| NODATA   | CNAME *.            |
	| PASSTHRU | CNAME rpz-passthru. |
	| DROP     | CNAME rpz-drop.     |

so that once it's built for the first time, we don't need to rebuild it any more. The integrity of <code>bsb -make-world</code> will be broken
when the assumption does not hold.</p><p>In this release, we fix the integrity of <code>bsb -make-world</code> which allows user to change the dependencies.
The fix is well implementend that people who don't do such modifications will not pay for it.</p><p>This is one of the highest desired feature request based on the
<a href="https://github.com/rescript-lang/rescript-compiler/issues/4361#issuecomment-739538789" rel="noopener noreferrer">user feedback</a>, so we will expand a bit here why it is tricky
to implement it without compromising performance.</p><p>In ReScript compilation scheme, dependencies as packages are treated as a blackbox,
changes of dependencies should be <em>transitive</em>. The is due to that we have cross module
optimizations and the binary interface itself is a hash of its dependencies.
So for a package dependency chain: A -&gt; B -&gt; C, if A changes and B does not change, C still needs get rebuilt.
Because the intermediate output of B may still change due to the change of A.
To make things worse, each package comes with an installation process which is a shell script, so re-installation will make the
package look like freshly built.</p><p>In this release, we track the installation in the build graph as well, and we calculate the hash of the installation of dependencies and put it in the
dependent's command line flags for building binary artifacts. Such strategy benefits in such aspects: </p><ul><li><p>The calculation of the hash of installation is almost free since it is just one stat, we don't need track all dependencies' artifacts.</p></li><li><p>The introducion of such hashing does not appear in parsing, so that the changes of dependencies will never trigger re-parsing.</p></li><li><p>Once the package installation is a nop, the transitive rebuild graph will be cut off so that we can save some unneeded rebuild.</p></li><li><p>When people make changes to the depdendencies, if such changes don't change the package interface, it will not trigger the build of its dependents.</p></li></ul><h3>Introducing <code>pinned-dependencies</code><span><span><a href="#introducing-pinned-dependencies"><svg height="0.8em" width="0.8em" viewBox="0 0 20.003 19.944"><path d="M11.927 7.908a4.819 4.819 0 00-3.968-1.3 5.091 5.091 0 00-2.921 1.508L1.47 11.684a4.82 4.82 0 00.192 7.122 4.994 4.994 0 006.76-.4l3.7-3.776a.109.109 0 00-.067-.184s-.649.029-1.132.006a10.116 10.116 0 01-1.35-.226.308.308 0 00-.243.088l-2.529 2.609a2.733 2.733 0 01-3.583.319 2.64 2.64 0 01-.247-3.951l3.755-3.753a2.7 2.7 0 013.654-.073.108.108 0 00.15 0l1.4-1.4a.114.114 0 00-.003-.157z"></path><path d="M8.076 12.036a4.822 4.822 0 003.967 1.3 5.089 5.089 0 002.922-1.509l3.568-3.568a4.818 4.818 0 00-.192-7.121 5 5 0 00-6.761.4l-3.7 3.777a.108.108 0 00.067.183s.648-.028 1.132-.006a10.151 10.151 0 011.35.226.3.3 0 00.243-.088l2.529-2.608a2.732 2.732 0 013.581-.319 2.638 2.638 0 01.249 3.95l-3.755 3.754a2.706 2.706 0 01-3.654.073.107.107 0 00-.15 0l-1.4 1.4a.113.113 0 00.004.156z"></path></svg></a><a id="introducing-pinned-dependencies"></a></span></span></h3><p>To make <code>bsb -make-world</code> more pratical, we also introduce a new concept called: <code>pinned-dependencies</code>.

To be considered senior, a developer (or some other worker type for that matter) should have experience in a set of areas required for the job. However, to get that experience, the developer should be given a chance to work on projects that provide that kind of experience. And here is the tricky part — nobody wants people who do not know how to do their job. Therefore, you will make mistakes, and mistakes are costly (sometimes a little, other times a lot).</p><p>The high-qualified talent pool is significantly smaller than the increasing demand for such workers, and companies sometimes must hire people without all the necessary experience. Given this reality, it is interesting what defines and shapes such decisions.</p><p>The answer to this question might be controversial to some people and a natural one to others:</p><blockquote><p>If you must choose between two people who do not have the necessary experience, you will select the one who made a better impression of a person who will handle the job competently.</p></blockquote><p>In other words, you will choose the person who has better soft-skills and learns faster.</p><h2 id="soft-skills-vs-hard-skills">Soft-Skills vs. Hard-Skills</h2><p>Although it may sound counterintuitive, you cannot learn everything you need to become a senior developer beforehand. You cannot be fully prepared to become a senior engineer without working on challenging projects, making mistakes, and learning in the process.</p><p>But to get to work on such projects, usually, you have to possess the necessary knowledge and skills already. Otherwise, few companies are willing to hire people who do not know how to do their job.</p><p>Therefore, if you don’t have the full skill set needed for the job, it requires a leap of faith your employer has to take to promote you to bigger and more complex projects that will broaden your experience. And that is possible if you have other traits, such as (but not limited to):</p><ul><li>communication skills</li><li>stress management</li><li>analytical thinking</li><li>proactivity</li><li>etc.</li></ul><p>Furthermore, this is valid for any degree of seniority. Even (and especially) if you are a junior dev, you have to take on more complex tasks so that you will be able to get the necessary experience.</p><h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2><p>To become better, you need to work on tasks of increasing difficulty. That is partially achievable through working on personal projects, but often that is not enough.</p><p>Due to its dynamic nature, software engineering jobs imply a certain degree of learning on the job. Therefore, if you don’t have all the necessary experience, you might still get the job (or that promotion) if you have the right set of soft-skills.</p><p>If you liked this article, consider subscribing below and following me on twitter (<a href="https://twitter.com/iuliangulea">@iuliangulea</a>).</p><hr></div></div>]]>

<p>Modern languages like Python, NodeJS, and Go make it easy to handle
concurrent requests for multiple customers at the same time by using threads or goroutines.</p>

<p>Such services seem very cost effective because one process can handle hundreds or thousands
of tenants. However, this efficiency comes at a hidden, steep price. When language runtime
scheduling breaks down, one tenant can cause an outage for everyone.</p>

<h2 id="concurrency-made-simple">Concurrency made simple</h2>

<p>Go makes it trivial to handle concurrency.</p>

<p>Here is an example from <a href="https://tour.golang.org/concurrency/1">A Tour Of Go</a> that
launches two goroutines that work independently of each other:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="go"><span>package</span> <span>main</span>

<p>The Go runtime makes sure that each goroutine gets its fair share of CPU and memory.
It gives the impression that both run in parallel:</p>

<p>We can imagine that the Go runtime executes the program in the following order:</p>

<p>This parallelism and blocking call is an illusion created by a combination of the use of the asynchronous
<a href="https://kovyrin.net/2006/04/13/epoll-asynchronous-network-programming/">epoll</a> Linux function
and Go’s built in runtime scheduler. <code>epoll</code> can efficiently handle thousands of network sockets at once.</p>

<p>The Go runtime activates a smart scheduler to handle <code>go</code> statements - goroutines.
It makes sure that every goroutine gets its share of CPU time and suspends
execution when the function is waiting on network or file input/output.
It’s not unusual to have tens of thousands of goroutines in the system
and see the Go runtime handle the requests well.</p>

<p>If you are interested in a more detailed intro to the Go scheduler, take a look at this article
from <a href="https://www.ardanlabs.com/blog/2018/08/scheduling-in-go-part2.html">Ardan Labs</a>.</p>

<p>This makes Go a great language for handling concurrent network requests
that constitute the bulk of an average software as a service program that reads and writes to a database
or an external service.</p>

<h2 id="when-fair-scheduling-breaks-down">When fair scheduling breaks down</h2>

<p>Language runtimes do not have full control and visibility into
the resource allocation that is done by the Linux kernel.</p>

<p>This is where the multi-tenancy service promise of fair scheduling breaks down.</p>

<p>Because of the inefficient factorial implementation that took a lot of iterations
and number crunching, tenant 0 consumed all the CPU time and degraded performance for the others.</p>

<p>We can fix the factorial function and add code that limits the possible input numbers.
However, our service has just suffered an outage due to a bug in the code for all our customers,
<a href="https://goteleport.com/resources/videos/workflow-access-pageduty-slack/">PagerDuty</a> is ringing and we are not sleeping again.</p>

<h2 id="a-real-world-example">A real-world example</h2>

<p>I made up our factorial example, but let’s create a real world one using
decompression bombs.</p>

<p>Decompression bombs are specially crafted archives that are small, but expand
into files ranging from tens to thousands of times their size.</p>

<p>They are specifically designed to take down your service. Anyone can download
one <a href="https://bomb.codes/bombs">from the internet</a>.</p>

<p>Some archives use simple techniques like compressing very large files
filled with zeroes. They take advantage of the fact that compression algorithms
represent a huge file with zeroes with a version of <code>repeat billion zeroes here</code>.</p>

<p>More <a href="https://www.usenix.org/system/files/woot19-paper_fifield_0.pdf">sophisticated approaches</a>
explore compression techniques in depth and craft evil files
that can explode to petabytes of disk space. The danger is real and lots of programs are
vulnerable on the internet right now.</p>

<p>Let’s explore the effect of such archive on a multi-tenant service.
Our new service unpacks the archive and counts the number of words in a file:</p>

<p>The core of the problem is that CPU time is limited. Programming language runtimes lack
the control and context required to efficiently distribute the CPU time per goroutine.</p>

<p>There is no great solution in the modern programming language runtime that solves
this problem once and for all. Some language runtimes, like the <a href="https://hamidreza-s.github.io/erlang/scheduling/real-time/preemptive/migration/2016/02/09/erlang-scheduler-details.html">Erlang</a>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
  <p>Continuing my search for a better debugging experience for my current projects (zig/c, nixos). </p>
<p>The <a href="https://scattered-thoughts.net/writing/looking-for-debugger/">first post</a> resulted in a ton of suggestions and I tried them all.</p>
<h2 id="gdb-tui-again">gdb -tui (again)</h2>
<p><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25407161">taviso explained</a> how to use the tui properly. </p>
<p>C-l fixes the display and using <code>gdb -tty $SOME_OTHER_TTY</code> stops it from getting messed up in the first place.</p>
<p>Readline bindings (C-n, C-p etc) work in the command window even while the source window has focus. <code>focus cmd</code> gives focus to the command window so I can use arrow keys again.</p>
<p>C-x A is supposed to toggle the tui but for me just crashes, in both alacritty and xterm. I've <a href="https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/issues/106868">reported this against nix</a> for now, since that's the most likely culprit. (EDIT nope, <a href="https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/pull/106981">it was a gdb bug</a>).</p>
<h2 id="emacs-gdb">emacs gdb</h2>
<p>Many people suggested using <code>gdb</code> and <code>gdb-many-windows</code> instead of <code>gud</code>. </p>
<p>This is much better - I get a clickable thread list, backtrace and locals list.</p>

<p>It displays all my locals as "&lt;complex data type&gt;" which is not super helpful. There is a <a href="https://debbugs.gnu.org/cgi/bugreport.cgi?bug=34589">patch</a> to improve this but it looks like it got delayed by legal issues.</p>

<p>For gdb this <a href="https://emacs-lsp.github.io/dap-mode/page/configuration/#native-debug-gdblldb">requires</a> the vscode extension which I couldn't get working in the last post, so I haven't investigated further.</p>
<h2 id="clion-again">clion (again)</h2>
<p>Kaylee Blake emailed me:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Several of the issues you encountered with CLion are ones I have previously encountered, and thankfully two of them are solvable and one can be worked around. </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Your variables are (probably) not being displayed because CLion leans on its language support for computing precise start-of-scope for variables (GDB doesn't support this DWARF feature, sadly), but unfortunately defaults to assuming that variables are always out of scope if its language support isn't capable of mapping debug symbols to declarations. (It appears that the Zig plugin doesn't have any debugger integration). As such, you need to click on the gear icon on the left of the debug pane (in your screenshot, hidden behind a <code>&gt;&gt;</code> symbol at the bottom), and uncheck "Hide out-of-scope variables".</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>To use the Memory View, you need to right-click on any variable and choose "Show in Memory View", which will actually cause the pane to load. I have no idea why this is required given that the Memory View is perfectly capable of navigating to raw addresses or addresses computed by arbitrary expressions once the pane has loaded.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>You (probably) can't set breakpoints through the UI because the Zig plugin doesn't register the Zig filetype as capable of having breakpoints set on it. There's no way to fix this without writing a plugin, unfortunately, but you can still use the GDB console to set breakpoints. They won't persist between sessions, though, or show up in the UI.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Both of the fixes worked. I can now see variables and open them in the memory view.</p>
<p><img src="https://scattered-thoughts.net/writing/looking-for-debugger-2/clion.png" alt=""></p>
<p>The memory view doesn't support editing memory, but I can still do that in the gdb console.</p>
<p>I added <code>*actual.items.ptr@100</code> to the watches list and it rendered the whole array perfectly happily.</p>
<p>Setting breakpoints in the gdb console seemed to work at first, but restarting the program to get to the breakpoint doesn't. If I rerun using the button in the debugger, the breakpoints disappear. If I try to restart the program from within gdb, it crashes:</p>
<pre><code><span>(gdb) info breakpoints
No breakpoints or watchpoints.
(gdb) b Tree.searchForwards
Breakpoint 1 at 0x207222: file /home/jamie/focus/lib/focus/tree.zig, line 591.
(gdb) run
Command 'run' is not supported.
(gdb) start
The program being debugged has been started already.
Start it from the beginning? (y or n) [answered Y; input not from terminal]
Temporary breakpoint 2 at 0x2097dc: file /nix/store/5g4w66g606d46w8pmzwzq7flrlk3k7cs-zig/lib/zig/std/start.zig, line 243.
Starting program: /home/jamie/focus/test 1&gt; '/dev/pts/4' 2&gt; '/dev/pts/5' 
During startup program exited with code 1.
</span></code></pre>
<p>I can get this to work by starting the program, immediately pausing, setting a breakpoint and then resuming. </p>
<p>Holding F8 to continue runs smoothly, like most of the other debuggers. But unlike most of the other debuggers the local variables stop being displayed until I release the key, so I can't just watch the changes in real time.</p>
<h2 id="netbeans">netbeans</h2>
<p>I made a new C++ project with the wizard and hit "Debug Main Project". At first I though nothing happened, but after a while I noticed a small red message box at the bottom-right of the screen.</p>
<p><img src="https://scattered-thoughts.net/writing/looking-for-debugger-2/netbeans_0.png" alt=""></p>
<p>It's actually bigger when it first appears, but it shrinks after a few seconds of not being noticed.</p>
<p>Anyway:</p>
<p><img src="https://scattered-thoughts.net/writing/looking-for-debugger-2/netbeans_1.png" alt=""></p>
<p>It says it can't write to /tmp.</p>
<pre><code><span>jamie@machine:~/nixpkgs$ cat &gt; /tmp/test
foo
jamie@machine:~/nixpkgs$ cat /tmp/test
foo
</span></code></pre>
<p>I can write to /tmp.</p>
<p>It also says I should do something like <code>netbeans -J-Dcnd.tmpbase="/home/jamie/netbeans-project"</code>. But that produces the same error message, still referring to "/tmp" rather than the directory I gave it. Did I spell something wrong?</p>
<p>Also:</p>
<pre><code><span>[nix-shell:~]$ strace netbeans 2&gt;&amp;1 | grep 'tmp'

[nix-shell:~]$
</span></code></pre>
<p>It doesn't actually seem to be trying to write "/tmp". It actually doesn't issue any syscalls at all when I press "Debug Main Project" and trigger the message. So I think it's just misreporting some other error. The underlying issue is probably nix-related again.</p>
<p>Also... I try to avoid ranting about software, because software is hard. But if you give me an error message and then make the error text non-selectable and then in the context menu only offer "Mark As Read" instead of "Copy To Clipboard So I Can Google This" then it makes debugging a lot slower.</p>
<h2 id="cgdb">cgdb</h2>
<p>Broadly similar to gdb -tui. It shows the source window and has a lot of useful keyboard shortcuts, but it doesn't display much ambient information like current backtrace or local variables. Everything seems to work, but it's not what I'm looking for.</p>
<h2 id="kdevelop">kdevelop</h2>
<pre><code><span>[nix-shell:~]$ kdevelop --version
kdevelop 5.5.2
</span></code></pre>
<p>Running, breaking, setting watchpoints and navigating the backtrace all worked smoothly.</p>
<p>There doesn't seem to be a memory view or a way to display arbitrary expressions. I tried adding <code>display (*actual.items.ptr)@100</code> in the gdb console and it didn't appear anywhere on screen, nor did it print the result in the console after the first time.</p>
<p>The rendering of large arrays is a bit annoying - you have to click at the beginning to reveal a few more elements, but they appear at the end. So getting the whole thing on screen requires lots of scrolling.</p>
<p>The key binding for 'next' is also in use by kate, so you have to go into the bindings menu and disambiguate. Which wouldn't be a big deal except that it reset several times over the course of a single session so I had to keep visiting the bindings menu.</p>
<h2 id="gdb-dashboard">gdb-dashboard</h2>
<p>An init file for gdb that adds a dashboard, which is printed whenever the program stops and can be hooked to print at other times too.</p>
<p><img src="https://scattered-thoughts.net/writing/looking-for-debugger-2/gdb-dashboard.png" alt=""></p>
<p>This is pretty great. It doesn't offer the easy point-and-click of a gui but it does reliably put a bunch of useful context on the screen. And it manages to do that without breaking or hiding basic features of gdb like most of the gui frontends I tried. </p>
<p>I'm still on the lookout for a good gui debugger, but this is what I'll use in the meantime.</p>
<h2 id="voltron">voltron</h2>
<p>Loris Cro suggested voltron which is similar to gdb-dashboard but opens the various view in separate terminals and updates them in real time. This seems like a strict improvement and I really like the idea.</p>
<p>After wading through the usual python dependency management morass, I managed to occasionally run some voltron views but mostly managed to crash it repeatedly, and occasionally gdb too. </p>
<p>(The gdb crashes are in <a href="https://paste.sr.ht/%7Ejamii/ad867039557cc4c6f5ffe22e4f14a0f13fa78c86">somewhere inside printf</a> so this might be the same issue as the tui crash above.) </p>
<h2 id="gdb-frontend">gdb-frontend</h2>
<p>Ilmari Lauhakangas suggested the somewhat generically named gdb-frontend. </p>
<p>If I type the full path in the file picker it pops up "An error has occurred". You have to type the dirname and then pick the file from the list.</p>
<p>When I ran the program it reached the breakpoint and then the UI stopped responding to button clicks and occasionally spat out messages saying the gdb main thread was blocking.</p>
<p>After C-c in terminal it left behind a bunch of ophan gdb processes that prevented gdbfrontend from being restarted.</p>
<h3 id="ddd-again">ddd (again)</h3>
<p><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25410215">drosan explained</a> that in ddd the focus follows the mouse which explains why I had trouble typing in the text boxes.</p>
<p>The other bugs I experienced are still blockers though.</p>

<p>Other tools that came up in the conversation:</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/hugsy/gef">gef</a> and <a href="https://github.com/pwndbg/pwndbg">pwndbg</a> add a bunch of commands to gdb that are useful for low-level debugging and reverse engineering. 
<a href="https://github.com/radareorg/radare2">radare2</a> is an independent set of tools for the same purpose that can optionally connect to gdb. I don't have much use for these at the moment, but it's good to know about them.</p>
<p><a href="https://codeclap.itch.io/codeclap">codeclap</a> looks interesting but is still in alpha and doesn't have a demo.</p>
<p><a href="https://pernos.co/">pernosco</a> is a project I've been keeping an eye on. It's not currently affordable for hobby stuff, but I can certainly imagine paying for it when I start doing commercial work again.</p>
<p><a href="https://frida.re/">frida</a> injects javascript code into binaries. At the very least, this enables post-hoc println debugging. I've put aside a weekend in my calendar to try it out.</p>
<p><a href="https://justine.storage.googleapis.com/blinkenlights/index.html">blinkenlights</a> I think is a way to watch your code execute as directly as possible, so you can build intuition for what is actually happening on the hardware. I tried it out quickly and it rendered a single frame before exiting with code 0. But it's interesting enough that I made a note to come back and try it again next year.</p>
<p>I haven't tried many proprietary options so far. While I have a strong preference for foss tools, I'm open to suggestions for good proprietary tools so long as I can try them out without emailing a sales team for a quote.</p>

Researchers at the University of Oulu in Finland have developed a new method for detecting changes in the brain’s cleaning system. The study showed that in patients with Alzheimer’s disease, pulsations in the brain’s blood vessels differ from those in healthy individuals. This discovery enables the development of new types of treatments and diagnostic tools for memory loss diseases.<br></p><p>The study is the first to demonstrate that brain pulsation differences could be used in diagnostics. The method produces a magnetic image of the functioning of the brain’s cleaning system, known as the glymphatic system, and the changes that occur in it. The glymphatic system uses blood vessel pulsation to clean the brain of waste products. If disturbances occur in the cleaning system, waste products start to accumulate in the brain, leading to premature brain degeneration over a period of 10 to 20 years.</p><p>The study showed for the first time that the differences observed are precisely due to differences in heart rate and respiratory rate. The differences were also linked to the progression of the disease.</p><p>‘It has been known for a long time that there are two types of neuropathology associated with Alzheimer’s disease: Amyloid plaques and accumulations of abnormally phosphorylated tau protein in neurons. However, it is not known why these so-called brain plaques start to accumulate. The glymphatic system is a credible theory of the cause of the problems in the brain cleaning system. This study strongly supports the idea of a glymphatic system and is one of the first studies to show that pulsations are different in those suffering from Alzheimer’s,’ explains brain researcher Timo Tuovinen. The study is part of Tuovinen’s doctoral dissertation.</p><p>‘The study significantly increases our understanding of Alzheimer’s disease mechanisms and lays the foundation for new diagnostic tools. By better understanding Alzheimer’s disease, more effective treatments can be developed in the future,’ says Professor Vesa Kiviniemi.</p><p>The study was conducted in cooperation with the University of Oulu, the University Hospital of Oulu and several international partners.

<p>I’ve worked in startups my whole career, first as a software engineer, then as a Chief Technology Officer (CTO), and most recently <a href="https://www.karllhughes.com/posts/cto-writer">as a founder</a>. In that time, the most common question I get from non-technical founders has been, “How can I find a CTO or technical co-founder?”</p>
<h2 id="what-does-a-startup-cto-do">What Does a Startup CTO Do?</h2>
<p>First, it’s important to understand that <a href="https://www.karllhughes.com/posts/roles-of-startup-cto">startup CTOs have a very unique role</a>. They are responsible for <em>everything</em> in the software product from writing code for your MVP to hiring engineers to company-wide security. Being a startup CTO is hard - you’re basically doing 13 jobs at once.</p>

<p>That said, everyone at a startup is doing a lot, so CTOs aren’t really special. My point is that you aren’t <em>just</em> looking for a software engineer or <em>just</em> an engineering manager. You need someone with a hybrid set of hands-on and higher-level thinking skills. The CTO role is a really difficult one to fill.</p>
<p><em>Note: If you’re looking for more reading material, I’ve assembled a list of <a href="https://www.karllhughes.com/posts/startup-books">my favorite books for startup founders here</a>.</em></p>
<h2 id="tips-for-finding-a-cto">Tips for Finding a CTO</h2>
<p>While it’s difficult, it’s clearly not impossible for non-technical founders to find a CTO.</p>
<p>At <a href="https://www.karllhughes.com/work/">my last two startups</a>, I was the first engineering hire, and I know dozens of others technical co-founders and CTOs in Chicago alone. Unfortunately, it’s not as easy as putting together a <a href="https://www.karllhughes.com/posts/cto-interview-questions">list of interview questions</a> and posting a job listing. After having conversations with several of my CTO friends, I put this list of tips together for non-technical founders looking to attract a technical co-founder or CTO.</p>
<h3 id="1-hone-your-vision">1. Hone Your Vision</h3>
<p>With rare exceptions, technical co-founders are likely not the visionaries. We tend to be more execution-focused, but we are still attracted to founders who have a strong vision for why their product needs to exist. People who join early stage startups <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/85broads/2013/11/18/the-millennial-startup-revolution/#51b08ce7622d">tend to be idealists</a>. We know the world doesn’t work the way it should, and we want to be out there making it right.</p>
<p>Founders who have a clear vision that is aligned with something their CTO cares about will get a huge leg up.</p>
<h3 id="2-hone-your-business-plan">2. Hone Your Business Plan</h3>
<p>On the other hand, few engineers are going to be sold on vision alone. The biggest mistake I’ve seen startups make is overbuilding before they validated their market. So when founders approach me, one of the first things I ask is, “How are you going to make money?” followed closely behind, “What have you done to prove that this works?”</p>
<p>Consultant <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/coreyhaines/">Corey Haines</a> presents it this way:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>1) What’s your business model?</p>
<p>2) What does “traction” mean with respect to that business model?</p>
<p>3) What is your current traction in that context, and how has it grown over the past couple months?</p>
<p>4) What is your plan for accelerating that traction (give the context of the business model)?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Your technical founder will know the value he or she brings, so you’ve got to prove yours. As the non-technical founder,
the burden is on you to prove that the business model works.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/wedrzaz.jpg" alt="A good CTO will ask about your business plan"></p>
<h3 id="3-the-product-is-not-your-biggest-barrier">3. The Product is Not Your Biggest Barrier</h3>
<p>If you had true market validation, investors would pour money into your startup and you could hire
the best tech talent in the world. Unfortunately, a lot of <a href="http://humbledmba.com/please-please-please-stop-asking-how-to-find">non-technical founders think they must have a working app</a> in order to validate their idea.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“If you can’t sell [your idea] without an MVP, what makes you think you can sell it with one? Honestly, the difference is smaller than you’d think.” - <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/joshsymonds/">Josh Symonds</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Get creative: <a href="https://www.karllhughes.com/posts/creating-a-tech-startup-without-a-developer">build the MVP yourself</a>, sell a prototype, build a huge email list of interested buyers, or hire a contractor to build your first version.</p>
<p>I joined The Graide Network because the two non-technical founders had built a business generating real revenue off email and spreadsheets. Hustle in the face of not having a product is extremely attractive.</p>
<h3 id="4-technical-talent-is-in-high-demand">4. Technical Talent is in High Demand</h3>
<p>Most software engineers with more than 5 years of experience have little trouble finding a job. The trick here is to narrow your market so that your startup can stand out.</p>
<p>Limit your search to engineers who:</p>
<ul>
<li>Know and trust you personally,</li>
<li>Have founded or been part of a startup before,</li>
<li>Done open source projects in your problem space, or</li>
<li>Work in the industry you’re interested in.</li>
</ul>
<p>Most co-founders <a href="https://blog.close.com/the-secret-to-successful-and-lasting-co-founder-relationships/">knew each other long before they started a company together</a>, so it’s unlikely that you’ll find a random person on the internet who shares your vision. Limit your efforts on people who meet specific interest areas and you’re more likely to at least start a conversation.</p>
<h3 id="5-play-the-long-game">5. Play the Long Game</h3>
<p>Once you start having meetings, don’t lead with, “So, do you want to build my startup?”</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Do ‘this thing’ for equity because you love it” usually means “because <em>I</em> love it” - <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/griffincaprio/">Griffin Caprio</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Start small, ask their advice, get to know them. Ask for introductions, mention that you’re keeping an eye out for a technical co-founder, but remember, your business shouldn’t depend on it. Tell them about the success you’re having, the challenges your facing, and see what gets them excited.</p>
<p>End every meeting asking if there are other engineers you could talk to who might know about your startup’s problem space.</p>
<h3 id="6-put-skin-in-the-game">6. Put Skin in the Game</h3>
<p>By taking a job with a startup, an engineer is forgoing most of their guaranteed salary in exchange for a piece of a fledgling company. <strong>Level the playing field by putting your money into the business.</strong></p>
<p>$50,000 might not pay a full-time engineer’s salary in many places in the United States, but it might be enough to attract a CTO to moonlight for you. If you can’t get that kind of money together, make pre-sales, borrow money, or raise money. You’re unlikely to find a technical co-founder who will work for free from day one.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/SIkXBf3.jpg" alt="Put skin in the game"></p>
<h3 id="7-success-attracts-talent">7. Success Attracts Talent</h3>
<p>Finally, <strong>keep moving forward</strong>.</p>
<p>Never use your lack of technical skill as a reason not to move your startup forward. The longer you stick with it, the more you’ll learn, and the more likely you are to find a level of success that becomes attractive to a technical co-founder.</p>
<p>Whether you measure your startup’s success by fundraising, revenue, or users, find a way to move your key metrics forward until your future CTO can’t ignore you.</p>

Delivery.</p><p><a href="https://services.google.com/fh/files/misc/state-of-devops-2019.pdf#page=21" target="_blank"><strong>The best teams deliver</strong></a><strong>. The worst teams don't.</strong></p><p>The best teams take calculated efforts to improve delivery while the worst are content maintaining the status quo.</p><p>The worst teams hide behind technical debt, execs that 'don't understand', or fairy tales like 'our product is unique' and 'our teams work differently'.</p><p>But the reality is these are just excuses (<a href="https://services.google.com/fh/files/misc/state-of-devops-2019.pdf#page=32" target="_blank">with very few exceptions</a>).</p><p>‍</p><h2>Why does delivery matter?</h2><p>‍</p><h3><strong>1)&nbsp;Delivery affects the entire business.</strong></h3><p>Studies show <a href="https://services.google.com/fh/files/misc/state-of-devops-2018.pdf#page=24" target="_blank">engineering success is highly correlated company success</a> across profitability, market share, and customer satisfaction. This is further backed by Marc Andreessen who states: </p><p><a href="https://a16z.com/2014/06/03/pmarca-tweetstorm-cycle-time-determines-winners-and-losers-in-tech/" target="_blank"><strong>"Cycle Time (delivery speed)&nbsp;compression determines winners &amp; losers in tech".</strong><br></a></p><p>Which makes sense because better delivery brings more value to customers, which in turn brings more revenue. Faster delivery means faster experimentation, value to customers, and gets you faster feedback so you don't waste time building the wrong thing.</p><p>Of course there are things like quality, stability, etc but it all equates back to delivery.</p><p>‍<strong>Deploying quality code, quickly.</strong></p><p>‍</p><h3>2)&nbsp;Developers like to deliver.</h3><p><a href="https://www.devopsgroup.com/blog/why-change-deployment-frequency-results-in-big-gains/" target="_blank"><strong>Developers who deploy more tend to be happier</strong></a><strong>, more productive.</strong></p><p>Which makes sense when you think about a team who struggles with tech debt, complex workloads, unplanned tickets, context switching.</p><p>They aren't able to deliver.</p><p>And that sucks.</p><p>Meanwhile, the team who focuses on delivery invests in removing bottlenecks. Getting their team back to doing what they love - deploying value to customers.</p><p>‍</p><h3>3)&nbsp;It's a fundamental outcome for success.</h3><p><strong>If you're not focused on delivering, then what are you focused on?</strong></p><p>Now you may say 'I don't care about delivery', which fine. But that's like a company saying 'we don't care about revenue'. Sure, you can get away with it but you'll end up in a really bad spot if you don't know your fundamentals.</p><p>At the end of the day, if you focus on delivery then everything else (tech debt, process changes, resourcing) will fall right into place.</p><p>‍</p><h2>How well does your team deliver?</h2><p><a href="https://www.usehaystack.io/create-account" target="_blank">Sign up</a> for Haystack and see how your delivery stacks up.

<p>Isaac Mosquera, our co-founder, CTO, as well as a member of the Spinnaker Steering committee, recently shared a post diving into the details of Spinnaker’s new Vision and Mission. The Spinnaker community developed both the Vision and the Mission as a combined effort between the Steering Committee and the Technical Oversight Committee with the goal of aligning on a vision and mission statement for the Spinnaker project.</p>
<p>As passionate members of the Spinnaker community, we are very excited to see the community develop a long term Mission and Vision statement.&nbsp; These statements will serve as the foundation of the Spinnaker project and will be built upon in an iterative fashion.</p>
<blockquote>
<p data-selectable-paragraph=""><strong>By productizing software delivery practices, opinions, and techniques based on broad industry standards, we can simplify that complexity. We envision a safe, secure, compliant workflow that encompasses the entire lifecycle of software delivery from development to production.</strong></p>

		<span>Thingamagig is a Raspberry Pi-based, voice-controllable, IoT multi-effects processor and jam-along automation hub for electric guitar. I began building it in July 2019 and it’s now available for purchase on Amazon as of a couple of weeks ago.</span>
	</p>
	<p>
		<span>As </span><span><a href="https://thingamagig.com/story.html">you may recall</a></span><span>, this entire project began from a desire to add extreme automation to the at-home guitar playing experience - the ability to quickly and easily play famous covers without all the friction of amps, pedals, knobs, switches and presets.</span>
	</p>
	<p>
		<span>What’s the main innovation? </span><span>Thingamagig knows the musical composition itself.</span><span>&nbsp;Thus, during playback, it can manipulate and automate:</span>
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li><span>tones, crafted by a studio engineer and loaded from a central repository</span></li>
		<li><span>effects and loopers</span></li>
		<li><span>tempo, key and mix</span></li>
		<li><span>lyrics/chords (scrolling on screen in perfect time)</span></li>
		<li><span>external MI (guitars, vocal effects, etc)</span></li>
		<li><span>and especially </span><span><a href="https://youtu.be/OEPoqMXZWQI">coordinated lighting as seen in this prototype video</a></span></li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		<span>While </span><span>the last two bullets didn't make the MVP cut due to cost and complexity, the first 4 did, and combined with an Alexa interface (instant song call-up and guitarists’ hands are usually busy), I’m proud of the result. I love to play it and believe other people will, too. </span>
	</p>
	<p>
		<span>Let me know what you think in the HN comments.</span>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article role="main">
        <p>Last month, <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/a-byzantine-failure-in-the-real-world/">Cloudflare published a postmortem</a> of a recent 6-hour outage caused by a partial switch failure which left <a href="https://etcd.io/">etcd</a> unavailable as it was unable to establish a stable leader. This outage has understandably led to <a href="https://twitter.com/heidiann360/status/1332711011451867139">discussion online</a> about exactly what liveness guarantees are provided by the <a href="https://raft.github.io/">Raft</a> consensus algorithm in the face of network failures.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://raft.github.io/raft.pdf">original Raft paper</a> makes the following claim:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>[Consensus algorithms] are fully functional (available) as long as any majority of the servers are operational and can communicate with each other and with clients.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This statement implies that consensus algorithms such as Raft should tolerate network failures (also known as <a href="https://decentralizedthoughts.github.io/2019-06-07-modeling-the-adversary/">omission faults</a>) as long as they do not impact communication between the majority of servers.
In this post, we will consider whether Raft can guarantee liveness, and specifically whether it can establish a stable leader, if a network fault means that some servers are no longer connected to each other.</p>

<h2 id="does-raft-guarantee-liveness-in-the-presence-of-network-failures">Does Raft guarantee liveness in the presence of network failures?</h2>

<p>Unfortunately, Raft, as described in the original paper, does not guarantee liveness in all such cases. Consider the following example.</p>

<p>We have 5 servers and servers 1, 2, and 3 are connected to each other. Server 4 is only connected to server 2 and server 5 is only connected to server 3. Initially, server 3 is the leader. Server 4 is not connected to the leader so it will timeout, increment its term and send a RequestVote RPC to server 2. Server 2 will update its term and then force server 3 to do the same and thus step down. Eventually, a new leader will be elected (either server 1, 2, or 3) but either server 4 or server 5 (or both) will not be connected to the leader and thus will timeout, updating its term and forcing the leader to step down. This system will not be able to establish a stable leader.</p>

<figure>
  <img src="https://decentralizedthoughts.github.io/uploads/RAFT%201.jpg" width="80%">
  <figcaption><center>Partially connected servers 4 and 5 constantly interrupt the elected leader.</center></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>In order to guarantee liveness, Raft must ensure that if a leader is up and connected to a majority of responding servers then it will not be forced to step down. Fortunately, section 9.6 of <a href="https://web.stanford.edu/~ouster/cgi-bin/papers/OngaroPhD.pdf">Diego Ongaro’s thesis</a> suggests how this can be achieved using <strong>PreVote</strong>. PreVote requires potential candidates to run a trial election to test if they can win an election before incrementing their term and running a normal election using RequestVote. A server only pre-votes for a potential candidate during the PreVote phase if it would vote for it during a normal election, and importantly, if it has not received an AppendEntries RPC from the leader with in the election timeout. PreVote fixes the problem have we described as servers 4 and 5 will not update their terms as they will not receive pre-votes from the majority of servers.</p>

<p>An alternative fix is to require servers to ignore RequestVote RPCs if they have received an AppendEntries RPC from the leader within the election timeout. This was suggested in section 6 in the <a href="https://raft.github.io/raft.pdf">Raft paper</a> as mitigation for liveness issues during reconfiguration. However, we will focus on PreVote instead.</p>

<h2 id="so-does-raft-with-prevote-guarantee-liveness-then">So, does Raft with PreVote guarantee liveness then?</h2>

<p>Unfortunately not. In fact, PreVote introduces new liveness issues to Raft. Consider the following example. We have 5 servers and servers 1, 2, and 3 are connected to each other. Server 4 is connected only to server 2 and server 5 has failed.</p>

<p>Initially, server 4 is the leader. It was elected before its links to the other servers (except server 2) failed. Server 4 is now unable to make progress as it is not connected to a majority of servers. Servers 1 and 3 will not hear from the leader so they will timeout and begin the PreVote phase. Neither server will complete its PreVote phase as server 2 will not pre-vote for either server as it still receives regular AppendEntries from the leader (server 4). This system will not able to elect a new leader and the old leader will not be able to make progress.</p>

<figure>
  <img src="https://decentralizedthoughts.github.io/uploads/RAFT%202.jpg" width="80%">
  <figcaption><center>The leader, Server 4, suffers partial network faults but does not step down. Server 2 does not timeout, severs 1 and 3 will fail PreVote because of server 2.</center></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>This can be addressed by requiring leaders to actively step down if they do not receive AppendEntries responses from a majority of servers. This optimisation is sometimes referred to as CheckQuourm and related matters are mentioned in section 6.2 of <a href="https://web.stanford.edu/~ouster/cgi-bin/papers/OngaroPhD.pdf">Ongaro’s thesis</a> and in <a href="https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/issues/3866">raft discussions</a>.</p>

<h2 id="does-raft-with-prevote-and-checkquorum-guarantee-liveness">Does Raft with PreVote and CheckQuorum guarantee liveness?</h2>

<p>Yes. If there is no leader, then an election (or series of elections) will occur and eventually, a server will be elected leader. To be elected leader, the server must be connected to a majority of servers as it received votes from a majority of servers in the PreVote and RequestVote phases.</p>

<p>CheckQuorum ensures that if the elected leader is no longer connected to a majority of responding servers, it will step down and allow a new leader to be elected.</p>

<p>There will always be at least one server that can win an election. This is the server (or servers) with the most up-to-date log (logs) within the subset of servers which are all online and connected to a majority of responding servers. PreVote ensures that once a leader from this set has been elected, the system will be stable as it will not be forced to step down.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                  <article>
                    
                  <p><img src="https://chaordic-public.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/images/lambda-k8s.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Serverless or Kubernetes? The <em>“TL;DR”</em> answer to the question is, <em>“it depends”</em>. The longer answer is, it depends on a number of factors, which we will try to address in this article.</p>
<h4 id="why-not-just-on-premise-bare-metal-or-vm-servers">Why not just on-premise, bare-metal or VM servers?</h4>
<p>If your organisation is just running a single monolithic legacy application built by a single team, there is probably nothing wrong with bare-metal or VM’s. Many teams will invoke this rationale for keeping the Status Quo. But, unless you work for a small, single product company with just one small development team, this is likely not valid.</p>
<p>Most organisations will have more than one team, more than one piece of software that they deploy. The rationale of a single team or multiple isolated teams should therefore not dictate what makes sense for the entire organisation. If you have multiple teams or multiple applications/services, moving to either Serverless or Kubernetes will start to make sense for a number of reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>Standardising deployment technology (lowers development cost).</li>
<li>Automating infrastructure management (lowers operational cost).</li>
<li>Shifting operational work to service providers (such as AWS, Google or Azure, further lowering operational costs &amp; risks).</li>
<li>Shifting capital expenditure to operational expenditure (pay-as-you-go vs upfront investment).</li>
<li>Improved resource utilisation by not paying for idle servers.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are two additional considerations when shifting from “legacy” models of working. Firstly, there will be some retraining of internal staff on-the-job. Any change in technology requires up-skilling. The other side of this is recruitment should become easier: as you standardise on technologies that are widely used in the market, the pool from which you can draw skilled individuals become bigger. And it naturally follows that onboarding new employees becomes cheaper and faster.</p>
<h4 id="when-should-we-use-serverless-instead-of-kubernetes">When should we use Serverless instead of Kubernetes?</h4>
<p>We will preface our recommendation here with this:</p>
<p>We would suggest using Serverless in every use-case, which does not strictly fit the criteria of using something else. When circumstances do not push us strongly away from Serverless, as described in the Kubernetes section, we believe the benefits heavily outweigh the drawbacks.</p>
<p>We would also state that this recommendation specifically holds true for the Amazon Web Services flavour of Serverless. While Azure and Google Cloud also have Serverless offerings as of this being written in late 2020, the AWS offering has a higher level of maturity, combined with the breadth of functionality to implement almost any kind of system imaginable.</p>
<p>We see five specific motivations making Serverless a good option:</p>
<h5 id="time-to-market-is-a-priority">Time-to-market is a priority</h5>
<p>You want to enable developers to iterate quickly and focus on putting new and improved functionality in front of users without being constrained by access to environments or infrastructure. Once past the initial learning curve, the productivity of a FaaS approach is quite impressive. Further, if you follow our <a href="https://chaordic.io/blog/serverless-distributed-system-productivity/">five practices for Serverless productivity</a>, the cycle from code change to change deployed in an environment can be near instantaneous.</p>
<h5 id="you-want-to-shift-operational-effort-to-enabling-business-innovation">You want to shift operational effort to enabling business innovation</h5>
<p>Good DevOps skills are hard to come by. Serverless does not eliminate the need for it either. We still need these skills for CI/CD automation, observability, security and setting system constraints. But since we no longer need to babysit resources such as disks, servers or networks, the effort is significantly reduced. This allows us to better put to use the skills and people we already have - their efforts will be shifted from fire-fighting and operations to enabling business &amp; developer productivity.</p>
<h5 id="your-use-case-translates-well-to-being-implemented-using-faas--an-event-driven-approach">Your use-case translates well to being implemented using FaaS &amp; an event-driven approach</h5>
<p>An absolute pre-requisite is that your system can be implemented with stateless functions with an event-driven approach. Outside of a small number of use-cases, this should generally not be a problem for any modern system.</p>
<h5 id="you-prefer-operational-cost-scaling-with-use--utility-0-use--0-cost">You prefer operational cost scaling with use &amp; utility: 0 use = $0 cost</h5>
<p>Especially for startups and new products in established companies, the near 0 cost of unused Serverless code is very appealing. No need to sweat about wasting money on running infrastructure for code that may not be used, nor if there is a sudden surge in popularity.</p>
<h5 id="your-system-has-an-unpredictable-load-profile">Your system has an unpredictable load profile</h5>
<p>Capacity planning is difficult and either takes great effort, or devolves to guesswork. Serverless removes 90% of the need for this.</p>
<p>The elastic scaling means we primarily need to concern ourselves with the provisioned quotas of our system for the various services we use. While still technically capacity planning, and not quite the “unlimited scalability” promised by some Serverless proponents, it is very close. Some educated guesses and back-of-the-envelope calculations will ensure you have the right quotas set. This is much easier than trying to size Kubernetes clusters correctly with number of nodes, node sizing, disks etc, not to mention that you still won’t pay much at all for any excess capacity you may have provisioned.</p>
<p>With near infinite elastic scaling and close to 0 overhead cost, you can sleep easier at night.</p>
<h4 id="when-should-we-use-kubernetes-instead-of-serverless">When should we use Kubernetes instead of Serverless?</h4>
<h5 id="you-are-building-stateful-components">You are building stateful components</h5>
<p>If your system is made up of stateful components, for instance in-memory caches and other type of services that rely on some internal state, they are unsuitable to be built as Serverless functions. FaaS requires a heavy emphasis on stateless services/functions.</p>
<h5 id="you-have-long-running-tasks">You have long running tasks</h5>
<p>AWS lambda has an upper limit of 15 minutes runtime, after that a function will be terminated whether it is done or not. If you have long running batch-job type tasks, Serverless may be entirely unsuitable. Likewise, even if it is possible to break down a job into smaller parts that fit within the constraints, the data-transport cost (in time, and money) may exceed any benefit from running Serverless.</p>
<h5 id="your-system-has-real-time-or-low-latency-requirements">Your system has real-time or low-latency requirements</h5>
<p>You do not have control of the infrastructure, the precise resource allocation provided, or even concurrency in a Serverless model. If your system has real-time, or very low-latency requirements, non-Serverless solutions are preferable. Many are likely going to say <em>“we want low latency!"</em>, but this does not automatically mean Serverless is unsuitable. Serverless can be very fast, but, if consistent &lt;50ms response times for API’s are business critical, Serverless is not suitable. There are however very few cases in real life where &lt;50ms response times are crucial, and I’d venture a guess in many existing systems, those sort of response times are also the exception rather than the norm. As a side note, if requirements are truly real-time, this is an indicator your system may be more suited for running on bare-metal.</p>
<h5 id="for-existing-systems-which-are-not-easily-migrated-to-serverless">For existing systems, which are not easily migrated to Serverless</h5>
<p>It is often easier to “lift-and-shift” systems in their entirety by putting them in Docker containers. If a service is truly stateless, it may be possible to work around this particular issue by the use of so called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shim_(computing)">“shims”</a>, which wrap the API’s of the libraries the existing system uses. Shims may be useful even with Greenfield Serverless projects, in order to reduce vendor lock-in and keep the target runtime flexible.</p>
<p>Existing systems that are not easily migrated, are highly likely to fit one of the previous three criteria mentioned.</p>
<h5 id="your-system-has-even-predictable--high-load-over-time">Your system has even, predictable &amp; high load over time</h5>
<p>While Serverless gives you the ability for elastic scaling and costs that scale with the utility of the system, it is not necessarily cheaper under all circumstances. If you have a high and predictably even load 24/7/365, running on Kubernetes or traditional infrastructure may actually be cheaper.</p>
<p>If we inspect the concept of “even” load, we quickly notice that this is actually rarely the case with most systems. Business applications have peaks during office hours. eCommerce might peak during busy holiday periods. Trading system loads are highly coupled to trading hours, with open and close particularly peaky. Finally, it may turn out the direct cost of Serverless is higher than Kubernetes, but this may still be offset by lower operational costs in human effort.</p>
<h4 id="what-about-vendor-lock-in">What about vendor lock-in?</h4>
<p>We have made a pretty firm recommendation on AWS Serverless, IF you decide to go Serverless. But what about vendor lock-in? Is this not a genuine concern?</p>
<p>Yes, but one that is often overblown. Firstly, as we mentioned, the lock-in can be reduced with the use of shims. Your application code should not be littered with AWS libraries. Ideally references to AWS code should be isolated behind shim/facade libraries. The availability of open source shims for many popular languages and libraries is also growing.</p>
<p>Secondly, vendor lock-in is everywhere we look in IT: If you use Java or the JVM, you are tied to the future whims of Oracle. If you use Golang, it’s Google. If you choose Kubernetes, Google, Red Hat and a few other vendors have an outsized influence. Whether you pay those vendors or not, there is a web of vendor lock-in around almost every IT decision you have ever made.</p>
<p>Furthermore, given competition in the space, what you pay today is likely the most you will ever pay. With Azure, GCP and other breathing down the neck of AWS, they are in no position to indiscriminately hike prices. If they do, someone else will swoop in and eat their lunch. AWS are under more competitive pressure in 2020 than they were in 2010. It is unlikely to ease anytime soon. The pressures of commoditisation are real.</p>
<h4 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h4>
<p>As we have mentioned in a <a href="https://chaordic.io/blog/from-punch-cards-to-serverless/">previous post</a>, we believe Serverless &amp; Kubernetes will live side-by-side in the future, with the lines blurring over time.</p>
<p>Things change quickly: in 2018, AWS Serverless was not yet ready for prime-time other …</p></article></div></div>

                    <p>An excellent code report efficiently evaluates the codebase's quality in terms of code cleanness, and identifies areas to be improved. It should also take special considerations about the reader since a report that's difficult to understand or too long, becomes a pain to read and is not useful.</p><p>This is why we approach our code reports with a top-down perspective, starting with higher-level descriptions of the system and eventually leading down to lower-level discussions at code level. We begin with a functional description of the system and provide a high-level explanation of its architecture to give context to the reader. Then comes a description of the design, stating why things are organized the way they are, with a brief discussion on tradeoffs that lead to it. Finally, critiques to code quality, considering best practices and principles follow.</p><p>This "top-down" approach is also known as the "newspaper metaphor" in Robert C. Martin's book: Clean Code. This book lays the foundation of our best practices guidelines and principles covering all the way, from design patterns, to how to name variables.</p><p>Now without further ado, we'll describe what we look for regarding the different aspects of a codebase.</p><h2 id="architecture">Architecture</h2><p>Even though the primary purpose of assessing the system's architecture is to give context to the reader of the code report, it can also be a great time to re-evaluate it given current business needs.</p><ul><li>Does the architecture support the most needed software quality attributes at the time? For example, in high growth times, it would be a good idea to have good scalability and extensibility.</li><li>Is the architecture simple enough, or is it over-engineered? This can also be seen as the average time needed by a new developer to understand the current architecture.</li></ul><figure><img src="https://hackernoon.com/hn-images/1*1ceZ3tCVJ-iRyS7B2THn7Q.png" alt="over-engineering "><figcaption>An over engineered solution...</figcaption></figure><h2 id="design">Design</h2><p>Like it happens with architecture, we mainly tackle design as an introduction to lower level aspects of the codebase. However, this also proves to be a perfect moment to evaluate the system's design on current business needs.</p><ul><li>Is there room for change in areas that may be subject to change in the future?</li><li>How change within a particular portion of the codebase affects it?</li><li>How hard is it to extend current functionality? Can it be done without modifying the existing code?</li><li>Is it simple enough, or is it over-engineered? Can a new developer understand it relatively quick enough?</li></ul><p>To evaluate this as well as the remaining aspects of the code, we rely on the <em>Clean Code's</em> <strong><em>SOLID</em></strong> principles:</p><ul><li><strong>Single Responsibility Principle</strong>: every unit of code should have one and only one responsibility (it can also be thought of as having just one reason to change). This leads to more testable, readable, and maintainable code.</li><li><strong>Open Closed Principle</strong>: software entities should be open for extension but closed for modification. This allows for a piece of code to be extended (to have added functionality), without affecting existing code, which naturally leads to better extensibility of the codebase.</li><li><strong>Liskov Substitution Principle</strong>: a piece of code using a type high in an inheritance hierarchy should be able to support using a subtype within that hierarchy without altering desirable properties of that code (correctness, completeness, etc.). This one is especially suited for Object-Oriented designs as it helps evaluate whether a type hierarchy is correctly built and whether the code that it uses is generic enough.</li><li><strong>Interface Segregation Principle</strong>: no piece of code should depend on another piece that it does not use. This principle helps trim unnecessary dependencies.</li><li><strong>Dependency Inversion Principle</strong>: high-level entities should not depend upon lower-level entities; they should both depend upon abstractions. This intends to prevent implementation details that are subject to change in the future (thus impacting software) from guiding how software is made.</li></ul><h2 id="the-code-itself">The Code Itself</h2><p>Finally, we move on to the lowest level of our top-down approach: the code itself. Here we look at how different inherent attributes of the code affect its cleanness, and what do we mean by it.</p><p>For the following portion, all aspects are graded with an arbitrary scale -in our case a number from 1 to 10- coinciding with how much the codebase agrees with each criterion we define for each category.</p><p><em>We understand that the grading system has some subjectivity level. Still, we also believe that it is impossible to build an absolute grading system for software as there are many variables to be taken into account when grading.</em></p><h3 id="complexity">Complexity</h3><p>In terms of complexity, we seek the code to be simple enough to be read as <em>prose</em>, and its control flow is easy to follow.

<p><em>As companies increasingly leverage data to power digital products, drive decision making, and fuel innovation, understanding the health and reliability of these most critical assets is fundamental. For decades, organizations have relied on data catalogs to power data governance. But is that enough?&nbsp;</em></p>



<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/debashis1saha" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Debashis Saha</em></a><em>, VP, Engineering at AppZen, formerly at eBay and Intuit, and </em><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/barrmoses" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Barr Moses</em></a><em>, CEO and Co-founder of Monte Carlo, discuss why data catalogs aren’t meeting the needs of the modern data stack, and how a new approach – data discovery – is needed to better facilitate metadata management and data reliability.</em> </p>



<p><em><strong>Interested in learning more about Monte Carlo’s approach to data catalogs and metadata management? <a aria-label="Request a demo (opens in a new tab)" href="https://marketing417822.typeform.com/to/D11gk1a6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Request a demo</a>.</strong></em></p>



<p>It’s no secret: knowing where your data lives and who has access to it is fundamental to understanding its impact on your business. In fact, when it comes to building <a href="https://www.montecarlodata.com/how-to-build-your-data-platform-like-a-product/">a successful data platform</a>, it’s critical that your data is both organized and centralized, while also easily discoverable.</p>



<p>Analogous to a physical library catalog, <a href="https://cloud.google.com/data-catalog" target="_blank" rel="noopener">data catalogs</a> serve as an inventory of metadata and give users the information necessary to evaluate data accessibility, health, and location. In our age of <a href="https://searchbusinessanalytics.techtarget.com/definition/self-service-business-intelligence-BI" target="_blank" rel="noopener">self-service business intelligence</a>, data catalogs have also emerged as a powerful tool for data management and data governance.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Not surprisingly, for most data leaders, one of their first imperatives is to build a data catalog.&nbsp;</p>



<p>At the bare minimum, a data catalog should answer:&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li>Where should I look for my data?&nbsp;</li><li>Does this data matter?&nbsp;</li><li>What does this data represent?</li><li>Is this data relevant and important?&nbsp;</li><li>How can I use this data?&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>Still, as data operations mature and data pipelines become increasingly complex, traditional data catalogs often fall short of meeting these requirements.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Here’s why some of the best data engineering teams are innovating their approach to metadata management – and what they’re doing instead:</p>



<h3>Where data catalogs fall short</h3>



<p>While data catalogs have the ability to document data, the fundamental challenge of allowing users to “discover” and glean meaningful, real-time insights about the health of your data has largely remained unsolved.</p>



<p>Data catalogs as we know them are unable to keep pace with this new reality for three primary reasons: (1) lack of automation, (2) inability to scale with the growth and diversity of your data stack, and (3) their undistributed format.&nbsp;</p>



<h4>Increased need for automation</h4>



<p>Traditional data catalogs and governance methodologies typically rely on data teams to do the heavy lifting of manual data entry, holding them responsible for updating the catalog as data assets evolve. This approach is not only time-intensive, but requires significant manual toil that could otherwise be automated, freeing time up for data engineers and analysts to focus on projects that actually move the needle.</p>



<p>As a data professional, understanding the state of your data is a constant battle and speaks to the need for greater, more customized automation. Perhaps this scenario rings a bell:&nbsp;</p>



<p>Before stakeholder meetings, do you often find yourself frantically pinging Slack channels to figure out what data sets feed a specific report or model you are using – and why on earth the data stopped arriving last week? To cope with this, do you and your team huddle together in a room and start whiteboarding all of the various connections upstream and downstream for a specific key report?&nbsp;</p>



<p>I’ll spare you the gory details, but it probably looked something like this:</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/ph5m59aRfL8owiafVZisgcTG1f0-zrOXWZObUv243HS9i3Gb1uSXXEv9bWOmROiTV8cL2GhNivW5hk8P9SQG3v6NploRM15l7f9s5R6xfbIBxAjPvHCLteV65jQqhhOcT8aXDD0Z" alt="" width="800" height="497"><figcaption><em>Does your data lineage look like a storm of lines and arrows? That makes two (hundred) of us. Image courtesy of <a href="http://www.shutterstock.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Shutterstock</a>.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>If this hits home, you’re not alone. Many companies that need to solve this dependency jigsaw puzzle embark on a multi-year process to manually map out all their data assets. Some are able to dedicate resources to build short-term hacks or even in-house tools that allow them to search and explore their data. Even if it gets you to the end goal, this poses a heavy burden on the data organization, costing your data engineering team time and money that could have been spent on other things, like product development or actually using the data.&nbsp;</p>



<h4>Ability to scale as data changes</h4>



<p>Data catalogs work well when data is structured, but in 2020, that’s not always the case. As machine-generated data increases and companies invest in ML initiatives, unstructured data is becoming more and more common, accounting for <a href="https://www.cio.com/article/3406806/ai-unleashes-the-power-of-unstructured-data.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">over 90 percent of all new data produced</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-build-your-data-platform-choosing-a-cloud-data-warehouse-3de66862f41c" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Typically stored in data lakes</a>, unstructured data does not have a predefined model and must go through multiple transformations to be usable and useful. Unstructured data is very dynamic, with its shape, source, and meaning changing all the time as it goes through various phases of processing, including transformation, modeling, and aggregation. What we do with this unstructured data (i.e., transform, model, aggregate, and visualize it), makes it much more difficult to catalog in its “desired state.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>On top of this, rather than simply <em>describing</em> the data that consumers access and use, there’s a growing need to also <em>understand</em> the data based on its intention and purpose. How a producer of data might describe an asset would be very different from how a consumer of this data understands its function, and even between one consumer of data to another there might be a vast difference in terms of understanding the meaning ascribed to the data.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For instance, a data set pulled from Salesforce has a completely different meaning to a data engineer than it would to someone on the sales team. While the engineer would understand what “DW_7_V3” means, the sales team would be scratching their heads, trying to determine if said data set correlated to their “Revenue Forecasts 2021” dashboard in Salesforce. And the list goes on.</p>



<p>Static data descriptions are limited by nature. In 2021, we must accept and adapt to these new and evolving dynamics to truly understand the data.&nbsp;</p>



<h4>Data is distributed; catalogs are not&nbsp;&nbsp;</h4>



<p>Despite the distribution of the modern data architecture (see: <a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/what-is-a-data-mesh-and-how-not-to-mesh-it-up-210710bb41e0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the data mesh</a>) and the move towards embracing semi-structured and unstructured data as the norm, most data catalogs still treat data like a one-dimensional entity. As data is aggregated and transformed, it flows through different elements of the data stack, making it nearly impossible to document.&nbsp;</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://314eeh1sonxi1dnazoipvkl6-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image3.png" alt="" width="623" height="482" srcset="https://314eeh1sonxi1dnazoipvkl6-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image3.png 623w, https://314eeh1sonxi1dnazoipvkl6-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image3-300x232.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 623px) 100vw, 623px"><figcaption><em>Traditional data catalogs manage metadata (data about your data) at the ingest state, but data is constantly changing, making it hard to understand the health of your data as it evolves in the pipeline. Image courtesy of Barr Moses.</em></figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Nowadays, data tends to be <a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/information-technology/glossary/self-describing-messages#:~:text=A%20message%20that%20contains%20data,consists%20of%20tag%2Fvalue%20pairs." target="_blank" rel="noopener">self-describing</a>, containing both the data and the metadata that describes the format and meaning of that data in a single package.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Since traditional data catalogs are not distributed, it’s near to impossible to use as a central source of truth about your data. This problem will only grow as data becomes more accessible to a wider variety of users, from BI analysts to operations teams, and the pipelines powering ML, operations, and analytics become increasingly complex.</p>



<p>A modern data catalog needs to federate the meaning of data across these domains. Data teams need to be able to understand how these data domains relate to each other and what aspects of the aggregate view are important. They need a centralized way to answer these distributed questions as a whole – in other words, a distributed, federated data catalog.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Investing in the right approach to building a data catalog from the outset will allow you to build a better data platform that helps your team democratize and easily explore data, allowing you to keep tabs on important data assets and harness their full potential.</p>



<h3>Data Catalog 2.0 = Data Discovery</h3>



<p>Data catalogs work well when you have rigid models, but as data pipelines grow increasingly complex and unstructured data becomes the golden standard, our understanding of this data (what it does, who uses it, how it’s used, etc.) does not reflect reality.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We believe that next generation catalogs will have the capabilities to learn, understand, and infer the data, enabling users to leverage its insights in a self-service manner. But how do we get there?&nbsp;</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://314eeh1sonxi1dnazoipvkl6-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image5.png" alt="" width="624" height="486" srcset="https://314eeh1sonxi1dnazoipvkl6-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image5.png 624w, https://314eeh1sonxi1dnazoipvkl6-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image5-300x234.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 624px) 100vw, 624px"><figcaption><em>Data discovery can replace the modern data catalog by providing distributed, real-time insights about data across different domains, all while abiding by a central set of governance standards.&nbsp;</em> Image courtesy of Barr Moses.</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>In addition to cataloging data, metadata and data management strategies must also incorporate data discovery, a new approach to understanding the health of your distributed data assets in real-time. Borrowing from the distributed domain-oriented architecture proposed by Zhamak Deghani and Thoughtworks’ <a href="https://martinfowler.com/articles/data-monolith-to-mesh.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>data mesh model</strong>,</a> data discovery posits that different data owners are held accountable for their data as products, as well as for facilitating communication between distributed data across different locations. Once data has been served to and transformed by a given domain, the domain data owners can leverage the data for their operational or analytic needs.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Data discovery replaces the need for a data catalog by providing a domain-specific, dynamic understanding of your data based on how it’s being ingested, stored, aggregated, and used by a set of specific consumers. As with a data catalog, governance standards and tooling are federated across these domains (allowing for greater accessibility and interoperability), but unlike a data catalog, data discovery surfaces a real-time understanding of the data’s current state as opposed to it’s ideal or “cataloged” state.</p>



<p>Data discovery can answer these questions not just for the data’s ideal state but for the current state of the data across each domain:&nbsp;</p>

  <p><span>15 Nov 2020</span></p><p>This post is a reflection on being part of making a maturing infrastructure organization for nearly five years.</p>

<p>When I joined Production Engineering at Shopify, it was barely 30 people. We went for a team dinner around that time and I remember how my manager paid for it with his credit card because points. Now we are at &gt;200 people, and at the last pre-pandemic offsite we had a huge ballroom booked for the dinner. Clearly it wasn’t billed to an individual’s credit card.</p>

<p>Through my there years there, I’ve seen how we’ve solved scalability and growth by introducing boundaries and new levels of abstraction.</p>

<p>Now that I’m noticing this pattern at other companies too, I believe that managing layers of abstraction is the key tool to solving scalability problems.</p>

<h2 id="the-story-of-scaling-redis">The story of scaling Redis</h2>

<p>As the most of other Ruby on Rails shops, we’ve been running job queues on Redis with the <a href="https://github.com/resque/resque" target="_blank">Resque</a> gem (you might have also worked with Sidekiq which is Resque’s successor). Both of those libraries are built on top of Redis, a key-value database written in C that also provides primitives like List and Hash. As a database, Redis keeps those lists/queues in memory for you, and dumps them to the disk every once in a while if you have persistence enabled.</p>

<p>The way how Resque (or Sidekiq) API is designed, you can grab Redis client by calling <code>Resque.redis</code> and query that Redis directly for any other operations. This is convenient, and having hundreds of developers at Shopify at that point, it was easy for everyone to start dumping non-jobs data to Redis, thanks to the ease of access to <code>Resque.redis</code> in the Rails app.</p>

<p>The side effect of this easy-to-use API was that Redis became overloaded not only by the throughput of background jobs, but also by all arbitrary features where people have plugged <code>Resque.redis</code> to store ephemeral keys like throttles or inventory data.</p>

<p><strong>Lesson #1</strong>: easy to access APIs can get harmful, especially when it’s designed for a smaller scale and misused at a larger scale.</p>

<p>We introduced separate Redis instances for all non-jobs features, and for a while <code>Resque.redis</code> was only used for jobs.</p>

<p><img src="http://kirshatrov.com/assets/post-images/org-layers/v1.png" width="474" alt="VS Code devcontainer feature"></p>

<p>But because <code>Resque.redis</code> didn’t go away as a public API (even though its use was verbally discouraged), a new pile of features have developed that were writing to <code>Resque.redis</code>, mostly because that was a developer habit.</p>

<p>It took us significant amount of efforts to completely remove <code>Resque.redis</code> as a public accessor (see <a href="https://sirupsen.com/shitlists/" target="_blank">shitlist driven development</a>) and move to not exposing Redis clients directly anywhere. Instead of giving Redis access directly, we provide a few Ruby classes that wrap Redis access, like <code>ActiveJob</code>, <code>Throttle</code> or <code>DisposableCounter</code>.</p>

<p><strong>Lesson #2:</strong> it’s going to be much easier to scale a data store when the subset of operations is limited and its clients are not exposed directly to developers.</p>

<h2 id="proxies-and-connection">Proxies and connection</h2>

<p>It’s important to say that <a href="https://redis.io/topics/benchmarks#:~:text=Redis%20is%2C%20mostly%2C%20a%20single,on%20several%20cores%20if%20needed" target="_blank">Redis is single-threaded</a>, which means that it doesn’t employ more than a single CPU. Its authors recommend scaling by introducing more Redis instances running on other CPUs and making your app somehow shard the data across multiple Redis instances - or by using <a href="https://redis.io/topics/cluster-spec" target="_blank">Redis Cluster</a>.</p>

<p>Also, the more client connections are open to Redis, the busier will be that single CPU. We started to notice that connection limits and CPU load were coming to be the two biggest bottlenecks in keeping the platform up.</p>

<p>As we <a href="https://kirshatrov.com/2020/04/27/scaling-mysql-stack-part-4-proxy/" target="_blank">did for the rest of stores</a> like MySQL and memcached, we went with introducing a TCP proxy in front of Redis that would <a href="https://www.percona.com/blog/2019/09/27/multiplexing-mux-in-proxysql/" target="_blank">multiplex</a> client &lt;-&gt; backend connections and reduce the pressure on Redis’ CPU. It’s incredible how much  room you can buy for scalability by putting a proxy in front of Redis/MySQL/memcached.</p>

<h2 id="proxies-and-scalability">Proxies and scalability</h2>

<p>Now all operations to Redis went through a proxy and every feature like jobs or throttles had its own Redis. But every Redis was still single-threaded, and once we had extra load on jobs or on throttles, that Redis would max out on CPU and some operations would get queued and time out. We had to horizontally scale Redis for each feature.</p>

<p>The beauty of having a proxy in front of a database is that you now you can make changes to the backend without having to change clients. Thanks to <a href="https://www.envoyproxy.io/" target="_blank">Envoy proxy</a>, we’ve been able to swap a single Redis behind the proxy with a pool of multiple Redis instances, and partitioning operations by a key.</p>

<p><img src="http://kirshatrov.com/assets/post-images/org-layers/v3.png" width="516" alt="VS Code devcontainer feature"></p>

<h2 id="layers-of-abstraction">Layers of abstraction</h2>

<p>We’ve had no abstractions at first and developers used to call the Redis client directly for any operations. <strong>We went away from giving the Redis client to providing primitives that work with Redis underneath.</strong></p>

<p>Later we <strong>moved away from making the application connect to Redis directly to giving them something that looks like Redis</strong>, but is actually a proxy that forwards commands to multiple Redis instances managed by infrastructure teams. That abstraction will also allow us to swap those backends on the proxy with another database like <a href="https://keydb.dev/" target="_blank">KeyDB</a> in we wanted to.</p>

<p>These two steps have abstracted Redis access from the application code and decoupled code from the infrastructure, which was the key to making something scale for both the load and the number of developers.</p>

<p>You can see the similar pattern with <a href="https://vitess.io/">Vitess</a>, which makes the client believe that it’s speaking to MySQL while it’s actually speaking to a Go service that applies certain logic and forwards those MySQL queries elsewhere. Used by YouTube, Github and Slack, Vitess is gaining its popularity as a way to horizontally scaling database access without increasing the complexity on the client.</p>

<p>I believe that the increasing amount of abstractions is the reasonable price to pay for scalability. <strong>It works the other way around too</strong>: if some parts of your stack are abstracted and some are not, those that are not abstracted will be the first to become a scalability bottleneck.</p>

<p>14 Dec 2020</p>
<p>Itâ€™s 2020. If you arenâ€™t using a password manager yet, <a href="https://security.stackexchange.com/a/45067/211865" target="_blank">drop everything youâ€™re doing and switch to one</a>.</p>

<p>Using password managers is a <em>very</em> good idea. Up until last year, I was using Chromeâ€™s password manager, and it worked well, for the most part. However, I wanted something more dedicated, since I had started to see obvious issues with it (no concept of â€œmasterâ€� password, no special characters in password generators, no cross platform support, etc.). I searched around for password managers, and most reviews recommended options like Dashlane, 1password, Lastpass, etc. Figuring that there wouldnâ€™t be much difference between these options, I decided to give Dashlane a try. After all, everyone did say â€œyou canâ€™t go wrong with any of theseâ€�. Boy, was I wrong.</p>

<p>The more I used Dashlane, the more puzzled I became at some of the design decisions the company chose to make. I ran into some bugs that are not only deal breakers, but are outright security issues. Since I had paid for a year of Dashlaneâ€™s premium subscription, I decided to give it a chance anyway. After having none of those issues go away after 11 months, I decided to just give up and switch to Bitwarden yesterday. In a couple of hours, all my issues magically went away. Here are my gripes with Dashlane:</p>

<h3 id="dashlanes-autofill-feature">Dashlaneâ€™s Autofill feature</h3>
<p>One of the things that annoyed me the most with Dashlane was the â€œauto loginâ€� feature. If youâ€™re on a websiteâ€™s login page and Dashlane has only one login for that, itâ€™ll simply fill the credentials in, and then <strong><em>click the submit buttom for you</em></strong>. The first time it happened to me I was so confused I had no idea what happened. This is just straight up no-no in my books. Software should never do things for you unless you specifically configure it to do that. It should merely suggest and serve helpful suggestions, never do actions on your behalf. Not only that, but:</p>

<ul>
  <li>You canâ€™t click the â€œRemember meâ€� checkbox or interact with the page in any way.</li>
  <li>Some sites have a login page on their home screen, and this feature just makes you jump directly without even asking if you <em>want</em> to log in in the first place.</li>
  <li>Thereâ€™s no global switch to turn off this feature. You literally have to open each password item in the Dashlane app and turn it off. Needless to say, for hundreds of passwords, this feasible at all.</li>
</ul>


<p>Dashlaneâ€™s password fill in popup would just randomly not appear sometimes, both in the extension, and on my Android device, requiring me to open the app and manually copy the password from there. Besides being annoying, this is a very serious security concern, since the only time the password fill in pop up should not appear <a href="https://security.stackexchange.com/a/45067/211865" target="_blank">is when youâ€™re on a phishing site</a>.</p>

<p>I even got phished because of this once. Someone messaged me an invite to their Steam account, but the URL was staemcommunity.us (Notice the â€˜aâ€™ and â€˜eâ€™ flipped. Also, Steam doesnâ€™t have a .us domain, but it looked official enough for me in that moment). The page was a 1:1 replica of the steam page, and Dashlane refused to show the password popup. Rolling my eyes, I opened the dashlane app, copied my username and password and even submitted the form. Thankfully, the minute I submitted it I realized something was wrong (the page told me that my username/password combo was incorrect, which it couldnâ€™t possibly be), and I figured out I was phished, and changed my credentials quickly. This would have never happened had Dashlaneâ€™s popup been more reliable for me.</p>

<h3 id="no-desktop-app-support-for-linux">No Desktop App support for Linux</h3>
<p>I solely use <a href="https://pop.system76.com/" target="_blank">Pop!OS</a> for everything, including gaming. Imagine my disppointment when I found that Dashlaneâ€™s desktop app only supports Windows and Mac. Without the app, you canâ€™t use Dashlaneâ€™s VPN (why would you pay for premium then?). You also canâ€™t use features like password export.</p>

<p>To shift to Bitwarden, I literally had to download Windows 10, create a virtual machine, install the app, then use the export feature. <em>Why doesnâ€™t the web app have such a basic utility feature?</em></p>

<h3 id="no-ability-to-lock-extension-on-sleep">No ability to lock extension on sleep</h3>
<p>Whenever I lock/put my device to sleep, I want to extension to lock itself too, otherwise there really isnâ€™t any point to having a master password. Dashlane has no such feature. Anyone who can someone get in my machine also suddenly has access to all my passwords. Bitwarden, a free service, has that feature.</p>

<h3 id="broken-password-export">Broken Password Export</h3>
<p>Thankfully, Dashlane offers to export all your stored information in a JSON so you can shift to some other (read: better) password manager. However, after migrating to Bitwarden, I noticed that it wasnâ€™t working well with subdomains. My first instinct was to blame Bitwarden, but upon inspecting the JSON export of my information, I found out that Dashlane had grouped together passwords for all subdomains into the domain. For example, the passwords for <code>abc.example.com</code> and <code>pqr.example.com</code> were stored in the JSON as 2 different passwords for <code>example.com</code>. Morever, none of my â€œSecure Notesâ€� had made it in the export. Iâ€™m going to have to manually spend some time to clean up this mess.</p>

<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>Just use Bitwarden. Itâ€™s free, and the premium plan is 1/5th the price of Dashlane, and it is much more usable and has more features than Dashlane.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Former VP of Growth for Segment and Drift, Guillaume “G” Cabane now advises some of the world’s fastest growing companies (G2, Abstract, Gorgias). His commute may have shortened but his workday has not.<br></p><p>“I am in back-to-back Zoom video calls with seven clients,” says G.&nbsp;<br></p><p>With non-stop Zoom meetings, G doesn’t have time between meetings to organize all of the action items, interesting client remarks, and moments of concern.<strong>‍</strong></p><blockquote><strong>"Listening to every Zoom recording myself is valuable, but painful"</strong></blockquote><p>G explains, “I charge a lot per hour, which means there are high expectations and one of the obvious expectations is ‘G is going to follow up and do the things he’s committed to.’ I commit to a lot of things. I say ‘yes i’ll do that’ or ‘oh, this is a good idea I should follow up on.’”</p><p>Initially, one of the solutions G explored involved his executive assistant reading Zoom call transcripts, taking notes of action items and such, and then creating a report. Yet that proved less than ideal.<br></p><p>“That was problematic because my EA’s time is consumed at the same rate as my time, which isn’t great for her—or for my finances,” says G. “And my EA doesn’t necessarily know the subtleties of what’s going on in my brain such as ‘this moment in the meeting is good to highlight for myself and this other part should be shared with the client.’”&nbsp;<br></p><p>G then tried listening to all of the calls himself.</p><p>“Listening to every Zoom recording myself is valuable, but it’s a painful process,” says G. “I'm going to listen to the call carefully. I'm going to pause the recording. Take notes. I'm going to pause. Take notes. It takes me like two to three times the length of the call to extract all the value and summarize. It’s a painful process. It's slow.”<br></p><p>There’s no other platform that I know of that enables me to—in just a second while talking, right now—take a note and create value in a call with someone.”&nbsp;</p><blockquote>"There’s no other platform that I know of that enables me to—in just a second while talking, right now—take a note and create value in a call with someone.”&nbsp;<br></blockquote><p>In his search for a tool that allows him to “pinpoint key moments of interaction” during calls, G found Grain.</p><p>“The thing I love most about Grain is the ability to quickly take notes during a call. There’s no other platform that I know of that enables me to—in just a second while talking, right now—take a note and create value in a call with someone.”&nbsp;<br></p><p>One of Grain’s early adopters, G developed his own system for quickly taking note of a key moment of interaction in a call—while still remaining engaged with the client. G uses a system of emojis found in the Grain desktop app for noting different types of key moments.&nbsp;<br></p><h5>We asked, and G graciously shared his list of preferred emojis and what they mean:</h5><p>‍</p><figure id="w-node-92bf9eccce02-4dccff3f"></figure><h5>⭐️ - Important moment or statement</h5><h5>🔥 - Good reaction from the client or G</h5><h5>😔 - Something G is concerned about. (G probably won’t share this with the client.)</h5><h5>✅ - Something the client has committed to doing</h5><h5>🚧 - Something G has committed to</h5><h5>💡 - New idea</h5><h5>🛠 - New tool G would like to share with others</h5><h5>🧠 - Summary of the call for his team</h5><p>‍</p><p>‍</p><p>By quickly clicking an emoji, or briefly writing a time-stamped note, G can remain focused on his clients during calls—while his team has a system for easily reviewing all of the key moments after a meeting.<br></p><blockquote>“I’m reaching out because your CEO said this. We should talk.” </blockquote><p>G rarely shares an entire call recording with a client. Instead, he uses Grain’s recording editing capabilities to create a brief video highlight for his client.<br></p><p>“One way I love to share highlights is when the client’s CEO says something important such as “We don’t really do that growth tactic at this company.” He then contacts a VP responsible for that kind of tactic and says “I’m reaching out because your CEO said this. We should talk.” Basically put, G uses Grain’s brief video highlight feature “as a way to move [his] agenda.”<br></p><p>“Grain is hard-coded into my daily system,” says G. “I use Grain in every one of my calls. There’s no way I’m removing Grain. Time-saving 100 percent. Complete empowerment. There’s no way I could manage that number of Zoom calls and different customers without Grain.”</p><p>For highlights of our entire interview with G, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfgVh5rTM54&amp;feature=emb_logo">watch the video here:</a></p><figure id="w-node-268611f559fe-4dccff3f"><p><iframe allowfullscreen="true" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dfgVh5rTM54"></iframe></p></figure><p>‍</p><p>‍<br></p></div></div>]]>

<p>The price of bitcoin is headed back over $19,000 again. What will it take to push it past $20,000—more tethers? More institutional buying? Or maybe, more crypto journalists proclaiming (without evidence) that tethers are fully backed? Here’s the news: </p>



<h2>MicroStrategy wants more, more, more</h2>



<p>Michael Saylor, the new crazy god of bitcoin institutional buying, continues his bitcoin buying spree. He seems really, really confident the price of BTC will go up. </p>



<p>Saylor’s publicly traded company MicroStrategy currently owns 40,824 bitcoins—because no sense using all that excess cash for buying back a ton of stock or paying a big dividend. Better off to gamble it on crypto. </p>



<p>Now the firm is actually going into debt to buy bitcoin. After completing a $650 million bond offering, MicroStrategy plans to plow all the proceeds into buying more bitcoin. (<a href="https://www.microstrategy.com/en/company/company-videos/microstrategy-completes-650-million-offering-of-convertible-senior-notes">Microstrategy PR</a>, <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/microstrategy-completes-650-million-bond-sale-to-finance-next-bitcoin-purchase">Cointelegraph</a>)</p>



<p>Citibank isn’t impressed. Analyst Tyler Radke downgraded MicroStrategy (MSTR) from neutral to sell, calling the recent rally—MSTR went up after its first few BTC buying announcements—”overextended” and a possibly “deal-breaker” for software investors. (<a href="https://www.theblockcrypto.com/linked/87054/citi-microstrategy-stock-downgrade-bitcoin">The Block</a>)</p>



<h2>Tether: Ain’t no stopping us now</h2>



<p>Tether is now at <a href="https://archive.is/wip/aITvG">$20 billion worth of tether</a>—that’s assets, but circulating supply is soon to follow—and there is no evidence whatsoever to conclude that there is $20 billion in real cash behind all those tethers.&nbsp;Why? Because the company has never had a formal audit. &nbsp;</p>



<div><figure><a href="https://amyhcastor.files.wordpress.com/2020/12/piles-of-money.jpg"><img loading="lazy" data-attachment-id="5023" data-permalink="https://amycastor.com/piles-of-money/" data-orig-file="https://amyhcastor.files.wordpress.com/2020/12/piles-of-money.jpg" data-orig-size="600,450" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="piles-of-money" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://amyhcastor.files.wordpress.com/2020/12/piles-of-money.jpg?w=300" data-large-file="https://amyhcastor.files.wordpress.com/2020/12/piles-of-money.jpg?w=600" src="https://amyhcastor.files.wordpress.com/2020/12/piles-of-money.jpg?w=600" alt="" width="384" height="288" srcset="https://amyhcastor.files.wordpress.com/2020/12/piles-of-money.jpg?w=384 384w, https://amyhcastor.files.wordpress.com/2020/12/piles-of-money.jpg?w=150 150w, https://amyhcastor.files.wordpress.com/2020/12/piles-of-money.jpg?w=300 300w, https://amyhcastor.files.wordpress.com/2020/12/piles-of-money.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 384px) 100vw, 384px"></a></figure></div>



<p>Still, last month, The Block’s Larry Cermak <a href="https://twitter.com/ahcastor/status/1338273950078398465">defended tethers</a> as being “either fully backed or very, very close,” telling folks “everything is in order now.” He based that on conversations he claimed to have had with “third-parties” who told him they had successfully redeemed several hundred million in tethers.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Cermak is not the only one to buy the Tether line of B.S. </p>



<p>In December 2018, after <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-12-18/crypto-mystery-clues-suggest-tether-has-the-billions-it-promised">looking at Tether bank statements</a>, Bloomberg’s Matt Leising also reported that Tether appeared to be fully backed. He was wrong.</p>



<p>Unbeknownst to him at the time, in the previous two months, the DOJ froze five NY bank accounts <a href="https://amycastor.com/2019/05/02/the-us-government-wants-man-at-the-center-of-massive-cryptocurrency-scheme-held-without-bail/">belonging to Reginald Fowler</a>, who ran a shadow banking service for Tether/Bitfinex’s Panamanian payment processor. And in November, the NYAG, having serious concerns about Tether’s finances, <a href="https://ag.ny.gov/press-release/2019/attorney-general-james-announces-court-order-against-crypto-currency-company">issued subpoenas to Bitfinex and Tether</a> asking for details on their banking. Finally, in April 2019, Tether admitted it was only <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/tether-lawyer-confirms-stablecoin-74-percent-backed-by-cash-and-equivalents">74% backed</a>. And that’s before it went off and printed another 17.5 billion tethers. So what’s backing all those?  </p>



<p>In a recent <a href="https://davidgerard.co.uk/blockchain/2020/12/13/tether-is-too-big-to-fail-the-entire-crypto-industry-utterly-depends-on-it/">blog post</a>, David Gerard explains why Tether is “too big to fail.” Essentially, it’s keeping the entire BTC market afloat. If Tether were to get the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/29/nyregion/liberty-reserve-operators-accused-of-money-laundering.html">Liberty Reserve treatment</a>, the price of bitcoin is unlikely to ever recover. </p>



<p>Thus, “the purpose of the crypto industry, and all its little service sub-industries, is to generate a narrative—so as to maintain and enhance the flow of actual dollars from suckers, and keep the party going,” he said.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>NYAG: Tether documents forthcoming</h2>



<p>Meanwhile, there’s been a new document filing in the NYAG Tether probe.<a href="https://twitter.com/NewYorkStateAG"> </a></p>



<p>In a <a href="https://iapps.courts.state.ny.us/nyscef/ViewDocument?docIndex=2AsYgvjJAsSdalpfkInbHA==">letter</a> to the Supreme Court, NYAG says Bitfinex/Tether are cooperating on document production and the parties expect to finalize things “in the coming weeks.” These documents, of course, consist of everything NYAG asked for in its original November 2018 subpoena—information that will shed light on the Tether and Bitfinex’s shadowy dealings since 2015. </p>



<p>A part of me wants to get excited about this news, but another part says, wait a minute. In the past when Tether’s operators said they were going to hand documents over, they simply handed over material that was already public information. They also have a <a href="https://amycastor.com/2019/01/17/the-curious-case-of-tether-a-complete-timeline-of-events/">long history</a> of shenanigans, so let’s just wait and see.  </p>



<h2><strong>How to turn USDT into cash&nbsp;</strong></h2>



<p>Jorge Stolfi, a computer scientist from Brazil, shared on <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/Buttcoin/comments/kbf5jj/yes_here_we_are_holy_shit_weve_done_it_our_boi/gfmqa1o/">Reddit</a> a “mainstream theory” on what could be happening behind-the-scenes at Tether—specifically, how Tether’s operators could convert USDT into cash for their own personal use. Remember, this is totally unproven. It is just a theory. (The “triad,” by the way, refers to Tether CSO Phil Potter, CEO and <a href="https://archive.is/DfBMP">man of mystery</a>&nbsp;J.L. van der Velde,&nbsp;and CFO Giancarlo Devasini. They are the same operators behind sister company Bitfinex.)</p>



<p>He writes:</p>



<ol><li>The owners of Tether Inc (which I will call “the Triad”) print billions of USDT without any backing.</li><li>The Triad deposits those USDT into Bitfinex (which they own too).</li><li>The Triad uses those USDT to buy BTC and other cryptos from other Bitfinex clients, attracted by the better price.</li><li>The Triad withdraws the BTC to their private wallets.</li><li>The Triad moves all or some of those BTC to other exchanges that handle real currencies, such as USD, EUR, JPY, etc.</li><li>The Triad sells those BTC for real money.</li><li>The Triad withdraws the real money into their personal bank accounts.</li></ol>



<p>This is a theory. This is not proven. But the point is, when you have no checks and balances in place along with massive loopholes in oversight, <em>anything</em> can happen. We <a href="https://amycastor.com/2019/02/12/how-the-hell-did-we-get-here-a-timeline-of-quadrigacx-events/">saw this</a> already with QuadrigaCX—the Canadian crypto exchange that went bankrupt after the founder disappeared (aka “died in India”), taking along with him hundreds of millions of dollars in customer funds.  </p>



<h2>Coinbase loses half critical security team</h2>



<p>After NYT reporter Nathaniel Popper <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/27/technology/coinbase-cryptocurrency-black-employees.html">reported</a> about discriminatory complaints at Coinbase, <a href="https://twitter.com/nathanielpopper/status/1336072433091059712">new information came out</a>. Among those who recently resigned to protest the exchange’s new internal policies, were four of the seven people on Coinbase’s critical security team—aka the “key management team.” </p>



<figure><div>
<div><blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>New detail on how the turmoil at Coinbase has hit the company's efforts to secure its Bitcoins.</p><p>Among the people who resigned this fall – to protest new internal policies – were 4 of the 7 people on the most critical security team, the "key management team," sources told me.</p></div>— Nathaniel Popper (@nathanielpopper) <a href="https://twitter.com/nathanielpopper/status/1336072433091059712?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 7, 2020</a></blockquote></div>
</div></figure>



<p>The key management team is responsible for securing the cryptographic keys to Coinbase’s cold wallets, where the majority of the company’s crypto is held—somewhere in the neighborhood of $30 billion. </p>



<p>“No job is more fundamental to the company’s success,” Popper said.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Coinbase’s security chief <a href="https://twitter.com/SecurityGuyPhil/status/1336082099376287745">shot back</a>, saying Coinbase’s security team is managed by several teams with redundancy built in. Of course, he wants us to believe everything is fine, but not everyone is convinced. </p>

<h2>MassMutual invests in BTC</h2>



<p>Bitcoin has a new institutional investor: MassMutual. The Springfield-Mass insurance firm purchased $100 million worth of BTC for its general investment account, which totals $235 billion. (<a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/massmutual-joins-the-bitcoin-club-with-100-million-purchase-11607626800">WSJ</a>)</p>



<p>MassMutual purchased the bitcoin through NYDIG, a New York-based fund management company, which has  $2.3 billion worth of crypto under management. MassMutual also acquired a $5 million minority equity stake in NYDIG.</p>



<p>The $100 million cash injection into bitcoin sounds like a lot, but it’s small potatoes. That money will cover the network’s operators—the bitcoin miners—for only six days. Remember, bitcoin miners are selling their 900 newly minted bitcoin per day for $17 million, at current BTC prices. Investors will never see that money again. Bitcoin doesn’t make any real profits on its own—just investor money going in one end, out the other. </p>

        <p>
          This is our final prediction of the solar corona for the December 14, 2020 total solar eclipse.
          This updates our <a href="http://www.predsci.com/corona/dec2020eclipse_prelim">preliminary prediction</a>
          posted on November 23.
          The above images show two versions of the predicted white light brightness in the corona. The
          left image shows an image processed to simulate what would be seen when using a "Newkirk"
          radially graded filter. The image on the right is the brightness on a log scale, sharpened using
          an "Unsharp Mask" filter. These are two different attempts to approximate what the human eye might see
          during the solar eclipse.  
        </p>

        <p>
          The Sun is in the early phase of the new solar cycle, so the solar magnetic field is evolving rapidly.
          The corona's appearance can change significantly in several days, as can be seen by comparing our new 
          prediction (latest magnetic field data on November 29) with our 
          <a href="http://www.predsci.com/corona/dec2020eclipse_prelim">preliminary prediction</a> (latest magnetic field data on November 12).  
          Further changes between November 29 and December 14 are possible (and indeed, likely), making 
          prediction more difficult than at the time of the
          <a href="http://www.predsci.com/corona/jul2019eclipse/home.php">July 2, 2019 eclipse</a>.
        </p>

        <p>
          The image below on the left shows a digital processing of the brightness using a "Wavelet" filter
          to bring out the details in the image. The image on the right shows traces of selected magnetic field lines
          from the model. Additional details about the eclipse and our prediction model are given below.

          These images are aligned so that terrestrial (geocentric) north is up, for the time of totality (16:03 UT)
          near Villarrica, Chile. This is the view of the Sun that would
          be seen by an observer on Earth with a camera aligned so that vertical is toward the Earth's north pole. 
          Because the eclipse will be visible high in the sky in the southern hemisphere, many of the photographs you
          see may have the south pole near vertical instead.
          Here is the <a href="http://www.predsci.com/corona/dec2020eclipse/local_view.php">perspective for a spectator on the ground</a> in 
          Villarrica looking up. In
          the magnetic field line image, the Sun's surface shows the intensity of the radial component of the
          photospheric magnetic field. The brightest colors show the location of active regions (strong magnetic
          fields). <a href="http://www.predsci.com/corona/dec2020eclipse/solar_north.php">Images in a coordinate system aligned with solar
          north</a> are also available.

          The last set of images show a special visualization of the three-dimensional (3D) magnetic field. By tracing
          magnetic field lines at extremely high resolution, we can calculate a 3D map of the so-called
          squashing factor - a scientific measure designed to indicate the presence of complex structuring in the
          magnetic field. We then integrate the map along the line-of-sight, with special weightings to create a
          composite that resembles solar eclipse images. This is intended to highlight the inherent complexity of the
          Sun's magnetic field and its intimate connection to visible emission from the solar corona.

        <h3>Modeling the Corona for the Total Solar Eclipse</h3>

        <p>
        On December 14th, 2020, a total eclipse of the Sun will be visible across the South Pacific, Chile, and Argentina.
        Over land, the eclipse will be visible quite high in the sky, staying just over 70 degrees in azimuth. The longest duration 
        of totality will be about 2 minutes and 10 seconds, occurring in central Argentina.
        To see an interactive map of the path of the eclipse, please visit
        <a href="http://xjubier.free.fr/en/site_pages/solar_eclipses/TSE_2020_GoogleMapFull.html">
        Xavier Jubier's interactive Google map</a>. Also see 
        <a href="http://eclipsewise.com/oh/ec2020.html#SE2020JDec14T">
        Fred Espenak's Eclipse website</a> for a detailed narrative of the eclipse circumstances and additional maps.
        </p>

        <p>
         On November 29, 2020, we started an <a href="http://www.predsci.com/corona/model_desc.html">MHD computation</a>
          of the solar corona, in preparation for our prediction of what the solar corona will look like during this
          eclipse. After about a week of calculations, this final prediction was posted on December 7, 2020. For the prediction,
          we used data measured by the 
          <a href="http://hmi.stanford.edu/">HMI magnetograph</a> aboard NASA's
          <a href="http://sdo.gsfc.nasa.gov/">SDO spacecraft</a>. We used a combination of HMI synoptic and daily maps, 
          including data for Carrington rotation 2237 combined with data from a part of Carrington rotation 2238 measured 
          up to 12:00 UTC on November 29, 2020. We also used a special method to account for
          <a href="http://www.predsci.com/corona/dec2020eclipse/polar_fields.php">unobserved data at the poles</a>.
        </p>

        <p> It was interesting to
          see how much solar activity has picked up since the recent solar minimum, which is evident in the evolution of the
          <a href="http://www.predsci.com/corona/dec2020eclipse/photospheric_field.php">photospheric magnetic field</a> leading up to the start
          of the calculation.
          In just 17 days between starting the <a href="http://www.predsci.com/corona/dec2020eclipse_prelim">preliminary prediction</a> 
          (November 12) and starting this final prediction (November 29), 
          the surface magnetic flux in our MHD model increased by 50%! In this light, comparing the two predictions may 
          give a sense for how rapidly the corona (and it's appearance) is currently evolving.
        </p>

        <p>
          Our prediction is based on a magnetohydrodynamic model of the solar corona with a wave-turbulence-driven (WTD) 
          methodology and improved energy transport. New to this eclipse, our calculation computes both the proton and electron 
          temperatures separately, allowing these temperatures to collisionally decouple as they do in the solar wind.
          We have applied the WTD methodology to heat the corona previously, first in our
          prediction for the <a href="http://www.predsci.com/corona/aug2017eclipse/home.php">August 21, 2017 eclipse</a>.
          This particular simulation employs other updates to our technical approach for the WTD formalism and the heating 
          parametrization to better match the current solar conditions. This simulation is also
          quite large for this type of calculation, using 66 million grid points. For details about our model,
          please see our <a href="http://www.predsci.com/corona/model_desc.html">MAS Model Webpage</a> and
          <a href="#publications">publications</a>.
        </p>

         <p>
          As we did for the <a href="http://www.predsci.com/corona/aug2017eclipse/home.php">August 21, 2017 eclipse</a> and
          <a href="http://www.predsci.com/corona/jul2019eclipse/home.php">July 2, 2019 eclipse</a>,
          we introduced magnetic shear along polarity inversion lines (PILs - lines separating positive and negative
          polarity regions) where filament channels were observed in EUV emission by SDO/AIA. This is a well-known
          feature of large-scale coronal magnetic fields. The handedness of the shear was estimated using the
          hemispheric rule in quiet sun, and by visual inspection of AIA images for active regions (see
          <a href="http://www.predsci.com/corona/dec2020eclipse/energization.php">Energization</a>). The introduction of shear
          qualitatively changes the shape of the streamers and the connectivity of the underlying fields, and
          increases the free magnetic energy in the corona. This was particularly true for the filament channel in the top
          left of the prediction images, the appearance of which we tried to specifically capture with our method. 
          This structure supported a high-lying prominence that erupted at least twice in the past two solar rotations
          (October 23 and November 21), and it even produced a <a href="http://www.predsci.com/corona/dec2020eclipse/cme.php">CME</a> in our model!
        </p>

        <p>
          From our model, we can predict quantities that can be observed directly. We provide images of the
          <a href="http://www.predsci.com/corona/dec2020eclipse/brightness.php">total brightness (B)</a> and the
          <a href="http://www.predsci.com/corona/dec2020eclipse/pb.php">polarized brightness (pB)</a>. The B resembles what is seen by the
          naked eye. However, pB is the more scientifically useful quantity. Traditionally, pB has been used to
          separate light scattered by the K-corona and the F-corona. The K-corona is the photospheric light scattered
          by electrons in the corona, while the F-corona is the photospheric light scattered by dust, which is
          unpolarized. Note that we do not model the F-corona so its contribution to B is not included.
        </p>

        <p>
          We can also estimate <a href="http://www.predsci.com/corona/dec2020eclipse/emission.php">emission in extreme ultraviolet (EUV)
          wavelengths and X-rays</a>. The EUV emission can be compared with solar observations from the
          <a href="http://aia.lmsal.com/">AIA instrument</a> on <a href="http://sdo.gsfc.nasa.gov/">SDO</a>. X-ray
          emission can be compared with solar observations from the
          <a href="http://xrt.cfa.harvard.edu/">XRT instrument</a> on
          <a href="http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/solar-b/">Hinode</a>.

										Why the Future of Startups are Studios									</a>

									<p><span>Founders take on a ton of risk with no predetermined-set-reward at the end of their journey.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>“But what if there was a way to eliminate much of the risk without losing out on the possible reward? My prediction: product studios will breed major outcomes for founders,” Greg says.</span></p>
<p><span>What’s a product studio? Greg puts it as a lab for generating and testing ideas, then turning them into businesses. Pretty straightforward, right?</span></p>
<p><span>The studio model is supposed to help mitigate some of the risks that go into starting a company. Product studios allow teams to diversify a bit more and have more shots on goal.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Greg’s product studio is called </span><a href="https://withlatecheckout.com/"><span>Late Checkout</span></a><span> and he and his team focus on internet communities. “Focus is crucial because it allows you to get better with every new idea you explore. If your studio has a strong focus, you get to apply the learnings from one experiment to the next. It’s network effects 101.” — Greg Isenberg&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>How do product studios make money? Greg recommends:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Running a service business doing consulting/contracting work</span></li>
<li><span>Raise venture capital</span></li>
<li><span>Acquire a profitable business using your own capital or someone else’s. Bank loans/debt financing is a less risky option because the business is already profitable.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>“The core function of a product studio is to create awesome businesses. To do that, you need a process to put ideas through. Think of your process as a series of challenges that every idea must overcome to become a business. If an idea fails any of the challenges, scrap it.” — Greg Isenberg</span></p>
<p><span>Here’s how Late Checkout does it: (1) generate an idea. (2) flesh out the idea by doing research, product concepting, user testing, and design prototyping. (3) launch an experiment. (4) create a project that allows you to start building a minimal viable product to see if it connects with the market. (5) create a larger company out of the product that would operate like any other startup. Studio employees that are passionate about the project can choose to join the new company in key roles.</span></p>
<p><span>The reason why Greg says we’re in the golden age of the product studio is because, “experimentation has become absurdly quick and easy. Developer tools have gotten crazy powerful, and no-code tools have given non-developers the ability to build. You can literally drag and drop an e-commerce website into existence using an app on your phone.”</span></p>
<p><span>“There’s never been a better time to start a studio. And for employees thinking about joining a studio, try it. Jumping from project to project, startup to startup makes everyday fresh and interesting.” — Greg Isenberg</span></p>

								<p><b><i>My two cents</i></b><span>: Starting a product studio sounds so fun, especially if you’re working with smart and creative people. The most interesting aspect is how employees of product studios can peel off and join the products that they helped build as founders or other key roles. I’m sure there’s a ton of competition, but product studios don’t really get talked about enough it seems? </span></p>

<p><a href="https://newsroom.ibm.com/2020-10-08-IBM-To-Accelerate-Hybrid-Cloud-Growth-Strategy-And-Execute-Spin-Off-Of-Market-Leading-Managed-Infrastructure-Services-Unit">IBM recently announced</a> that it is spinning off its “IT infrastructure services” unit so that it can streamline its focus solely towards IBM’s “open hybrid cloud platform” by the end of 2021. Leveraging this aggressive assertion, I’ll be referring to this rebranded IBM as “IBM Hybrid Cloud” (vs. current IBM as just “IBM”) throughout this post for clarity.</p>
<p>I think most people – whether tech workers or investors – would agree that cloud stuff in general is far more riveting than IT services both intellectually and from a growth prospects perspective. With that said, public investors seem relatively unimpressed; while there was <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/10/08/ibm-shares-surge-on-plans-to-spin-off-unit-into-separate-publicly-traded-company-.html">an initial stock price bump upon the announcement</a>, the price is back to where it was pre-announcement<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>. In this post, I want to explore the answer to the question that seems to be floating around the market mindshare: what is IBM Hybrid Cloud’s future, really?</p>
<p>The best place to start this peregrination is probably to evaluate the existing IBM Cloud offering in the context of the public cloud providers. IBM, as you all are assuredly aware, is not one of the “Big Three,” the moniker given to Amazon Web Services (AWS), Google Cloud Platform (GCP), and Microsoft Azure due to their outsized share of the market. Perhaps most inauspiciously, Gartner places IBM Public Cloud on their Magic Quadrant (MQ) for Cloud IaaS in the pitiable “niche” quadrant. To add insult to injury, IBM rests behind Oracle Cloud both in “Ability to Execute” and in “Completeness of Vision” – and IBM’s position as a languishing laggard on the MQ <a href="https://twitter.com/QuinnyPig/status/1303409576587309056">hasn’t budged for three years</a>.</p>
<p>Thus, we arrive at our next line of inquiry: What went wrong? How did IBM totally whiff execution on cloud offerings? Could they not discern the blindingly obvious writing in the stars<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>?</p>
<hr>

<p>At least one ingredient in IBM’s stew of ineptitude was (and still is) their predilection for all things Watson, which clouded<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup> their judgment around the IaaS market.</p>
<p>IBM simultaneously rebuffed public cloud by insisting on pursuing the bare metal opportunity – the market for single tenant (unshared) physical servers – while also neglecting it, attempting to eke out greater profitability by decreasing engineering spend at a time when competitors were firing their proverbial money cannons at the IaaS market. IBM pursued the bare metal opportunity vis a vis their acquisition of SoftLayer in 2013 for $2 billion, which perhaps added a salty sprinkle of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunk_cost">sunk cost fallacy</a> to their clumsy calculus.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, IBM betting on SoftLayer was like buying a racehorse which you simultaneously neglect and “transform” via bureaucracy so irresponsibly that by the day of the race, its hoofs have downgraded into flippers and the horse is “racing” so slowly that the spectators are confused whether to laugh or cry.</p>
<p>Let’s set some quantitative context around this debacle. SoftLayer reportedly generated $335 million in revenue in 2012<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup> (pre-acquisition) and its revenue is now bundled into IBM Cloud’s “Infrastructure-as-a-Service” offering within the (relatively) newly defined “Cloud and Cognitive Software” segment<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup>. Given the segment’s overall revenue was $4.2 billion in 2019<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup> and Red Hat’s most recent fiscal year revenue pre-acquisition (more on that deal in a bit) was $3.4 billion<sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup>, the maximum revenue SoftLayer could have contributed in 2019 was around $1 billion.</p>
<p><img src="https://swagitda.com/blog/img/ibm-hybrid-cloud/chart1.png" alt="A pie chart showing IBM’s Cloud and Cognitive revenue in 2019. 81% for Red Hat and 19% for SoftLayer? Watson? Underpants Gnomes?"></p>
<p>That is an impressively mediocre growth story. To wit, in 2013 (the same year as the SoftLayer acquisition), annual AWS revenues reached $3.8 billion<sup id="fnref:8"><a href="#fn:8" role="doc-noteref">8</a></sup> and grew to $35 billion in 2019<sup id="fnref:9"><a href="#fn:9" role="doc-noteref">9</a></sup> — reflecting a healthy compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 44.8%. IBM’s bare metal bet via SoftLayer reflects, at best, a 13.2% CAGR<sup id="fnref:10"><a href="#fn:10" role="doc-noteref">10</a></sup> — only 0.2% higher than the CAGR for the Trucking industry<sup id="fnref:11"><a href="#fn:11" role="doc-noteref">11</a></sup>. That is, as the kids say, a big oof.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="red-hat-redemption">Red Hat Redemption?</h2>
<p>While IBM was off hobbling its racehorse, their repudiation of the cloud opportunity led to a power vacuum in the “trustworthy provider with reliable long-term support” domain, which Microsoft was voracious and primed to fill. This is partially why, despite chatter of Azure presenting inferior value across a variety of facets relative to AWS or GCP, sales are still quite stellar<sup id="fnref:12"><a href="#fn:12" role="doc-noteref">12</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Presumably sensing their nebulous<sup id="fnref:13"><a href="#fn:13" role="doc-noteref">13</a></sup> prospects in the cloud market, IBM completed the acquisition of Red Hat for a staggering <a href="https://www.redhat.com/en/about/press-releases/ibm-closes-landmark-acquisition-red-hat-34-billion-defines-open-hybrid-cloud-future">$34 billion</a> in summer 2019. This purchase price reflected a stock price premium of approximately 60%, which is double the typical premium<sup id="fnref:14"><a href="#fn:14" role="doc-noteref">14</a></sup> and perhaps a rare moment of lucidity at IBM in recognizing that no one wants to be acquired by them.</p>
<p>The surface rationale of the deal is that IBM can cross-sell Red Hat’s offerings to its customers, which is… quite a bit harder without the managed infrastructure services business, especially given this was the rationale highlighted in <a href="https://www.ibm.com/investor/att/pdf/ibm-2019-investor-briefing-presentation.pdf">the investor presentation on the deal</a>. But we will pull on that paradox’s thread soon enough.</p>
<p>What did IBM receive from Red Hat to cross-sell? Thankfully, Red Hat was publicly traded prior to the IBM acquisition, so we can delve into its financial profile by leveraging relatively recent data.</p>
<p>Red Hat is a predominately subscription business – it was 88% of fiscal year (FY) 2019 revenue<sup id="fnref:15"><a href="#fn:15" role="doc-noteref">15</a></sup>, growing by 14.6% year-over-year (y-o-y) – with the rest of revenue coming from “Training and Services.” The latter category is pretty self-explanatory and is growing at a decent rate (19.3% y-o-y), evidently due to customers needing some handholding around adopting OpenShift and Ansible.</p>
<p>Red Hat’s subscription revenue is primarily generated by “Infrastructure-related” subscriptions, which made up 72.3% of all subscription revenue as of FY 2019. The critical driver of the “Infrastructure-related” category is almost assuredly subscriptions for Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL), a Linux operating system (OS) favored by enterprises over the numerous open source Linux OSes due to the support provided with the subscription. With that said, “Infrastructure-related offerings” also includes Red Hat Satellite and Red Hat Virtualization and they don’t provide a further revenue breakdown.</p>
<p>The remaining 27.7% of subscription revenue is from “Application Development-related and other emerging technology subscription,” which is a ridiculous mouthful and belies the importance of the offerings for Red Hat’s growth strategy. “Application Development-related” explicitly refers to Red Hat Middleware, whose most notable offering is JBoss, an open source Java application server. Red Hat’s definition of “Emerging Technology” explicitly defines it as tools to “build and manage hybrid IT computing environments,”<sup id="fnref:16"><a href="#fn:16" role="doc-noteref">16</a></sup> and includes Red Hat OpenShift, Red Hat Cloud Infrastructure, Red Hat OpenStack Platform, Red Hat Ansible Automation, Red Hat CloudForms and Red Hat Storage technologies.</p>
<p><img src="https://swagitda.com/blog/img/ibm-hybrid-cloud/chart2.png" alt="A pie chart showing Red Hat’s Fiscal Year 2019 revenue breakdown. 64% for infrastructure-releated subscriptions, 24% for app development and “emerging technology” subscriptions, and 12% for training and services."></p>
<p>Of those emerging technologies, OpenShift, Ansible, and OpenStack are, by my estimation, the highest sources of revenue growth. For instance, infrastructure-related subscription revenue grew 9.3% y-o-y from FY 2018 to FY 2019 – which certainly doesn’t count as “high growth” – while app dev-related &amp; other emerging tech subscription grew 30.9% y-o-y (double Red Hat’s total revenue growth of 15.1% y-o-y). And it really is the emerging tech part of that second category fomenting that higher growth.</p>
<p>The “emerging technology” offerings are actually cannibalizing the “application development-related” offerings<sup id="fnref:17"><a href="#fn:17" role="doc-noteref">17</a></sup>. As more of the market leverages containerized environments for app development, they want a platform like OpenShift with orchestration capabilities, leading customers to replace JBoss spend with OpenShift spend<sup id="fnref:18"><a href="#fn:18" role="doc-noteref">18</a></sup>.</p>
<p>We now need to dig a little deeper into OpenShift to set the stage for spelunking through IBM’s hybrid cloud-dominated spinoff strategy. OpenShift is a container orchestration platform like Kubernetes, but provides professional support services around things like updates, patches, and integrations. Both OpenShift and Kubernetes manage clusters – groups of containers – to automatically handle the operations required to keep services running smoothly, like restarting failed containers, distributing network traffic across containers, mounting storage systems, optimizing resource usage, rolling out new container images, and so forth.</p>
<p>How does this fit in with “hybrid cloud”? Containers package all the stuff (like libraries, dependencies, configuration files, etc.) needed for an application to run. By putting all this stuff in one package, the application is no longer dependent on specific infrastructure and can be run in different computing environments. So, a containerized application can run just as well on-prem or in a private or public cloud and on top of any Linux distribution – which means that containers are sufficiently flexible to work with whatever mix of systems an organization operates that constitute their “hybrid cloud.”</p>
<p>This means OpenShift is perfect for “hybrid cloud,” right? Not quite. While Kubernetes works with any Linux distro and basically any cloud platform, OpenShift only works with CentOS<sup id="fnref:19"><a href="#fn:19" role="doc-noteref">19</a></sup>, Fedora, or <a href="https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux_atomic_host/7/html/installation_and_configuration_guide/introduction_to_atomic_host">Red Hat Enterprise Linux Atomic Host (RHELAH)</a>. Those distros are supported by AWS, Azure, and GCP, but it still obviously constrains one’s options and is discordant with the flexibility-first ethos of “hybrid cloud.” Similarly dissonant is the fact that OpenShift’s templates, a collection of files that define the resources needed to run an app, like a package manager, are largely unable to handle more complex deployments – and complex deployments are pretty common in a “hybrid cloud” environment.</p>
<p>There are notable benefits of OpenShift relative to Kubernetes – like better security defaults and container image management – but the dream orchestration solution for “hybrid cloud” it is not.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I've been writing JSON-REST APIs in Python for a number of years, and over that time I've found the tooling has greatly improved. To show you how you can benefit I'm going to show you how I've evolved. However, if you want to skip to the tooling I use today take a look at <a href="https://gitlab.com/pgjones/quart-schema">Quart-Schema</a>.</p> <p>Writing JSON-REST APIs in Python using Flask/Quart has always been pleasent. Yet communicating the API structure (routes, data, etc) to third parties and to my future self has not been. It is also difficult to guarantee that the API works as the documentation says it does. This has resulted in isses, bugs and misuse, in production I'd love to have avoided.</p> <p>I think I would have avoided these if the APIs I wrote,</p> <ul> <li>ensured that any data received or sent matched the communicated structure,</li> <li>communicated their structure using standardised documentation, specifically <a href="https://www.openapis.org/">OpenAPI</a>,</li> <li>were setup such that linting checks informed me if I made any mistakes,</li> <li>took less effort to write (whilst acheiving these aims).</li> </ul> <h2 id="initial-flask-setup">Initial Flask setup</h2> <p>This is a simple example of how I used to write a Flask APIs,</p> <pre><code><span>@app.route("/todo/", methods=["POST"])</span>
<span><span>def</span> <span>create_todo</span>():</span>
    data = request.get_json()
    todo_id = create_todo(data[<span>"task"</span>], data[<span>"due"</span>])
    todo = {<span>"id"</span>: todo_id, <span>"task"</span>: data[<span>"task"</span>], <span>"due"</span>: data[<span>"due"</span>]}
    <span>return</span> jsonify(todo), <span>201</span>
</code></pre> <p>which works very nicely, but meet none of my aims. Both myself and third party user would have to read the code to understand what is sent and returned by the API.</p> <p>It also does not help to know when the wrong data has been sent. For example <code>due</code> should be a date but if it isn't the <code>create_todo</code> function will raise a <code>ValueError</code> resulting in the API returning a 500 response. It should return a 400 response so that the third party and I can tell that it is an error with the data rather than a server or programming issue.</p> <h2 id="flask-with-docstrings">Flask with docstrings</h2> <p>In an attempt to solve the documentation problem experienced with the simple Flask setup I tried the <a href="https://sphinxcontrib-httpdomain.readthedocs.io/en/stable/">sphinx autohttp extensions</a>,</p> <pre><code><span>@app.route("/todo/", methods=["POST"])</span>
<span><span>def</span> <span>create_todo</span>():</span>
    <span>"""Create a TODO task.

    .. :quickref: Create a TODO.

    :reqheader Accept: application/json
    :&lt;json string task: task description
    :&lt;json string due: todo due date
    :&gt;json int id: todo unique identifier
    :&gt;json string task: task description
    :&gt;json string due: todo due date
    :resheader Content-Type: application/json
    :status 201: post created
    """</span>
    data = request.get_json()
    todo_id = create_todo(data[<span>"task"</span>], data[<span>"due"</span>])
    todo = {<span>"id"</span>: todo_id, <span>"task"</span>: data[<span>"task"</span>], <span>"due"</span>: data[<span>"due"</span>]}
    <span>return</span> jsonify(todo), <span>201</span>
</code></pre> <p>which enables documentation to be created by manually specifying the data structures in the docstring.</p> <p>Whilst this helps with the documentation it has the same issues as the simpler Flask example, in that it doesn't validate the data sent to the route, nor the data returned. It also doesn't help with any linters, for example a simple typo like <code>data["duo"]</code> would only raise an error during testing, or worse in production.</p> <p>The bigger issue though, is writing the docstring documentation as it is time consuming, boring work that I (and my colleagues) would forget to do. Over time this lead to the documentation being wrong leading to distrust and lack of use.</p> <p>I eventually stopped using this technique and reverted to the simpler example as this documentation ended up actively misleading. It also became clear that the winning documentation standard was OpenAPI, rather than sphinx documentation.</p> <h2 id="aside-switch-to-quart">Aside switch to Quart</h2> <p>It was around this time in that I switched from writing APIs in Flask to writing them in <a href="https://gitlab.com/pgjones/quart">Quart</a>. The snippets onwards in this article will now assume Quart, but the only difference is the use of async/await keywords, you can remove them to get a Flask equivalent.</p> <p>I wrote Quart as I wanted to start using the <code>async</code> <code>await</code> keywords and libraries. You can remove <code>async</code>, <code>await</code> from the examples to get a Flask equivalent.</p> <h2 id="jsonschema-decorators">JSONSchema decorators</h2> <p>The data sent and received in the APIs I write is formatted as JSON. This means a <a href="https://json-schema.org/">JSONSchema</a> could be used to describe the structure and used to validate that any data matches it. This allows me to write decorators that accept JSONSchemas to validate request and response data,</p> <pre><code><span>from</span> functools <span>import</span> wraps
<span>from</span> typing <span>import</span> Any, Callable, Dict

</code></pre> <p>The JSONSchemas can then be used as the documentation either when developing or to create an openapi specification of the API for third parties.</p> <p>This solves the validation and documentation problems, whilst ensuring that the documentation stays correct. It is however just as painful to write as the sphinx docstrings (although now it cannot be ignored). It also doesn't help linters understand what we are doing with the data.</p> <h2 id="dataclass-decorators">Dataclass decorators</h2> <p>To gain help from the linting tools the data needs to be defined in a structure they understand. Conveniently Python 3.7 shipped dataclasses which we can use to define the structure and will enable IDEs and linters to alert me of any issues. By altering the decorator to <a href="https://github.com/s-knibbs/dataclasses-jsonschema">convert</a> the dataclass to a JSONSchema allows a dataclass to be used instead,</p> <pre><code><span>@dataclass</span>
<span><span>class</span> <span>TodoData</span>:</span>
    due: date
    task: <span>str</span>

<span>@dataclass</span>
<span><span>class</span> <span>Todo</span>(<span>TodoData</span>):</span>
    <span>id</span>: <span>int</span>

<span>@app.route("/todo/", methods=["POST"])</span>
<span>@validate_request(TodoData)</span>
<span>@validate_response(Todo, 201)</span>
<span>async</span> <span><span>def</span> <span>index</span>() -&gt; Todo:</span>
    data = <span>await</span> request.get_json()
    todo_data = TodoData(**data)
    todo_id = create_todo(todo_data.task, todo_data.due)
    <span>return</span> Todo(<span>id</span>=todo_id, task=todo_data.task, due=todo_data.due), <span>201</span>
</code></pre> <p>which is actually quite pleasant code to write and actually makes it quicker (with the IDE autocompletion) than any of the previous examples.</p> <p>I have been experimenting with the code to make the dataclass decorators work for a while, and it isn't the easiest. Thankfully I recently came across <a href="https://pydantic-docs.helpmanual.io/usage/dataclasses/">pydantic's dataclasses</a> which validate the arguments, and can generate schemas for documentation.</p> <h2 id="quart-schema-conclusion-">Quart-Schema (Conclusion)</h2> <p><a href="https://gitlab.com/pgjones/quart-schema">Quart-Schema</a> is a Quart extension that provides the validation decorators and auto-generated documentation. The example in this article in full is,</p> <pre><code><span>from</span> datetime <span>import</span> date

<span>from</span> pydantic.dataclasses <span>import</span> dataclass
<span>from</span> quart <span>import</span> Quart
<span>from</span> quart_schema <span>import</span> QuartSchema, validate_request, validate_response

app = Quart(__name__)
QuartSchema(app)

<span>@dataclass</span>
<span><span>class</span> <span>TodoData</span>:</span>
    due: date
    task: <span>str</span>

<span>@dataclass</span>
<span><span>class</span> <span>Todo</span>(<span>TodoData</span>):</span>
    <span>id</span>: <span>int</span>

<span>@app.route("/todo/", methods=["POST"])</span>
<span>@validate_request(TodoData)</span>
<span>@validate_response(Todo, 201)</span>
<span>async</span> <span><span>def</span> <span>index</span>(<span>data: TodoData</span>) -&gt; Todo:</span>
    todo = <span>await</span> create_todo(data)
    <span>return</span> todo, <span>201</span>
</code></pre> <p>with the documentation available at <code>/docs</code> or <code>/openapi.json</code> for the raw form.</p> <p>I think, with Quart-Schema, that I've finally achieved all my initial aims in a form that is very clear and simple to write. This has only been possible with the async/await, type hinting, and dataclass improvements to Python made over the past few years.</p> <p>I'd quite like to know what you think of this - I'm on twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/pdgjones">@pdgjones</a>.</p> </div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
            <p>TORONTO -- 
	The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (<a href="https://www.unhcr.org/" target="_blank">UNHCR</a>) is marking the 70th anniversary of its operation in Canada with a free digital cookbook featuring recipes and personal stories of "resilience, heartbreak and hope" from refugees across Canada.</p>
<p>
	The cookbook, titled "Tastes from Home: Recipes from the Refugee Community," features more than 30 recipes and personal stories from 14 former refugees including Minister of Families, Children and Social Development Ahmed Hussen and former Governor General of Canada Adrienne Clarkson.</p>
<p>
	For every <a href="https://act.unhcr.ca/page/71880/petition/1?ea.tracking.id=SOC20_UNR_TFHEM" target="_blank">copy of the cookbook downloaded</a>, an anonymous donor will be making a donation to UNHCR in support of refugees and their families.</p>
<p>
	<a href="https://www.unhcr.ca/" target="_blank">UNHCR Canada</a> spokesperson Lauren La Rose told CTVNews.ca the cookbook is an opportunity to share the traditions and cultures of refugees, but also "reflect on the journey that brought them" to Canada.</p>
<p>
	"Food is just such a connective thread in all of our lives and not just from the standpoint of being nourishing and life sustaining, but it connects families and friends and communities," La Rose said in a telephone interview on Thursday.</p>
<p>
	She added that sharing food with others can be "optimistic and hopeful."</p>
<p>
	"Food is such a powerful communicator. You can share love with food, you can, in a small way, even educate people with food," La Rose explained. "The cookbook gives you a chance to really expand on your own kind of culinary journey in terms of using different spices and ingredients, or putting together different dishes that you might not have before."</p>
<h3>
	SHARING RECIPES AND STORIES</h3>
<p>
	Minister Ahmed Hussen hopes the recipes and stories shared in this cookbook help to humanize refugees and show their resilience in striving for a better life.</p>
<p>
	"Refugees are humans just like us," Hussen said in a telephone interview with CTVNews.ca on Thursday. "They're real people who just happen to be displaced.</p>
<p>
	"Refugees are not monolithic, they come from all corners of the world, they have different experiences, they have different genders and ages and skill sets and perspectives -- and that's OK because they reflect humanity," he added.</p>
<p>
	Hussen has three recipes in UNHCR Canada’s cookbook: spaghetti with tomato sauce and basil, grilled swordfish, and garlic-butter scallops.</p>
<p>
	Growing up in eastern Somalia on the Indian Ocean coast, Hussen said the majority of the food he ate was centered around seafood, or had an Italian influence as parts of Somalia were controlled by Italy at the time.</p>
<p>
	Hussen and his family later immigrated to Canada in 1993.</p>
<p>
	Hussen said he doesn’t cook often but when he does, it reminds him of his mother who ran the home and raised a family, all while finding the time to prepare nourishing meals on a daily basis.</p>
<p>
	"We weren't rich or anything, we were working class family, but she did a lot with a few ingredients and living next to the ocean certainly had a huge influence on us, as did the Italian influence," he explained.</p>
<p>
	While the cookbook's recipes highlight the culture of refugees, Hussen said the personal stories also provide an opportunity for asylum-seekers to reflect on their past.</p>
<p>
	"It's a chance for all of us who were once refugees to find out a little bit more about the stories of other refugees, and their experiences in their homelands and their story of survival and resilience in the face of difficulties," Hussen said.</p>
<p>
	For former Governor General of Canada Adrienne Clarkson, she says she likely wouldn’t have learned how to cook had she not immigrated to Canada from Japanese-occupied Hong Kong in 1941.</p>
<p>
	"I probably would not have ever cooked if I'd stayed in Hong Kong because it's a class society and so I would have run a house, but I would have had a cook and so I would have been telling a cook what to do," Clarkson explained in a telephone interview with CTVNews.ca on Thursday.</p>
<p>
	Clarkson, who was Governor General from 1999-2005, has contributed a poached Chinese chicken recipe to UNHCR Canada's cookbook, which she says is a dish that "shows Chinese cooking at its finest."</p>
<p>
	Clarkson said she learned to cook at the age of nine from her mother who made traditional, home-cooked Chinese meals three or four times a week for the family.</p>
<p>
	Clarkson said she thought knowing how to cook would be a valuable skill should her family ever have to flee again.</p>
<p>
	"I love cooking and I always have and I guess that was because I was a refugee. We always thought that if there were another war, we'd have to go somewhere and make our life again as we had when we first came to Canada," Clarkson said.</p>
<p>
	"Because you've been a refugee once, you never doubt that you could lose everything again," she added.</p>
<p>
	Clarkson said the cookbook's recipes and personal stories show that when refugees come to Canada, they make the country their home, but also bring some parts of their culture to share with others.</p>
<p>
	She added that there are few things that bring people of different backgrounds together like a home-cooked meal.</p>
<p>
	"I think doing things for yourself and having that satisfaction that you've cooked something wonderful for your family, nothing can replace that," Clarkson said.</p>
<h3>
	REFUGEE CRISIS</h3>
<p>
	<a href="https://www.unhcr.ca/" target="_blank">According to UNHCR</a>, Canada has been a global leader in refugee resettlement and has welcomed more than one million refugees since 1980. In 2018, Canada resettled <a href="https://www.ctvnews.ca/canada/canada-resettled-more-refugees-than-any-other-country-in-2018-un-says-1.4473523" target="_blank">more refugees than any other country</a>.</p>
<p>
	While La Rose acknowledges that Canada has "accomplished quite a bit" when it comes to helping those who have been displaced, she says "there's still a long way to go."</p>
<p>
	According to the UNHCR, 80 million people are displaced worldwide including more than 26 million refugees.</p>
<p>
	"We're so fortunate to have the 14 individuals who are now part of the Canadian family to share their stories in this cookbook, but there's so many more out there that are in need of support and assistance," La Rose said.</p>
<p>
	La Rose explained that the Canadian operation of the UN refugee agency was created in 1950 following the Second World War to help address the "large numbers" of people who were uprooted in Europe following the war's end.</p>
<p>
	"The mandate of UNHCR Canada was only supposed to last for three years, and here we are, 70 years after that because the need remains immensely great," La Rose said.</p>
<p>
	By hearing directly from refugees who have found a home in Canada, La Rose said she hopes the cookbook will raise more awareness about UNHCR Canada and the work it does in helping asylum-seekers.</p>
<p>
	"We hope that people will walk away with a little bit more of an insight in education on what causes people to be displaced, and the fact that there's so many more people in need," La Rose said.</p>

          <p>Modern SaaS applications usually run a landing page, blog, and the main app separately. For a landing page, you may want to use Tilda, Webflow, or other web-builders. For a blog, it’s common to use self-hosted CMS such as WordPress, Ghost, or others.</p><p>It’s crucially important to index the main domain <em>&lt;your_domain&gt;.com</em> instead of a subdomain <em>blog.&lt;your_domain&gt;.com</em> for SEO purposes. You want as many links to your main domain as possible. The more content on <em>&lt;your_domain&gt;.com/blog</em>, the more Google will index it.</p><p>Running Ghost blog on a subdomain such as <em>blog.&lt;your_domain&gt;.com</em> is easy, just create a new A-record in your DNS provider and point it to a machine with running Ghost instance. If you want to run <em>&lt;your_domain&gt;.com</em> on a Webflow and <em>&lt;your_domain&gt;.com/blog</em> being self-hosted Ghost you need a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_proxy">reverse-proxy</a> server.</p><figure><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/UuksUWzN_7UWYIP5FZuiw-P56qciVguMdmRpQCv6-CjcqFCuMR6Cw2EinFygRzNViX3U9WPzbtMpvDimAJHd4f2Fui_dwAVUHOlITWaFUkOptuo_OtVRr_5xDu-k1YAvy4Mzt3NH" alt=""><figcaption>Reverse proxy server</figcaption></figure><p>From a devops point of view our goals are:</p><ol><li><em>&lt;your_domain&gt;.com</em> -&gt; Webflow</li><li><em>&lt;your_domain&gt;.com/*</em> -&gt; Webflow</li><li><em>&lt;your_domain&gt;.com/blog</em> -&gt; self hosted Ghost blog</li><li><em>blog.&lt;your_domain&gt;.com</em> -&gt; <em>&lt;your_domain&gt;.com/blog</em></li></ol><p>We’re going to use <a href="https://caddyserver.com/">Caddy</a> for reverse-proxy.

                    <p>In the time I’ve worked at Streamlit, I’ve seen hundreds of impressive data apps ranging from computer vision applications to public health <a href="https://discuss.streamlit.io/t/data-apps-regarding-covid-19/2203">tracking of COVID-19</a> and even simple <a href="https://joelgrus.com/2020/10/02/creating-games-in-streamlit/">children’s games</a>. I believe the growing popularity of Streamlit comes from the fast, iterative workflows through the <a href="https://docs.streamlit.io/en/stable/api.html?highlight=magic#magic-commands">Streamlit “magic”</a> functionality and auto-reloading the front-end upon saving your Python script. Write some code, hit ‘Save’ in your editor, then visually inspect the correctness of each code change. And with the unveiling of <a href="https://www.streamlit.io/sharing">Streamlit sharing</a> for easy deployment of Streamlit apps, you can go from idea to coding to deploying your app in just minutes!</p><p>Once you've created a Streamlit app, you can use automated testing to future-proof it against regressions. In this post, I'll be showing how to programmatically validate that a Streamlit app is unchanged visually using the Python package <a href="https://seleniumbase.io/">SeleniumBase</a>.</p><h2 id="case-study-streamlit-folium">Case Study: streamlit-folium</h2><p>To demonstrate how to create automated visual tests, I’m going to use the <a href="https://github.com/randyzwitch/streamlit-folium">streamlit-folium GitHub repo</a>, a Streamlit Component I created for the <a href="https://python-visualization.github.io/folium/">Folium Python library for leaflet.js</a>. <a href="https://baseweb.design/blog/visual-regression-testing/">Visual regression tests</a> help detect when the layout or content of an app changes, without requiring the developer to manually visually inspect the output each time a line of code changes in their Python library. Visual regression tests also help with cross-browser compatibility of your Streamlit apps and provide advanced warning about new browser versions affecting how your app is displayed.<br></p><figure><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/QxYpumCHmheacg4M2WTMLd8ZWTr4I2Kvo4zPJnC63cwQfQlXDojmaK3qbsmnNgNpudOaBTfg9CEH8y3MarInWbG4vs4O1ebI0oDvtrat6iPgkCngGPzSPHDyHMS1uUa1Uzclg22L" alt=""><figcaption>Baseline image of streamlit-folium test application</figcaption></figure><h3 id="setting-up-a-test-harness">Setting Up A Test Harness</h3><p>The streamlit-folium test harness has three files:</p><ul><li><a href="https://github.com/randyzwitch/streamlit-folium/blob/master/tests/requirements.txt"><code>tests/requirements.txt</code></a>: the Python packages only needed for testing</li><li><a href="https://github.com/randyzwitch/streamlit-folium/blob/master/tests/app_to_test.py"><code>tests/app_to_test.py</code></a>: the reference Streamlit app to test</li><li><a href="https://github.com/randyzwitch/streamlit-folium/blob/master/tests/test_package.py"><code>tests/test_package.py</code></a>: the tests to demonstrate the package works as intended</li></ul><p>The first step is to create a Streamlit app using the package to be tested and use that to set the baseline. We can then use SeleniumBase to validate that the structure and visual appearance of the app remains unchanged relative to the baseline. </p><p>This post focuses on describing <code>test_package.py</code> since it’s the file that covers how to use SeleniumBase and OpenCV for Streamlit testing.</p><h3 id="defining-test-success">Defining Test Success</h3><p>There are several ways to think about what constitutes looking <em>the same</em> in terms of testing. I chose the following three principles for testing my streamlit-folium package:</p><ol><li>The <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document_Object_Model/Introduction">Document Object Model (DOM) structure</a> (but not necessarily the values) of the page should remain the same</li><li>For values such as headings, test that those values are exactly equal</li><li>Visually, the app should look the same</li></ol><p>I decided to take these less strict definitions of “unchanged” for testing streamlit-folium, as the internals of the Folium package itself appear to be non-deterministic. Meaning, the same Python code will create the same <em>looking</em> image, but the generated HTML will be different.</p><h2 id="testing-using-seleniumbase">Testing Using SeleniumBase</h2><p>SeleniumBase is an all-in-one framework written in Python that wraps the <a href="https://www.selenium.dev/">Selenium WebDriver</a> project for browser automation. SeleniumBase has two functions that we can use for the first and second testing principles listed above: <a href="https://seleniumbase.io/examples/visual_testing/ReadMe/#automated-visual-regression-testing">check_window</a>, which tests the DOM structure and <a href="https://seleniumbase.io/help_docs/method_summary/">assert_text</a>, to ensure a specific piece of text is shown on the page. </p><p>To check the DOM structure, we first need a baseline, which we can generate using the <code>check_window</code> function. The <code>check_window</code> has two behaviors, based on the required <code>name</code> argument:</p><ul><li>If a folder &lt;<strong>name&gt;</strong> within the <code>visual_baseline/&lt;Python file&gt;.&lt;test function name&gt;</code> path does not exist, this folder will be created with all of the baseline files</li><li>If the folder <em>does exist</em>, then SeleniumBase will compare the current page against the baseline at the specified accuracy level</li></ul><p>You can see an example of calling <a href="https://github.com/randyzwitch/streamlit-folium/blob/master/tests/test_package.py#L19">check_window</a> and the resulting <a href="https://github.com/randyzwitch/streamlit-folium/tree/master/tests/visual_baseline/test_package.test_basic/first_test">baseline files</a> in the streamlit-folium repo. In order to keep the baseline constant between runs, I committed these files to the repo; if I were to make any substantive changes to the app I am testing (<code>app_to_test.py</code>), I would need to remember to set the new baseline or the tests would fail.</p><p>With the baseline folder now present, running check_window runs the comparison test. I chose to run the test at <strong>Level 2</strong>, with the level definitions as follows:</p><ul><li><strong>Level 1 (least strict)</strong>: HTML tags are compared to <a href="https://github.com/randyzwitch/streamlit-folium/blob/master/tests/visual_baseline/test_package.test_basic/first_test/tags_level_1.txt">tags_level1.txt</a></li><li><strong>Level 2</strong>: HTML tags and attribute names are compared to <a href="https://github.com/randyzwitch/streamlit-folium/blob/master/tests/visual_baseline/test_package.test_basic/first_test/tags_level_2.txt">tags_level2.txt</a></li><li><strong>Level 3 (most strict)</strong>: HTML tags, attribute names and attribute values are compared to <a href="https://github.com/randyzwitch/streamlit-folium/blob/master/tests/visual_baseline/test_package.test_basic/first_test/tags_level_3.txt">tags_level3.txt</a> &nbsp; &nbsp; </li></ul><p>As mentioned in the “Defining Test Success” section, I run the <code>check_window</code> function at Level 2, because the Folium library adds an GUID-like id value to the attribute values in the HTML, so the tests will never pass at Level 3 because the attribute values are always different between runs.</p><p>For the second test principle (“check certain values are equal”), the <code>assert_text</code> method is very easy to run:</p><p><code>self.assert_text("streamlit-folium")</code></p><p>This function checks that the exact text “streamlit-folium” is present in the app, and the test passes because it’s the value of the H1 heading in this example.</p><h2 id="testing-using-opencv">Testing Using OpenCV</h2><p>While checking the DOM structure and presence of a piece of text provides some useful information, my true acceptance criterion is that the visual appearance of the app doesn’t change from the baseline. In order to test that the app is visually the same <em>down to the pixel</em>, we can use the <code>save_screenshot</code> method from SeleniumBase to capture the current visual state of the app and compare to the baseline using the OpenCV package:</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>Using OpenCV, the first step is to read in the baseline image and the current snapshot, then compare that the size of the pictures are identical (the <code>shape</code> comparison checks that the NumPy ndarrays of pixels have the same dimensions). Assuming the pictures are both the same size, we can then use the <code>subtract</code> function from OpenCV to calculate the per-element difference between pixels by channel (blue, green and red). If all three channels have no differences, then we know that the visual representation of the Streamlit app is identical between runs.</p><h2 id="automating-tests-using-github-actions">Automating Tests Using GitHub Actions</h2><p>With our SeleniumBase and OpenCV code set up, we can now feel free to make changes to our Streamlit Component (or other Streamlit apps) and not worry about things breaking unintentionally.

<p><strong>The concept of I-frames, P-frames, and B-frames is fundamental to the field of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_compression#Video" target="_blank" rel="noopener">video compression</a>. These three frame types are used in specific situations to improve the stream’s <a href="https://ottverse.com/need-for-video-compression/">compression efficiency,</a> video quality, and resilience.</strong></p>



<p>In this tutorial, we look at how I-frames, P-frames, and B-frames work and what they are used for. If you are into video compression, do read our</p>



<ul><li><a href="https://ottverse.com/discrete-cosine-transform-dct-video-compression/">tutorial on the discrete cosine transform</a>,</li><li><a href="https://ottverse.com/need-for-video-compression/">why video compression is important</a>,</li><li>and a <a href="https://ottverse.com/what-is-a-video-codec/">layman’s explanation of what a video codec is and how it’s created</a>.</li></ul>



<p>Okay, with that, let’s get started with a couple of fundamental aspects of modern day video compression – Intra and Inter prediction.</p>



<h2>Inter and Intra Prediction</h2>



<p>I won’t do a deep dive of Intra and Inter-prediction in this article, but, I’ll give you an idea of why these exist and what they are meant for. </p>



<p>Take, for example, the image below. It shows two video frames (adjacent to each other) with a rectangular block of black pixels. In frame 1, the block is on the left-hand side of the image, and in the second frame, it has moved to the right.</p>



<p>If I want to compress Frame #2 using a modern video codec like H.264 or HEVC, I would do something as follows – </p>



<ol><li>Break the video into blocks of pixels (<strong>macroblocks</strong>) and compress them one at a time.</li><li>In order to compress each macroblock, the first step is to find a macroblock similar to the one we want to compress by searching in the current frame or previous or future frames.</li><li>The best-match macroblock’s location is recorded (which frame and its position in that frame). Then, the two macroblocks’ difference is compressed and sent to the decoder along with the location information. </li></ol>



<p>With me so far? Good! </p>



<p>Take a look at the image below. If I want to compress the macroblock in Frame #2 (that I’ve marked with a red square), what do you think is the best option? Or how should it be done?</p>



<div><figure><img width="872" height="476" src="https://i0.wp.com/ottverse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-25.png?resize=872%2C476&amp;ssl=1" alt="I-frames, P-frames, and B-frames and Intra Prediction" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/ottverse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-25.png?w=872&amp;ssl=1 872w, https://i0.wp.com/ottverse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-25.png?resize=300%2C164&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/ottverse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-25.png?resize=768%2C419&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/ottverse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-25.png?resize=870%2C476&amp;ssl=1 870w" sizes="(max-width: 872px) 100vw, 872px" data-recalc-dims="1" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20872%20476'%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-lazy-srcset="https://i0.wp.com/ottverse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-25.png?w=872&amp;ssl=1 872w, https://i0.wp.com/ottverse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-25.png?resize=300%2C164&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/ottverse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-25.png?resize=768%2C419&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/ottverse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-25.png?resize=870%2C476&amp;ssl=1 870w" data-lazy-src="https://i0.wp.com/ottverse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-25.png?resize=872%2C476&amp;ssl=1"></figure></div>



<ol><li>First, I can look in frame #1 and find the matching block. It appears to have moved by a distance approximately the frame’s width (a little less, I know) and approximately at the same height. Good, we have the motion vector now. </li><li>I can search within the same frame and quickly realize that the block above the one marked in red is IDENTICAL to it. So, I can tell the decoder to copy that one instead of hunting in another frame. The motion vector (if any) is also minimal.</li></ol>







<p><strong>Now take a look at the next example. We want to compress the macroblock containing the blue sphere in frame #2. How should we go about doing this? Search within the same frame or search in previously encoded frames?</strong></p>

<ol id="block-12e1077d-9448-49d1-a769-8b5a645b4186"><li>First, I can look in frame #1 and find the matching sphere. It appears to have moved by a distance approximately the frame’s width (a little less, I know) and moved up a little. This gives us the motion vector. The difference between the two blocks containing spheres appears to be very small (guesstimate!)</li><li>Second, I can search within the same frame and realize no other block contains a sphere. So, bad luck searching for a match within the same frame! </li></ol>



<p>So, what did we learn from these toy examples?</p>



<ol><li><span>Encoders search for matching macroblocks to reduce the size of the data that needs to be transmitted. This is done via a process of </span><strong>motion estimation and compensation.</strong><span> This allows the encoder to find the horizontal and vertical displacement of a macroblock in another frame.</span></li><li>An encoder can search for a matching block <strong>within the same frame (Intra Prediction)</strong> and <strong>adjacent (Inter Prediction) frames</strong>.</li><li>It compares the Inter and Intra prediction results for each macroblock and chooses the “best” one. This process is dubbed “Mode Decision,” and in my opinion, it’s the heart of a video codec.</li></ol>



<p>Again, sorry for the super fast explanation of Intra and Inter Prediction. It’s a vast topic, and I haven’t even scratched the surface. In a future article, I’ll talk about the different ways to perform motion estimation, fast searches, sub-pel motion estimation, early exits, and so many amazing aspects of motion estimation and compensation! </p>



<p>For now, with this whirlwind introduction to Intra and Inter prediction, let’s learn about I, P, and B frames.</p>



<h2>What is an I-frame?</h2>



<p><strong>An I-frame or a Key-Frame or an Intra-frame consists ONLY of macroblocks that use Intra-prediction</strong>. That’s it.</p>



<p>Any macroblock in an I-frame is allowed to refer to other macroblocks only within the same frame. That is, it can only use “<strong>spatial redundancies</strong>” in the frame for compression. </p>



<p>An I-frame comes in different avatars – IDR, CRA, BLA, etc. but the essence remains. No temporal prediction allowed. </p>



<p>An I-frame has many uses which we’ll study after the introduction to P and B-frames. </p>



<h2>What is a P-frame?</h2>



<p>P-frame stands for Predicted Frame and allows macroblocks to be compressed using temporal prediction in addition to spatial prediction. For motion estimation, P-frames use frames that have been previously encoded. In essence, every macroblock in a P-frame can be, </p>



<ul><li>temporally predicted, or</li><li>spatially predicted, or</li><li>skipped (i.e, you tell the decoder to copy the co-located block from the previous frame – a “zero” motion vector).</li></ul>

<p>I made an illustration to drive home an important point. You can see both I-frames and P-frames in the image above. The P-frames refer to previously encoded I/P-frames as discussed earlier. You can also see that the order in which the frames are encoded/decoded is the same as how they are presented to the user. This is because P-frames only refer to previously encoded pictures. </p>



<h2>What is a B-frame?</h2>



<p>A B-frame is a frame that can refer to frames that occur both before and after it. The <strong>B</strong> stands for Bi-Directional for this reason. If your video codec uses macroblock based compression (like H.264/AVC does), then each macroblock of a B-frame can</p>



<ul><li>be predicted using backward prediction (using frames that occur in the future)</li><li>be predicted using forward prediction (using frames that occur in the past)</li><li>be predicted without inter-prediction – only Intra</li><li>can be skipped completely (with Intra or Inter prediction).</li></ul>



<p>And because they have the ability to refer to and interpolate from two (or more) frames that occur before and after it (in the time dimension), B-frames can be incredibly efficient in reducing the size of the frame while retaining the video quality. </p>



<p>However, B-frames are resource-heavy – both at the encoder and decoder. Let’s see why! </p>



<p>To understand the impact of B-frames, let’s understand the concepts of <strong>Presentation/Display Order</strong> and <strong>Decoding Order</strong>. </p>



<p>Taking the simple case of I and P frames. If you use only these two picture types, every frame will either refer to itself (I-frame) or to a previous frame (P-frame). So, the frames can come in and out of the encoder in the same order. Here, the Presentation Order (or Display Order) is the same as the Decode/Encode order. </p>

<p>But, if a frame refers to another frame that is displayed in the future, what do you do? This is the situation that we see when we use B-frames for compression. Take a look at the image below that shows a GOP (group of pictures) structure that uses two B-pictures and one P in each mini-GOP. i.e., IBBPBBP. </p>

<p>Frame #2 in Display Order is a B-frame that depends on Frames 1 &amp; 4 as references. But, to encode Frame#2, we need to wait till Frame #4 enters the encoder, is encoded, and only then available as a Reference for Frame #2. </p>



<p>The same thing occurs at the decoder. </p>



<p>The decoder decodes Frame #1 (I-frame) and then Frame #2 (P-frame) in decoding order. But, it cannot display Frame #2 because it is actually Frame #4 in Display Order! So, it needs to place it in a buffer until it is time to display it.</p>



<p>So, the encoder and decoder need to maintain two “orders” in memory – one to display the frames and the other to encode/decode them.</p>



<p>So, B-frames do impact the size of the decoder’s buffer and increases latency. So, many systems force you to be careful and not use too many predictors (e.g., 3 or 4 future frames) to predict a single B-frame. As another example, H.264/AVC’s Baseline profile is aimed at low-end devices and does not allow the use of B-frames or slices.</p>



<h2>Reference B-frame and Non-Reference B-frames</h2>



<p>As we’ve learned, a B-frame can refer to two or more frames – typically, one in the future and one in the past regarding its position. We also learned that an I-frame does not refer to any other frame and a P-frame refers to a picture in the past. The question naturally arises – can any picture use a B-picture as its reference frame?</p>



<p>The answer is <strong>Yes</strong>. </p>



<ul><li>A B-frame can act as a reference, and if so, it is termed as a reference B-frame.</li><li>If a B-frame is not to be used as a reference, it is called a non-reference B-frame. </li></ul>



<p>It is important to signal whether a frame is a reference or a non-reference B-frame in the bitstream because the decoder needs to store reference frames in its DPB (Decoded Picture Buffer). </p>



<p><strong>If a frame is signaled as a non-reference B-frame, and it is used as a reference, the decoder could crash </strong>because, in all likelihood, the decoder would have discarded that frame after decoding and displaying it.</p>



<p>Most decoders will quantize reference B-frames at a better quality than non-reference B-frames to minimize propogation losses. </p>



<h2>Use of I, P, and B-frames in Video Compression &amp; Streaming</h2>



<p>With a technical understanding of how I-frames, P-frames, and B-frames work, now let’s tackle an important question. <strong>Why should you use them?</strong></p>



<p>In the next few sections, let’s understand the most important use cases of I, P, and B-frames in video compression.<strong> </strong></p>



<h3>Where do you use I-frames?</h3>



<p>We learned in the earlier sections that I-frames can be independently encoded and decoded and this drives their usage in video compression. </p>



<h3>Refreshing Video Quality</h3>



<p>I-frames are generally inserted to designate the end of a GOP (Group of Pictures) or a video …</p></div></div></article></main></div></div></div></div>

    <span>December 6, 2020</span>

  </p>

  <p>
    If you've ever managed any software project, you've probably asked
    yourself: how could our teams move faster? How fast are we moving today?
  </p>

  <p>
    For these kinds of questions, it's tempting to turn to metrics. After all,
    we use metrics routinely and successfully when we develop software. There's
    performance, production load, and uptime metrics. There are also metrics
    based on customer behavior, like conversion and retention. These metrics
    don't just provide visibility. More importantly, they create a feedback
    loop. We can make a change that is intended to improve something, and use
    metrics to see how much improvement there really was. Developer wisdom says
    that every software performance optimization must start with a measure,
    which makes perfect sense.
  </p>

  <p>
    Since metrics are so helpful, can't we apply them to software development
    speed? As better development processes should improve development output,
    maybe output metrics could measure whether processes really improved. So
    then, what metrics could we use?
  </p>

  
  <h2 id="we-dont-have-any-good-metrics-for-that">
    <a href="#we-dont-have-any-good-metrics-for-that">We don't have any good metrics for that</a>
  </h2>


  <p>
    Development speed is the amount of work produced per unit of time, so we
    need to measure both output and time. Measuring time is simple, no problem
    there. What about work output? Attempts to measure it are as old as
    software itself. Through the years one thing's held true: whenever we
    decide a metric measures work output, something unintended soon follows.
    Consider the following examples:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <b>Lines of code</b> - Probably the oldest one. Almost no one takes it
      seriously today. Counting code lines just makes the code bloated and the
      developers focus on the simplest task possible;
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>No. of commits</b> - encourages developers to break up their commits
      into many parts. Once again, the focus is on the simplest tasks and
      refactorings. Complex problems are avoided;
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>No. of tasks completed</b> - leads to tasks being split into subtasks.
      Every problem, even minor, is submitted as a task. Also adds an incentive
      to cut corners to complete tasks as fast as possible;
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>No. of bugs, or percentage of bugs</b> - not a metric of work output,
      but work quality. Discourages developers from making changes, and makes
      them reluctant to report bugs that they found themselves;
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>Man-hours or storypoints</b> - when estimates form the basis for how
      team performance is measured, it's easy to guess what comes next —
      inflated estimates;
    </li>
    <li>... and so on.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Developers are smart. They specialize in cracking complex problems. For any
    metric you give them, they'll find the easiest way to improve on it. This
    way most likely won't correlate with work quality or desired project
    outcome. This doesn't necessarily mean that developers will game them. I'd
    say it depends on the context and how strong the incentives are. But one
    thing is certain - developers will realize that the measure of their
    productivity is disconnected from what matters. This is not only
    frustrating. It also distracts them from doing the real work.
  </p>

  
  <h2 id="but-why">
    <a href="#but-why">But why?</a>
  </h2>


  <p>
    Why do metrics work so well for software products, and not for measuring
    developer output? Is it some kind of developer conspiracy? Actually, if you
    look outside of software development, you'll find more examples where
    metrics work well, and where they don't.
  </p>

  <p>
    <b>Where metrics work well:</b> manufacturing and sales. Let's take the
    manufacture and sale of cups. You can measure production output, i.e. no.
    of cups produced per unit of time, and production quality — percentage of
    cups that failed to pass quality control. On the sales side, you can
    measure sales volume and profit margin. These metrics are really helpful
    for management. For example, the goal for the manufacturing department can
    be to improve the percentage of cups that successfully pass quality control,
    while keeping unit costs low. The head of sales can aim to increase sales
    volume or improve profit margins. Improvements in these metrics are good
    for business, so we can also treat them as a measure of efficiency of
    corresponding departments.
  </p>

  <p>
    <b>Where metrics don't work:</b> measuring scientific output. Scientists
    publish their research in articles. Now science also has some metrics that
    measure work output and quality: no. of articles published, no. of
    citations, statistical significance of the results. Can we say that a
    scientist who published 10 articles has produced twice as much value as a
    scientist who published 5? Unlikely. Works differ too much in their value.
    Even without numbers, it's often hard to say which work is more valuable.
    Because "hacking" one's number of publications  and citations is a
    well-known problem in the scientific community, they're not considered
    reliable indicators of work productivity. Statistical significance has its
    own issues too -
    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42QuXLucH3Q" target="_blank">
      p-hacking is a wide-spread problem</a>.
  </p>

  
  <h2 id="two-key-criteria">
    <a href="#two-key-criteria">Two key criteria</a>
  </h2>


  <p>
    In any context, metrics that work well share two important criteria:
  </p>

  <ol>
    <li>
      They relate directly to value;
    </li>
    <li>
      These values are consistent, i.e. in countable quantities of
      interchangeable units.
    </li>
  </ol>

  <p>
    Let's take a look at the examples above:
  </p>

  <p>
    Metrics in manufacturing and sales satisfy both criteria. In cups
    manufacturing, value is represented in cups. Since it's mass produced,
    cups are identical. In sales, value is measured in dollars. The business
    goal is to make money, so money's relationship with business value is as
    direct as possible. As one dollar is equal to any other, metrics based on
    money measure consistent values.
  </p>

  <p>
    In science, these criteria aren't satisfied. We can't find a metric that
    would measure the value of scientific results directly. We have only
    indirect metrics, like no. of articles and citations, which can be hacked.
    In any case, these metrics aren't consistent either, because all
    publications are not made of interchangeable units.
  </p>

  
  <h2 id="developer-metrics-fail-both-criteria">
    <a href="#developer-metrics-fail-both-criteria">Developer metrics fail both criteria</a>
  </h2>


  <p>
    What do we have to measure developer output? Lines of code, no. of commits,
    no. of tasks completed, man-hours, storypoints… Considering these metrics
    against the two key criteria above, you'll find that:
  </p>

  <ol>
    <li>
      None of them relate directly to value. We don't ship our customers lines
      of code, man-hours, or storypoints. They don't care how many commits we
      made or how many tasks we completed;
    </li>
    <li>
      All these measurements are inconsistent. One commit is not equal to
      another, one line of code is not as valuable as the other line, all tasks
      are also different, and man-hours and storypoints are based on estimates,
      which are by definition inaccurate.
    </li>
  </ol>

  <p>
    It's no surprise that none of these metrics work well.
  </p>

  <p>
    Why don't we have metrics for developers that would relate directly to
    value? For the same reason we don't have any for scientists. Developers,
    just like scientists, always create something new. They don't write the
    same code again and again — that wouldn't make sense. Code can be re-used
    in a variety of ways — you can either extract it to a module or a library,
    or, as a last resort, just copy and paste it. Every developers' workday is
    unique. Even if they solve similar problems, they solve them in a different
    context, or a new way, each time.

  </h2>


  <p>
    Of course, no one today seriously talks about measuring developers' output
    in lines of code. There should be something more modern, right?
  </p>

  <p>
    The book <i>Accelerate</i> from 2018 presents research on 2000
    organizations of different sizes. The research goal was to identify which
    metrics would differentiate high performers from low. Here's what they
    found:

        Performance," in Accelerate: The Science behind DevOps: Building and
        Scaling High Performing Technology Organizations
      </i>
    </sup>
  </p>

  <p>
    We can see four metrics here. Let's see how these metrics relate to value,
    and whether they're consistent:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <b>Deployment frequency</b> - I can see why it's listed here. The more
      frequently you ship to production, the more reliable the shipping process
      becomes. Productive teams tend to ship code more frequently. However,
      correlation doesn't imply causation. It's not directly related to
      customer value. People want a product that satisfies their needs, not a
      product that changes as frequently as possible. The metric is also
      inconsistent, because one change shipped to production is not equal to
      another.
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>Lead time</b> - the time for satisfying customer requests. This one
      relates more closely to value, because we're talking about the changes
      customers have asked for. However, it's not a metric with consistent
      units, because requests are not equal to each other. Some might be
      simple, and …</li></ul></div></div></div>

								</p>
								<div>
									<p><span>When it comes to sleep, the importance of our diets can easily be forgotten.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Researchers have found that diets that involve high sugar, saturated fat, and processed carbohydrates can be poor for our sleep. Whereas plants, fiber, and rich unsaturated fats can help with our sleep.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Another sleep aid that you probably hadn’t heard of is Tryptophan. “An amino acid found in many foods, including dairy and turkey, which is one of the reasons commonly given for why so many of us feel so sleepy after our Thanksgiving feasts.” — Anahad O’Connor</span></p>
<p><span>Tryptophan is competing with other amino acids, though. So one way to enhance its uptake is through pairing foods that have it with carbohydrates.</span></p>
<p><span>On the topic of carbs, “eating carbs may help you fall asleep faster, but it is best to consume ‘complex’ carbs that contain fiber, which may help you obtain more deep, restorative sleep.” — Anahad O’Connor</span></p>
<p><span>”Diet and sleep are entwined. Improving one can help you improve the other and vice versa, creating a positive cycle where they perpetuate one another.” — Dr. Susan Redline</span></p>
<p><span>Other studies in this piece show that losing sleep can nudge people to consume junk food the following day.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>“So in men, short sleep promotes greater appetite and desire to eat, and in women, there is less of a signal that makes you stop eating,” — Dr. St-Onge</span></p>

								<p><b><i>My two cents</i></b><span>: There’s nothing more true than the positive loop that sleep provides. It’s sort of crazy to think about how a quality night of sleep triggers more energy the following day. More energy allows you to be more productive/active, which will probably get you to eat healthier. Healthy eating makes you sleep better and the loop goes on and on. </span></p>

</header>

<p>Some time ago, I wrote a blog post about how <a href="https://www.ralfj.de/blog/2018/07/24/pointers-and-bytes.html">there’s more to a pointer than meets the eye</a>.
One key point I was trying to make is that</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>just because two pointers point to the same address, does not mean they are equal in the sense that they can be used interchangeably.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>This “extra information” that distinguishes different pointers to the same address is typically called <a href="https://rust-lang.github.io/unsafe-code-guidelines/glossary.html#pointer-provenance"><em>provenance</em></a>.
This post is another attempt to convince you that provenance is “real”, by telling a cautionary tale of what can go wrong when provenance is not considered sufficiently carefully in an optimizing compiler.
The post is self-contained; I am not assuming that you have read the first one.
There is also a larger message here about how we could prevent such issues from coming up in the future by spending more effort on the specification of compiler IRs.</p>

<!-- MORE -->

<p>Below, I will show a series of three compiler transformations that each seem “intuitively justified”, but when taken together they lead to a clearly incorrect result.
I will use LLVM for these examples, but the goal is not to pick on LLVM—other compilers suffer from similar issues.
The goal is to convince you that to build a correct compiler for languages permitting unsafe pointer manipulation such as C, C++, or Rust,
we need to take IR semantics (and specifically provenance) more seriously.
I use LLVM for the examples because it is particularly easy to study with its single, extensively-documented IR that a lot of infrastructure evolved around.
Let’s get started!</p>

<h2 id="warm-up-why-irs-need-a-precise-semantics">Warm-up: Why IRs need a precise semantics</h2>

<p>As a warm-up, I will give a simple example showing that compiler IRs such as LLVM IR need a precise (and precisely documented) semantics.
If you are already familiar with the idea of treating compiler IRs as proper programming languages in their own right, or if you are just here for the pointers and their provenance, you can skip to the next section.</p>

<p>Consider the following simple (and contrived, for the sake of this example) piece of C code computing <code>n * (i+j)</code>:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="c"><span>int</span> <span>sum_up</span><span>(</span><span>int</span> <span>i</span><span>,</span> <span>int</span> <span>j</span><span>,</span> <span>unsigned</span> <span>int</span> <span>n</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>int</span> <span>result</span> <span>=</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span>
  <span>while</span> <span>(</span><span>n</span> <span>&gt;</span> <span>0</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>result</span> <span>+=</span> <span>i</span> <span>+</span> <span>j</span><span>;</span>
    <span>n</span> <span>-=</span> <span>1</span><span>;</span>
  <span>}</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>result</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>One transformation the compiler might want to do is to move the addition <code>i+j</code> out of the loop, to avoid computing the sum each time around the loop (this is called “loop-invariant code motion”<sup id="fnref:loop" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:loop">1</a></sup>):</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="c"><span>int</span> <span>sum_up</span><span>(</span><span>int</span> <span>i</span><span>,</span> <span>int</span> <span>j</span><span>,</span> <span>unsigned</span> <span>int</span> <span>n</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span> <span>// optimized version</span>
  <span>int</span> <span>result</span> <span>=</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span>
  <span>int</span> <span>s</span> <span>=</span> <span>i</span> <span>+</span> <span>j</span><span>;</span>
  <span>while</span> <span>(</span><span>n</span> <span>&gt;</span> <span>0</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>result</span> <span>+=</span> <span>s</span><span>;</span>
    <span>n</span> <span>-=</span> <span>1</span><span>;</span>
  <span>}</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>result</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>However, that transformation is actually incorrect.
If we imagine a caller using this function as <code>sum_up(INT_MAX, 1, 0)</code>, then this is a perfectly correct way to call <code>sum_up</code>: the loop is never entered, so the overflowing addition <code>INT_MAX+1</code> is never performed.
However, after the desired optimization, the program now causes a signed integer overflow, which is UB (Undefined Behavior) and thus May Never Happen!</p>

<p>One might be tempted to ignore this problem because the UB on integer overflow is a compiler-only concept; every target supported by the compiler will do the obvious thing and just produce an overflowing result.
However, there might be other compiler passes running after the optimization we are considering.
One such pass might inline <code>sum_up</code>, and another pass might notice the <code>INT_MAX+1</code> and replace it by <code>unreachable</code> since UB code is “by definition” unreachable, and another pass might then just remove all our code since it is unreachable.
Each of these passes has a good reason to exist (it can help real code become a lot faster or help prune dead code), but if we combine them all with loop-invariant code motion, the result is a disaster.</p>

<p>One way (and the only systematic way I know) to avoid such problems is to make sure that we can justify the correctness of each optimization <em>in isolation</em>.
Each optimization must be <em>correct</em> for any possible program, where <em>correct</em> means that the optimized program must only “do things” that the original program could have done as well.
(This is basically the “as-if” rule in the C standard, and is typically called “refinement” in the academic literature.)
In particular, no optimization must ever introduce UB into a UB-free program.</p>

<p>It may seem now that under this premise, it is impossible to perform the loop-invariant code motion we are considering.
But that is not the case!
So far, what we have seen is that the optimization is not <em>correct</em> when being performed on a C program.
But when LLVM performs these optimizations, it does not consider the program to be written in C—it considers the program to be written in LLVM IR, which has a different semantics than C.
Specifically, the <a href="https://llvm.org/docs/LangRef.html">LLVM LangRef</a> says that signed integer overflow in LLVM IR yields a <code>poison</code> value.
It is not UB to produce <code>poison</code>, it is just UB to use <code>poison</code> in certain ways (the details of this do not matter here).
In a call to the optimized <code>sum_up(INT_MAX, 1, 0)</code>, the <code>s</code> variable introduced by loop-invariant code motion is unused, so the fact that its value is <code>poison</code> does not matter!</p>

<p>Due to this behavior of signed integer overflow, this case of loop-invariant code motion is <em>correct</em> if we consider it as an optimization on programs that are written in LLVM IR.<sup id="fnref:cheat" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:cheat">2</a></sup>
The “price” we pay for this is that replacing <code>INT_MAX+1</code> by <code>unreachable</code> is not <em>correct</em> in LLVM IR, since it is not UB.</p>

<p>The great thing about <em>correct</em> optimizations is that we can combine any number of them in any order (such as inlining, replacing definite UB by <code>unreachable</code>, and removing unreachable code), and we can be sure that the result obtained after all these optimizations is a correct compilation of our original program.
(In the academic lingo, we would say that “refinement is transitive”.)</p>

<p>However, to make the argument that an optimization is <em>correct</em>, the exact semantics of LLVM IR (what the behavior of all possible programs is and when they have UB) needs to be documented.
All involved optimizations need to exactly agree on what is and is not UB, to ensure that whatever code they produce will not be considered UB by a later optimization.
This is exactly what we also expect from the specification of a programming language such as C, which is why I think we should consider compiler IRs as proper programming languages in their own right, and specify them with the same diligence as we would specify “normal” languages.<sup id="fnref:ub-difference" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:ub-difference">3</a></sup>
Sure, no human is going to write many programs in LLVM IR, so their syntax barely matters, but clang and rustc produce LLVM IR programs all the time, and as we have seen understanding the exact rules governing the behavior of programs is crucial to ensuring that the optimizations LLVM performs do not change program behavior.</p>

<p><em>Take-away:</em> If we want to be able to justify the correctness of a compiler in a modular way, considering only one optimization at a time, we need to perform these optimizations in an IR that has a precise specification of all aspects of program behavior, including UB.
Then we can, for each optimization separately, consider the question: does the optimization ever change program behavior, and does it ever introduce UB into UB-free programs?
For a <em>correct</em> optimization, the answer to these questions is “no”.</p>

<h2 id="how-3-seemingly-correct-optimizations-can-be-incorrect-when-used-together">How 3 (seemingly) correct optimizations can be incorrect when used together</h2>

<p>With the warm-up done, we are now ready to consider some more tricky optimizations, which we will use to explore the question of how precise a language specification needs to be.
We will look at three different optimizations LLVM can perform, and I will show that they <em>cannot all be correct</em> since the first and last program we are considering actually have <em>different behavior</em>.
(More precisely: the last program has a possible behavior that was not possible for the first program.)
This is only possible if at least one optimization changed program behavior in an incorrect way, but it is actually not entirely clear which optimization is the culprit.</p>

<p>The sequence of examples is taken from <a href="https://sf.snu.ac.kr/llvmtwin/files/presentation.pdf#page=32">this talk</a> by Chung-Kil Hur; it was discovered while working on a mathematically rigorous specification of LLVM.</p>

<p>Here is the source program:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="c"><span>char</span> <span>p</span><span>[</span><span>1</span><span>],</span> <span>q</span><span>[</span><span>1</span><span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span><span>0</span><span>};</span>
<span>uintptr_t</span> <span>ip</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>uintptr_t</span><span>)(</span><span>p</span><span>+</span><span>1</span><span>);</span>
<span>uintptr_t</span> <span>iq</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>uintptr_t</span><span>)</span><span>q</span><span>;</span>
<span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>iq</span> <span>==</span> <span>ip</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>*</span><span>(</span><span>char</span><span>*</span><span>)</span><span>iq</span> <span>=</span> <span>10</span><span>;</span>
  <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>q</span><span>[</span><span>0</span><span>]);</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>I am using C syntax here just as a convenient way to write programs in LLVM IR.</p>

<p>This program has two possible behaviors: either <code>ip</code> (the address one-past-the-end of <code>p</code>) and <code>iq</code> (the address of <code>q</code>) are different, and nothing is printed.
Or the two are equal, in which case the program will print “10” (<code>iq</code> is the result of casting <code>q</code> to an integer, so casting it back will yield the original pointer, or at least a pointer pointing to the same object / location in memory).</p>

<p>The first “optimization” we will perform is to exploit that if we enter the <code>if</code> body, we have <code>iq == ip</code>, so we can replace all <code>iq</code> by <code>ip</code>.
Subsequently the definition of <code>ip</code> is inlined:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="c"><span>char</span> <span>p</span><span>[</span><span>1</span><span>],</span> <span>q</span><span>[</span><span>1</span><span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span><span>0</span><span>};</span>
<span>uintptr_t</span> <span>ip</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>uintptr_t</span><span>)(</span><span>p</span><span>+</span><span>1</span><span>);</span>
<span>uintptr_t</span> <span>iq</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>uintptr_t</span><span>)</span><span>q</span><span>;</span>
<span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>iq</span> <span>==</span> <span>ip</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>*</span><span>(</span><span>char</span><span>*</span><span>)(</span><span>uintptr_t</span><span>)(</span><span>p</span><span>+</span><span>1</span><span>)</span> <span>=</span> <span>10</span><span>;</span> <span>// &lt;- This line changed</span>
  <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>q</span><span>[</span><span>0</span><span>]);</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>The second optimization notices that we are taking a pointer <code>p+1</code>, casting it to an integer, and casting it back, so we can remove the cast roundtrip:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="c"><span>char</span> <span>p</span><span>[</span><span>1</span><span>],</span> <span>q</span><span>[</span><span>1</span><span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span><span>0</span><span>};</span>
<span>uintptr_t</span> <span>ip</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>uintptr_t</span><span>)(</span><span>p</span><span>+</span><span>1</span><span>);</span>
<span>uintptr_t</span> <span>iq</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>uintptr_t</span><span>)</span><span>q</span><span>;</span>
<span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>iq</span> <span>==</span> <span>ip</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>*</span><span>(</span><span>p</span><span>+</span><span>1</span><span>)</span> <span>=</span> <span>10</span><span>;</span> <span>// &lt;- This line changed</span>
  <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>q</span><span>[</span><span>0</span><span>]);</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>The final optimization notices that <code>q</code> is never written to, so we can replace <code>q[0]</code> by its initial value <code>0</code>:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="c"><span>char</span> <span>p</span><span>[</span><span>1</span><span>],</span> <span>q</span><span>[</span><span>1</span><span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span><span>0</span><span>};</span>
<span>uintptr_t</span> <span>ip</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>uintptr_t</span><span>)(</span><span>p</span><span>+</span><span>1</span><span>);</span>
<span>uintptr_t</span> <span>iq</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>uintptr_t</span><span>)</span><span>q</span><span>;</span>
<span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>iq</span> <span>==</span> <span>ip</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>*</span><span>(</span><span>p</span><span>+</span><span>1</span><span>)</span> <span>=</span> <span>10</span><span>;</span>
  <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>0</span><span>);</span> <span>// &lt;- This line changed</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>However, this final program is different from the first one!
Specifically, the final program will either print nothing or print “0”, while the original program <em>could never print “0”</em>.
This shows that the sequence of three optimizations we performed, as a whole, is <em>not correct</em>.</p>

      <p><strong>Depression is a mental disorder that affects more than 264 million people of all ages worldwide. Understanding its mechanisms is vital for the development of effective therapeutic strategies. Scientists from the Institut Pasteur, Inserm and the CNRS recently conducted a study showing that an imbalance in the gut bacterial community can cause a reduction in some metabolites, resulting in depressive-like behaviors.&nbsp; These findings, which show that a healthy gut microbiota contributes to normal brain function, were published in <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-19931-2" target="_blank"><em>Nature Communications</em></a> on December 11, 2020.</strong></p>
<p>The bacterial population in the gut, known as the gut microbiota, is the largest reservoir of bacteria in the body. Research has increasingly shown that the host and the gut microbiota are an excellent example of systems with mutually beneficial interactions. Recent observations also revealed a link between mood disorders and damage to the gut microbiota. This was demonstrated by a consortium of scientists from the Institut Pasteur, the CNRS and Inserm, who identified a correlation between the gut microbiota and the efficacy of fluoxetine, a molecule frequently used as an antidepressant. But some of the mechanisms governing depression, the leading cause of disability worldwide, remained unknown.</p>
<p>Using animal models, scientists recently discovered that a change to the gut microbiota brought about by chronic stress can lead to depressive-like behaviors, in particular by causing a reduction in lipid metabolites (small molecules resulting from metabolism) in the blood and the brain.</p>
<p>These lipid metabolites, known as endogenous cannabinoids (or endocannabinoids), coordinate a communication system in the body which is significantly hindered by the reduction in metabolites.</p>

<p><em><span>© Pascal Marseaud</span></em></p>
<p>Endocannabinoids bind to receptors that are also the main target of THC, the most widely known active component of cannabis. The scientists discovered that an absence of endocannabinoids in the hippocampus, a key brain region involved in the formation of memories and emotions, resulted in depressive-like behaviors.</p>
<p>The scientists obtained these results by studying the microbiotas of healthy animals and animals with mood disorders. As Pierre-Marie Lledo, Head of the Perception and Memory Unit at the Institut Pasteur (CNRS/Institut Pasteur) and joint last author of the study, explains: "<em>Surprisingly, simply transferring the microbiota from an animal with mood disorders to an animal in good health was enough to bring about biochemical changes and confer depressive-like behaviors in the latter.</em>"</p>
<p>The scientists identified some bacterial species that are significantly reduced in animals with mood disorders. They then demonstrated that an oral treatment with the same bacteria restored normal levels of lipid derivatives, thereby alleviating the depressive-like behaviors. These bacteria could therefore serve as an antidepressant. Such treatments are known as "psychobiotics."</p>
<p>"<em>This discovery shows the role played by the gut microbiota in normal brain function</em>," continues Gérard Eberl, Head of the Microenvironment and Immunity Unit (Institut Pasteur/Inserm) and joint last author of the study. If there is an imbalance in the gut bacterial community, some lipids that are vital for brain function disappear, encouraging the emergence of depressive-like behaviors. In this particular case, the use of specific bacteria could be a promising method for restoring a healthy microbiota and treating mood disorders more effectively.<br>&nbsp;</p>

<p>In its iPhone app, Spotify teaches you that swiping right on a song will queue that song.

So imagine you are in the car, looking at your song, displayed basically the same as it's displayed on the album screen, where you can swipe right, but you cannot swipe right.</p><p>Worse, if you try to swipe right it will immediately play the song, interrupting your current song and queue. This has bitten me many times in the car, where carefully queued songs are hard-interrupted to play a song I meant to queue. It's jarring and annoying for driver and passengers alike.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div> <p>There have been a lot of visual motion illusions going around Twitter recently. I think it is super cool that people find these motion demos so compelling. However, I’ve been surprised to see lots of claims that there is “no motion” in the illusions and most people seem to think there’s some perceptual magic going on.</p> <p>What is this magic?</p> <h2 id="for-example-this-crazy-mario-illusion">For example, this crazy mario illusion</h2> <p>The marios look like they’re moving throughout the level, but each mario never gets anywhere. It’s really quite upsetting.</p> <video autoplay="" loop="" muted="" src="https://jake.vision/motionillusionblog/marioReversePhi.mp4"></video> <p>A number of people have expressed wonder at this example, pointing out that “nothing is actually moving”.</p>  <p>And it follows in a whole series of really clever illusions that use the same effect, but are often designed to mislead the observer.</p>  <h2 id="how-do-these-illusions-work">How do these illusions work?</h2> <p>I thought this was a good opportunity to write up a little blog post about visual motion. Let’s take this Mario example here and look at what’s actually going on.</p> <h3 id="but-first-what-is-motion">But first, what is motion?</h3> <p>Motion is <strong>change in position over time</strong>.</p> <p>Something that does not move is static because it has the same position as time progresses. We often think of motion in the real world: furniture does not change position over time (does not move). You, your dog, all animals, your limbs, all change position over time. So, they move in the world.</p> <p>However, from the perspective from your visual system (or a video camera), motion isn’t so straightforward. For example, if I were to pan a camera across a room, the room would be moving with respect to the reference frame of the camera. That is motion as well. In other words, <strong>visual motion is not just a result of things moving in the world, but can also result from the sensor moving</strong>.</p> <p>So, what is visual motion and how do we see it? Let’s take the idea of something changing position over time in the real world and apply it to the pixels of a movie. You’ll see this makes sense in a minute. Here’s a video of a real moving thing swinging.</p> <video autoplay="" loop="" muted="" src="https://jake.vision/motionillusionblog/orangutanVid.mp4"></video> <p>from <a href="https://giphy.com/search/monkey-swing">Giphy</a></p> <p>What makes this a video of a moving thing? Well, if we look at different frames, we can see the position of the orangutan has moved over time.</p> <div> <div> <p><span> <strong>Video</strong> at frame <strong>1</strong> </span> </p> <p><img alt="Orangutan swinging" src="https://jake.vision/motionillusionblog/orangGifAsImg.jpeg"> </p> </div> </div> <p>That tells us that the orangutan has moved, even with a fixed reference frame (the camera has not moved). Therefore the orangutan has moved in the real world.</p> <p>One way to visualize this would be to <strong>plot the pixel values over time to see how they change</strong>. Since we cannot plot every frame at all time points, let’s take a slice through space and look how that slice changes over time. You can move your mouse (scrub) over the 2D image frame to see different space-time slices.</p> <p>Scrub over the space-time slice to play through time in the movie. It won’t be intuitive at first, but there is a mapping from the motion of objects in the images to the patterns in the space x time slices. Specifically, motion is orientation…</p> <div> <div> <div> <div>  <div> <p><img alt="The video" src="https://jake.vision/motionillusionblog/orangGifAsImg.jpeg"> </p>  </div> </div> <div> <p><span> <strong>Slices through time</strong> at vertical position <span> 0 </span> </span> </p> <div> <div> <p><img alt="Slices of the video" src="https://jake.vision/motionillusionblog/buckets.jpg"> </p>  </div>  </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <p>Track the body of the orangutan and the branch. You can see that the movement of the orangutan and the branch form slanted structure in the space-time plots, whereas the background looks like vertical streaks.</p> <p><img alt="Orangutan Space-time Annotations" src="https://jake.vision/motionillusionblog/orangannotated.png"></p><p>It’s a little tricky to see at first, but it’s clear which things are moving and which are not. All of the slanted (or “oriented”) stuff in the space-time slice is stuff that’s moving. In other words, we can define “Visual Motion” as orientation in space-time.</p> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Vertical structure</strong> in space-time does not move.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Horizontal structure</strong> in space-time, such as the edge of the leaves here, are appearances and disappearances.</p> </li> </ul> <p>The TLDR of this whole post is: <strong>Our visual system detects orientation in space-time to see motion using little local detectors.</strong></p> <p>But before we get into that, what’s happening with the Marios? Is there orientation there as well?</p> <h2 id="whats-happening-with-the-marios">What’s happening with the marios?</h2> <p>Above, we built a quick intuition for how visual motion is really just orientation in space-time. Let’s zoom in on a single Mario to see what happens if we use the same trick. Here is a single mario. It appears to be moving to the right, but it never leaves the frame. This is the essential component of the illusion.</p> <video autoplay="" loop="" muted="" src="https://jake.vision/motionillusionblog/MarioCropped.mp4"></video> <p>If we take a slice through this mario, we can use the intuitions we learned above to see what’s going on. In this figure, time is running up.</p> <div> <div> <div> <div>  <div> <p><img alt="The video" src="https://jake.vision/motionillusionblog/mariocrop_GifAsImg.jpeg"> </p>  </div> </div> <div> <p><span> <strong>Slices through time</strong> at vertical position <span> 0 </span> </span> </p> <div> <div> <p><img alt="Slices of the video" src="https://jake.vision/motionillusionblog/mariocrop_buckets.jpeg"> </p>  </div>  </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <p>First, the mario is flashing different colors. That appears as horizontal rainbow-colored lines. Horizontal structure in space-time plots (where time runs up or down) is something appearing or disappearing (or, flashing!).</p> <p>Second, in this view, we can clearly see where the motion comes from. There is oriented structure on the edges of the marios. Although there is a hard edge between the colors and the gray that is vertical (and therefore does not move), the colors are oriented at the edge.</p> <p><img alt="Annotated Space-time slice" src="https://jake.vision/motionillusionblog/coloredgeannotated.png"></p><p><strong>The color has nothing to do with the illusion</strong> - let’s rid of it for now because it’s just a distraction. Here you’ll see the same Mario in grayscale (I’ve just averaged across the color channels) and you can still see the effect.</p> <video autoplay="" loop="" muted="" src="https://jake.vision/motionillusionblog/MarioGray.mp4"></video> <p>From here, we can construct a really simple illusion that follows the same principles. We’ll build an image that represents space-time and then play it back as a 2D movie.</p> <p>The image I’ll make here is constructed using the same principle as the Mario’s edge. The center is modulated in brightness, just like the Mario’s color was modulated. The edges drift to the right for 5 frames and then jump back to the start. At each jump, the sign inverts and the cycle starts again. Before scrolling down, <strong>try to imagine what this looks like if we played it as a movie</strong>.</p> <p><img alt="Constructed Space Time Slice" src="https://jake.vision/motionillusionblog/constructedspacetime.png"></p><p>Since there is only 1D space in our image from above, we don’t have a 2D image at each time point. But, we can visualize that 1D info as vertical bars.</p> <p>Here’s a single frame of our new illusion.</p> <p><img alt="Constructed Space Time Frame" src="https://jake.vision/motionillusionblog/constructedframe.png"></p><p>And here’s the full movie of our space-time constructed object.</p> <div> <div> <div> <div>  <div> <p><img alt="The video" src="https://jake.vision/motionillusionblog/1Dbars_GifAsImg.jpeg"> </p>  </div> </div> <div> <p><span> <strong>Slices through time</strong> at vertical position <span> 0 </span> </span> </p> <div> <div> <p><img alt="Slices of the video" src="https://jake.vision/motionillusionblog/1Dbars_buckets.jpeg"> </p>  </div>  </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <p>If we look back at the space-time construction again, we can see something interesting. There is an edge moving to the right, but it keeps jumping back and changing sign (white is on ones side and black on the other and then it flips).</p> <p><img alt="Orangutan Space-time Annotations" src="https://jake.vision/motionillusionblog/grayedgesannotated.png"></p><p>But we keep seeing motion to the right. <strong>This tells us something: our visual motion system doesn’t care about the sign of that edge.</strong> The lingo that vision scientists use to talk about this is <em>motion perception doesn’t care about phase</em> (for the purposes of this blog post, phase is just the exact sign and position of that edge).</p> <p>In other words, <strong>motion perception only cares about the orientation</strong>, not the stuff it’s made of. And that’s pretty neat.</p> <p>Next, let’s look at an old model of visual motion processing with this property.</p> <h2 id="the-motion-energy-model">The motion energy model</h2> <p>Let’s look at the state-of-the-art in human motion perception (in the mid 1980s), also known as the ”<a href="http://persci.mit.edu/pub_pdfs/spatio85.pdf" rel="nofollow">motion energy model</a>”. This is really a beautiful paper, so I recommend anyone interest click in and take the time to read it. Also, not all that much has changed in our understanding of the fundamentals in the last 35 years.</p> <p>So, how does human motion detectors work? Adelson and Bergen start by making the same point that was demonstrated above: visual motion is orientation in space-time. Panel <strong>a</strong> shows a frame of a movie with a bar moving to the right (like our orangutan, above). <strong>b</strong> shows the full spatiotemporal volume of the bar moving through space and time as if it were continuously moving. But, of course, movies have frames and a frame rate. Panel <strong>c</strong> shows the same volume, but now it reflects the frame rate of a movie.</p> <p><img alt="Motion as edge orientation" src="https://jake.vision/motionillusionblog/AdelsonBergenMotionOrientation.png"></p><p>From here, it makes sense to think about how to build detectors for motion. The picture below shows that if you had an oriented filter in space time, you could detect the edge. For the non-scientists reading this, you can think of these filters like little “edge detectors”. These types of oriented filters are decent enough descriptions of the responses of neurons in visual cortex. For example, here’s a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw5PKV9Rj3o&amp;feature=emb_title" rel="nofollow">link to a video</a> of what Hubel and Wiesel found in their classic expriments on primary visual cortex, which they concluded looks like a little line (or edge) detector.</p> <p><img alt="Motion as edge detectors" src="https://jake.vision/motionillusionblog/AdelsonBergenEdgeDetector.png"> Importantly, these edge detectors still care about the sign of the edge. This, as we noted above, is unlike our percept. To build detectors that do not care about phase (don't care about the polarity of the edge). We can combine two oriented filters that care about opposite signs. In technical terms, these filters are 90° out of phase, forming a "Quadrature Pair". Really don't worry about that jargon. This just means that where one filter *likes* white, the other *likes* black (and vice versa). <img alt="Phase-invariant filters" src="https://jake.vision/motionillusionblog/AdelsonBergenQpair.png"></p><blockquote> <p>Note: A very <a href="https://www.osapublishing.org/DirectPDFAccess/4E69228F-07D1-9374-DF04DF81D3560F3A_1949/josaa-2-2-322.pdf?da=1&amp;id=1949&amp;seq=0&amp;mobile=no" rel="nofollow">related paper</a> from Watson and Ahumada came out in the same year and covers many of the same points.</p> </blockquote> <p>Using the equations from Adelson and Bergen, 1985, we can make the same little motion energy filters. Note: in my visualization below, time runs up.</p> <p>The two filters on the right are selective to and edge moving to the right and are 90° out of phase with eachother. The two filters on the left are selective to a leftward moving edge and are 90° out of phase with each other.</p> <p><img alt="Phase-invariant filters for left and right" src="https://jake.vision/motionillusionblog/adelsonOrientedFilters.png"></p><p>Here’s a movie of what these look like:</p> <video autoplay="" loop="" muted="" src="https://jake.vision/motionillusionblog/motEfilters.mp4"></video> <p>Let’s pause for a second here and take note of two things:</p> <ol> <li>These little movies look a lot like what the edges of the marios do. So, <strong>contrary to the claim that the marios are “not moving” they are, in fact, made up of the fundamental elements of motion</strong>.</li> <li>Derivatives</li> </ol> <h3 id="what-derivatives">What? Derivatives?</h3> <p>How did Adelson and Bergen make these little moving edge detectors? Well, the key underlying component is the concept of a derivative. The spatial selectivity of these filters was created by taking the 1st and 2nd derivatives of a Gaussian.</p> <p>The first idea to get across is that derivatives detect change (that’s basically the definition). The derivative of a function <span><span></span></span> is how much the function value (<span><span></span></span>) changes for really small changes in <span><span></span></span>. That <span><span></span></span> just means “tiny changes in x”.</p> <p>Intuitively then, …</p></div></div>

<p>The Share Festival is an annual highlight of the electronic arts and tech policy scene that flits between Turiin and Belgrade, full of awesome, weird and startling art and theory.</p>

<p>This year's festival is (of course) all online, and it kicked off yesterday with a streamed concert from experimental music acts Pietra Tonale, Comet, Audiohacklab and Noise Delivery. It will end with Artmaker V, the latest iteration of a longrunning generative art project.</p>
<p>On the side-stages there's stuff like Fablabkids, a partnership with Maker Faire Torino for kids 5-14. More English-language info on Bruce Sterling's Tumblr:</p>

<p>Bardcore is medievalist hiphop music, scored with traditional(ish) instruments. The delightfully named Beedle the Bardcore (AKA Elise Roth) has a Youtube channel that's a treasure-trove of medieval hip-hop covers.</p>

<p>Roth's just released the video for WELL-ARMED PEASANTS, a tribute to Megan Thee Stallion and Cardi B's WAP, and it's just fantastic.</p>

<p>Well-Armed Peasants is music to sharpen your pichfork by, and features historically accurate disses of the Magna Carta as a vastly overrated historical irrelevance:</p>

<blockquote><p>
  Art thou overtaxing well-armed peasants?<br>
  Bring a pitchforik and a torch cause we're well-armed peasants</p>
<p>  Enough's enough we've captured thy bride,<br>
  Time to abide as we plot thy regicide</p>
<p>  We'll tie you up, and I advise,<br>
  Shut thy mouth thou art despised,<br>
  We're gonna hang, draw and quarter you,<br>
  From thy codpiece up to thine eyes</p>
<p>  Hide thy crown and thy coat,<br>
  For we're well-armed peasants,<br>
  Dare thy knights for half a groat,<br>
  Because we're well-armed peasants.
</p></blockquote>
<p>This pairs <em>very</em> well with Penelope Scott's Silicon Valley disillusionment song RÄT:</p>

				<h2 id="i">I</h2><p>In this small addendum to my essay <em><a href="https://limitlesscuriosity.com/the-story-of-covid-19-in-sweden/">The Story of COVID-19 in Sweden</a>,</em> we want to look at a very surprising statistic: the number of annual deaths in Sweden.</p><figure><img src="https://limitlesscuriosity.com/content/images/2020/12/Screenshot_2020-12-14_at_00.13.38.png" alt="" srcset="https://limitlesscuriosity.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/12/Screenshot_2020-12-14_at_00.13.38.png 600w, https://limitlesscuriosity.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/12/Screenshot_2020-12-14_at_00.13.38.png 1000w, https://limitlesscuriosity.com/content/images/2020/12/Screenshot_2020-12-14_at_00.13.38.png 1402w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption><a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/525353/sweden-number-of-deaths/"><em>Number of deaths in Sweden from 2010 to 2020</em></a></figcaption></figure><p>You can find the original excel file published by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics_Sweden">SCB</a>—the official government agency for statistics in Sweden—<a href="https://www.scb.se/en/About-us/news-and-press-releases/statistics-sweden-to-publish-preliminary-statistics-on-deaths-in-sweden/">here</a>. The most striking aspect of these figures is, of course, the fact that there were no more deaths in Sweden this year than in any other year. (The year is not over yet, but it is almost impossible that the number of deaths will increase so much that 2020 will be a year with significantly more deaths.) And remember, Sweden did not have lockdowns nor mandatory mask laws.</p><h2 id="ii">II</h2><p>I got the idea to look at the Sweden’s annual deaths statistic because a friend of mine showed me the <a href="https://www.destatis.de/DE/Themen/Querschnitt/Corona/_Grafik/_Interaktiv/woechentliche-sterbefallzahlen-jahre.html?nn=209016">same statistic for Germany</a>. In Germany, as in Sweden, the number of deaths this year is not higher than in other years, but for Germany, this fact could <em>theoretically</em> be explained by lockdowns and masks. Not so for Sweden.</p><p>Someone I showed these figures to suggested that although masks were not mandatory in Sweden, perhaps everyone wore them anyway. To me, this idea immediately sounded ridiculous, and it looks like I was right.</p><p><a href="http://www.coviddatahub.com/">A survey</a> asking participants whether they wore face masks in the last seven days to protect themselves from COVID-19 found that, for example, at the end of April, in the middle of the first COVID-19 wave, 82% of Swedes never wore a face mask. This is in stark contrast to, say, Germany, where only 8% did not wear a mask.</p><figure><img src="https://limitlesscuriosity.com/content/images/2020/12/Screenshot_2020-12-14_at_00.26.08.png" alt="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/3034b31e-bf36-4d94-a52e-c9532b9465dc/Screenshot_2020-12-14_at_00.26.08.png" srcset="https://limitlesscuriosity.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/12/Screenshot_2020-12-14_at_00.26.08.png 600w, https://limitlesscuriosity.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/12/Screenshot_2020-12-14_at_00.26.08.png 1000w, https://limitlesscuriosity.com/content/images/2020/12/Screenshot_2020-12-14_at_00.26.08.png 1440w"></figure><p>The latest survey—November 9. - 15.—tells the same story.</p><figure><img src="https://limitlesscuriosity.com/content/images/2020/12/Screenshot_2020-12-14_at_12.25.54.png" alt="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/668bfaf9-ce60-4785-85e8-88f20cad8fa1/Screenshot_2020-12-14_at_12.25.54.png" srcset="https://limitlesscuriosity.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/12/Screenshot_2020-12-14_at_12.25.54.png 600w, https://limitlesscuriosity.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/12/Screenshot_2020-12-14_at_12.25.54.png 1000w, https://limitlesscuriosity.com/content/images/2020/12/Screenshot_2020-12-14_at_12.25.54.png 1428w"></figure><p>If you look at this statistic throughout the year, you will see that in Sweden, almost nobody wore face masks, while in Germany, almost everyone did. So what is going on here? How can they not wear masks without a high number of annual deaths? Where are those <a href="https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/country/sweden/">7,500 COVID-19 deaths</a>?</p><h2 id="iii">III</h2><p>To get a better picture of what happened in Sweden, we need to look at the <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1115707/sweden-number-of-deaths-per-week/">weekly number of deaths</a>.</p><figure><img src="https://limitlesscuriosity.com/content/images/2020/12/Screenshot_2020-12-14_at_13.23.47.png" alt="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/3af0303f-5d7a-4975-8ac0-2900d83b954b/Screenshot_2020-12-14_at_13.23.47.png" srcset="https://limitlesscuriosity.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/12/Screenshot_2020-12-14_at_13.23.47.png 600w, https://limitlesscuriosity.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/12/Screenshot_2020-12-14_at_13.23.47.png 1000w, https://limitlesscuriosity.com/content/images/2020/12/Screenshot_2020-12-14_at_13.23.47.png 1342w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption><a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1115707/sweden-number-of-deaths-per-week/"><em>Average daily number of deaths per week in Sweden in 2020, compared to the average daily number of deaths per week from 2015 to 2019</em></a></figcaption></figure><p>As you can see here, the first half of 2020 was an exceptionally deadly year. After that, and especially now, Sweden compares favorably with other years.</p><p>My explanation for this is simple: most people who would normally have died in the winter from viruses and diseases—especially the flu—died in the spring from COVID-19. This can happen because the groups at risk from these viruses appear to be similar. However, for my explanation to be true, (1) the number of influenza deaths in Sweden would have to be lower than in other years, and (2) COVID-19 would have to have a case-fatality rate (CFR) that is in the ballpark of influenza.</p><p>Requirement number one fits the data from other countries like the U.S., where flu deaths have dropped by two-thirds, as this New York Post article titled <em><a href="https://nypost.com/2020/10/24/drop-in-flu-deaths-may-indicate-that-most-at-risk-died-from-covid-19/">Drop in flu deaths may indicate that most at risk died from COVID-19</a></em> states:</p><blockquote>Flu deaths are down two-thirds from the five-year average, a drop that could indicate the most vulnerable Americans died in the first wave of COVID-19.</blockquote><p>If anyone can find good data on the number of deaths from influenza and other diseases for 2020 in Sweden, I would greatly appreciate a comment or Twitter DM.</p><p>Condition number two—the low CFR—is something I discussed in my other <a href="https://limitlesscuriosity.com/the-story-of-covid-19-in-sweden/">essay</a>. It is still not clear how deadly COVID-19 really is, but estimates are getting lower every time new data comes in, so I do not think this is unlikely.</p><h2 id="iv">IV</h2><p>Whatever the explanation for the low number of annual deaths, it seems that Sweden has done “fine” without lockdowns and masks. Something I think few people would have expected, given how things are portrayed in the media—but that's a different essay. If you have another, perhaps better, explanation for these figures, feel free to suggest it in the comments.</p><p>And as always, thank you for reading my essay.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2 id="intro">Intro</h2><p>It is a general phenomenon among humans (I mean our brain) to not notice things which are similar. You might understand this article better if you start looking at things a different way.</p><p>I come from a Java background. I’ve used them only for competitive programing when I was in my university, so I had no idea what interfaces were, although Java supported them. I always confused them with classes and it kept me up at night. I just couldn’t understand what the heck they were!</p><p>I’ll try my best to explain what interfaces in Go are, assuming you’re five years old.</p><p><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" data-src="https://media.giphy.com/media/WsNbxuFkLi3IuGI9NU/giphy-downsized.gif" width="300" height="250"></p><p>Let’s take an example of two things that float on water like oil and ice.</p><p><img data-src="../../images/golang-interfaces/oilwater.png" width="60%" src="https://g14a.github.io/images/golang-interfaces/oilwater.png"></p><p>Why do they float on water? You would probably say the following.</p><ul><li>Both of them are less dense compared to water.</li></ul><p>This means both of them satisfy the same condition. So let’s say <code>floatable</code> is the requirement or the condition for a material in order to float on water.</p><p>Now let’s understand this in terms of Go where we simulate the oil and ice example.</p><p>Cambridge Dictionary defines interface as “to communicate between two things and affect each other.”</p><p><code>FloatableEntity</code> defines an interface and then we have our condition <code>floatable</code> that is to be satisfied.</p><div><p><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1

</pre></td><td><pre><span>type</span> <span>FloatableEntity</span> <span>interface</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>floatable</span><span>()</span> 
<span>}</span>
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></p></div><p>Now oil and ice might have different properties like BP, viscocity etc.</p><div><p><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1

    <span>Color</span> <span>string</span>
<span>}</span>
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></p></div><p>But unless both of them have a <code>floatable</code> signature, they don’t implement <code>FloatableEntity</code></p><div><p><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1

<span>}</span>
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></p></div><p>Well, this is not a topic of conversation for me with a five year old but I hope you understood what interfaces are. Let’s see how they’re used in writing web apps.</p><h2 id="practical-usage-of-interfaces"><strong>Practical usage of interfaces</strong></h2><p>When a client at work says “We need an application which can take user’s sign up data and then store it in a database”, he doesn’t specify what database he needs for e.g. Mongo or Postgres. All he needs, is his user information stored somewhere.</p><p><strong>So according to him, if an entity stores something like a database, retrieves it like a database, and lets him edit it like a database, it is a database.</strong></p><p>Let’s say you’re dealing with two kinds of databases. You have some user information which you obtain from your HTTP handler, and then you try to store it in both MongoDB and PostgreSQL. Typically if one didn’t know about interfaces, they would do the following.</p><p>We have the User struct as follows:</p><div><p><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
3
4
5
6
</pre></td><td><pre><span>type</span> <span>User</span> <span>struct</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>FirstName</span> <span>string</span>
    <span>LastName</span> <span>string</span>
    <span>DOB</span> <span>string</span>
    <span>// etc..</span>
<span>}</span>
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></p></div><p>and then our total program would look like this when we add our HTTP handler:</p><div><p><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1

In the example we’ve mentioned above, if we had used interfaces if we’re dealing with either of PostgreSQL or Mongo but not both, our codebase would seem very confusing.</p></li><li><p>Collaboration is essential between developers when using interfaces. If additional methods are added to existing interfaces, other code might break because your version hasn’t still implemented those functions.</p></li><li><p>For testing purposes. Interfaces are used in testing to mock/fake database connections and functionality by implemented required functions.</p></li><li><p>Passing interfaces to functions can be a ton of help. But it can bite you in the worst situations sometimes and can lead to runtime bugs. Golang is a statically typed language unlike JS and when interfaces are blindly passed without proper debugging, compile time errors aren’t likely to occur because all the benefits of “statically typed” aren’t in your court anymore.</p></li></ul><p>Checkout this <a href="https://sweetohm.net/article/go-interfaces.en.html">list of all Go interfaces</a> to know more about interfaces in the Go standard library.</p><h2 id="examples-of-practical-interfaces">Examples of practical interfaces</h2><ul><li>A word count utility as described here by <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/dyoo/">u/dyoo</a></li></ul><p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/2dsof3/ask_golang_when_and_where_to_use_interfaces/cjsyyj2">Card</a> </p><ul><li>This comment in the same thread gives a really good context about how interfaces are used.</li></ul><p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/2dsof3/ask_golang_when_and_where_to_use_interfaces/cjspiit">Card</a> </p><ul><li>A program to <code>send</code> a piece of information like OTP, to both a user’s mobile number and his email account.</li></ul><h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2><p>I hopefully transferred enough knowledge to you wonderful people about interfaces in Go.

            <p>The Program audio series is a fiction podcast I write, direct, edit, and produce. Fans have described it as “love child of Black Mirror and NPR”. It’s made on zero budget and has so far received over 130,000 downloads.</p>

            <p>
                <img alt="" src="https://programaudioseries.com/the-program-results-2/images/1.jpg">
            </p>

            <p>I described how The Program came to be and how it launched in <a href="https://programaudioseries.com/the-program-results/">my first blog post</a> back in April, so if you’re an aspiring podcaster make sure you check out the first instalment as well. We’re picking up where that article left off - and just like last time, mistakes made &amp; lessons learned are in <strong>bold</strong>.</p>

            <h3>US store feature</h3>

            <p>Hands down, the most important promotional vehicle for The Program so far has been Apple Podcasts. In the first 6 months since The Program’s release, they featured the show in 5 countries - Canada, Australia &amp; New Zealand, and the UK &amp; Ireland. Then in June I finally obtained the jewel in the crown - no, not India, but a spotlight in Apple Podcasts US. Noticing that The Program hadn’t been included in their newly established “Immersive Fiction” category, I notified Apple’s partner for Canada of the travesty. With tensions between the US and Canada already running high because of the steel tariffs, the matter was brought directly to Trudeau and Trump, and a compromise was soon reached: The Program will be listed as the number 1 show in “Immersive Fiction”, and Canada will concede their security council seat at the UN.</p>

            <p>
                <img alt="" src="https://programaudioseries.com/the-program-results-2/images/2.jpg">
            </p>

            <p>Having been featured for almost 6 months now, I’m quite confident that at least half of my daily downloads is attributable to the giant from Cupertino. Spotify however remains elusive, so if anybody reading this can lend a good word please <a href="mailto:ims@programaudioseries.com">contact me</a> and help avert another international crisis.</p>

            <h3>Change of hosting</h3>

            <p>Earlier this year, my hosting provider <a href="https://www.whooshkaa.com/">Wooshkaa</a> changed their strategy and decided to cater to established podcasting partners - which makes sense seeing that they provide power features such as IAB certification. However, for me this meant my hosting charges would go from zero to $100 per month, which just didn’t make sense seeing that The Program’s still a money-losing operation (turns out audio drama is not the most lucrative of fields - if this were a Medium post, it’d be the highlighted section).</p>

            <p>So I switched to <a href="https://redcircle.com/">RedCircle</a>, <strong>a podcast host that’s not only free, but also boasts cool extra features</strong> such as built-in capability to accept listener donations, cross-promotion with other shows, and dynamically inserted ads - a feature I haven’t taken advantage of yet, but which brings us to a topic that seems to be quite popular.</p>

            <h3>Monetization</h3>

            <p>More than one person has asked me why I haven’t mentioned the monetary aspect in my first article (two - it was two persons). The answer is simple: back then there was no monetary aspect to talk about. At the time, the only way to support the show was to chip in a few bucks at <a href="https://www.buymeacoffee.com/">buymeacoffee.com</a> - a service which seemed like an affable alternative to Patreon. However, as the builders of our civilization remarked, nomen est omen - while I was able to get a bit recurring revenue on buymeacoffee, most people treated it as a tip jar. Which is perfectly fine, since my motivation for making The Program was and is deeply intrinsic. I was becoming aware however, that in order for the show to grow I had to start generating at least some income from it - if only to compensate my collaborators who contribute their time and energy into the endeavour.</p>

            <p>So at the end of September I introduced <a href="https://programaudioseries.com/support/">five more ways to give to the show</a> with the promise of bonus material to supporters (one mini-episode and two alternative endings that were previously available to everybody). Here are the results:</p>

            <ul>
                <li><a href="https://liberapay.com/Program/">Liberapay</a>: crickets</li>
                <li>Bitcoin: 1 donation sent from a friend to test the wallet</li>
                <li><a href="https://www.paypal.com/paypalme/programaudioseries">Paypal</a>: 2 donations</li>
                <li>Interac: 3 donations</li>
                <li><a href="https://www.patreon.com/programaudioseries">Patreon</a>: 29 patrons pledging $125 per month</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Which goes to show that <strong>Patreon is king</strong>. Which stupefies me, because for the life of me I don’t see what’s so special about it - as far as I can tell, people don’t use Patreon to find new content, meaning the service itself is not bringing me subscribers. Sure, I guess it’s true Patreon was the first site that successfully attracted people with disposable income and persuaded them to financially support content creators. But to now take a 20% cut in perpetuity (which is how much payment, platform, and payout fees deduct) seems like pure rent-seeking to me. This, combined with the fact that all these platforms are accountable only to themselves, is why I’m strategically building a relationship with my patrons exclusively through email, which is how I dispense bonus content (until a Silicon Valley company inevitably figures out how to insert themselves between people’s emails in order to extract profit).</p>

            <p>One more way I tried to raise money for the show was by selling merch. I initially looked at <a href="http://teepublic.com/">Teepublic</a> for this, but ultimately opted for the <strong>combination of <a href="http://printful.com/">Printful</a> integrated with <a href="https://launchcart.com/">LaunchCart</a>, as it offered more customization and the ability to set my own profit margins</strong>. The result is The Program’s <a href="https://store.programaudioseries.com/">official store</a>, where I sold a whopping 4 items. However, I do feel like I’ve got myself to blame for that, as I don’t think I’ve done my best to create compelling products, and I plan to give it another go later on - but I’m definitely <strong>putting merch on hold until my audience grows much bigger</strong>.</p>

            <p>While I still haven’t inserted ads into the show (and at this point have no plans to), I was able to attract the show’s first sponsor: a lovely lad by the name of Boris and his company <a href="https://atlasauthority.com/">Atlas Authority</a> reached out and bought the show the recording equipment, allowing us to own the means of production and bringing the global class struggle one step closer to its end. Boris shrewdly realized that investing in the show now - while probably not making most sense from the strict numbers perspective - assures that his message will be heard in the years to come with exactly the kind of audience his Atlassian consulting company wants to attract. And if The Program crashes and burns, hey, at least they supported something that brings joy to people, versus giving money to Mark Zuckerberg. Speak of the devil...</p>

            <h3>Social media</h3>

            <p>Early on I made the decision not to promote The Program on any properties owned by Facebook, which probably hurts the show, but helps me live with myself. The two networks I am active on are Twitter and Reddit.</p>

            <p>The two couldn’t be more different. From my experience, Twitter is where the rich and the famous pontificate to the masses and no real communication takes place. Despite making original content for over a year now, I had little success either getting new listeners or building any sense of a community. I still post there but mostly because I enjoy making <a href="https://twitter.com/TheProgramAS/status/1274740157854466049">illustrated quotes</a> from the show and I don’t know where else to publish these. But my point stands that <strong>I do not recommend spending time on Twitter if your goal is to organically promote an audio drama</strong>.</p>

            <p>Being a part of <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/programaudioseries/">reddit</a> on the other hand has been nothing but pleasure. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ProgramAudioSeries/">The Program’s subreddit</a> facilitated some great discussions, allowed me to get valuable feedback, and most definitely promoted the show to new audiences. Especially valuable was the subreddit <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/audiodrama/">r/audiodrama</a>, adeptly moderated by Hitch42, which is shaping into <strong>a must place to promote any audio fiction</strong>. I also gained quite a number of downloads from a post I was allowed to publish in <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/blackmirror/">r/blackmirror</a> that compared the two shows (still waiting for someone to call Black Mirror “The Program you watch instead of listening to”).</p>

            <p>
                <img alt="" src="https://programaudioseries.com/the-program-results-2/images/3.jpg">
            </p>

            <p>I definitely shouldn’t forget to mention HackerNews crowd again, not only for being so kind to repeatedly upvote and promote The Program’s threads, but also for being a wonderful resource and a constant source of inspiration (incidentally, it also has an absolutely masterful moderator going under the moniker dang, offering further proof that mods are the secret ingredient to successful online communities).</p>

            <h3>Contributors</h3>

            <p>During the course of the year, my collaboration with <a href="http://christienledroit.ca/">Christien Ledroit</a>, a super talented musician (and incidentally a neighbour), grew ever more fruitful. Chris so far supplied music for five episodes, three of which he fully scored - in some cases actually facilitating the episode to transpire (for example, I wouldn’t have made <a href="https://programaudioseries.com/14-more-parrot-than-predator/">More parrot than predator</a> were it not for Chris who created the soundscape that comes alive in synch with the A.I. from the story). Chris is currently scoring three more episodes in various stages of production, so expect to hear many more of his fine works.</p>

            <p>The music that isn’t made specifically for the show mostly comes from <a href="https://www.neosounds.com/">Neosounds</a>, a royalty-free website I can <strong>absolutely recommend for the quality of their tunes and ease of use</strong>, and also because they have been generous enough to kindly extend the discount they provided to this poor producer (cost of music is the main reason the show is still not profitable even with the supporters and owning the equipment).</p>

            <p>On the visual side of things, the show’s artist <a href="https://en.cdacosta.art/">Carlos Costa</a> continues to amaze with his official illustrations, depicting three more episodes and creating new show art (which you can see at the top of the page).</p>

                    <p><a href="https://www.solarwinds.com/"><strong>S</strong>olarWinds</a>' credentials exposure from 2019 gives an important clue to how the breach at FireEye and US government possibly took place. It sheds light over a very important aspect that organizations often ignore – their insecure practices and inefficiency in securing credentials. <a href="https://savebreach.com/">SaveBreach</a> has identified weak credentials in hundreds of organizations over the course of years that we tested or, engaged in pentest with, and the <a href="https://www.solarwinds.com/">SolarWinds</a> breach seems to be just another case of gross carelessness and weak credentials. Although not confirmed by official sources, this is what we can conjecture for now. This reveals a very important piece of the puzzle, that is &nbsp;the attack was possibly not as sophisticated as it was reported to be.</p><p>In an <a href="https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2020/12/evasive-attacker-leverages-solarwinds-supply-chain-compromises-with-sunburst-backdoor.html">official blog post published yesterday</a>, FireEye said a "<em>highly evasive attacker </em>by <em>leveraging SolarWinds Supply Chain to Compromise Multiple Global Victims with SUNBURST Backdoor". </em>The original blog post from FireEye has been linked below</p><figure><a href="https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2020/12/evasive-attacker-leverages-solarwinds-supply-chain-compromises-with-sunburst-backdoor.html"><div><p>Highly Evasive Attacker Leverages SolarWinds Supply Chain to CompromiseMultiple Global Victims With SUNBURST Backdoor</p><p>We have discovered a global intrusion campaign, and we are tracking the actors behind this campaign as UNC2452.</p><p><img src="https://www.fireeye.com/content/dam/fireeye-www/brand/logos/fireeye.ico"><span>FireEye</span></p></div><p><img src="https://www.fireeye.com/content/dam/fireeye-www/fw/images/fireeye-2-color-square.png"></p></a><figcaption>FireEye article about the SolarWind breach</figcaption></figure><p><strong>H</strong>owever, a recent tweet from a <a href="https://twitter.com/vinodsparrow">cybersecurity researcher</a> hints at the fact this compromise probably dates back to 2019, that is more than an year before the <a href="https://www.solarwinds.com/">SolarWinds</a> and US government breach were reported, and the attacker might have been able to own their servers through very simple techniques. Password spraying is a very common technique employed by malicious attackers to compromise systems. In the case of SolarWinds this was even simpler, and weaker credentials may have made the hacker's job just more easier.</p><h2 id="solarwinds-exposed-their-ftp-credentials-in-a-public-github-repository">SolarWinds Exposed their FTP credentials in a public GitHub Repository</h2><p> <strong>Cybersecurity expert, </strong><a href="https://twitter.com/vinodsparrow/">Vinoth Kumar</a> hinted at the fact that the perpetrator may have breached SolarWinds and its clients quite easily – this affects the US government, and top organizations worldwide. Kumar made the following tweet today,</p><figure><blockquote data-width="550"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Was reading about a sophisticated attack on FireEye leveraging Solarwinds.

<figcaption>Vinoth Kumar's tweet regarding the exposed FTP credentials of SolarWinds</figcaption></figure><p>For the readers who couldn't fully understand the tweet, Vinoth had apparently gotten access to a SolarWinds FTP server on 19th November, 2019 through FTP credentials leaked in a SolarWinds public <a href="https://www.github.com/">GitHub</a> repo (apparently a<em> configuration</em> file as can be observed from the above email screenshot) which is more than one year ago. He responsibly reported this security incident to the SolarWinds PSIRT team.</p><p>The above tweet includes a screenshot of Vinoth's email communication with the SolarWinds' security team who seem to have acknowledged the issue, but its unclear whether after the incident SolarWinds hardened their server security.</p><h2 id="nation-state-adversary-or-a-simple-github-leak">Nation-State adversary or, a simple Github Leak?</h2><p>Exposing password in public GitHub repositories is a very common security lapse among organizations but can be prevented quite easily with secure practices. We have identified thousands of credentials belonging to companies and responsibly reported such cases. This happened in the case of SolarWinds too, Vinoth found their FTP server credentials which allowed read as well as write access to SolarWinds' FTP server. This critical vulnerability could have allowed them to upload malicious files and binaries to the SolarWinds Downloads FTP server, which made the SolarWinds Orion software available to its clients for download.</p><p>Vinoth confirmed that the FTP credentials SolarWinds leaked had write access by uploading a test file to the vulnerable FTP server – <a href="https://downloads.solarwinds.com/">downloads.solarwinds.com</a> which apparently hosts very important files, and if tampered with, the results can be disastrous, which was likely the reason of the US Government breach that happened recently. </p><h2 id="solarwinds-might-have-been-compromised-at-least-an-year-ago-in-november-2019">SolarWinds might have been compromised at least an year ago, in November 2019</h2><p>SolarWinds' PSIRT team's last reply to Vinoth was on 22nd November, 2019 which is 3 days after his report, </p><figure><blockquote data-width="550"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">This is the last response I got from them. <a href="https://t.co/Q24JGb3mvr">pic.twitter.com/Q24JGb3mvr</a></p>— Vinoth Kumar (@vinodsparrow) <a href="https://twitter.com/vinodsparrow/status/1338449660327854080?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 14, 2020</a></blockquote>

<figcaption>SolarWinds Security Team's response to Vinoth Kumar acknowledging the vulnerability</figcaption></figure><p>They have informed him that the Github repository exposing the credentials was subsequently taken down by SolarWinds. This may have played an important role in the latest security breach of SolarWinds that led to the US Government breach.</p><h2 id="complex-attack-or-a-case-of-weak-credentials">Complex Attack or, a Case of Weak Credentials?</h2><p>Vinoth further mentions in the tweet that the password was <code>*****123</code>. Our <strong>guess</strong> is that, the password of that FTP server was <code>solarwinds123</code>, leaving the redacted part, which is a very weak credential. <code>solarwinds123</code> is an example of the weakest credentials one can think of. &nbsp;Credentials of the FTP download server which was exposed on the SolarWinds GitHub repo are as follows – <code>solarwindsnet:solarwinds123</code></p><p>It would take seconds for advanced credential stuffing tools to exfiltrate into SolarWinds networks leading to the supply chain of the malware used in this attack, which seems to be the case here. Weak and easy to guess credentials continue to be a very common cause of breaches that happens these days. We have observed a lot of big companies using <code>admin:admin</code> and easy to guess credentials in their internal panels, while we performed pentests and bug hunting research. </p><p>This is an ideal example to learn from, what the consequence of weak credentials can be. Organizations should learn from these breaches how easy it is for attackers to compromise an entire organization just by guessing credentials and performing password stuffing attacks.</p><p><em>Although there is more to it that led to the series of events</em>, but the exposed and weak credentials might have played a major role in the SolarWinds hack. The attackers might have been able to gain persistence by obtaining SolarWinds internal credentials and then able to backdoor the SolarWinds Orion (which FireEye called the SUNBURST backdoor, https://downloads.solarwinds.com/solarwinds/CatalogResources/Core/2019.4/2019.4.5220.20574/SolarWinds-Core-v2019.4.5220-Hotfix5.msp) by uploading it to the SolarWinds Downloads FTP server, and distributing the same via SolarWinds website to its clients.</p><h2 id="qa-with-cybersecurity-expert-vinoth-kumar">Q&amp;A with Cybersecurity Expert <a href="https://vinothkumar.me/">Vinoth Kumar</a></h2><p>We asked cybersecurity expert Vinoth about his opinions on this breach, and how organizations can secure themselves from such sophisticated attacks.</p><p><strong>Q: As you mentioned you found some credentials in the open, do you think the attackers went for a similar approach to use simple OSINT techniques in order to exfiltrate the data?</strong></p><p><strong>Vinoth: </strong>I think the attackers must have used the same approach as the FTP server was open &amp; credentials were not strong enough. But it was a sophisticated attack as the binaries were signed.</p><p><strong>Q: How do you think organizations can protect themselves from breaches and exposing their credentials?</strong></p><p><strong>Vinoth: </strong>Normally most of the companies includes us use the automated scanner for GitHub repos scanning to see any leaked internal credential also security credential scanning should be part of SDLC process.</p><p>Vinoth's social handles and website – <a href="https://twitter.com/vinodsparrow">vinothsparrow</a> and <a href="https://vinothkumar.me/">VinothKumar.me</a></p><h2 id="notable-victims-of-the-solarwinds-breach">Notable Victims of the SolarWinds Breach</h2><p>US Treasury, the US NTIA, and possibly FireEye itself.

December 14, 2020 | https://www.osohq.com/post/graphql-authorization-graphene-sqlalchemy-oso | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.osohq.com/post/graphql-authorization-graphene-sqlalchemy-oso">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>GraphQL has been seeing a rapid uptick in adoption.  It enables a more expressive interface between frontend and backend code by allowing developers to specify exactly what data is required to render a given page.  While there are numerous wins for frontend engineers, the backend team needs a different mindset.  Instead of writing route handlers that return a fixed set of data (or maybe a few variations), the backend team must write <strong>resolver functions</strong> which return portions of the dataset individually. </p>
<p>We've seen that many developers will apply route-level checks as a starting point for authorization in their applications.  A common pattern is using decorators or other route level guards that ensure a user meets certain requirements (the user is an admin, the user has a certain role, etc.) before the route code is run.</p>
<p>This approach is easy to get started with, but is typically not feasible in GraphQL.  There is one route in a GraphQL application, and the potential set of data returned is highly variable.  There are many more combinations of fields in a GraphQL query than the number of routes in a typical REST application.</p>
<p>Since GraphQL is oriented around access to individual data elements, a natural place to enforce authorization is during data access.  GraphQL's official documentation acknowledges as much:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Where should you perform validation and authorization checks? The answer: inside a dedicated business logic layer. Your business logic layer should act as the single source of truth for enforcing <em>business domain rules</em> [emphasis added].</p>
</blockquote>
<p>– <a href="https://graphql.org/learn/thinking-in-graphs/#business-logic-layer">https://graphql.org/learn/thinking-in-graphs/#business-logic-layer</a></p>
<p>Great. Easy.  But how does that actually work?  How do we enforce a business domain rule? Is there a simple abstraction for specifying them?</p>
<p>In this post, we'll look at using oso—an open source authorization library—for enforcing authorization rules.  We'll see how to declaratively specify authorization rules in Polar, oso's policy language, and how to integrate oso into a GraphQL application in only a few lines of code.</p>
<p>We'll use SQLAlchemy as our ORM, and Graphene — a popular Python GraphQL library.  The <code>sqlalchemy-oso</code> <a href="https://docs.osohq.com/using/frameworks/sqlalchemy.html#installation">library</a> will provide the glue between oso, GraphQL and SQLAlchemy, allowing us to enforce authorization consistency.</p>

<p>We'll start with a basic Flask app representing an expense management application.  To follow along, <a href="https://github.com/osohq/oso-graphene-sqlalchemy-app">clone the project on GitHub</a>.  We'll walk through the parts of this app relevant to authorization, but the full code is available in the project. We'll assume some familiarity with Flask, SQLAlchemy and GraphQL.  Each section of this post is based on a commit in the repository, and we'll link to the relevant commit at the beginning of the section.</p>
<p>If you plan on following along and trying out the examples as you read, make sure to follow the <a href="https://github.com/osohq/oso-graphene-sqlalchemy-app/blob/main/README.md">README</a> to install the dependencies so you can run the code. This section covers the <a href="https://github.com/osohq/oso-graphene-sqlalchemy-app/tree/922af81fc265efc82f9572e174833689f051ae9a">initial commit</a>.</p>
<p>Our app has a few models:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Expense:</strong> An expense created by a user.</li>
<li><strong>User:</strong> A user accessing the application.</li>
</ul>
<p>We'll start with these, and add some more later.  Here are our initial models from <code>models.py</code>. These are regular SQLAlchemy models.  We used the <a href="https://flask-sqlalchemy.palletsprojects.com/en/2.x/">flask_sqlalchemy</a> library to integrate with Flask and make our setup a bit easier.</p>
<pre><code>from flask_sqlalchemy import SQLAlchemy

from sqlalchemy.orm import relationship

db = SQLAlchemy()

class Expense(db.Model):
    __tablename__ = 'expenses'

    id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True)
    amount = db.Column(db.Integer)

    created_by_id = db.Column(db.Integer, db.ForeignKey('users.id'))
    created_by = relationship("User")

    description = db.Column(db.Text)

class User(db.Model):
    __tablename__ = 'users'

    id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True)
    email = db.Column(db.String(256))
</code></pre>

<p>An Expense is created by a user, available at the <code>Expense.created_by</code> property.</p>
<p>We also have a GraphQL schema defined using Graphene over these models in <code>app/schema.py</code>:</p>
<pre><code>import graphene
from graphene import relay
from graphene_sqlalchemy import SQLAlchemyConnectionField, SQLAlchemyObjectType

from flask import g

from . import models

class Expense(SQLAlchemyObjectType):
    class Meta:
        model = models.Expense
        interfaces = (relay.Node,)

class User(SQLAlchemyObjectType):
    class Meta:
        model = models.User
        interfaces = (relay.Node,)

class Query(graphene.ObjectType):
    expenses = SQLAlchemyConnectionField(Expense.connection)
    user = graphene.Field(User)
    node = graphene.relay.Node.Field()

    def resolve_user(parent, info):
        return (g.current_user
                if isinstance(g.current_user, models.User)
                else None)

# ... snip ...

schema = graphene.Schema(query=Query)
</code></pre>

<p>This schema uses the <a href="https://docs.graphene-python.org/projects/sqlalchemy/en/latest/">Graphene-SQLAlchemy library</a> to create Graphene schema objects for our SQLAlchemy models.  This is a <a href="https://docs.graphene-python.org/projects/sqlalchemy/en/latest/tutorial/#defining-our-models">standard approach</a> for using SQLAlchemy with Graphene.</p>
<p>We can make a simple query (I'm using the awesome <a href="https://github.com/graphql/graphiql">GraphiQL</a> tool for this, but you can also just go to <a href="http://localhost:5000/graphql">http://localhost:5000/graphql</a> in your browser) and see that our app is working:</p>
<p><img alt="Final%20d38ce8f758064d59a83b0e0d6ff6aa74/Screen_Shot_2020-12-08_at_6.14.44_PM.png" src="https://images.osohq.com/graphql-authorization-graphene-sqlalchemy-oso/Final%20d38ce8f758064d59a83b0e0d6ff6aa74/Screen_Shot_2020-12-08_at_6.14.44_PM.png"></p>
<h2>Adding authorization</h2>
<p>At this point, we have a basic GraphQL app, without authorization.  Let's set that up. Here's the <a href="https://github.com/osohq/oso-graphene-sqlalchemy-app/commit/8bf8c4a411f83e640fdd3537ddcc3d59049edecf">commit on GitHub</a>.</p>
<p>Our initial authorization rule will be based on the concept of data owners: <em>users can view their own expenses.</em></p>
<p>To implement this rule, we would need to perform filtering at the SQLAlchemy level. Which means:</p>
<ol>
<li>Adding a custom resolver for Expense</li>
<li>Checking all other places the GraphQL schema might access expenses</li>
<li>Implementing the custom SQLAlchemy query</li>
<li>Repeating for every other model and authorization check.</li>
</ol>
<p>This authorization rule is based on each database record—sometimes referred to as object-level permissions.  It can be challenging to abstract as middleware, and is certainly more complex than just adding the simple decorator we discussed earlier. </p>
<p>Instead, we'll use the <code>sqlalchemy-oso</code> library.  We need to make two changes to set this up:</p>
<ol>
<li>Add an instance of <code>Oso</code> to our application.</li>
<li>Write a policy containing our authorization rules.</li>
</ol>
<p>To add oso, we'll modify the <code>create_app</code> function:</p>
<pre><code>from oso import Oso
from sqlalchemy_oso import register_models

def create_app():
    # snip ...

    # Create oso instance which will hold our policy.
    oso = Oso()  
    # Make SQLAlchemy models available in the policy.
    register_models(oso, db.Model)  
    # Load policy file into oso.
    oso.load_file(Path(__file__).parent / "policy.polar")   

    # ...
</code></pre>

<p>Then, we swap out the <code>SQLAlchemy</code> object in our app with <code>AuthorizedSQLAlchemy</code>. In <code>models.py</code>:</p>
<pre><code>from sqlalchemy_oso.flask import AuthorizedSQLAlchemy

db = AuthorizedSQLAlchemy(
    get_oso=lambda: current_app.oso,
    get_user=lambda: getattr(g, "current_user", None),
    get_action=lambda: "read"
)
</code></pre>

<p>We use this object instead of <code>flask_sqlalchemy.SQLAlchemy</code>.  It provides a <a href="https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/13/orm/session.html">SQLAlchemy Session object</a> that filters queries to only return objects that are authorized for the current user and action.</p>
<p>Our policy file, <code>app/policy.polar</code> is empty for now.</p>
<p>Now, let's check our query results:</p>
<p><img alt="Final%20d38ce8f758064d59a83b0e0d6ff6aa74/Screen_Shot_2020-12-09_at_6.42.46_PM.png" src="https://images.osohq.com/graphql-authorization-graphene-sqlalchemy-oso/Final%20d38ce8f758064d59a83b0e0d6ff6aa74/Screen_Shot_2020-12-09_at_6.42.46_PM.png"></p>
<p>Nothing's returned anymore.  Why? The policy file is empty.  Polar is deny by default, so we'll need to add some rules.  Before we do that, let's take a look at how this is working.  Our app has an endpoint that will log the SQL used to execute our last query.  If you're following along, run the app with:</p>
<pre><code>$ FLASK_RUN_EXTRA_FILES=app/policy.polar FLASK_DEBUG=1 flask run
</code></pre>

<p>Run a query in GraphiQL.  Below is a good starting point.</p>
<pre><code>{
  expenses {
    edges {
      node {
        id
        description
        createdBy {
          email
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Now visit, <a href="http://localhost:5000/sql">http://localhost:5000/sql</a>.</p>
<p>Here, we see:</p>
<pre><code>SELECT count(*) AS count_1
  FROM (
        SELECT expenses.id AS expenses_id,
               expenses.amount AS expenses_amount,
               expenses.created_by_id AS expenses_created_by_id,
               expenses.description AS expenses_description
          FROM expenses
         WHERE 0 = 1
         ORDER BY expenses.id ASC
       ) AS anon_1
</code></pre>

<p>Notice our WHERE clause: <code>0 = 1</code>.  Where's that coming from? <code>sqlalchemy-oso</code> enforces our Polar policy by translating rules from the policy into SQL filters.  <code>0 = 1</code> is always false, which causes no records to be returned from the database.</p>
<h2>Adding some rules</h2>
<p>Now that we have oso integrated, let's finish implementing our authorization rule.  Keep the app running, the <code>FLASK_RUN_EXTRA_FILES</code> environment variable we set will ensure that Flask reloads the app when you change the policy.</p>
<p>Let's try the following (in <code>app/policy.polar</code>):</p>
<pre><code>allow(_actor, _action, _resource);
</code></pre>

<p>This policy allows the user to access any object.  In Polar, each statement in the policy is called a rule.  The <code>allow</code> rule is a special rule that is used as the entrypoint to policies.  It has three arguments, the <strong>actor</strong> (who's making the request), the <strong>action</strong> (what the request will do), and the <strong>resource</strong> (what the request is operating over).  Our policy has one rule.  Each parameter starts with <code>_</code> which indicates an anonymous variable (one that matches anything because there are no constraints on it).</p>
<p>Rerun the query, and check out the SQL (Just refresh <a href="http://localhost:5000/sql">http://localhost:5000/sql</a>. You'll see a few statements there, I've picked out the primary SQL query used to resolve the GraphQL query):</p>
<pre><code>SELECT expenses.id AS expenses_id,
       expenses.amount AS expenses_amount,
       expenses.created_by_id AS expenses_created_by_id,
       expenses.description AS expenses_description
  FROM expenses
 WHERE 1 = 1
 ORDER BY expenses.id ASC
 LIMIT 4
OFFSET 0
</code></pre>

<p>Now, we see <code>WHERE 1 = 1</code>.  This is always true! As a result, everything's been returned.  </p>
<p>Let's go a little further:</p>
<pre><code>allow(_: User, "read", _: Expense);
</code></pre>

<p>This policy is saying all users can read all expenses. Again, the <code>_</code> denotes an anonymous or ignored variable, but the <code>: User</code> syntax is checking that the input data matches a specific type. In this case, the User and Expense models from our <a href="http://models.py/">models.py</a> file.</p>

<p>I was using Scrapy to crawl some websites and mirror their content into a new one and at the same time, generate beautiful and unique URLs based on the title, but the title can appear repeated! So I added part of the original URL in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base36">base36</a> as uniqueness guarantees.</p>
<p>In the <em>URL</em> I wanted the title without special symbols, only ASCII and at the end a unique and short inditifier, and part of the result of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-2">SHA-256</a> of the URL in <em>base36</em>.</p>

December 14, 2020 | https://goel.io/nothing-to-hide | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://goel.io/nothing-to-hide">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>Within privacy circles, Glenn Greenwald’s <a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/glenn_greenwald_why_privacy_matters">2014 TED talk</a> titled “Why privacy matters” is considered required reading. One quote jumps out to nearly everyone ― including the live audience ― has to do with how Greenwald responds to people who don’t worry about privacy because they have nothing to hide.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I always say the same thing to them. I get out a pen, I write down my email address. I say, “Here’s my email address. What I want you to do when you get home is email me the passwords to all of your email accounts…[snip]”</p>

  <p>Not a single person has taken me up on that offer.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>He continues to explain why that is:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>And there’s a reason for that, which is that we as human beings, even those of us who in words disclaim the importance of our own privacy, instinctively understand the profound importance of it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Ending that thinking with:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>People can very easily in words claim that they don’t value their privacy, but their actions negate the authenticity of that belief.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I used to agree and echo the same point, mostly in jest. Some version of “then hand me your passwords” is even a popular comeback <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/privacy/search?q=%22nothing%20to%20hide%22&amp;restrict_sr=1">on Reddit</a> to the the “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nothing_to_hide_argument">nothing to hide</a>” argument.</p>

<p>Over time, I’ve come to realize that the response does very little to actually understand where people are coming from, and to really explain to them <a href="https://whyprivacymatters.org/">why privacy matters</a>. Of course no one would hand me keys to their bank account just to prove a point. I won’t dissect the matter too much ― people much more qualified than me have been <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&amp;as_sdt=0%2C48&amp;q=nothing+to+hide+argument&amp;btnG=&amp;oq=%22nothing+to+hide%22">doing so for years</a>.</p>

<p>One understated aspect of the “nothing to hide” argument has to do with how humans think of themselves in crowds. Much like in a busy city, people tend to think they are invisible; they are one in many. Everyone feels a sense of anonymity in large crowds. Individuals are surrounded, but not watched. They are not “important”.</p>

<p>I believe the same concept intrinsically causes an average person to suspend the need for privacy in the digital realm. I have nothing to hide, because no one is watching <em>me</em>. I am not “important”.</p>

<p>Up until the 1980s spying was very labor intensive and hard to scale. You could only spy on one person at a time. With the advent of <del>big data</del> digital data processing, falling prices of surveillance equipment, as well as dirt-cheap storage and compute technologies, that is no longer true. Through economies of scale, it is cheaper to monitor and spy on a hundred thousand people than on hundred people.</p>

<p>With the choice of privacy, we have the freedom to choose to be who we want; we are allowed to create identities we choose. The promise of the Internet and technology was to expand that choice even more. Every day, I see that promise reneged.</p>

<p>Recently, many apps including TikTok and LinkedIn were <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2020/06/tiktok-and-53-other-ios-apps-still-snoop-your-sensitive-clipboard-data/">caught snooping</a> on clipboards on iPhones (data you cut or copy but may not have pasted anywhere else). Weirdly, they all claimed to have had the same bug. Even with all the might of the US government or the Soviet spying apparatus, accidentally spying on tens of millions of people’s thoughts was impossible until recently. Now, all it takes is an over-worked software engineer.</p>

<p>We all are creeped out when we see a car following us. I do not believe that at this time privacy advocates are doing a good job of explaining to normal people why digital surveillance is cause for concern. I believe their arguments are scattered, hard to parse, and still considered an artifact of the cypherpunk era. We can do a better job of talking about how knowledge, privacy, and power are interconnected, and how that balance of power has tipped largely against the general public.</p>

<p>We can do a better job of explaining why the promise of a better life through technology has been a lie, and that the cost is too high.</p>

<p>Now, I don’t think we need to be extremists about our privacy. Giving up some privacy is good under some circumstances ― sharing personal details with loved ones creates a more intimate bond, sharing some details with government health departments helps in contact tracing during a pandemic.</p>

It is necessary to effectively describe how the objects are positioned in the description space. For example, the typical untagged data learning tasks such as clustering, dimensionality reduction, anomaly detection, density estimation, etc.</p></li></ul><p>Let’s skip the description of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinforcement_learning" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u><b>Reinforcement Learning</b></u></a>, which is the basic type of training, and go straight to the description of <b>Self-Supervised Learning</b> that has become popular in recent years. There is a huge unlabeled sample here, it is necessary to form a pseudo label for each object and solve the resulting SL-problem, yet we are not so much interested in the quality of the solution to the problem we invented (so-called pretext task), but in the representation of objects, which will be learned in the course of solving it. This representation can be used in the future when solving SL tasks, also known as downstream tasks.&nbsp;</p><p>One of the main reasons for self-supervised machine learning is a small amount of labeled data (in this case, there is a temptation to use unlabeled data, possibly from a different domain). Unlike training with partially labeled data, self-supervised learning uses completely arbitrary unlabeled data that is not related to the problem being solved.</p><p>Let's look at some self-supervised learning examples, and then get back to its definition. Around 80% of modern word processing (NLP) consists of self-supervised learning. With the help of self-supervised learning, almost all representations of words and texts are obtained. For instance, in the classical word2vec algorithm, you take an unlabeled text corpus followed by coming up with a problem with labels (an example would be taking neighboring words to predict the central word or, conversely, taking the central word to predict those adjacent to it). Then, a simple neural network is trained on this problem, getting representations of words (and weights of the trained network), which are already used in other tasks, unrelated to the pretext task. This approach is often called <b>transfer learning</b>. Generally speaking, transfer learning is a broad concept and refers to using a model that’s been trained to solve problem ”a” to solve problem “b”. In self-supervised learning, it is important that the markup in pseudo-marks is obtained automatically. For example, representations obtained by the <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1708.00107.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Cove</u></a> method, which uses an encoder for a machine translation task, would be transferred, not self-supervised.&nbsp;</p><p>Let's get back to the definition of self-supervised learning and go over some terms:</p><p><b>A pretext task </b>is a task with artificially created labels (pseudo-labels), on which the model is trained to learn good representations of objects. For example, there is hope that in the neural network the initial and middle layers will be first trained on the pretext task, frozen later on in order to then train the last layers.</p><p><b>Pseudo-labels</b> are labels that are obtained automatically, without any manual labeling, and teaching of such contributes to the formation of good representations.</p><p><b>Downstream task </b>is a task that evaluates the quality of features learned by self-supervised learning. In almost all experiments in self-supervised learning articles, simple models are trained on the received feature representations in downstream tasks: logistic regression or the nearest neighbor method. <b>Thus, self-supervised learning is a direction in deep learning that seeks to make deep learning a data preprocessing procedure. </b>As such, networks are needed to form features, are trained on cheap markup of large sets of initially unlabeled data, and the problem itself is solved by a simple model.</p><p>Let's talk about the history of the development of self-supervised learning and use image processing as examples. At the first stage of development of this area, experiments were carried out mainly with the formulation of downstream tasks. The main goal here was to figure out how to automatically add labels so that self-supervised models get good representations. For example, in convolutional neural networks for image processing, the first and middle layers were trained, which are known to be responsible for detecting edges, corners, and some kind of abstract forms.</p><p><b>1. Predicting (spatial) context</b></p><p>Let’s take a look at the following example. A random patch is selected - in this case, it is a rectangular area of ​​the image with eight adjacent patches (see fig. 2) and one of them is selected. Naturally, by looking at paired patches ("central patch", "neighboring"), a person can easily determine how the adjacent one is located relative to the central one. If a neural network learns to detect this, then it understands how the objects of the real world are arranged (the wheels of the truck are lower than the cab, and the hat of a person is higher than the face, etc.). It seems intuitive that when the network learns this task, then its lower layers must learn to perfectly detect edges, corners, etc.</p><figure><img data-src="//images.ctfassets.net/pzhspng2mvip/25EwgCD8jjShj8OdeBBqIR/5f372ff25e4dde30cc9ab7b41d9c8cd7/fig_2.png" alt="fig 2" src="https://images.ctfassets.net/pzhspng2mvip/25EwgCD8jjShj8OdeBBqIR/5f372ff25e4dde30cc9ab7b41d9c8cd7/fig_2.png"><figcaption>fig 2</figcaption></figure><p><i>fig. 2, publication [2] [2] Doersch, A. Gupta, and A. A. Efros. &nbsp; </i><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1505.05192.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u><i>Unsupervised visual representation learning by context prediction</i></u></a><i>.&nbsp; In International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), 2015</i></p><p>There are several "hacks" in the implementation of the method which will be described here since they are often used in self-supervised learning. In fig. 2 it can be seen that the patches are located with a gap and random displacement. This is done to complicate the task, because a person can assemble a puzzle from pieces without thinking about the meaning of what is depicted (by looking at how the puzzle joints are coordinated), but we would want the neural network to "understand" that is shown, not to find similar joints. Another trick is that in such methods you can “spoil the colors”; in this example, for instance, two random channels were clogged with noise. This is due to the laws of optics (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromatic_aberration" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>chromatic aberration</u></a>): all modern images were taken using photo/video equipment and they have a shift in the difference in the average for RGB channels when moving from the center to the edges (for example, you can train a network that will quite accurately determine which part of the image the patch is cut from). To prevent the network from using this feature when solving a pretext task, the channels are spoiled.</p><p><b>2. Predicting image rotation</b></p><p>Another task that can be easily solved by a person, and the labels which are obtained automatically, is the task to determine the angle by which the image was rotated (fig. 3). The image is taken and rotated at a random angle and this angle is declared as a label of the resulting image. Experiments have shown that it is better to rotate by an angle multiple of 90 degrees and, thus, to solve a problem with 4 classes. It is notable that the network in the pretext task pays attention to where the head of the depicted person or animal is, or to where the eyes/mouth is, or whether the head is depicted too large. In essence, having come up with an artificial problem, we taught the network to detect the head without planning on doing so! Note that this technique does not work with all data (sometimes images do not have an objective correct orientation).</p><figure><img data-src="//images.ctfassets.net/pzhspng2mvip/2kms9vsdbDxPEmq2IPCxYu/bca3392988eb4748d7693de569d282a2/fig_3.png" alt="fig 3" src="https://images.ctfassets.net/pzhspng2mvip/2kms9vsdbDxPEmq2IPCxYu/bca3392988eb4748d7693de569d282a2/fig_3.png"><figcaption>fig 3</figcaption></figure><p><i>pic 3.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I still remember the days in 2018 when my marketplace <a href="https://mentorcruise.com/">MentorCruise</a> turned from a dying star into a busy and lively place. Just a few weeks before I had added a few auto-generated pages that should help people find suitable mentors faster.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://mentorcruise.com/filter/marketing/"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1dda19ae-f9c0-46ac-838b-3e116ff2bb78_2942x1416.png" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/1dda19ae-f9c0-46ac-838b-3e116ff2bb78_2942x1416.png&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:701,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:266837,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:&quot;https://mentorcruise.com/filter/marketing/&quot;}" alt=""></a></figure></div><p>It was really no witchcraft and I didn’t even plan on it becoming a major user magnet. I just had a look at the top 10 most popular tags, plugged them into my database and generated a few landing pages in the style of <em>find XY mentor.</em> Some custom copy here and there and the filtered list of mentors and done!</p><p>What I didn’t expect is that these landing pages started to rank <strong>highly</strong> on Google. Even better, these new 100s of visitors had a 10% conversion rate at the time. That meant if 100 people found my site through one of those search terms, 10 would reach out to a mentor. For me, still anxiously watching new contact requests coming in, it felt like an explosion!</p><p>Today, organic traffic through search machines makes up a little more than half of the traffic on MentorCruise and yet, over 80% of paid customers are saying to have found us through Google.</p><p>So, here’s what’s powerful about this. Other than many SaaS businesses, a marketplace is a living thing. You are going to have new suppliers joining all the time with great interest in publishing a complete profile with a lot of content on it. An amazing opportunity to generate listicles!</p><p>Additionally, as people interact with each other and even purchase something, you are building an automatic way of collecting testimonials. Great to write stories about!</p><p>Then, once your marketplace becomes a little bit more competitive, you will have people reach out to gain more exposure. It’s a great opportunity to get more guest posts – high-quality long-form articles – for free!</p><p>This all takes quite a bit creativity and I won’t be able to offer you a solution for what’s going to work for you.</p><p>In terms of landing pages, these are working amazing:</p><ul><li><p>Have your suppliers add tags and generate listicles based on that, e.g. <em>find a javascript coach</em></p></li><li><p>If proximity plays any role, generate country- and region-based landing pages – <em>Ford Mustangs in Colorado </em>or <em>get a tutor in Germany</em></p></li><li><p>Leaderboards allow you to write catchy titles based on information only you have – <em>best apartments under $800 per month</em> could just be one of your filtered landing pages, for example</p></li><li><p>Long-tail keywords get less clicks but higher conversion, e.g. <em>best furnished two-bedroom apartments near Paris under €800 per month</em></p></li></ul><p>In short: Identify your data sources, generate content from them, rank on Google for more keywords and profit.</p><p>There’s more to SEO for marketplaces of course. Your hundreds of landing pages don’t have much value if you don’t have a strong domain reputation, for example. But I hope that this can be an inspiration for you, just as much as it was a surprise for me in 2018.</p></div></div>]]>

<p>As we approach Christmas 2020, many Americans are being forced to decide how they will celebrate the holiday. The <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" title="CDC Website" href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/daily-life-coping/holidays/winter.html">CDC</a> has recommended postponing travel and staying home. It has also recommended using technology to host virtual gatherings.</p>
<p>But how likely are Americans to follow these guidelines and leverage technology to adapt to the pandemic? To find out, we surveyed 1,002 Americans. Below, we analyze the results of our two surveys, which were taken two weeks apart on November 23rd and December 7th.</p>

</ul>

<h2>Almost 30% of Americans Will Celebrate Christmas Virtually in 2020</h2>
<p>We surveyed Americans in November and December to find out how many will use software to celebrate Christmas virtually, and how many are moving forward with Christmas per usual. We found that 19.3% of Americans will celebrate Christmas all in person per usual, 43.0% will celebrate in-person, but with a smaller group, and 28.5% will celebrate virtually.</p>
<div>
<p><img alt="how Americans will celebrate Christmas 2020" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/softwarepundit/image/upload/c_limit,dpr_1.0,f_auto,h_1600,q_auto,w_1600/v1/software/main-christmas-2020-chart" srcset="https://res.cloudinary.com/softwarepundit/image/upload/c_limit,dpr_1.0,f_auto,h_1600,q_auto,w_1600/v1/software/main-christmas-2020-chart 1x, https://res.cloudinary.com/softwarepundit/image/upload/c_limit,dpr_2.0,f_auto,h_1600,q_auto,w_1600/v1/software/main-christmas-2020-chart 2x">
</p>
</div>
<p>In recent weeks, COVID-19 cases have spiked across the country. We compared our November and December surveys to understand how the increase in cases has impacted Christmas plans. Interestingly, the percentage of respondents who indicated that they would celebrate in-person per usual, and the percentage who indicated that they would celebrate virtually both increased. In contrast, the percentage who responded that they would celebrate in-person with a smaller group declined.</p>

</p>
</div>
<h2>Americans in Blue States are 33% More Likely to Go Virtual, Red States 16% More Likely to Celebrate In Person</h2>
<p>We grouped respondent results by state to explore if a state's political orientation has an impact on Christmas plans. Respondents in states that were won by Joe Biden in the 2020 election were 33% more likely to celebrate Thanksgiving virtually (p=&lt;.01)). In addition, Americans in states that were won by Donald Trump were 16% more likely to celebrate in person (p=&lt;.01).</p>

</p>
</div>
<h2>Older Americans Are Less Likely to Celebrate in Person</h2>
<p>Breaking results down by age shows that the youngest Americans are most likely to celebrate Christmas in person. 73% of respondents aged 18-24 plan to celebrate Christmas in person. This contrasts with only 59% of Americans over the age of 65 who plan to celebrate in person. Only 15% of Americans over 65 plan to celebrate in person per usual, which is the lowest percentage among any age group.</p>

</p>
</div>
<h2>Females Are Far Less Likely to Celebrate Christmas In Person Per Usual</h2>
<p>Analyzing our data by gender also revealed differences in Christmas plans. Females were 88% less likely to celebrate Christmas in person per usual (p=&lt;.001). In contrast, women were more likely to indicate that they plan to celebrate in person with a smaller group. There was no statistically significant difference between the percentage of men and women who plan to celebrate in person in any size group (i.e. per usual or with a smaller group).</p>

<h2>Americans Have Become More Likely to Celebrate Holidays Virtually as COVID-19 Hospitalizations Have Increased</h2>
<p>In the past three months, we have asked Americans about their holiday celebration four times –&nbsp;twice for Christmas, and twice for <a target="blank" title="Almost 20% of Americans Will Hold Virtual Thanksgiving in 2020" href="https://www.softwarepundit.com/industry-research/virtual-thanksgiving">Thanksgiving</a>. As shown below, the percentage of Americans who indicated that they will celebrate holidays virtually has climbed as COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations have increased.</p>

<h2>What Are the Most Popular Software Solutions for Virtual Christmas?</h2>
<p>Our research revealed the four most popular software tools for virtual Christmas to be Zoom, Facebook Messenger Rooms, Google Meet and Skype. Consumers trust that these popular and proven <a title="video conferencing tools" href="https://www.softwarepundit.com/mental-health/hipaa-compliant-video-conferencing">video conferencing tools</a> can be used reliably for larger groups during holidays. They are also more familiar with them compared to newer or niche video chat software.</p>
<h3>Zoom</h3>
<p><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" title="Zoom Website" href="https://zoom.us/">Zoom</a> went public in late 2019, and became a household name as a result of COVID-19. It is among the most popular video conferencing software in the market today. Zoom does offer a free plan, but group meetings can only last for 40 minutes. Zoom subscriptions start at $149.90 per year.</p>
<h3>Facebook Messenger Rooms</h3>
<p>Facebook launched <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" title="Facebook Messenger Website" href="https://www.messenger.com/rooms">Messenger Rooms</a> in April 2020. With this new feature, you can use Facebook or Messenger to create a room of up to 50 people. Other than being free, a major upside of Messenger Rooms is that there's no time limit on video calls, and you don't need a Facebook account to join.</p>
<h3>Google Meet</h3>
<p>Google offers its own free video conferencing solution, known as <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" title="Google Meet Website" href="https://meet.google.com/">Google Meet</a>. Anyone with a Gmail account can create meetings, and invite up to 100 people to meet for up to 60 minutes for free. For $8 per month, you can increase these figures to 150 people and 300 hours.</p>
<h3>Skype</h3>
<p><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" title="Skype Website" href="https://www.skype.com/en/">Skype</a> is a popular video conferencing service that has been around since 2003. The Microsoft-owned company is still highly popular. It offers an attractive free plan that allows calls of up to 50 participants for up to 24 hours. Skype now works through any device with the Skype app or in any Internet-connected browser.</p>
<h2>Research Methodology</h2>
<p>To collect data, we conducted online surveys targeting a sample of all Americans physically located in the United States. 1,002 respondents were asked the multiple choice question "How will your family gather for Christmas this year?" Available answers were "All in person per usual", "In-person with a smaller group", "Virtually using a video call", and "Other." Answers were presented in a randomized order.</p>
<p>Detailed respondent data: </p><div>

A strong sense of ownership means that the individual deeply cares about and feels responsible for doing a good job for their customers, their team or their company. Owners don't assume someone else is there to catch the ball, they go for it. That is their default behavior. </p><p>Ownership clearly applies to almost every aspect of our lives, but here I'm mainly talking about it from an engineering manager's point of view. Managers are accountable for the reliability of systems that their teams own. A Manager cannot instill a great sense of ownership into their team members without feeling responsible and being accountable for the end-to-end experience of their customers.</p><p>Usually it is not difficult to figure out whether an individual, a team, or an organization has a strong sense of ownership: </p><ul><li>Does the individual, team or organization follow up on their commitments? Is communicating how they did with their commitments a part of their sprint or quarterly planning? </li><li>Does the individual, team or organization care about bugs, system outages or other issues that cause production unreliability? It is important to clarify that this does not mean there are no bugs, or issues that cause system unreliability. It means that the team is resolving these issues quickly, or making big investments in reliability that may take a long time to roll out. Does the team understand the problems causing unreliability and have both a short and long term plan to mitigate these problems?</li><li>Your customers usually don't know the underlying technology, or the services and components created by different teams in your company, and they don't care. Does the individual, team or organization take full ownership of the end-to-end customer experience or do they assume another person or team is responsible for this?</li></ul><figure><img src="https://blog.managers.app/content/images/2020/12/image-13.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.managers.app/content/images/size/w600/2020/12/image-13.png 600w, https://blog.managers.app/content/images/size/w1000/2020/12/image-13.png 1000w, https://blog.managers.app/content/images/size/w1600/2020/12/image-13.png 1600w, https://blog.managers.app/content/images/2020/12/image-13.png 1724w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>ownership requires making tough choices</figcaption></figure><h3 id="ownership-requires-making-tough-choices">Ownership Requires Making Tough Choices</h3><p>One thing to keep in mind about taking ownership is that it also requires you to make tough choices. These tough choices might not be received well by some colleagues and some customers. They might entail throwing away a functionality that one of your team members worked hard on. </p><p>Adding a new feature is usually much easier than taking it away from your customers. Giving new data is almost always much simpler than taking away data. Ownership means thinking hard and understanding your whys when adding new features but sometimes it also means making the decision to remove a service when you know you should not have implemented it in the first place. </p><h3 id="an-accountable-manager">An Accountable Manager</h3><p>A team with a great sense of ownership requires an accountable manager. An accountable manager must instill this sense of ownership into his/her team members because they cannot sustain it long term on their own.

                <h2 id="dsla-x-elrond">DSLA x Elrond</h2>

<p>Dear community, <a href="https://stacktical.com/">Stacktical</a>, the core development team of the DSLA Protocol, is proud to announce that we have partnered with the <a href="https://elrond.com/">Elrond</a> network to launch DSLA Maxima “Elrond Edition”, a maximalist port of DSLA Protocol on the Elrond blockchain.</p>

<p>The first DSLA product helps validators and delegators on Proof of Stake networks reduce their mutual exposure to staking infrastructure risks, using decentralized service level agreements and two-way, self-settled compensation claims.</p>

<p>Our immediate collaboration will focus on adding Elrond Network validators information in the DSLA Ethereum-based smart contracts. Soon after, DSLA Protocol will be deployed as smart contracts on the Elrond Network, serving the same purpose but at higher speeds and lower costs, hence the “Maxima” codename.</p>

<p>In the long term, the DSLA core development team will leverage Elrond’s high throughput and inexpensive smart contracts execution platform to deploy a decentralized SLA framework suitable for digital services of any kind.</p>

<p>“Elrond has one of the largest validator networks in the PoS space and is a great addition to DSLA Protocol, and our flagship two-way hedge against staking and delegation risks. But the biggest value for us long term is its high throughput and inexpensive smart contracts execution capabilities, which we can leverage to settle SLAs in real-time, at internet-scale, for a wide variety of industries.” said Wilhem Pujar, Stacktical CEO.</p>

<p>The collaboration will bring additional adoption for the Elrond smart contract platform and provide an immediately useful tool for Staking Providers looking to increase the quality of their services.</p>

<p>“Today’s unexpected Google outage will likely cause tens of millions of dollars in losses to businesses worldwide. Automatically settling SLA breaches will increase the quality of online services and help avoid such situations. We’re happy to support this through our collaboration with Stacktical” said Beniamin Mincu, Elrond CEO.</p>

<h2 id="about-elrond">About Elrond</h2>

<p>Elrond is the internet-scale blockchain, designed from scratch to bring a 1000-fold cumulative improvement in throughput and execution speed. To achieve this, Elrond introduces two key innovations: a novel Adaptive State Sharding mechanism, and a Secure Proof of Stake (PoS) algorithm, enabling linear scalability with a fast, efficient, and secure consensus mechanism. Thus, Elrond can process upwards of 15,000 transactions per second (TPS), with 6-second latency, and negligible cost, attempting to become the backbone of a permissionless, borderless, globally accessible internet economy.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Table of contents for this series of posts: “<a href="http://2ality.com/2017/11/about-reasonml.html">What is ReasonML?</a>”</p>
<hr>
<p>In this blog post, we look at <em>polymorphic variants</em>, which are a more flexible version of <a href="http://2ality.com/2017/12/variants-reasonml.html">normal variants</a>. But that flexibility also makes them more complicated.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>[Aside: this blog post was challenging to write and is based various resources on the web. Corrections and tips welcome!]</p>
<h2 id="what-are-polymorphic-variants%3F">What are polymorphic variants?&nbsp;&nbsp;</h2>
<p>Polymorphic variants are similar to normal variants. The biggest difference is that constructors are not tied to types anymore; they exist independently. That makes polymorphic variants more versatile and leads to interesting consequences for the type system. Some of those consequences are negatives – they are the price you pay for the versatility.</p>
<p>Let’s start with the following normal variant and then turn it into a polymorphic variant.</p>
<pre><code><span>type</span> rgb = Red <span>| <span>Green</span> | <span>Blue</span>;
</span></code></pre>
<p>The polymorphic version of <code>rgb</code> is defined like this:</p>
<pre><code><span>type</span> rgb = <span>[`R<span>ed</span> | `G<span>reen</span> | `B<span>lue</span>]</span>;
</code></pre>
<p>The constructors of a polymorphic variant must be wrapped in square brackets and their names must start with backticks followed by either lowercase letters or uppercase letters:</p>
<pre><code># `red;
- : [&gt; `red ] = `red
# `Red;
- : [&gt; `Red ] = `Red
</code></pre>
<p>As usual, types such as <code>rgb</code> must start with lowercase letters.</p>
<h3 id="polymorphic-constructors-exist-on-their-own">Polymorphic constructors exist on their own&nbsp;&nbsp;</h3>
<p>You can only use a non-polymorphic constructor if it is part of a non-polymorphic variant:</p>
<pre><code># Int(123);
Error: Unbound constructor Int

# type data = Int(int) | Str(string);
type data = Int(int) | Str(string);
# Int(123);
- : data = Int(123)
</code></pre>
<p>In contrast, you can just use polymorphic constructors. There is no need to define them beforehand:</p>
<pre><code># `Int(123);
- : [&gt; `Int(int) ] = `Int(123)
</code></pre>
<p>Note that <code>`Int(123)</code> has an interesting type: <code>[&gt; `Int(int) ]</code>. We’ll examine what that means later.</p>
<p>Polymorphic constructors existing on their own, enables using the same constructor more than once:</p>
<pre><code><span>type</span> color = <span>[`R<span>ed</span> | `O<span>range</span> | `Y<span>ellow</span> | `G<span>reen</span> | `B<span>lue</span> | `P<span>urple</span>]</span>;
<span>type</span> rgb = <span>[`R<span>ed</span> | `G<span>reen</span> | `B<span>lue</span>]</span>;
</code></pre>
<p>In contrast, with normal variants, you should avoid multiple variants within the same scope having the same constructor.</p>
<p>You can even use the same polymorphic constructor with different arities and/or type parameters:</p>
<pre><code># `Int("abc", true);
- : [&gt; `Int((string, bool)) ] = `Int(("abc", true))
# `Int(1.0, 2.0, 3.0);
- : [&gt; `Int((float, float, float)) ] = `Int((1., 2., 3.))
</code></pre>
<h3 id="extending-polymorphic-variants">Extending polymorphic variants&nbsp;&nbsp;</h3>
<p>When defining a polymorphic variant, you can extend an existing variant. In the following example, <code>color</code> extends <code>rgb</code>:</p>
<pre><code><span>type</span> rgb = <span>[`R<span>ed</span> | `G<span>reen</span> | `B<span>lue</span>]</span>;
<span>type</span> color = <span>[<span>rgb</span> | `O<span>range</span> | `Y<span>ellow</span> | `P<span>urple</span>]</span>;
</code></pre>
<p>As you can see, case matters here: <code>rgb</code> being lowercased indicates that its constructors are inserted.</p>
<p>Extending multiple variants is also possible:</p>
<pre><code><span>type</span> red = <span>[ `R<span>ed</span> ]</span>;
<span>type</span> green = <span>[ `G<span>reen</span> ]</span>;
<span>type</span> blue = <span>[ `B<span>lue</span> ]</span>;
<span>type</span> rgb = <span>[ <span>red</span> | <span>green</span> | <span>blue</span> ]</span>;
</code></pre>
<h3 id="the-namespace-of-polymorphic-constructors-is-global">The namespace of polymorphic constructors is global&nbsp;&nbsp;</h3>
<p>The names of non-polymorphic constructors are part of their scopes (e.g. their modules), whereas the namespace of polymorphic constructors is global. You can see that in the following example:</p>
<pre><code><span>module</span> M = {
  <span>type</span> data = <span>[`I<span>nt</span>(<span>int</span>) | `S<span>tr</span>(<span>string</span>)]</span>;
  <span>let</span> stringOfData =<span> (<span>x</span>: <span>data</span>) =&gt;</span>
    switch x {
    <span>| <span>`Int(<span>i</span>)</span> =&gt;</span> <span>string</span><span>_of_int(<span>i</span>)</span>
    <span>| <span>`Str(<span>s</span>)</span> =&gt;</span> s
    };
};
<span><span><span>M</span>.</span></span><span>string</span><span>OfData(`Int(123)</span>);
</code></pre>
<p>In the last line, the parameter of <code>M.stringOfData()</code> is created via a constructor that is not from <code>M</code>’s scope. Due to the global namespace of polymorphic constructors, the parameter is compatible with the type <code>data</code>.</p>
<h3 id="type-compatibility">Type compatibility&nbsp;&nbsp;</h3>
<p>How does ReasonML determine if the type of an actual parameter (function call) is compatible with the type of the formal parameter (function definition)? Let’s look at examples. We start by creating a type and a function whose single parameter is of that type.</p>
<pre><code># type rgb = [`Red | `Green | `Blue];
type rgb = [ `Blue | `Green | `Red ];
# let id = (x: rgb) =&gt; x;
let id: (rgb) =&gt; rgb = &lt;fun&gt;;
</code></pre>
<p>Next, we create a new type <code>rgb2</code> that has the same polymorphic constructors as <code>rgb</code> and call <code>id()</code> with a value whose type is <code>rgb2</code>:</p>
<pre><code># type rgb2 = [`Red | `Green | `Blue];
type rgb2 = [ `Blue | `Green | `Red ];
# let arg: rgb2 = `Blue;
let arg: rgb2 = `Blue;
# id(arg);
- : rgb = `Blue
</code></pre>
<p>Normally, the type of the formal parameter <code>x</code> and the actual parameter <code>arg</code> have to be the same. But with polymorphic variants, it’s enough if your types have the same constructors.</p>
<p>If, however, the type of an actual parameter <code>arg2</code> has less constructors, then ReasonML won’t let you do the function call:</p>
<pre><code># type rg = [`Red | `Green];
type rg = [ `Green | `Red ];
# let arg2: rg = `Red;
let arg2: rg = `Red;
# id(arg2);
Error: This expression has type rg but an expression was expected of type rgb
The first variant type does not allow tag(s) `Blue
</code></pre>
<p>The reason is that <code>id</code> makes precise demands on what it needs: <em>exactly</em> the constructors <code>`Red</code>, <code>`Green</code> and <code>`Blue</code>. Therefore, the type <code>rg</code> is not enough.</p>
<h4 id="from-concrete-types-to-type-constraints">From concrete types to type constraints&nbsp;&nbsp;</h4>
<p>Interestingly, the following does work:</p>
<pre><code># type rgb = [`Red | `Green | `Blue];
type rgb = [ `Blue | `Green | `Red ];
# let id = (x: rgb) =&gt; x;
let id: (rgb) =&gt; rgb = &lt;fun&gt;;

# let arg3 = `Red;
let arg3: [&gt; `Red ] = `Red;
# id(arg3);
- : rgb = `Red
</code></pre>
<p>Why? Because ReasonML didn’t infer a fixed type for <code>arg3</code>, it inferred the <em>type constraint</em> <code>[&gt; `Red ]</code>. This constraint is a so-called <em>lower bound</em> and means: “all types that have at least the constructor <code>`Red</code>”. This constraint is compatible with <code>rgb</code>, the type of <code>x</code>.</p>
<h4 id="type-constraints-for-parameters">Type constraints for parameters&nbsp;&nbsp;</h4>
<p>We can also use constraints as the types of parameters. For example, the following call to <code>id()</code> fails, because the parameter’s type, <code>rgbw</code>, has too many constructors:</p>
<pre><code># type rgbw = [`Red | `Green | `Blue | `White ];
type rgbw = [ `Blue | `Green | `Red | `White ];
# id(`Red: rgbw);
Error: This expression has type rgbw but an expression was expected of type rgb
The second variant type does not allow tag(s) `White
</code></pre>
<p>This time, we call <code>id()</code> and specify the type <code>rgbw</code> of the parameter directly (no intermediate <code>let</code> binding). We can make the function call work without changing the function call, by only changing <code>id()</code>:</p>
<pre><code># let id = (x: [&gt; `Red | `Green | `Blue]) =&gt; x;
let id: (([&gt; `Blue | `Green | `Red ] as 'a)) =&gt; 'a = &lt;fun&gt;;
# id(`Red: rgbw); /* same as before */
- : rgbw = `Red
</code></pre>
<p>Now <code>x</code> has a lower bound and accepts all types that have at least the given three constructors.</p>
<p>You can also define constraints by referring to variants. For example, the following definition of <code>id()</code> is basically equivalent to the previous one.</p>
<pre><code><span>let</span> id =<span> (<span>x</span>: [&gt; <span>rgb</span>]) =&gt;</span> x;
</code></pre>
<p>We’ll take a deeper look at type constraints later on.</p>
<h2 id="writing-extensible-code-with-polymorphic-variants">Writing extensible code with polymorphic variants&nbsp;&nbsp;</h2>
<p>One key benefit of polymorphic variants is that code becomes more extensible.</p>
<h3 id="the-type-and-code-we-want-to-extend">The type and code we want to extend&nbsp;&nbsp;</h3>
<p>As an example, take the following type definitions for shapes. They are polymorphic versions of the example in <a href="http://2ality.com/2017/12/variants-reasonml.html">the preceding blog post</a>.</p>
<pre><code><span>type</span> point = <span>[ `P<span>oint</span>(<span>float</span>, <span>float</span>) ]</span>;
<span>type</span> shape = <span>[
  | `R<span>ectangle</span>(<span>point</span>, <span>point</span>)
  | `C<span>ircle</span>(<span>point</span>, <span>float</span>)
]</span>;
</code></pre>
<p>Based on these type definitions, we can write a function that computes the area of a shape:</p>
<pre><code><span>let</span> pi = <span>4.0</span><span> *. </span>atan(<span>1.0</span>);
<span>let</span> computeArea =<span> (<span>s</span>: <span>shape</span>) =&gt;</span>
  switch s {
  <span>| <span>`Rectangle(`Point(<span>x1</span>, <span>y1</span>)</span>, <span>`Point(<span>x2</span>, <span>y2</span>)</span>) =&gt;</span>
    <span>let</span> width = abs<span>_float(<span>x2</span> -. <span>x1</span>)</span>;
    <span>let</span> height = abs<span>_float(<span>y2</span> -. <span>y1</span>)</span>;
    width<span> *. </span>height;
  <span>| <span>`Circle(<span>_</span>, <span>radius</span>)</span> =&gt;</span> pi<span> *. </span>(radius<span> ** </span><span>2.0</span>)
  };
</code></pre>
<h3 id="extending-shape%3A-a-failing-first-attempt">Extending <code>shape</code>: a failing first attempt&nbsp;&nbsp;</h3>
<p>Let’s say we want to extend <code>shape</code> with one more shape – triangles. How would we do that? We can simply define a new type <code>shapePlus</code> that reuses the existing polymorphic constructors <code>Rectangle</code> and <code>Circle</code>, and adds the constructor <code>Triangle</code>:</p>
<pre><code><span>type</span> shapePlus = <span>[
  | `R<span>ectangle</span>(<span>point</span>, <span>point</span>)
  | `C<span>ircle</span>(<span>point</span>, <span>float</span>)
  | `T<span>riangle</span>(<span>point</span>, <span>point</span>, <span>point</span>)
]</span>;
</code></pre>
<p>Now we also need to extend <code>computeArea()</code>. The following function is our first attempt at writing that extension:</p>
<pre><code><span>let</span> shoelaceFormula =<span> (`P<span>oint</span>(<span>x1</span>, <span>y1</span>), `P<span>oint</span>(<span>x2</span>, <span>y2</span>), `P<span>oint</span>(<span>x3</span>, <span>y3</span>)) =&gt;</span>
  <span>0.5</span><span> *. </span>abs<span>_float(<span>x1</span><span>*</span>.<span>y2</span> -. <span>x3</span><span>*</span>.<span>y2</span> <span>+.</span> <span>x3</span><span>*</span>.<span>y1</span> -. <span>x1</span><span>*</span>.<span>y3</span> <span>+.</span> <span>x2</span><span>*</span>.<span>y3</span> -. <span>x2</span><span>*</span>.<span>y1</span>)</span>;
<span>let</span> computeAreaPlus =<span> (<span>sp</span>: <span>shapePlus</span>) =&gt;</span>
  switch sp {
  <span>| <span>`Triangle(<span>p1</span>, <span>p2</span>, <span>p3</span>)</span> =&gt;</span> shoelace<span>Formula(<span>p1</span>, <span>p2</span>, <span>p3</span>)</span>
  <span>| <span>`Rectangle(<span>_</span>, <span>_</span>)</span> =&gt;</span> compute<span>Area(<span>sp</span>)</span> 
  <span>| <span>`Circle(<span>_</span>, <span>_</span>)</span> =&gt;</span> compute<span>Area(<span>sp</span>)</span> 
  };
</code></pre>
<p>Alas, this code doesn’t work: In lines A and B, <code>sp</code>’s type <code>shapePlus</code> is not compatible with the type <code>shape</code> of <code>computeArea</code>’s parameter. We get the following error message:</p>
<pre><code>Error: This expression has <span>type</span> shapePlus
but an expression was expected <span>of</span> <span>type</span> shape
The second variant <span>type</span> does not allow tag(s) `Triangle
</code></pre>
<h3 id="fixing-computeareaplus-via-an-as-clause">Fixing <code>computeAreaPlus</code> via an <code>as</code> clause&nbsp;&nbsp;</h3>
<p>Thankfully, we can fix the problem by using the <code>as</code> clause for the last two cases:</p>
<pre><code><span>let</span> computeAreaPlus =<span> (<span>sp</span>: <span>shapePlus</span>) =&gt;</span>
  switch sp {
  <span>| <span>`Triangle(<span>p1</span>, <span>p2</span>, <span>p3</span>)</span> =&gt;</span> shoelace<span>Formula(<span>p1</span>, <span>p2</span>, <span>p3</span>)</span>
  <span>| <span>`Rectangle(<span>_</span>, <span>_</span>)</span> <span>as</span> r =&gt;</span> compute<span>Area(<span>r</span>)</span>
  <span>| <span>`Circle(<span>_</span>, <span>_</span>)</span> <span>as</span> c =&gt;</span> compute<span>Area(<span>c</span>)</span>
  };
</code></pre>
<p>How does <code>as</code> help us? With polymorphic variants, it picks the most general type possible. That is:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>r</code> has the type <code>[&gt; `Rectangle(point, point)]</code></li>
<li><code>c</code> has the type <code>[&gt; `Circle(point, float)]</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Both of these types are compatible with <code>shape</code>, the type of <code>computeArea</code>’s parameter.</p>
<h3 id="the-final-solution">The final solution&nbsp;&nbsp;</h3>
<p>There is one more improvement we can make. Given the following variant:</p>
<pre><code><span>type</span> myvariant = <span>[`C1(<span>t1</span>) | `C2(<span>t2</span>)]</span>;
</code></pre>
<p>Then the following two patterns are equivalent:</p>
<pre><code>#myvariant
(<span>`C1(<span>_</span>: <span>t1</span>)</span> <span>| <span>`C2(<span>_</span>: <span>t2</span>)</span>)
</span></code></pre>
<p>If we use the hash for the type <code>shape</code>, we get:</p>
<pre><code><span>let</span> computeAreaPlus =<span> (<span>sp</span>: <span>shapePlus</span>) =&gt;</span>
  switch sp {
  <span>| <span>`Triangle(<span>p1</span>, <span>p2</span>, <span>p3</span>)</span> =&gt;</span> shoelace<span>Formula(<span>p1</span>, <span>p2</span>, <span>p3</span>)</span>
  <span>| #shape <span>as</span> s =&gt;</span> compute<span>Area(<span>s</span>)</span>
  };
</code></pre>
<p>Let’s use <code>computeAreaPlus()</code> with two shapes:</p>
<pre><code><span>let</span> top = <span>`Point(3.0, 5.0)</span>;
<span>let</span> left = <span>`Point(0.0, 0.0)</span>;
<span>let</span> right = <span>`Point(3.0, 0.0)</span>;

<span>let</span> circ = <span>`Circle(<span>top</span>, 3.0)</span>;
<span>let</span> tri = <span>`Triangle(<span>top</span>, <span>left</span>, <span>right</span>)</span>;

compute<span>AreaPlus(<span>circ</span>)</span>; 
compute<span>AreaPlus(<span>tri</span>)</span>; 
</code></pre>
<p>We have therefore successfully extended both the type <code>shape</code> and the function <code>computeArea()</code> operating on it.</p>

December 14, 2020 | https://erikmcclure.com/blog/risc-is-fundamentally-unscalable/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://erikmcclure.com/blog/risc-is-fundamentally-unscalable/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Today, there was an announcement about <a href="https://twitter.com/Calista_Redmond/status/1154278392344305664">a new RISC-V chip</a>, which has got a lot of people excited. I wish I could also be excited, but to me, this is just a reminder that RISC architectures are fundamentally unscalable, and inevitably stop being RISC as soon as they need to be fast. People still call ARM a “RISC” architecture despite <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARM_architecture#ARMv8.3-A">ARMv8.3-A adding a <code>FJCVTZS</code> instruction</a>, which is “Floating-point Javascript Convert to Signed fixed-point, rounding toward Zero”. Reduced instruction set, my ass.</p><p>The reason this keeps happening is because <strong>the laws of physics</strong> ensure that no RISC architecture can scale under load. The problem is that a modern CPU is so fast that just accessing the L1 cache takes anywhere from <a href="https://www.7-cpu.com/cpu/Skylake_X.html">3-5 cycles</a>. This is part of the reason modern CPUs rely so much on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Register_renaming">register renaming</a>, allowing them to have hundreds of internal registers that are used to make things go fast, as opposed to the paltry <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86#/media/File:Table_of_x86_Registers_svg.svg">90 registers actually exposed</a>, 40 of which are just floating point registers for vector operations. The fundamental issue that CPU architects run into is that <strong>the speed of light isn't getting any faster</strong>. Even getting an electrical signal from one end of a CPU to the other now takes more than one cycle, which means the physical layout of your CPU now has a significant impact on how fast operations take. Worse, the faster the CPU gets, the more this lag becomes a problem, so unless you shrink the entire CPU or redesign it so your L1 and L2 caches are <em>physically closer to the transistors that need them</em>, the latency from accessing those caches can only go up, not down. The CPU might be getting faster, but the speed of light isn't.</p><p>Now, obviously RISC CPUs are very complicated architectures that do <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classic_RISC_pipeline#Hazard">all sorts of insane pipelining</a> to try and execute as many instructions at the same time as possible. This is necessary because, unless your data is already loaded into registers, you might spend more cycles <em>loading data from the L1 cache</em> than doing the actual operation! If you hit the L2 cache, that will cost you 13-20 cycles by itself, and L3 cache hits are 60-100 cycles. This is made worse by the fact that complex floating-point operations can almost always be performed faster by encoding the operation in hardware, often in just one or two cycles, when manually implementing the same operation would've taken 8 or more cycles. The <code>FJCVTZS</code> instruction mentioned above even <a href="https://community.arm.com/developer/ip-products/processors/b/processors-ip-blog/posts/armv8-a-architecture-2016-additions">sets a specific flag based on certain edge-cases</a> to allow an immediate jump instruction to be done afterwards, again to minimize hitting the cache.</p><p>All of this leads us to <strong>single instruction multiple data (SIMD)</strong> vector instructions common to almost all modern CPUs. Instead of doing a complex operation on a single float, they do a simple operation to many floats at once. The CPU can perform operations on 4, 8, or even 16 floating point numbers at the same time, in just 3 or 4 cycles, even though doing this for an individual float would have cost 2 or 3 cycles <em>each</em>. Even loading an array of floats into a large register will be faster than loading each float individually. There is no escaping the fact that attempting to run instructions one by one, even with fancy pipelining, will usually result in a CPU that's simply not doing anything most of the time. In order to make things go fast, you have to do things in bulk. This means having instructions that do as many things as possible, which is the exact opposite of how RISC works.</p><p>Now, this does not mean CISC is the future. We already invented a solution to this problem, which is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Very_long_instruction_word">VLIW - Very Large Instruction Word</a>. This is what Itanium was, because researchers at HP anticipated this problem <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Itanium#Development:_1989%E2%80%932000">30 years ago</a> and teamed up with Intel to create what eventually became <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Itanium">Itanium</a>. In Itanium, or any VLIW architecture, you can tell the CPU to do <strong>many things at once</strong>. This means that, instead of having to build massive vector processing instructions or other complex specialized instructions, you can build your own mega-instructions out of a much simpler instruction set. This is great, because it simplifies the CPU design enormously while sidestepping the pipelining issues of RISC. The problem is that <em>this is really fucking hard to compile</em>, and that's what Intel screwed up. Intel assumed that compilers in 2001 could extract the instruction-level parallelism necessary to make VLIW work, but in reality we've only <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1902.02816.pdf">very recently figured out how to reliably do that</a>. 20 years ago, we weren't even close, so nobody could compile fast code for Itanium, and now Itanium is dead, even though it was specifically designed to solve our current predicament.</p><p>With that said, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mill_architecture">MILL instruction set</a> uses VLIW along with several other innovations designed to compensate for a lot of the problems discussed here, like having <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8E4qs2irmpc&amp;t=26m45s">deferred load instructions</a> to account for the lag time between requesting a piece of data and actually being able to use it (which, incidentally, also makes MILL immune to Spectre because it doesn't need to speculate). Sadly, MILL is currently still vaporware, having not materialized any actual hardware despite it's promising performance gains. One reason for this might be that any VLIW architecture has a highly unique instruction set. We're used to x86, which is so high-level it has almost nothing to do with the underlying CPU implementation. This is nice, because everyone implements the same instruction set and your programs all work on it, but it means the way instructions interact is hard to predict, much to the frustration of compiler optimizers. With VLIW, you would very likely have to recompile your program for <strong>every single unique CPU</strong>, which is a problem <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mill_architecture#Family_traits">MILL has spent quite a bit of time on</a>.</p><p>MILL, and perhaps VLIW in general, may have a saving grace with <a href="https://webassembly.org/">WebAssembly</a>, precisely because it is a low-level assembly language that can be efficiently compiled to any architecture. It wouldn't be a problem to have unique instruction sets for every single type of CPU, because if you ship WebAssembly, you can simply compile the program for whatever CPU it happens to be running on. A lot of people miss this benefit of WebAssembly, even though I think it will be critical in allowing VLIW instruction sets to eventually proliferate. Perhaps MILL will see the light of day after all, or maybe someone else can come up with a VLIW version of RISC-V that's open-source. Either way, we need to stop pretending that pipelining RISC is going to work. It hasn't ever worked and it's not going to work, it'll just turn into another CISC with a javascript floating point conversion instruction.</p><p>Every. Single. Time.</p></div></div>]]>

                    <p>I'm pretty impressed by what I've seen with Apple's M1 Chip. It's really fast and powerful for essential everyday tasks, which include browsing the web, working with Intel-based apps, and using programming apps. Yes – the ecosystem is moving, and that may take time, but I think M1 is worth paying for it because of its phenomenal performance.</p><p>M1 is fast, and many benchmarks have proved its performance. However, I was curious about the performance of the programming languages using M1. So I decided to test it for the most popular workloads here.</p><p>Before you see the results, you should know that some benchmark suites are memory-intensive, some are CPU-intensive, and some have no benefits with multi-core processing because of its overhead or its difficulty for utilizing. It means that M1 can have an advantage over the desktop-class multi-core Ryzen processor even though the core count is lesser. <strong>Most importantly, I've focused more on real-world development performance testing rather than synthetic, production tests.</strong></p><p>You can check the raw benchmark data <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1g4U7LAImfEcXRihJbySZcRr32tn6WSWAtslfXltds58/edit?usp=sharing">here</a>.</p><p>I add the following comment as of Dec 14: we care how fast our dev computer runs. the multi-core advantage of 3900X is useless for most of the benchmarks here that don't represent the real-world production performance at all but devs usually work on their laptops, desktops, etc most of the time so I think such real-world development performance benchmarks make it worthwhile though. of course, Ryzen 3900X will perform way better than M1 and Intel when it comes to production, mostly achieved by parallelizing.</p><h2 id="test-environment">Test Environment</h2><ul><li>Apple M1: Mac Mini (16GB RAM), MacBook Air (8GB RAM) / macOS Big Sur 11.0.1 (All executables used for benchmarks are natively compiled for Apple Silicon.)</li><li>Ryzen 3900X: ASRock Rack X570D4I-2T / 16GB DDR4-3200 x 2 / Ubuntu 20.04.1 LTS (tested after shutting down background tasks.) – You may wonder why I used 3900X instead of Ryzen 5000-series CPUs: Because I don't have it.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
  
    <p>As we all know, Cyberpunk 2077 had a rocky start, but it’s not unexpected with a game of this scope.
It came to my attention that it’s been investigated that the game doesn’t take advantage of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simultaneous_multithreading">SMT</a> 
on AMD CPUs and that there’s a fix for it. While the discovery was legitimate and interesting,
it was quickly followed by misinformation and strong statements. In this post,
I’ll summarize my findings previously scattered around Reddit and <strong>try</strong> to clarify some of the statements.</p>

<p><strong>DISCLAIMER: I tried to present those findings the best I could. However, it is not possible to be 100% certain about the choices made
by the dev team nor whether the fix is universally beneficial. You may rely on profiling data gathered from the community,
but only in-depth profiling of the game’s code can provide an indisputable answer. This is not something we can do.</strong></p>

<hr>

<p>First of all, credits for finding this go to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/UnhingedDoork/">UnhingedDoork</a>
(aka <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/BS_BlackScout/">BS_BlackScout</a>).
He dived into the game’s binary and found an interesting piece of code, checking via <code>cpuid</code> for the CPU vendor and some other
attributes (later revealed to be CPU family). That’s how this function looks in pseudocode (variables omitted for readability):</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>int</span> <span>sub_142A82270</span><span>()</span>
<span>{</span>
  <span>sub_142A822F0</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>v17</span><span>,</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>v16</span><span>);</span>
  <span>cpuid</span><span>(</span><span>0</span><span>);</span>
  <span>v13</span> <span>=</span> <span>_RDX</span><span>;</span>
  <span>v14</span> <span>=</span> <span>_RCX</span><span>;</span>
  <span>Str1</span> <span>=</span> <span>_RBX</span><span>;</span>
  <span>if</span> <span>(</span> <span>strcmp</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>Str1</span><span>,</span> <span>"AuthenticAMD"</span><span>)</span> <span>!=</span> <span>0</span> <span>)</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>v16</span><span>;</span>

  <span>cpuid</span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>);</span>
  <span>v10</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>_RAX</span> <span>&gt;&gt;</span> <span>8</span><span>)</span> <span>&amp;</span> <span>0xF</span><span>;</span>
  <span>if</span> <span>(</span> <span>v10</span> <span>==</span> <span>15</span> <span>)</span>
    <span>v10</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>_RAX</span> <span>&gt;&gt;</span> <span>20</span><span>)</span> <span>+</span> <span>15</span><span>;</span>
  <span>result</span> <span>=</span> <span>v17</span><span>;</span>
  <span>if</span> <span>(</span> <span>v10</span> <span>==</span> <span>21</span> <span>)</span>
    <span>result</span> <span>=</span> <span>v16</span><span>;</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>result</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The proposed fix neutralizes the <code>strcmp</code> check, making all CPUs take the <code>return v16</code> code path, previously taken only by Intel.
This very simple change reportedly can result in huge performance boosts on some configurations – while I haven’t been able to verify it myself,
reports came from various places and they generally seem great, with some people getting moderate gains while others getting huge speedups.
Do note, however, that there have also been reports of no performance increase, so this change should not be considered a “silver bullet for performance”.</p>

<p>Sadly, this great find quickly sparkled incorrect conclusions. I first learned of this issue from a topic named</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Cyberpunk 2077 used an Intel C++ compiler which hinders optimizations if run on non-Intel CPUs</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>which naturally caused people to come up with conspiracy theories. However, knowing that the Visual Studio compiler is pretty much an industry-standard
I’d be very surprised if this was true, so I dived and checked what this code truly is.</p>

<p>I originally posted my findings <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/pcgaming/comments/kbsywg/cyberpunk_2077_used_an_intel_c_compiler_which/gfknein/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3">on Reddit</a>,
and they are as follows:</p>
<ul>
  <li>This check doesn’t come from ICC, but from <a href="https://github.com/GPUOpen-LibrariesAndSDKs/cpu-core-counts/blob/master/windows/ThreadCount-Win7.cpp#L69">GPUOpen</a>, a library from AMD which is also mentioned
in the game’s credits. Comparing the game’s function with the linked one reveals they are identical. There is no evidence that Cyberpunk uses ICC,
furthermore according to VirusTotal Visual Studio 2015 compiler has been used.</li>
  <li>With this knowledge, we can see that on non-Bulldozer AMD CPUs the function returns the number of physical cores, while for Intel and AMD Bulldozer chips it returns the number of logical cores.
With this change in place, the function returns the number of logical cores regardless of the CPU vendor.</li>
  <li>This function is used in numerous places, but most notably it is used in what appears to be an initialization function of the game’s job dispatcher system.
This value seems to drive a <code>MaxHWConcurrency</code> attribute, so in my opinion, it may be used e.g. to decide how many worker threads to spawn. This would at least explain higher CPU usage,
since this change most likely gives the game’s job system twice the amount of threads, thus distributing the work across logical cores more evenly.</li>
</ul>

<p>Why was it done? I don’t know, since it comes from GPUOpen I don’t think this check is “wrong” per se, but maybe it should not have been used in Cyberpunk due to the way it utilizes threads.
Even the comment in this code snippet advises caution, after all. Again, <strong>we can’t know for certain</strong>, but in my opinion, this decision could have been made due to any of the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li>At some point, this change resulted in a performance boost but later changes and/or optimization may have made it less effective.</li>
  <li>Reportedly, this change helps AMD CPUs with one CCX unit and can make the game slower on CPUs with multiple CCX units. This code may have been tailored to only one type of CPU
and not the other.</li>
</ul>

<p>Lastly, I’d just like to highlight what <a href="https://gpuopen.com/learn/cpu-core-count-detection-windows/">AMD says about this GPUOpen functionality</a> (emphasis mine):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Our sample code, linked below, errs on the side of caution for our Ryzen processors and encourages you to profile: the <code>getDefaultThreadCount()</code> function draws attention to that fact, 
<strong>returning a starting default count equal to the number of physical processor cores on Ryzen.</strong></p>
</blockquote>



<p>It goes without saying that I cannot guarantee any improvements with this change applied, but you’re welcome to experiment.
Again, the original author of those instructions is <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/kbp0np/cyberpunk_2077_seems_to_ignore_smt_and_mostly/gfkmc7d/?context=3">UnhingedDoork</a>
and I am only mirroring them here. Since I don’t have an AMD CPU, I cannot test those:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Open the EXE with HxD (Hex Editor).</li>
  <li>Look for a <code>75 30 33 C9 B8 01 00 00 00 0F A2 8B C8 C1 F9 08</code> hex string.</li>
  <li>Change it to <code>EB 30 33 C9 B8 01 00 00 00 0F A2 8B C8 C1 F9 08</code>.</li>
</ol>

<p>Alternately, you may try a <a href="https://github.com/yamashi/PerformanceOverhaulCyberpunk">PerformanceOverhaulCyberpunk</a> mod which applies those changes, similarly to my ASI-based mods.
Again, I have not tested this, so I cannot guarantee any improvements. Use with caution.</p>

<p>I have been working on porting GLIBC to the OpenRISC architecture.  This has
taken longer than I expected as with GLIBC upstreaming we must get every
test to pass.  This was different compared to GDB and GCC which were a
bit more lenient.</p>

<p>My <a href="https://lists.librecores.org/pipermail/openrisc/2020-May/002602.html">first upstreaming attempt</a>
was completely tested on the <a href="https://www.qemu.org/">QEMU</a> simulator.  I have
since added an FPGA <a href="https://github.com/enjoy-digital/litex/blob/master/README.md">LiteX SoC</a>
to my test platform options.  LiteX runs Linux on the OpenRISC mor1kx softcore
and tests are loaded over an SSH session.  The SoC eliminates an issue I was
seeing on the simulator where under heavy load it appears the <a href="https://github.com/openrisc/linux/issues/12">MMU starves the kernel</a>
from getting any work done.</p>

<p>To get to where I am now this required:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Fixing buggy <a href="https://github.com/litex-hub/linux/commit/78969c54328e35b360d9452c7602f21107a13d22">LiteETH network driver</a>
in LiteX.</li>
  <li>Updating the OpenRISC GDB port to <a href="https://github.com/stffrdhrn/binutils-gdb/commit/9d0d2e9bef5c84caa7f05cc7ddba1e092e2b5120">support gdbserver</a>
and <a href="https://github.com/stffrdhrn/binutils-gdb/commit/82e99d5df56be3b18c63e613d00e2367fb5a78b7">native debugging</a></li>
  <li>Fixing bugs in the <a href="https://github.com/stffrdhrn/linux/commit/28b852b1dc351efc6525234c5adfd5bc2ad6d6e1">Linux Kernel</a> and
<a href="https://github.com/stffrdhrn/or1k-glibc/commit/75ddf155968299042e4d2b492e3b547c86d4672e">GLIBC</a> to get gdbserver and native support working</li>
</ul>

<p>Adding GDB Linux debugging support is great because it allows debugging of
multithreaded processes and signal handling; which we are going to need.</p>

<h2 id="a-bug">A Bug</h2>

<p>Our story starts when I was trying to fix a failing GLIBC <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Native_POSIX_Thread_Library">NPTL</a>
test case.  The test case involves C++ exceptions and POSIX threads.
The issue is that the <code>catch</code> block of a <code>try/catch</code> block is not
being called.  Where do we even start?</p>

<p>My plan for approaching test case failures is:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Understand what the test case is trying to test and where its failing</li>
  <li>Create a hypothesis about where the problem is</li>
  <li>Understand how the failing API’s works internally</li>
  <li>Debug until we find the issue</li>
  <li>If we get stuck go back to <code>2.</code></li>
</ol>

<p>Let’s have a try.</p>

<h3 id="understanding-the-test-case">Understanding the Test case</h3>

<p>The GLIBC test case is <a href="https://sourceware.org/git/?p=glibc.git;a=blob;f=nptl/tst-cancel24.cc;h=1af709a8cab1d422ef4401e2b2d178df86f863c5;hb=HEAD">nptl/tst-cancel24.cc</a>.
The test starts in the <code>do_test</code> function and it will create a child thread with <code>pthread_create</code>.
The child thread executes function <code>tf</code> which waits on a semaphore until the parent thread cancels it.  It
is expected that the child thread, when cancelled , will call it’s catch block.</p>

<p>The failure is that the <code>catch</code> block is not getting run as evidenced by the <code>except_caught</code> variable
not being set to <code>true</code>.</p>

<p>Below is an excerpt from the test showing the <code>tf</code> function.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>static</span> <span>void</span> <span>*</span>
<span>tf</span> <span>(</span><span>void</span> <span>*</span><span>arg</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>sem_t</span> <span>*</span><span>s</span> <span>=</span> <span>static_cast</span><span>&lt;</span><span>sem_t</span> <span>*&gt;</span> <span>(</span><span>arg</span><span>);</span>

  <span>try</span> <span>{</span>
      <span>monitor</span> <span>m</span><span>;</span>

      <span>pthread_barrier_wait</span> <span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>b</span><span>);</span>

      <span>while</span> <span>(</span><span>1</span><span>)</span>
        <span>sem_wait</span> <span>(</span><span>s</span><span>);</span>
  <span>}</span> <span>catch</span> <span>(...)</span> <span>{</span>
      <span>except_caught</span> <span>=</span> <span>true</span><span>;</span>
      <span>throw</span><span>;</span>
  <span>}</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>NULL</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>So the <code>catch</code> block is not being run.  Simple, but where do we start to
debug that?  Let’s move onto the next step.</p>

<h3 id="creating-a-hypothesis">Creating a Hypothesis</h3>

<p>This one is a bit tricky as it seems C++ <code>try/catch</code> blocks are broken. Here, I am
working on GLIBC testing, what does that have to do with C++?</p>

<p>To get a better idea of where the problem is I tried to modify the test to test
some simple ideas. First, maybe there is a problem with catching exceptions
throws from thread child functions.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>static</span> <span>void</span> <span>do_throw</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span> <span>throw</span> <span>99</span><span>;</span> <span>}</span>

<span>static</span> <span>void</span> <span>*</span> <span>tf</span> <span>()</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>try</span> <span>{</span>
      <span>monitor</span> <span>m</span><span>;</span>
      <span>while</span> <span>(</span><span>1</span><span>)</span> <span>do_throw</span><span>();</span>
  <span>}</span> <span>catch</span> <span>(...)</span> <span>{</span>
      <span>except_caught</span> <span>=</span> <span>true</span><span>;</span>
  <span>}</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>NULL</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>No, this works correctly.  So <code>try/catch</code> is working.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Hypothesis</strong>: There is a problem handling exceptions while in a syscall.
There may be something broken with OpenRISC related to how we setup stack
frames for syscalls that makes the unwinder fail.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>How does that work?  Let’s move onto the next step.</p>

<h3 id="understanding-the-internals">Understanding the Internals</h3>

<p>To find this bug we need to understand how C++ exceptions work.  Also, we need to know
what happens when a thread is cancelled in a multithreaded
(<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/POSIX_Threads">pthread</a>) glibc environment.</p>

<p>There are a few contributors pthread cancellation and C++ exceptions which are:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>DWARF</strong> - provided by our program and libraries in the <code>.eh_frame</code> ELF
section</li>
  <li><strong>GLIBC</strong> - provides the pthread runtime and cleanup callbacks to the GCC unwinder code</li>
  <li><strong>GCC</strong> - provides libraries for dealing with exceptions
    <ul>
      <li><code>libgcc_s.so</code> - handles unwinding by reading program <strong>DWARF</strong> metadata and doing the frame decoding</li>
      <li><code>libstdc++.so.6</code> - provides the C++ personality routine which
identifies and prepares <code>catch</code> blocks for execution</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 id="dwarf">DWARF</h4>
<p>ELF binaries provide debugging information in a data format called
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DWARF">DWARF</a>.  The name was chosen to maintain a
fantasy theme.  Lately the Linux community has a new debug format called
<a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/728339/">ORC</a>.</p>

<p>Though DWARF is a debugging format and usually stored in <code>.debug_frame</code>,
<code>.debug_info</code>, etc sections, a stripped down version it is used for exception
handling.</p>

<p>Each ELF binary that supports unwinding contains the <code>.eh_frame</code> section to
provide unwinding information.  This can be seen with the <code>readelf</code> program.</p>

<p>We can decode the metadata using <code>readelf</code> as well using the
<code>--debug-dump=frames-interp</code> and <code>--debug-dump=frames</code> arguments.</p>

<p>The <code>frames</code> dump provides a raw output of the DWARF metadata for each frame.
This is not usually as useful as <code>frames-interp</code>, but it shows how the DWARF
format is actually a bytecode.  The DWARF interpreter needs to execute these
operations to understand how to derive the values of registers based current PC.</p>

<p>There is an interesting talk in <a href="https://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/~sergey/battleaxe/hackito_2011_oakley_bratus.pdf">Exploiting the hard-working
DWARF.pdf</a>.</p>

<p>An example of the <code>frames</code> dump:</p>

<p>The <code>frames-interp</code> argument is a bit more clear as it shows the interpreted output

<ul>
  <li><code>CIE</code> - Common Information Entry</li>
  <li><code>FDE</code> - Frame Description Entry</li>
</ul>

<p>The <code>CIE</code> provides starting point information for each child <code>FDE</code> entry.  Some
things to point out: we see <code>ra=9</code> indicates the return address is stored in
register <code>r9</code>,  we see CFA <code>r1+0</code> indicates the canonical frame pointer is stored in
register <code>r1</code> and we see the stack frame size is <code>4</code> bytes.</p>

<h4 id="glibc">GLIBC</h4>

<p>GLIBC provides <code>pthreads</code> which when used with C++ needs to support exception
handling.  The main place exceptions are used with <code>pthreads</code> is when cancelling
threads.  When using <code>pthread_cancel</code> a cancel signal is sent to the target thread using <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/tgkill.2.html">tgkill</a>
which causes an exception.</p>

<p>This is implemented with the below APIs.</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://sourceware.org/git/?p=glibc.git;a=blob;f=nptl/nptl-init.c;h=53b817715d58192857ed14450052e16dc34bc01b;hb=HEAD#l126">sigcancel_handler</a> -
Setup during the pthread runtime initialization, it handles cancellation,
which calls <code>__do_cancel</code>, which calls <code>__pthread_unwind</code>.</li>
  <li><a href="https://sourceware.org/git/?p=glibc.git;a=blob;f=nptl/unwind.c;h=8f157e49f4a088ac64722e85ff24514fff7f3c71;hb=HEAD#l121">__pthread_unwind</a> -
Is called with <code>pd-&gt;cancel_jmp_buf</code>.  It calls glibc’s <code>__Unwind_ForcedUnwind</code>.</li>
  <li><a href="https://sourceware.org/git/?p=glibc.git;a=blob;f=sysdeps/nptl/unwind-forcedunwind.c;h=50a089282bc236aa644f40feafd0dacdafe3a4e7;hb=HEAD#l122">_Unwind_ForcedUnwind</a> -
Loads GCC’s <code>libgcc_s.so</code> version of <code>_Unwind_ForcedUnwind</code>
and calls it with parameters:
    <ul>
      <li><code>exc</code> - the exception context</li>
      <li><code>unwind_stop</code> - the stop callback to GLIBC, called for each frame of the unwind, with
the stop argument <code>ibuf</code></li>
      <li><code>ibuf</code> - the <code>jmp_buf</code>, created by <code>setjmp</code> (<code>self-&gt;cancel_jmp_buf</code>) in <code>start_thread</code></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><a href="https://sourceware.org/git/?p=glibc.git;a=blob;f=nptl/unwind.c;h=8f157e49f4a088ac64722e85ff24514fff7f3c71;hb=HEAD#l39">unwind_stop</a> -
Checks the current state of unwind and call the <code>cancel_jmp_buf</code> if
we are at the end of stack.  When the <code>cancel_jmp_buf</code> is called the thread
exits.</li>
</ul>

<p>Let’s look at <code>pd-&gt;cancel_jmp_buf</code> in more details.  The <code>cancel_jmp_buf</code> is
setup during <code>pthread_create</code> after clone in <a href="https://sourceware.org/git/?p=glibc.git;a=blob;f=nptl/pthread_create.c;h=bad4e57a845bd3148ad634acaaccbea08b04dbbd;hb=HEAD#l406">start_thread</a>.
It uses the <a href="https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/setjmp.3.html">setjmp</a> and
<a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/longjmp.3.html">longjump</a> non local goto mechanism.</p>

<p>Let’s look at some diagrams.</p>

<p><img src="http://stffrdhrn.github.io/content/2020/pthread-normal-seq.png" alt="Pthread Normal"></p>

<p>The above diagram shows a pthread that exits normally.  During the <em>Start</em> phase
of the thread <code>setjmp</code> will create the <code>cancel_jmp_buf</code>. After the thread
routine exits …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>How should two microservices communicate?</p>
<p>Let’s analyze two different communication patterns:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Polling</strong>:  Service <em>B</em> periodically query Service <em>A</em> for the current state of the users and updates its local storage.</li>
<li><strong>Event driven</strong>: Service <em>A</em> publishes in a queue every time user information is updated. Service <em>B</em> consumes the updates to stay up to date.</li>
</ul>
<p>Using <a href="https://lamport.azurewebsites.net/tla/tla.html">TLA+</a> we are going to model the two different patterns to see how well they fit our requirements.
In our specification, we are also going to take into account unexpected failures that can affect the system and show how to model them in TLA+.</p>
<p>Let’s specify our requirements with an example.</p>
<p>Imagine you have two services, one holding user information and another one in need of user information to properly function, for example it could be sending out promotional emails to you register users for new and upcoming products.
Let’s call them services <em>A</em> and <em>B</em> from now on from simplicity.</p>
<p>Service <em>B</em> does not have to be immediately notified about users joining or leaving the system, but it <strong>must</strong> know about them eventually.</p>
<h2 id="resiliency">Resiliency</h2>
<p>First lets specify what we mean in resiliecy using TLA+.</p>
<p>Let’s call <code>dataSourceA</code> and <code>dataSourceB</code>, the information stored in Services <em>A</em> and <em>B</em> respectively which we want to keep in sync.</p>
<pre><code>Resiliency == []&lt;&gt;(dataSourceB = dataSourceA)
</code></pre><p>The formula specifies that as the system evolves <code>dataSourceB</code> and  <code>dataSourceA</code> become equal an infinite number of times.
Thus, even if at some point diverge, for whatever reason, at a later point they will become equal again.</p>
<p>The operators <code>[]&lt;&gt;</code> can be read as <em>always eventually</em>.
TLA+ makes it easy to express formulas related to how your systems evolve through time.</p>
<h2 id="polling">Polling</h2>
<h3 id="the-specification">The specification</h3>
<pre><code>-------------------- MODULE PollMechanism --------------------
EXTENDS Naturals, Integers, TLC

VARIABLES dataSourceA, dataSourceB

vars == &lt;&lt;dataSourceA, dataSourceB&gt;&gt;

Poll ==
    /\ dataSourceB'= dataSourceA
    /\ UNCHANGED &lt;&lt;dataSourceA&gt;&gt;

Update ==
    /\ \E u \in DOMAIN dataSourceA: \E v \in 1..10:
        /\ dataSourceA' =  [ dataSourceA EXCEPT  ![u] = v ]
    /\ UNCHANGED &lt;&lt;dataSourceB&gt;&gt;

Environment == /\ dataSourceB' \in [u1: 1..10, u2: 1..10]
               /\ UNCHANGED &lt;&lt;dataSourceA&gt;&gt;

Init ==
    /\ dataSourceA = [u1 |-&gt; 1, u2 |-&gt; 1]
    /\ dataSourceB = [u1 |-&gt; 1, u2 |-&gt; 1]

Next == \/ Poll \/ Update \/ Environment

Spec == Init /\ [][Next]_vars /\ WF_vars(Poll)

TypeOK ==
    /\ \A u \in DOMAIN dataSourceA: dataSourceA[u] \in 1..10
    /\ \A u \in DOMAIN dataSourceB: dataSourceB[u] \in 0..10

Resilient == []&lt;&gt;(dataSourceB = dataSourceA)
===============================================================
</code></pre><p>The datasources hold the records of two users <em>u1</em> and <em>u2</em>.
The state of each user is represented by a number for simplicity.</p>
<p>The following three actions are possible in the system:</p>
<ul>
<li>Service <em>A</em> can <code>Update</code> the state of one of the users.</li>
<li>Service <em>B</em> can <code>Poll</code> to sync it’s state, <code>dataSourceB</code>, with Service’s <em>A</em> state,  <code>dataSourceA</code></li>
<li>The <code>Environment</code> can kick Service <em>B</em> out of sync.
This action models the effects of bugs, malicious actors, misunderstood requirements or anything that wrecks havoc to your system.</li>
</ul>
<p>TLC, the model checker for TLA+, validates that our specification satisfies our resiliency requirement!</p>
<p>Conceptually, even if Service <em>B</em> falls behind Service <em>A</em> or if an external factor kicks Service <em>B</em> out of sync, it only takes one successful poll to bring everything back in sync. Simple and effective.</p>
<h2 id="event-driven">Event driven</h2>
<p>Now, let’s try to solve the same problem using an event driven solution.
Service <em>A</em> will be publishing messages with user updates and Service <em>B</em> will be receiving them and use them to update its state.</p>
<p>Here’s the specification:</p>
<pre><code>-------------------- MODULE PushMechanism --------------------
EXTENDS Naturals, Sequences, Integers, TLC

VARIABLES dataSourceA, dataSourceB, queue

MaxQueueLength == 1

vars == &lt;&lt;dataSourceA, dataSourceB, queue&gt;&gt;

Update ==
    /\ Len(queue) # MaxQueueLength
    /\ \E u \in DOMAIN dataSourceA: \E v \in 1..10:
        /\ dataSourceA' =  [ dataSourceA EXCEPT  ![u] = v ]
        /\ queue' = Append(queue, &lt;&lt;u, v&gt;&gt; )
    /\ UNCHANGED &lt;&lt;dataSourceB&gt;&gt;

Receive ==
    /\ Len(queue) # 0
    /\ LET
            u == Head(queue)[1]
            v == Head(queue)[2]
        IN
        /\ dataSourceB' = [ dataSourceB EXCEPT ![u] = v ]
        /\ queue' = Tail(queue)
    /\ UNCHANGED &lt;&lt;dataSourceA&gt;&gt;

Environment ==
    /\ dataSourceB' \in [u1: 1..10, u2: 1..10]
    /\ UNCHANGED &lt;&lt;dataSourceA, queue&gt;&gt;

Init ==
    /\ dataSourceA = [u1 |-&gt; 1, u2 |-&gt; 1]
    /\ dataSourceB = [u1 |-&gt; 1, u2 |-&gt; 1]
    /\ queue = &lt;&lt;&gt;&gt;

Next == \/ Update \/ Receive \/ Environment

Spec == Init /\ [][Next]_vars  /\ WF_vars(Update) /\ WF_vars(Receive)

TypeOK ==
    /\ \A u \in DOMAIN dataSourceA: dataSourceA[u] \in 1..10
    /\ \A u \in DOMAIN dataSourceB: dataSourceB[u] \in 0..10
    /\ Len(queue) \in 0..1

Resilient == []&lt;&gt;(dataSourceB = dataSourceA)
===============================================================
</code></pre><p>TLC finds the following counter example which demonstrates that the specification does not satisfy the resiliency property:</p>
<ol>
<li><code>Environment</code> messes up the state of both users in <code>dataSourceB</code>.</li>
<li>Service <em>A</em> <code>Update</code> the state of <em>u1</em> and publishes a message in the queue.</li>
<li>Service <em>B</em> <code>Receive</code> the message and updates <em>u1</em> record in <code>dataSourceB</code> accordingly.</li>
<li>In the next steps, Service <em>A</em> keeps updating <em>u1</em> but because there is no update for <em>u2</em> the <code>dataSourceB</code> remains out of sync for <em>u2</em>.</li>
</ol>
<p>Intuitively, only for values for which you have recently received updates, you can be confident that they are in sync with the source.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>The plain old polling is still a strategy worth considering when resiliency is important.
Since, it only takes one successful poll to bring everything back to order.</p>
<p>Also, I believe that it better aligns with the needs of the services.
In this example, it is Service <em>B</em> that is in need of some data.
With polling, service <em>B</em> is in charge of initiating the exchange of data whenever and for whichever subset of data, it really needs to know about.</p>
<p>When Service <em>A</em> is in charge of initiating the exchange, Service <em>B</em> may receive multiple updates for entities it does not need to know about and more importantly it may not get updates for entities it needs to know about (as in the counter-example where it did not receive updates for <em>u2</em>).</p>
<p>TLA+ is an amazing tool to help you explore the properties of distributed systems.
In this post, I demonstrate an easy technique to model external factors that can affect your system.</p>

<p>Today we have three major record labels, the meanest, most voracious gobblers-up of the competition, companies that clawed their way to global dominance through absolute ruthlessness, particularly to the musicians who did the work that brought in the money.</p>
<p>For example: the Beatles earned $0.01/record.</p>
<p>Split four ways.</p>
<p>But 15% of that was creamed off by the label to account for "promotional copies" that they later admitted they sold at full price without giving the Beatles their <em>one penny</em> of royalties.</p>
<p>When Napster and other digital distribution platforms appeared, many musicians were angry about them, but many were hopeful: was this – finally – a way to be free of the labels?</p>
<p>It was!</p>
<p>For a while.</p>
<p>The subsequent record industry lawsuits combined with runaway mergers and acquisitions in <em>both</em> tech (5 giants) <em>and</em> entertainment (4 studios, 4ish publishers, 3 labels) killed the dream of a pluralistic, fair alternative to the content oligarchy.</p>
<p>This was confirmed when Youtube launched its music service in the early part of the past decade. After hammering out a deal with the Big Four (now three) labels, YT told all the independent artists and labels that this would be their deal too – or they could leave Youtube.</p>
<p>In other words, Youtube was now an honorary member of the Big Four (now three) and every musician in the world who wanted access to the monopoly audio-video distribution platform would have to toe the Big Four's (now three) line…or else.</p>
<p>The fusion of Youtube with the big entertainment companies includes a complete disregard for fair use – the limitations and exceptions to copyright that are so necessary to free speech, criticism, and new artistic expression.</p>
<p>It's hard to square copyright with the First Amendment ("Congress shall make no law.. abridging the freedom of speech"). I wrote this, it attracted a copyright at the moment of fixation, and now the US government gives me to the power to bar you from repeating it.</p>
<p>How can a government that is constitutionally barred from abridging your speech also have a law telling you what you're allowed to say?</p>
<p>The Supreme Court explored this in Eldred v Ashcroft, with RBG calling fair use copyright's "safety valve."</p>
<p>Fair use is how you can ban people from saying stuff without abridging their free speech: it allows for transformation, criticism, commentary, education, parody, archiving and a host of other uses. Without fair use, copyright is unconstitutional censorship.</p>
<p>In 2007, Viacom sued Youtube for $1b; the court released emails between Viacom execs admitting that their goal was to "steal" Youtube and take it over (the emails were <em>very</em> sweary and included vicious fights about which exec would get to run YT)</p>
<p><a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/1588353/steal-it-and-other-internal-youtube-emails-viacoms-copyright-suit">https://www.fastcompany.com/1588353/steal-it-and-other-internal-youtube-emails-viacoms-copyright-suit</a></p>
<p>As the suit was making its way through the courts, Youtube launched Content ID, its automated takedown system. Content ID – which cost $100m to build and run – allowed select rightsholders to "claim" certain audio and video elements as their copyrights.</p>
<p>Content ID scours uploaded videos for matches to claimed works, then (depending on rightsholders' preferences), Content ID either removes the matching video, takes the money it is generating, or (if it's ad-free) puts ads all over it and gives the money to the rightsholder.</p>
<p>And Content ID can't figure out if a use is fair or not. No algorithm can. How software tell if something is parody? If it's commentary? If it's sufficiently transformative to constitute a fair use? It can't, and so Content ID doesn't.</p>
<p>What do you get when you mix automated takedown, entertainment and tech monopolies and the absolute annihilation of fair use?</p>
<p>The contemporary arts world.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eff.org/wp/unfiltered-how-youtubes-content-id-discourages-fair-use-and-dictates-what-we-see-online">https://www.eff.org/wp/unfiltered-how-youtubes-content-id-discourages-fair-use-and-dictates-what-we-see-online</a></p>
<p>In a superb white paper, my EFF colleague Katharine Trendacosta painstakingly documents how Youtube transfers gigantic sums from working artists to rent-collecting rightsholders in a system that incentivizes false copyright claims and punishes those who appeal automated verdicts.</p>
<p>The paper starts by documenting how Content ID <em>really</em> works, and shows how the pretty, streamlined, easy to follow flowcharts that YT publishes to prove that it has a fair and transparent systems are a sham.</p>
<p><img src="https://i1.wp.com/craphound.com/images/contentidclaimed.jpg?w=840&amp;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i1.wp.com/craphound.com/images/contentidclaimed.jpg?w=840&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></p>
<p>The reality is a giant, gnarly hairball of rules, threats, ultimatums and dire punishments, where videos that pass muster one day can be taken down the next, and where challenging the robot (or a rightsholder) can annihilate your Youtube account – and thus your artistic career.</p>
<p><img src="https://i0.wp.com/craphound.com/images/contentideactual.jpg?w=840&amp;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i0.wp.com/craphound.com/images/contentideactual.jpg?w=840&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></p>
<p>It's a system where creators producing major video essays can upload them in five minute chunks to YT to check for copyright claims, find none, piece the whole feature together and upload it – only to get five copyright claims.</p>
<p>It's a system where a ten-hour video of white noise attracts <em>six</em> copyright claims – one for an "infringement" that allegedly lasted for less than <em>one second</em>.</p>
<p>Trendacosta's paper revolves around deep interviews with three very different Youtubers.</p>
<p>The first is Hbomberguy, a long-form video essayist with 600k subscribers, who spends weeks playing blind man's bluff with Content ID, slicing more and more sections out of his video to get rid of copyright claims (and doing it over again when the algorithm changes).</p>
<p>The second is Todd Nathanson, a musicologist who produces videos that dive deep into one-hit wonders and other musical oddities. He has given up on getting any of the money his wildly popular videos generate through YT ads; it's impossible to fend off the Content ID robots.</p>
<p>Instead, Nathanson relies on Patreon subscribers to pay his bills, and allows the rightholders who lay claim to the money from his legal, canonical-fair-use musical excerpts to simply steal the money he is entitled to.</p>
<p>Finally, there's Lindsay Ellis, a bestselling novelist with 1m subscribers who has been shunted from one service to the next as all of Youtube's competitors were driven out of business, landing on Youtube after she ran out of alternatives.</p>
<p>Ellis's high profile means she can sometimes actually reach a human being at Youtube to discuss copyright claims against her work, but they are monumentally unhelpful. Ellis knows an awful lot about copyright, but that's actually a detriment when it comes to Content ID.</p>
<p>That's because defending yourself to the Content ID system means that rightsholders can deny your defense and generate "copystrikes" against your account. Rack up three strikes and your account gets suspended or even deleted.</p>
<p>Ellis wonders "why I bothered playing by the rules all these years because fair use doesn’t matter. Content ID is all that matters."</p>
<p>Youtube's Content ID statistics are opaque and out of date, but Trendacosta estimates that the system rendered automated judgements in 122,500,000 copyright claims in 2017, a number that has surely climbed since.</p>
<p>Once, creators dreamed of the internet as an escape hatch from the airtight cell that the Big Four (now three) labels had crammed all the world's music into. Today, most creators have been corralled into a single online platform.</p>
<p>That platform colludes with the Big Three to misappropriate the incomes of artists who never signed their one-sided record deals, and the ripoff continues with a long tail of penny-ante grifters who claim copyrights over silence, white noise and birdsong.</p>

<p>The third stage of grief is bargaining. When the climate emergency hove into sight, we started with denial (Exxon's criminal suppression of its own research on the looming crisis #ExxonKnew).</p>
<p>From there, it was onto anger: slurs like "treehugger" and performative Drill-Baby-Drill-style incursions into protected lands.</p>
<p>But now we're into bargaining: can't we please keep the rapacious, immoral system that jeopardized our planet and species?</p>
<p>In other words: carbon offsets.</p>
<p>Rather than punishing firms and executives who sacrificed our planet and species for their short-term gains, we'll just give them a path to realizing even handsomer rewards for not murdering us all.</p>
<p>We decide how much carbon each country can emit, and then we let them trade those allotments between one another. If you forgo your carbon allowance – by not chopping down a forest, say – you get a credit that you can sell to a planet-destroying cruise-ship operator.</p>
<p>This is supposed to provide the incentives needed to get the market to reduce its own carbon footprint, by putting a price on carbon and then turning capitalism loose to reduce its obligation to pay that price with all the ingenuity that the human mind can muster.</p>
<p>"Incentives matter" is the rallying cry of the right. They're correct. And the incentive here is to reduce the amount paid for carbon by any means necessary, which is exactly what the market did.</p>
<p>To understand what happened next, consider a labor law that causes companies to pay fines for hurting their workers. Depending on how the fines are structured, they might incentivize employers to make their workplaces safer.</p>
<p>But there are other ways to respond. If the fine is low enough, it might be cheaper to maim workers than to upgrade your physical plant ("a fine is a price"). It might be cheaper to buy off the regulators and get the fines reduced.</p>
<p>It might be cheaper to hire Pinkertons to spy on maimed workers and find ways to discredit and smear them so the fines are nullified. Regulation works best in the presence of personal liability for corporate execs, steep fines, and weakened corporate power.</p>
<p>Carbon offsets have none of the above. What …</p></div></article></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>This post is also <a href="https://github.com/frankmcsherry/blog/blob/master/posts/2020-11-18.md">available at my personal blog</a>.</p>
<p>Materialize allows you to maintain declarative, relational SQL queries over continually changing data. One of the most powerful features of SQL queries are <em>joins</em>: the ability to correlate records from multiple collections of data. Joins also happen to be one of the harder things to do both correctly and efficiently as the underlying data change.</p>
<p>Let’s walk through the ways that Materialize maintains queries containing joins!</p>
<p>In particular, we’ll see increasingly sophisticated join planning techniques, starting from what a conventional dataflow system might do, and moving through joins that can introduce nearly zero per-query overhead. Each of the new join plans we work through represent an implementation strategy that Materialize can do that other dataflow systems will struggle to replicate.</p>
<p>As we move through techniques, the number of private intermediate records maintained by each query dataflows drops. We’ll report all 22 TPC-H queries at the end, but here are two of the largely representative queries, and the number of <em>additional</em> records Materialize maintains to keep the query results up to date.</p>
<pre><code>|   query 03 |  query 08 | technique         |
| ----------:|----------:|------------------ |
|  4,173,794 | 7,111,507 | Baseline          |
|  3,416,347 | 6,142,311 | Primary indexes   |
|    174,571 |   141,228 | Secondary indexes |
|     23,240 |         6 | Delta queries     |
</code></pre>
<p>Each of these techniques are live in <a href="https://materialize.com/download">Materialize</a> now. Each comes on-line in response to indexes that you ask Materialize to prepare. The more prepared indexes, the less per-query memory required (admittedly, the more baseline memory required as well).</p>
<p>At the end, we’ll have a forward-looking <a href="#Joins-in-Materialize:-Late-Materialization">discussion of late-materialization</a> which can further reduce the memory requirements, in a way that currently requires user assistance (we’re working on it!). Throughout, the story is that Materialize can invoke efficient join patterns from relational databases in the context of scale-out dataflow processors.</p>
<h2>Introducing Joins</h2>
<p>Let’s take a super-simple example of an “equi-join”:</p>
<pre><code>-- Collect customer names and states of residence.
SELECT
    customer.name,
    location.state
FROM
    customer,
    location
WHERE
    customer.zip = location.zip
</code></pre>
<p>Here  we have two collection of data, <code>customer</code> and <code>location</code>. We want to pick out pairs from each that match on their <code>zip</code> field. Although we didn’t write the word <code>JOIN</code>, that is what happens in SQL when you use multiple input collections.</p>
<p>Most dataflow systems will plan this join using a relatively simple dataflow graph:</p>
<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/frankmcsherry/blog/master/assets/joins/figure0.png" data-src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/frankmcsherry/blog/master/assets/joins/figure0.png" alt="" width="700"></p>
<p>Information about the <code>customer</code> and <code>location</code> collections flows in along their respective edges. For example, when records are added, removed, or updated, that information flows as data along an edge. The <code>join</code> operator receives this information, and must correctly respond to it with any changes to its output collection. For example, if we add a record to <code>customer</code>, the output must be updated to include any matches between that record and <code>location</code>; this probably means a new output record with the customer name and the state corresponding to its ZIP code.</p>
<p>Most dataflow systems implement the <code>join</code> operator by having it maintain its two inputs each in an index. As changes arrive for either input, the operator can look at their <code>zip</code> fields and immediately leap to the matching records in the <em>other</em> collection. This allows the operator to quickly respond to record additions, deletions, or changes with the corresponding output addition, deletion, or change.</p>
<p>The operator maintains state proportional to the current records in each of its inputs.</p>
<p>You may have noticed the  “most dataflow systems” refrain repeated above. Materialize will do things slightly differently, in a way that can be substantially better.</p>
<h2>Binary Joins in Materialize</h2>
<p>Materialize plans joins using a slightly different dataflow plan:</p>
<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/frankmcsherry/blog/master/assets/joins/figure1.png" data-src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/frankmcsherry/blog/master/assets/joins/figure1.png" alt="" width="700"></p>
<p>We have broken the traditional <code>join</code> operator into three parts. Each of the inputs first visits an <code>arrange</code> operator, whose results then go to a <code>join_core</code> operator. The <code>arrange</code> operators are in charge of <em>building and maintaining</em> the indexed representations of their inputs. The <code>join_core</code> operator takes two pre-indexed, maintained collections and applies the join <em>logic</em> to the changes that move through them.</p>
<p>Why break apart the <code>join</code> operator into <code>arrange</code> and <code>join_core</code>?</p>
<p>As you may know from relational databases, a small number of indexes can service a large volume of queries. The same is true in Materialize: we can re-use the indexed representations of collections across many independent joins. By separating the operator into 1. data organization and 2. computation, we can more easily slot in shared, re-used arrangements of data. This can result in a substantial reduction in the amount of memory required, as compared to traditional dataflow systems.</p>
<p>Let’s take the example above, using <code>customer</code> and <code>location</code>. The standard dataflow system will build <em>private</em> indexes of <code>customer</code> and <code>location</code>, each indexed by their <code>zip</code> field. The <code>zip</code> field in <code>location</code> may be a primary key, meaning each record has a different value of the field. Joins using primary keys are effectively “look-ups” and are quite common. Each such look-up would be a join using <code>location.zip</code> and would require the same index. We can build the index once, and re-use it across all of the query dataflows that need it.</p>
<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/frankmcsherry/blog/master/assets/joins/figure2.png" data-src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/frankmcsherry/blog/master/assets/joins/figure2.png" alt="" width="700"></p>
<p>We would still need a private copy of <code>customer</code> indexed by <code>zip</code>, but as we will see next there are standard clever idioms from databases that can make this efficient as well.</p>
<h2>Joins in Materialize: TPC-H examples</h2>
<p>Let’s work through a query from the TPC-H data warehousing benchmark.<br>
Query 03 is designed to match the following description:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  The Shipping Priority Query retrieves the shipping priority and potential revenue, defined as the sum of l_extendedprice * (1-l_discount), of the orders having the largest revenue among those that had not been shipped as of a given date. Orders are listed in decreasing order of revenue. If more than 10 unshipped orders exist, only the 10 orders with the largest revenue are listed.
</p></blockquote>
<p>The query itself is:</p>
<pre><code>SELECT
    l_orderkey,
    o_orderdate,
    o_shippriority,
    sum(l_extendedprice * (1 - l_discount)) AS revenue
FROM
    customer,
    orders,
    lineitem
WHERE
    c_mktsegment = 'BUILDING'
    AND c_custkey = o_custkey
    AND l_orderkey = o_orderkey
    AND o_orderdate &lt; DATE '1995-03-15'
    AND l_shipdate &gt; DATE '1995-03-15'
GROUP BY
    l_orderkey,
    o_orderdate,
    o_shippriority
ORDER BY
    revenue desc,
    o_orderdate;
</code></pre>
<p>The absence of <code>LIMIT 10</code> from the query is just how TPC-H defines things. In the interest of clarity we are going to work on the core of the query, without the <code>ORDER BY</code> or elided <code>LIMIT</code>. The query is a three-way join between <code>customer</code>, <code>orders</code>, and <code>lineitem</code>, followed by a reduction. The reduction keys seem to be three random fields, but notice that <code>l_orderkey = o_orderkey</code>, where <code>o_orderkey</code> is a primary key for <code>orders</code>; we are producing an aggregate for each order.</p>
<p>We’ll be using the scale-factor 1 dataset, as it what I have locally and it is good enough to call out some of the trade-offs. You can mentally multiply the numbers we’ll see by various powers of ten, and the same conclusions will hold.</p>
<h3>Joins in Materialize: A first implementation</h3>
<p>We can turn on <code>materialize</code> and frame the query above, using the <code>CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW ..</code> syntax. This instructs <code>materialize</code> to spin up a dataflow to read and maintain the results of the query. We can do this with no other preparation (other than creating the <code>customer</code>, <code>orders</code>, and <code>lineitem</code> data sources).</p>
<pre><code>materialize=&gt; CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW query_03 AS
materialize-&gt; SELECT
materialize-&gt;     l_orderkey,
materialize-&gt;     o_orderdate,
materialize-&gt;     o_shippriority,
materialize-&gt;     sum(l_extendedprice * (1 - l_discount)) AS revenue
materialize-&gt; FROM
materialize-&gt;     customer,
materialize-&gt;     orders,
materialize-&gt;     lineitem
materialize-&gt; WHERE
materialize-&gt;     c_mktsegment = 'BUILDING'
materialize-&gt;     AND c_custkey = o_custkey
materialize-&gt;     AND l_orderkey = o_orderkey
materialize-&gt;     AND o_orderdate &lt; DATE '1995-03-15'
materialize-&gt;     AND l_shipdate &gt; DATE '1995-03-15'
materialize-&gt; GROUP BY
materialize-&gt;     l_orderkey,
materialize-&gt;     o_orderdate,
materialize-&gt;     o_shippriority;
</code></pre>
<p>At this point, we should have efficient random access to the results. There are many results, so let’s just count them instead.</p>
<pre><code>materialize=&gt; select count(*) from query_03;
 count
-------
 11620
(1 row)

Time: 12.927 ms
materialize=&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>At the same time, maintaining this query comes with a cost. The dataflow that maintains <code>query_03</code> maintains several indexes over input and intermediate data. Here is a sketch of what the dataflow graph looks like for the query deployed against the raw data.</p>
<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/frankmcsherry/blog/master/assets/joins/tpch0.png" data-src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/frankmcsherry/blog/master/assets/joins/tpch0.png" alt="" width="700"></p>
<p>We can read out these volumes from <code>materialize</code>‘s logging views. To read out the total records maintained by each dataflow, we would type</p>
<pre><code>-- dataflow and number of records it is sitting on.
SELECT id, name, sum(records)
FROM mz_records_per_dataflow
GROUP BY id, name
ORDER BY sum(records) desc;
</code></pre>
<p>When we do, we see (truncated):</p>
<pre><code>      id  |                         name                          |   sum
    ------+-------------------------------------------------------+---------
--&gt;   490 | Dataflow: materialize.public.query_03_primary_idx     | 4173794
      ...
</code></pre>
<p>This tells us that our dataflow maintains some 4,173,794 records for the <code>query_03</code> dataflow. These are in support of maintaining the 11,620 results from that query, which may seem disproportionate. The explanation is that this dataflow needs to maintain each of its inputs, which are not otherwise stored within <code>materialize</code>. For example, the <code>lineitem</code> relation has six million records, and we need to maintain all relevant records (not all of them, as the filter on date removes roughly half of them).</p>
<p>However, there is a substantial cost to maintaining this query. …</p></div></div>

<p><a href="https://www.investopedia.com/articles/markets/030216/worlds-top-10-telecommunications-companies.asp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Telecom companies</a> have a lot of business and functional divisions that make them tick.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://www.kdnuggets.com/2019/02/top-10-data-science-use-cases-telecom.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Data scientists that work in telecom</a> can have various tasks to take care of depending on the division. There could be a data science team that improves customer experience, or one that powers the product &amp; engineering division.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In this article, we’ll look at popular use cases of data science and related tools in a telecom company, from my perspective as an ex-telecom data scientist.</p>






<h2>My typical day as a Data Scientist in telecom&nbsp;</h2>



<p>As a data scientist in the customer experience team, there are three main types of tasks that my role involved.&nbsp;</p>



<h3><strong>Business As Usual (BAU)</strong></h3>



<p>BAU is where you track certain KPIs, or tune/refresh an existing machine learning model.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Honestly, it’s the least interesting work for a passionate data scientist, since it involves very little innovation and plenty of redundant tasks.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But it’s a very important part of telecom companies, because it helps leadership and executives make better decisions and run the business efficiently.</p>



<h3><strong>Building Proof of Concept (POC)</strong></h3>



<p>Most new projects start with Proof of Concept. It’s quite common to assign a chunk of time block to work on building these POCs.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Unlike BAU, this work requires focus, research and development. It’s a more creative position, where the outcome of your work isn’t always positive.</p>



<h3><strong>Consulting&nbsp;</strong></h3>



<p>A lot of times, business stakeholders might come up with a business question, like “why is NPS (Net Promoter Score) going down?”.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>As a consulting data scientist (many data scientists hired for this role are evaluated on their consulting-type problem-solving capabilities), you have to translate that business question into a data science problem.&nbsp;</p>



<p>First, you might explore the factors that influence NPS. Is there any seasonality to it? Sometimes even if the NPS survey is not friendly, customers tend to give bad scores because they don’t like the survey. As you can see, these problems are nuanced and require data scientists to understand the nature of business, and even psychology.</p>



<p>Data scientists need to wear their consulting hat, and translate what their analysis tells them into valid, valuable conclusions for business stakeholders.</p>



<p>BAU, POC and Consulting are broad categories of data scientist tasks, but not the only ones. Some other types of tasks, which may overlap with the above three, are:</p>



<h3><strong>Meetings&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></h3>



<p>If you’re someone who has worked for a large corporation, you know that a huge amount of your time is spent in meetings.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If your team (like the one I was part of) works in an Agile methodology, then your calendar is going to be filled with a huge amount of sprint-related meetings. Daily Stand-ups, Sprint Closures, Sprint Retros, Sprint Planning, Backlog Grooming / Stories Prioritization.&nbsp;</p>



<p>These are just related to sprints. There are other types of internal meetings. Team Meetings, one-on-ones with managers, skip-level meetings and so on.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Whether you’re a software engineer or a data scientist, meetings are kind of the biggest curse of working for a big organization.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You need them because they provide the context for problems that you’re solving, but too many meetings can make you exhausted. The days when you have sprint planning or a team meeting, are the days you’re going to feel tired just from attending meetings.&nbsp;</p>



<h3><strong>Data Governance</strong></h3>



<p>When you’re dealing with data, the process starts from identifying what type of data you need, who owns that data (which business unit), where it’s stored, whether you need information security approval to access the data, who all people required to sign off, and so on.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There are a lot of questions that you might have to answer, and issues to overcome before you can even begin your project or POC. In a telecom company, data is the holy grail. It has to be treated with utmost care, otherwise you’re endangering not just your team, but even your entire company and its brand value.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There are tons of safeguards in place to avoid any catastrophe, and they can be a big hindrance in letting you start your project.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Sometimes, data science projects might get cancelled simply because someone couldn’t go through the process of data governance, or because the process has taken more time than the actual project would have taken.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You can’t start a project before you go through all the necessary data governance procedures.</p>






<h2>Data Science and Machine Learning use cases in telecom</h2>



<p>These use cases will be limited to the perspective of a customer experience data scientist. Most data science use cases in a corporation would revolve around the team’s business KPIs.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Typically, the data science team would be tasked with either improving those KPIs, or preventing their downfall.</p>



<p>For a customer experience (CX) team, example KPIs could be:</p>



<ul><li>Customer Churn,</li><li>Active Users – DAU, WAU, MAU (Daily, Weekly &amp; Monthly Active Users),</li><li>NPS – Net Promoter Score,</li><li>CSAT – Customer Satisfaction Score.</li></ul>



<p>The use cases based on these KPIs would be:</p>



<ul><li>Customer churn prediction,</li><li>Identifying factors driving or influencing customer churn,</li><li>Customer churn cost estimation,</li><li>Increasing DAU, WAU, MAU (user retention &amp; activity),&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>Predicting NPS for a given customer case,&nbsp;</li><li>Identifying factors driving or influencing NPS,&nbsp;</li><li>Customer feedback insights from NPS &amp; CSAT survey feedback,&nbsp;</li><li>Sentiment analysis from NPS feedback,&nbsp;</li><li>Building customer 360 intelligence (mostly for B2B accounts),&nbsp;</li><li>Recommendation engine for upselling and cross-selling.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>How are these use cases handled? First of all, it starts with an idea pitch. Let’s say, “recommendation engine” is our idea, and we’re pitching it to the relevant stakeholder – Head of CX or Customer Retention.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Next, we’d have some questions to answer during the pitching session. If the stakeholder is convinced by the pitch, the idea moves on to the POC stage.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Proof of Concept stage is where we get to build a tiny prototype, using a small sample of real data. This is very similar to the MVP process in product companies.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The POC success is going to be measured based on a lot of factors (usually those success metrics are defined during the idea pitching stage). If “recommendation engine” is the idea, then the success metrics could be:</p>



<ul><li>How much upselling this can generate?&nbsp;</li><li>How much customer wallet share this recommendation engine can help capture?</li><li>Does it also avoid customer churn?</li><li>Would it improve customer retention?&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>All these questions are usually answered both qualitatively and quantitatively, with actual numbers (for the small subset of sample data). If the project sponsor or business stakeholder/team believes that the POC is a success, then the project moves on to the production stage.</p>



<p>Moving a data science project from the POC/prototype stage to production generates new challenges.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Until now, it was just concerning the data science team and its respective business team. When it’s moving to production, it’s an entirely new ballgame. It goes like this:</p>



<ul><li>optimizing our existing code,&nbsp;</li><li>following engineering/development team’s coding standards,&nbsp;</li><li>quality assurance of the code and the machine learning model,&nbsp;</li><li>ensuring dependencies,&nbsp;</li><li>setting up CI/CD pipelines for future updates,&nbsp;</li><li>deciding on the design of how to provide inference – micro service, API or a web app.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>This requires the involvement of a lot more teams: IT, DevOps, Engineering. There’s a lot more project management procedures involved.&nbsp;</p>



<p>An important thing to note at this point is that at the POC stage, we present a deadline of when this project might go live. It’s important to take all the necessary stages between POC and production when computing the deadline.</p>






<h2>Data Science tools, libraries, and frameworks used in telecom</h2>



<p>It’s common to see different sets of tools used to solve the same type of problems in large organizations.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Take data visualization as an example. You might see the data science team (handling visualization) using Tableau for one project, and Qlik Sense for another project, while at the same time some team members might be building a new dashboard with R Shiny or Python Plotly Dash.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Bottomline – one problem, multiple tools. Also, because the telecom industry is usually capital-heavy, they don’t shy away from investing in expensive proprietary tools.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Let’s take a look at some of the tools used in the customer experience data science team of a telecom company.&nbsp;</p>



<h3><strong>Data infrastructure&nbsp;</strong></h3>



<p>Data infrastructure is something that’s often ignored and not talked about much while discussing data science teams. It’s blasphemous not to recognize the amount of work that the data engineering team puts together to make data and computational platforms available for the data science team.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Unlike many modern tech companies, a telecom company doesn’t have the luxury of adopting cloud solutions due to a lot of security and compliance measures.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Along with regulatory requirements, this makes it very difficult to use cutting edge computational platforms. Technologies like Teradata, SAS, that are considered old-school &amp; expensive, are still powering such telecom data science teams.&nbsp;</p>



<p>What if you need a powerful machine? Well, you’ll probably have a powerful remote server available through VDI or Citrix (Virtualization). That comes with its own challenges of security and data location.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Even if you’ve got a powerful local computer/laptop, there are tons of restrictions:</p>



<ul><li>VPN,&nbsp;</li><li>Inability to download customer data on a local machine,&nbsp;</li><li>Need to anonymise PII,</li></ul>



<p>and many more complications that you need to overcome. All in all, data in a telecom company is a very difficult thing to work with. It’s not necessarily about data complexity, rather about security, compliance, data source, storage, computational limitations and so on.&nbsp;</p>

December 14, 2020 | https://blog.djy.io/alda-and-the-nrepl-protocol/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://blog.djy.io/alda-and-the-nrepl-protocol/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
<p>As you may have heard, I have been busy, working on Alda v2, a ground-up rewrite
of <a href="https://alda.io/">Alda</a> using Go and Kotlin. As part of this project, I have
re-thought the Alda REPL experience to make it closer in spirit to the
<a href="https://nrepl.org/">nREPL</a> experience that I’ve been enjoying as a Clojure programmer.</p>

<p>The big idea about nREPL is that it is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read%E2%80%93eval%E2%80%93print_loop">REPL</a> that operates over a
network connection. After starting an nREPL <strong>server</strong>, any number of nREPL
<strong>clients</strong> can connect to the server and send over code to be evaluated. The
server treats each client connection as a separate context, and sends evaluation
results back to the client in response.</p>

<p>As I was designing the next major version of Alda, I came to the conclusion that
the Alda REPL should function in the same way. The exciting idea that I have in
mind is that multiple Alda composers could connect to the same Alda REPL server
and compose music together by interacting with the server in real time.</p>

<p>So, I started thinking about the protocol for these interactions between REPL
clients and REPL servers. I had read that nREPL is a language-agnostic protocol
(i.e. not specific to Clojure) and that it has been used to successfully
implement <a href="https://nrepl.org/nrepl/0.8/beyond_clojure.html">nREPL servers for other languages</a>. So, I
decided to try my hand at using the nREPL protocol as the basis for a new,
improved Alda v2 REPL experience.</p>



<p>The current version of Alda (v1) actually has a client/server architecture
already. To start the server, you run <code>alda up</code>, and to start a REPL client
session, you run <code>alda repl</code>.</p>

<p>I realized, however, that the Alda v1 client/server idea extends a little too
far into user-land. The end user is forced to worry about whether or not a
server is running, even outside of the context of a REPL session when they just
want to perform basic evaluations at the command line.</p>

<p>For example, if you don’t have a server running, any attempt to play an Alda
score from the command line will fail:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="text">$ alda play -c 'cello: o2 a'
# ... after an awkward pause ...
[27713] ERROR Alda server is down. To start the server, run `alda up`.</code></pre></figure>

<p>I have often wished that Alda had a better out-of-the-box experience. Alda does
need to start background processes to play your score in an asynchronous manner,
but it would be nice if Alda could start these background processes <em>for</em> me,
instead of expecting me to run <code>alda up</code> and wait for the server to come up
before I can do anything. It would also be nice if Alda could do more of the
work that it does without needing to talk to a server at all. For example, the
<code>alda</code> CLI should be able to tell me if my score has a syntax error without
needing to talk to a background process.</p>

<p>So, I’ve implemented it that way for Alda v2, and now I feel like the basic,
everyday usage of the Alda CLI is much more comfortable and satisfying! When
Alda v2 is released, users will no longer need to know about Alda’s background
processes at all. After downloading and installing Alda, users can run <code>alda
play -c 'some code'</code> or <code>alda play -f some-file.alda</code> whenever the inspiration
strikes them and Alda will play their score, even though they never ran <code>alda
up</code> (a command that no longer exists in Alda v2). There are still background
processes out of necessity (an important goal of Alda is that playback is
asynchronous), but now, the processes are entirely managed “behind the scenes”
by Alda.</p>



<p>Whereas the Alda v1 REPL requires you to start an Alda server first (<code>alda up</code>),
the Alda v2 REPL automatically starts a REPL server for you when you run <code>alda
repl</code>. The interactive REPL session feels a lot like the command line <code>alda play
-c '...'</code> experience, except that the REPL remembers the context of your
previous evaluations. For example, if you evaluate the following line of code:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="text">accordion: o5 c d e f</code></pre></figure>

<p>You will hear an accordion playing the notes C, D, E, and F in the fifth octave.
Then, if you evaluate the following line of code:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="text">g</code></pre></figure>

<p>You will hear the note G, still on an accordion, still in the fifth octave.</p>

<p>The Alda v2 REPL loads instantaneously, and you can immediately start entering
lines of input into your REPL session after you run <code>alda repl</code>. It doesn’t
<em>feel</em> like a client/server setup, but under the hood, it is.</p>

<p>It might not look like much now, but this improved client/server REPL
architecture will unlock new and exciting possibilities for Alda composers to
collaborate in real time.</p>

<p>Imagine a scenario where one composer is sharing their system’s audio with
others. Maybe they are performing live on a stage, and their audio is being
projected over a sound system. Maybe it’s a virtual event with an audience.  Or
maybe it’s just a small group of friends on a Zoom call. In any of these
scenarios, the composer who’s sharing their audio can start an Alda REPL server
(<code>alda repl --server --port 12345</code>) and the other composers can participate by
connecting to the REPL server (<code>alda repl --client --host 1.2.3.4 --port
12345</code>). Now, all of the composers have access to the same audio programming
environment, and they can interact with the same score, writing their own
contributions and hearing them played together.</p>

<p>Just talking about this is giving me goosebumps! I hope that someday, I can make
this dream of live, collaborative Alda programming a reality. But for now, I’d
like to talk a little more about the nREPL protocol and the fun that I had
implementing it for Alda v2.</p>



<h2 id="messages-and-transport">Messages and transport</h2>

<p>nREPL messages are typically sent <a href="https://wiki.theory.org/index.php/BitTorrentSpecification#Bencoding">bencoded</a> over sockets. Bencode is a
simple encoding format developed by BitTorrent with existing library support in
a number of languages. I tried several bencode libraries for Go, and I ended up
choosing <a href="https://github.com/jackpal/bencode-go">this one</a> because it has a simple, intuitive API and it
worked out of the box.</p>

<p>Every nREPL message represents either a request from a client or a response from
a server. In either case, the message is an associative data structure (think
Clojure maps, Ruby hashes, Go maps, JSON objects, etc.). Every request message
contains at least an operation (<code>op</code>), and often other entries whose names vary
depending on the operation.</p>

<p>Here’s an example request from a client to evaluate a string of code:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="json"><span>{</span><span>
  </span><span>"op"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"eval"</span><span>,</span><span>
  </span><span>"code"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"(+ 1 2 3)"</span><span>
</span><span>}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Strictly speaking, this is all that’s required in a request. However, there are
a couple of other things that it is standard for a client request to include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><code>id</code>: a unique identifier (e.g. a UUID) representing the request. The server
parrots the <code>id</code> value back in the response so that the client can be sure
that the response it’s supposed to receive wasn’t mixed up with the response
for another request.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>session</code>: another unique identifier that represents the <em>session</em> that the
client and server are currently participating in. I’ll talk more about
sessions below.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Response messages also include <code>id</code> and <code>session</code> entries, and they also may
include a <code>status</code> entry, which is actually a <em>list</em> of strings that describe
the status of the request. If a request was handled successfully, the status
will be <code>["done"]</code>. If there was an error, the status will be <code>["done",
"error"]</code>. If a response is missing status information altogether, it means that
the request is still being processed, and the client should continue to receive
responses from the server until it receives one where the <code>status</code> entry
includes <code>"done"</code>.</p>

<p>Here’s an example response from a server with an evaluation result:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="json"><span>{</span><span>
  </span><span>"id"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"d2fa0626-58a3-4abc-b0af-a8afd8b818ad"</span><span>,</span><span>
  </span><span>"session"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"bb05e357-d9c0-49d2-b206-067c88913e68"</span><span>,</span><span>
  </span><span>"status"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>[</span><span>"done"</span><span>],</span><span>
  </span><span>"value"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"6"</span><span>
</span><span>}</span></code></pre></figure>

<h2 id="clientserver-interactions">Client/server interactions</h2>

<p>The official nREPL documentation about <a href="https://nrepl.org/nrepl/0.8/building_servers.html">building servers</a> and
<a href="https://nrepl.org/nrepl/0.8/building_clients.html">building clients</a> is concise and super informative. I was
basically able to read and implement all of it over the course of a few days,
and I had a lot of fun doing it!</p>

<p>When an nREPL client starts, it first sends a <code>clone</code> request to the server to
create a new session:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="json"><span>{</span><span>
  </span><span>"id"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"dc0a4fb1-0a30-483c-8384-de166cb9bf4d"</span><span>,</span><span>
  </span><span>"op"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"clone"</span><span>
</span><span>}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>The server sends a response that indicates the session was created successfully
and includes the ID of the new session:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="json"><span>{</span><span>
  </span><span>"id"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"dc0a4fb1-0a30-483c-8384-de166cb9bf4d"</span><span>,</span><span>
  </span><span>"new-session"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"b08f4313-7f8a-46a0-8a40-5b8424681dbf"</span><span>,</span><span>
  </span><span>"status"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>[</span><span>"done"</span><span>]</span><span>
</span><span>}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Next, the client sends a <code>describe</code> request to verify that the server supports
all of the operations it needs to perform:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="json"><span>{</span><span>
  </span><span>"id"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"0014c5ec-69bd-4fa1-ad78-1aabde04cc4f"</span><span>,</span><span>
  </span><span>"op"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"describe"</span><span>,</span><span>
  </span><span>"session"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"b08f4313-7f8a-46a0-8a40-5b8424681dbf"</span><span>
</span><span>}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>The server responds with information about what operations it can perform, as
well as what versions of things (e.g. Alda) it is running:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="json"><span>{</span><span>
  </span><span>"id"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"0014c5ec-69bd-4fa1-ad78-1aabde04cc4f"</span><span>,</span><span>
  </span><span>"ops"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>
    </span><span>"clone"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>{},</span><span>
    </span><span>"describe"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>{},</span><span>
    </span><span>"eval"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>{},</span><span>
    </span><span>"eval-and-play"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>{},</span><span>
    </span><span>"export"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>{},</span><span>
    </span><span>"instruments"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>{},</span><span>
    </span><span>"load"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>{},</span><span>
    </span><span>"new-score"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>{},</span><span>
    </span><span>"replay"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>{},</span><span>
    </span><span>"score-data"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>{},</span><span>
    </span><span>"score-events"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>{},</span><span>
    </span><span>"score-text"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>{},</span><span>
    </span><span>"stop"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>{}</span><span>
  </span><span>},</span><span>
  </span><span>"session"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"b08f4313-7f8a-46a0-8a40-5b8424681dbf"</span><span>,</span><span>
  </span><span>"status"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>[</span><span>"done"</span><span>],</span><span>
  </span><span>"versions"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>
    </span><span>"alda"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>
      </span><span>"version-string"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"1.99.2"</span><span>
    </span><span>}</span><span>
  </span><span>}</span><span>
</span><span>}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>This is useful because it means the client can fail gracefully if it
inadvertently connects to an nREPL server that can’t perform the operations that
the client needs. In particular, <code>eval-and-play</code> is an operation that I
implemented for the Alda nREPL server, but a different kind of nREPL server
(like a Clojure nREPL server) would not support that operation, so the Alda
client can easily detect that situation and let the user know.</p>

<h2 id="trying-it-out">Trying it out</h2>

<p>The most fun part was that I was able to test my implementations of the Alda
nREPL client and server by pointing them at a Clojure nREPL server and client.
This taught me a lot about what an nREPL client or server written “to spec”
should do.</p>

<p>The cool thing is that I was able to make my Alda nREPL server functional enough
to participate in a Clojure nREPL client session. The Alda nREPL server doesn’t
really support <code>eval</code> (at least, not yet?), so it just responds with a shrug
emoji, but it’s still fun to see the communication …</p></article></div>

<p>by Gianni Tedesco</p>

<p>Some pythonistas wonder what is the fastest way to write a function to
partition a sequence of items in to two lists based on some predicate. One
could, to be sure, <code>filter</code> the list and then <code>filterfalse</code> the list. But in
this case the predicate will evaluated twice for each item - an inefficiency
that some would balk at. That approach also doesn’t seem very parsimonious.</p>

<p>This problem has inspired several broad classes of solutions based on different
needs and priorities and some very minor controversy about which is the most
efficient. I hope to clear up the question of efficiency by introducing a new
variant here today.</p>


<p>Have you ever found yourself doing something like this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>foos</span> <span>=</span> <span>[</span><span>x</span> <span>for</span> <span>x</span> <span>in</span> <span>input</span> <span>if</span> <span>x</span><span>.</span><span>type</span> <span>in</span> <span>known_foos</span><span>]</span>
<span>bars</span> <span>=</span> <span>[</span><span>x</span> <span>for</span> <span>x</span> <span>in</span> <span>input</span> <span>if</span> <span>x</span><span>.</span><span>type</span> <span>not</span> <span>in</span> <span>known_foos</span><span>]</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>It’s a DRY itch. Quite irritating. It calls for a salve. Surely Python would
have a solution for this? It has an expansive standard library…</p>


<p>The suggestion in the <code>itertools</code> documentation is to use <code>tee</code> in an elegant
way, along with <code>filter</code> and <code>filterfalse</code>, which are also both in the standard
libraries. This approach also has the benefit of working with arbitrary
generators. It can even, in principle, handle an infinitely long input
sequence.</p>

<p>It’s quite clever, so it’s worth mentioning.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>from</span> <span>itertools</span> <span>import</span> <span>tee</span><span>,</span> <span>filterfalse</span>

<span>def</span> <span>stdlib</span><span>(</span><span>pred</span><span>,</span> <span>it</span><span>):</span>
    <span>a</span><span>,</span> <span>b</span> <span>=</span> <span>tee</span><span>(</span><span>it</span><span>)</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>filterfalse</span><span>(</span><span>pred</span><span>,</span> <span>a</span><span>),</span> <span>filter</span><span>(</span><span>pred</span><span>,</span> <span>b</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>But the problem is that it’s also quite slow when you’re just going to be
materialising the results immediately. To see why, imagine calling it:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>hay</span><span>,</span> <span>needles</span> <span>=</span> <span>partition</span><span>(</span><span>lambda</span> <span>item</span><span>:</span> <span>item</span> <span>in</span> <span>needle_set</span><span>,</span> <span>haystack</span><span>)</span>
<span>return</span> <span>Results</span><span>(</span><span>list</span><span>(</span><span>hay</span><span>),</span> <span>list</span><span>(</span><span>needles</span><span>))</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>As soon as we materialise one of the returned generators, tee will internally
materialise haystack in to a temporary list. And the predicates are still being evaluated twice, once for each fork of the <code>tee</code>.</p>

<p>But I can see this sort of thing being useful in a graph of <code>asyncio</code> tasks or
something. Maybe one day I will find myself in a situation where I would need
to use a cool technique like this.</p>


<p>But let’s forget about possibly-infinite generators and lazy evaluation and
just consider the case of a list that we want to partition in to two new lists.</p>

<p>For that case case, I’ve seen a couple of clever approaches.</p>

<p>The first one is quite quick to type and nice and readable. It involves using
the result of the predicate function to index in to the results tuple. It takes
advantage of the fact that <code>True</code> and <code>False</code> cast to <code>1</code> and <code>0</code> when used to
index a tuple.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>def</span> <span>trevor</span><span>(</span><span>pred</span><span>,</span> <span>it</span><span>):</span>
    <span>ret</span> <span>=</span> <span>([],</span> <span>[])</span>
    <span>for</span> <span>item</span> <span>in</span> <span>it</span><span>:</span>
        <span>ret</span><span>[</span><span>pred</span><span>(</span><span>item</span><span>)].</span><span>append</span><span>(</span><span>item</span><span>)</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>ret</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Honestly, this probably would have been my go-to approach, but it actually
turns out to be quite slow.</p>

<p>The second is a very functional-style solution, straight out of some sort of
Haskellers PhD thesis, proposed by stackoverflow member Mariy. This one uses
<code>functools.reduce</code>, which is pythons version of <code>foldl</code>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>def</span> <span>mariy</span><span>(</span><span>pred</span><span>,</span> <span>it</span><span>):</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>reduce</span><span>(</span><span>lambda</span> <span>x</span><span>,</span> <span>y</span><span>:</span> <span>x</span><span>[</span><span>pred</span><span>(</span><span>y</span><span>)].</span><span>append</span><span>(</span><span>y</span><span>)</span> <span>or</span> <span>x</span><span>,</span> <span>it</span><span>,</span> <span>([],</span> <span>[]))</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>In princple, this is the same as the above but it takes advantage of the fact
that reduce performs some of the boilerplate for you.</p>

<p>I expect it to be a bit less efficient since it creates as many result tuples
as there are elements in the input list. Repetetive object creation and
destruction is a common source of overhead in python.</p>


<p>According to gboffi, it turns out the fastest solution that
<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4578590/python-equivalent-of-filter-getting-two-output-lists-i-e-partition-of-a-list/52822805#52822805">stackoverflow</a>
came up with is just the straight forward version, credited to Mark Byers:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>def</span> <span>byers</span><span>(</span><span>pred</span><span>,</span> <span>it</span><span>):</span>
    <span>ts</span> <span>=</span> <span>[]</span>
    <span>fs</span> <span>=</span> <span>[]</span>
    <span>for</span> <span>item</span> <span>in</span> <span>it</span><span>:</span>
        <span>if</span> <span>pred</span><span>(</span><span>item</span><span>):</span>
            <span>ts</span><span>.</span><span>append</span><span>(</span><span>item</span><span>)</span>
        <span>else</span><span>:</span>
            <span>fs</span><span>.</span><span>append</span><span>(</span><span>item</span><span>)</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>fs</span><span>,</span> <span>ts</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>But, knowing something about optimizing python code, I can see a clear
opportunity to speed this up.</p>


<p>We can disassemble this to python bytecode with <code>dis</code>. Generally speaking, the
main determinant of performance in these kind of loops is the number of
bytecode instructions which need to be dispatched per iteration.</p>

<p>So here is what the Byers version compiles to in cpython 3.9:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>  2           0 BUILD_LIST               0
              2 STORE_FAST               2 (ts)

  3           4 BUILD_LIST               0
              6 STORE_FAST               3 (fs)

  4           8 LOAD_FAST                1 (it)
             10 GET_ITER
        &gt;&gt;   12 FOR_ITER                34 (to 48)
             14 STORE_FAST               4 (item)

  5          16 LOAD_FAST                0 (pred)
             18 LOAD_FAST                4 (item)
             20 CALL_FUNCTION            1
             22 POP_JUMP_IF_FALSE       36

  6          24 LOAD_FAST                2 (ts)
             26 LOAD_METHOD              0 (append)
             28 LOAD_FAST                4 (item)
             30 CALL_METHOD              1
             32 POP_TOP
             34 JUMP_ABSOLUTE           12

  8     &gt;&gt;   36 LOAD_FAST                1 (fs)
             38 LOAD_METHOD              0 (append)
             40 LOAD_FAST                4 (item)
             42 CALL_METHOD              1
             44 POP_TOP
             46 JUMP_ABSOLUTE           12

  9     &gt;&gt;   48 LOAD_FAST                3 (fs)
             50 LOAD_FAST                2 (ts)
             52 BUILD_TUPLE              2
             54 RETURN_VALUE
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The inner loop is between locations 12 and 46. It’s 18 instructions long.</p>

<p>We can see that the append code has some duplicated instructions in each branch
(24-34, and 36-46), but since only one branch is taken at a time, that
shouldn’t really be counted.</p>

<p>So if we measure the actual instruction path-length per iteration, it comes out
to 12 instructions.</p>

<p>More importantly, we can see that inside that inner loop we’re doing a lookup
of the <code>append</code> method, which is actually looking up a string in a dictionary.
For this reason, the <code>LOAD_GLOBAL</code> and <code>LOAD_METHOD</code> calls are among the
slowest of the basic instruction types in the python machine (not including the
instructions which call out to python subroutines, of course).</p>


<p>We have probably all heard that python is a dynamic language. But we may not
know what all of the consequences of that fact are. For one thing, it means
that attribute lookups are often expensive dictionary lookups. But it also
means that even some very obvious optimisations <em>simply cannot be made</em>. For
example, the python compiler cannot, in general, optimise:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span># Program A
</span><span>x</span> <span>=</span> <span>[]</span>
<span>for</span> <span>a</span> <span>in</span> <span>b</span><span>:</span>
    <span>x</span><span>.</span><span>append</span><span>(</span><span>a</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>in to:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span># Program B
</span><span>x</span> <span>=</span> <span>[]</span>
<span>f</span> <span>=</span> <span>x</span><span>.</span><span>append</span>
<span>for</span> <span>a</span> <span>in</span> <span>b</span><span>:</span>
    <span>f</span><span>(</span><span>a</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The reason for this is that the method <code>list.append</code> is absolutely free to
assign a different value to <code>self.append</code>. This means that programs A and B are
(or at least, may be) semantically different. Therefore B is not a valid
optimization of A.</p>

<p>Now you might think that, well, the bytecode compiler can know about the
implementation of <code>list.append</code> because it’s built-in. Which is true. But it
doesn’t stop any other code, for example in <code>b.__iter__.next()</code> from obtaining
a reference to <code>x</code> via any number of mechanisms and then altering its attribute
dict.</p>

<p>You wouldn’t even have to resort to reflection - the local variable <code>x</code> could
just be a reference to an object which is also reachable in a global scope. And
what variables there are in the global scope can be modified on the fly by any
code so it wouldn’t be enough to do an
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escape_analysis">escape-analysis</a> at compile
time.</p>

<p>Frankly there are just too many avenues in python for this sort of
jiggery-pokery to take place. And these avenues are kind of the point of
python.</p>


<p>OK, that’s interesting, but what if we just explicitly apply the above
optimisation?</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>def</span> <span>scara</span><span>(</span><span>pred</span><span>,</span> <span>it</span><span>):</span>
    <span>ts</span> <span>=</span> <span>[]</span>
    <span>fs</span> <span>=</span> <span>[]</span>
    <span>t</span> <span>=</span> <span>ts</span><span>.</span><span>append</span>
    <span>f</span> <span>=</span> <span>fs</span><span>.</span><span>append</span>
    <span>for</span> <span>item</span> <span>in</span> <span>it</span><span>:</span>
        <span>if</span> <span>pred</span><span>(</span><span>item</span><span>):</span>
            <span>t</span><span>(</span><span>item</span><span>)</span>
        <span>else</span><span>:</span>
            <span>f</span><span>(</span><span>item</span><span>)</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>fs</span><span>,</span> <span>ts</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>You can see from the bytecode that this has reduced the instruction path-length
as we expected:</p>
<div><div><pre><code> 28           0 BUILD_LIST               0

             34 POP_JUMP_IF_FALSE       46

             62 RETURN_VALUE
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The inner loop takes place between locations 24 and 48. It’s 16 instructions
long. And if we look at the instruction path length for the loop, it’s now 11
instructions long. One shorter than before. Of course, it’s that missing
<code>LOAD_ATTR</code> instruction which has been hoisted out of the loop in to the
function preamble.</p>


<p>I couldn’t figure out a way to get the inner loop any tighter but I did find a
way to make the code more compact by removing duplicated code on both sides of
the branch. It led to a tiny improvement in performance. Here it is:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>def</span> <span>scara2</span><span>(</span><span>pred</span><span>,</span> <span>it</span><span>):</span>

<p><em>Adi Shamir’s Secret Sharing</em> is a cryptographic algorithm that allows distinct parties to jointly share ownership of a single secret by holding <em>shares</em>. The original secret can only be reconstructed by using a minimum number of shares, which allows different parties to cooperate without the need to fully trust one another.</p>
<h2>Example Problem</h2>
<p>To illustrate, let’s imagine that a family of four all share a single Bitcoin wallet. This Bitcoin wallet contains a single private key that all members of the family co-own. Because there is a single key, any of the family members can use that key to spend all of the Bitcoins. </p>
<p>The family has a problem: If they each keep a copy, then only one of their copies needs to be compromised to have all the coins stolen. If only one of them keeps the key, then that person may lose it or decide to double-cross the other family members.</p>
<p>Luckily, one of the family members is also a cryptographer. Instead of naively sharing the original key, they use SSS (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shamir%27s_Secret_Sharing" target="_blank" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Shamir’s secret sharing</a>). The family creates four shares and sets a threshold of three, with the Bitcoin key as the original secret. Now, their plan has the following properties:</p>
<ul><li>They have not stored the bitcoin key in a single place which makes it harder to steal</li><li>Members of the family need to cooperate to spend the Bitcoin, one family member can’t betray the others</li><li>If a family member dies or loses their share, the other three members can still reconstruct the key</li></ul>
<h2>Understanding the Threshold</h2>
<p>Every Shamir sharing scheme has a total number of shares and a threshold. The <strong>threshold is the number of shares required</strong> to reconstruct the original secret. For example, with five shares and a threshold of three, you only need three of the five shares to calculate the original secret.</p>
<h2>The Math – Lines</h2>
<p>One of the fundamental mathematical properties used in Shamir’s secret sharing is the fact that it takes <em>k</em> points to define a polynomial of degree <em>k </em>– 1. For example:</p>
<ul><li>Only one line can be drawn between two points</li><li>Only one possible parabola crosses through the same three points</li><li>Only one cubic curve passes through the same four points</li><li>An infinite number of lines can be drawn through the same point</li><li>An infinite number of parabolas can be drawn through the same two points</li></ul>
<h2>The Math – Walkthrough</h2>
<p>Let us construct a scheme to share our secret 1954 (<em>S)</em> with 4 (<em>n)</em> shares and a threshold of 3 (<em>k)</em>.</p>
<p>First, we randomly choose <em>k</em> – 1 positive integers, so in our case, 2 positive integers. We randomly choose 43 and 12.</p>
<p>Then, we build a polynomial of the form</p>
<pre><code lang="bash">y = a0 + a1*x + a2*x^2</code></pre>
<p>Where a0 is the secret, and a1 and a2 are our randomly chosen integers. We are left with:</p>
<pre><code lang="bash">y = 1954 + 43x + 12x^2</code></pre>
<p>Then, we use this formula to create 4 points (shares) that we give to each participant.</p>
<h3><span>Share 1</span></h3>
<p>(x, y) where x = 1</p>
<p>y = 1954 + 43*1 + 12*1^2 = 2009</p>
<p>(1, 2009)</p>
<h3><span>Share 2</span></h3>
<p>(x, y) where x = 2</p>
<p>y = 1954 + 43*2 + 12*2^2 = 2088</p>
<p>(2, 2088)</p>
<h3><span>Share 3</span> </h3>
<p>(x, y) where x = 3</p>
<p>y = 1954 + 43*3 + 12*3^2 = 2191</p>
<p>(3, 2191)</p>
<h3><span>Share 4</span></h3>
<p>(x, y) where x = 4</p>
<p>y = 1954 + 43*4 + 12*4^2 = 2318</p>
<p>(4, 2318)</p>
<h2>Reconstruction</h2>
<p>Each participant in our scheme now owns one <code>(x,y)</code> point, which is a single share. Remember that we set our threshold to 3 and that 3 points define a parabola (polynomial of degree 2) perfectly. That means that if we use three points, we can draw a parabola and calculate a0 (the secret). Let’s assume we have control of shares 1, 2, and 4.</p>
<h3>Step 1 – Plot the points (shares) that we control</h3>
<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="498" src="https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/shamirs-secret-sharing-no-line-1024x498.jpg" alt="shamirs secret sharing no line" srcset="https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/shamirs-secret-sharing-no-line-1024x498.jpg 1024w, https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/shamirs-secret-sharing-no-line-300x146.jpg 300w, https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/shamirs-secret-sharing-no-line-768x374.jpg 768w, https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/shamirs-secret-sharing-no-line-1536x747.jpg 1536w, https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/shamirs-secret-sharing-no-line-150x73.jpg 150w, https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/shamirs-secret-sharing-no-line.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="shamirs secret sharing no line"></figure></div>
<h3>Step 2 – Draw the corresponding parabola </h3>
<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="540" src="https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/shamirs-secret-sharing-1024x540.jpg" alt="shamirs secret sharing" srcset="https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/shamirs-secret-sharing-1024x540.jpg 1024w, https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/shamirs-secret-sharing-300x158.jpg 300w, https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/shamirs-secret-sharing-768x405.jpg 768w, https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/shamirs-secret-sharing-1536x810.jpg 1536w, https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/shamirs-secret-sharing-150x79.jpg 150w, https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/shamirs-secret-sharing.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="shamirs secret sharing"></figure></div>
<h3>Step 3 – Find the point where <code>x=0</code>. It’s <code>y</code> value is the secret</h3>
<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="555" src="https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/shamirs-secret-sharing-shares-1024x555.jpg" alt="shamirs secret sharing shares" srcset="https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/shamirs-secret-sharing-shares-1024x555.jpg 1024w, https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/shamirs-secret-sharing-shares-300x162.jpg 300w, https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/shamirs-secret-sharing-shares-768x416.jpg 768w, https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/shamirs-secret-sharing-shares-1536x832.jpg 1536w, https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/shamirs-secret-sharing-shares-150x81.jpg 150w, https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/shamirs-secret-sharing-shares.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="shamirs secret sharing shares"></figure></div>
<p>In our case, the secret is <code>1954</code>.</p>
<h2>It’s not actually that simple. We need finite fields.</h2>
<p>While the example we worked through above is great for demonstration purposes, it actually isn’t very secure. For each share that an attacker obtains, they actually are gaining more and more information about the secret. While two points don’t perfectly describe a parabola, they still leak critical information <em>about</em> the parabola.</p>
<p>The solution lies in <a aria-label="finite field arithmetic (opens in a new tab)" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_field_arithmetic" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">finite field arithmetic</a>. By plotting the function on a finite field of sufficient size, the graph of the polynomial becomes disjointed and scattered, which means the attacker is unable to make educated guesses about the pathing of the underlying function.</p>
<h2>Adi Shamir</h2>
<p>Adi Shamir is an Israeli cryptographer famous for Shamir’s Secret Sharing, but he is also a co-inventor of the widely used RSA algorithm that the vast majority of the internet is built upon. Shamir was born in&nbsp;Tel Aviv and earned an undergraduate degree<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bachelor_of_Science" rel="noopener"> </a>in&nbsp;math&nbsp;from the university there. Later he obtained his master’s and Ph.D. degrees in&nbsp;Computer Science&nbsp;from the&nbsp;Weizmann Institute&nbsp;in 1975 and 1977 respectively.</p>

    <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>Hypervisor Memory Introspection, as its name implies, relies heavily an analyzing guest memory contents in order to infer details about the OS structures or to analyze the behavior of the kernel and applications. This works perfectly as long as only physical memory or resident virtual memory is analyzed (for example, guest page-tables, or non-paged kernel memory). Many times, however, regions of the Windows kernel memory or regions belonging to user-mode processes will not be mapped in physical memory, thus preventing HVMI from analyzing their contents. In this blog post, we will describe how we deal with swapped-out guest memory, in order to ensure HVMI will get a chance to analyze the contents of a memory page even if it is not resident in physical memory: meet the page-fault injection mechanism!</p>

<h2 id="paging-overview">Paging Overview</h2>

<p>On x86, there are several resources that control virtual to physical address translation. The first stage of a virtual address translation is <strong>segmentation</strong>. During this step, the <strong>guest virtual address</strong> accessed by the instruction is added to the segment base used by the instruction, forming the <strong>guest linear address</strong>. The guest linear address is then translated by the <strong>paging</strong> mechanism into a <strong>guest physical address</strong>. The guest physical address is then translated via the EPT to a <strong>host physical address</strong>, which is then accessed by the hardware. This is illustrated in the following image:</p>

<p><img src="https://hvmi.github.io/blog/assets/b07_translation.png" alt="Address translation on x86"></p>

<p>When implementing virtual memory, the operating system builds both the descriptor table and the page tables which are responsible for address translation. While the descriptor table is global, hence its name, Global Descriptor Table, or GDT for short (albeit there can also be Local Descriptor Tables as well, but this is not the subject of this blog post) and is the same for the entire system (including all the processes and the kernel), the page-tables used by the processes are different for each process. This means that, for example, <em>svchost.exe</em> and <em>calc.exe</em> use different sets of page tables for their guest linear to guest physical address translation. Therefore, the same guest linear address will translate to different guest physical addresses in different processes.</p>

<p>How are different page-tables used for different processes, though? The CPU always uses the page-tables pointed to by the <strong>CR3</strong> register for the translation. When a thread is scheduled for execution on a physical processor, the kernel will load the CR3 with the base address of the page-tables belonging to the process which owns the thread. Each page-table is 4096 B or 4 KB long, and each entry is 8 B long (4 B on legacy 32-bit paging). The CPU will first translate the virtual address to a linear address, using segmentation, and then it will use the resulting linear address as follows (assuming 4-levels 64 bit paging):</p>

<ul>
  <li>Page Map Level 4, or PML4, will be the starting page-table for translation, and its address is the one in <strong>CR3</strong>;</li>
  <li>Bits 47:39 from the linear address are used to select an 8 B entry inside <strong>PML4</strong>, which is the Page Directory Pointer, or PDP;</li>
  <li>Bits 38:30 from the linear address are used to select an 8 B entry inside <strong>PDP</strong>, which is the Page Directory, or PD;</li>
  <li>Bits 29:21 from the linear address are used to select an 8 B entry inside <strong>PD</strong>, which is the Page Table, or PT;</li>
  <li>Bits 20:12 from the linear address are used to select an 8 b entry inside <strong>PT</strong>, which is the physical page address;</li>
  <li>Bits 11:0 from the linear address are used as an offset inside the physical page.</li>
</ul>

<p>The paging steps are better illustrated in the following image:</p>

<p><img src="https://hvmi.github.io/blog/assets/b07_paging.png" alt="4-Levels Paging on x86"></p>

<h2 id="page-faults">Page Faults</h2>

<p>Each page-table entry has a well defined structure, and several bits have special meaning. While translating addresses, the CPU interprets these bits in order to see how it should proceed with the translation. First, let’s see what control bits are present inside a page-table entry:</p>

<p><img src="https://hvmi.github.io/blog/assets/b07_ptentry.png" alt="Page-Table Entry on x86"></p>

<p>As we can see in the image above, there are several control bits, but only some of them are interesting to us right now:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Bit 0 is the <strong>Present</strong> bit; this indicates whether the entry is valid or not. If the bit is 0, the current entry is invalid, the CPU will stop the page-walk, and it will generate a #PF;</li>
  <li>Bit 1 is the <strong>Read/Write</strong> bit; this bit indicates whether the range mapped by the current entry is read-only (the bit is 0), or read/write (the bit is 1); in order for a page to be writable, this bit must be set to 1 in all page-table levels;</li>
  <li>Bit 2 is the <strong>User/Supervisor</strong> bit; this indicates whether the region mapped by the current entry belongs to the kernel (the bit is 0), or the user (the bit is 1); in order for a page to be user-accessible, this bit must be set to 1 in all page-table levels;</li>
  <li>Bit 5 is the <strong>Accessed</strong> bit, and it is set by the CPU whenever a page translated through that entry is accessed;</li>
  <li>Bit 6 is the <strong>Dirty</strong> bit, and it is set by the CPU whenever the page translated through that entry is written;</li>
  <li>Bit 63 is the <strong>Execute Disable</strong> bit, which controls whether the region of memory translated through the entry is executable or; for a page to be executable, the XD bit must be 0 in all page-table levels;</li>
</ul>

<p>Looking at the list of control bits listed above, we can already infer some conditions that would cause the CPU to generate a #PF:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The Present bit (bit 0) is 0;</li>
  <li>The Read/Write (bit 1) is 0, and there is a write access to the page;</li>
  <li>The User/Supervisor (bit 2) is 0, and there is user-mode access to the page;</li>
  <li>The Execute Disable (bit 63) is 1, and there is an instruction fetch access to the page.</li>
</ul>

<p>In order to properly communicate the cause of the #PF, the CPU will save an error code on the stack when delivering the exception. This way, the operating system kernel can quickly determine what the cause of the #PF is, and it can take measures. If, for example, the #PF is caused because a page is not present in physical memory, the kernel can check whether the page is present in a swap file, and if so, it can read it into the physical memory, it can modify the page-table entry by marking it valid, and it can restart the instruction that triggered the #PF in the first place. If, for example, the page accessed by the instruction is invalid (it’s not mapped at all), the kernel could, for example, kill the process. The layout of the #PF error code is fairly straight forward, and the bits most important to us are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>If bit 0 inside the error code is 0, the #PF was caused by a non-present page; otherwise, it was caused by a present page;</li>
  <li>If bit 1 inside the error code is 0, the #PF was caused by a read access; otherwise, it was caused by a write access;</li>
  <li>If bit 2 inside the error code is 0, the #PF was caused by a supervisor (kernel) access; otherwise, it was caused by a user access;</li>
  <li>If bit 3 inside the error code is 0, the #PF was not caused by a reserved bit being set inside a page-table entry; otherwise, it was caused by a reserved bit being set in a page-table entry;</li>
  <li>If bit 4 inside the error code is 0, the #PF was not caused by a an instruction fetch; otherwise, it was caused by an instruction fetch;</li>
</ul>

<p>For example, an error code of <code>0x3</code> (bit 0 and bit 1 set) would mean that the page-fault was triggered by supervisor code writing to an already-present page, meaning that the page is present, but is marked as read-only inside the page-tables. Likewise, an error code of <code>0x4</code> (bit 2 set) would indicate a #PF caused by user-code reading from a non-present page.</p>

<h2 id="accessing-swapped-out-pages">Accessing Swapped-Out Pages</h2>

<p>Now that we have a good understanding about the paging mechanisms on an x86 CPU, it is time to answer the following question: we can always access guest physical pages, but why can’t we always access a guest linear page? The answer should be pretty obvious: because that page may not be present inside the physical memory - it is marked as not-present (bit 0 - the Present bit - is 0) inside the page-tables. This means that its contents are located somewhere on the storage device, but not inside physical memory. How can we work around this inconvenience, if we really have to inspect the contents of a swapped-out page?</p>

<p>The naive approach would be to somehow access the page on the storage device, but this would come with several drawbacks. First, you’d need a way to access the VMs storage device from the HVMI, which is very difficult, since - remember - we operate completely outside the VM. In addition, you’d have to know the structure of the swap file in order to locate the desired page. Performance is also an issue, since accessing the storage to read swapped-out pages may induce some noticeable performance impact.</p>

<p>A better approach would be to wait for the page to be read naturally by the guest. This can be done by polling the guest memory, to see when the page is brought back inside the physical memory. Even better, the page-tables can be monitored against writes, and when the page-table entry translating the page we wish to read is written, the physical page address can be retrieved, and the physical page can be read. However, this has a great disadvantage: there is no guarantee that the page will ever be accessed again.</p>

<p>What if we’d convince the guest OS to swap in the desired page…? We could do this by executing an instruction inside the guest which would access the page. But executing instructions in guest may be difficult (as we will see in a future blog-post - agents injection inside the VM), so we need a better approach. Luckily, Intel VT-x allows for event injection inside the VM, including exceptions such as #PF. Therefore, we can simply inject a #PF inside the guest, and let the guest kernel handle it as if it was generated naturally by instruction execution.</p>

<h2 id="pf-injection">#PF Injection</h2>

<p>When injecting #PFs inside the guest VM, there are several questions that must be answered.</p>

<p>First of all, we need to classify the #PFs into two categories: user-mode and kernel-mode faults. User-mode faults are injected to access user pages, while kernel-mode faults are injected to access kernel pages. It is important to make this distinction, …</p></div></article></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><a href="https://www.ego-cms.com/tags/tools"><p>Tools</p></a><a href="#"><p>Tools</p></a><p>What are the biggest quality assurance challenges and the best mobile testing techniques to address them? Our QA engineer Yulia Sosedova
provides a detailed answer in this post.</p></div></div><article><div target="_blank"><p>In 2017, users worldwide downloaded around 197 billion applications; some of which were the typical type you use on your device everyday without even thinking about it: social media, messengers, and games. Others were much more practical and down to earth apps for work, communication with colleagues and business partners, tracking your bank accounts, and organizing your lifestyle.</p><p>With such a versatile assortment of programs on your smartphone, you must certainly have some experience choosing an app to suit your needs, and you probably know, at first glance, which application will do. But, have you ever thought about what makes a good app so attractive and trustworthy? We know the answer: they were thoroughly tested during their development and quality assurance process. The app, whose performance was carefully checked on various devices, cannot but fulfil the first and foremost requirement – to look and work properly; however, mobile testing methodology is a very complex issue. In this article, we will help you understand its major pitfalls, advantages, and possibilities for you to perform your app checks seamlessly.</p><h2>Reasons Why Your App Fails</h2><figure id="w-node-69fb50bf0f20-7a0a8b78"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5c755d7d6fa90e6b6027e74c/5cf630197322d17eb7cf3514_Reasons_Why_Your_App_Fails.png" alt=""></p></figure><p>There are plenty of reasons why an application may fail on the market. An experienced developer, who wants to create a really useful and attractive app, should know all of them and test all these risks carefully. The most common are problems such as:</p><ul role="list"><li><strong>Insufficient market research.</strong> It may seem that, if all the information is available, you won’t need to conduct profound market or audience research, but it is a crucial aspect not only of app development itself, but also of the mobile application testing methodology. A deep understanding of your audience’s needs and marketing possibilities heavily influences the choice of testing tools and strategies.</li><li><strong>Lack of post-launch communication.</strong> Your user feedback and ratings are actually an important part of your app performance. Moreover, it may become fruitful for you to polish your future marketing strategy and mobile testing techniques, as well. Organize a smooth and friendly user communication procedure after presenting your app and you may get a pile of new ideas on how to improve your product!</li><li><strong>Low quality content.</strong> Your app should offer something different, otherwise your users will prefer to keep up with the existing state of things and not download your product. To improve the quality of information and service that your program offers, you need to perform a profound usability check.</li><li><strong>Poor user experience.</strong> A caring developer should always keep in mind the overall level of user experience. If you are not sure how to test your program’s UI to see if it’s really what you need, then you’d better hire a UX designer, as this is more important than it is usually thought to be. Your application’s poor navigation, functionality, and design may lead to its failure.</li></ul><p>To avoid these problems, you need to be aware of all the possible challenges and run profound and careful testing.</p><h3>Biggest Testing Challenges</h3><figure id="w-node-d2094611cc61-7a0a8b78"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5c755d7d6fa90e6b6027e74c/5cf6303bf5d840000365328f_Biggest_Testing_Challenges.png" alt=""></p></figure><p>All types of testing for mobile applications have their advantages and drawbacks, and it may sometimes be difficult to perform testing seamlessly. There are a lot of mobile application testing challenges which may prevent you from running the process smoothly. The biggest include:</p><ul role="list"><li><strong>Variety of iOS and Android versions.</strong> Nowadays, there exist a great number of different iOS and Android versions. Specific peculiarities of each of them may heavily influence the performance of your app. To check this, the developer should run consistent compatibility testing on as many devices as possible. It’s a fact that checking each platform’s version may be a real challenge, though it is still absolutely necessary.</li><li><strong>Lack of capacity.</strong> This may include various problems with functionality and equipment, such as lack of physical devices, inability to test on different network connection types, or absence of necessary tools. In this case, a good solution may be to try emulators and cloud-based testing that we will talk about later.</li><li><strong>Location dependence.</strong> We bet that the phrase “To continue, turn on your device location services” seems very familiar to you. Most applications use specific information about your location in their work. Here, we speak not only about GPS procedures, but also about location dependent algorithms that some programs use to provide their users with the best real-time service. Therefore, this feature of the app should be thoroughly tested, which may be a hurdle if there is no possibility to use emulators and developers are forced to take the device to different locations, physically.</li><li><strong>Internationalization.</strong> In our globalized world, not only should the technical characteristics of the application be checked thoroughly, but also its compliance with the needs of users across different cultures and speaking various languages. That is why each app, developed for international use, ought to employ high quality translation and a corresponding layout, neutral design, and multilingual customer support.</li></ul><p>To deal with all those challenges successfully, you need to choose appropriate iOS and Android app testing techniques, along with diverse testing strategies. With constant trial and error, you will find the best solutions for your applications, and we will be happy to help you out.</p><h2>Best Mobile Testing Techniques</h2><figure id="w-node-3d944bc0ec26-7a0a8b78"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5c755d7d6fa90e6b6027e74c/5cf6305d6a6dbf3f4368da09_Best_Mobile-_Testing_Techniques.png" alt=""></p></figure><p>Mobile app testing may involve many issues, and the ones that we have described earlier are only the most prominent. One of the biggest challenges that developers faced while checking their apps’ performance in 2017 was truly quite simple – lack of time and resources. Despite the fact that application testing methodology usually takes lots of time and effort, they are absolutely necessary to perform to achieve a great product. Here, we offer you six types of testing for mobile applications that have proven to be the most needed and successful. They help developers not only test their products, but also gather new ideas on how to improve existing technology. For that reason, there are now many different kinds of processes for mobile app testing. Best practices include:</p><h3>Cloud-based mobile testing</h3><figure id="w-node-78207b6418b3-7a0a8b78"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5c755d7d6fa90e6b6027e74c/5cf6307b616f5e47f106a789_Cloud-based_testing.png" alt=""></p></figure><p>In 2017, more than half of IT companies around the world claimed they use cloud test environments for performance and security testing. Indeed, this testing technique is one of the most renowned, globally, as it can create an almost flawless web environment for running productive testing procedures.</p><p><strong>Pros:</strong></p><ul role="list"><li>Cloud testing can be performed from any location;</li><li>It doesn’t require massive hardware maintenance expenditures;</li><li>Its storage capacity is virtually unlimited.</li></ul><p>That is why this type of testing is very effective for large-scale projects with a huge but unstable number of users from different places. Cloud testing can predict the future functional performance of such apps under a heavy load. However, it does have some disadvantages, too.</p><p><strong>Cons:</strong></p><ul role="list"><li>Lack of security;</li><li>Less autonomy while dealing with your data.</li></ul><h3>Automation Testing</h3><figure id="w-node-c62a1c01e6c1-7a0a8b78"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5c755d7d6fa90e6b6027e74c/5cf630b47322d1c03ecf65a7_Automation_Testing.png" alt=""></p></figure><p>Automation testing remains one of the most effective testing techniques for mobile applications, as it has many undeniable advantages.</p><p><strong>Pros:</strong></p><ul role="list"><li>It is very precise and certain;</li><li>Is very helpful in the event of a highly complex program;</li><li>It has a possibility of simultaneous, or parallel, testing, so it may be performed on several different devices at the same time;</li><li>Provides developers with the fullest possible image of the app’s potential problems;</li><li>Helps developers verify an application’s compatibility with various OS;</li><li>Develops solutions to increase app’s productivity.</li></ul><p>Any developer performing manual testing may make a mistake, though, on the contrary, a series of well-scripted automated tests will provide a desired result.</p><p><strong>Cons:</strong></p><ul role="list"><li>It may require certain primary expenditures;</li><li>Lack of compatibility capacities.</li></ul><h3>Alpha and Beta Testing</h3><figure id="w-node-44e5ec6212b9-7a0a8b78"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5c755d7d6fa90e6b6027e74c/5cf630c67322d16439cf6cf2_Alpha_BetaTesting.png" alt=""></p></figure><p>With an incredibly high level of competitiveness in today’s technology market, any app developer understands how important it is to meet the needs of the users and satisfy all their wishes. To attract as many users as possible, and leave them happy and loyal to your product, you should not only investigate markets and develop reliable economic strategies, but also test your app on real users before releasing it to the open market.</p><p>That is why Alpha and Beta testing are performed. They have many crucial advantages. To start with, Alpha testing is performed internally within the company, and the testers are usually its employees. Beta testing, on the contrary, is done by real users – a limited number of people, who give their feedback about the program’s performance.</p><p><strong>Pros:</strong></p><ul role="list"><li>Involve different auditories to check the app’s performance;</li><li>Can reveal certain minor drawbacks of design, navigation or security of the application;</li><li>Serve as a base for developers to initiate changes that will make the app more convenient and pleasant to use.</li></ul><p>However, nothing is perfect and Alpha and Beta testing have their drawbacks, too.</p><p><strong>Cons:</strong></p><ul role="list"><li>Beta testers, who can check the application performance, may be difficult to find;</li><li>Lack of control over the testing.</li></ul><h3>L10N and I18N Testing</h3><figure id="w-node-c1a25407a2cf-7a0a8b78"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5c755d7d6fa90e6b6027e74c/5cf630dc8229847416c0de07_L10N_I18N_Testing.png" alt=""></p></figure><p>We have already mentioned here how important it may be to adjust your product to the needs of users all over the world, and this includes some efforts for proper localization and internationalization. This is why it is necessary to check the application’s functionality, especially if the information it operates with is in different languages and comes from different places. Here, I18N testing means partial compliance with foreign data, as the core of information remains in the native language (usually English).</p><p>L10N testing includes I18N and some other adaptations.</p><p><strong>Pros:</strong></p><ul role="list"><li>The program is tested to run seamlessly with data inputs in any language;</li><li>May check any textual updates, menu formats, new settings, date and time formats;</li><li>Adjust …</li></ul></div></article></div>

                We tackle the human motion imitation, appearance transfer, and novel view synthesis within a uniﬁed
                framework, which means that the model once being trained can be used to handle all these tasks. The
                existing taskspeciﬁc methods mainly use 2D keypoints (pose) to estimate the human body structure.
                However, they only expresses the position information with no abilities to characterize the personalized
                shape of the individual person and model the limbs rotations. In this paper, we propose to use a 3D body
                mesh recovery module to disentangle the pose and shape, which can not only model the joint location and
                rotation but also characterize the personalized body shape. To preserve the source information, such as
                texture, style, color, and face identity, we propose a Liquid Warping GAN with Liquid Warping Block
                (LWB) that propagates the source information in both image and feature spaces, and synthesizes an image
                with respect to the reference. Speciﬁcally, the source features are extracted by a denoising
                convolutional auto-encoder for characterizing the source identity well. Furthermore, our proposed method
                is able to support a more ﬂexible warping from multiple sources. In addition, we build a new dataset,
                namely Impersonator (iPER) dataset, for the evaluation of human motion imitation, appearance transfer,
                and novel view synthesis. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in several
                aspects, such as robustness in occlusion case and preserving face identity, shape consistency and
                clothes details.

<p>Bash scripts. Almost anyone needs to write one sooner or later. Almost no one says “yeah, I love writing them”. And that’s why almost everyone is putting low attention while writing them.</p>



<p>I won’t try to make you a Bash expert (since I’m not a one either), but I will show you a minimal template that will make your scripts safer. You don’t need to thank me, your future self will thank you.</p>



<h2><span id="why_scripting_in_bash"></span>Why scripting in Bash?<span></span></h2>



<p>The best summary of Bash scripting appeared recently on my Twitter feed:</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>The opposite of "it's like riding a bike" is "it's like programming in bash".</p><p>A phrase which means that no matter how many times you do something, you will have to re-learn it every single time.</p></div>— Jake Wharton (@JakeWharton) <a href="https://twitter.com/JakeWharton/status/1334177665356587008?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 2, 2020</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>But Bash has something in common with another widely beloved language. Just like JavaScript, it won’t go away easily. While we can hope that Bash won’t become the main language for literally everything, it’s always somewhere near.</p>



<p>Bash <a href="https://www.quora.com/Is-Bash-considered-the-lingua-franca-of-shells/answer/Paul-Reiber">inherited the shell throne</a> and can be found on almost every Linux, including Docker images. And this is the environment in which most of the backend runs. So if you need to script the server application startup, a CI/CD step, or integration test run, Bash is there for you.</p>



<p>To glue few commands together, pass output from one to another, and just start some executable, Bash is the easiest and most native solution. While it makes perfect sense to write bigger, more complicated scripts in other languages, you can’t expect to have Python, Ruby, fish, or whatever another interpreter you believe is the best, available everywhere. And you probably should think twice and then once more before adding it to some prod server, Docker image, or CI environment.</p>



<p>Yet Bash is far from perfect. The syntax is a nightmare. Error handling is difficult. There are landmines everywhere. And we have to deal with it.</p>



<h2><span id="bash_script_template"></span>Bash script template<span></span></h2>



<p>Without further ado, here it is.</p>



<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/env bash

set -Eeuo pipefail
trap cleanup SIGINT SIGTERM ERR EXIT

script_dir=$(cd "$(dirname "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}")" &amp;&gt;/dev/null &amp;&amp; pwd -P)

usage() {
  cat &lt;&lt;EOF
Usage: $(basename "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}") [-h] [-v] [-f] -p param_value arg1 [arg2...]

Script description here.

Available options:

-h, --help      Print this help and exit
-v, --verbose   Print script debug info
-f, --flag      Some flag description
-p, --param     Some param description
EOF
  exit
}

cleanup() {
  trap - SIGINT SIGTERM ERR EXIT
  # script cleanup here
}

setup_colors() {
  if [[ -t 2 ]] &amp;&amp; [[ -z "${NO_COLOR-}" ]] &amp;&amp; [[ "${TERM-}" != "dumb" ]]; then
    NOFORMAT='\033[0m' RED='\033[0;31m' GREEN='\033[0;32m' ORANGE='\033[0;33m' BLUE='\033[0;34m' PURPLE='\033[0;35m' CYAN='\033[0;36m' YELLOW='\033[1;33m'
  else
    NOFORMAT='' RED='' GREEN='' ORANGE='' BLUE='' PURPLE='' CYAN='' YELLOW=''
  fi
}

msg() {
  echo &gt;&amp;2 -e "${1-}"
}

die() {
  local msg=$1
  local code=${2-1} # default exit status 1
  msg "$msg"
  exit "$code"
}

parse_params() {
  # default values of variables set from params
  flag=0
  param=''

  while :; do
    case "${1-}" in
    -h | --help) usage ;;
    -v | --verbose) set -x ;;
    --no-color) NO_COLOR=1 ;;
    -f | --flag) flag=1 ;; # example flag
    -p | --param) # example named parameter
      param="${2-}"
      shift
      ;;
    -?*) die "Unknown option: $1" ;;
    *) break ;;
    esac
    shift
  done

  args=("$@")

  # check required params and arguments
  [[ -z "${param-}" ]] &amp;&amp; die "Missing required parameter: param"
  [[ ${#args[@]} -eq 0 ]] &amp;&amp; die "Missing script arguments"

  return 0
}

parse_params "$@"
setup_colors

# script logic here

msg "${RED}Read parameters:${NOFORMAT}"
msg "- flag: ${flag}"
msg "- param: ${param}"
msg "- arguments: ${args[*]-}"</code></pre>



<p>The idea was to not make it too long. I don’t want to scroll 500 lines to the script logic. At the same time, I want some strong foundations for any script. But Bash is not making this easy, lacking any form of dependencies management.</p>



<p>One solution would be to have a separate script with all the boilerplate and utility functions and execute it at the beginning. The downside would be to have to always attach this second file everywhere, losing the “simple Bash script” idea along the way. So I decided to put in the template only what I consider to be a minimum to keep it possible short.</p>



<p>Now let’s look at it in more detail.</p>



<h3><span id="choose_bash"></span>Choose Bash<span></span></h3>



<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/env bash</code></pre>



<p>Script traditionally starts with a shebang. For the <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/21612980/why-is-usr-bin-env-bash-superior-to-bin-bash">best compatibility</a>, it references <code>/usr/bin/env</code>, not the <code>/bin/bash</code> directly. Although, if you read comments in the linked StackOverflow question, even this can fail sometimes.</p>



<h3><span id="fail_fast"></span>Fail fast<span></span></h3>



<pre><code>set -Eeuo pipefail</code></pre>



<p>The <code>set</code> command changes script execution options. For example, <strong>normally Bash does not care if some command failed</strong>, returning a non-zero exit status code. It just happily jumps to the next one. Now consider this little script:</p>



<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/env bash
cp important_file ./backups/
rm important_file</code></pre>



<p>What will happen, if the <code>backups</code> directory does not exist? Exactly, you will get an error message in the console, but before you will be able to react, the file will be already removed by the second command.</p>



<p>For details on what options exactly <code>set -Eeuo pipefail</code> changes and how they will protect you, I refer you to the <a href="https://vaneyckt.io/posts/safer_bash_scripts_with_set_euxo_pipefail/">article I have in my bookmarks for a few years now</a>.</p>



<p>Although you should know that there are some <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/commandline/comments/g1vsxk/the_first_two_statements_of_your_bash_script/fniifmk?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3">arguments against setting those options</a>.</p>



<h3><span id="get_the_location"></span>Get the location<span></span></h3>



<pre><code>script_dir=$(cd "$(dirname "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}")" &amp;&gt;/dev/null &amp;&amp; pwd -P)</code></pre>



<p>This line <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/246128/2512304">does its best</a> to define the script’s location directory<s>, and then we <code>cd</code> to it. Why?</s></p>



<p>Often our scripts are operating on paths relative to the script location, copying files and executing commands, assuming the script directory is also a working directory. And it is, as long as we execute the script from its directory.</p>



<p>But if, let’s say, our CI config executes script like this:</p>



<pre><code>/opt/ci/project/script.sh</code></pre>



<p>then our script is operating not in project dir, but some completely different workdir of our CI tool. We can fix it, by going to the directory before executing the script:</p>



<pre><code>cd /opt/ci/project &amp;&amp; ./script.sh</code></pre>



<p>But it’s much nicer to solve this on the script side. So, if the script reads some file or executes another program from the same directory, call it like this:</p>



<pre><code>cat "$script_dir/my_file"</code></pre>



<p>At the same time, the script does not change the workdir location. If the script is executed from some other directory and the user provides a relative path to some file, we will still be able to read it.</p>



<h3><span id="try_to_clean_up"></span>Try to clean up<span></span></h3>



<pre><code>trap cleanup SIGINT SIGTERM ERR EXIT

cleanup() {
  trap - SIGINT SIGTERM ERR EXIT
  # script cleanup here
}</code></pre>



<p>Think about the <code>trap</code> like of a <code>finally</code> block for the script. At the end of the script – normal, caused by an error or an external signal – the <code>cleanup()</code> function will be executed. This is a place where you can, for example, try to remove all temporary files created by the script.</p>



<p>Just remember that the <code>cleanup()</code> can be called not only at the end but as well having the script done any part of the work. Not necessarily all the resources you try to cleanup will exist.</p>



<h3><span id="display_helpful_help"></span>Display helpful help<span></span></h3>



<pre><code>usage() {
  cat &lt;&lt;EOF
Usage: $(basename "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}") [-h] [-v] [-f] -p param_value arg1 [arg2...]

Script description here.

...
EOF
  exit
}</code></pre>



<p>Having the <code>usage()</code> relatively close to the top of the script, it will act in two ways:</p>



<ul><li>to <strong>display help</strong> for someone who does not know all the options and does not want to go over the whole script to discover them,</li><li>as a <strong>minimal documentation</strong> when someone modifies the script (for example you, 2 weeks later, not even remembering writing it in the first place).</li></ul>



<p>I don’t argue to document every function here. But a short, nice script usage message is a required minimum.</p>



<h3><span id="print_nice_messages"></span>Print nice messages<span></span></h3>



<pre><code>setup_colors() {
  if [[ -t 2 ]] &amp;&amp; [[ -z "${NO_COLOR-}" ]] &amp;&amp; [[ "${TERM-}" != "dumb" ]]; then
    NOFORMAT='\033[0m' RED='\033[0;31m' GREEN='\033[0;32m' ORANGE='\033[0;33m' BLUE='\033[0;34m' PURPLE='\033[0;35m' CYAN='\033[0;36m' YELLOW='\033[1;33m'
  else
    NOFORMAT='' RED='' GREEN='' ORANGE='' BLUE='' PURPLE='' CYAN='' YELLOW=''
  fi
}

msg() {
  echo &gt;&amp;2 -e "${1-}"
}</code></pre>



<p>Firstly, remove the <code>setup_colors()</code> function if you don’t want to use colors in text anyway. I keep it because I know I would use colors more often if I wouldn’t have to google codes for them every time.</p>



<p>Secondly, those <strong>colors are meant to be used with the <code>msg()</code> function only</strong>, not with the <code>echo</code> command.</p>



<p>The <strong><code>msg()</code> function is meant to be used to print everything that is not a script output</strong>. This includes all logs and messages, not only the errors. Citing the great <a href="https://medium.com/@jdxcode/12-factor-cli-apps-dd3c227a0e46">12 Factor CLI Apps</a> article:</p>



<blockquote><p><strong>In short: stdout is for output, stderr is for messaging.</strong></p><cite><a href="https://jdxcode.com/">Jeff Dickey</a>, who <a href="https://github.com/oclif/oclif/graphs/contributors">knows a little</a> about <a href="https://github.com/heroku/cli/graphs/contributors">building CLI apps</a></cite></blockquote>



<p>That’s why in most cases you shouldn’t use colors for <code>stdout</code> anyway.</p>



<p>Messages printed with <code>msg()</code> are sent to <code>stderr</code> stream and support special sequences, like colors. And colors are disabled anyway if the <code>stderr</code> output is not an interactive terminal or&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://no-color.org/" rel="noreferrer noopener">one of the standard parameters</a>&nbsp;is passed.</p>



<p>Usage:</p>



<pre><code>msg "This is a ${RED}very important${NOFORMAT} message, but not a script output value!"</code></pre>



<p>To check how it behaves when the <code>stderr</code> is not an interactive terminal, add a line like above to the script. Then execute it redirecting <code>stderr</code> to <code>stdout</code> and piping it to <code>cat</code>. Pipe operation makes the output no longer being sent directly to the terminal, but to the next command, so the colors should be disabled now.</p>



<pre><code>$ ./test.sh 2&gt;&amp;1 | cat
This is a very important message, but not a script output value!</code></pre>



<h3><span id="parse_any_parameters"></span>Parse any parameters<span></span></h3>



<pre><code>parse_params() {
  # default values of variables set from params
  flag=0
  param=''

  while :; do
    case "${1-}" in
    -h | --help) usage ;;
    -v | --verbose) set -x ;;
    --no-color) NO_COLOR=1 ;;
    -f | --flag) flag=1 ;; # example flag
    -p | --param) # …</code></pre></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><h2>What’s wrong with current voice UIs</h2><p>There is a lot of positive momentum around <a href="https://www.speechly.com/blog/what-is-voice-user-interface/">voice interfaces</a>. We’ve all seen the stats: the number of smart speakers in US households has risen steadily for the past five years. The share of <a href="https://www.speechly.com/blog/voice-search/">voice searches</a> of all search engine traffic has soared. Yet, the type of revolution that the touch screen gave birth to, after the launch of the iPhone, hasn’t really happened for voice — despite all the hype. Why is that?</p><p>Anyone who has a bit of experience from using voice interfaces knows that you can do simple things like setting on the alarm, switching on the lights, or playing your favorite music on Spotify pretty easily. However, if you try to do anything more sophisticated, say, <a href="https://www.speechly.com/use-cases/fast-food-ordering/">order pizza</a> for your eight best friends, reserve an intercontinental flight for a family of five, or buy a new party dress online, the chances are that you're going to fail miserably. For more demanding and for most real-world tasks, the user experience with voice just isn’t there yet — at least as it is for the touch screen.</p><p>Still, contrary to what people might think, the problem is not really anymore in speech recognition or natural language understanding accuracy. Even for fairly open-ended domains, both speech recognition and natural language understanding accuracy is pretty close to human parity.</p><p>The problem lies rather in the way these systems give feedback to the user. Typically, when a voice command is uttered, the modern <a href="https://www.speechly.com/blog/why-smart-speakers-are-not-the-future-of-voice/">voice assistants</a> wait until the user has stopped talking (using the technique called endpointing) before they start processing it. This works great for short things like “turn on the lights” or “Play X on Spotify”. However, for more complex tasks this is a disaster.</p><p>Imagine if you need to express something that requires a longer explanation. When looking for a new t-shirt, a person might be tempted to say something like “I’m interested in t-shirts for men ...in color red, blue or orange, let’s say Boss ...no wait, I mean Hilfiger ...maybe size medium or large ...and something that’s on sale and can be shipped by tomorrow ...and I’d like to see the cheapest options first.”</p><p>When uttering something this long and winding to a traditional voice UI, most likely something will go wrong, resulting in the familiar, “Sorry, I didn’t quite get that.” Having just made the extended effort of explaining your intent to the system, this is an extremely frustrating experience. Or even worse, the endpointing might trigger a false positive half way the utterance, causing the voice assistant to prematurely resolve the intent and start a voice synthesis response, interrupting the speaker violently and irritatingly.</p><p>In the following sections of this article, we will introduce the powerful techniques of streaming spoken language understanding and reactive <a href="https://www.speechly.com/blog/voice-application-design-guide/">multi-modal voice user interfaces</a> that address the very problem the current generation of voice UIs suffer from.</p><h2>Streaming Spoken Language Understanding</h2><p>Contrary to the traditional voice systems that rely on endpointing to trigger a response, the systems using streaming spoken language understanding actively try to comprehend the user intent from the very moment the user starts to talk. The idea is that as soon as the user says something actionable, the UI is able to instantly react to it.</p><p>The benefit here is that if the system does not understand the user, the UI will instantly signal this back. This way the UI will fail fast but also recover quickly as the user can immediately stop, correct, and continue. On the other hand, if the system does understand the user, also this information is conveyed immediately. This gives reassurance to the user that their message is going through, and that they can continue their expression. As long as the system understands, the user can just go on and on, which results in longer and more complex utterances that are supported.</p><p>Moreover, the immediate feedback from both the small failures and successes of the UI can be combined in a way that the users can correct either themselves or the UI in an online manner, e.g., “I’m interested in Boss, no, I mean Tommy Hilfiger”. This ushers a way for the UI to not only support more sophisticated and complex UI workflows but also a more stream-of-consciousness way of expressing the users’ intent. This is more natural for humans and requires much less effort than the very specific way that the current voice UIs require the utterances to be given.</p><h2>Reactive and non interruptive multi-modal voice user interfaces</h2><p>The most prominent feedback modality of the current day voice interfaces is voice synthesis. As a feedback mechanism, however, this works poorly as any ongoing user utterance will be abruptly interrupted — a problem exhibited commonly in the contemporary voice UIs. As a feedback mechanism, voice is also a pretty narrow band. Instead, the feedback should be given with a non-interruptive modality. Such modalities include haptic, non-linguistic auditory, and perhaps most naturally and expressively, visual feedback. Using these modalities, the UI can react fast and without interruption to the user. For instance, in the case of “I’m interested in t-shirts,” the UI would swiftly show the most popular t-shirt products, instantly enabling the user to continue with a refining utterance, ”do you have Boss.” This narrows further down the displayed products to show only the Boss branded t-shirts.</p><p>This iteration loop reminisces a familiar setting to everybody: human face-to-face communication, which is, in effect, a reactive, multimodal communication setup. In fact, it is a common misperception that human face-to-face conversation is primarily turn-based (or half-duplex) in a similar fashion that chatbots or voice assistance are. Meaning, first I say something, then you say something, then I say something again, and so on. Not exclusively. The human face-to-face conversation is very much full-duplex: as one person talks, the listener gives feedback with nods, facial expressions, gestures, and interjections like aha and mhm. Furthermore, if the person listening doesn't understand what is being said, they are likely to start making more or less subtle facial expressions to signal their lack of comprehension. This is the tight full-duplex feedback loop that makes human face-to-face communication so efficient. The same efficiency is exhibited in the reactive multi-modal voice user computer interfaces!</p><h2>Voice is not the UI, voice is a modality!</h2><p>At the height of the voice assistant hype ushered in by Amazon Alexa, many probably heard the flying phrase “Voice is the UI!”. This article disagrees. Voice is a modality! By augmenting a UI with voice in combination with other available modalities, the result can be an extremely efficient UI.</p><blockquote><p>The perfect interface is when you can use touch and voice seamlessly and choose the best option for the context, sometimes interchangeably</p></blockquote><p>This efficiency comes from how the modalities work together, not from voice alone. Voice is, for instance, a very efficient method for <a href="https://www.speechly.com/design/">inputting rich information</a>. For scrolling, swiping, pointing, or selecting between a couple of valid alternatives, touch is probably better. For displaying complex multidimensional information, the visual display is unbeatable. Combining all of these modalities in a smart way is the killer app.</p><h2>What was the revolutionary thing in the iPhone?</h2><p>Circling back to where we started, the iPhone moment. What made the iPhone so powerful? Well, the very intuitive swipe and pinch gestures with which the user could effortlessly control their phone. However, when the iPhone came out, the touch screen wasn't a new thing. There had been prior touch screen devices. They just sucked! You could swipe or press, and a second or two later something would happen.</p><p>What the iPhone brought to the mix was the extremely fast feedback that its touch screen could provide to the user, resulting in the very intuitive, fluid, and satisfying user experience of controlling your phone. Voice UIs based on streaming spoken language understanding are a similar type of revolution. The streaming spoken language understanding offers extremely fast, fluid, and intuitive feedback to the user akin to what the iPhone brought to the controlling devices back in 2007. However — this time, voice is in the center, providing user experiences that we haven’t seen before, ushering the iPhone moment at last for voice as well.</p></div></div></div></div>]]>

<div>

<div>

<div>
<p>We are taking a practical approach in the following sections. As such, we need the right tools and environments available in order to keep up with the examples and exercises. We will be using <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/">Rust</a> along with packages that will form our scientific stack, such as <code>ndarray</code> (for multi-dimensional containers) and <code>plotly</code> (for interactive graphing), etc. We will write all of our code within a <a href="https://jupyter.org/">Jupyter Notebook</a>, but you are free to use other IDEs.</p>
</div>
</div>

<div>

<div>
<div>
<h2 id="Install-Miniconda">Install Miniconda<a href="#Install-Miniconda">¶</a>
</h2>
<p>There are many different ways to get up and running with an environment that will facilitate our work. One approach I can recommend is to install and use Miniconda.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Miniconda is a free minimal installer for conda. It is a small, bootstrap version of Anaconda that includes only conda, Python, the packages they depend on, and a small number of other useful packages, including pip, zlib and a few others.</p>
<p>— <cite>https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html</cite></p>
</blockquote>
<p>You can skip Miniconda entirely if you prefer and install Jupyter Lab directly, however, I prefer using it to manage other environments too.</p>
<p>You can find installation instructions for Miniconda on <a href="https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html">their website</a>, but if you're using Linux (e.g. Ubuntu) you can execute the following commands from in your terminal:</p>
<div><pre><span></span>wget https://repo.continuum.io/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
chmod +x Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
./Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh</pre></div>
<p>This will download the installation files and start the interactive installation process. Follow the process to the end, where you should see the following message:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Thank you for installing Miniconda3!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>All that's left is to close and re-open the terminal window.</p>

</div>
</div>
</div>
<div>

<div>
<div>
<h2 id="Create-Your-Environment">Create Your Environment<a href="#Create-Your-Environment">¶</a>
</h2>
<p>Once Miniconda is installed, we need to create and configure our environment. If you added Miniconda to your PATH environment during the installation process, then you can run these commands directly from Terminal, Powershell, or CMD.</p>
<p>Now we can create and configure our conda environment using the following commands.</p>
<div><pre><span></span>conda create -n darn <span>python</span><span>=</span><span>3</span></pre></div>
<p>You can replace <code>darn</code> (<strong>D</strong>ata <strong>An</strong>alytics with <strong>R</strong>ust <strong>N</strong>otebooks) with a name of your choosing.</p>

</div>
</div>
</div>
<div>

<div>
<div>
<p>This will create a conda environment named <code>darn</code> with the latest Python 3 package ready to go. You should be presented with a list of packages that will be installed and asked if you wish to proceed. To do so, just enter the character <code>y</code>. If this operation is successful, you should see the following output at the end:</p>
<div><pre><span></span>Preparing transaction: <span>done</span>
Verifying transaction: <span>done</span>
Executing transaction: <span>done</span>
<span>#</span>
<span># To activate this environment, use</span>
<span>#</span>
<span>#     $ conda activate darn</span>
<span>#</span>
<span># To deactivate an active environment, use</span>
<span>#</span>
<span>#     $ conda deactivate</span></pre></div>
<p>As the message suggests, you will need to type the following command to activate and start entering commands within our environment named <code>darn</code>.</p>

<p>Once you do that, you should see your terminal prompt now leads with the environment name within parentheses:</p>

<div>
<p>Note</p>
<p>The example above shows the macOS machine name "melica" and the user "shahin". You will see something different on your machine, and it may appear in a different format on a different operating system such as Windows. As long as the prompt leads with "(darn)", you are on the right track.</p>
</div>
<p>This will allow you to identify which environment you are currently operating in. If you restart your machine, you should be able to use <code>conda activate darn</code> within your conda prompt to get back into the same environment.</p>

</div>
</div>
</div>
<div>

<div>
<div>
<h2 id="Install-Packages">Install Packages<a href="#Install-Packages">¶</a>
</h2>
<p>If your environment was already configured and ready, you would be able to enter the command <code>jupyter lab</code> to launch an instance of the Jupyter Lab IDE in the current directory. However, if we try that in our newly created environment, we will receive an error:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>(</span>darn<span>)</span> melica:~ shahin$ jupyter lab
-bash: jupyter: <span>command</span> not found</pre></div>

</div>
</div>
</div>
<div>

<div>
<div>
<p>So let's fix that. Let's install Jupyter Lab and use the <code>-y</code> option which automatically says "yes" to any questions asked during the installation process.</p>
<div><pre><span></span>conda install -c conda-forge <span>jupyterlab</span><span>=</span><span>2</span>.2.9</pre></div>
<p>We'll also need <code>cmake</code> later on.</p>
<div><pre><span></span>conda install -c anaconda cmake -y</pre></div>
<p>Finally, let's install nodejs. This is needed to run our Jupyter Lab extension in the next section.</p>
<div><pre><span></span>conda install -c conda-forge <span>nodejs</span><span>=</span><span>15</span> -y</pre></div>

</div>
</div>
</div>
<div>

<div>
<div>
<h2 id="Install-Jupyer-Lab-Extensions">Install Jupyer Lab Extensions<a href="#Install-Jupyer-Lab-Extensions">¶</a>
</h2>
<p>There's one last thing we need to do before we move on, and that's installing any Jupyter Lab extensions that we may need. One particular extension that we need is the plotly extension, which will allow our Jupyter Notebooks to render our Plotly visualisations. Within your conda environment, simply run the following command:</p>
<div><pre><span></span>jupyter labextension install jupyterlab-plotly</pre></div>
<p>This may take some time, especially when it builds your jupyterlab assets, so keep an eye on it until you're returned control over the conda prompt, i.e. when you see the following:</p>

<p>Optionally, you may wish to install the purple looking theme from Figure 1 above.</p>
<div><pre><span></span>jupyter labextension install @shahinrostami/theme-purple-please</pre></div>
<p>Now we're good to go!</p>

</div>
</div>
</div>
<div>

<div>
<div>
<h2 id="Install-Rust">Install Rust<a href="#Install-Rust">¶</a>
</h2>
<p>Now we'll install Rust using rustup, but you can check out the <a href="https://forge.rust-lang.org/infra/other-installation-methods.html">other installation methods</a> if you need them.</p>
<div><pre><span></span>curl --proto <span>'=https'</span> --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs <span>|</span> sh</pre></div>
<p>The code samples in this book will work in many versions of Rust, but I can confirm them to be working with version <code>1.42.0</code>. You can get the same version with:</p>

<p>You will be given instructions for adding Cargo's bin directory to your PATH environment variable.</p>

<p>This will work until your close your terminal, so make sure to add it to your shell profile. I use Z shell (Zsh) so this meant adding the following to <code>.zshrc</code>:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>export</span> <span>PATH</span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span>$HOME</span><span>/.cargo/bin:</span><span>$PATH</span><span>"</span></pre></div>
<p>You can make sure everything works by closing and re-opening your terminal and typing <code>cargo</code>. If this returns the usage documentation then you're all set.</p>

</div>
</div>
</div>
<div>

<div>
<div>
<div>
<p>Note</p>
<p>Don't forget to activate your environment when opening the terminal.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div>

<div>
<div>
<h2 id="Install-the-EvCxR-Jupyter-Kernel">Install the EvCxR Jupyter Kernel<a href="#Install-the-EvCxR-Jupyter-Kernel">¶</a>
</h2>
<p>Now we'll install the <a href="https://github.com/google/evcxr/blob/master/evcxr_jupyter/README.md">EvCxR Jupyter Kernel</a>. If you're wondering how it's pronounced, it's <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/9irjm7/evcxr_a_repl_and_jupyter_kernel_for_rust/e6mphus?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x">been mentioned to be "Evic-ser"</a>. This is what will allow us to execute Rust code in a Jupyter Notebook.</p>
<p>You can get <a href="https://github.com/google/evcxr/blob/master/evcxr_jupyter/README.md">other installation methods</a> methods for EvCxR if you need then, but we will be using:</p>
<div><pre><span></span>cargo install evcxr_jupyter --version <span>0</span>.5.3
evcxr_jupyter --install</pre></div>

</div>
</div>
</div>

<div>

<div>
<div>
<p>Let's test if everything is working as it should be. In your conda prompt, within your conda environment, run the following command</p>

<p>This should start the Jupyter Lab server and launch a browser window with the IDE ready to use.</p>

<p><img src="https://datacrayon.com/images/rust-notebooks/fresh_jupyter.png" alt="Jupyter Lab With Rust">
</p>
<center><p><strong>Figure 2</strong> - A fresh installation of Jupyter Lab.</p></center>
<p>Let's create a new notebook. In the Launcher tab which has opened by default, click "Rust" under the Notebook heading. This will create a new and empty notebook named <code>Untitled.ipynb</code> in the current directory.</p>
<p>If everything is configured as it should be, you should see no errors. Type the following into the first cell and click the "play" button to execute it and create a new cell.</p>

</div>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<div>
<p>In&nbsp;[2]:</p>

    </div>
</div>
</div>



</div>
<div>

<div>
<p>If we followed all the instructions and didn't encounter any errors, everything should be working. We should see "Hello World!" in the output cell.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div>

<div>
<div>
<h2 id="Conclusion">Conclusion<a href="#Conclusion">¶</a>
</h2>
<p>In this section, we've downloaded, installed, configured, and tested our environment such that we're ready to run the following examples and experiments. If you ever find that you're missing Jupyter Lab packages, you can install them in the same way as we installed Jupyter Lab and the others in this section.</p>

<p>The papers below are presented in chronological order.</p>

<h2 id="a-theory-of-optimum-currency-areas">A Theory of Optimum Currency Areas</h2>
<hr>

<p>Author: Robert A. Mundell</p>

<p>Publication: The American Economic Review</p>

<p>Published: September 1961</p>

<p>Link: <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/1812792">Click Here</a></p>

<p>This article is an introduction to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optimum_currency_area">Optimum Currency Areas</a> in both theory and application. The managing of currency through monetary policy by a central bank or other authority serves the purpose of absorbing unemployment through expansion when unemployment is high as well as curbing inflation when inflation is high. This, however, assumes that a region is homogeneous with respect to its need for monetary policy. Some countries may contain multiple regions, e.g., <a href="https://www.yalelawjournal.org/article/stuck-the-law-and-economics-of-residential-stagnation">the US had the ailing Rust Belt and the booming Silicon Valley in the 2010s</a>. Other countries may all belong to a single region, e.g., the Nordic countries. In the former case, monetary policy may benefit one region at the expense of another. In the latter case, monetary policy could be coordinated to reduce inefficiencies. The optimum currency scheme divides currencies among homogeneous regions.</p>

<p><img width="50%" height="50%" src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/545054/pexels-photo-545054.jpeg?auto=compress&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;dpr=2&amp;h=750&amp;w=1260"></p>

<p>The author is careful to note that currencies are not created in a vacuum and are an expression of national sovereignty. It may be the case that a country would accept the inefficiencies to retain control of its currency. However, ideas for economic integration, e.g., the European Union at the time, may prove a testing ground for both an appetite and the application of OCA, and they did!</p>

<p>This article is part of the <a href="https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.101.1.1">American Economic Review’s Top 20 articles</a> from the journal’s first 100 years.</p>

<h2 id="the-paranoid-style-in-american-politics">The Paranoid Style in American Politics</h2>
<hr>

<p>Author: Richard Hofstader</p>

<p>Publication: Harper’s Magazine</p>

<p>Published: November 1964</p>

<p>Link: <a href="https://harpers.org/archive/1964/11/the-paranoid-style-in-american-politics/">Click Here</a></p>

<p><em>The Paranoid Style in American Politics</em> is a rhetorical analysis of American politics. The author describes a mode of rhetoric that is often divisive, conspiratorial, and mean-spirited. While the paranoid style is introduced in the context of right-wing thought in the 1960s (the present day of the article), author contends that “The paranoid style is an old and recurrent phenomenon in our public life which has been frequently linked with movements of suspicious discontent…and its targets have ranged from “the international bankers” to Masons, Jesuits, and munitions makers”.</p>

<p>The most interesting bit of the essay discusses examples that employ this style. While one might think that conspiracy theorists have jumbled patterns of thought or crippled epistemologies, the author contends that</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>“The higher paranoid scholarship is nothing if not coherent—in fact the paranoid mind is far more coherent than the real world. It is nothing if not scholarly in technique. McCarthy’s 96-page pamphlet, McCarthyism, contains no less than 313 footnote references, and Mr. Welch’s incredible assault on Eisenhower, The Politician, has one hundred pages of bibliography and notes. The entire right-wing movement of our time is a parade of experts, study groups, monographs, footnotes, and bibliographies.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The author closes by conjecturing that this sort of thinking is not unique to a particular time and place; rather, it is part of the human psyche. This essay provides a useful lens when considering the divisive political rhetoric of the present day.</p>

<p>I came across this article while reading <a href="https://brill.com/abstract/book/edcoll/9789004382022/BP000012.xml"><em>Close Companions? Esotericism and Conspiracy Theories</em></a> from Egil Asprem and Asbjørn Dyrendal which deserves an honorable mention in this year’s list. This paper applies methods from religious studies to better understand conspiratorial thinking and rhetoric.</p>

<h2 id="the-theory-of-interstellar-trade">The Theory of Interstellar Trade</h2>
<hr>

<p>Author: Paul Krugman</p>

<p>Publication: Economic Inquiry</p>

<p>Published: 1978/2010</p>

<p>Link: <a href="https://fermatslibrary.com/s/the-theory-of-interstellar-trade">Click Here</a></p>

<p>This is an satirical paper written by Paul Krugman in 1978 but not published for over 30 years. As the paper states, it is a serious analysis of a silly topic: the theory of trade across long (light years) distances. The setup is that interplanetary trade can be modeled as international trade; however, interstellar trade requires special considerations: transporting goods will take long periods of time even when traveling near the speed of light; and time becomes relative to the observer (whether on a specific planet or a cargo ship) in an Einsteinian universe.</p>

<p>Krugman “proves” two fundamental theorems of interstellar trade:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>(1) “When trade takes place between two planets in a common inertial frame, the interest costs on goods in transit should be calculated using time measured by clocks in the common frame, and not by clocks in the frames of trading spacecraft”</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>(2) “If sentient beings may hold assets on two planets in the same inertial frame, competition will equalize interest rates on the two planets.”</p>

<p>In addition to being a joy to read, Krugman jabs at the conventions of economic research, pointing to problematic or absurd practices without offering a comprehensive critique. At its worst, this article is the amusing grumblings of a disgruntled researcher; at its best, it’s an interesting take on methodology.</p>

<p>This article argues that the practice of establishing derivational robustness in economics provides epistemic support for economic theories in lieu of empirical evidence. This attempts to explain what it is that economists do in much of their research.</p>

<p>The authors divide model assumptions into three categories: substantial assumptions, Galilean assumptions, and tractability assumptions. Substantial assumptions “identify a set of causal factors that in interaction make up the causal mechanism about which the modeller endeavours to make important claims”. These are the claims we expect to be veridical. Galilean assumptions act to isolate the causal mechanism modeled by the Substantial assumptions. Tractability assumptions simply the problem, e.g. assuming some function is linear or simple and so forth.</p>

<p>The act of establishing derivational robustness involves proving that the result attained from the Substantial assumptions holds under a variety of Galilean and Tractability assumptions. The authors provide an example from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_geography">Economic Geography</a> whereby a <a href="https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/261763">model is constructed by Paul Krugman</a> showing geographic concentration of firms under particular conditions about transportation costs and other factors. Further research has extended Krugman’s results to show that they hold under more general Galilean and Tractability assumptions. This lends credence that the models’ Substantial core captures the essential mechanisms involved in this economic process.</p>

<p>This article introduces the model extraction attack against deployed machine learning models. The goal of this attack is to reconstruct a model given oracle access to the model - a situation that’s common when <a href="https://tanzu.vmware.com/content/blog/scoring-as-a-service-to-operationalize-algorithms-for-real-time">machine learning models are deployed as a black box behind an API</a>. Often deployment platforms will return more information to users than just the predicted label (in the case of classification) or the predicted value (in the case of regression). In this paper, the authors explore extraction attacks in the setting where confidence scores are additionally returned to the user.</p>

<p><img width="50%" height="50%" src="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Fan_Zhang158/publication/308027534/figure/fig2/AS:667790147080206@1536224986492/Diagram-of-ML-model-extraction-attacks-A-data-owner.png"></p>

<p>To illustrate these sorts of attacks, consider the case of a binary logistic regression classifier with $n$ features. If confidence scores are provided, an adversary could fully reconstruct the model with $n+1$ (linearly independent) queries by solving a system of equations. The authors provide similar attacks with high (though not perfect) fidelity against multi-class logistic models, decision trees, and some neural networks.</p>

<p>This is a review of <a href="https://wwnorton.com/books/Economics-Rules/">Economics Rules</a> by <a href="https://drodrik.scholar.harvard.edu/">Dani Rodrik</a> by the economic theorist <a href="http://arielrubinstein.tau.ac.il/">Ariel Rubenstein</a>. Rubenstein is generally favorable to the book as it is written with non-economists in mind yet contains a substantive discussion of economic methodology. Rodrik argues that economics is a science since it uses models and he adopts a middle position between instrumentalism and realism on the status of models. The book is somewhat critical of economics education arguing for more pluralism.</p>

<p>At one point, Rubinstein goes on a tangent to discuss publishing in economics:</p>

<p>Why Ask Me AnyFin? At Code &amp; Pepper, we believe in testing assumptions and leaving no stone unturned when getting to the bottom of complex issues. But what are the right questions to ask? Well, that’s when things get really interesting… There is no one magic formula for a FinTech company. That’s why I’ve decided to sit down with founders, innovators and disruptors from different sub-sectors and with diverse backgrounds to look for the bigger picture: together.</p>

<h3 id="h-how-to-get-product-market-fit-right-and-not-lose-your-soul">How to get product-market fit right (and not lose your soul)?</h3>



<p><b>Adam Pogorzelski: You’ve just launched a FinTech startup called Lombi. You emphasize that Lombi is a response to an inefficient financial market, but what does it mean exactly?</b></p>



<p><b>Urszula Mścichowska-Mazurek</b>: Lombi.com is definitely a revolution, not only in Poland, but also on the European financial market. For the first time ever, we provide customers with money they don’t have to give back. In short, it’s non-refundable cash with home delivery. Could there be a better service?</p>



<p>Today, the customer has to go through an embarrassing scoring process and risk assessment, submit various documents and certificates. We want to revolutionize the market. </p>



<blockquote><p>In exchange for items left in deposit, Lombi provides cash with home delivery to everyone: rich or poor, with creditworthiness or not. </p><p>We don’t judge a person—only objects.</p></blockquote>



<p>Lombi delivers cash in return for more or less needed items, which we collect free of charge from the customer. Lombi doesn’t judge a person—only objects. This makes a huge difference. It is the customer who decides whether to return the money and recover the object or to extend the refund period. And clients can do it as many times as they want—or not give the money back, and then nothing happens.</p>



<blockquote><p>The client is not assessed, does not incur liabilities and will never be subject to debt collection.</p><p>For the first time in history, it is not the bank, but the <em>customer</em> who makes <em>all</em> decisions.</p></blockquote>



<p>People are the most important to us. As our claim says: “Lombi—you are all that counts”. It is a one-of-a-kind solution on the Polish and European market and, I dare say, also worldwide.</p>



<p><b>AP: I’m wondering what’s the role of technology in this process. You are talking about home cash delivery in exchange for objects. The customer basically doesn’t have to go anywhere, but cash has to be delivered home somehow and objects have to be physically collected. What’s happening on the technological side?</b></p>



<p><b>UMM</b>: Of course, Lombi.com is primarily a technology company. We use artificial intelligence, deep machine learning and blockchain technology.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Using the application on the website, the customer will be able to log in, select a few items, take three photos and upload them to the platform. Items are then assessed by our team: we send feedback and grant a given amount of money in return for the item left in deposit. Home cash delivery takes place physically through a network of our own representatives or through the cooperating courier companies. Our website and the dedicated application provide answers to all practical questions.</p>



<h3 id="h-cold-analysis-or-warm-heart-how-to-balance-values-in-business">Cold analysis or warm heart? How to balance values in business?</h3>



<p><b>AP: I suppose you’ve asked yourself this question more than once: why start a new business? On the other hand: what’s the best time to launch? Was it a matter of cold market analysis? Or maybe some circumstances made you think: this is what we need to do and <em>now</em> is the time to do it.</b></p>



<p><b>UMM</b>: Lombi.com was born out of the growing difficulties in obtaining traditional financing, both on the Polish market and in most European countries. </p>



<p>Why start a new business? In this case, it’s very important to me that I can do something meaningful for others. The financial industry is rarely perceived that way. Of course, Lombi is an enterprise, not a charity—but so very different from other companies operating in the market.</p>



<blockquote><p>Many people think that financial companies prey on their clients, but that’s not true and Lombi is a perfect example.</p><p>It’s very important to me that I can do something meaningful for others.</p></blockquote>



<p><b>AP: That’s an interesting approach. I suspect it’s based on a specific business model with such an <strong>“empathic” approach to customers</strong>. On the other hand, every company has to be solvent. How to balance that? Do you ever worry that it might be impossible to maintain a business model that is not 100% focused on profitability?</b></p>



<p><b>UMM</b>: This innovative solution responds perfectly to the needs of the customers and the market. </p>



<blockquote><p>Lombi.com is an answer to current troubles on the financial market and to the economic struggles of many customers.</p><p>It might come as a surprise, but such a financial model actually benefits the company as well.</p></blockquote>



<h3 id="h-how-to-deal-with-the-gender-gap-in-financial-technology">How to deal with the gender gap in financial technology?</h3>



<p><b>AP: My next question isn’t about finances, but rather about parities. According to the <a href="https://www.innovatefinance.com/if-news/female-founders-make-up-just-17-of-fintech-companies-and-women-receive-only-three-percent-of-vc-fintech-funding/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Innovate Finance 2019 report on Venture Capital Investment</a>, only 17% of all finance and technology companies have been founded by women. Why such disproportion in this sector?</b></p>



<p><b>UMM</b>: That’s an interesting question and I think I have an equally interesting answer.</p>



<p>Yes, the gender gap is real. Technology, innovation and finance are mainly associated with male activity. But the world is changing: women are more and more active in business. At least, that’s what it looks like in my business environment. </p>



<blockquote><p>Women have all it takes to develop a business or introduce groundbreaking financial solutions: </p><p>creativity, analytical thinking, precision, consistency, attention to detail and highly developed empathy, as well as the ability to recognize people’s needs.</p></blockquote>



<p>Why are only 17% of all FinTechs founded by women? Why don’t we rather ask: how many of these female-founded FinTechs have succeeded? In my opinion, there are more of them compared to successful FinTechs founded only by men. It might be a good idea to look at this issue from this perspective and <a href="https://www.bcg.com/en-us/publications/2018/why-women-owned-startups-are-better-bet" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">compare the success rate</a> of these FinTechs: companies founded by women versus companies run only by men.</p>



<p><b>AP: You’ve touched upon an important topic. Namely, that technology and financial indicators aren’t the only values in business. In other interviews, you’ve emphasized that <strong>emotions, empathy and social impact</strong> are equally important. How exactly do they help? Men would often state quite the opposite: emotions and empathy interfere with business.</b></p>



<p><b>UMM</b>: I think we can’t generalize and look in the same way at every business or service.</p>



<p>In the case of Lombi, I am confident to say that <strong>empathy has a big impact on the company’s success</strong>. Mostly because we interact directly with the client. Our salaries depend on clients’ interest in our service. The company wouldn’t exist without the customers. We must be open to people and their expectations. We need the right approach and that’s what makes empathy so important.</p>



<blockquote><p>Stepping into our clients’ shoes enables us to come up with the right solution. Then the relevance of our service is guaranteed. </p><p>You cannot distance yourself and rely on numbers alone, because without understanding the client, this business will simply fail.</p></blockquote>



<h3 id="h-how-can-advanced-tech-become-a-competitive-advantage">How can advanced tech become a competitive advantage?</h3>



<p><b>AP: The theme of technology returns in the next question. Could technology itself become a competitive advantage in this type of service? Do you think that technology and digital maturity are important factors, ensuring the success of a given project? Or are they secondary?</b></p>



<p><b>UMM</b>: Our FinTech, Lombi.com, is primarily a technology company. Advanced technology is our ticket to the European and even global markets. Lombi.com has at least a European outreach by design.</p>



<p>That’s why we have to rely on artificial intelligence, deep machine learning and blockchain technology. They are the solutions of tomorrow and we can’t ignore that fact. We have to move with the times and keep pace with new developments. </p>



<blockquote><p>Only thanks to such technologies as AI, ML and blockchain we can significantly reduce costs and influence the User Experience.</p><p>Without technology, we are not able to provide our service the way we plan, which is on the European and global arena.</p></blockquote>



<h3 id="h-how-to-build-trust-in-digital-financial-services">How to build trust in digital financial services?</h3>



<p><b>AP: Many people approach all financial services with prejudice. In this case, there is also the technological aspect. Even minor mistakes can make the user lose confidence in the service. This is a big risk in the FinTech industry. How are you planning to build trust among your potential customers?</b></p>



<p><b>UMM</b>: I believe that the service is so thoughtful and addresses the needs of customers and the market so well, that it inspires trust by definition. Web applications and digital tools are only intended to <em>support</em> the User Experience. The solution itself should be simple, intuitive and easy to follow; it’s supposed to guide the user through the application step by step.</p>



<p>Despite this technological environment, the client still feels the support of the company. Trust is built-in; the solution is so straightforward that there’s no reason to anticipate issues or feel threatened by the company.</p>



<blockquote><p>The system based on deep machine learning is constantly evolving and immediately reacts to any difficulties experienced by the users. </p><p>This approach reinforces and restores trust.</p></blockquote>

<h2>Why I Quit a $500K Job at Amazon to Work for Myself</h2>



<p>Last week I left my cushy job at Amazon after 8 years. Despite getting rewarded repeatedly with promotions, compensation, recognition, and praise, I wasn’t motivated enough to do another year.</p>



<p>I spent my entire time in AWS building tools for developers. I liked that field so much that I would have been satisfied working in it for the rest of my life.</p>



<p>I joined Amazon as an entry level developer. Within 3.5 years I had been promoted twice to a senior engineer, and I was practically guaranteed another promotion to principal engineer this year if I had stayed. My potential at the company was high, I was told.</p>



<p>My esteem within the company grew along the years and I was regarded an expert and a leader in my field. People looked up to me and respected me.</p>



<p>I made $75K in my first year and that gradually grew to $511K by my last year. I could have made another $1M if I stayed another couple of years.</p>



<p>My work–life balance was good too, despite Amazon’s reputation. I didn’t need to prove myself anymore, and I could get everything done in 40 hours a week. My team worked from home one day a week, and I rarely opened my laptop at night or weekends.</p>



<p>Also, the people I worked with were exceptional. I had three managers in total, and all were generous people with lots of empathy. I’m very grateful to everyone I worked with.</p>



<p>Everything was going well and getting better. But despite all this, my motivation to go to work each morning was decreasing—almost in an inverse trend to my career and income growth.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="576" src="https://i0.wp.com/danielvassallo.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/rewards_motivation-2340812862-1549830899929.png?resize=1024%2C576&amp;ssl=1" alt="Rewards up, motivation down." srcset="https://i0.wp.com/danielvassallo.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/rewards_motivation-2340812862-1549830899929.png?resize=1024%2C576&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/danielvassallo.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/rewards_motivation-2340812862-1549830899929.png?resize=300%2C169&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/danielvassallo.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/rewards_motivation-2340812862-1549830899929.png?resize=768%2C432&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/danielvassallo.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/rewards_motivation-2340812862-1549830899929.png?resize=1100%2C619&amp;ssl=1 1100w, https://i0.wp.com/danielvassallo.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/rewards_motivation-2340812862-1549830899929.png?w=1801&amp;ssl=1 1801w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption>Rewards up, motivation down.</figcaption></figure>



<p>It would have been foolish of me to expect my motivation to start increasing if I got yet another promotion, or another compensation bump, or another big project. But there was something else that was trending down with my motivation. It was my freedom.</p>



<h3>The Motivation Decline</h3>



<p>For the first couple of years my motivation was off the charts. I was mostly working with another person on an internal tool, and there was very little scrutiny around it. It was a time where I had a lot of independence in choosing how to work and what to work on—at least relative to more recent years.  It was just me and the other person improving this thing, talking to users, releasing updates, testing it, and everything else. Whatever we felt was important, we generally got to do. We did the best work we could for its own sake and we were mostly self-directed.</p>



<p>The last couple of years, however, were quite different. I was leading the most important project in the history of my department, with many stakeholders and complex goals. What I could do was always bounded by my ability to convince all the people involved that it was the best way to navigate our goals. </p>



<p>I was always going to be working on somebody else’s terms at Amazon. The terms were simple in the beginning (keep fixing the thing), but kept getting more complicated as the years passed by (maximize all goals; satisfy all stakeholders). Then there were other restrictions inherent to working in a large organization about how to do the work, what work to do, what goals to set, and what business was worth pursuing. This situation was squeezing me into doing things that I’d rather not do, and vice versa.</p>



<h3 id="mce_19">Finding New Motivation</h3>



<p>What kind of work would I do if I had to do it forever? Not something that I did until I reached some milestone (an exit), but something that I would consider satisfactory if I continued to do it until I’m 80. What is out there that I could do that would make me excited waking up every day for the next 45 years that could also earn me enough money to cover my expenses? Is that too unambitious? I don’t think so. Because there are two types of drivers that get me out of bed in the morning.</p>



<p>One comes from the outside in the form of a carrot or a stick. For instance, I’m not automatically driven to do my tax returns every April, but I make sure I do because I don’t want to go to prison. Or I might not want to work on something I dislike, but I do so anyway because I may need to pay the bills, or want to buy a fancy car. These are the extrinsic motivators.</p>



<p>The other comes from within. This is what drives me to do things when there isn’t a carrot or a stick. Hobbies are one activity driven by this. But what I was looking for was something that I could do for a living that was also driven by this type of motivation: the intrinsic kind.</p>



<p>Back to the question of whether this is too unambitious. See, I realized that extrinsic motivation doesn’t last. Whenever I got promoted, it felt good for a week, and then it was as over. When I first hit $100K income, I would take a peek at my W2 for a few days admiring the six digits, but then it wore off. When I hit $200K, $300K, $400K, and $500K, it was the same thing. I would be delusional to think that earning $1M, or $10M would suddenly make it different. And I feel the same with every other extrinsic reward or material possession. Getting them feels good for a while, but this wears off quickly.</p>



<p>The things that don’t wear off are those that I’ve been doing since I was a kid, when nothing was forcing me to do them. Things such as writing code, selling my creations, charting my own path, calling it like I saw it. I know my strengths, and I know what motivates me, so why not do this all the time? I’m lucky to live in a time where I can do something independently in my area of expertise without requiring large amounts of capital or outside investors. So that’s what I’m doing.</p>



<h3>What’s Next?</h3>



<p>I’m going all in on independence, and I’m going to try to make a living with my own bare hands starting from nothing. I don’t expect to only do things that I like, but it will be on my terms. My target is to cover my family’s expenses before I run out of savings while doing something that intrinsically motivates me. What more would I ever want to be satisfied with my work?</p>

    <h5>Posted on December 14, 2020</h5>
    

    <p><a href="https://sixtyfps.io/">SixtyFPS</a> is a new project aiming at making a UI toolkit.
            The <a href="https://sixtyfps.io/blog/introducing-sixtyfps.html">previous blog post</a> was introducing the project.
            This blog post explains, through a small tutorial, how to use SixtyFPS to create a small game.
        </p>

    <p>
        In this tutorial, we are going to demonstrate how to create a simple memory puzzle game with SixtyFPS.
        We are going to combine the
        <code>.60</code> language for the graphics with the game rules implemented in the Rust programming language.
        The SixtyFPS framework also supports other programming languages like <a href="https://sixtyfps.io/docs/cpp/readme">C++</a> or <a href="https://sixtyfps.io/docs/node/">JavaScript</a>.
        Update: we also published <a href="https://sixtyfps.io/blog/%3Ca%20href=" ..="" blog="" memory-game-tutorial-cpp.html"="">"&gt;a C++ version of this tutorial</a>
    </p>

    <p>
        The game consists of a grid of 16 rectangular tiles. When clicking on a tile, an icon underneath is uncovered.
        We know that there are 8 different icons in total, so each tile has a sibling somewhere in the grid with the
        same icon. The objective is to locate all icon pairs. Only two tiles can be uncovered at the same time. If they
        are not the same, then the icons will be obscured again. We need to remember under which tiles the matching
        graphics are hiding. If two tiles with the same icon are uncovered, then they remain visible - they are solved.
    </p>

<p> This is how the game looks like in action:</p>


<p>You can also <a href="https://sixtyfps.io/demos/memory/" target="_blank">play in your web browser</a>.
</p>

    <h3 id="getting-started">Getting Started</h3>

    <p>We assume that you are a somewhat familiar with Rust, and that you know how to create a Rust application with
        <code>cargo new</code>. The <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/learn/get-started">Rust Getting Started Guide"</a>
        can help you get set up.</p>


        <p>First, we create a new cargo project:</p>
<pre><code>cargo new memory
cd memory</code></pre>

        <p>Then we edit <code>Cargo.toml</code> to add the sixtyfps dependency:</p>

<pre><code>[dependencies]
sixtyfps = "0.0.4"
</code></pre>

    <p>Finally we copy the hello world program from the <a href="https://sixtyfps.io/docs/rust/sixtyfps/">SixtyFPS
            documentation</a> into our <code>src/main.rs</code>:</p>

<pre><code>sixtyfps::sixtyfps!{
    MainWindow := Window {
        Text {
            text: "hello world";
            color: green;
        }
    }
}
fn main() {
    MainWindow::new().run();
}
</code></pre>



    <h3 id="memory-tile">Memory Tile</h3>


    <p>
        With the skeleton in place, let's look at the first element of the game, the memory tile. It will be the
        visual building block that consists of an underlying filled rectangle background, the icon image. Later we'll add a
        covering rectangle that acts as a curtain. The background rectangle is declared to be 64 logical pixels wide and tall,
        and it is filled with a soothing tone of blue. Note how lengths in the <code>.60</code> language have a unit, here
        the <code>px</code> suffix. That makes the code easier to read and the compiler can detect when your're accidentally
        mixing values with different units attached to them.
    </p>

    <p>We copy the following code inside of the <code>sixtyfps!</code> macro:</p>

    <pre><code>MemoryTile := Rectangle {
    width: 64px;
    height: 64px;
    color: #3960D5;

    Image {
        source: img!"icons/bus.png";
        width: parent.width;
        height: parent.height;
    }
}

MainWindow := Window {
    MemoryTile {}
}
</code></pre>

<p>
    Inside the <code>Rectangle</code> we place an <code>Image</code>
    element that loads an icon with the <code>img!</code> directive. The path is
    relative to the folder in which the <code>Cargo.toml</code> is located. This icon and others we're going to
    use later need to be installed first. You can download a <a href="https://sixtyfps.io//blog/memory-game-tutorial/icons.zip">Zip
        archive</a> that we have prepared and
    extract it with the following two commands:</p>

<pre><code>curl -O https://sixtyfps.io/blog/memory-game-tutorial/icons.zip
unzip icons.zip</code></pre>

<p>
    This should unpack an <code>icons</code> directory containing a bunch of icons.
</p>



    <h3 id="memory-tiles">Polishing the Tile</h3>

    <p>
        Next, let's add a curtain like cover that opens up when clicking. We achieve this by declaring two rectangles
        below the <code>Image</code>, so that they are drawn afterwards and thus on top of the image.
        The <code>TouchArea</code> element declares a transparent rectangular region that allows
        reacting to user input such as a mouse click or tap. We use that to forward a signal to the <em>MainWindow</em>
        that the tile was clicked on. In the <em>MainWindow</em> we react by flipping a custom <em>open_curtain</em> property.
        That in turn is used in property bindings for the animated width and x properties. Let's look at the two states a bit
        more in detail:
    </p>

    <table>
        <thead>
            <tr>
                <th scope="col"><em>open_curtain</em> value:</th>
                <th scope="col">false</th>
                <th scope="col">true</th>
            </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
            <tr>
                <th>Left curtain rectangle</th>
                <td>Fill the left half by setting the width <em>width</em> to half the parent's width</td>
                <td>Width of zero makes the rectangle invisible</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <th>Right curtain rectangle</th>
                <td>Fill the right half by setting <em>x</em> and <em>width</em> to half of the parent's width</td>
                <td><em>width</em> of zero makes the rectangle invisible. <em>x</em> is moved to the right,
                    to slide the curtain open when animated</td>
            </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>
    
    <p>In order to make our tile extensible, the hard-coded icon name is replaced with an <em>icon</em>
        property that can be set from the outside when instantiating the element. For the final polish, we add a
        <em>solved</em> property that we use to animate the color to a shade of green when we've found a pair, later. We
        replace the code inside the <code>sixtyfps!</code> macro with the following:</p>

    <pre><code>MemoryTile := Rectangle {
    signal clicked;
    property &lt;bool&gt; open_curtain;
    property &lt;bool&gt; solved;
    property &lt;resource&gt; icon;

    height: 64px;
    width: 64px;
    color: solved ? #34CE57 : #3960D5;
    animate color { duration: 800ms; }

    
    Image {
        source: icon;
        width: parent.width;
        height: parent.height;
    }

    // Left curtain
    Rectangle {
        color: #193076;
        width: open_curtain ? 0px : (parent.width / 2);
        height: parent.height;
        animate width { duration: 250ms; easing: ease-in; }
    }

    // Right curtain
    Rectangle {
        color: #193076;
        x: open_curtain ? parent.width : (parent.width / 2);
        width: open_curtain ? 0px : (parent.width / 2);
        height: parent.height;
        animate width { duration: 250ms; easing: ease-in; }
        animate x { duration: 250ms; easing: ease-in; }
    }

    TouchArea {
        clicked =&gt; {
            // Delegate to the user of this element
            root.clicked();
        }
    }
}
MainWindow := Window {
    MemoryTile {
        icon: img!"icons/bus.png";
        clicked =&gt; {
            self.open_curtain = !self.open_curtain;
        }
    }
}</code></pre>

<p>Note the use of <code>root</code> and <code>self</code> in the code. <code>root</code> refers to the outermost
    element in the component, that's the <code>MemoryTile</code> in this case. <code>self</code> refers
    to the current element.</p>



    <h3>From One To Multiple Tiles</h3>


    <p>
        After modeling a single tile, let's create a grid of them. For the grid to be our game board, we need two features:
    
    </p><ol>
        <li>A data model: This shall be an array where each element describes the tile data structure, such as the
            url of the image, whether the image shall be visible and if this tile has been solved. We modify the model
            from Rust code.</li>
        <li>A way of creating many instances of the tiles, with the above <code>.60</code> markup code.</li>
    </ol>
    
    
    <p>
        In SixtyFPS we can declare an array of structures using brackets, to create a model. We can use the <code>for</code> loop to create many instances of the same element. In <code>.60</code> the
        for loop is declarative and automatically updates when the model changes. We instantiate all the different
        <code>MemoryTile</code> elements and place them on a grid based on their index with a
        little bit of spacing between the tiles.
    </p>
    
    <p>First, we copy the tile data structure definition and paste it at top inside the <code>sixtyfps!</code> macro:</p>

    <pre><code>sixtyfps::sixtyfps!{

// Added:
struct TileData := {
    image: resource,
    image_visible: bool,
    solved: bool,
}

MemoryTile := Rectangle {
// ...
        </code>
    </pre>

    <p>Next, we replace the <em><code>MainWindow</code> := { ... }</em> section
        at the bottom of the <code>sixtyfps!</code> macro with the following snippet:</p>

    <pre>        <code>MainWindow := Window {
    width: 326px;
    height: 326px;

    property &lt;[TileData]&gt; memory_tiles: [
       { image: img!"icons/at.png" },
       { image: img!"icons/balance-scale.png" },
       { image: img!"icons/bicycle.png" },
       { image: img!"icons/bus.png" },
       { image: img!"icons/cloud.png" },
       { image: img!"icons/cogs.png" },
       { image: img!"icons/motorcycle.png" },
       { image: img!"icons/video.png" },
    ];
    for tile[i] in memory_tiles : MemoryTile {
        x: mod(i, 4) * 74px;
        y: floor(i / 4) * 74px;
        width: 64px;
        height: 64px;
        icon: tile.image;
        open_curtain: tile.image_visible || tile.solved;
        // propagate the solved status from the model to the tile
        solved: tile.solved;
        clicked =&gt; {
            tile.image_visible = !tile.image_visible;
        }
    }
}</code></pre>

<p>
 The <code><span>for</span> tile[i] <span>in memory_tiles :</span></code> syntax
        declares a variable <code>tile</code> which contains the data of one element from the <code>memory_tiles</code> array,
        and a variable <code>i</code> which is the index of the tile. We use the <code>i</code> index to calculate the position
        of tile based on its row and column, using the modulo and integer division to create a 4 by 4 grid.
        </p>



<h3>Creating The Tiles From Rust</h3>

<p>The tiles in the game should have a random placement. We'll need to add the <code>rand</code> dependency to
    <code>Cargo.toml</code> for the randomization.</p>

<pre><code>[dependencies]
sixtyfps = "0.0.4"
rand = "0.7" # Added
</code></pre>

<p>What we'll do is take the list of tiles declared in the .60 language, duplicate it, and shuffle it.
    We'll do so by accessing the <code>memory_tiles</code> property through the Rust code. For each
top-level property, a getter and a setter function is generated - in our case <code>get_memory_tiles</code>
and <code>set_memory_tiles</code>. Since <code>memory_tiles</code> is an array in the .60
language, it is represented as a
<code>Rc&lt;dyn <a href="https://sixtyfps.io/docs/rust/sixtyfps/trait.model">sixtyfps::Model</a>&gt;</code>.
We can't modify the model generated by the .60, but we can extract the tiles from it, and put it
in a <code><a href="https://sixtyfps.io/docs/rust/sixtyfps/struct.vecmodel">VecModel</a></code> which
implements the <code>Model</code> trait. <code>VecModel</code> allows us to make modifications and we
can use it to replace the static generated model.
<br>
We modify the main …</p></div></section></div></div>

</header>
<p>With <a href="https://nyxt.atlas.engineer/article/release-2-pre-release-4.org">pre-release 4</a> we included a universal package manager interface in Nyxt. Thus far, it only supports <a href="https://guix.gnu.org/">Guix</a>. More package manager support will come in the future, contributions are welcome!</p>
<p>The package manager interface profits from the Nyxt minibuffer to allow for quick fuzzy-search and multi-selection actions.</p>
<p><img src="https://nyxt.atlas.engineer/static/image/article/describe-os-package.png"></p>

<p>One might wonder: why include a package manager interface in a web browser?</p>
<p>In short, a package manager allows us to integrate more easily with external programs and services. For instance, if we want to add an interface to IPFS, we can automatically install the required dependencies (after prompting the user of course).</p>
<p>With a functional package manager like Nix or Guix, it's even better, we can leverage the <code>nix-shell</code> and <code>guix environment</code> commands to run commands without installing them (i.e. without polluting the user environment).</p>

<p>Guix was the first interface we developed. This choice was made for two primary reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Being functional (in the mathematical sense), it is possibly the package manager with the broadest feature set. If our interface is complete enough to support Guix, then it's probably complete enough to support any other package manager.</p></li>
<li><p>Being written in Guile Scheme (which is a Lisp), we can naturally "talk" to Guix with no necessity for cumbersome language bindings or brittle shell output parsing.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>This last point is key:</p>
<p>Guix has a <code>guix repl</code> command, which is an interpreter (just like the one you'd get when running <code>sbcl</code> or <code>python</code>). Our approach is to start the interpreter, send it some Guile code and read the result.</p>
<p>To start the process, we use</p>

<p>Note that the <code>guix</code> process will automatically terminate when its input stream gets closed (which happens when Nyxt terminates).</p>
<p>To simplify, we can send instructions to the Guix REPL by writing Scheme code to the input stream:</p>

<p>Then we read the result with:</p>

<p>This should get us the current Guix version. It is really that easy!</p>
<p>Now this is where it gets mind blowing: we can write Guile Scheme code directly in our Common Lisp code base! While the syntax is similar, it's not completely interchangeable and the Common Lisp compiler will choke on some Guile Scheme symbols like <code>#t</code> and <code>#f</code> (true and false, respectively). The solution is to write reader macros. This is made easy thanks to the <a href="https://github.com/melisgl/named-readtables/">named-readtables</a> library which lets us effortlessly switch between Scheme and Common Lisp syntax whenever, and wherever we want.</p>
<p>This is what our function to list installed packages looks like:</p>

<p>Notice that it allows us to intertwine Common Lisp and Guile Scheme. We define a Common Lisp function which evaluates a bunch of Scheme expressions which themselves expand other Common Lisp expressions!</p>

<p>In addition to more package manager support (Nix, Dpkg, etc.), we would like to extend our Common Lisp "system" management to bring it under the same interface, thereby providing a uniform experience for the user (whether installing Lisp systems or system packages).</p>
<p><a href="https://www.quicklisp.org/beta/">Quicklisp</a> is a obvious target, and already partly implemented, but we are also considering <a href="https://www.clpm.dev/">CLPM</a> integration for the added benefit of full system version control.</p>
<p>Addendum: our experience with the Guix REPL has paved the way for more REPL interactions. This means that we are very close to implementing a universal REPL interface (à la Emacs' <code>comint-mode</code>). This means supporting interpreters from programming languages such as Guile, or Python, and giving the user the possibility to fiddle with foreign code from within the browser itself!</p>
<p>Thanks for reading!</p>

<p>Earlier to today, news of a leaked CCP database sent shockwaves around the world as we learned the names of 1.95 million Chinese communist party members. The <a href="https://electionwiz.com/2020/12/13/breaking-major-leak-exposes-chinese-communist-members-working-inside-western-companies/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://electionwiz.com/2020/12/13/breaking-major-leak-exposes-chinese-communist-members-working-inside-western-companies/">report</a> showed massive communist infiltration in Western firms and governments, including the United States. </p>



<p><strong><a href="realted: %E2%80%98major leak%E2%80%99 exposes Chinese Communist members working inside western companies">REALTED: ‘major leak’ exposes Chinese Communist members working inside western companies</a></strong></p>



<p>The database listed the names and information in Mandarin, but has since been translated to English. </p>







<p><strong>We now have the names in English…</strong></p>







<p>WARNING: this is a massive file and it is difficult to work with. Your operating system may not support it. </p>

The reverse proxy jails listen on the internet, while the applications
and databases communicate over a private network (dotted lines).

<h2>Firewall (<a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PF_%28firewall%29">pf</a>)
</h2>
<p>
This firewall configuration denies all traffic by default, and then allows what's needed.
It <span>assumes <code>xnic</code>
is on a public IP.</span> If not, remove its subnet from
the <code>&lt;martians&gt;</code> table.
</p>
<h3>Incoming traffic</h3>
<p>
Only the Nginx jail is open to the internet. SSHing to
the host or jails is only possible from IPs listed in the
<code>&lt;xpeers&gt;</code> table.
</p>
<details>
<summary>
<span>
<b>Rate Limits…</b>
</span>
</summary>
<p>
If an IP connects <a href="#-pf-max-src-conn-rate">100 times
within 10 seconds</a> it'll be blocked. Not only from making new
connections, but also from using established ones. That's why
the rule has <code>flush global</code>, which terminates them.
</p>
<p>
Effectively, that IP gets added to the <code>&lt;ratelimit&gt;</code> table. So
to reallow those IPs, use a cron. For example, to remove
IPs that are at least three minutes old from that table:
</p>
<pre><span>/sbin/</span><b>pfctl</b> -t ratelimit -T expire <span>180</span>
</pre>
<p>
<b>How to exclude a company from rate-limits?</b> Create a table with their
IPs. Then add a <code><span>pass</span>
in <b>quick</b></code> rule before the <code><span>block</span> in <b>quick</b></code> one. For
instance, if Cloudflare® is intercepting traffic, populate a <code>&lt;bypass&gt;</code> table with <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.cloudflare.com/ips/">their
IPs</a> and:
</p>
<pre><span>pass</span> in <b>quick</b> on <span>xnic</span> inet proto tcp from <span>&lt;bypass&gt;</span> to port 443
<i>block in quick …</i>
</pre>
</details>
<br>
<h3>Outgoing traffic</h3>
<p>    
The Node jail can reach <span>Stripe® API</span>
and <span>Fastmail®</span>. As they
need DNS services, Cloudflare® and Google® resolvers are allowed too.
</p>
<p>
NTP is allowed via <code>inic</code>
to <span>private NTP servers</span>.
</p>
<p>
<b>How to deploy to these servers?</b> Copy over to them with <code>rsync</code>.
The orchestration server IP must be in the <code>&lt;xpeers&gt;</code> table.
</p>
<p>
<b>How to generate Let's Encrypt certificates?</b> Like deploying.
See my previous post: <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://blog.uidrafter.com/engineering/isolated-tls-certificate-creation">Isolated
TLS Certificate Creation</a>.
</p>
<p>
<b>How to extract backups?</b> <code>rsync</code>
from the backup/orchestration server too.
</p>
<p><i>
The general answer to those questions is: initiate
the connection from the orchestration server.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The overwhelming majority of people do not seem to care about privacy. They ask why they should care if they have “nothing to hide”. Yet this idea of hiding is fundamentally flawed.</p>

<p>The United Nations <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_to_privacy" rel="nofollow">state</a> that privacy is a human right, just like the right to education is. So why on earth would you give that up? The famous (and somewhat obligatory) quote from Edward Snowden, the NSA whistleblower:</p>

<blockquote><p>Arguing that you don't care about the right to privacy because you have nothing to hide is no different than saying you don't care about free speech because you have nothing to say.</p></blockquote>

<p>The question about privacy is not about hiding, it is about sharing. It is not that I have nothing to hide, I just do not have anything I want to share, especially unknowingly.&nbsp;This whole narrative that privacy is only for nefarious people is pushed by those who quite clearly care alot about privacy. Mark Zuckerberg spent <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/oct/11/mark-zuckerberg-facebook-neighbouring-houses" rel="nofollow">tens of millions of dollars</a> buying the houses that surrounded his home, for example. The irony is painful.</p>

<p>We all care about our privacy, though we might not know it. It is why we lock the door when we go to the toilet; or why we close the curtains to stop people looking into our homes.</p>

<p>In her essay for Aeon Magazine, Carissa Véliz <a href="https://aeon.co/essays/privacy-matters-because-it-empowers-us-all" rel="nofollow">argued</a> that privacy is power. It is the power “to show you ads... and to predict your behaviour”. But it is also the power to influence. Increasingly, Big Tech, the likes of Facebook, Amazon and Microsoft, are sharing more and more information with governments. In turn, governments are starting to learn more and more about their citizens. Facebook allows governments to arrest people planning to participate in protests before they have even begun – and this is the tip of the iceberg.</p>

<p>Our privacy is eroding. As a society, we are beginning to accept this lack of privacy to be normal – and this is extremely dangerous. Privacy provides a place for us to be ourselves, to express ourselves in new ways without fear of being judged by preying eyes. If we lose privacy then we lose this ability to experiment, and, more importantly, we lose our power.</p>

<p>The war is not lost, however. We paved the path for Big Tech, though we no longer have to follow it. If we change our actions then a lot can be achieved. In most instances, alternatives to mainstream products, such as Google, are available. <a href="https://privacytools.io/" rel="nofollow">PrivacyTools.io</a> is a website, of which I am a team member, designed to showcase tools and knowledge to protect your privacy, along with housing a wonderful community of like minded privacy advocates. By simply switching to a few of the recommended services and installing some of the recommended add-ons we can slowly reverse the damage that was done. Furthermore, if you live in the EU, you can use your rights under GDPR to ensure all data that companies have on you is erased.</p>

<p>Privacy matters, regardless of who you are. We seriously need to start protecting it.</p>

December 14, 2020 | https://arpitbhayani.me/blogs/recursion-visualizer | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://arpitbhayani.me/blogs/recursion-visualizer">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>One programming paradigm, that is hardest to visualize, as almost every single programmer out there will agree on, is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recursion_(computer_science)">Recursion</a>. We usually use pen and paper to visualize the flow and check how recursion is behaving. But what if, this could be done programmatically, and today we address this very problem and try to come up with a simple yet effective solution.</p>
<p>This essay is going to be a little different from the usuals; instead of taking a look into a research paper or an algorithm, we will implement a simple and easy recursion visualizer for Python.</p>

<p>Recursion helps in solving a larger problem by breaking it into smaller similar ones. The classic implementation of recursion in the world of programming is when a function invokes itself using reduced parameters while having a base terminating condition.</p>
<pre><code><span><span>def</span> <span>fib</span><span>(n)</span>:</span>
  
  
  <span>if</span> n == <span>0</span>: <span>return</span> <span>0</span>
  <span>if</span> n == <span>1</span>: <span>return</span> <span>1</span>

  
  <span>return</span> fib(n - <span>1</span>) + fib(n - <span>2</span>)
</code></pre>
<p>The most common problem that is solved using recursion is computing the <code>n</code>th <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number">Fibonacci Number</a>. A trivial recursive Python function that spits out <code>n</code>th Fibonacci Number is as shown below</p>
<p>The most effective way of visualizing recursion is by drawing a recursion tree. It is very useful for visualizing what happens when a recurrence is iterated. The recursion tree for the above function <code>fib</code> for input <code>n = 3</code> is as illustrated below</p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4745789/102004754-74fb7980-3d39-11eb-991e-0f54fa7f20c6.png" alt="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4745789/102004754-74fb7980-3d39-11eb-991e-0f54fa7f20c6.png"></p>

<p>Instead of printing an actual tree-like recursion tree, we take some liberty and print a close-enough version of it running top-down. To keep track of recursive function calls we use <a href="https://realpython.com/primer-on-python-decorators/">Python Decorators</a> that essentially wraps the function allowing us to invoke statements before and after the function call.</p>
<p>The decorator that wraps the recursive function and prints the recursion tree is as illustrated below.</p>
<pre><code><span><span>def</span> <span>recviz</span><span>(fn)</span>:</span>
    <span>"""Decorator that pretty prints the recursion tree with
       args, kwargs, and return values.
    """</span>

    
    recursion_level = <span>1</span>

    <span><span>def</span> <span>wrapper</span><span>(*args, **kwargs)</span>:</span>

        
        
        
        
        <span>nonlocal</span> recursion_level

        
        fn_str = pretty_func(fn, args, kwargs)

        
        whitespace = <span>"   "</span> * (recursion_level - <span>1</span>)

        
        print(<span>f"<span>{whitespace}</span> -&gt; <span>{fn_str}</span>"</span>)

        
        recursion_level += <span>1</span>

        
        return_value = fn(*args, **kwargs)

        
        
        recursion_level -= <span>1</span>

        
        print(<span>f"<span>{whitespace}</span> &lt;- <span>{repr(return_value)}</span>"</span>)

        
        <span>return</span> return_value

    <span>return</span> wrapper
</code></pre>
<p>We use <code>recursion_level</code> to keep track of the current recursion level using which we decide the indentation. The value of this variable is increased every time we are about the invoke the function while it is reduced post the execution. In order to pretty-print the invoked function, we have a helper method called <code>pretty_func</code> whose implementation can be found <a href="https://github.com/arpitbbhayani/recviz/blob/master/src/recviz/rec.py">here</a>.</p>
<p>When we decorate our previously defined <code>fib</code> function and invoke it with <code>n = 3</code> we get the following output.</p>
<pre><code> -&gt; fib(<span>3</span>)
    -&gt; fib(<span>2</span>)
       -&gt; fib(<span>1</span>)
       &lt;- <span>1</span>
       -&gt; fib(<span>0</span>)
       &lt;- <span>1</span>
    &lt;- <span>2</span>
    -&gt; fib(<span>1</span>)
    &lt;- <span>1</span>
 &lt;- <span>3</span>
</code></pre>
<p>The above output renders how recurrence is evaluated and is pretty printed to make it more human-readable. The right arrow <code>-&gt;</code> defines a function invocation while the left arrow <code>&lt;-</code> indicates the return value post invocation.</p>
<h2>Publishing it on PyPI</h2>
<p>Everything mentioned above is published in a Python Package and hosted on <a href="https://pypi.org/">PyPI</a> at <a href="https://pypi.org/project/recviz/">pypi/recviz</a>. So in order to use this, simply install the package <code>recviz</code> like a usual Python package using <code>pip</code> and decorate the recursive function.</p>
<pre><code><span>from</span> recviz <span>import</span> recviz

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div> <p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/d78dbab29d26398c75c77857d5e0d4060c99086f/cb264/assets/img/2020/apple-silicon-ci/trippin.png"></p><p>Ever since the M1 was announced, I’ve been curious how well Apple’s new Mac mini would perform for our CI system. A few days ago we finally got access to two M1 Mac mini’s hosted on MacStadium (8-core M1, 16 GB unified memory, 1TB SSD, 1Gbs).</p><p>The Geekbench Score is 1705/7379 vs 1100/5465 so the promise is over 30% more performance, even more so for single-threaded operations Linking, code-signing are all tasks that Apple didn’t parallelize yet, so single-core performance is a significant factor for CI performance.</p><p>A recap: We run a raw Mac mini setup (6-core 3.2 GHz, 64 GB RAM, 1TB SSD, 10Gbs). I’ve explored <a href="https://pspdfkit.com/blog/2020/managing-macos-hardware-virtualization-or-bare-metal/">the tradeoffs between virtualization or bare metal in the PSPDFKit blog</a>.</p><h2 id="automization-woes">Automization Woes</h2><p>We’re using <a href="https://cinc.sh/">Cinc</a> (the open source binary package of <a href="https://www.chef.io/products/chef-automate">Chef</a>) + <a href="https://knife-zero.github.io/">knife zero</a> to automate the setup process for new nodes. It does everything from creating a ci user with an apfs-encrypted drive, configuring firewall rules, installing dependencies like <a href="https://pspdfkit.com/blog/2020/faster-compilation-with-ccache/">ccache for faster compiling</a> and Ruby for scripting, to installing Xcode and required Simulators. After a few hours, setup is complete and the machine automatically registers itself on Buildkite as new agent.</p><p>There’s a detailed article coming next in our <a href="https://pspdfkit.com/blog/2020/continuous-integration-for-small-ios-macos-teams/">series about Continuous Integration for Small iOS/macOS Teams</a> that goes into more detail on this setup. Of course, there have been a few issues along the way to make the automation work with Apple Silicon.</p><h2 id="installing-rosetta-2">Installing Rosetta 2</h2><p>The first thing you’ll need to do on the new machines is installing Rosetta to enable Intel emulation. This is curiously not default in Big Sur, but it only takes a few seconds via the terminal:</p><div><p><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
</pre></td><td><pre>/usr/sbin/softwareupdate --install-rosetta --agree-to-license
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></p></div><h2 id="cinc-for-darwinarm">Cinc for Darwin/ARM</h2><p>There’s no Chef or <a href="https://cinc.sh/start/client/">Cinc</a> release yet for Apple Silicon, which is both a blessing and a curse. It does make CI easier, since the Cinc client will run in x64 emulation mode, so anything it installs will also default to x64, which is slower but generally works.</p><p>Since the install script does platform detection, it will fail with an error as there’s no binary for Cinc yet available. To work around this, modify the <code>chef_full.erb</code> script in the <a href="https://github.com/chef/chef/blob/master/lib/chef/knife/bootstrap/templates/chef-full.erb">knife</a> gem and add <code>arch -x86_64</code> before the <code>sh $tmp_dir/install.sh</code> part. This will ensure the script detects Intel and will download the client.</p><p>Careful: The Chef/Cinc situation is tricky. Don’t mindlessly update the gems, as Chef is faster in releasing binaries, overriding all your Cinc binaries and then nothing works anymore unless you insert Dollars or manually remove all Chef gems. There’s also a quite messy <a href="https://twitter.com/steipete/status/1337712935418929154?s=21">randomness between what is renamed “cinc” and what is “chef”.</a></p><h2 id="apfs-containers">APFS Containers</h2><p>We automate diskutil to create a new encrypted volume for the ci user. This ensures that our source code is always encrypted. If hardware is replaced, the data is useless. We manually enter the disk password on a power cycle or when the OS reboots because of an update.</p><p>On Apple Silicon, the main APFS container is disk3 and not disk1. Currently this change is hardcoded, eventually I’ll modify the the script to parse <code>diskutil list</code> to detect the container automatically. It took me quite a while to understand why Cinc stopped with Error: -69493: You can’t add any more APFS Volumes to its APFS Container”. I mention it here so there’s <a href="https://twitter.com/steipete/status/1337711727023157249?s=21">at least one result on Google with this error.</a> 🙃</p><h2 id="detecting-apple-silicon-via-scripts">Detecting Apple Silicon via Scripts</h2><p>We use Buildkite as our CI agent, and they just recently released <a href="https://github.com/buildkite/agent/releases/tag/v3.26.0">3.26.0 with an experimental native executable for Apple Silicon</a>. It’s running on a pre-release version of Go, but so far it’s been stable.</p><p>There is no universal build, so the download script needs adjustment. To not hardcode this, I’ve been using a trick to detect the <em>real</em> architecture at runtime, since the script runs in Rosetta emulation mode and the usual ways would all report Intel.</p><p>Here’s the full block for Ruby, the interesting part is <code>sysctl -in sysctl.proc_translated</code>. It returns <code>0</code> if you run on arm, <code>1</code> if Rosetta 2, and NOTHING if you run on an Intel-Mac. Everything else is a dance to get the shell output back into Chef-flavored Ruby.</p><div><p><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1

</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></p></div><p>The best part: This will still work, even if we later switch to Cinc binaries that are native arm.</p><h2 id="xcode-troubles">Xcode Troubles</h2><p>I’ve experimented with using the “Release Candidate” of Xcode 12.3 as main Xcode version, however there’s currently <a href="https://twitter.com/steipete/status/1337738685282988032?s=21">a bug that prevents installing any non-bundled Simulators</a> (we still support iOS 12 in our <a href="https://pspdfkit.com/pdf-sdk/ios/">iOS PDF SDK</a>), which caused Cinc to stop with an error. For now we stay at Xcode 12.2, hoping that Apple fixes this soon. I assume this is a server-side error so it shouldn’t be hard to fix.</p><p>There’s <a href="https://twitter.com/steipete/status/1336428545791434752">a promising fix in Xcode 12.3</a> for “improved responsiveness of macOS mouse and keyboard events while under heavy load, such as when building a large project while running Simulator”, and a fix for <a href="https://twitter.com/steipete/status/1332348616145563653">random lockups of the CoreSimulator service</a>, so I’m itching to upgrade as soon as possible.</p><p><strong>Update:</strong> Apple fixed this issue server-side, list is loading now.</p><h2 id="test-troubles">Test Troubles</h2><p>Some features in our <a href="https://pspdfkit.com/pdf-sdk/ios/">iOS PDF SDK</a> use <code>WKWebView</code>, like <a href="https://pspdfkit.com/pdf-sdk/reader-view/#ios">Reader View that reflows PDFs so they are easier to read on mobile devices</a>. These tests <a href="https://steipete.com/posts/apple-silicon-m1-a-developer-perspective/">crash with a memory allocator error on Big Sur</a>.</p><p>If you see <a href="https://gist.github.com/steipete/7181cf321d979d734c5acd2326f6c33f"><code>bmalloc::HeapConstants::HeapConstants</code></a> in a crash stack trace, that’s likely this bug. While my radar has no reply yet, I’ve heard that this is a bug in Big Sur and requires an OS update to be fixed, so this potentially will be resolved in 10.2 some time in Q1 2021.</p><p>I’ve currently worked around this by detecting Rosetta at runtime and then skipping any tests that calls into WebKit using this snippet to detect execution state:</p><div><p><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1

</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></p></div><h2 id="memory-is-tight">Memory Is Tight</h2><p>We’ve been running 6 parallel instances of our tests (one per core) on Intel via the <code>-parallel-testing-worker-count</code> option. To make things work well for the M1 chip I reduced the workload to 4 instances. There’s really only 4 fast cores, and 4 low-power cores, which perform badly and cause various issues with timeouts in tests. The machine also starts swapping too much memory, as the 16 GB really aren’t all that much. Reducing the number to 4 seems to be the best solution to get both more predictable test results and a faster result.</p><h2 id="breaking-out-of-rosetta">Breaking Out of Rosetta</h2><p>Even though our Buildkite agent runs natively, I missed that Cinc installs an Intel-version of Ruby (via <code>asdf</code>), and we use Ruby to script CI and parse test results. The Intel-Ruby kicks off <code>xcodebuild</code>, which then also runs in emulation mode because we’re already in an emulation context.</p><p>I’ve tried switching to arm-based Ruby. The latest version 2.7.2 does support compiling to arm, but there’s still many gems that use native dependencies that haven’t been updated yet. Realistically, it will take a while until we can switch to native Ruby there.</p><p>Luckily there’s a way to break out: I’ve been prefixing the <code>xcodebuild</code> command with <code>arch -arm64e</code> to enforce the native context. This is currently hardcoded in a branch, and I’ll use a similar trick to detect the native architecture as in the Ruby script above. Sadly there’s no <code>arch -native</code> command that would do this for us.</p><p>This is important! <a href="https://twitter.com/steipete/status/1338152854662549509?s=21">Performance is really terrible</a> if Clang runs in Intel-emulation mode.</p><h2 id="launchctl-weirdness">launchctl Weirdness</h2><p>I’ve encountered a few other weird issues. <code>launchctl</code> changed a bit in Big Sur and now throws <a href="https://twitter.com/steipete/status/1338155208044638210?s=21">“Bootstrap failed: 125: Unknown error: 125”</a> or “ Load error 5: input/output error” if the service is already running. This again had no Google results, so it took a good bit to understand. Sometimes it would also write “Disk I/O error 5 or Load error 5: input/output error” which caused me to request a complete reset of the machine with MacStadium, only to see the same error many hours later again.</p><p>In our case the fix was to explicitly unload the Buildkite service before registering it again - this only did show up since the automation script stopped half way due to my various tweaks. It is also important that you are logged in as the user you’re registering the service for (via screen sharing)</p><h2 id="results">Results</h2><p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/287e32dc7fbf87a5eac2d87ec78325b00c85f9e5/778bf/assets/img/2020/apple-silicon-ci/buildkite.png" alt="Buildkite Test Results"></p><p>The M1 runs our tests around 10% faster on iOS 14. Tests on older versions of iOS are <a href="https://twitter.com/steipete/status/1338219014338850816?s=21">around 30-70% slower</a>, since the Simulator runs via Rosetta’s emulation mode. Results range from 7-9 minutes vs 5 minutes on Intel.</p><p>I’ve also seen <a href="https://twitter.com/steipete/status/1338152854662549509?s=21">Rosetta bugs in the logs, which caused tests to fail</a>. Twitter birds tell me that the Big Sur 11.1 comes with many fixes to Rosetta, so this seems like a transitionary issue.</p><p>The machines are marginally cheaper to host (129$/month vs 159$/month on MacStadium) but are still only on limited availability (<a href="https://twitter.com/steipete/status/1337170464460988417?s=21">we only got 2 even though we ordered 5</a>) and software is still experimental. There’s currently more problems than benefits in updating your fleet to M1, especially if you need to support versions below iOS 14.</p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/steipete/status/1333809139190034433?s=21">My Twitter research</a> thread contains a few more details, and various stages …</p></div></div>

      <p>Die Innenminister der EU-Mitgliedsstaaten haben die heftig umstrittenen Schlussfolgerungen zu "Sicherheit durch VerschlÃ¼sselung und Sicherheit trotz VerschlÃ¼sselung" des Rats bei ihrer virtuellen Sitzung am Montag ohne weitere Aussprache angenommen. Sie billigten damit trotz massiver Proteste aus Wirtschaft, Wissenschaft und Zivilgesellschaft den finalen Entwurf der deutschen, Ende des Jahres auslaufenden RatsprÃ¤sidentschaft.</p>

<h3 id="nav_umstrittene__0">Umstrittene HintertÃ¼ren und GeneralschlÃ¼ssel</h3>
<p>Kernpunkt der <a href="https://data.consilium.europa.eu/doc/document/ST-13084-2020-REV-1/en/pdf" rel="external noopener" target="_blank">endgÃ¼ltigen Version vom 24. November</a> ist der Gedanke, dass fÃ¼r SicherheitsbehÃ¶rden eine Form des auÃŸergewÃ¶hnlichen Zugriffs auf verschlÃ¼sselte Daten im Klartext mÃ¶glich sein sollte und kÃ¶nnte. Diese Idee haben unter anderem Geheimdienste wie die NSA und das GCHQ Ã¼ber den sogenannten Five-Eyes-Verbund sowie das FBI <a href="https://www.heise.de/hintergrund/Missing-Link-Crypto-Wars-der-endlose-Streit-ueber-sichere-Verschluesselung-4967574.html">in den laufenden Crypto Wars</a> propagiert.</p>
<p>Grundlegende SicherheitsmÃ¤ngel fÃ¼r alle anderen Nutzer eines Dienstes oder einer Technologie sollen laut der seit Jahren gefÃ¼hrten Debatte Ã¼ber Vorder- und HintertÃ¼ren sowie Universal- oder NachschlÃ¼ssel nach offizieller Lesart nicht geschaffen werden. Techniker verweisen eine solche "magische LÃ¶sung" aber ins Reich der MÃ¤rchen, da es "ein bisschen verschlÃ¼sselt" nicht gibt.</p>

  <a-script name="132" needs-consent="" src="https://a.teads.tv/page/86789/tag"></a-script>
  


<h3 id="nav_gesellschaft__1">Gesellschaft und BÃ¼rger "auch online schÃ¼tzen"</h3>
<p>Der Rat will nun trotzdem <a href="https://www.heise.de/news/Crypto-Wars-Deutsche-EU-Ratspraesidentschaft-will-Beihilfe-zur-Entschluesselung-4940927.html">auf die Beihilfe von Dienstanbietern wie Apple, Facebook, Google, Threema, Signal oder WhatsApp beim EntschlÃ¼sseln elektronischer Kommunikation</a> setzen. "VerschlÃ¼sselung ist ein notwendiges Mittel zum Schutz der Grundrechte und der digitalen Sicherheit von Regierungen, Industrie und Gesellschaft", <a href="https://www.consilium.europa.eu/de/press/press-releases/2020/12/14/encryption-council-adopts-resolution-on-security-through-encryption-and-security-despite-encryption/" rel="external noopener" target="_blank">heiÃŸt es in der EntschlieÃŸung</a>. Gleichzeitig mÃ¼sse die EU aber sicherstellen, dass die "zustÃ¤ndigen BehÃ¶rden im Bereich Sicherheit und Strafjustiz" â€“ inklusive Geheimdiensten â€“ ihre "gesetzlichen Befugnisse" ausÃ¼ben und "sowohl online als auch offline unsere Gesellschaften" und BÃ¼rger schÃ¼tzen kÃ¶nnen.</p>

  
    <a-script name="488" needs-consent="" src="https://widgets.opinary.com/embed.js"></a-script>
  





<p>Diese ZwiespÃ¤ltigkeit, die schon im Titel der Resolution angelegt ist, zieht sich durch das ganze Dokument. "Ganz offensichtlich kommen VerschlÃ¼sselungstechnologien allen Seiten zugute", meinen die Regierungsvertreter. "Es werden nicht nur elektronische GerÃ¤te und Anwendungen zunehmend so programmiert, dass sie gespeicherte Nutzerdaten standardmÃ¤ÃŸig verschlÃ¼sseln". Auch immer mehr KommunikationskanÃ¤le und Datenspeicherdienste wÃ¼rden durch Ende-zu-Ende-VerschlÃ¼sselung gesichert.</p>

<h3 id="nav__quot_rechtmÃ¤ÃŸig__2">"RechtmÃ¤ÃŸiger Zugang" fÃ¼r BehÃ¶rden per Gesetz nÃ¶tig</h3>
<p>Die Digitalisierung moderner Gesellschaften bringt laut der Deklaration aber auch "gewisse Schwachstellen und das Potenzial einer Ausbeutung fÃ¼r kriminelle Zwecke mit sich". So kÃ¶nnten StraftÃ¤ter "leicht zugÃ¤ngliche, herkÃ¶mmliche VerschlÃ¼sselungslÃ¶sungen, die fÃ¼r rechtmÃ¤ÃŸige Zwecke konzipiert sind, fÃ¼r ihre Vorgehensweisen nutzen". Gleichzeitig hÃ¤nge die Strafverfolgung zunehmend vom Zugang zu elektronischen Beweismitteln ab, um Terrorismus, organisierte KriminalitÃ¤t, sexuellen Missbrauch von Kindern sowie eine Vielzahl anderer Cyberstraftaten wirksam zu bekÃ¤mpfen.</p>
<p>UnabhÃ¤ngig vom derzeitigen technologischen Umfeld ist es dem Rat zufolge daher unerlÃ¤sslich, die Befugnisse der zustÃ¤ndigen BehÃ¶rden "durch rechtmÃ¤ÃŸigen Zugang zu wahren". NÃ¶tig seien gegebenenfalls Gesetze, mit denen diese auf dem Papier schon bestehenden Kompetenzen auch praktisch durchgesetzt werden kÃ¶nnten. Diese mÃ¼ssten "im vollen Einklang mit einem ordnungsgemÃ¤ÃŸen Verfahren und anderen Garantien sowie den Grundrechten stehen". Die unterschiedlichen Interessen seien sorgfÃ¤ltig abzuwÃ¤gen.</p>
<h3 id="nav_einheitliche__3">Einheitliche technische LÃ¶sung wohl nicht machbar</h3>
<p>Die EU zeigt sich laut der ErklÃ¤rung nun bestrebt, "in einen aktiven Dialog mit der Technologiebranche einzutreten und dabei Forschung und Wissenschaft einzubeziehen". Dabei gelte es, einerseits den Einsatz starker VerschlÃ¼sselungstechnologien und die Cybersicherheit zu gewÃ¤hrleisten. Andererseits mÃ¼ssten SicherheitsbehÃ¶rden "unter uneingeschrÃ¤nkter Achtung der Grundrechte und der einschlÃ¤gigen Datenschutzgesetze rechtmÃ¤ÃŸig und gezielt auf Daten zugreifen kÃ¶nnen". DafÃ¼r seien grundrechtskompatible "technische LÃ¶sungen" nÃ¶tig.</p>
<p>Vage wird in dem Papier festgehalten, dass die Notwendigkeit, einen entsprechenden EU-weiten Regelungsrahmen zu entwickeln, weiter bewertet werden "kÃ¶nnte". Dies soll offenbar nahelegen, dass eine zusÃ¤tzliche Analyse nicht mehr zwingend fÃ¼r kÃ¼nftige gesetzgeberische Schritte nÃ¶tig ist. Es sei vor allem wichtig, die BemÃ¼hungen aller LÃ¤nder, Organe und Institutionen der EU zu bÃ¼ndeln. Eine "einheitliche vorgeschriebene technische LÃ¶sung fÃ¼r den Zugang zu verschlÃ¼sselten Daten" sieht der Rat aber als nicht machbar an.</p>
<h3 id="nav_kaum__4">Kaum verÃ¤nderter Entwurf trotz Kritik beschlossen</h3>
<p>Die Bundesregierung hatte mit frÃ¼heren EntwÃ¼rfen eine <a href="https://www.heise.de/news/Terrorbekaempfung-und-Verschluesselung-EU-Rat-forciert-umstrittene-Crypto-Linie-4960069.html">Welle der Kritik ausgelÃ¶st</a>, zuletzt aber nur noch Nuancen am Text geÃ¤ndert. Das Innenministerium <a href="https://www.heise.de/news/Crypto-Wars-Bundesregierung-verteidigt-EU-Linie-zur-Entschluesselung-4984108.html">verteidigt den Kurs damit</a>, dass der Einsatz von Staatstrojanern zum Umgehen von VerschlÃ¼sselung zu aufwÃ¤ndig und so meist nicht praktikabel sei. Unter anderem die Datenschutzkonferenz von Bund und LÃ¤ndern hatte die Zugriffsforderungen entschieden zurÃ¼ckgewiesen. Die "AushÃ¶hlung von VerschlÃ¼sselungslÃ¶sungen", wie sie der Ratsbeschluss nahelege, sei kontraproduktiv und kÃ¶nnte durch Kriminelle und Terroristen leicht umgangen werden. Die Gesellschaft fÃ¼r Informatik hatte beklagt: Die Initiative gefÃ¤hrde nicht nur die informationelle Selbstbestimmung, sondern auch den Schutz von Betriebs- und GeschÃ¤ftsgeheimnissen.</p>
<p>Die EU-Kommission <a href="https://www.heise.de/news/Anti-Terror-Agenda-EU-Kommission-sucht-Mittelweg-gegen-Verschluesselung-4985264.html">hat sich mit ihrer Anti-Terror-Agenda bereits hinter die RatserklÃ¤rung gestellt</a>. Sie will nun vor allem im Kampf gegen die Verbreitung von Missbrauchsdarstellungen <a href="https://www.heise.de/news/EU-Kommission-Mit-Hashabgleich-und-TPM-gegen-Ende-zu-Ende-Verschluesselung-4889729.html">LÃ¶sungen fÃ¼r den Zugang zu Nachrichten im Klartext ausloten</a>, die <a href="https://www.heise.de/news/Bundestagsstudie-EU-Vorschlag-zum-Umgehen-von-Verschluesselung-taugt-nicht-4980983.html">IT-Sicherheitsexperten aber bislang als untauglich einschÃ¤tzen</a>. HintertÃ¼ren schlieÃŸt sie bei dem von ihr fÃ¼r mÃ¶glich erachteten "Mittelweg" nicht aus. Europol betreibt schon eine <a href="https://www.heise.de/meldung/Crypto-Wars-Europol-soll-Europas-Ermittlern-bei-Entschluesselung-helfen-3914261.html">Plattform zur EntschlÃ¼sselung</a> nach dem Vorbild der deutschen HackerbehÃ¶rde Zitis.</p>

The answer to this questions should be one that you know, and you can provide with certainty and authentic conviction. Make use of the elevator pitch, excite the investor with an engaging answer that sparks their curiosity to learn more.</p> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div> <p>Why did you pick this idea to work on?</p> </div>  </div> <div> <div> <div data-id="pwj5nk" data-type="inner-row"> <div data-id="pzojfp" data-type="column"> <div data-id="pw9bdv" data-type="heading">  <div> <p>Again, keep your questions short and to the point during investor meetings. This is a great opportunity to explain your motivation as to why you are working on this. Make sure to convey clear reasons and back them up with some domain expertise or background experience that makes you the perfect team to work on this idea. don’t forget to express your enthusiasm and excitement your cary within to be bring this idea to life. Investors like to hear that you are passionate about what you do.</p> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div>  <div> <div> <div data-id="pfrdpb" data-type="inner-row"> <div data-id="p76drh" data-type="column"> <div data-id="pcqqvd" data-type="heading">  <div> <p>The investor likes to know if you can prove that you have a truly unique value proposition. You have been working on this idea for a while now and did your research, you should definitely be able to explain properly how you differ from others in the market. First of all, express how you and your team are different than any other team to execute on this. Explain the in-house expertise, motivation, and amazing team collaboration to achieve results. Second, you found a unique solution to the customer’s problem through innovative (proprietary) technology, product development, or service offering unlike anything in the market today.</p> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div> <p>What big problem do you solve?</p> </div>  </div> <div> <div> <div data-id="p5m277" data-type="inner-row"> <div data-id="p729kq" data-type="column"> <div data-id="pwq1v6" data-type="heading">  <div> <p>When an investor asks you this question, get ready to emphasize clearly that the problem your solving is HUGE! You are on a mission to solve a problem that will change the way people do certain things and it will have a tremendous impact. Make sure to state some short key facts why this true so you’re not just blowing this up. The reason why you want to answer it in this way, is because the bigger the problem, the more likely people are willing to pay.</p> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div> <p>What is unique about the company?</p> </div>  </div> <div> <div> <div data-id="pswh74" data-type="inner-row"> <div data-id="pt3l1o" data-type="column"> <div data-id="prc0cw" data-type="heading">  <div> <p>Although this question ties in closely with “how are you different?” they are not entirely the same question. This is your opportunity to really focus on what makes your company unique. It might be your proprietary innovative technology that makes your company unique. It could be that your team has amazing set of skills unlike any other team. Or, it could be that your company strategized towards problems and opportunities just a bit different than others. Focus, focus, focus – let them know that <i>you know</i> what is unique about your company.</p> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div> <p>Why is your business defensible?</p> </div>  </div> <div> <div> <div data-id="pc026o" data-type="inner-row"> <div data-id="pg1ie5" data-type="column"> <div data-id="pf29xp" data-type="heading">  <div> <p>The investor is looking for some reassurance that your business and product/service is not one that will be copied easily. You defensibility could be your go-to-market strategy or scaling strategy. Defensibility could also come from the team you assemble or the technology you are building. Explain how your business is one that can’t be easily copied and executed. Even if the idea can be copied by another company, they will not have the team you have to execute successfully.

However, do not lie or give vague answers as to when you expect profits. This will only complicate things later and will make you look like you failed when you don’t reach those conversions.

              <div>
              <p>Developers spend most of their time reading code, understanding it and exploring other ways to use existing solutions. Frankly, in our profession, there is very little time on actually writing new libraries and creating new interfaces in real-life development. So it is quite important to have some help in the most common activities. <strong>Naming conventions</strong> is one such thing that improves readability and eases the usage cost if agreed upon and spread worldwide.</p>
<p>Some languages have their own special naming conventions that make sense. Haskell is among them. There are a bunch of naming patterns that are commonly used everywhere in the ecosystem (including the standard libraries) that may help you to recognise the function’s meaning without looking at its documentation and even its type! This ability is especially relevant because naming is one of the hardest development problems, so having some help and no-brainer rules to guide in this area improves everyone’s life.</p>
<p>In this post, we will explore common naming conventions in Haskell together. It is going to be useful for both creators (library and API developers) and consumers (library users), as it establishes norms accepted in the libraries’ APIs.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>🦋 If you are interested in other conventions and best practices on how to write Haskell code, you can take a look at our <a href="https://kowainik.github.io/posts/2019-02-06-style-guide">style guide</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="checked">Checked<a href="#checked">🔗</a></h2>
<p>Let’s start with the conventional and straightforward norms established in Haskell’s specifications and standards. Names in Haskell must satisfy the following simple rules:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Types and typeclasses</strong> must start with an <em>uppercase</em> letter</li>
<li><strong>Functions and variables</strong> must start with a <em>lowercase</em> letter</li>
<li><strong>Top-level operator functions</strong> must start with any allowed symbol except for <code>:</code></li>
<li><strong>Constructors as operators</strong> must start with <code>:</code></li>
</ul>
<p>These rules are in the specifications and therefore checked by the compiler. So if you try to break the naming rules, you will get errors during the compilation.</p>
<p>Additionally, functions follow the <strong>lowerCamelCase</strong> style and types follow the <strong>UpperCamelCase</strong> style. This is the de facto standard of writing code in Haskell, but using distinct styles doesn’t lead to a compiler error. Moreover, there are some testing libraries that use <em>snake_case </em>to discover tests automatically. However, you can restrict that with the Haskell tooling, e.g.&nbsp;HLint can check this for you.</p>

<p>There are various details in the names that will give you hints on what the function does. We will walk through them to learn to recognise them all.</p>
<h2 id="type-variables">Type variables<a href="#type-variables">🔗</a></h2>
<p>Let’s start our excursions with the type variables that are most commonly used in type signatures and definitions. Some variables represent particular meaning: it could be a typeclass-related convention or just a convenient shorter usage. But in any way, this information is useful to know while reading and writing types:</p>
<div>
<p><code>a</code>, <code>b</code>, <code>c</code>, …</p>
<div>
<p>Ordinary type variables with no particular meaning</p>
<div id="cb1"><pre><code><span id="cb1-1"><span>map</span><span> ::</span> (a <span>-&gt;</span> b) <span>-&gt;</span> [a] <span>-&gt;</span> [b]</span></code></pre></div>
</div>
<p><code>f</code></p>
<div>
<p><code>Functor</code> or <code>Applicative</code></p>
<div id="cb2"><pre><code><span id="cb2-1"><span>fmap</span><span> ::</span> <span>Functor</span> f <span>=&gt;</span> (a <span>-&gt;</span> b) <span>-&gt;</span> f a <span>-&gt;</span> f b</span></code></pre></div>
</div>
<p><code>m</code></p>
<div>
<p><code>Monad</code> or <code>Semigroup</code>/<code>Monoid</code></p>
<div id="cb3"><pre><code><span id="cb3-1"><span>(&gt;&gt;=) ::</span> <span>Monad</span> m <span>=&gt;</span> m a <span>-&gt;</span> (a <span>-&gt;</span> m b) <span>-&gt;</span> m b</span>

</div>
<p><code>e</code></p>
<div>
<p>Types representing errors</p>

<p><code>Foldable</code> or <code>Traversable</code></p>
<div id="cb5"><pre><code><span id="cb5-1"><span>concat</span><span> ::</span> <span>Foldable</span> t <span>=&gt;</span> t [a] <span>-&gt;</span> [a]</span></code></pre></div>
<p>or types of kind <code>Type</code> (previously <code>*</code>)</p>

<div id="cb7"><pre><code><span id="cb7-1"><span>type</span> <span>family</span> (<span>++</span>) (<span>xs ::</span> [k]) (<span>ys ::</span> [k])<span> ::</span> [k]</span></code></pre></div>
</div>
</div>
<h2 id="function-variables">Function variables<a href="#function-variables">🔗</a></h2>
<p>The way we name arguments and variables in functions is also not accidental. They contain hints that make reading these variables used in function bodies easier. Variables in functions use the following established commonly used names:</p>
<div>
<p><code>l</code></p>
<p>Lists variable</p>
<p><code>(x:xs)</code> or <code>(y:ys)</code></p>
<div>
<p>Patterns for lists where <code>x</code> means a single x and <code>xs</code> means <em>many <code>x</code>s</em></p>
<p>Also used together with the previous one with as-patterns:</p>

</div>
<p><code>f</code>, <code>g</code>, <code>h</code></p>
<div>
<p>Function arguments</p>
<div id="cb9"><pre><code><span id="cb9-1"><span>map</span> f (x<span>:</span>xs) <span>=</span> f x <span>:</span> <span>map</span> f xs</span></code></pre></div>
</div>
<p><code>p</code></p>
<div>
<p>Functions which are predicates (e.g.&nbsp;of type <code>Int -&gt; Bool</code>)</p>
<div id="cb10"><pre><code><span id="cb10-1"><span>bar ::</span> (<span>Int</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Bool</span>) <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Int</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Maybe</span> <span>Int</span></span>
<span id="cb10-2">bar p i <span>=</span> <span>...</span></span></code></pre></div>
</div>
<p><code>n</code>, <code>i</code>, <code>j</code>, <code>k</code></p>
<p>Miscellaneous counters</p>
<p><code>len</code></p>
<p>Container size</p>
<p><code>go</code></p>

</div>
<h2 id="suffixes">Suffixes<a href="#suffixes">🔗</a></h2>
<p>Suffix in a Haskell function can contain a lot of information about its purpose. Sometimes you would see multiple different suffixes simultaneously that combine the characteristics of each piece, so it is helpful to pay attention to that.</p>
<h4 id="apostrophe">Apostrophe ’<a href="#apostrophe">🔗</a></h4>
<p>The <code>'</code> symbol is used in the functions, for which there is a corresponding function without the apostrophe, e.g.&nbsp;<code>foo</code> and <code>foo'</code>.</p>
<p>The apostrophe at the end means that it’s a <strong>strict</strong> version of a similar function. Both functions must have the same type, but different implementations underneath. The only difference in their behaviour is that the one with the <code>'</code> symbol evaluates intermediate results more eagerly.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<div id="cb11"><pre><code><span id="cb11-1"><span>foldMap</span><span>  ::</span> (<span>Foldable</span> t, <span>Monoid</span> m) <span>=&gt;</span> (a <span>-&gt;</span> m) <span>-&gt;</span> t a <span>-&gt;</span> m</span>
<span id="cb11-2"><span>foldMap' ::</span> (<span>Foldable</span> t, <span>Monoid</span> m) <span>=&gt;</span> (a <span>-&gt;</span> m) <span>-&gt;</span> t a <span>-&gt;</span> m</span></code></pre></div>
<p>As you can see, both functions have the same type. But <code>foldMap'</code> is more efficient and helps to avoid space leaks when monoidal operation <code>&lt;&gt;</code> is strict in both arguments.</p>
<h3 id="typeclasses">Typeclasses<a href="#typeclasses">🔗</a></h3>
<p>There is a group of symbols that is used to indicate that the function returns the value in some context. This suffix – an uppercase letter or word – tells us the typeclass this context should represent.</p>
<p>Meet the <code>FAM</code>ily 👩‍👩‍👦‍👦</p>
<h4 id="f">F<a href="#f">🔗</a></h4>
<p>The suffix <code>F</code> suggests that it works with <code>Functor</code>s in some way.</p>
<p>Such functions can have an alternative without the suffix <code>F</code>.</p>
<p>Example from the <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/containers">containers</a> library:</p>
<div>
<div>
<div id="cb12"><pre><code><span id="cb12-1">alter</span>
<span id="cb12-2"><span>    ::</span> <span>Ord</span> k</span>
<span id="cb12-3">    <span>=&gt;</span> (<span>Maybe</span> a <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Maybe</span> a)</span>
<span id="cb12-4">    <span>-&gt;</span> k</span>
<span id="cb12-5">    <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Map</span> k a</span>
<span id="cb12-6">    <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Map</span> k a</span></code></pre></div>
</div>
<div>
<div id="cb13"><pre><code><span id="cb13-1">alterF</span>
<span id="cb13-2"><span>    ::</span> (<span>Functor</span> f, <span>Ord</span> k)</span>
<span id="cb13-3">    <span>=&gt;</span> (<span>Maybe</span> a <span>-&gt;</span> f (<span>Maybe</span> a))</span>
<span id="cb13-4">    <span>-&gt;</span> k</span>
<span id="cb13-5">    <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Map</span> k a</span>
<span id="cb13-6">    <span>-&gt;</span> f (<span>Map</span> k a)</span></code></pre></div>
</div>
</div>
<p>However, sometimes the suffix <code>F</code> has an alternative meaning. <code>F</code> frequently used as a suffix in formatting libraries to indicate that a function is a <em>formatter</em> or a <em>pretty-printer</em>.</p>
<p>Example from the <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/fmt">fmt</a> library:</p>
<div id="cb14"><pre><code><span id="cb14-1"><span>timeF ::</span> <span>FormatTime</span> a <span>=&gt;</span> <span>Text</span> <span>-&gt;</span> a <span>-&gt;</span> <span>BuilderSource</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>You can see how the same naming can have different meanings. What’s important is that the library establishes its naming convention explicitly and uses it consistently.</p>
<h4 id="a">A<a href="#a">🔗</a></h4>
<p>The suffix <code>A</code> means that the function works with some general <code>Applicative</code> type (the type that has the <code>Applicative</code> instance).</p>
<p>Examples:</p>
<div id="cb15"><pre><code><span id="cb15-1"><span>sequenceA</span><span> ::</span> (<span>Traversable</span> t, <span>Applicative</span> f) <span>=&gt;</span> t (f a) <span>-&gt;</span> f (t a)</span></code></pre></div>
<h4 id="m">M<a href="#m">🔗</a></h4>
<p>The suffix <code>M</code> is among the most common ones. It usually means that the function works with the <code>Monad</code>s or in the monadic context.</p>
<p>Similarly to the previous suffixes, functions <em>with</em> <code>M</code> have their counterparts <em>without</em> <code>M</code>:</p>
<div>
<div>
<div id="cb16"><pre><code><span id="cb16-1"><span>filter</span></span>
<span id="cb16-2"></span>
<span id="cb16-3"><span>    ::</span> (a <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Bool</span>)</span>
<span id="cb16-4">    <span>-&gt;</span> [a]</span>
<span id="cb16-5">    <span>-&gt;</span> [a]</span></code></pre></div>
</div>
<div>
<div id="cb17"><pre><code><span id="cb17-1">filterM</span>
<span id="cb17-2"><span>    ::</span> <span>Applicative</span> m</span>
<span id="cb17-3">    <span>=&gt;</span> (a <span>-&gt;</span> m <span>Bool</span>)</span>
<span id="cb17-4">    <span>-&gt;</span> [a]</span>
<span id="cb17-5">    <span>-&gt;</span> m [a]</span></code></pre></div>
</div>
</div>
<blockquote>
<p>Note: Historically, the standard Haskell library <code>base</code> didn’t have <code>Applicative</code> functors, and there weren’t the superclass of Monads. But now the suffix <code>M</code> is also sometimes used with Applicative functions.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="underscore-_">Underscore _<a href="#underscore-_">🔗</a></h3>
<p>Underscore, as a suffix of functions, also has a special meaning. It gives us a clue that the function works exactly as the one without <code>_</code> but discards the result (returns <code>()</code> instead).</p>
<p>Examples:</p>
<div>
<div>
<div id="cb18"><pre><code><span id="cb18-1">concurrently</span>
<span id="cb18-2"><span>    ::</span> <span>IO</span> a</span>
<span id="cb18-3">    <span>-&gt;</span> <span>IO</span> b</span>
<span id="cb18-4">    <span>-&gt;</span> <span>IO</span> (a, b)</span></code></pre></div>
</div>
<div>
<div id="cb19"><pre><code><span id="cb19-1">concurrently_</span>
<span id="cb19-2"><span>    ::</span> <span>IO</span> a</span>
<span id="cb19-3">    <span>-&gt;</span> <span>IO</span> b</span>
<span id="cb19-4">    <span>-&gt;</span> <span>IO</span> ()</span></code></pre></div>
</div>
</div>
<h3 id="number">Number<a href="#number">🔗</a></h3>
<p>You can often see the series of functions with the numbers at the end of their names. These groups have the same initial part but differ with the number. Numbers there represent the <strong>number of arguments</strong> each function takes.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>🔢 The number 1 is not used usually in that meaning as it’s redundant.</p>
</blockquote>
<div>
<div>
<div id="cb20"><pre><code><span id="cb20-1"><span>liftA  ::</span> <span>Applicative</span> f</span>

</div>
</div>
<p>Number 1 has a special meaning of requiring at least one argument to be present in a container:</p>
<div id="cb26"><pre><code><span id="cb26-1"><span>foldr</span><span>  ::</span> <span>Foldable</span> t <span>=&gt;</span> (a <span>-&gt;</span> b <span>-&gt;</span> b) <span>-&gt;</span> b <span>-&gt;</span> t a <span>-&gt;</span> b</span>
<span id="cb26-2"><span>foldr1</span><span> ::</span> <span>Foldable</span> t <span>=&gt;</span> (a <span>-&gt;</span> a <span>-&gt;</span> a) <span>-&gt;</span> t a <span>-&gt;</span> a</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Though, the fact that it works with <code>Foldable</code> is not ideal. There is <a href="https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/issues/13573">a proposal</a> to implement a typeclass called <code>Foldable</code> (or <code>Semifoldable</code>) for non-empty types.</p>
<h3 id="lr">L/R<a href="#lr">🔗</a></h3>
<p>The suffixes <code>L</code> and <code>R</code> (sometimes <code>l</code> and <code>r</code>) represent the direction of function application or order of traversing a data structure.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>ℹ️ Most of the time, these sibling functions have the same type, but in some functions, certain arguments are reversed for convenience.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Examples:</p>
<div id="cb27"><pre><code><span id="cb27-1"><span>foldr</span><span> ::</span> <span>Foldable</span> t <span>=&gt;</span> (a <span>-&gt;</span> b <span>-&gt;</span> b) <span>-&gt;</span> b <span>-&gt;</span> t a <span>-&gt;</span> b</span>

<span id="cb27-3"></span>
<span id="cb27-4"><span>scanr</span><span> ::</span> (a <span>-&gt;</span> b <span>-&gt;</span> b) <span>-&gt;</span> b <span>-&gt;</span> [a] <span>-&gt;</span> [b]</span>
<span id="cb27-5"><span>scanl</span><span> ::</span> (b <span>-&gt;</span> a <span>-&gt;</span> b) <span>-&gt;</span> b <span>-&gt;</span> [a] <span>-&gt;</span> [b]</span>

<h3 id="byon">By/On<a href="#byon">🔗</a></h3>
<p>Some of the overloaded functions that work with <code>Foldable</code>s or lists have a non-overloaded sibling with the suffix <code>By</code>.</p>
<p>It is often convenient to use these functions together with <code>on</code>, for instance:</p>
<div id="cb28"><pre><code><span id="cb28-1">sortBy (<span>compare</span> <span>`on`</span> <span>fst</span>)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>This <code>on</code> pattern is so widely used, so functions also have the suffix <code>On</code>.</p>
<p>Compare these three types:</p>
<div>
<div>
<div id="cb29"><pre><code><span id="cb29-1"><span>sort</span></span>
<span id="cb29-2"><span>    ::</span> <span>Ord</span> a</span>

</div>
</div>
<h3 id="p">P<a href="#p">🔗</a></h3>
<p>In some libraries or applications’ code, the suffix <code>P</code> shows that the function is a parser of some type, e.g.&nbsp;when using the <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/optparse-applicative">optparse-applicative</a> library. The usage of this naming convention can look like this:</p>
<div id="cb32"><pre><code><span id="cb32-1"><span>data</span> <span>Config</span> <span>=</span> <span>Config</span></span>
<span id="cb32-2">    {<span> configPort ::</span> <span>Port</span></span>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
        <p>The researchers who work with binary data have eyes trained on recognizing patterns in hexdumps.</p>

<p>The pattern consists of bytes with redundancy in them. Such pattern may include array of correlated values, structures with fixed length, runs of bytes, textual data, machine instruction fragments, etc.</p>

<p>The researchers may look for patterns in hexdump of some file or memory content. That covers lots of more specific content types, such as varying file formats, malware samples, firmware images, process memory dumps, etc.</p>

<p>There are many reasons to analyze a hexdump. For each situation the reasons may vary. Here are few:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Improve data compression ratio of the compression algorithm.</li>
	<li>Improve data mutation efficiency of the fuzzer.</li>
	<li>Have an idea of how the program parses and processes the data, without reverse engineering the program (which may not even be available to access).</li>
	<li>Improve decision making for telling if a sample is malware, and if it is malware, which family it can be associated with.</li>
	<li>Recover data artifacts from a corrupted or an unknown sample. Recover concealed data from sample hidden by stenography techniques.</li>
	<li>Hypothesize on the layout of the data.</li>
	<li>Find anomaly in data such as in network traffic.</li>
	<li>Decide on if data is random (when no redundancies are observed).</li>
</ul>

<p>Being able to automate the manual pattern recognition task would have two important advantages:</p>

<ol>
	<li>A tool would allow for anyone to assist in recognizing patterns in a hexdump.</li>
	<li>Analyses could have been done in batches and at scale.</li>
</ol>

<p>The core strategy for automated hexdump analysis is like this.</p>

<p>The automation splits the input stream into blocks. I approximated the number of bytes I can manually process at a time when looking at hexdump and I came up with a number, so the block has a size of 64 bytes, which is just large enough to contain patterns in it.</p>

<p>The pattern recognition is being done through analyzers.</p>

<p>There is a set of analyzers for different patterns. Each analyzer runs on a block. The result of the analyzers are being compared that the analyzer with the best result, that is with the highest score, will describe the block.</p>

<p>When comparing the result between two analyzers, the one that covers for more bytes has the higher score. The higher score means more certainty. If the score is the absolute maximum it means 100% certainty.</p>

<p>The name of the analyzer should be as relevant as possible to every single byte incorporated in the pattern recognition.</p>

<p>Each analyzer is given a distinct priority. If two analyzers come back with the same score for a given block, the analyzer with the higher priority will describe the block.</p>

<p>The reason to maintain a priority list for the analyzers is because one analyzer is more specific than other and more meaningful than other.</p>

                <div>
                    <p><strong>Confusing UI design = Recipe for Disaster</strong> – &nbsp;Setting up 2FA on our PayPal business account was exactly that. Usually most payment providers make 2FA a mandate in the setup process, or, at least asks its users to set it up during sign up itself, but PayPal doesn't. I have no complaints about PayPal's Infosec standards as they have been running a successful bug bounty program on Hackerone and seem to have a very responsive and active security team. </p><h2 id="update">Update</h2><p>We did some more research and found out this problem has been there for more than 2 years now yet no action from PayPal's end – <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/paypal/comments/7teop7/twofactor_auth">https://www.reddit.com/r/paypal/comments/7teop7/twofactor_auth</a></p><p>We haven't received any response from PayPal yet but have gotten in touch with them regarding the same.</p><figure><img src="https://savebreach.com/content/images/2020/11/image-4.png" alt="" srcset="https://savebreach.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/11/image-4.png 600w, https://savebreach.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/11/image-4.png 1000w, https://savebreach.com/content/images/2020/11/image-4.png 1525w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Users complaining about the issue on PayPal</figcaption></figure><h2 id="2fa-and-account-compromise">2FA and Account Compromise</h2><p>Setting up 2FA is really critical for account security, and PayPal accounts are no different – naturally, they are a more interesting target for hackers due to the price tag attached to them. Thus, enabling 2FA in the first place would be the most logical step to prevent unauthorized account intrusions and account hacks, as every log in would require a TOTP code from an authenticator app like Google Authenticator or, Authy as part of the 2FA process. However, I found this process really hard due to the confusing documentation on PayPal website. </p><p>The process to setup 2FA on PayPal for account security was by far the most difficult, time consuming and confusing process ever but when we get to it... you can realize how simple it could have actually been. Its the most important step to take to prevent getting your PayPal account hacked or, breached or, compromised. In this post, I have explained the full process and why it was so confusing.</p><p>PayPal's confusing UI design can become a threat to user account security &nbsp;as it makes it harder for users to setup 2FA for their accounts.</p><p>But it was, really... I mean <strong>REALLY</strong> difficult for me to locate their 2FA option. I couldn't spot it anywhere in their UI even after several Google searches about this, nothing showed up – whatever did was either too outdated or, totally useless or, deprecated. </p><p>Confused, I got in touch with their Customer Support who pointed me to their the <strong>Settings </strong>page, and told a <strong>Security </strong>page was located there. But... what? I couldn't find one. Weird, that's how difficult PayPal makes it to simply add an additional layer of security to your account. This made me wonder, why is it so difficult to enable a simple security feature like 2FA on PayPal? I tried everything, every button and navigation links on their Android and iOS apps too but failed to locate the 2FA setup page.</p><p>Utterly disappointed, when I came across <a href="https://www.paypal.com/in/smarthelp/article/-what-is-2-step-verification-faq4057?app=searchAutoComplete">this</a> Help Center Article which was disguised in the form of a general FAQ about 2FA but, finally I found that <a href="https://www.paypal.com/in/smarthelp/article/-what-is-2-step-verification-faq4057?app=searchAutoComplete">magic link</a>! – </p><figure><a href="https://www.paypal.com/in/smarthelp/article/-what-is-2-step-verification-faq4057?app=searchAutoComplete"><div><p>what-is-2-step-verification</p><p><img src="https://www.paypalobjects.com/webstatic/icon/pp196.png"></p></div></a></figure><p>Well, there's a catch. </p><h2 id="the-catch">The Catch</h2><p>When you are <strong>logged out</strong>, PayPal would show the following 2FA Setup process instructions in their <strong><a href="https://www.paypal.com/in/smarthelp/article/-what-is-2-step-verification-faq4057?app=searchAutoComplete">Documentation/Help Guide</a> – </strong></p><figure><img src="https://savebreach.com/content/images/2020/11/image-1.png" alt="" srcset="https://savebreach.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/11/image-1.png 600w, https://savebreach.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/11/image-1.png 1000w, https://savebreach.com/content/images/size/w1600/2020/11/image-1.png 1600w, https://savebreach.com/content/images/2020/11/image-1.png 1637w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Logged-out 2FA Setup Guide</figcaption></figure><p>However, when you are <strong>logged in, </strong>the instructions asked you to go to profile page and setup 2FA from there – <a href="https://www.paypal.com/businessmanage/profile/loginSecurity">this</a> is the <a href="https://www.paypal.com/businessmanage/profile/loginSecurity">final link</a> that leads to the <a href="https://www.paypal.com/businessmanage/profile/loginSecurity">2FA setup process</a>. This is <strong>how simple it could have been, </strong>but confusing documentation on the help pages and equally misleading instructions given by customer support made the process incredibly hard and confusing!</p><figure><img src="https://savebreach.com/content/images/2020/11/image-2.png" alt="" srcset="https://savebreach.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/11/image-2.png 600w, https://savebreach.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/11/image-2.png 1000w, https://savebreach.com/content/images/size/w1600/2020/11/image-2.png 1600w, https://savebreach.com/content/images/2020/11/image-2.png 1715w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Logged-in Profile Page for 2FA Setup</figcaption></figure><h2 id="steps-to-setup-or-add-2fa-to-your-paypal-account-business-account-users-">Steps to setup or, add 2FA to your PayPal account (Business account users)</h2><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><ul>
<li>Click on <strong>Update</strong> after navigating to <strong>Login and Security</strong> page from PayPal Profile page navigation</li>
<li>After clicking on Update, choose your 2FA option. <strong>Choose Authenticator</strong> which is more secure than mobile phone based 2FA. I prefer <strong>Authy</strong>. PayPal 2FA should work with most TOTP authenticator apps.</li>
<li>Scan the code with your Authenticator app or, manually enter the code</li>
<li>Enter the TOTP code on PayPal website after adding PayPal in the Authenticator app,</li>
<li>You have succesffully added 2FA to your PayPal account. To make it more secure, you can go ahead and add SMS 2FA layer as extra defence too.</li>
</ul>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>Turns out PayPal might have done some UI revamping which effectively resulted in concealing the <strong>Security </strong>page's navigation from Account Settings page. The whole thing was pretty troublesome for me. But now that I was able to setup 2FA back again, I have got back my peace of mind back!</p><h3 id="how-the-paypal-cs-reacted">How the PayPal CS reacted</h3><p>However, for me it was even more disappointing was when even their customer support staff too failed to guide me in this regard – </p><figure><img src="https://savebreach.com/content/images/2020/11/image-3.png" alt="" srcset="https://savebreach.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/11/image-3.png 600w, https://savebreach.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/11/image-3.png 1000w, https://savebreach.com/content/images/size/w1600/2020/11/image-3.png 1600w, https://savebreach.com/content/images/2020/11/image-3.png 1737w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>PayPal Customer Support's response</figcaption></figure><h2 id="no-2fa-setup-available-in-paypal-mobile-apps">No 2FA Setup available in PayPal Mobile Apps</h2><p>When I last checked, there was no 2FA setup option in the mobile app UI which is an eye sore. Every major payment provider allows merchants and business users to setup 2FA right from the mobile – but I couldn't find the option in either of the apps – neither Android nor iOS which is bad from a security and accessibility standpoint.</p><h2 id="my-opinion">My Opinion</h2><p>PayPal itself isn't insecure but these are what I call – classic business logic errors. The UI is the first step towards making a better application and give an overall good experience to the average consumer. Secondly, I had to face a not-so knowledgeable customer support staff who explained how to <strong>navigate to 2FA setup, </strong>but turns out that's not the actual way. I have spent probably tens of thousands of dollars <em>over</em>paying PayPal fees and this is what I get in terms of value for money or, my ROI, a bad user experience (UX). I'm not blaming anyone – but despite charging so much in fees, PayPal still hasn't been able to provide a proper UI/UX to its clients. There are several pain points in their UI, and nothing much has changed in most critical parts of their web app since the past 10-12 years, only some parts of the UI/UX has been revamped but some <strong>areas </strong>like 2FA setup are harder because of PayPal's extremely clunky and confusing UI.</p><p>If app developers don't design the UI properly, they can unintentionally cause losses on the part of their users – as in this case, a legitimate user couldn't setup 2FA on their account due to a buggy UI. I strongly feel UI and UX form a core part of an Application's security and not just the backend and frontend parts involving code. <strong>The UI features should encourage the user to enable more security features in the app, </strong>but in this case – it was misleading and confusing.</p><h2 id="harder-ui-more-security-issues-effectively">Harder UI = More Security Issues, effectively</h2><p>With harder UI in fine grained applications with varying levels of access controls, it becomes increasingly harder for users to manage account restrictions and security policies. As in this example, the <strong>Security </strong>page was hidden from the view which potentially makes a user account more susceptible to compromise. A better and smooth UI ensures a user is able to setup every security setting to optimal level. </p><p>Harder the UI = More the confusion on the part of the user. This can leave organization accounts open to breaches and evidently a lot of hackers are exploiting misconfigurations in application due to user ignorance.</p><h2 id="closing-thoughts">Closing Thoughts</h2><p>The entire process was far more painstaking and confusing, than how simple it should have been on the contrary. Thus, making a more intuitive and proper UI is very important from user security point of view than a confusing feature-loaded loosely designed product. Also, security features like 2FA should be mandated in applications dealing with payments and high value transactions in general. Due to a UI revamp or, refactor, that missed putting into place the Security link in Navigation, users can miss the 2FA setup and for those using weak credentials can end up getting hand – which is how hundreds of thousands of PayPal accounts and Credit Card &nbsp;data aka <strong>Fullz </strong>end up getting hacked and sold on darknet marketplaces.</p><blockquote><em><strong>How we can help?</strong></em></blockquote><blockquote><em><strong><a href="https://savebreach.com/">SaveBreach</a></strong> conducts in-depth security research, bug hunting, and security consultancy.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2 id="article-series">Article series</h2><ul><li>1st part :: <a href="https://dev.l1x.be/posts/2020/11/22/getting-started-with-firecracker-on-raspberry-pi/">https://dev.l1x.be/posts/2020/11/22/getting-started-with-firecracker-on-raspberry-pi/</a></li><li>2nd part :: this</li></ul><h2 id="intro">Intro</h2><p>Last time in the 1st article I briefly introduced Firecracker as a lightweight virtualization/containerization solution for extreme-scale (like AWS Lambda functions). This time around I am going to dig a bit deeper into the API and the management of microVMs. I am going to install Alpine on RPI, install Rust and Python, Docker, get the Linux kernel source and compile a new kernel with minimal config, compile our own Firecracker and then create a new rootfs to be able to boot up a guest. Most of these steps are optional, you can use the stock kernel the Firecracker team provides or download Firecracker release from Github.</p><h2 id="setup-alpine">Setup Alpine</h2><p>If you do not care about Alpine on RPI you can jump to the Firecracker section.</p><p>I would like to keep going with <a href="https://amzn.to/2Klb9fx">Raspberry Pi 4B 8GB</a> or <a href="https://amzn.to/2KeohTO">Raspberry Pi 4B 4GB</a> for many reasons. It is a small system that you can easily hack on without any change on your desktop. It is also an ARM64 (ARM Cortex-A72) system that has great performance even without active cooling. I usually use it with a <a href="https://amzn.to/3naOS2L">alu case</a> that provides the best heat dispersion and a cool CPU. It has enough CPU power and memory to compile any software including Firecracker, the Linux kernel, and more. Since this project is a side project I don’t care how long it takes to finish a new kernel, usually finishes within 2 hours (I might get exact timing later).</p><p>Another item on my to-do list is to get Alpine Linux as both the host and the guest system. For those who do not know Alpine is a small Linux distribution designed for security, simplicity, and resource efficiency. It comes with sane defaults and Musl as its C standard library. Alpine uses its own package management system, apk-tools, providing super-fast package installation. Alpine allows a very small system with minimal installation being around 130 MB. The init system is the lightweight OpenRC, Alpine does not use systemd. This was the primary reason I wanted to get into Alpine.</p><h3 id="installing-alpine-on-rpi-4">Installing Alpine on RPI 4</h3><p>This is the most complicated part of the setup because RPI has a special boot procedure that uses a FAT partition and the GPU. When installing Alpine first you need to create a FAT partition at the beginning of the SD card with MBR. I am using MacOS this time. I am pretty sure it is easy to translate this to Linux (not sure about Windows.)</p><h4 id="creating-the-partition">Creating the partition</h4><p>My microSD card is /dev/disk6. I create a partition with the name ALP (1024MB), then activate it with fdisk.</p><div><pre><code data-lang="bash">diskutil list
diskutil partitionDisk /dev/disk6 MBR <span>"FAT32"</span> ALP 1024MB <span>"Free Space"</span> SYS R
sudo fdisk -e /dev/disk6
&gt; f <span>1</span>
&gt; w
&gt; <span>exit</span>
</code></pre></div><p>After this command runs successfully MacOS mounts the newly created partition in /Volumes/ALP.</p><h4 id="downloading-alpine-and-writing-it-to-the-sd-card">Downloading Alpine and writing it to the SD card</h4><p>You can initiate the download anywhere, make sure the previously created partition is mounted.</p><div><pre><code data-lang="bash">wget http://dl-cdn.alpinelinux.org/alpine/v3.12/releases/aarch64/alpine-rpi-3.12.1-aarch64.tar.gz
tar xzvf alpine-rpi-3.12.1-aarch64.tar.gz -C /Volumes/ALP/
</code></pre></div><h4 id="configuring-rpi-boot">Configuring RPI boot</h4><p>This part is optional, you can disable audio, wifi, Bluetooth, etc and enable UART, configure GPU mem. The full documentation is here:</p><p><a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/configuration/config-txt/">https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/configuration/config-txt/</a></p><div><pre><code data-lang="bash"><span>cd</span> /Volumes/ALP/
<span>echo</span> <span>'dtparam=audio=off'</span>          &gt;&gt; usercfg.txt
<span>echo</span> <span>'dtoverlay=pi3-disable-wifi'</span> &gt;&gt; usercfg.txt
<span>echo</span> <span>'enable_uart=1'</span>              &gt;&gt; usercfg.txt
<span>echo</span> <span>'gpu_mem=64'</span>                 &gt;&gt; usercfg.txt
<span>echo</span> <span>'disable_overscan=1'</span>         &gt;&gt; usercfg.txt
</code></pre></div><p>You are ready to remove the SD card.</p><div><pre><code data-lang="bash"><span>cd</span>
diskutil eject /dev/disk6
</code></pre></div><h4 id="booting-and-configuring-alpine">Booting and configuring Alpine</h4><p>After inserting the SD card into the RPI you can boot it up. I am using a special converter that converts the mini HDMI to a normal HDMI <a href="https://amzn.to/3452Ziz">converter</a> that makes it easy to connect a TV or a monitor to the PI. I usually connect the device to the network with an ethernet cable and plug in a wired USB keyboard.</p><p>Once the device is booting up you can login with root (no password).</p><p>Alpine has a neat tool to configure a new system. It asks a few questions about keyboard layout and timezone, also makes you create a root password.</p><p>Once setup-alpine is done you need to change a few things around because up to this moment you operated on the FAT partition. After updating the system and adding cfdisk you can create a new partition and use the remaining space on the SD card to have a proper system. In cfdisk, select “Free space” and the option “New”. It suggests using the entire available space, just press enter, then select the option “primary”, followed by “Write”. Type “yes” to write the partition table to disk, then select “Quit”.</p><div><pre><code data-lang="bash">apk update
apk upgrade
apk add cfdisk e2fsprogs
cfdisk /dev/mmcblk0
</code></pre></div><p>Once our new partition is ready you need to create a filesystem on it and install a basic Alpine system with setup-disk. In “sys” mode, it’s an installer, it permanently installs Alpine on the disk. Ignore the errors, there might be some while executing setup-disk.</p><div><pre><code data-lang="bash">mkfs.ext4 /dev/mmcblk0p2
mount /dev/mmcblk0p2 /mnt
setup-disk -m sys /mnt
mount -o remount,rw /media/mmcblk0p1
</code></pre></div><p>This section is what I found on the Alpine wiki and it works. There might be an easier way.</p><div><pre><code data-lang="bash">rm -f /media/mmcblk0p1/boot/*
<span>cd</span> /mnt
rm boot/boot
mv boot/* /media/mmcblk0p1/boot/
rm -Rf boot
mkdir media/mmcblk0p1
ln -s media/mmcblk0p1/boot boot
</code></pre></div><p>There are only two steps left, adjusting fstab and cmdline.txt.</p><p>Fstab:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="bash"><span>UUID</span><span>=</span>your-uui-id  /                 ext4  rw,relatime  <span>0</span> <span>0</span>
/dev/mmcblk0p1    /media/mmcblk0p1  vfat  rw           <span>0</span> <span>0</span>
</code></pre></div><p>Add the following content to etc/fstab (please note no starting /).</p><p>Appending the following to the cmdline.txt:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="bash">vi /media/mmcblk0p1/cmdline.txt
</code></pre></div><p>It looks like this for me:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="bash">cat /media/mmcblk0p1/cmdline.txt
<span>modules</span><span>=</span>loop,squashfs,sd-mod,usb-storage quiet <span>console</span><span>=</span>tty1 <span>root</span><span>=</span>/dev/mmcblk0p2
</code></pre></div><p>I am not sure if lbu commit is necessary here. When Alpine Linux boots in diskless mode, initially it only loads a few required packages from the boot device by default. But local adjustments in RAM are possible, e.g. by installing a package or adjusting some configuration.</p><p>You can reboot and log in with root and verify everything is working. Going forward it is best to have a user other than root.</p><div><pre><code data-lang="bash">adduser l1x
addgroup l1x wheel
</code></pre></div><p>I usually add the following packages and start to use sudo going forward:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="bash">sudo apk add tmux fish ninja clang g++ sudo git python3 socat curl vim procps
</code></pre></div><p>Make sure that wheel group can use sudo:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="bash">%wheel <span>ALL</span><span>=(</span>ALL<span>)</span> NOPASSWD: ALL
</code></pre></div><p>Changing my shell to fish:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="bash">l1x:x:1000:1000:Linux User,,,:/home/l1x:/usr/bin/fish
</code></pre></div><p>Hopefully, by now you have a working environment. I use a bigger drive for /data where I store all the development folders.</p><div><pre><code data-lang="bash">l1x@alpine ~&gt; mount <span>|</span> column -t <span>|</span> egrep <span>'^/dev'</span>
/dev/mmcblk0p2  on  /                 <span>type</span>  ext4        <span>(</span>rw,relatime<span>)</span>
/dev/mmcblk0p1  on  /media/mmcblk0p1  <span>type</span>  vfat        <span>(</span>rw,relatime,fmask<span>=</span>0022,dmask<span>=</span>0022,codepage<span>=</span>437,...<span>)</span>
/dev/sda1       on  /data             <span>type</span>  xfs         <span>(</span>rw,relatime,attr2,inode64,logbufs<span>=</span>8,logbsize<span>=</span>32k,...<span>)</span>
</code></pre></div><h2 id="setting-up-firecracker-dev-environment">Setting up Firecracker dev environment</h2><p>Once you logged in via SSH to your Alpine system make sure you have the dev tools you are going to need. I usually use the following tools, and some more:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="bash">sudo apk add tmux git python3 curl vim
</code></pre></div><p>I was trying to figure out how to install Rust on ARM64 linux and the most straightforward way looks like:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="bash">curl --proto <span>'=https'</span> --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs <span>|</span> sh
</code></pre></div><p>If you want to compile Firecracker yourself you also need Docker. Docker for this version of Alpine lives in the community repo. Simply append the community line to your repositories:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="bash">cat /etc/apk/repositories
<span>#/media/mmcblk0p1/apks</span>
http://your.nearest.mirror/mirrors/pub/alpine/v3.12/main
http://your.nearest.mirror/mirrors/pub/alpine/v3.12/community
</code></pre></div><p>Installing Docker:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="bash">sudo apk add docker
sudo addgroup <span>$USER</span> docker
sudo rc-update add docker boot
sudo service docker start
</code></pre></div><p>After Docker is running you can clone the Firecracker repo:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="bash">git clone git@github.com:firecracker-microvm/firecracker.git
</code></pre></div><p>Before you can compile a release you need to install two more packages:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="bash">sudo apk add bash ncurses
</code></pre></div><p>Now you can compile the Firecracker binaries:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="bash">./tools/devtool build --release --libc musl

</code></pre></div><p>Using these binaries we can create the VMs.</p><h2 id="creating-a-microvm">Creating a microVM</h2><p>Before getting started, there are multiple ways to start a microVM with Firecracker.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
			<p>This is an issue of my newsletter focusing on the psychological and technical aspects of the Internet, particularly remote work, online economy, and cognitive load. <a href="#signup">Sign up below to join the club</a></p>
<p>This issue of Deliberate Internet is one of those deep dives fueled by curiosity. This time it’s about science journals, Sci-Hub, Open Access, and the ugly underworld of academic publishing.</p>



<p>I don’t recall much from my psychology studies. I have some vague notion of what I learned over the 5 years, but one of the strongest memories was a feeling of utter frustration over accessing the research papers needed to write my thesis. I would find a perfect avenue of research only to be stopped by a science journal paywall.</p>



<p>My research on a quirk of human memory called “<em>source monitoring error”</em> probably would not advance the COVID vaccine, HIV cure, or the hunt for clean energy sources. But others working on those problems may be missing a key breakthrough because their university may have not purchased access to <strong>that</strong> particular journal.</p>



<p>The dizzying progress of humanity over the last 500 years is all thanks to the scientific method:</p>



<ol><li>Come up with a hypothesis about the world</li><li>Test it rigorously, trying to disprove it</li><li>If it still stands, invite others to disprove it</li><li>If they cannot disprove it – it’s accepted as fact</li><li>Upon this foundation, new, more complex hypotheses can move the understanding of the world forward.</li></ol>



<p>These few principles ushered a new age dubbed the Scientific Revolution. Humanity was able to advance technology to the point beyond any imagination. As Yuval Noah Harari writes in <a href="https://piszek.com/2019/08/09/homo-deus/">Homo Deus</a>:</p>



<blockquote><p><em>During the Scientific Revolution humankind silenced the gods too. The world was now a one-man show.</em></p></blockquote>



<p>Despite what your uncle may believe, the canonical unit of disseminating science is <strong>not</strong> Youtube.</p>



<p>The <strong>research paper</strong> is the “deliverable” of scientists’ work. But it’s nothing without a <strong>research journal</strong> to publish it in. <em>Science</em> and <em>Nature</em> are the most prestigious ones.</p>



<p>Amongst scientists, there is the mantra “publish or perish” – they need to earn points (quite literary) by publishing papers in journals. The system is designed in theory to incentivize sharing results, discussing them, and subjecting them to peer review.</p>



<p>It’s a system where everything comes under scrutiny – <strong>except the journals themselves</strong>. Science itself became a feudal system where scientists have to fight to get published AND pay the journals to access their peer’s research papers. As the aforementioned Science quotes in “<a href="https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2016/04/whos-downloading-pirated-papers-everyone">Who’s downloading pirated research papers – everyone</a>“:</p>



<blockquote><p><em>“Publishers give nothing to the authors, so why should they receive anything more than a small amount for managing the journal?”</em></p></blockquote>



<p>The article opens with the story of Amirkabir from Iran. His experience closely mirrors my own:</p>



<blockquote><p><em>To read a 2011 paper in Applied Mathematics and Computation, Rahimi would have to pay the publisher, Elsevier, $28. A 2015 paper in Operations Research, published by the U.S.-based company INFORMS, would cost $30. (…) Purchasing the papers was going to cost $1000 this week alone—about as much as his monthly living expenses</em></p></blockquote>



<p>A group of science journal publishers – with Elsevier as the biggest one – has monopolized the science publishing industry, with universities as their captive customers. They need to buy access for their staff and students so that they can do their research – and of course – publish the work themselves. From the same Science <a href="https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2016/04/whos-downloading-pirated-papers-everyone">article</a>:</p>



<blockquote><p>(A statement) (…) <em>university recently issued about the impact of journal subscription rate hikes on its library budget:</em></p><p><em> “Scholarly resources are not luxury goods,” it says. “But they are priced as though they were.”</em></p></blockquote>



<h3>Why don’t scientists just release their papers in other journals?</h3>



<p>Scientist incentivized to publish research papers present demand. It’s no wonder that the supply side has popped up – and is serving stuff that is not up to snuff:</p>

<p>A whole crop of “predatory journals” is publishing <span>any</span> paper – for a fee.</p>



<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predatory_publishing">Predatory publishing</a> has been a real problem. In 2013 John Bohannon submitted a paper called “<em>Who’s Afraid of Peer Review?</em>” with purposefully deeply flawed methodology and got published in 60% of journals he submitted it to – including those backed by Elsevier and Wolters Kluver.</p>



<p>If you need a stronger proof that something is not right – a team of researchers annoyed at an email just like the one I received <a href="https://www.vox.com/2014/11/21/7259207/scientific-paper-scam">submitted a paper called “Get me off your fucking email list”, and got published</a>:</p>



<figure><img data-attachment-id="1196" data-permalink="https://deliber.at/2020/science-publishing/zrzut-ekranu-2020-12-12-o-20-49-45/" data-orig-file="https://i1.wp.com/deliber.at/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/12/Zrzut-ekranu-2020-12-12-o-20.49.45.png?fit=768%2C403&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="768,403" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="Zrzut-ekranu-2020-12-12-o-20.49.45" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i1.wp.com/deliber.at/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/12/Zrzut-ekranu-2020-12-12-o-20.49.45.png?fit=600%2C315&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i1.wp.com/deliber.at/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/12/Zrzut-ekranu-2020-12-12-o-20.49.45.png?fit=768%2C403&amp;ssl=1" src="https://i1.wp.com/deliber.at/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/12/Zrzut-ekranu-2020-12-12-o-20.49.45.png?resize=600%2C315&amp;ssl=1" alt="" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/deliber.at/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/12/Zrzut-ekranu-2020-12-12-o-20.49.45.png?resize=600%2C315&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i1.wp.com/deliber.at/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/12/Zrzut-ekranu-2020-12-12-o-20.49.45.png?w=768&amp;ssl=1 768w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption>Possibly one of the best research papers ever published.</figcaption></figure>



<p>These journals want to “prop themselves up” with established names and are eager to get scientists on their “editorial team” to serve as figureheads. A Polish team of researchers has submitted a blatantly fake resume of “Anna O. Szust” (from Polish: Anna F.raudster ) and of course – in many cases, they (or Anna) were invited to lend the name (<a href="https://time.com/4706774/science-journals-fraud-study/">Time magazine</a>).</p>



<p>In this cesspool of fraud, spam, and lies, scientists are desperate to get their names into at least a half-decent journal, so they buckle up and pay.</p>



<h3>Enter Sci Hub</h3>



<p>Frustrated like everyone else (except Elsevier execs), but much more resourceful and determined – Alexandra Elbakyan created <a href="https://sci-hub.se/">Sci-Hub </a>in 2011. The site is online “exchange” for Science Papers.</p>



<p><strong>Here is how it works:</strong></p>



<ol><li>Scientists with legitimate access to articles (and frustrated by the current situation) are lending their credentials needed to download research papers</li><li>You search a paper by the URL or identifier number</li><li>If it’s in the database, you can download it</li><li>If it’s not – it will be downloaded using credentials from point 1.</li></ol>



<p>Saying that Sci-Hub is big is an understatement. It’s now THE science article database. And no wonder – from the same Science article:</p>



<blockquote><p><em>The numbers are just staggering,” one senior executive at a major publisher told me upon learning the Sci-Hub statistics. “It suggests an almost complete failure to provide a path of access for these researchers.” He works for a company that publishes some of the most heavily downloaded content on Sci-Hub and requested anonymity so he could speak candidly.</em></p></blockquote>



<p>Researchers can now find all the papers they need in one place, without tracking down for weeks that elusive obscure paper that they really need. God, I wish I had something like this during my studies.</p>



<h3>Wait, isn’t that illegal?</h3>



<p>Yes, it very well may be. But I also think it’s ethical.</p>



<p>I am a fan of subscriptions, I<a href="https://wordpress.com/blog/2019/11/12/recurring-payments/"> build subscription tools for a living</a>, and <a href="https://piszek.com/2020/05/18/paywalls/">have written about them</a>, but my excitement is predicated on the fact that they let the <span>creator</span> pursue bigger risks to make more art (or science).</p>



<p>Paying the science journals helps noone (except, again, Elsevier execs). Consider following facts:</p>



<ul><li><strong>WE</strong> are paying for the research and the work of the scientists (in the form of grants). They receive no compensation from the journal,</li><li>Journals provide no additional value. They are being paid because they have been paid in the past</li><li>Paper authors are ecstatic that their papers get downloaded more. It’s not only more fame and citations (the academia currency), but more peer review as well. They are in this game for science after all.</li></ul>



<p>The cost of the current situation is not the $9.8 Billion that Elsevier is able to rake in yearly. It’s trillions in opportunity cost due to scientists not being able to pay and access the paper that they needed for their next breakthrough.</p>



<h3>Open Access.</h3>



<p>Scientists themselves recognize that something has to give and see the same obvious solutions that we do. From the <a href="https://openaccess.mpg.de/Berlin-Declaration">Berlin Declaration of Open Access:</a></p>



<blockquote><p><em>The Internet has fundamentally changed the practical and economic realities of distributing scientific knowledge and cultural heritage. For the first time ever, the Internet now offers the chance to constitute a global and interactive representation of human knowledge, including cultural heritage and the guarantee of worldwide access.</em></p></blockquote>



<p>Berlin Declaration of Open Access has been published in 2003. The progress of adoption hasn’t been that rapid, so we need Sci-Hub in the meantime.</p>



<p>But despite technological progress, Science itself has been known to move slower at times. The above link to the Open Access declaration is published on Max Planck Society, and it was Max Planck who said that “<em>Science progresses one funeral at a time</em>“.</p>

December 14, 2020 | https://scattered-thoughts.net/writing/looking-for-debugger-2/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://scattered-thoughts.net/writing/looking-for-debugger-2/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
  <p>Continuing my search for a better debugging experience for my current projects (zig/c, nixos). </p>
<p>The <a href="https://scattered-thoughts.net/writing/looking-for-debugger/">first post</a> resulted in a ton of suggestions and I tried them all.</p>
<h2 id="gdb-tui-again">gdb -tui (again)</h2>
<p><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25407161">taviso explained</a> how to use the tui properly. </p>
<p>C-l fixes the display and using <code>gdb -tty $SOME_OTHER_TTY</code> stops it from getting messed up in the first place.</p>
<p>Readline bindings (C-n, C-p etc) work in the command window even while the source window has focus. <code>focus cmd</code> gives focus to the command window so I can use arrow keys again.</p>
<p>C-x A is supposed to toggle the tui but for me just crashes, in both alacritty and xterm. I've <a href="https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/issues/106868">reported this against nix</a> for now, since that's the most likely culprit. (EDIT nope, <a href="https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/pull/106981">it was a gdb bug</a>).</p>
<h2 id="emacs-gdb">emacs gdb</h2>
<p>Many people suggested using <code>gdb</code> and <code>gdb-many-windows</code> instead of <code>gud</code>. </p>
<p>This is much better - I get a clickable thread list, backtrace and locals list.</p>
<p><img src="https://scattered-thoughts.net/writing/looking-for-debugger-2/emacs.png" alt=""></p>
<p>It displays all my locals as "&lt;complex data type&gt;" which is not super helpful. There is a <a href="https://debbugs.gnu.org/cgi/bugreport.cgi?bug=34589">patch</a> to improve this but it looks like it got delayed by legal issues.</p>
<h2 id="emacs-dap-mode">emacs dap-mode</h2>
<p>For gdb this <a href="https://emacs-lsp.github.io/dap-mode/page/configuration/#native-debug-gdblldb">requires</a> the vscode extension which I couldn't get working in the last post, so I haven't investigated further.</p>
<h2 id="clion-again">clion (again)</h2>
<p>Kaylee Blake emailed me:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Several of the issues you encountered with CLion are ones I have previously encountered, and thankfully two of them are solvable and one can be worked around. </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Your variables are (probably) not being displayed because CLion leans on its language support for computing precise start-of-scope for variables (GDB doesn't support this DWARF feature, sadly), but unfortunately defaults to assuming that variables are always out of scope if its language support isn't capable of mapping debug symbols to declarations. (It appears that the Zig plugin doesn't have any debugger integration). As such, you need to click on the gear icon on the left of the debug pane (in your screenshot, hidden behind a <code>&gt;&gt;</code> symbol at the bottom), and uncheck "Hide out-of-scope variables".</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>To use the Memory View, you need to right-click on any variable and choose "Show in Memory View", which will actually cause the pane to load. I have no idea why this is required given that the Memory View is perfectly capable of navigating to raw addresses or addresses computed by arbitrary expressions once the pane has loaded.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>You (probably) can't set breakpoints through the UI because the Zig plugin doesn't register the Zig filetype as capable of having breakpoints set on it. There's no way to fix this without writing a plugin, unfortunately, but you can still use the GDB console to set breakpoints. They won't persist between sessions, though, or show up in the UI.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Both of the fixes worked. I can now see variables and open them in the memory view.</p>
<p><img src="https://scattered-thoughts.net/writing/looking-for-debugger-2/clion.png" alt=""></p>
<p>The memory view doesn't support editing memory, but I can still do that in the gdb console.</p>
<p>I added <code>*actual.items.ptr@100</code> to the watches list and it rendered the whole array perfectly happily.</p>
<p>Setting breakpoints in the gdb console seemed to work at first, but restarting the program to get to the breakpoint doesn't. If I rerun using the button in the debugger, the breakpoints disappear. If I try to restart the program from within gdb, it crashes:</p>
<pre><code><span>(gdb) info breakpoints
No breakpoints or watchpoints.
(gdb) b Tree.searchForwards
Breakpoint 1 at 0x207222: file /home/jamie/focus/lib/focus/tree.zig, line 591.
(gdb) run
Command 'run' is not supported.
(gdb) start
The program being debugged has been started already.
Start it from the beginning? (y or n) [answered Y; input not from terminal]
Temporary breakpoint 2 at 0x2097dc: file /nix/store/5g4w66g606d46w8pmzwzq7flrlk3k7cs-zig/lib/zig/std/start.zig, line 243.
Starting program: /home/jamie/focus/test 1&gt; '/dev/pts/4' 2&gt; '/dev/pts/5' 
During startup program exited with code 1.
</span></code></pre>
<p>I can get this to work by starting the program, immediately pausing, setting a breakpoint and then resuming. </p>
<p>Holding F8 to continue runs smoothly, like most of the other debuggers. But unlike most of the other debuggers the local variables stop being displayed until I release the key, so I can't just watch the changes in real time.</p>
<h2 id="netbeans">netbeans</h2>
<p>I made a new C++ project with the wizard and hit "Debug Main Project". At first I though nothing happened, but after a while I noticed a small red message box at the bottom-right of the screen.</p>
<p><img src="https://scattered-thoughts.net/writing/looking-for-debugger-2/netbeans_0.png" alt=""></p>
<p>It's actually bigger when it first appears, but it shrinks after a few seconds of not being noticed.</p>
<p>Anyway:</p>
<p><img src="https://scattered-thoughts.net/writing/looking-for-debugger-2/netbeans_1.png" alt=""></p>
<p>It says it can't write to /tmp.</p>
<pre><code><span>jamie@machine:~/nixpkgs$ cat &gt; /tmp/test
foo
jamie@machine:~/nixpkgs$ cat /tmp/test
foo
</span></code></pre>
<p>I can write to /tmp.</p>
<p>It also says I should do something like <code>netbeans -J-Dcnd.tmpbase="/home/jamie/netbeans-project"</code>. But that produces the same error message, still referring to "/tmp" rather than the directory I gave it. Did I spell something wrong?</p>
<p>Also:</p>
<pre><code><span>[nix-shell:~]$ strace netbeans 2&gt;&amp;1 | grep 'tmp'

[nix-shell:~]$
</span></code></pre>
<p>It doesn't actually seem to be trying to write "/tmp". It actually doesn't issue any syscalls at all when I press "Debug Main Project" and trigger the message. So I think it's just misreporting some other error. The underlying issue is probably nix-related again.</p>
<p>Also... I try to avoid ranting about software, because software is hard. But if you give me an error message and then make the error text non-selectable and then in the context menu only offer "Mark As Read" instead of "Copy To Clipboard So I Can Google This" then it makes debugging a lot slower.</p>
<h2 id="cgdb">cgdb</h2>
<p>Broadly similar to gdb -tui. It shows the source window and has a lot of useful keyboard shortcuts, but it doesn't display much ambient information like current backtrace or local variables. Everything seems to work, but it's not what I'm looking for.</p>
<h2 id="kdevelop">kdevelop</h2>
<pre><code><span>[nix-shell:~]$ kdevelop --version
kdevelop 5.5.2
</span></code></pre>
<p>Running, breaking, setting watchpoints and navigating the backtrace all worked smoothly.</p>
<p>There doesn't seem to be a memory view or a way to display arbitrary expressions. I tried adding <code>display (*actual.items.ptr)@100</code> in the gdb console and it didn't appear anywhere on screen, nor did it print the result in the console after the first time.</p>
<p>The rendering of large arrays is a bit annoying - you have to click at the beginning to reveal a few more elements, but they appear at the end. So getting the whole thing on screen requires lots of scrolling.</p>
<p>The key binding for 'next' is also in use by kate, so you have to go into the bindings menu and disambiguate. Which wouldn't be a big deal except that it reset several times over the course of a single session so I had to keep visiting the bindings menu.</p>
<h2 id="gdb-dashboard">gdb-dashboard</h2>
<p>An init file for gdb that adds a dashboard, which is printed whenever the program stops and can be hooked to print at other times too.</p>
<p><img src="https://scattered-thoughts.net/writing/looking-for-debugger-2/gdb-dashboard.png" alt=""></p>
<p>This is pretty great. It doesn't offer the easy point-and-click of a gui but it does reliably put a bunch of useful context on the screen. And it manages to do that without breaking or hiding basic features of gdb like most of the gui frontends I tried. </p>
<p>I'm still on the lookout for a good gui debugger, but this is what I'll use in the meantime.</p>
<h2 id="voltron">voltron</h2>
<p>Loris Cro suggested voltron which is similar to gdb-dashboard but opens the various view in separate terminals and updates them in real time. This seems like a strict improvement and I really like the idea.</p>
<p>After wading through the usual python dependency management morass, I managed to occasionally run some voltron views but mostly managed to crash it repeatedly, and occasionally gdb too. </p>
<p>(The gdb crashes are in <a href="https://paste.sr.ht/%7Ejamii/ad867039557cc4c6f5ffe22e4f14a0f13fa78c86">somewhere inside printf</a> so this might be the same issue as the tui crash above.) </p>
<h2 id="gdb-frontend">gdb-frontend</h2>
<p>Ilmari Lauhakangas suggested the somewhat generically named gdb-frontend. </p>
<p>If I type the full path in the file picker it pops up "An error has occurred". You have to type the dirname and then pick the file from the list.</p>
<p>When I ran the program it reached the breakpoint and then the UI stopped responding to button clicks and occasionally spat out messages saying the gdb main thread was blocking.</p>
<p>After C-c in terminal it left behind a bunch of ophan gdb processes that prevented gdbfrontend from being restarted.</p>
<h3 id="ddd-again">ddd (again)</h3>
<p><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25410215">drosan explained</a> that in ddd the focus follows the mouse which explains why I had trouble typing in the text boxes.</p>
<p>The other bugs I experienced are still blockers though.</p>

<p>Other tools that came up in the conversation:</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/hugsy/gef">gef</a> and <a href="https://github.com/pwndbg/pwndbg">pwndbg</a> add a bunch of commands to gdb that are useful for low-level debugging and reverse engineering. 
<a href="https://github.com/radareorg/radare2">radare2</a> is an independent set of tools for the same purpose that can optionally connect to gdb. I don't have much use for these at the moment, but it's good to know about them.</p>
<p><a href="https://codeclap.itch.io/codeclap">codeclap</a> looks interesting but is still in alpha and doesn't have a demo.</p>
<p><a href="https://pernos.co/">pernosco</a> is a project I've been keeping an eye on. It's not currently affordable for hobby stuff, but I can certainly imagine paying for it when I start doing commercial work again.</p>
<p><a href="https://frida.re/">frida</a> injects javascript code into binaries. At the very least, this enables post-hoc println debugging. I've put aside a weekend in my calendar to try it out.</p>
<p><a href="https://justine.storage.googleapis.com/blinkenlights/index.html">blinkenlights</a> I think is a way to watch your code execute as directly as possible, so you can build intuition for what is actually happening on the hardware. I tried it out quickly and it rendered a single frame before exiting with code 0. But it's interesting enough that I made a note to come back and try it again next year.</p>
<p>I haven't tried many proprietary options so far. While I have a strong preference for foss tools, I'm open to suggestions for good proprietary tools so long as I can try them out without emailing a sales team for a quote.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="data-content" v-pre=""> <figure><p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/RwOFZdu.jpg" loading="lazy" alt="How To Install LEMP stack (Linux, Nginx, MySQL, PHP) on Ubuntu System"></p></figure><p>The term LEMP is an acronym of the four open-source projects:</p><ol><li><p><b>L</b>&nbsp;- Linux operating system</p></li><li><p><b>E</b> - Nginx [engine x]<br></p></li><li><p><b>M</b> - MySQL or MariaDB&nbsp;<br></p></li><li><p><b>P</b> - PHP&nbsp;programming language<br></p></li></ol><p>In this post, you will learn how to install Nginx, create Nginx server blocks (virtual host), install and secure MySQL, and install PHP.</p><h2><p>Prerequisites</p></h2><p>The first thing you should make sure you have a regular, non-root user account on your server with <a href="https://qirolab.com/posts/how-to-create-a-sudo-user-on-ubuntu-and-other-debian-based-linux-distributions" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener noreferrer">sudo privileges</a>.&nbsp;</p><h2><p>Step 1. Installing Nginx</p></h2><p>Nginx is available in Ubuntu repositories. So, update the packages index and install Nginx by using the following commands on the terminal:</p><div><pre><code>sudo apt update
sudo apt install nginx</code></pre></div><h2><p>Step 2. Installing MySQL</p></h2><p>Now the web server is ready. The next step is to install MySQL  (a database management system).&nbsp;Install MySQL by using following command:</p><div><pre><code>sudo apt install mysql-server</code></pre></div><p>When the installation is finished, run the <code>mysql_secure_installation</code> command to improve the security of the MySQL installation:</p><div><pre><code>sudo mysql_secure_installation</code></pre></div><p>It will ask to set the root secret password, delete the anonymous user, and remove the test database. You should answer "Y" (yes) to all questions.</p><h2><p>Step 3. Installing PHP</p></h2><p>Since Nginx doesn't contain native PHP handling like some other web servers, you will need to install <code>php-fpm</code>, which stands "fastCGI process manager”. We will tell Nginx to pass PHP requests to this software for processing.</p><p>Install the&nbsp;<code><code>php-fpm</code></code>&nbsp;module along with an additional helper package using following commands:</p><div><pre><code>sudo apt install php-fpm php-opcache php-cli php-gd php-curl php-mysql</code></pre></div><h2><p>Step 4: Configuring Nginx to Use the PHP Processor (create&nbsp;virtual hosts)</p></h2><p>Now all of the necessary LEMP stack parts installed. Yet still, need to make a couple of configuration changes so as to tell Nginx to utilize the PHP processor for dynamic content.</p><p>This is done on the server block level (server blocks are like Apache's virtual hosts).&nbsp;To do this, navigate to <code>/etc/nginx/sites-available/</code> directory.</p><p>Let's say our domain name is <code>example.com</code>. So, here I will create the new server block configuration file is named <code>example.com</code>, although you can name it whatever you’d like:</p><div><pre><code>sudo vi /etc/nginx/sites-available/example.com</code></pre></div><p>Add the following snippet, which was taken and somewhat modified from the default server block configuration file to the new server block configuration file:</p><p>In the <code>/etc/nginx/sites-available/example.com</code>&nbsp; :<br></p><div><pre><code>server {
        listen 80;
        root /var/www/html;
        index index.php index.html index.htm index.nginx-debian.html;
        server_name example.com;

        location / {
                try_files $uri $uri/ =404;
        }

        location ~ \.php$ {
                include snippets/fastcgi-php.conf;
                fastcgi_pass unix:/var/run/php/php7.4-fpm.sock;
        }

        location ~ /\.ht {
                deny all;
        }
}</code></pre></div><p>This is what every one of these directives and location blocks does:</p><ol><li><p><code>listen</code> - Defines what port Nginx should listen on. In this case, that is port <code>80</code>, which is the default port for HTTP.</p></li><li><p><code>root</code> -&nbsp; Defines the website root path.<br></p></li><li><p><code>index</code> -&nbsp; prioritize serving files named <code>index.php</code><br></p></li><li><p><code>server_name</code> -&nbsp;server’s domain name or public IP address.<br></p></li><li><p><code>location / </code>-&nbsp;It has a <code>try_files</code> directive, which checks for the existence of files matching a URI request. If Nginx cannot find it, then it will return a 404 error.<br></p></li><li><p><code>location ~ \.php$</code> -&nbsp;In this location block, it is pointing Nginx to the <code>fastcgi-php.conf </code>configuration file and the <code>php7.4-fpm.sock</code> file to handle PHP processing.<br></p></li><li><p><code>location ~ /\.ht</code> -&nbsp;This location block tells the Nginx to do not server <code>.htaccess</code> files by using the <code>deny all</code> directive.</p></li></ol><p>After adding this snippet, save and close the file.</p><p>The next  step is to create a symbolic link from <code>/etc/nginx/sites-available/example.com</code> to the <code>/etc/nginx/sites-enabled/example.com</code> to enable this server block.</p><div><pre><code>sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/example.com /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/</code></pre></div><p>Test your new configuration file for syntax errors by following command:</p><p>If any errors are reported, go back and recheck your configuration file before continuing.</p><p>When you are ready, reload Nginx for the changes to take effect:</p><div><pre><code>sudo systemctl reload nginx</code></pre></div><p>This concludes the installation and configuration of your LEMP stack.</p> </div></div>]]>

						<p>Taking a photo of a snowflake doesn't sound too difficult. That is until you actually set off to get these quick-melting wonders of nature to stay frozen for your sensitive high resolution equipment. To capture the beauty of its minutae, photographer Nathan Myhrvold travelled to Fairbanks, Alaska, and Yellowknife, Northwest Territories, Canada.</p><figure><img src="https://smosa.com/content/images/2020/12/Nathan-Myhrvold-Portrait.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://smosa.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/12/Nathan-Myhrvold-Portrait.jpg 600w, https://smosa.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/12/Nathan-Myhrvold-Portrait.jpg 1000w, https://smosa.com/content/images/size/w1600/2020/12/Nathan-Myhrvold-Portrait.jpg 1600w, https://smosa.com/content/images/2020/12/Nathan-Myhrvold-Portrait.jpg 1667w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Nathan Myhrvold / Modernist Cuisine Gallery, LLC</figcaption></figure><p>Myhrvold's strongest snowflakes were found at temperatures between-15 and-20 °F (-26 to-29 °C). It is difficult to capture the picture of a snowflake because of their scale and vulnerability.</p><p>The photographer, chef, scientist and author Nathan Myhrvold is a former Microsoft technology leader. He draws on his physicist training to push photographic boundaries. Using his passions for food, research, and creativity, he and his team are developing custom cameras, robots, microscopes and software for the development of unique photographic perspectives.</p><figure><img src="https://smosa.com/content/images/2020/12/No-Two-Alike.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://smosa.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/12/No-Two-Alike.jpg 600w, https://smosa.com/content/images/2020/12/No-Two-Alike.jpg 958w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>"No Two Alike" Nathan Myhrvold / Modernist Cuisine Gallery, LLC</figcaption></figure><p>Snow crystals are only a few millimeters long. Snowflakes are grouped according to shape. Sector plates, stellar dendrites, and fernlike stellar dendrites are on full display in the crystals in these photos. They melt and sublimate, which over time degrades the sharp characteristics of the crystal structure. Time, temperature, weather and equipment, for a photographer, make snowflakes such a delicate subject.</p><figure><img src="https://smosa.com/content/images/2020/12/Yellowknife-Flurry.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://smosa.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/12/Yellowknife-Flurry.jpg 600w, https://smosa.com/content/images/2020/12/Yellowknife-Flurry.jpg 958w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>"Ice Queen" Nathan Myhrvold / Modernist Cuisine Gallery, LLC</figcaption></figure><p>Myhrvold spent about 18 months designing and building a custom snowflake camera. It uses a Phase One sensor (100MP) adapted to a microscope objective. The camera is paired with short-pulse, high-speed LED lights, typically used for industrial purposes. &nbsp;The camera has a minimum shutter speed of 500 microseconds. &nbsp; It is the highest-resolution snowflake &nbsp;camera in the world.</p><figure><iframe width="612" height="344" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6BO-cbyc2SQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><figcaption>Nathan Myhrvold / Modernist Cuisine Gallery, LLC</figcaption></figure><p>Myhrvold is the founder of Modernist Cuisine, author of <em>The Photography of Modernist Cuisine, </em>and coauthor of &nbsp;<em>Modernist Cuisine: The Art and Science of Cooking</em>, <em>Modernist Cuisine at Home</em>, <em>Modernist Bread. </em>He also has a new work coming out called <em>Modernist Pizza</em>.</p><p><em>Cover Photo: "Yellowknife Flurry" Nathan Myhrvold / Modernist Cuisine Gallery, LLC.

<p>As far as I can remember, I’ve always had a disdain towards Apple products. Something about buying a laptop with poor thermals, a restrictive operating system, and a $1400 price tag just didn’t sit right with me. I was more content using my beat-up Thinkpad with Linux installed. </p>



<p>But 2020 has been an interesting year. So it would be fitting that 2020 would be the first year that I would venture out to buy a new laptop and somehow settle on choosing the new M1 Macbook Air. After using it for the past few weeks, I could not be happier. However, this got me thinking. How did Apple convince me (a staunch critic of Apple products) to buy a Mac?</p>



<p>After retracing my steps, I realized it was primarily due to their copywriting. As an engineer, I’ve only recently started to realize how important copywriting is when selling anything. Apple’s recent campaign around the new M1 Macs has been nothing short of spectacular and as engineers, I feel like there 2 key takeaways we all can learn from them. </p>



<h2>Talk About Impact And Not Numbers</h2>



<p>Two years ago I had just started my own startup that was highly technical. We were building computer vision algorithms to empower minimally trained medical professionals to do oral disease screenings. Our team was filled with engineers who were always striving to grow our accuracy so we could improve the value of our product. </p>



<p>This mentality carried over to our marketing materials, from our website to our sales deck. We had an accuracy of 85% which was about 15% more effective than the current incumbent, and we let everybody know. The number 85 was plastered over everything and we were proud of it. We even showed people how great our F1 Score was in relation to other medical AI companies. Our marketing was heavy on the numbers which we felt accurately demonstrated our product’s value. </p>



<p>However, it never really resonated with customers. Most doctors we were pitching to didn’t even know what an F1 score was. To see how to do numbers correctly we should look at the following marketing material:</p>

<p>Apple showed this graph at a recent event but notice how there are only 2 numbers on the screen. Even the graph has no clearly visible indicators on the y and x-axis (you really have to pay attention to what each axis represents). Instead, it shows the improvement in relation to other chips without blasting the crowd with a series of numbers. Now, this is how Apple communicates this improvement on their website when focusing on potential customers:</p>



<div><figure><img src="https://quixoticnomad.blog/wp-content/themes/veen/assets/images/transparent.gif" data-lazy="true" data-src="https://quixoticnomad.blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2020-12-12-at-3.34.07-PM-1-1024x774.png" alt="Battery Copy Example" width="430" height="324" data-srcset="https://quixoticnomad.blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2020-12-12-at-3.34.07-PM-1-1024x774.png 1024w, https://quixoticnomad.blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2020-12-12-at-3.34.07-PM-1-300x227.png 300w, https://quixoticnomad.blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2020-12-12-at-3.34.07-PM-1-768x581.png 768w, https://quixoticnomad.blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2020-12-12-at-3.34.07-PM-1-1536x1161.png 1536w, https://quixoticnomad.blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2020-12-12-at-3.34.07-PM-1-100x76.png 100w, https://quixoticnomad.blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2020-12-12-at-3.34.07-PM-1-595x450.png 595w, https://quixoticnomad.blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2020-12-12-at-3.34.07-PM-1-1588x1200.png 1588w, https://quixoticnomad.blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2020-12-12-at-3.34.07-PM-1.png 1868w" data-sizes="(max-width: 430px) 100vw, 430px"></figure></div>



<p>Now the Apple marketing team could have used this space to go into the specifics about the power draw of this new M1 chip and how it’s better than the old Intel chips. In fact, this move was wildly criticized by technical reviewers. Most notably Linus Tech Tips said that Apple’s unwillingness to release these specific numbers could be their downfall on this new Mac (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljApzn9YWmk">video link</a>). Yet this Mac has had a great reception and great sales. </p>



<p>So why did this marketing move work? Because Apple focused on how this better power consumption was going to solve the deeper emotional problems of their consumers. In one swift sentence, they were able to communicate 3 very key points. </p>



<p>With “Up to 18 hours of battery life. That’s 6 more hours, free of charge”, the Apple marketing team is able to show how this better battery consumption will increase the overall time you (as the consumer) have during a single charge but also clearly draws the competitive advantage by saying that is 6 hours more than their previous models/competitors. Finally, ending with “free of charge” lets us know that we aren’t going to paying more for this increased efficiency. It’s a powerful sentence that clearly conveys a technical topic like the M1 chip’s power consumption into something more digestible to your everyday consumer. </p>



<p>We see this work again in the following:</p>

<p>This new Mac has great thermals to the point where there is no fan in the Macbook air. However, even without a fan, there is no tradeoff with performance. Again, the Apple team could have used this time to speak about how hot the Macbook actually gets. They could have pulled an MKBHD and used a temperature gun to compare the temperature under different workloads and put this video on their site. Instead, they recognized the real problem is that most people hate the sound of their laptop’s fan cranking away while they are trying to get work done. So rather than getting into the weeds, Apple decided to step back and focus on what pain point they are solving. </p>



<p>How I’ve decided to apply this was taking a step back and every time I saw that we were using too many numbers, I thought critically about what issue we were solving with that number and replaced it with that. </p>



<p>For example, why did health systems care about our device having 85% accuracy? With higher accuracy, doctors were able to refer their patients with more confidence and improve health outcomes. We quickly changed our copywriting to reflect this sentiment. </p>



<h2>Talk Like A Human</h2>



<p>This is something that took me a long time to get past. After going through university, most of my writing became extremely formal. But the truth is no one speaks like that. However, when writing marketing materials, I feel like most engineers default to writing like they are trying to pass a university final rather than talk to a customer. </p>



<p>When you scroll down Apple’s website, it seems like someone is speaking to you. For example: </p>



<div><figure><img src="https://quixoticnomad.blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2020-12-12-at-5.59.45-PM-1024x452.png" alt="ML Copy Examplle

<p>Now this is actually a pretty technical point that Apple is trying to get across. However, they are speaking to us, the consumer, in a super casual tone. They start out with a pretty number centric pitch. However, they quickly pivot to speaking about how this extra speed will help you with your day to day activities. During this part of the pitch, they sound like a normal person. </p>



<p>The light gray paragraph is filled with shortened words (like pro vs. professional) and run-on sentences. They use casual language like “That’s” and casual terminology like “brain power”. If I wrote like this while doing my undergrad ethics class I’m sure I wouldn’t have passed. However, when you see any company writing like this it humanizes them. </p>



<p>This gave me flashbacks to 2 related moments during my freshman year during school. The first moment came when I was walking into my engineering library and saw a desk set up in the entryway. Two students stood in front of it hawking a new app that lets you get discounts on food within Green Street (the most popular street at UIUC). Since they were near the staircase, I had to listen briefly to their spiel before grabbing a brochure and leaving. I never downloaded that app and it soon went under so I’m assuming most people also didn’t download the app. The second moment came my junior year where during a party, a friend of a friend mentioned how he was using this brand new app on campus which let him see food deals. I had built up enough rapport with this stranger where I thought it would be worth checking out this app so I downloaded it that night. I later came to find out that guy was a campus ambassador for that app and it was his job to get students on the app. Even after finding that out, I still kept the app. </p>



<p>So why did I download the app the second time and not the first? Because the first time, I was in a situation where I felt like I was being sold something. Those campus ambassadors had a script and they stuck to it. The second time, I wasn’t actually being sold anything but rather listening to a guy talk about his experience on the app. The difference was very noticeable. In the first case, they were rattling off numbers about how much money I could save while in the second case, the ambassador told me stories about how he got 30 chicken nuggets for 6 dollars or how he was able to get a free meal for his date after finding a buy 1 get 1 free offer at a local burrito joint. </p>



<p>This can be applied to copywriting. The difference between bad and good copywriting is the ability to make it not sound like a sales pitch. If people feel like they are trying to be sold something, they are more likely to put up a wall and not buy anything. As an engineer, I try to write about what I’m working on like I’m telling my friend about it. That way it’s always more personable. Remember, people don’t like being sold to. </p>



<hr>



<p>Apple does a great job of technical copywriting. Their teams are great at taking complex technical advantages and condensing them down into something more understandable. I think we can all learn from them and apply some of their methods to our own side projects. As the saying goes – <em>“Good artists make, great artists steal”</em></p>

While setting goals is a great thing, following through is not always easy. Life gets in the way, and soon enough, your good intentions have become a vague memory.</p><picture><source type="image/webp" media="(min-width: 1100px)" srcset="https://productive.fish/blog/habit-tracking/habit-tracking.webp, https://productive.fish/blog/habit-tracking/habit-tracking@2x.webp 2x"><source type="image/webp" media="(max-width: 1099px) and (min-width: 421px)" srcset="https://productive.fish/blog/habit-tracking/habit-tracking-md.webp, https://productive.fish/blog/habit-tracking/habit-tracking-md@2x.webp 2x"><source type="image/webp" media="(max-width: 420px)" srcset="https://productive.fish/blog/habit-tracking/habit-tracking-sm.webp, https://productive.fish/blog/habit-tracking/habit-tracking-sm@2x.webp 2x"><source media="(min-width: 1100px)" srcset="https://productive.fish/blog/habit-tracking/habit-tracking.jpg, https://productive.fish/blog/habit-tracking/habit-tracking@2x.jpg 2x"><source media="(max-width: 1099px) and (min-width: 421px)" srcset="https://productive.fish/blog/habit-tracking/habit-tracking-md.jpg, https://productive.fish/blog/habit-tracking/habit-tracking-md@2x.jpg 2x"><source media="(max-width: 420px)" srcset="https://productive.fish/blog/habit-tracking/habit-tracking-sm.jpg, https://productive.fish/blog/habit-tracking/habit-tracking-sm@2x.jpg 2x"><img src="https://productive.fish/blog/habit-tracking/habit-tracking.jpg" alt="Illustration of person riding a bike with a kite"></picture><p>A common characteristic that can be observed in successful and highly productive people is that they break down their goals into daily steps or habits and track these habits consistently in order to reach their goals. Indeed, tracking habits is the best way to visualize your progress and change course if need be.</p><p>As a result, to reach your goals, you need to set new habits, ensure they fit into a consistent routine, and track them until they turn into automatic behaviors.</p><p>Are you wondering how to get started? To help you reach your goals and improve the quality of your life, we’ve highlighted below everything you need to know about habit tracking. Good luck ;)</p><h2 id="how-long-does-it-take-to-form-a-habit%3F">How Long Does It Take to Form a Habit?</h2><p>If you’ve ever researched or read about how to increase your productivity, you might have come across the statement that it takes 21 days to form a new habit. Indeed, in 1960, Dr. Maxwell Maltz published a book called “Psycho-Cybernetics,” in which he referred to this number of days based purely on observation of himself and his patients. The book became a best-seller, and the number quickly became a reference as opposed to a simple observation.</p><p>However, according to a <a href="http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.695.830&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">study</a> published by the European Journal of Sociology, it takes between 18 and 254 days to form a new habit. The reason for such a broad time frame is that the time it takes to form a new habit isn’t a ‘’one-size fits all’’ figure. Indeed, it strongly depends on the habit and the person. Some people find it easier to adopt a consistent routine, while others might struggle and take longer to get used to it.</p><p>The bottom line is, to forge a new habit, you need to be consistent and accept that there is no magic number, and forming a new habit will take time, hard work, and commitment.</p><h2 id="what-is-a-habit-tracker%3F">What Is a Habit Tracker?</h2><p>A habit tracker is a simple way to track whether you’re sticking to your daily, weekly, or monthly habits and to measure and quantify your progress over time. There are many different ways to track your habits, from using a bullet journal, a calendar, or a planner to downloading a specific habit tracking app.</p><p>The journey of building a new habit is all about consistency and using a habit tracker is the best way to be successful. Indeed, a habit tracker enables you to keep track of your daily tasks, monitor your progress towards reaching your broader goals, and adjust if necessary.</p><h2 id="what-are-the-benefits-of-using-a-habit-tracker%3F">What Are the Benefits of Using a Habit Tracker?</h2><div><div><h3>Keeping Yourself Accountable</h3><p>Like John C. Maxwell said, ‘’you’ll never change your life until you change something you do daily. The secret of your success is found in your daily routine.’’ Although John C. Maxwell has a point, it might sometimes seem difficult to stick to habits. Indeed, you might be extremely busy, tired, or just not feel like accomplishing the new habits you set yourself anymore. While this can happen, you’re much more likely to push yourself if you’re using a habit tracker, as you’ll be able to visualize what you’re doing and what you’re not doing.</p><p>A habit tracker makes you accountable for your actions as it reminds you of the promise you made to yourself and why you did so. Seeing you’re not honoring this promise might help you get back into your habits.</p></div><div><h3>Keeping You Focused</h3><p>If you live a fast-paced life and have a busy lifestyle, it’s easy to start adding too many things to your to-do list and lose track of your original intentions. You might quickly feel overwhelmed and end up giving up on your habits and goals.</p><p>Creating a habit list on your habit tracker app or bullet journal will help you get clarity on your goals, prioritize them, and break them down into achievable daily habits. As a result, you’ll be able to track and monitor your progress on a consistent basis, keeping your mind focused in the long run.</p></div><div><h3>Keeping You Motivated</h3><p>When you’re down, it’s easy to forget how far you’ve come, how hard you’ve worked, and how much you’ve accomplished so far. Being able to visualize your progress can act as a reminder of your commitment and hard work and help you stay motivated.</p><p>Besides, another reason a habit tracker can be beneficial is that after a few days of marking empty squares, you’ll most likely feel the urge to keep marking them every day. Indeed, manually marking boxes and feeling a sense of achievement in doing so can quickly become addictive and keep you motivated at all times.</p></div><div><h3>Providing Instant Gratification</h3><p>There’s something deeply satisfying about ticking off a box to say you’ve completed a habit. Sure, checking off a box on your habit tracker doesn’t mean you’ve reached your goal yet, but it sure means you’re well on your way! Marking an X on your habit tracker will provide you with immediate satisfaction knowing you’ve accomplished something. And this can feel very rewarding. After all, it always feels good to see your progress in real-time!</p></div></div><h2 id="best-habit-tracker-apps">Best Habit Tracker Apps</h2><p>Now that we’ve established the importance of a habit tracker for success, you might be wondering what the best habit tracker apps are. While there are a lot of habit tracking apps available, we’ve listed below the ones we’d recommend.</p><h3 id="habitica"><a href="https://habitica.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Habitica</a></h3><p>Habitica is a gamified productivity tool. The app features in-game levels reached by accomplishing certain tasks, punishments, and rewards, along with a strong social community to help inspire you and keep you accountable.</p><h3 id="streaks"><a href="https://streaksapp.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Streaks</a></h3><p>Streaks is a to-do list app designed to help you form good habits. You can create up to twelve tasks. As the name suggests, the idea is to create streaks of consecutive days. The fact that if you break the chain, your streak will go back to zero can help hold you accountable.</p><h3 id="productive-app"><a href="https://productiveapp.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Productive app</a></h3><p>Productive is a routine building app designed to help you set new life-changing habits. The app helps you create a personal plan and set reminders. It also features a powerful analytical tool to help you visualize and track your progress.</p><h3 id="habitify"><a href="https://www.habitify.me/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Habitify</a></h3><p>Habitify is a simple habit tracking tool that works by allowing you to set reminders. You can create a reminder, input the task to complete, add the time and the day, and the number of reminders you want to set for this particular habit. It’s a very useful app to use in order to turn habits into automatic behaviors.</p><h3 id="fabulous"><a href="https://www.thefabulous.co/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Fabulous</a></h3><p>This habit tracker is designed to help you create routines and break them down into small steps. A timer will help you visualize how long it takes to complete these steps. The tracker also lets you customize your routine and offers a library of meditation exercises you can select and set as a routine.</p><p>We hope this article will help you set new habits and will provide you with useful tools to reach your goals. Remember, "life is about the journey, not the destination." While reaching a goal is extremely rewarding, so is taking consistent steps towards it.</p></article></div>]]>

                    <p>People love to finish tasks so that they never have to think about it again. That is exactly where the inbox zero came from.</p>
<p>Any unfinished task has been proven to distract you from the task that is at hand. That is why in order to be the most productive, you would have to finish everything that would pop into your mind. This would make sure you are not forced into multitasking.</p>
<p>There are some of the goals that you might not be able to solve in one day. Sometimes an urgent matter is taking all of your attention. How do you stay productive then?</p>
<p>The best trick that I found is breaking up a large problem into small-sized chunks that you could do in an hour. This means that after a chunk is done you have finished your mental battle with yourself on spending time on that problem and you will not think about it until it is the next day.</p>
<p>This not only makes sure that your <a href="https://klimy.co/blog/when-productivity-increases">mind and focus are kept in order</a>, it also means that you are avoiding the procrastination that all of us really despise.</p>
<h2>Inbox zero</h2>
<p>What is inbox zero then? </p>
<p>Inbox zero is a natural way of us striving toward a goal to finish the task fully.</p>
<p>In our daily life, especially if you are dealing with people interactions, your inbox will get bombarded by new messages from colleagues, clients, partners and potential partners. This might start small, but letting even a day go by can let to a huge pile of emails waiting for your attention.</p>
<p>So what is the main goal of inbox zero?</p>
<p>There are 2 psychological ideas playing out. Fear of Missing Out and perfectionist syndrome. The mix is unpleasant and brings distractions into our lives.</p>
<p>Our ultimate goal is to not think about the inbox, no matter what we do and where we are.</p>
<p>I see 2 ways of achieving that.</p>
<ol>
<li>Thinning out the inbox and setting rules.</li>
<li>Working on emails a certain, set time per day.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Thinning out the inbox</h2>
<p>One of the biggest problems of emails is the amount of useless information and prompts that we have to deal with.</p>
<p>It is a war for our attention, and we are losing it.</p>
<p>I proposed a system a while ago, where we separate all of the emails into a couple of folders.</p>
<ol>
<li>A newsletter folder that contains everything that I ever signed up for. This allows me to check out my favourite newsletters whenever I want. This has already been for me a better social network such as Instagram as instead of consuming useless information. I am making my life better with each and every email.</li>
<li>A receipt folder that in the age of online shopping and SAAS is a must, considering the number of invoices and payments we get.</li>
<li>Promotion folder. Something that you would want to check if you are looking to get news on a product or discount on something.</li>
<li>Screening folder. This is where email from the first-time sender end up.</li>
</ol>
<p>All of the folders above have to have muted notifications. They are not important enough to grab your attention.</p>
<p>The newsletter must be consumed on your own term and at the time that suits you.</p>
<p>A receipt doesn’t matter until the tax must be submitted.</p>
<p>A promotion email doesn’t matter unless you are on the edge of your feet, waiting for one.</p>
<p>And an email from someone you never interacted with can wait until the future. If they required your immediate attention, they would have called or messaged you in one of the messengers.</p>
<ol>
<li>The main folder. This contains emails from anyone you already interacted with or whitelisted.</li>
<li>The last chance folder to which you peg some of the emails that are on the verge of being put into our last folder:</li>
<li>The folder of doom. You must never visit this folder. You hide it as far as you can, and you forget it ever existed. Any spam, junk or annoying emailers go into this folder after the last chance folder.</li>
</ol>
<p>The craziest part? Nearly all of the folders that I have been using in the Gmail have been integrated into the base product of Hey!</p>
<p>If I am being completely honest, I am not fully sold on it just yet. I don’t particularly appreciate how it doesn’t allow me to create folders and subcategories. Also, I wouldn’t say I like that there is no such thing as marking email important for the later date, but if you are looking for something that will make your life 100x better, give Hey! a try.</p>
<p><img alt="beach a couple, drone picture" src="https://i.gyazo.com/1b7c8dfc346a75fb6e77ed3f996737f5.jpg"></p>
<h4>Goal</h4>
<p>As you might remember, our goal was to make sure that we are not interrupted and not constantly thinking about the emails that are waiting to be replied.</p>
<p>Take it as a habit to get inbox zero in your MAIN FOLDER daily in the morning.</p>
<p>Believe me, if you set everything up as explained above, you will be getting 10 emails per day maximum.</p>
<p>Now, what about the other folders? The most important after the main folder is the screening folder.</p>
<p>There you can find prospective clients, maybe new friends and acquaintances that you would like to discuss things.</p>
<p>Every other folder is fully yours to explore on your own time. They don’t require any immediate attention and will most likely won’t matter if you don’t open them.</p>
<h2>Timing your emails</h2>
<p>If you are forced by your circumstances(whatever this means) or your company to check every single email, you get, set up a rule that you would only work on the emails 2 times a day for 1 hour in total.</p>
<p>Replying to emails an hour per day already sounds painful. You can adjust that to your liking, but what is most important here is setting up a limit to how often and how long you are allowed to focus on the busy work that others throw at you and not focus on work that is important to you.</p>
<h2>Achieving deep focus</h2>
<p>Coming back to the initial point of humans wanting every task finished.</p>
<p>The most important part of finishing something is actually <a href="https://klimy.co/blog/what-is-your-goal">the first, initial step</a>.</p>
<p>Suppose that step is not taken. Nothing would be achieved. No result would come, and no <a href="https://klimy.co/blog/positive-habits-12-12-2020">real improvement would be noticed</a>.</p>
<p>That is why in order to get to something:</p>
<p>Start now. Get perfect later.</p>

      <h2>Results and their interpretation for the First Kakoune Community Survey</h2>

<p>You’ll find below the results to the (now closed)
<a href="https://s.surveyplanet.com/hYB1V90ul">First Kakoune Community Survey</a>,
as well as general <a href="#takeaways">takeaways</a> derived from them. An interpretation
of the data is also provided when relevant. All the specific questions
(e.g. the multiple-choice ones) that were asked had for objective to shed some
light on a specific point, interpreting the replies is a useful indicator of
whether the contributors to the <a href="https://kakoune.org/">Kakoune editor</a> are
headed in the right direction, are aware of the biggest problems the users
face, and have an accurate vision of how the tool is being used in the wild.</p>

<p>Note that the raw free-writing type answers will not be attached to this post,
as I cannot extract them easily out of the survey platform used for polling.
I also wouldn’t like users to hesitate to be open about their opinions of
the editor in future polls, out of fear that their words might end up being
published (albeit without any identifying information attached to them).</p>

<p>Thanks to the 151 respondents who have donated their precious time to take
the survey!</p>

<p><strong>Note</strong>: There are only a couple of such questions in the poll, but the
percentages in some doughnut graphs are not accurate! The survey platform
fooled me into thinking the number associated with a frequency would be an
index, to facilitate statistical analysis via programming. Those turned out
to be weights for rating computation (second column named
“Rating” on the pictures). Changing the values after the fact in the
survey platform’s interface resulted into the data being corrupted and
unusable, so read the <em>Adjusted data</em> when I provided them, they’re the
real numbers.</p>

<h2 id="the-questions">The questions</h2>

<h3 id="q1-how-did-you-learn-about-kakoune">Q1: How did you learn about Kakoune?</h3>

<p><a href="https://kakoune-editor.github.io/community-articles/assets/img/community_survey_01/question_1-how_did_you_learn_about_kakoune.png">
    <img src="https://kakoune-editor.github.io/community-articles/assets/img/community_survey_01/question_1-how_did_you_learn_about_kakoune.png" alt="Question 1">
</a></p>

<p>Social information sharing platforms are the crossroad that directs users
towards Kakoune, by far.</p>

<p>Hits from the “internet highway” (search engines) have a low conversion
rate in comparison, which could indicate that some SEO work needs to be
done on the main site.</p>

<p>Despite being as big as personal recommendations and web searches, the
“other” category only presents separate, unrelated, anecdotal data points.</p>

<h3 id="q2-have-you-ever-personally-recommended-kakoune-to-a-anybody-in-person-or-online">Q2: Have you ever personally recommended Kakoune to a anybody, in person or online?</h3>

<p><a href="https://kakoune-editor.github.io/community-articles/assets/img/community_survey_01/question_2-have_you_ever_personally_recommended_kakoune_to_anybody_in_person_or_online.png">
    <img src="https://kakoune-editor.github.io/community-articles/assets/img/community_survey_01/question_2-have_you_ever_personally_recommended_kakoune_to_anybody_in_person_or_online.png" alt="Question 2">
</a></p>

<p>Two-thirds of users report having personally recommended the editor to
somebody else. It shows that the tool has a significant enough impact on its
users that most of them would get out of their way to recommend it to others.</p>

<p>However, when stacking these replies with those to the previous question,
we can see that a low percentage of those recommendations have resulted in
a user adopting Kakoune.</p>

<h3 id="q3-how-often-do-you-use-the-editor">Q3: How often do you use the editor?</h3>

<p><a href="https://kakoune-editor.github.io/community-articles/assets/img/community_survey_01/question_3-how_often_do_you_use_the_editor.png">
    <img src="https://kakoune-editor.github.io/community-articles/assets/img/community_survey_01/question_3-how_often_do_you_use_the_editor.png" alt="Question 3">
</a></p>

<p>Adjusted data:</p>

<ul>
  <li>daily: 56%</li>
  <li>rarely: 29%</li>
  <li>weekly: 10%</li>
  <li>monthly: 3%</li>
</ul>

<p>Being branded as a code editor, it’s not surprising that most users report
using Kakoune daily.</p>

<p>Close to one third of users report using it “rarely”, which is an
unexpected outcome. The silver lining could be that those users still find
a corner-case use to the editor on occasion, which apparently cannot be
better fulfilled with any other tools. I’ll take 45 “rarely”s over
45 “never”s!</p>

<h3 id="q4-how-long-have-you-used-kakoune-regardless-of-frequency-of-use">Q4: How long have you used Kakoune, regardless of frequency of use?</h3>

<p><a href="https://kakoune-editor.github.io/community-articles/assets/img/community_survey_01/question_4-how_long_have_you_used_kakoune.png">
    <img src="https://kakoune-editor.github.io/community-articles/assets/img/community_survey_01/question_4-how_long_have_you_used_kakoune.png" alt="Question 4">
</a></p>

<p>Adjusted data:</p>

<ul>
  <li>less than a year: 60%</li>
  <li>a few years (1-3): 32%</li>
  <li>a long time (more than 3 years): 6%</li>
</ul>

<p>A reasonable amount of users have stuck around over the years. Future
surveys will tell us more about the tool’s retention rate, but I’m confident
considering the increasing frequency of discussions in the community (forums,
IRC, reddit etc.).</p>

<h3 id="q5-do-you-use-kakoune-for-work-if-yes-what-do-you-mainly-use-it-for">Q5: Do you use Kakoune for work? If yes, what do you mainly use it for?</h3>

<p><a href="https://kakoune-editor.github.io/community-articles/assets/img/community_survey_01/question_5-do_you_use_kakoune_for_work.png">
    <img src="https://kakoune-editor.github.io/community-articles/assets/img/community_survey_01/question_5-do_you_use_kakoune_for_work.png" alt="Question 5">
</a></p>

<p>Out of 142 respondents, 3 explicitly stated they do not use the editor for
work (in “other”), and 9 did not reply since the question is predicated
on whether the respondent does use Kakoune for work. 92% of users trust
the editor to help them fulfill their job duties. That’s a badge of
honour in itself considering the focus other bigger editors/IDEs (Integrated
Development Environment) place on a self-awarded stamp of work-friendliness,
and the total absence of it in Kakoune.</p>

<p>Another nice surprise is that 5% of respondents who use Kakoune for work
mostly write generic prose with the editor, showing that the editor is a
versatile tool that doesn’t only appeal to programmers.</p>

<h3 id="q6-what-statements-best-describe-how-you-use-kakoune">Q6: What statements best describe how you use Kakoune?</h3>

<p><a href="https://kakoune-editor.github.io/community-articles/assets/img/community_survey_01/question_6-what_statements_best_describe_how_you_use_kakoune.png">
    <img src="https://kakoune-editor.github.io/community-articles/assets/img/community_survey_01/question_6-what_statements_best_describe_how_you_use_kakoune.png" alt="Question 6">
</a></p>

<p>The results are in line with the answers to the previous question. The
resolution of the way users interact with the tool is increased here, as
almost 20% of users have selected two or more statements (different than
“other” or reiterated in the “other” form that they use Kakoune as
a specialised tool, option 2). This reveals that the editor is in fact no
just a uni-dimensional tool, but a convenient utility suitable in separate
situations.</p>

<h3 id="q7-what-is-your-job-title">Q7: What is your job title?</h3>

<p>As a way to compliment the answers to the previous questions (<em>how</em> the tool
is being used), respondents indicated in <em>what</em> capacity they interacted
with Kakoune.</p>

<p>Here are the fields the respondents work in:</p>

<p>Software Engineering: 79%
Student: 7%
Science related fields (data science, mathematics, research…): 5%
Unemployed: 2%</p>

<p>Note that one respondent works as a Musician, and another does programming
as a hobby, proving once again the versatility of the tool.</p>

<h3 id="q8-what-systems-do-you-use-kakoune-on">Q8: What system(s) do you use Kakoune on?</h3>

<p><a href="https://kakoune-editor.github.io/community-articles/assets/img/community_survey_01/question_8-what_systems_do_you_use_kakoune_on.png">
    <img src="https://kakoune-editor.github.io/community-articles/assets/img/community_survey_01/question_8-what_systems_do_you_use_kakoune_on.png" alt="Question 8">
</a></p>

<ul>
  <li>139 respondents use Linux (the poll shows 138, but one respondent used the
<code>other</code> field to specify <code>GNU/Linux</code>)</li>
  <li>of those, 50 use the editor on another system, along with Linux; 35 out
of those 50 respondents use Mac</li>
  <li>99 respondents use the editor on only one system: 89 exclusively use Linux, 8 Mac</li>
  <li>out of the 7 respondents who mentioned using Windows, only one uses it
exclusively, all other respondents declared using it along with Linux</li>
</ul>

<p>The above data helps figure out which systems should be prioritised in terms
of support: most users only use Linux, and roughly half as many exclusively
use Mac.</p>

<p>However, the numbers also reveal that many use Kakoune on several systems
at once, fortunately the most popular combination is comprised of Linux
and Mac, so the previous data point did not hide anything.</p>

<p>A statistically relevant amount of users (&lt;10% in all), albeit comparatively
small compared to the core of Linux/Mac users, uses BSD, Windows, WSL,
Illumos, NixOS. Future surveys will reveal if these populations are growing,
and if support for those platforms should be watched more carefully (even
though any user reporting an issue on any platform they’re using will get
help if possible).</p>

<h3 id="q9-is-kakoune-your-main-code-editor-if-yes-what-other-editor-were-you-mainly-using-before-switching-over-to-kakoune-if-not-what-is-preventing-you-from-switching-over-to-kakoune">Q9: Is Kakoune your main code editor? If yes, what other editor were you mainly using before switching over to Kakoune? If not, what is preventing you from switching over to Kakoune?</h3>

<p>After reading all the replies and taking count, I found that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>75 respondents use Kakoune as their main editor, and stated switching
over from the following editors (5 have not documented that information):</p>

    <ul>
      <li>35 Vim</li>
      <li>18 NeoVim</li>
      <li>9 Emacs</li>
      <li>6 VScode</li>
      <li>2 Vis</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>68 respondents do not use Kakoune as their main editor, and 42 among them
have kindly stated what editor they use instead:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>23 Vim</li>
      <li>6 NeoVim</li>
      <li>5 Emacs</li>
      <li>5 VScode</li>
      <li>2 Sublime Text</li>
      <li>1 RStudio</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The most common reasons that held respondents back from switching over were:</p>

<ul>
  <li>no time or motivation to learn</li>
  <li>difficult to add support for custom languages</li>
  <li>some plugins were not implemented for Kakoune</li>
  <li>too tedious to migrate the user configuration</li>
</ul>



<p><a href="https://kakoune-editor.github.io/community-articles/assets/img/community_survey_01/question_10-do_you_use_third_party_plugins_written_by_the_community.png">
    <img src="https://kakoune-editor.github.io/community-articles/assets/img/community_survey_01/question_10-do_you_use_third_party_plugins_written_by_the_community.png" alt="Question 10">
</a></p>

<p>Two third of respondents do use plugins written by members of the community,
which hints us that there is an ecosystem that delivers useful extensions
to the editor.</p>

<h3 id="q11-do-you-write-custom-kakoune-scripts">Q11: Do you write custom Kakoune scripts?</h3>

<p><a href="https://kakoune-editor.github.io/community-articles/assets/img/community_survey_01/question_11-do_you_write_custom_kakoune_script.png">
    <img src="https://kakoune-editor.github.io/community-articles/assets/img/community_survey_01/question_11-do_you_write_custom_kakoune_script.png" alt="Question 11">
</a></p>

<p>Most users don’t need to write their own plugins, which could mean that
those already available cover the most common needs among the community,
or that they simply don’t need to extend the editor with plugins (it already
“just works”).</p>

<p>I could also be that most users don’t care to implement the features they’re
lacking, and just stick around until somebody else does.</p>

<h3 id="q12-do-you-publish-those-scripts-online-on-github-gitlab-etc">Q12: Do you publish those scripts online (on Github, Gitlab etc.)?</h3>

<p><a href="https://kakoune-editor.github.io/community-articles/assets/img/community_survey_01/question_12-do_you_publish_those_scripts_online.png">
    <img src="https://kakoune-editor.github.io/community-articles/assets/img/community_survey_01/question_12-do_you_publish_those_scripts_online.png" alt="Question 12">
</a></p>

<p>According to the data from question #11, roughly half of respondents
that write plugins publish them online to be used by the community.</p>

<p>This could mean that the average plugin is so small that it’s not seen as
worthy of being published.</p>

<h3 id="q13-what-plugins-do-not-exist-yet-that-you-wish-were-available">Q13: What plugins do not exist yet that you wish were available?</h3>

<p>The replies to this question are quite spread out, with most suggestions
being mentioned only by a single respondent. Here are the ones that appeared
six times, making up the most mentioned suggestions:</p>

<ul>
  <li>support for <a href="https://github.com/tree-sitter/tree-sitter">tree-sitter</a></li>
  <li>better support for the <a href="https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/">Language Server Protocol</a></li>
  <li>an advanced Git wrapper, similar to <a href="https://github.com/magit/magit">Magit</a>
or <a href="https://github.com/tpope/vim-fugitive">Fugitive</a></li>
</ul>

<p>The following suggestions were all suggested 3 times each, and follow the
above in the list:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a diff viewer, similar to <a href="http://vimdoc.sourceforge.net/htmldoc/diff.html">VimDiff</a></li>
  <li>support for the <a href="https://orgmode.org/">OrgMode</a> format</li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/mawww/kakoune/issues/453">code folding</a> support</li>
  <li>better support for fuzzy-matching, similar to
<a href="https://github.com/junegunn/fzf">fzf</a>; one respondent mentioned the ability
not to have to use a multiplexer to open a file found via the utility</li>
</ul>

<p>Among the anecdotal suggestions, here’s a list of those I find interesting:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a browsable undo tree</li>
  <li>a scroll bar</li>
  <li>a set of commands to interact with Git hunks (select, revert etc.)</li>
  <li>a wrapper of <code>:make</code> that handles more error formats</li>
  <li>a merge tool for Mercurial</li>
  <li>an integrated Python debugger</li>
</ul>

<p>Note that some suggestions (not given here) were not entirely relevant,
as they were more of a bug report, feature request of generic remark that
were not related to plugins.</p>

<p>This is useful information, as it helps directing the efforts of contributors
who would want to implement a plugin, backed with data.</p>

<h3 id="q14-in-what-languages-do-you-read-software-documentation-in-on-your-system">Q14: In what language(s) do you read software documentation in, on your system?</h3>

<p><a href="https://kakoune-editor.github.io/community-articles/assets/img/community_survey_01/question_14-in_what_languages_do_you_read_software_documentation_in_on_your_system.png">

</a></p>

<p>The editor assumes that most of its users are comfortable reading its
documentation and user interface in English, which is comforted by the
data above.</p>

I would for example write a basic hamburger menu in HSX/HTML.</li><li>Use HSX for <strong>forms</strong>. Forms are pretty much always a bigger pain written in app code. If you have been living in the Single Page App world for a while, you will realize forms written in normal HTML is not that bad. IHP gives you a convenient way of writing forms with server-side validation.</li><li>Use Elm for the <strong>advanced UI stuff</strong> requiring heavy use of DOM manipulation. Elm shines in writing user interfaces with high complexity. If the lines of JavaScript are getting too many, turn to Elm!</li><li>Do you want the content to have <strong>SSR</strong> for search engine optimization? Use HSX.</li></ul><p>So unless you really want to write a full Single Page App, Elm should be used with restraint in IHP, for only specific supercharged parts of the site.</p><p><strong>Most sites are actually better off outputting just HTML and CSS.</strong></p><h2>Next up</h2><p>I want to take this application further in future posts showing you how to interact between IHP and Elm, and how use Elm within protected boundaries (requiring authentication). Stay tuned if these are topics that intrigue you 😊</p></article></div>]]>

<p>Hi, in this article I will be showing how to create a <a target="_blank" href="https://stylus-lang.com/">Stylus</a> library.</p>
<h2 id="wait-what-is-stylus">Wait what is Stylus?</h2>
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://stylus-lang.com/">Stylus</a> is a CSS preprocessor which has features such as whitespace sensitivity but all that is optional. Kind of like a mixture of SASS and SCSS.</p>
<h2 id="so-how-will-we-do-it">So how will we do it?</h2>
<p>Stylus has a <a target="_blank" href="https://stylus-lang.com/docs/js.html">JavaScript API</a> which exposes a <code>.include</code> function. The <code>.include</code> function allows you to add another path which will be searched when importing.</p>
<h2 id="lets-do-it">Let's Do It</h2>
<p>We will be using the Plugin API of the JavaScript API so it can become a little more organized.</p>
<pre><code><span>const</span> stylus = <span>require</span>(<span>"stylus"</span>);

<span>const</span> plugin = <span>() =&gt;</span> <span>(<span>style</span>) =&gt;</span> {
    style.include(__dirname)
}

stylus(<span>"@import 'my-lib/foo';"</span>)
    .use(plugin())
    .render(<span>(<span>err, css</span>) =&gt;</span> {
        <span>if</span> (err) <span>throw</span> err;
        <span>console</span>.log(css)
    })
</code></pre>
<p>If you have a <code>my-lib</code> subfolder, it will use that and import <code>my-lib/foo.styl</code>.</p>
<h2 id="getting-an-import-all-entry">Getting an Import All Entry</h2>
<p>But, what if a user wants to import everything? Like:</p>
<pre><code><span>@import</span> <span>"my-lib"</span>;
</code></pre>
<p>Then, we can create an <code>index.styl</code> within the <code>my-lib</code> subfolder, and change it to this:</p>
<pre><code><span>@import</span> <span>"foo"</span>;
</code></pre>
<p>So now, if you do this:</p>
<pre><code><span>@import</span> <span>"my-lib"</span>;
</code></pre>
<p>It will import everything from <code>my-lib/index.styl</code>, so make sure <code>index.styl</code> is importing every other file there is.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>So in this post I showed how to use the JavaScript API to create a Stylus library, allow submodules, and allow one main <code>index.styl</code> entry point.</p>

          <h2>How to speed up long-distance HTTP file downloads by 6x</h2>
	  <p><small>10-12-2020</small></p>
          <hr>
          <p>The vast majority of HTTP communications use the TCP protocol to transfer data. TCP connections deliver data in-order and without message loss through the use of retransmits and message buffers. Since buffers need to store all sent messages before they are acknowledged, the maximum achievable throughput of a TCP connection is calculatable by a function of buffer size and latency. In long distance communications, this maximum throughput is often lower than the line speed, slowing down the connection on a line that could support faster communications. In this article we explore what impact these buffers have on TCP connection throughput in Linux for HTTP file downloads, demonstrating performance improvements of up to 6x over Ubuntu defaults on a connection with a 200ms ping.</p>

<pre><code>sysctl -w net.core.wmem_max=2147483647
sysctl -w net.core.rmem_max=2147483647
sysctl -w net.core.optmem_max=50331648
sysctl -w net.ipv4.tcp_mem="2097152 2097152 2097152"
sysctl -w net.ipv4.tcp_rmem="1024000 8738000 2147483647"
sysctl -w net.ipv4.tcp_wmem="1024000 8738000 2147483647"</code></pre>
<p>Running the above script on both the client and server will increase download throughput on long distance at the cost of increased memory usage (up to 8GB of memory allocated across all TCP streams) on both the server and client.</p>


<p>The TCP protocol guarentees lossless in-order communication through the use of receive and transmit buffers, memory dedicated to holding the contents of messages which have not finished processing yet. The receive buffers store fragments of messages received out of order until all preceeding data is accounted for, while transmit buffers store messages that have been sent but are not yet acknowledged, in case they need to be retransmitted. Typically these buffers are allocated a finite amount of memory per-stream by an operating system, and exhaustion of these buffers leads to stalled connections and overall lower throughput.</p>
<p>Latency, the time it takes for a message transmitted to be received, is particularly good at triggering the exhaustion of TCP connection buffers. Every message sent by a TCP connection must be acknowledged by the receiving side before it can be removed from the sender's transmit buffer, which means that even in ideal conditions a single round trip must take place before a slot in the transmit buffer can be freed. If the buffer is exhausted then the sender will stall, since no new messages can be added to the transmit buffer. As such, when sending lots of data long-distance, the maximum achievable throughput is:</p>
<pre><code>buffer size in bytes * (1 / latency in seconds)</code></pre>
<p>This bottleneck, plus the fairly opaque relationship between buffer size, latency, and overall connection throughput, can often make users believe that their internet connection is slow, when really they have just failed to allocate enough memory to take full advantage of the bandwidth they have available.</p>
<p>NOTE: Arrangement of TCP windows is a component of the TCP protocol we will gloss over today. TCP connections communicate their buffer sizes as windows, so that the other end of a connection does not overwhelm them with too much data. On Linux, the window size communicated is decided by the memory allowed to be allocated to a single TCP connection.</p>


<p>In this experiment we demonstrate the impact that TCP buffer sizes have on long-distance TCP connection throughput by configuring buffer sizes on a Linux (Ubuntu) server and client. To do this we download a randomly generated file over a server hosted in Germany from a client in Hong Kong (~200ms ping). Linux allows users to change the minimum, maximum, and default amount of memory allocated to each TCP stream. Most distributions set low limits by default in order to preserve system resources. In our experiment we show that the impact of increasing these values on both the client and server can be quite dramatic, demonstrating up to a 6x increase in HTTP download speed.</p>

<h2>Low Defaults</h2>
<p>This work was motivated after observing that the Debian and Ubuntu default buffer sizes seemed to be set too low. At time of writing the TCP sysctl settings on my Regolith Linux (Ubuntu derived distribution) were set to:</p>
<pre><code>net.ipv4.tcp_rmem = 4096 131072 6291456
net.ipv4.tcp_wmem = 4096 16384 4194304</code></pre>
<p>In simple terms, this allows for a 6MB receive buffer and a 4MB send buffer. Thus, by the formula above our total achievable throughput is:</p>
<pre><code>600000 * (1/0.2) = ~3MB/s = ~50Mbps</code></pre>
<p>This total achievable throughput is a far cry from the potential of our gigabit network, which should enable transfers at nearly 125MB/s.</p>

<h2>Methodology</h2>
<p>We configure two Linux machines (Ubuntu Server), one acting as a client and one acting as a webserver. The server machine has the maximum buffer sizes enabled and a large file to download hosted via NGINX. Both our client and server have 1Gbps internet links, with the client located in Hong Kong and the server in Germany.</p>
<p>For each buffer size we set the client's transmit and receive TCP buffer limit and default to the specified size, but we do not change other TCP settings. For these tests we use the default TCP congestion profile on Ubuntu (cubic) and have default settings for TCP slow start.</p>
<p>To test bandwidth we set the large file downloading with a time limit of ten minutes. As the file downloads we the average throughput. To automate this test we use the following scripts:</p>
<pre><code># run_tests
while read p; do
  echo "# Starting test with $p"
  ./configure_settings "${p}"

  echo "# Sleeping"
  sleep 240

  echo "# Going"
  timeout 10m curl http://dev.parsed.uk/file.data --output /dev/null

done &lt; test.txt </code></pre>
<p>This script sequentially executes the same test with different test configurations loaded from test.txt.</p>

<pre><code># prepare for test
sysctl -w net.core.wmem_default=2147483647
sysctl -w net.core.rmem_default=2147483647
sysctl -w net.core.wmem_max=2147483647
sysctl -w net.core.rmem_max=2147483647
sysctl -w net.core.optmem_max=50331648
sysctl -w net.ipv4.tcp_mem="2097152 2097152 2097152"
sysctl -w net.ipv4.tcp_rmem="$1"
sysctl -w net.ipv4.tcp_wmem="$1"
sysctl -w net.ipv4.route.flush=1</code></pre>
<p>This script sets the TCP parameters for the test. The scripts are available on Github <a href="https://github.com/jawline/tcp-test-configuration">here</a>. We allowed a four minute period between setting sysctl settings and beginning the test to allow for the TCP settings to properly apply.</p>

<h2>Results &amp; Conclusions</h2>
<p><img src="https://www.parsed.uk/images/tcp_graph_original.png"></p>
<p>From our results we see that the TCP buffer sizes have a significant impact on throughput long distance. The maximum throughput observed during testing (21MB/s) was over 6x faster than the throughput for the client with a default configuration (~3-4MB/s). We observe that increases in buffer size correlate with increased in throughput until we reach 64MB TCP buffers. In our tests we see throughput peak at 21MB/s, and see no further gain in increasing buffer sizes beyond this. This is likely a limitation of one of the two servers, or the network that links them together. If our testing was not limited by other factors, we should observe further increases in performance was we increase TCP buffer sizes beyond that. Additionally, note that our testing is not rigerous, we performed a single test at each TCP memory increments and do not control for external factors such as network fluctuations or peak time load at the datacenter. Regardless, the limited testing methodology is still sufficient to show the clear trend of increasing throughput with TCP buffer sizes.</p>
<p>While unbounding the maximum buffer sizes is probably not ideal for most configurations, we suggest increasing buffer sizes to allow for 64-128MB per TCP stream on systems where the memory is available.</p>

<p>BitChute has banned the Nordic Resistance Movement’s <a href="https://www.bitchute.com/channel/nmr/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">official channel</a>, the NRM radio channel and has deleted a large number of videos uploaded by other users featuring the Resistance Movement in what appears to be a mass wave of censorship.</p>
<p>The “free speech” video site replaced the Nordic Resistance Movement’s account with the following message on Thursday:</p>
<blockquote><p>Your channel has been blocked for breaching the BitChute Community Guidelines.</p>
<p>An email was sent to your registered email address detailing the reasoning behind this decision.</p>
<p>If you have not received it, or wish to appeal against the decision, then please&nbsp;contact us.</p></blockquote>
<p>However, despite this claim, no emails have been received to our registered email address from BitChute. In addition, no warnings or notifications about our videos were received by the Resistance Movement from BitChute prior to the ban.</p>
<p>This is not the first instance of BitChute censoring legitimate content on its site. Recently, BitChute blocked a number of popular channels in various countries, forcing users to use a VPN in order to view them. The censorship followed BitChute’s <a href="https://support.bitchute.com/announcements/response-to-hope-not-hate-report-on-bitchute" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">statement</a> in July in which they “encouraged organizations like Hope Not Hate” (a UK-based “anti-racist” organisation) to “help them improve their processes”.</p>

<p>Howdy! Today we come to you with an interesting article in which you will learn more about AWS S3 (or Amazon Simple Storage Service) and how this service can help you today. Also I will go step by step with you to create your AWS S3 account today.</p>



<p>These are the main questions we will answer in the next few minutes:</p>



<ol><li>What is AWS S3</li><li>Why do I need AWS S3?</li><li>How do I create an account on AWS S3?</li></ol>



<h2><strong>1. What is AWS S3?</strong></h2>



<p>Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3 or AWS S3) is an object storage service that provides scalability, data availability, security, and top performance.</p>



<p>Customers of all sizes and industries can use it to store and protect any amount of data. This service offered by Amazon has various use cases including: data lakes, websites, mobile applications, backup and restore, archiving, corporate applications, IoT devices and Big Data analytics.</p>



<h2><strong>2. Why do you need AWS S3 connected with your site?</strong></h2>



<p>Here are some cases where S3 is a life saver:</p>



<h3><strong>You have a website that serves visitors from several countries</strong></h3>



<p>A combination of Amazon S3, Amazon CloudFront and WordPress can be very beneficial. Amazon S3 securely stores your data and Amazon CloudFront transfers images of your site to the customer anywhere in the world. Amazon has global coverage. Regardless of the visitor’s location and his internet speed, the images load impeccably.</p>



<h3><strong>You run out of server space or have high server&nbsp; maintenance costs</strong></h3>



<p>It often happens that the space on the server runs out quickly. When you reach a certain maturity with your site you probably need more space. This process is often one that involves high financial costs. This is because the strategy of many hosting companies is to sell the disk space at premium price.</p>



<p>Here comes into the equation Amazon S3, a dedicated file hosting service. The costs for this service are lower than the costs charged by traditional hosting companies. This way you will have a 100% secure storage server for your files that are delivered on time.</p>



<h3><strong>You serve your visitors video content, pictures, files of any size</strong></h3>



<p>If you are already serving videos to your users, you will notice that those videos take up a lot of space and you usually upload them to YouTube or Vimeo. Now there is also the option to keep them all in the media gallery of your WordPress site.</p>



<p>By connecting Amazon S3 to WordPress you will be able to quietly upload those huge video files without worrying that the server disk space is running out or that you have high costs for web hosting.</p>



<h3><strong>You need increased security</strong></h3>



<p>You will be able to protect yourself from unauthorized access with encryption features and access management tools. S3 is the only object storage service that allows you to block public access to all objects in the bucket or at the account level with S3 Block Public Access. S3 maintains compliance programs such as PCI-DSS, HIPAA / HITECH, FedRAMP, the EU Data Protection Directive and FISMA.</p>



<h2><strong>3. How do I create an account on AWS S3?</strong></h2>



<p>AWS S3 is part of <strong>Amazon Web Services</strong>, just like Amazon EC2 or Amazon Lightsail. To access S3 services you need an AWS account from where you will have access to a multitude of services.</p>



<p><strong>To create an AWS account, follow the steps below:</strong></p>

<p><i>How Chrome stays fresh without getting in your face, and why its on-disk structure is a little unconventional</i></p>

<p>Google’s philosophy on software updates is simple: nobody should ever be using an outdated version of an application. On the web, this is easy to accomplish. When a new version of the software that powers a web site is ready, it replaces the old. <a href="http://www.google.com/corporate/timeline/#homepage-original-prototype">The original Google Search page prototype</a> is recognizable as an ancestor of <a href="http://www.google.com/">today’s equivalent</a>, but it looks different and acts differently. There isn’t a single person in the world today using that 1998 version with its measly 25 million pages, many of which are probably long-gone by now. At any point in time, everyone searching Google is as up-to-date as possible. As the web changes, as features are added, and as the design is tweaked, the world will always be using the current version of Google Search.</p>

<h4 id="whats_chrome_got_to_do_with_it">What’s Chrome got to do with it?</h4>

<p>The same principles that apply to keeping Google Search users current can apply to users of client software. In this context, “client software” simply refers to applications running on your own computer. As with Google Search, the thought is that as client software like Chrome changes, features are added, and its design is tweaked, the world should always be using the current version. Everyone using Chrome should be as up-to-date as possible.</p>

<p>It’s easy to keep Google Search users updated, because all of the search software Google writes runs on Google’s own computers, which are under Google’s control. Keeping Chrome updated is a different story, because the software Google writes runs on your computer, which is under your control. Whenever a piece of software’s author is different from its user, a conflict arises. In this case, the author wants the users to be on the latest approved version, but the user might not want to dedicate time to installing an update, or might not even be aware that a new version is available.</p>

<p>The desire to keep users current is more significant than just keeping everyone on the “latest and greatest” version. As Chrome evolves, it receives fixes for bugs, its speed improves, and it sees new features added. Some bugs might affect stability by causing Chrome to crash or behave erratically. Others might even impact your computer’s security or your own privacy. It’s an absolute priority to deploy fixes for these bug classes. It’s far less onerous to provide support for recent versions than for an arsenal of obsolete versions.</p>

<h4 id="whats_bad_for_the_goose_is_bad_for_the_gander">What’s bad for the goose is bad for the gander</h4>

<p>The traditional approach to keeping client software updated is to offer new versions to users as they become available. Thanks to the Internet’s ubiquity, this is now handled almost exclusively online. At a specified interval, the software might check to see whether it’s up to date. If it’s not, then it’ll offer its user the option to perform an update. If the user agrees, then the update process typically involves downloading the new version of the software, after which it will be installed, replacing the now-outdated version. Generally, the installation step can’t proceed while the outdated version is running, so the user is usually prompted to quit the program while the update is applied. Whether they actually need to or not, some updates even want the entire computer to restart when they’re done installing.</p>

<p>From the standpoint of keeping all users up to date all the time, the big problem with this traditional approach is the word “if.” What happens if the user doesn’t agree to perform the update? Well, nothing. No update is downloaded, no update is installed, and the user continues using the outdated version. I can’t even blame people for not wanting to update. Most users probably just want to get on with their lives, and having to take time out of their lives to quit a program they were in the middle of using and maybe even restart their computer isn’t a very attractive proposition. As a result, they keep on going with their old versions, and they’re periodically irritated when some box pops up to ask them the same question about updating that they’ve already said “no” to countless times.</p>

<p>This traditional approach is bad for me as the author and it’s bad for you as the user. There really shouldn’t be so much tension between us. We figured out a way to improve upon the status quo.</p>

<h4 id="silence">Silence!</h4>

<p>The traditional approach can be simplified by removing the “if” from the equation. By never asking the user any questions like “wanna update now?” and instead always assuming that it’s a good idea to update, the software can stay out of the user’s face, and ensure that the latest version is always present. In a sense, this approach is even easier than asking the questions, because nobody even needs to write the code responsible for asking the user.</p>

<p>This is the first thing that I did when implementing Mac Chrome’s updater. It turned out to be a huge mistake.</p>

<p>Recall that in order to apply an update, the new version needs to be downloaded and then installed, replacing the old version. What happens if the old version is already running? The new version sort of collides with it in unexpected and interesting ways. Interesting forensically, that is. It’s never interesting in a way that I’d want a user to experience.</p>

<p>In Mac Chrome’s case, quietly installing an update in the background while the program was running interacted very poorly with Chrome’s <a href="http://blog.chromium.org/2008/09/multi-process-architecture.html">multi-process architecture</a>. Chrome’s IPC <a href="http://an.enduringcolumn.com/2011/03/of-hacks-and-helpers.html#ping_pong">ping-pong game</a> relies on the browser, renderer, and other processes being able to communicate with one another. Since they’re all part of the same application, they expect to be able to communicate in a common language, and this language is specific to each version of the application. But if you’re running browser version 4, and behind your back, Chrome is updated to version 5, the next time the browser tries to start a renderer, it’ll start a version 5 renderer. Renderer 5 can’t figure out what Browser 4 wants from it, and Browser 4 has no way to start up Renderer 4, so you’re stuck running version of Chrome that really can’t do anything at all. The only workaround is to quit Chrome and restart it, by which I mean quit Browser 4 and launch Browser 5, which does know how to talk to Renderer 5.</p>

<p>Since the update was performed silently, in the background, and without any way to prevent it, this system just interrupted you without any warning, and didn’t even provide a clear indication that you could recover by restarting the application. This is certainly worse than the problem that we were trying to solve.</p>

<p>Traditional update systems get around this problem by asking the user to quit the program in order to apply the update, but I’m imposing a design constraint:  I don’t ever want to ask the user anything. Some update systems download the update and then wait to install it until the user quits the program or next tries to start it, but this approach means that the user winds up having to wait for the update to be installed, and I don’t ever want anyone to have to wait for me.</p>

<h4 id="peace_and_quiet">Peace and Quiet</h4>

<p>Ultimately, the solution to the update problem was simple, if not unconventional. Instead of replacing the old version of the application with the new one, the new version is installed alongside the old. If you happened to be running the old version when the new one was installed, it would be able to continue running without experiencing any interruptions. If it was Browser 4, then when it needed a renderer, it would still get Renderer 4, and the two would be able to conduct intelligent discourse. A subsequent launch of Chrome would get you version 5.</p>

<p>I was able to make this work by leveraging the fact that Mac applications are really bundles. A application bundle is a directory that can contain everything it needs to function, and it’s represented to users as a single self-contained icon. All I had to do was take the framework, which is where all of the interesting parts of the program live anyway, as I <a href="http://an.enduringcolumn.com/2011/03/of-hacks-and-helpers.html#framers_at_work">described in a previous article</a>, and put it into what I call the “versioned directory.” If you poke around inside the innards of the Chrome application bundle on the Mac, you’ll find this “versioned directory” inside <samp>Contents/Versions</samp>. Each new version of Chrome gets its own versioned directory.</p>

<p>When you start Chrome, <samp>dyld</samp>, the Mac OS X loader, sees that it also needs to load the framework. The main executable program specifies the framework to the loader by its precise location within the versioned directory. In the this example, <samp>dyld</samp> will look for the framework in <samp>Contents/Versions/12.0.712.0</samp>:</p>

<pre>mark@rj bash$ otool -L 'Google Chrome.app/Contents/MacOS/Google Chrome'
Google Chrome.app/Contents/MacOS/Google Chrome:
        @executable_path/../Versions/<b>12.0.712.0</b>/Google Chrome Framework.framework/Google Chrome Framework (compatibility version 712.0.0, current version 712.0.0)
        /usr/lib/libstdc++.6.dylib (compatibility version 7.0.0, current version 7.4.0)
        /usr/lib/libgcc_s.1.dylib (compatibility version 1.0.0, current version 1.0.0)
        /usr/lib/libSystem.B.dylib (compatibility version 1.0.0, current version 111.1.4)</pre>

<p>Evidently, I’ve got version 12.0.712.0 installed, and a quick check of the About box confirms that this is the version I’m actually running. Now take a look at the versioned directories:</p>

<pre>mark@rj bash$ ls -l 'Google Chrome.app/Contents/Versions'
total 0
drwxr-xr-x  4 root  wheel  136 Mar 18 23:02 <b>11.0.696.16</b>
drwxr-xr-x  4 root  wheel  136 Mar 23 06:05 <b>12.0.712.0</b></pre>

<p>I’ve got versions 12.0.712.0 and 11.0.696.16 installed. I’m running 12.0.712.0 and am not using the older version at all any more, but when the update to 12.0.712.0 occurred, I had been actively using 11.0.696.16, so the older versioned directory couldn’t have been removed at that time.</p>

<h4 id="cleaning_up">Cleaning Up</h4>

<p>The <a href="http://src.chromium.org/viewvc/chrome/trunk/src/chrome/installer/mac/keystone_install.sh?revision=50146&amp;view=markup">update procedure</a> itself is responsible for removing old versions, but it’s very careful not to remove any versioned directories that look like they might be in use when an …</p></div></div>

<p>Believe it or not, the humble ASX is actually pretty damn big – as of December 4th, it has a market cap of $2,466,617,359,800. If you find that number to be a little difficult to parse, try writing it in text: <em>two-trillion-four-hundred-and-sixty-six-billion-six-hundred-and-seventeen-million-three-hundred-and-fifty-nine-thousand-eight-hundred-dollars. </em></p>



<p>Below is a bubble chart showing all 2193 companies currently listed on the ASX sized in proportion to their market cap. You can hover over individual bubbles to see the full name of the company and its market cap. </p>







<p>As the bubble chart indicates, the vast bulk of the ASX is made up of just a handful of companies. In fact, the top 27 companies, a mere 1.2% of the ~2200 listed, account for over 50% of the total market cap:</p>







<p>The ASX 300, or 300 biggest companies by market cap, accounts for over 91% of the total, which is what popular index funds like VAS track; rather than buying shares in all 2193 companies, they just buy the biggest few hundred because the vast majority of publicly listed companies are such ‘small fish’. Small fish of course being a relative term – a company needs to be worth close to a billion dollars to make it into the ASX 300.</p>



<p>For example, The Reject Shop (TRS) with its 350 stores and nearly 6000 employees has a market cap of a mere $273 million, putting it in 557th place, not even on the radar of a typical index fund, and completely dwarfed by the current top dog, CBA: </p>







<p>Sadly the label won’t actually fit on The Reject Shop’s circle above because of its relative size to The Commonwealth Bank. </p>



<p>But don’t let that go to your head, CBA holders. You’re a big fish in a small pond, but you’re a tiny fish in a big pond. Plankton, really. Here’s the ASX next to Apple, the world’s largest publicly traded company:</p>







<p>Yes, you’re seeing that right – Apple is about 20% larger than the combined market cap of every Australian company put together. Here’s how things look when we add in 7 more of the world’s largest companies:</p>







<p>All of Australia’s public companies put together are roughly equivalent to a Microsoft or an Amazon, but significantly smaller than both Apple and Saudi Arabia’s ARAMCO. </p>



<p>Finally, here’s how the ASX looks next to some other exchanges.</p>







<p>As the visualisation shows, the ASX’s total 2.4T market cap pales into insignificance compared to the 38T and 17.4T market caps of the NYSE and Nasdaq. </p>



<p>According to the World Federation of Exchanges, the collective market capitalisation of the world’s stock exchanges is around 95 trillion US dollars, meaning the entire ASX represents well under 2% of the planet’s publicly listed companies.</p>

      <h2>What's all this, then?</h2>
      <p><strong>BLABRECS</strong> is a rules modification for the wordgame SCRABBLE that swaps out the dictionary of real-if-obscure English words for a capricious artificial intelligence. In BLABRECS, real English words aren't allowed! Instead, you have to play nonsense words that <em>sound</em> like English to the AI. These nonsense words are called – you guessed it – BLABRECS.</p>
      <h2>How do I play?</h2>
      <p>Get together your regular SCRABBLE supplies and pull up this page in a web browser. Then play SCRABBLE as normal, but before you play a word, use the "test a word..." box at the top of the page to check whether the AI will let you play it. Remember, you can only play words that the AI approves!</p>
      <p>When you find a legal word to play, hit the "Play It" button to add this word to the lexicon. As you play, you can write in definitions for all the words you've invented in the "Meaning" textbox next to each word. The player who comes up with the best definition for a word can add half of that word's points to their SCRABBLE score at the end of the game.</p>
      <h2>I found a real word that the AI thinks is playable! What should I do?</h2>
      <p>This happens often with proper nouns (which SCRABBLE generally disallows) and with inflected forms of base words that are disallowed. I think you should play by the spirit of BLABRECS and not the letter, but what this means is ultimately up to you. Is the game primarily about exploring the vast "shadow English" implied by the statistical distribution of letter sequences, or is it about the inherent absurdity of an external authority presuming to dictate your language to you? Either interpretation seems valid to me.</p>
      <h2>How does the AI work?</h2>
      <p>Right now it uses a Markov model trained on the <a href="https://www.wordgamedictionary.com/enable/">ENABLE word list</a> used in a number of wordgames. It looks at the statistical patterns of letter sequences in English words and uses this information to determine how likely a sequence of letters is to be a real English word. Then it rejects both real dictionary words and fake words that it deems insufficiently plausible. Check out the <a href="https://github.com/mkremins/blabrecs">source code</a> if you want to learn more.</p>
      <p>I might update BLABRECS to provide a wider range of AI "opponents" using a variety of different technologies in the future. Stay tuned!</p>
      <h2>Why is it called BLABRECS?</h2>
      <p>I generated every possible permutation of the word SCRABBLE and asked an early version of the AI to sort them from least to most statistically likely. BRABLECS won out by a significant margin, beating not only the real word SCRABBLE but also my hand-designed previous title BESCRALB. Then I switched the L and the R because BLABRECS sounds better and I'm not about to let a computer tell me what to do.</p>
      <h2>Who are you?</h2>
      <p>I'm <a href="https://mkremins.github.io/">Max Kreminski</a>, an artifical intelligence researcher and game designer. At the time of this release (December 2020), I'm working on my PhD in Computational Media at the University of California, Santa Cruz. I make a lot of weird stuff with AI; if you want to keep tabs on my work, you can <a href="https://twitter.com/maxkreminski">follow me on Twitter</a>.

<p>On <a href="https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/centos-stream-building-innovative-future-enterprise-linux" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">8th December 2020</a>, the other shoe dropped: the project known as <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.centos.org/" target="_blank">Community Enterprise Operating System</a> (CentOS, and I pronounce it as <em>cen-tos</em>, ypmv), which has been under the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.redhat.com/" target="_blank">Red Hat </a>technology ecosystem, got redefined as CentOS Stream and also where in the ecosystem CentOS Stream would fit.</p>



<p><strong>But first, some background.</strong></p>



<p>In 2002, Red Hat, in response to customer needs for supportable Linux operating systems, Red Hat created Red Hat Advanced Server 2.1 which in 2003, was renamed as <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Hat_Enterprise_Linux" target="_blank">Red Hat Enterprise Linux </a>2.1. This change to a subscription based model of consumption of Red Hat Enterprise Linux, upset the community who have been consuming <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Hat_Linux" target="_blank">Red Hat Linux</a> since the launch of RHL in 1994. </p>



<p>Yes, I was part of that user community that was not happy with the change. And, yes, I did try to see what I could do to continue to benefit from what RHL used to provide in the new RHEL space.</p>



<p>I was not alone in that pursuit. There were many efforts around the world to create a RHL-like system available at no cost to the end user but based on the RHEL code base. The code base of RHEL is available for download because Red Hat complies to and exceeds the requirements of the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.fsf.org/" target="_blank">GNU General Public License</a> of making available the code that goes into a product. [See here for a <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://twitter.com/harishpillay/status/1091319762812977152" target="_blank">twitter thread </a>on how Singtel and Aztech have failed to respect the terms of GPL license of the code running in their products] </p>



<p>Of all those efforts, two of them stood out – <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.centos.org/" target="_blank">Community Enterprise Operating System</a> and <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="http://www.whiteboxlinux.org/" target="_blank">White Box Enterprise Linux</a>. Both projects took the code of RHEL and compiled the binaries from the code so that users can freely download the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_disc_image" target="_blank">ISO</a>s and/or <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RPM_Package_Manager" target="_blank">rpm</a>s and do as they pleased. </p>



<p>There is another distribution, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://scientificlinux.org/" target="_blank">Scientific Linux</a>, maintained by Fermi Lab, that is primarily used by research institutions around the world and is a <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://scientificlinux.org/about/" target="_blank">downstream of RHEL</a> Naturally, anyone is free to use SL for their own uses as well.</p>



<p>In 2014, given the growth of <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.openstack.org/blog/introducing-openstack/" target="_blank">OpenStack</a> and related <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OS-level_virtualization" target="_blank">container</a>-based methods of technology provisioning and consumption, the need for a stable base level operating system became critical for all the innovation that needs to happen. Going through the typical subscription acquisition process would not be useful (or desirable) for the high velocity of innovation that needs to happen. Hence, lots of the OpenStack and container roll-outs were based on CentOS. </p>



<p>The opportunity to help drive container adoption as well as building the next generation of a Platform-as-a-Service that ensures no cloud-vendor lock-in (aka hybrid cloud) took on added impetus. In 2014, Red Hat decided to bring within the Red Hat ecosystem, CentOS – the shoe dropped. The move has a mixed response. There were people who were dead against it (internal and external) but there was something that I felt was good about the idea, given the state of technology then. Also, this acquisition is really an acqui-hire. CentOS benefited very much from the added resources Red Hat was able to provide. </p>



<p>It must be noted that from the beginning of the CentOS project, CentOS was run by a relatively small group of people who essentially were making a distribution that was bug compatible with RHEL. They were not in the business of fixing anything that’s broken that was not already broken in RHEL and when a fix was made available in RHEL, it becomes available in CentOS. There was also no SLA statements or official support offered to CentOS users. They were on their own. CentOS’ website made that very clear. If a CentOS user needs official accountability, they should consider getting a RHEL subscription. </p>



<p>There really wasn’t an open source community of contributors to CentOS – the community was really one of consumers. Not that it is bad, but we need to understand the lay of the land and the people of that land. Let me reiterate – CentOS was never really an open source project like Fedora for example.</p>



<p>Yes, one could find issues in CentOS and provide bug fixes, but these rarely got fed back upstream to RHEL. In many ways, RHEL was a juggernaut that held it’s own because the engineering and QE was done with years and years of experience of doing quality work and strict adherence to stability.</p>



<p>I remember many times, over the years, speaking with customers (CIOs, CTOs, IT Directors etc) about their journey in adopting RHEL and the officially supported Red Hat product portfolio and <s>telling</s> inviting them to contribute features, bug fixes etc to the Red Hat ecosystem. They were all not entirely convinced that Red Hat would accept those contributions as they have never seen anything like that from the proprietary vendors they engage with. But we are Red Hat. And we did have contributions from various customers to the open source products we shipped them. </p>



<p>The same contribution to CentOS, on the other hand, was going to be hard to consider and incorporate in  RHEL because there was necessarily a different mode of existence of both systems.</p>



<p>These customers would also ask me of the “roadmap of Red Hat’s products” and all I needed to do is to point them to the various upstreams of the Red Hat open source products like Fedora, JBoss etc with the caveat that, just because something was made available in the upstream, does not necessarily mean it will also be made available downstream in the Red Hat open source products pantheon. The best way to do that is to get engaged with the actual product teams. </p>



<p>I think it is useful to cite an example. Years ago, a local ISV/SI was providing a solution to a local bank that was going to be running JBoss as their middleware platform. The ISV/SI, instead of working with Red Hat and using the respective JBoss open source products, decided to work with a JBoss upstream open source project (for a discussion of OS products vs OS projects, see my talk <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzbIsa3-8VE&amp;list=PL9tUz4B_AneIkO8pphIiZ8hRS5NIbk1qk&amp;index=28" target="_blank">here</a>).  The ISV/SI used a feature/functionality of the upstream project as part of their solution and when they deployed their solution into production for the bank, it failed – duh!. The ISV/SI was struggling to get is up and running by trying to add the functionality into the product that the bank had and failing. They reached out to us for help. They were fully aware that they were using upstream and that we are not obligated to help. The ISV/SI got their customer, the bank, to contact us for help. Out of goodwill and recognising that the solution being deployed is going to be a mission critical system, we agreed with the customer on the understanding that they will only use the product version in production and not the project version. It was hard to switch over completely, but we worked with both the ISV/SI and the bank customer to make it happen. Herein lies the learning: open source allows you to tinker, tweak and work with the upstream, but one has to always be mindful of what the delta that is between the upstream project and the downstream product. Failing to recognise that is not going to be good for all concerned. </p>



<p>Now let’s fast forward to 8th December 2020. Red Hat and CentOS <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://blog.centos.org/2020/12/future-is-centos-stream/" target="_blank">announced</a> that there will be a change in how CentOS will be working moving forward and that it will become an upstream channel of RHEL to be called CentOS Stream. RHEL will have the primary upstream, Fedora which has a constant six-month cadence in new version release and CentOS Stream side streaming, in a birectional manner, into and out of RHEL. This model will give the open source community the opportunity to contribute fixes, features etc that could get adopted in CentOS Stream and as as result in RHEL. </p>



<p>I think <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://twitter.com/fatherlinux" target="_blank">Scott McCarty</a>‘s <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="http://crunchtools.com/before-you-get-mad-about-the-centos-stream-change-think-about/" target="_blank">post</a> does a very good job in explaining the change and I shall encourage you to read that to understand. </p>



<p>Free and open source software has fed my family and I, helped us move the needle in technology adoption and grown employment within Red Hat as well as enable/empower the greater IT ecosystem – globally. </p>



<p>When I started in 2003, we were about 700 Red Hatters globally and we had exactly one product, RHAS 2.1 aka RHEL 2.1. We were trying to figure out how to make a business selling open source software and, believe me, it was not easy. </p>



<p>Selling subscriptions was not an easy undertaking in the early days (and it has only become slightly easier in the last 5 to 7 years). This was because the IT industry was only familiar with the proprietary software licensing model that you paid a lump sum for the technology and then that’s it. </p>



<p>Keeping the proprietary software business model moving along meant that those vendors had to release new versions every now and then. Each new version was deemed a “revenue event”. </p>



<p>Not so for Red Hat.</p>



<p>As long as you are a subscriber to Red Hat, you get access to everything we have for the product you are a subscriber to including older (but not EOLed) versions and new versions as they get released. I recall Charlie Peters, a <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.redhat.com/en/about/press-releases/press-peters" target="_blank">former CFO of Red Hat</a>, recounting his frustration, during earnings calls (back when we were still listed on NYSE) why a new version release of RHEL (for example RHEL 4 to RHEL 5) was not a revenue event. He had to repeatedly explain the subscription model until they finally got it (or not).</p>



<p><strong>Playing the infinite game</strong></p>



<p>The days after the announcement of the CentOS Stream move has helped me look at the big picture of the vibrancy of open source projects/products. The more I look at it, the more I am convinced that in order to ensure that we in Red Hat can bring to bear quality open source products rapidly with collaboration from customers, that we need to innovate into a model that is vibrant and easy for the community/customers to consume/participate. I see the change from CentOS being downstream of RHEL into CentOS Stream being a sidestream of RHEL as an evolution of the model that is foundationally significant as was the change from freely downloadable RHL to a subscription based RHEL in 2002. </p>



<p>What would now fill the gap that is left by CentOS no longer being …</p></div></article></main></section></div></div></div>

        <p>There’s a resurgence in products using text as the primary user interface.</p>
<p>The most popular tool that uses text as a core UI is probably Microsoft Excel. Excel is a mostly-<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WYSIWYG">WYSIWYG</a> application, but when interacting with formulas and programming cells, the interface of choice for most users is text – typing in formulas as textual information, not clicking buttons. When we want to take the sum over a row, most of us click on the cell and type <code>=SUM(A3:A10)</code> – we don’t click on a “sum” button or unfurl a dropdown menu.</p>
<p>The poster child of textual user interfaces is the command line in the terminal. But I think a new crop of tools, combined with a more tech-savvy market, is staging the rebirth of text as a user interface. Textual interfaces are everywhere in the modern workplace. Slash-commands in Slack and Discord and Notion, hash-tags for channels and tagging, special syntax for searching and querying data across applications, @-mentions in social media and team work environments, and so on. We’re training ourselves to be more savvy users of the <em>textual interface</em>.</p>
<p>
<img src="https://thesephist.com/img/text-interface.jpg" alt="Text as an interface">
</p>
<h2 id="the-forces-at-work">The forces at work</h2>
<p>I think we’re seeing textual interfaces rise in popularity wherever people look for any of the following.</p>
<h3 id="progressive-feature-discovery">Progressive feature discovery</h3>
<p>Text interfaces within graphical UIs gained popularity in places with a high feature-to-visual-complexity budget. In other words, when there’s many more features than can fit comfortably on the screen at once, we hide that surplus complexity behind text options.</p>
<p>In many tools with a high degree of hidden complexity, the average user uses only a small subset of those features frequently. A Slack workspace, for example, might have a hundred slash-commands enabled, but each individual team member may only frequently use 5-10 of those commands on a regular basis. Rather than clutter up the interface with a hundred buttons or a web of dropdown menus, we hide the complexity behind text options, and the user can learn the few features they use most frequently, so they can access them again easily.</p>
<p>This idea applies to tools with a lot of complexity, where any single user might only take advantage of a small subset of that feature set. I think more tools are falling into this bucket as productivity tools consolidate. If a single kind of interface is shared by all business-chat clients, or all product-management tools, or version control software – rather than building custom interfaces for each workflow or use case, why not provide a wide surface area of functionality that’s accessible via text?</p>
<h3 id="extensibility-and-the-portable-interface">Extensibility and the portable interface</h3>
<p>Modern software workflows cross application and service boundaries all the time. Textual interfaces provide an enforceable, rigorous contract between services and applications that can act as the interfaces for apps to integrate with external services, in a way that visual interfaces can’t.</p>
<p>In a software development team, a proposal for a bug fix might flow through a task tracker, which connects with a team messaging app, where an engineer might run a group poll or lead a discussion. The request change might flow back into the task tracker, into a version control system like GitHub, and then deploy automatically to production servers.</p>
<p>Workflows like this require that apps from completely different vendors and domains are able to communicate with each other. More importantly, it requires that the interfaces we use to control these tools be <em>portable</em>. A portable interface carries the same kind of UI across different services, so the user can interact with any service similarly across all of its integrations. Portability means that we can enter data into our task tracker through our chat client, or request the rollout of a change through an infrastructure provider from our version control system.</p>
<p>These integration points are much easier to build, and easier to master as end users, when they all share the same, portable format – text.</p>
<h3 id="automation">Automation</h3>
<p>Textual interfaces make automation trivial, and automation tools much easier to build.</p>
<p>More people are using tools like <a href="https://zapier.com/">Zapier</a> and <a href="https://runalloy.com/">Alloy</a> to automate common business tasks or link very domain-specific workflows together across services. Having a shared portable interface across these apps, and a syntax format that can serve as a contract for how to use that interface, makes it possible for these automation points to communicate to dozens of other services easily. It also minimizes the possibility that a future update to the UI might break an automated workflow.</p>
<p>Text interfaces are much easier for machines to use. And as more work is done autonomously by the workflows we teach machines to perform, text interfaces are starting to matter just as much as human ones.</p>
<h3 id="sharability">Sharability</h3>
<p>People naturally want to document their workflows to remember, share, and iterate upon as a team. To share a graphical workflow, I’d need to record my screen or spend time writing down instructions for how to navigate a visual interface, clicking the right buttons and checking the right boxes. Reifying workflows as text makes this much easier – I can just encode a workflow into a few lines of text input.</p>
<p>In this way, workflows driven by text interfaces are easier to share, document, and iterate over time within a team. Text interfaces make workflows more concrete.</p>
<h2 id="workflows-not-data-are-the-subject-of-innovation">Workflows, not data, are the subject of innovation</h2>
<p>Given these benefits of text as an interface, weighted against the very real cost – text is a more esoteric way to use a computer – why are we seeing a resurgence in this trend now?</p>
<p>I think the easiest factor we can identify is that more people entering the workforce are unafraid of textual interfaces, because they’ve been typing and messaging and tagging their friends online all their life. They already interact with computers via text.</p>
<p>But the second reason that’s driving the industry to text is that <strong>the focus of software services has shifted from manipulating <em>data</em> to manipulating <em>workflows</em>.</strong> We’ve learned how to store and sift through data in our computers as a society, so we’re moving up a step of abstraction, to storing and sharing the how’s of our work, not just the what’s.</p>
<p>Workflows, not data, are the subject of product innovation now. And the subject is easier to study, to compare, to share and extend, when it’s concrete and durable, not an organic, ephemeral series of actions.</p>
<p>I think as long as we’re innovating on <em>how</em> we work, and how the services we use can work together more effectively, text as an interface is here to stay. And why not? The software industry has spent the last half-century building tools to help us wrangle with text, and we can rediscover those tools and ideas again.</p>
<p>We’re entering a renaissance of user interfaces, not in the sense of a novel paradigm shift, but in the sense of a rediscovery of classic, enduring ideas on which we can build better tools and systems. And I, for one, welcome it.</p>

      <h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>

<p>Sometimes, we would feel confused about the difference between a discriminative model and a generative model. This is because the mathematical definition was not explicitly defined.</p>



<p>In this blog post, I would like to discuss the mathematical definition for discriminative model and generative model, and their relationships.</p>

<h3 id="discriminative-model">Discriminative Model</h3>

<p>A discriminative model is a model of the conditional probability of the target variable $Y$, given the observation variable $X$. Symbolically, we are modeling $P(Y|X)$. In laymanâ€™s language, we give an observation to the model, we want the model to tell us the probability for each possible target.</p>



<p>For an example in which $X$ and $Y$ are both discrete, we input a $32 \times 32$ RGB dog image $x$ to the model, and the model will output the probability of each of the targets. There are $|Y|$ targets possible being modeled. We could iterate through the probabilities of all the $|Y|$ targets and find out the maximum one, i.e., $\DeclareMathOperator*{\argmax}{argmax} \argmax_{Y} P(Y|X = x)$, which is the most likely target the model thinks.</p>

<h3 id="generative-model">Generative Model</h3>

<p>I found there are many slightly different definitions for generative model.</p>



<p>In some definitions, a generative model is a model of the conditional probability of the observation variable $X$, given the target variable $Y$. Symbolically, we are modeling $P(X | Y)$. In laymanâ€™s language, we give a target to the model, we want the model to tell us the probability for each possible observation.</p>



<p>For an example in which $X$ and $Y$ are both discrete, we input the â€œdogâ€� label $y$ to the model, and the dog label will generate the probability of each $32 \times 32$ RGB image. There are $| X | = 256^{32 \times 32}$ RGB images possible being modeled. We could iterate through the probabilities of all the $|X|$ observations and find out the maximum one, i.e., $\DeclareMathOperator*{\argmax}{argmax} \argmax_{X} P(X|Y = y)$, which is the most possible dog image the model thinks.</p>



<p>In other definitions, a generative model is a model of the joint probability of the observation variable $X$ and the target variable $Y$. Symbolically, we are modeling $P(X, Y)$. In laymanâ€™s language, we donâ€™t know what we want, we just want the model to tell us the probability for each possible observation and target combinations.</p>



<p>For an example in which $X$ and $Y$ are both discrete, the model modeled the joint distribution of $32 \times 32$ RGB image and different targets. There are $| X | \times | Y | = 256^{32 \times 32} | Y |$ combinations possible being modeled. To find out the most possible dog image that the model thinks, suppose the â€œdogâ€� label is $y$, we could iterate through the probabilities of all the $|X|$ observations and find out the maximum one, i.e., $\DeclareMathOperator*{\argmax}{argmax} \argmax_{X} P(X, Y = y)$.</p>

<h3 id="relationships">Relationships</h3>

<h4 id="generative-conditional-and-joint-distribution-model-definitions">Generative Conditional and Joint Distribution Model Definitions</h4>

<p>The two definitions for generative models are closely related given the definition of joint probability.</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
P(X, Y) = P(X | Y) P(Y)
\end{align}\]

</p><p>This means that if the probability distribution for the target variable $P(Y)$ could be modeled. The two generative model definitions could be converted from each other. Usually modeling the prior $P(Y)$ is not very hard.</p>



<p>When we are only interested in finding out the which observation, $x_1$ or $x_2$, is more likely given an target $y$, it does not matter if we model $P(X | Y)$ or $P(X, Y)$. Because</p><p>

\[\frac{P(X = x_1, Y = y)}{P(X = x_2, Y = y)} = \frac{P(X = x_1 | Y = y)}{P(X = x_2 | Y = y)}\]

</p><h4 id="discriminative-and-generative-models">Discriminative and Generative Models</h4>

<p>Generative models have richer information than discriminative models. A generative model could be easily converted to a discriminative model. This is because of the Bayes theorem.</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
P(Y | X) &amp;= \frac{P(X | Y) P(Y)}{P(X)} \\
&amp;= \frac{P(X, Y)}{P(X)} \\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>where</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
P(X) &amp;= \sum_{y \in Y} P(X | Y = y) P(Y = y) \\
&amp;= \sum_{y \in Y} P(X, Y = y) \\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>for discrete variable $Y$, and</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
P(X) &amp;= \int_{Y} P(X | Y ) P(Y = y) dy \\
&amp;= \int_{Y} P(X, Y = y) dy \\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>for continuous variable $Y$.</p>



<p>In this case, the generative joint distribution model is readily to be converted to a discriminative model where as the generative conditional distribution model still requires to have a model $P(Y)$ although usually $P(Y)$ is not hard to model.</p>



<p>When we are only interested in finding out the which target, $y_1$ or $y_2$, is more likely given an observation $x$, $P(X)$ could be ignored given it is a constant with respect to the target variable $Y$.</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
P(Y | X) &amp;\propto P(X | Y) P(Y) \\
&amp;\propto P(X, Y) \\
\end{align}\]

\[\begin{align}
\frac{P(Y = y_1 | X = x)}{P(Y = y_2 | X = x)} &amp;= \frac{P(X = x | Y = y_1) P(Y = y_1)}{P(X = x | Y = y_2) P(Y = y_2)} \\
&amp;= \frac{P(X = x, Y = y_1)}{P(X = x, Y = y_2)} \\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>A perfect example of applying a generative model to a discriminative task is <a href="https://leimao.github.io/blog/Naive-Bayes-Classifier/">naive Bayes classifier</a>.</p>

<p>Furry Twitter is currently abuzz about a new site selling knock-off fursuits and illegally using photos from the owners of the actual fursuits without permission.</p>

<p>Understandably, the photographers and fursuiters whose work was ripped off by this website are upset and would like to exercise their legal recourse (i.e. DMCA takedown emails) of the scam site, but there’s a wrinkle: </p>



<p>Their contact info isn’t in DNS and their website is hosted behind CloudFlare.</p>

<p>You might think this is a show-stopper, but I’m going to show you how to get their server’s real IP address in one easy step.</p>



<h4>Ordering the Server’s IP Address by Mail</h4>



<p>Most knock-off site operators will choose open source eCommerce platforms like Magento, WooCommerce, and OpenCart, which usually have a mechanism for customers to register for an account and login.</p>



<p>Usually this mechanism sends you an email when you authenticate.</p>



<p>(If it doesn’t, logout and use the “reset password” feature, which will almost certainly send you an email.)</p>



<p>Once you have an email from the scam site, you’re going to need to view the email headers.</p>



<p>With Gmail, can click the three dots on the right of an email then click “Show original”.</p>

<p>And there you have it. The IP address of the server behind CloudFlare delivered piping hot to your inbox in 30 minutes or less, or your money back.</p>



<p>That’s a fairer deal than any of these knock-off fursuit sites will give you.</p>

<h3>What Can We Do With The Server IP?</h3>



<p>You can identify who hosts their website. (In this case, it’s a company called Net Minders.)</p>



<p>With this knowledge in mind, you can send an email to their web hosting provider, citing the Digital Millennium Copyright Act.</p>



<p>One or two emails might get ignored, but discarding hundreds of distinct complaint emails from different people is bad for business. This (along with similar abuse complaints to the domain registrar, which isn’t obscured by DNS Privacy) should be enough to shut down these illicit websites.</p>

<p>I wasn’t really paying attention, so maybe I’m the only one that hadn’t noticed, but Tesla’s market cap as of December 9th 2020 is a touch over 616 billion US dollars. That makes it kind of a big deal. In fact, it accounts for a full third of the global automaker market cap:</p>







<p>Just for a bit of context – Tesla only listed on the stock market 10 years ago (June 2010). The company itself was only founded in 2003. Compare that to Ford which launched in 1903 and basically invented the concept of mass production (the Model T is still one of the best selling cars of all time) or Benz in 1889, whose founder, Karl Benz, literally had a patent on the original goddamn automobile. </p>



<p>Here’s a racing bar chart of a few of the top automakers share prices over the last couple of decades. Tesla both literally and figuratively comes out of nowhere (spoiler alert: things get insane in 2019):</p>







<p>As you can see from the chart, the share price has pretty much 10x’d over the last 12 months. Why? Well, it’s certainly not because Tesla is making 10 times the revenue or shipping 10 times as many cars. In all of 2019, for example, Tesla shipped 367,500 cars. In Q3, 2020, they shipped 139,300 cars, giving them a run rate of around 550,000 cars for the entire year. For context, <strong>Toyota sold 927,623 cars in October 2020 alone</strong> (<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://global.toyota/en/company/profile/production-sales-figures/" target="_blank">source</a>). </p>



<p>Here’s how Tesla compares to some of the automakers mentioned above in terms of yearly car sales:</p>







<p>No, I didn’t forget to add Tesla to the chart – you just can’t see the label because of how tiny the sales numbers are relative to other automakers (it’s that little blue sliver between Volkswagen and BMW if you still haven’t found it).</p>



<p>As you’d expect from the huge disparity in car sales shown above, Tesla’s revenues are also dwarfed by the bigger incumbents. Expected 2020 revenues are around 28 billion USD – impressive, but more than an order of magnitude less than VW’s 299 billion USD in 2019. </p>







<p>So why does the market have such a hard on for Tesla? As the chart above shows, Tesla’s market cap seems to be completely out of whack with its revenues and earnings (the latter was just 10 million USD in 2019). </p>



<p>The simple answer is that the market is valuing the VW’s, Toyota’s, and Daimler’s of the world on what they are – car companies. Tesla, on the other hand, is being valued as a tech business, and therefore what it *could* be. Car companies are boring and predictable. Technology companies though… Well, they have pretty much unlimited upside, don’t they?</p>



<p>Here are a few things Tesla has going for it.</p>



<ul><li>First, and most obviously, the electric car market is really just getting started. There are close to 100 million new cars per year sold globally, and less than 1% of them are electric, though this number is growing quickly – <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-autos-electric-idUSKBN27C08C">it’s already 5% in China</a> – and expected to surpass 50% in most developed nations by 2030. There is even some talk of the UK and EU <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.smh.com.au/world/europe/build-back-greener-boris-johnson-bans-petrol-cars-by-2030-20201119-p56fwn.html" target="_blank">banning sales</a> of new petrol and diesel cars in the not too distant future.<p>Tesla clearly has a first mover advantage here, and a lead on battery technology and EV engineering, though the quantum of this lead is <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.barrons.com/articles/tesla-battery-technology-electric-vehicles-engineering-51592842119" target="_blank">disputed</a>. </p></li><li>Tesla may be the first company to actually nail self-driving. After overpromising and underdelivering for years (in 2015, Musk predicted FSD could arrive by 2018), Tesla Full Self Driving appears to have <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://cleantechnica.com/2020/12/07/tesla-full-self-driving-speed-bumps-cyclists-no-destination-lane-centering-with-on-street-parking-videos/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://cleantechnica.com/2020/12/07/tesla-full-self-driving-speed-bumps-cyclists-no-destination-lane-centering-with-on-street-parking-videos/" target="_blank">launched in beta</a> for some drivers, though early reports of its reliability are mixed.<br></li><li>Revenue growth to date. Sure, as we can see in the above chart, total revenues are still only a fraction of VW’s and Toyota’s, but 10 years ago Tesla had revenues of 100m USD compared to 2020’s projected 28B USD – that’s a roughly 28 fold increase. In the same period, VW’s revenue has increased by about 75%, and Toyota’s by only around 30%.<br></li><li>Well placed in solar and home energy storage. <br></li><li>The Tesla brand is cool, the Elon Musk brand is cool </li></ul>



<p>And finally, Tesla is, for pretty much the first time in its history doing something many of its critics said it would never do – <strong>actually turning a profit</strong>. The 10 million USD profit it made in 2019 was for all intents and purposes breaking even (and was driven largely by sale of regulatory credits), but in 2020 expected profits are a meaty looking 1.26B USD.</p>
