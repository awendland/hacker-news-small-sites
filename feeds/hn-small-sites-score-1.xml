			<p>For more than half a decade, Popcorn Time has been a thorn in the side of Hollywood. </p>
<p>The ‘Netflix for Pirates’ offers an easy-to-use application that opens the door to a library of thousands of streamable movies and TV-shows. </p>
<p>The Motion Picture Asociation (MPA) recognized this threat early on and pressured the original developers to throw in the towel. That worked, but it came too late as the open-source project was swiftly revived by others.</p>
<p>Today, Popcorn Time lives on through many project forks. The most popular is PopcornTime.app, which like its predecessor, <a href="https://github.com/popcorn-official" target="_blank">shares its source code publicly</a> on the developer hosting platform GitHub. This allows others to download, modify, and share it. </p>
<p>The MPA is not happy with this and took action recently. The movie industry group <a href="https://torrentfreak.com/mpa-suggests-github-could-be-held-liable-for-popcorn-times-copyright-infringements-200505/" target="_blank">informed GitHub</a>, which is owned by Microsoft, about the infringing nature of the software. According to the MPA, the application includes links to pirate sites, pirate APIs, and pirate torrent trackers, which are used to download pirated movies and TV-shows.</p>
<center><img src="https://torrentfreak.com/images/mparequest.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="354" srcset="https://passivetech.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/cd1cc7f20aa83c5321df90abe40fe86c.jpg 625w, https://torrentfreak.com/images/mparequest-600x424.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20500%20354'%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-lazy-srcset="https://passivetech.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/cd1cc7f20aa83c5321df90abe40fe86c.jpg 625w, https://torrentfreak.com/images/mparequest-600x424.jpg 600w" data-lazy-src="https://torrentfreak.com/images/mparequest.jpg"></center>
<p>On top of that, the MPA suggested that GitHub itself may be liable for copyright infringement if the company fails to take action. </p>
<p>While the MPA’s interpretation of the law is likely not shared by GitHub, the company did remove the Popcorn Time code. In most cases that would be the end of the story, but Popcorn Time was not backing off without a fight. </p>
<p>The developers submitted a DMCA counternotice explaining that the MPA’s request is not legitimate. The code is owned by Popcorn Time, not the MPA, and Popcorn Time asked GitHub to restore access. </p>
<p>“The code is 100 % ours and do not contain any copyright [sic] material please check again,” the <a href="https://github.com/github/dmca/blob/d7f4a6a3aade92999d4d86962972c4b27af820e3/2020/05/2020-05-04-MPA-counternotice.md" target="_blank">developer wrote</a>.</p>
<p>The app’s developers made a good point here. The identified code (not the built app) is not directly copyright infringing and it contains no direct links to copyright-infringing material either. This means that a DMCA notice may not be the right tool here.</p>
<p>Faced with both requests, GitHub has now decided to restore full access to the Popcorn Time repository. </p>
<p>This decision doesn’t necessarily mean that it agrees with the app developers, however. The DMCA simply prescribes that, following a counternotice, content can be restored after two weeks, unless the claiming party files a lawsuit. </p>
<center><img src="https://torrentfreak.com/images/popcorngit.jpg" alt="" width="590" height="451" srcset="https://passivetech.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/6bbe8d7f2ef64e3124e0ef0005129d46.jpg 1101w, https://torrentfreak.com/images/popcorngit-600x459.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 590px) 100vw, 590px" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20590%20451'%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-lazy-srcset="https://passivetech.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/6bbe8d7f2ef64e3124e0ef0005129d46.jpg 1101w, https://torrentfreak.com/images/popcorngit-600x459.jpg 600w" data-lazy-src="https://torrentfreak.com/images/popcorngit.jpg"></center>
<p>In this case, the MPA chose not to file a lawsuit against the Popcorn Time operators, so the code repositories are back online again. </p>
<p>Whether the MPA will follow-up with further action has yet to be seen. However, the whole episode highlights an interesting issue. There is little doubt that the Popcorn Time application is a pirate app. However, the code, as hosted by GitHub, is not infringing per se. As such, regular takedown notices don’t appear to work here.</p>

<![CDATA[Creating Effective Tutorials for Your Dev Team]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-v-75e492e5="" data-v-61c0ab88=""><div><p>Creating tutorials for your codebase is not an intuitive task for many teams. How to tackle it? What makes for a good tutorial? How do we measure the effectiveness of a code tutorial correctly?</p>
<p>We covered dozens of tutorials and approaches at different companies and organisations, and here are the 5 elements we found every code tutorial has to have. We’re willing to go as far off and say: if your onboarding tutorials do not meet the following criteria - you probably shouldn’t bother creating them in the first place.</p>
<h2>What Makes a Code Tutorial Effective?</h2>
<p>While providing your engineers with code tutorials can be a time consuming task for everyone, tutorials pose some innate benefits that will help keep your onboarding programs effective and sustainable and internal knowledge sharing levelled up.</p>
<p><strong>Great code tutorials are:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Focused - highlighting just the part of the repo which your engineer needs to learn to get started. If the readers need to look through dozens of paragraphs to find what they were looking for, they might not even bother searching. In other words, tutorials are not like your history essay from high-school - You lose points for length and breadth.</li>
<li>Highlight the “Why”. They show a clear explanation of the logic behind the code and/or why it is like it is now.</li>
<li>They show a process rather than the mere solution. It’s much easier to understand code by seeing the process of its creation or the flow of information, rather than just looking at a freeze frame of what it looks like now.</li>
<li>Tinkering - they enable a sandbox experience or learning by doing. It’s similar to getting thrown a task from the backlog in the sense that it is hands on, however it is structured, and guided in a way that evokes deductively understanding codebase logic, and also does not require the time and investment a backlog task would.</li>
<li>Up to date. They have to be practical and up to date with the current code. What usually kills good tutorials is if they are outdated. Not only will they waste the reader’s time, they might cause actual damage by misleading. This is the number one reason that many engineers distrust tutorials, and documentation in general.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Recap</h2>
<p>Good tutorials are hard to make and maintain. Although, easier said than done, the key is to keep them updated, focused and encourage an independent learning process. The next step to tune-it up, would be to make sure we measure the effectiveness of our tutorials (more on that in a future post), and gather feedback to improve over time.</p>

These are not the type of ideas that will bring in huge sums of money. No. These are little things you can do every day to earn or save some money to survive a recession, unemployment or any other temporary financial setback.</p><p>If you have a stable job and earn about £100k a year, this list probably isn't for you. This list is for people who've been made redundant and need money to help them get by until they find a new job. It's for a mother who just had a baby, isn't working, and has a couple of hours to spare each day. It's for that person who is curious and wants to know how to make £5 today or £50 tomorrow.&nbsp;</p><p>If this all makes sense, here are my top twelve ideas for making money online to survive a recession in 2020. Note that the examples I used here are specific to the UK, but the general ideas are applicable globally.<br></p><h2><strong>1. Online Surveys</strong></h2><blockquote>Get paid to participate in research from universities and companies.</blockquote><ol role="list"><li><a href="https://prolific.co/" target="_blank"><strong>Prolific</strong></a> - The pay is roughly about minimum wage. The more surveys you do, the more you'll earn. There's a Chrome extension that alerts you whenever a new survey is available. You'll need at least a fiver to cash-out, which is roughly three to six surveys.</li><li><a href="https://www.qmee.com/" target="_blank"><strong>Qmee</strong></a> - Earn cash rewards for engaging with brands and for sharing your opinion by answering surveys. There's no minimum payout, and the money goes straight to PayPal.</li><li><a href="https://yougov.co.uk/" target="_blank"><strong>YouGov</strong></a><strong> </strong>- Complete surveys to earn points. You can redeem your points for £50 cash.</li><li><a href="https://surveys.google.com/google-opinion-rewards/" target="_blank"><strong>Google rewards</strong></a> - Complete short surveys and get rewarded with Google Play or PayPal credits. The payout is quite small, so most people use it to pay for things like magazine subscriptions and mobile games.</li><li><a href="https://www.populuslive.com/" target="_blank"><strong>PopulusLive:</strong></a> Earn money for completing surveys. The minimum payout is £50. Payments are made by bank transfer (BACS) or by cheque.</li></ol><h2><strong>2. Cashback</strong></h2><blockquote>‍<strong>‍</strong>Cashback is a service that lets you get money back on goods, services, and travel through exclusive partnerships with brands and leading retailers. For example, if you spent £50 at Tesco and got a 10% cashback, that's free £5 in your pocket. Here's how to get cashback:</blockquote><ol role="list"><li><strong>Banks </strong>- Some of the big banks offer cashback to their customers. Check your mobile app or online banking to see if your bank offers cashback. Here are a few popular ones: <a href="https://www.barclays.co.uk/current-accounts/cashback/" target="_blank">Barclays</a> (up to 10% cashback), <a href="https://www.lloydsbank.com/online-banking/benefits-online-banking/everyday-offers.html" target="_blank">Lloyds</a> (up to 15% cashback) and <a href="https://www.santander.co.uk/personal/support/understanding-our-services/retailer-offers" target="_blank">Santander</a> (up to 15% cashback).</li><li><strong>Cashback Sites </strong>- These are independent companies that give you money back when you buy from one of their registered retailers or brands. The popular ones are <a href="https://www.quidco.com/" target="_blank">Quidco</a>, <a href="https://www.shopmium.com/uk" target="_blank">Shopmium</a>, <a href="https://ohmydosh.co.uk/" target="_blank">OhMyDosh</a>, <a href="https://www.swagbucks.com/" target="_blank">Swagbucks</a>, and <a href="https://www.topcashback.co.uk/" target="_blank">TopCashback</a>.</li></ol><h2><strong>3. Earn Rewards for your Data </strong></h2><blockquote>With these services, you share some of your data like a scanned copy of your supermarket receipt to earn rewards. Here are some companies that offer these services:</blockquote><ol role="list"><li><a href="https://www.airtimerewards.co.uk/" target="_blank"><strong>Airtime Rewards</strong></a> - This is great for people looking to reduce or offset their mobile phone bills. You need to link your card first, then each time you make a purchase at a registered retailer, you'll earn a reward. You can redeem this reward to your mobile bill.&nbsp;</li><li><a href="https://www.shoppixapp.com/" target="_blank"><strong>Shoppix</strong></a><strong> </strong>- Snap receipts and answer surveys to collect tokens.

Energy Auto-switching</strong><br></h2><blockquote>This one saves you time and money. Auto-switching companies automatically switch your energy tariff to keep you on the best deal. It takes about two minutes to sign up, and it's completely free except you opt-in for a paid plan. Here are the ones we feature on Koody:</blockquote><ol role="list"><li><a href="https://partner.koody.co/switchd" target="_blank"><strong>Switchd</strong></a> - Depending on the size of your home, you could save £400+ a year.</li><li><a href="https://partner.koody.co/LAMB" target="_blank"><strong>Look After My Bills</strong></a> - 99% of new members on credit meters find a saving straight away.</li></ol><p>‍<br></p><h2><strong>7. Smart Savings</strong><br></h2><blockquote>You will hardly make any new money from this idea. Instead, you'll save some of what you already have. Here's how to save smartly:</blockquote><ol start="" role="list"><li><strong>Round Ups</strong> - Some apps like <a href="https://www.moneyboxapp.com/" target="_blank">Moneybox</a> help you save your spare change by rounding up your card transactions to the nearest pound and saving the difference (e.g., if you spend £2.30 on a snack, these apps save 70p for you). Over an extended period, this money adds up and could become quite valuable. Some banks also offer round ups. Check to see if your bank does.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Auto-saving</strong> - Automating your savings saves you time and reduces the temptation of spending above your budget. There are two ways you can automate your savings:<strong>‍</strong></li></ol><ul role="list"><li>~~Do it yourself<strong> </strong>- Set up a standing order to move money from your current account to your savings account every month. This is easy, and you can do it with your bank's mobile app or online banking.<strong>‍</strong></li><li>~~Use an auto-savings app - Some apps will automate your savings by moving money from your current account to an e-wallet regularly. These apps are useful if you want to reduce the temptation of dipping into your savings. Here are a few popular ones: <a href="https://withplum.com/" target="_blank">Plum</a>, <a href="https://www.getchip.uk/" target="_blank">Chip</a>, <a href="https://www.tandem.co.uk/" target="_blank">Tandem</a> and <a href="https://www.meetcleo.com/" target="_blank">Cleo</a>.

Bank Switching Deals</strong></h2><blockquote>Many big banks will offer you money to move your current account over to them. I'm not a massive fan of bank switching deals because it can take several months to receive the bonus. But, if you're a patient person, you should check out the ones below:</blockquote><p><strong>1. </strong><a href="https://personal.natwest.com/personal/current-accounts/select_account.html" target="_blank"><strong>Natwest Everyday Bank Account</strong></a> - £125 switching bonus (available to new and existing customers).</p><p><strong>How it works</strong></p><ul role="list"><li>Pay in at least £1,500 by 15th January 2021.&nbsp;</li><li>Log in to your mobile app or online banking by 15th January 2021.</li><li>Receive the £125 bonus by 12th February 2021.</li><li>Offer runs until 19th November 2020.</li></ul><p><strong>2.</strong>‍<a href="https://www.hsbc.co.uk/current-accounts/products/advance/" target="_blank"><strong> HSBC Advance</strong></a><strong> </strong>- £125 bonus when you switch to HSBC + access to 2.75% Regular savings account.</p><p><strong>How it works</strong></p><ul role="list"><li>Open the account as a new customer.</li><li>Use the Current Account Switch Service within 30 days to complete a full switch with at least two direct debits or standing orders.</li><li>The bonus will be paid within 30 days of the switch completing.</li><li>You will need to pay in £1,750 or more each month (you can always close the account once you've received the bonus).</li></ul><p>‍</p><p><strong>3.</strong><a href="https://personal.rbs.co.uk/personal/current_accounts.html" target="_blank"><strong> RBS</strong></a><strong> </strong>- £100 bonus when you switch to RBS</p><p><strong>How it works</strong></p><ul role="list"><li>Pay in at least £1,500 by 30th December 2020.</li><li>Log in to your mobile app or online banking by 30th December 2020.</li><li>Receive your £100 bonus by 29th January 2021.</li><li>Offer runs until 19th November 2020.</li></ul><p>‍</p><p><strong>4. </strong><a href="https://www.lloydsbank.com/current-accounts/switch.html" target="_blank"><strong>Lloyds Bank</strong></a><strong> </strong>- £100 when you switch to Lloyds bank.</p><p><strong>How it works</strong></p><ul role="list"><li>Pay in at least £1,500 by 30th December 2020.</li><li>Log in to your mobile app or online banking by 30th December 2020.</li><li>Receive the £100 bonus ten working days after switching.</li><li>Offer runs until 9th November 2020.</li></ul><p>‍</p><p><strong>5. </strong><a href="https://www.metrobankonline.co.uk/about-us/press-releases/news/metro-bank-new-refer-a-friend/" target="_blank"><strong>Metro Bank</strong></a><strong> </strong>- If you are an existing Metro bank customer, you can refer a friend, and you'll both receive £50 after your friend successfully switches to Metro. The offer runs until 11th December 2020.</p><p>‍<br></p><h2><strong>9. Sell Old Stuff Online</strong></h2><blockquote>Selling your old stuff online is one of the best ways to make money quickly. It is also pretty straightforward and effortless to implement. You can sell anything from used clothes to old gadgets. You also can list your products as 'collection only' so you don't have to bother about delivery and delivery costs. However, if you want to appeal to a broader audience, remember to factor in delivery costs. Here are a few places where you can sell things online:</blockquote><ol role="list"><li>Facebook Marketplace</li><li>Instagram</li><li>eBay</li><li>Etsy</li><li>Amazon</li></ol><p>‍<br></p><h2><strong>10. Hobbies</strong></h2><blockquote>Identify your hobby and find a way to make money from it. Here are a few popular hobbies and my suggestions on how to make money from them:</blockquote><ol role="list"><li><strong>Drawing/Painting </strong>- sell your art online.</li><li><strong>Handyman </strong>- list your services online.</li><li><strong>Gardening</strong> - sell the house plants online.</li><li><strong>Photography</strong> - sell your photos using image hosting services like <a href="https://www.smugmug.com/" target="_blank">SmugMug</a>.</li><li><strong>Writing</strong> - start a blog.</li><li><strong>Cooking</strong> - start a youtube channel or an Instagram or TikTok account.</li></ol><p>‍</p><h2><strong>11. Employee Discounts</strong><br></h2><p>People often forget to take advantage of employee perks. Websites like <a href="https://www.perksatwork.com/" target="_blank">Perks At Work</a> and <a href="https://www.perkbox.com/uk" target="_blank">Perkbox</a> offer discounts on several retailers and brands. Employee perks are company-specific, so if you and your partner don't work in a company that offers them, you won't be able to benefit from them.&nbsp;</p><p>‍</p><p>Combining employee perks with cashback offers can be quite powerful and can significantly reduce your bills. It is also worth adding that even if it's just your partner who has access to these discounts, you can also benefit from them.</p><p>‍</p><h2><strong>12. Improve your Skills</strong></h2><p>If you've been made redundant, there's never been a better time to start improving your skills.</p><p>As you take advantage of some of the money-making ideas I listed above, try to dedicate some time each …</p></div></div></div></div>

       <p>Why can't we focus anymore? Why is it so difficult to focus on reading, studying, or thorough problem solving?</p>
       <p>Before we dive into the actionable part, here are some simple reasons why it's harder than ever to focus.</p>
       
       <h2>Why we can't focus</h2>
       <h4><strong>Reason #1: we process more information than ever.</strong></h4>
       <p>According to researchers from the University of California-San Diego, we consume through our phones, laptops, TVs and all other devices about&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://ijoc.org/index.php/ijoc/article/viewFile/1566/743">34 GB of information per day.</a></p>
       <p>The researchers say this leads to an information overload that hampers our focus and leads to constant interruptions that prevent us from reflection and deeper thinking.</p>
       
       
       <h4><strong>Reason #2: filtering out information takes effort.</strong></h4>
       <p>Contrary to common sense,&nbsp;<strong>ignoring things is not a passive mental process.</strong></p>
       <p>Researchers have found that&nbsp;<strong>it takes energy to ignore irrelevant stimuli.</strong></p>
       <p>In the Distracted Mind, neuroscientist Adam Gazzaley writes:</p>
       <blockquote><p>What we learned from this experiment was that the act of ignoring is not a passive process; rather, the goal to ignore something is an active one that is mediated by the top-down suppression of activity below baseline levels of passively viewing.</p>
       <p><a target="_blank" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15814009">(Source)</a></p>
       </blockquote>
       <p>It's not just about focusing better, but also about&nbsp;<em>ignoring better.</em></p>
       
       
       <h4><strong>Reason #3: we're being trained like mice by a variable-ratio reward schedule.</strong></h4>
       <p>Every like on social media, every notification, every email represents something&nbsp;<em>new!!!</em></p>
       <p><em>New</em>&nbsp;is exciting for us. Every such message releases the&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="http://sitn.hms.harvard.edu/flash/2018/dopamine-smartphones-battle-time/">neurotransmitter dopamine</a>&nbsp;in our heads, making us feel good and adventurous.</p>
       <p><em>What if my crush sent me a message?</em><br>
       <em>What if I got that job?</em><br>
       <em>What if a friend wants to meet up and hang?</em></p>
       <p>Unlike in the past, now we carry with us devices that enable us to check if the above is true in about 3 seconds.</p>
       <p>How are we then supposed to do work which may require serious mental effort when we have dopamine-candy within our reach almost 24/7?</p>
       
       <p><strong>We process more information than ever, so filtering out the noise takes a lot of effort, and we're constantly being led astray from focus by dopamine-loaded interruptions. No wonder we can't focus.</strong></p>
       
       <h2>How to improve focus</h2>
       <p>Given that ignoring is an active process, we'll suggest ways to both ignore noise better and focus on the signal better.</p>
       <h3>Strategic focus vs task focus</h3>
       <p>Before we go any further, we'll split focus into 2 types:</p>
       <ul>
       <li><strong>1. Strategic focus</strong><br>
       Answering the question: What to focus on?</li>
       <li><strong>2. Task focus</strong><br>
       Answering the question: How do I focus on work?</li>

       </ul>
       
       <h3>1. How to improve strategic focus</h3>
       <p>Let's start with the obvious.</p>
       
       <h4>Define what you want to focus on</h4>
       <p>It's hard to focus on something if you don't know what it is.</p>
       <p>If you're looking into a heavy fog, there's nothing to focus on. Same goes for mental fog.</p>
       <p>While it's becoming popular to say "systems &gt; goals" or even "no goals" at all, we are goal-driven by nature.</p>
       <p>On a neural level, we filter information through our goals. Our perception of reality is to a large extent driven by goals.</p>
       <p>As neuroscientist Adam Gazzaley writes in the Distracted Mind:</p>
       <blockquote><p>... the inward flow of information is sculpted and pruned by goals in much the same way that our actions are, resulting in our perceptions being an interpretation of reality and not a veridical representation.</p>
       </blockquote>
       <p>In other words, when you're looking for Waldo, your mind activates neural circuits to find someone in a red-striped shirt and ignores almost all else.</p>
       <p>Your goal determines your perception of reality. You're more likely to spot information relevant to your goal than all other information out there.</p>
       <p>If you have a clear goal, it will be that much easier to spot the right information to help you achieve it and ignore the noise.</p>
       <p>Which brings us to this question:<br>
       <strong>What do you want to do?</strong></p>
       <p>Make a list.</p>
       <p>Once you have some sort of a list, it's not yet time to pursue all the items on it.</p>
       <p>It's time to prioritize and refine.</p>
       
       <h4>Define what&nbsp;<em>not</em>&nbsp;to focus on - use Warren Buffett's goal setting method</h4>
       <p>Once you have any kind of a list of things you'd like to accomplish, it's not yet time to pursue goals. That would be unfocused.</p>
       <p>Here's Warren Buffett's advice on goals:</p>
       <ol>
       <li>Write down the top 25 goals that you want to achieve in life.</li>
       <li>Select the 5 that matter the most.</li>
       <li>Forget the rest.</li>

       </ol>
       <p>Buffett highlights that pursuing all 25 will distract you. It will lead to a haphazard, unfocused approach that likely won't lead to results.</p>
       <p>The general principle of picking fewer goals than you think you want can be applied every day. It's a safeguard against the tendency to pick too many goals and diffuse your efforts.</p>
       
       <h4>Find 2 Wildly Important Goals<br>(and put them where you'll see them)</h4>
       <p>In 4 Disciplines of Execution, the authors recommend finding 2 wildly important goals (WIGs).</p>
       <p>WIGs are goals that are so important that if you achieve them, everything else will likely work out.</p>
       <p>They also recommend putting your goals into a specific format:<br>
       <strong>X to Y by when.</strong></p>
       <p>If you were to define the 2 Wildly Important Goals to focus on, what would they be?</p>
       <ul>
       <li>Get to $10 000 in revenue by July 1.</li>
       <li>Write 50 000 words by August 31st.</li>
       <li>...</li>

       </ul>
       <p><strong>Define your goals to have a clear target to focus on.</strong></p>
       <p>However, that's not enough. You can write down the goals and forget them. Completely.</p>
       <p>You need to be hyper-aware of those goals, so that they stay on your mind even through the daily turmoil of life.</p>
       <p>How to do that?</p>
       <p>How to focus on goals that matter despite the noise? </p>
       
       <h4>Create an ambient visual reminder for WIGs</h4>
       <p>Once you have clear goals, you need to make them obvious to you every day.</p>
       <p>To do that, we recommend creating an ambient visual reminder.</p>
       <p>A post-it note written with a thick marker on your desk.<br>
       A big poster above your door.<br>
       A timeline on a whiteboard.</p>
       <p>Something in your&nbsp;<em>physical</em>&nbsp;(not digital) environment.</p>
       <p>The trouble with a digital environment is that if you have a goal written in a to-do app of some sort, once you close it it's out of sight out of mind. If you don't open the app in the morning, you don't get reminded of the goal.</p>
       <p><strong>Create a highly visual reminder for your goals and place it in your surroundings so that you see it every day. Every time you glance at it, it will remind you to focus.</strong></p>
       
       <h4>Strategic focus - summary</h4>
       <ol>
       <li><strong>Define what to focus on.</strong><br>
       Make a written list.</li>
       <li><strong>Select only the top-most items from that list - ideally 2 items.</strong><br>
       Decide to explicitly&nbsp;<em>not</em>&nbsp;focus on other, less important goals at the moment.</li>
       <li><strong>Phrase them in the following way: From X to Y by when.</strong></li>
       <li><strong>Place a visual reminder in your surroundings.</strong><br>
       Put it somewhere in your physical environment where it's impossible to miss.</li>

       </ol>
       <p>If you do this, you will become hyper-aware of when you're moving towards your most important goals, and when you're not. What you need to focus on will stay at the top of your mind, instead of being forgotten.</p>
       
       
       <h3>2. How to improve task focus</h3>
       <p>Once you know what to focus on, it's time to focus on it.</p>
       <p>As we mentioned before, ignoring irrelevant stimuli is not a passive process. It takes effort.</p>
       <p>It makes sense to divide improving concentration into 2 parts:</p>
       <ul>
       <li>Improve ignoring</li>
       <li>Improve concentration</li>

       </ul>
       <p>Let's get into it.</p>
       
       <h4>How to ignore better</h4>
       <p>To minimize the effort required to ignore irrelevant stimuli, either remove them if you can, or use something to make it easier to block out the noise.</p>
       <ul>
       <li><p><strong>Put on noise-canceling headphones.</strong><br>
       This is taking the&nbsp;<em>ignore the noise</em>&nbsp;literally. Background noises can disrupt our attention (especially true for people with ADD/ADHD). Whether it is your neighbors arguing or a&nbsp;<em>PING!</em>&nbsp;of a notification, if you can't hear them, you don't need to take the effort to filter them out.</p>
       </li>
       <li><p><strong>Find a quiet place to work.</strong><br>
       Sometimes even noise-canceling headphones aren't enough, in that case a public library or an empty class/conference room might do wonders. Even a different room can work.</p>
       </li>
       <li><p><strong>Declutter.</strong><br>
       Headphones will help with auditory clutter, but what about visual clutter?<br>
       If you have 50 post-its with ideas and to-do lists in sight, it'll take more effort to not glance at them. Remove them.<br>
       Same goes for 25 open browser tabs. Close them or go into fullscreen mode.</p>
       </li>
       <li><p><strong>Batch distracting activities.</strong><br>
       If you need to respond to emails or work requests as they come, learn to ignore them, if for but a moment.<br>
       Deal with emails once every 30 minutes, or once an hour, instead of checking it randomly whenever you get a tiny bit bored or stressed.<br>
       Minimize the number of switches between tasks.</p>
       </li>
       <li><p><strong>Minimize distractions before a work session.</strong></p>
       <p>The phone is a distraction machine. Sure, we can use it productively, but when it's sitting on our desks during work, it's a constant reminder that we could be doing something&nbsp;<em>fun</em>&nbsp;instead.<br>
       Here are our suggestions on minimizing digital distractions:</p>
       <ul>
       <li>Use the&nbsp;<strong>Rule of 3 Senses: hide your phone out of sight, reach, and hearing.</strong><br>
       Put your phone where you can't see, reach it, or hear it. A drawer or a backpack both work.</li>
       <li><strong>Block distracting sites on your computer.</strong><br>
       You can use&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://www.deprocrastination.co/home">our extension</a>&nbsp;or some other extension that performs the same function - blocking distracting sites in your browser. When you don't have the option of opening a new YouTube tab and going down a rabbit hole, you can focus better.</li>

       </ul>
       </li>

       </ul>
       
       <h4>How to concentrate better</h4>
       <p>Now that we have less to ignore, how to really hone in on work?</p>
       <ul>
       <li><p><strong>Go…</strong></p></li></ul></article></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>Tags: programming, elixir, supervisor, supervision tree</p></div><p data-v-d417aca0="">As developers, we always strive to offer our clients a high-quality service (or at least we should :) ). One of the most important features of high-quality service is its reliability. In other words, the service should rarely, if ever, be unavailable.</p><p data-v-d417aca0="">In the Elixir world, we can achieve this easily using a concept known as a supervision tree. Supervision tree is a structure of processes that allows us to build reliable, fault-tolerant and self-healing systems. This can make our application resistant to unexpected bugs that can creep up in the production. The kind of bugs that are really difficult to reproduce and that require specific state of the application to appear (google the term heisenbug). Supervision tree helps us in dealing with those kinds of bugs by simply restarting the part of the tree that's causing the problems. That way, we get to start off with a clean slate, and most of the times, that's enough to solve our issues.</p><p data-v-d417aca0="">So, how does Elixir make that possible?</p><p data-v-d417aca0="">First, let's take a look at how a supervision tree looks graphically.</p><p data-v-d417aca0=""><img src="https://kodius.com/images/blog/elixir-supervision-tree-complex.png" alt="complex tree" data-v-d417aca0=""></p><p data-v-d417aca0="">At its core, the supervision tree consists of two types of processes: workers and supervisors (imaginatively marked W and S, respectively).</p><p data-v-d417aca0="">Workers are simply processes which run some kind of logic. They are the meat of your application. Supervisors, on the other hand, are processes which supervise other processes, be it workers or other supervisors. This sounds like some kind of processeption, but at its base, it's not that complicated.</p><p data-v-d417aca0="">There are two main tasks a supervisor has: restarting its children processes in the desired way when they terminate (expectedly or unexpectedly), and terminating itself along with its children processes if it deems necessary, i.e. when there's something off with the state in its part of the application.</p><p data-v-d417aca0="">In simpler terms, workers run the domain code and if some error occurs and the worker crashes, or it finishes its work and “dies”, its supervisor restarts it. If crashing happens too often, the supervisor terminates the said process, along with the rest of its children and then terminates itself.</p><p data-v-d417aca0="">There are three available restart strategies:<br data-v-d417aca0="">- <code data-v-d417aca0="">:one_for_one</code> - the supervisor restarts just the process that terminated,<br data-v-d417aca0="">- <code data-v-d417aca0="">:one_for_all</code> - the supervisor restarts all of its children if any of its children processes terminates,<br data-v-d417aca0="">- <code data-v-d417aca0="">:rest_for_one</code> - the supervisor restarts the terminated process and the processes defined after the crashed one (I'll refer to this later, to make it more clear with an example).</p><p data-v-d417aca0="">If the restart strategy isn't enough to fix our application, self-termination kicks in. When we define a supervisor process, we can also define its restart tolerance, i.e. how many restarts of its children it will tolerate in certain amount of time before it decides to terminate itself and its children processes (default tolerance is total of 3 restarts in 5 seconds). That way we propagate process restart one level up, making the parent supervisor process restart our supervisor process, which, in turn, starts all of its children processes once again, and we're starting off with a clean slate.</p><p data-v-d417aca0="">Now, enough theory, let's put all this into practice!</p><h2 id="“simple-supervision-tree”" data-v-d417aca0="">Simple supervision tree</h2><p data-v-d417aca0="">Let's start off by making an extremely simple supervision tree, which will be made of one supervisor process and two of its children, which will be workers.</p><p data-v-d417aca0=""><img src="https://kodius.com/images/blog/elixir-supervision-tree-simple.png" alt="simple-tree" data-v-d417aca0=""></p><p data-v-d417aca0="">First, we'll define our supervisor process.</p><pre data-v-d417aca0=""><code data-v-d417aca0=""><span data-v-d417aca0=""><span data-v-d417aca0="">defmodule</span> <span data-v-d417aca0="">SimpleSupervisor</span></span> <span data-v-d417aca0="">do</span>

    <p>A few years ago I went to Spain for the first time, and like many I was surprised by <strong>how late is dinner</strong>. The first night I dined almost alone in a restaurant at 8pm, going away just as people were starting to come in. Of course this can be mostly explained by cultural reasons, but the clearly later-than-usual summer sunsets must also have played a role in shaping the Spanish days.</p>

    Solar time vs standard time

</figure>

<p>At the time I’m writing, near the winter solstice, Madrid’s sunset is around 17:55, <strong>more than an hour later</strong> than the sunset in, for example, Naples, which is at a similar latitude. The same difference holds at the summer solstice and around the year. Just because it applies to most places I’ve been, a time like that in Naples feels more natural to me, and probably to most non-Spanish people. But is it?</p>

<p>Looking for other regions of the world having the same peculiarity of Spain, I edited a <a href="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Standard_time_zones_of_the_world_(2012)_-_Pacific_Centered.svg">world map from Wikipedia</a> to show the difference between solar and standard time. It turns out, there are many places where <strong>the sun rises and sets late in the day</strong>, like in Spain, but not a lot where it is very early (highlighted in red and green in the map, respectively). Most of Russia is heavily red, but mostly in zones with very scarce population; the exception is St. Petersburg, with a discrepancy of two hours, but the effect on time is mitigated by the high latitude. The <strong>most extreme</strong> example of Spain-like time is western China: the difference reaches three hours against solar time. For example, today the sun rises there at 10:15 and sets at 19:45, and solar noon is at 15:01.</p>

<p>So, why do some countries are forced to have such discrepancies? The only way to assign to a place a <strong>canonical time</strong> which follows our main assumptions is to observe the instant in the day when the Sun is higher in the sky, and call that 12:00. This is <strong>not practical</strong> for at least two important reasons.</p>

<figure>
 <div>
  <p><a href="http://blog.poormansmath.net/images/analemma-sun.jpg">

  </a></p><figcaption>
    Analemma of the sun
  </figcaption>
 </div>
</figure>

<p>One is that (solar) <strong>days do not all have the same length</strong>: the modern calendar compensates by letting midday oscillate a bit around the year: for example, midday in Naples goes from 11:47 in early November to 12:17 in early February. The difference between solar noon and clock noon is beautifully explained by an analemma, a picture with an exposure taken every few days at clock noon, showing how the sun moves in the sky not only in height (the north-south) direction due to the different seasons, but also in the east-west direction due precisely to the different lengths of the solar days.</p>

<p>More importantly, <strong>each city at a slightly different longitude would have a slightly different time</strong>. It seems strange that time systems with such a huge problem had ever been practical, but in the pre-industrial-revolution world, travels were so uncommon and slow that this problem was no more than a minor annoyance. But in today’s hyper connected (physically and virtually) world, it is obviously not an option.</p>

<p>The transition from apparent solar time, where all days have different lengths, to solar mean time, where midday wanders around 12:00, was caused by the proliferation of <strong>mechanical clocks</strong> in the early 19th century. The change to a time zone system, to solve the second problem, was caused instead by the telegraph and even more by the spreading of <strong>railway networks</strong> in the second half of that century; it’s not a coincidence that the first country moving to a common time was Great Britain.</p>

<p>Indeed, if we acknowledge that the two problems must be solved, the natural result is the current <strong>time zone system</strong>. The immediate consequence is that in the western part of the time zone the sun rises and sets later than in the eastern part. Normally, these differences amount to at most half an hour in either direction, but <strong>human geography</strong> sometime forces greater differences. In Spain’s case, to allow Spain to have the same time as central Europe, the difference can exceed ninety minutes. China instead decided in 1949 to adopt a single time zone, and to place its center in the richer east, forcing the less populated west to have an uncomfortable time. Indeed, though not officially recognized by the government, people in Xinjiang (China’s west-most region) follow a time zone closer to their apparent solar time, shifted by two hours from Beijing time.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> luckily, the map was uploaded on Wikipedia as SVG, so it was simply edited with a text editor to add the gradients (using Inkscape to match the objects with their ids). I do not usually like cylindrical projections (my favourite is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robinson_projection">Robinson</a>’s, and yes, <a href="http://xkcd.com/977/">I like coffee</a>), but this time it made drawing gradients so much easier. And the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miller_cylindrical_projection">Miller</a> is a fair enough compromise.</p>

<h2><span id="What_is_intelligence.3F">What is intelligence?</span></h2>
<p>In humans, <b><a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Intelligence" title="Intelligence">intelligence</a></b> is a measure of the ability to <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/How_to_solve_any_problem%3F" title="How to solve any problem?">solve problems</a>.
</p>
<h2><span id="What_determines_intelligence.3F">What determines intelligence?</span></h2>
<p>Human intelligence depends on (1) innate qualities, (2) upbringing and (3) knowledge. 
</p><p><b>(1)</b> The <b>Genetic component</b> of intelligence is most apparent in the difference between humans and apes (see: <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Pleasure_of_communication" title="Pleasure of communication">Pleasure of communication</a>), however, it is far less prominent in a healthy human population. Some personality traits may have a greater impact on the ultimate intelligence than the actual innate brain processing power.
</p><p><b>(2)</b> <b>Upbringing</b> plays a crucial role in human intelligence. It should primarily be understood as the period when future intelligence can be undermined by disease, abuse, neglect and/or by limits on freedom. For healthy children, love and <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Optimization_of_behavioral_spaces_in_development" title="Optimization of behavioral spaces in development">free access to rich environments</a> is usually a sufficient condition for developing high intelligence.
</p><p><b>(3)</b> <b>Knowledge</b>: Given a basic genetic endowment and a healthy modern upbringing, most differences in adult human intelligence can be explained by learning and learning habits. There is also an important component of the interaction between the brain, the personality, and the environment. Some high-potential individuals get trapped in a set of <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Behavioral_system" title="Behavioral system">behavioral systems</a> that result in stagnation that may be hard to escape.
</p><p>Human intelligence has self-amplifying powers that may be undercut (1) internally by a pathology (or aging), or (2) externally by limits on freedom, esp. <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Free_learning" title="Free learning">freedom of learning</a> (e.g. <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Schooling" title="Schooling">schooling</a>).
</p>
<h2><span id="Universal_intelligence_is_elusive">Universal intelligence is elusive</span></h2>
<p>In healthy adults, intelligence is a domain-specific problem solving capacity. The concept of innate universal intelligence is a myth. A highly knowledgeable individual may show a spark of genius across many domains and come close to the sense of universal intelligence. We may use the term, a <b>Renaissance (wo)man</b> or a <b>polymath</b> in reference to such a person. Wide learning may provide an illusion of universal intelligence. This seemingly universal intelligence often runs in families. This may be explained by family culture, personality traits, and only to a minor degree by genes associated with the actual processing power of the brain.
</p><p>As much as there is no universal intelligence, there is no universal IQ test. All tests will depend on prior knowledge, interests, exposure, culture and other biases. Howard Gardner proposed the concept of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_multiple_intelligences">multiple intelligences</a>, where neurophysiological modalities may determine a preference for a specific type of cognitive processing. His thinking can be extended to all aspects of human knowledge where domain-specific training leads to the <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Emergence" title="Emergence">emergence</a> of domain-specific intelligence. In other words, there are as many intelligences as there are intelligent human brains. Correlations that lead to the concept of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G_factor_(psychometrics)"><i>g factor</i></a> are all rooted in cross-domain transfers (e.g. in a set of positive feedback loops, learning may affect sleep, circulation, neurogenesis, mood, etc.).
</p><p>As much as there is no universal problem solving capacity, there is no universal problem solving test (see: <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/PISA_fuels_the_education_arms_race" title="PISA fuels the education arms race">PISA refocuses on problem solving</a>). This extends to artificial intelligence. We cannot dismiss a state-of-the-art system on the grounds that <i>"all it can do is play Go"</i>. It is true that we still struggle to produce an artificially intelligent system that would show universal <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Learn_drive" title="Learn drive">learn drive</a> sufficient for the <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Emergence" title="Emergence">emergence</a> of highly applicable <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Abstract_knowledge" title="Abstract knowledge">abstract knowledge</a> when immersed in any domain. However, once we arrive there, we will still need to train the system in specific domains to call it truly intelligent.
</p>
<h2><span id="How_does_aging_affect_intelligence.3F">How does aging affect intelligence?</span></h2>
<p>In a healthy adult, domain-specific problem solving capacity will usually follow a curve in which there is an ascent in youth and a decline at older ages. The shape of that curve is determined by the balance of gains and losses. Gains are usually associated with learning, esp. learning via problem solving. Losses are mostly associated with health, esp. metal health, or neglect. As intelligence is a self-perpetuating quality, those who gain intelligence early may continue thriving into a very old age. On rare occasions, the effects of aging can be entirely compensated by lifelong learning, even in <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/How_fast_does_memory_decline_with_age%3F" title="How fast does memory decline with age?">octogenarians and beyond</a>.
</p>
<h2><span id="Intelligence_prescription">Intelligence prescription</span></h2>
<p>The above reasoning leads to a simple formula for high intelligence:
</p>
<p>To maximize intelligence, we should focus on maximizing the acquisition of <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Abstract_knowledge" title="Abstract knowledge">high-quality knowledge</a></p>
<p>The term <i>high quality</i> stands here primarily for <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Coherence" title="Coherence">coherence</a> and <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Applicability" title="Applicability">applicability</a> (see: <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Abstract_knowledge" title="Abstract knowledge">Abstract knowledge</a>).
</p><p>The above formula is universal and hermetic. It dispenses of the problem of the starting point, which will often differ vastly between individuals. It carries an important optimistic message that accelerates progress: <b>there are few innate obstacles to high intelligence</b>.
</p>
<h2><span id="How_can_we_make_populations_more_intelligent.3F">How can we make populations more intelligent?</span></h2>
<p>Immense progress could be achieved if adults could eliminate only two factors: (1) <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Stress_resilience" title="Stress resilience">stress</a> and (2) <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Science_of_sleep" title="Science of sleep">sleep</a> problems. As personality traits are set, escaping from toxic human environments may also play a role for a large proportion of the population. Millions of people fail to live up to their potential due to being suppressed by their work environment or even family. Work environments must be friendly and families must thrive on love. Without those preconditions, achieving high intelligence is difficult. The balance of gains and losses may be negative or insufficiently positive. In addition, for a large proportion of children, the chances for growth are stunted by <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Schooling" title="Schooling">schooling</a>. Schools often promote bad learning habits, loss of self-reliance and unhealthy social environments. One of the best predictors of future high intelligence is a well-established and intense <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Passion_and_memory" title="Passion and memory">childhood passion</a>.
</p><p>There is nothing wrong with striving at genius. See my <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Genius_checklist" title="Genius checklist">Genius checklist</a> for some hints. In short, if you are unhesitantly involved in passionate problem solving associated with perpetual learning, you can rest assured: you are on the ascending curve towards high intelligence. All you need to remember is to shelter your efforts from possible disruptions to this self-empowering status quo.

<h2><span id="Intelligence_vs._knowledge">Intelligence vs. knowledge</span></h2>
<p>Stable knowledge and new knowledge play key roles in intelligence. For details see: <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Knowledge_in_creative_problem_solving" title="Knowledge in creative problem solving">Knowledge in creative problem solving</a>.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>5:58 am</em><br><em>May 16, 2040 AD</em><br><em>State Correctional Institute Greene, Pennsylvania</em></p><p>It’s not every day, you are wrongly accused of murder and then sent to the best-facilitated prison in the country that hosts the most dangerous of the criminals. To think that others now thought I was a dangerous criminal as well was unsettling. The first person who died after I arrived at the ‘Correctional Institution’ was a 49-year-old Chinese-American named Li Wei. She had been there for 21 years for killing her teacher and would probably have been there for more but she had given up her right to appeal and had requested execution. After the initial shock had passed, I tried staying away from the other inmates. Forming attachments in a prison wasn’t a good idea. The way I saw it, they could be executed at any time.</p><p>“Count time. Turn the light on and stand at the door.” The loudspeakers came on as usual at 6 a.m. A few minutes later, breakfast trays were handed through the bars of the cell doors.</p><p>Today I was allowed in the unit’s law library. The two hours were never enough to gather enough information. Searching through the legal databases sitting in a cubicle using an old-fashioned computer from the year 2020 was enough to give anyone a headache and I was nowhere near prepared for my appeal hearings. When the two hours were up, I was led to my cell. What I wouldn’t do to get my old life back.</p><p>It was difficult to grasp how I had gone from being a bookworm holed in my apartment 24/7 to being accused of murdering a police officer. It would be years before I was proven innocent and another year before I was let out. To think I got here because of a glitch in the system’s face recognition system. They were willing to let a young innocent girl die rather than admit that there was something wrong with their technology. Having been here a month already and nowhere close to gathering enough information to prove my innocence, I had lost faith in God and the system. I had resigned myself to this cruel fate that God had handed me in a battered and dented platter.</p><p><em>Please let me find something to prove my innocence.</em></p><p>God must have heard my prayers because two days later members from the SCITECH arrived promptly at 11 in the afternoon.</p><p>Hearing the whispers from the others, I had already gathered that they were here to find volunteers to try out their newest technology because who better to try out your newest ‘technology’ on than the prisoners who had appealed for execution. Even if something went wrong, they would die anyway. If the technology worked, it’s all the better for them. We were nothing but <em>lab rats</em> to them. My lips curled in distaste. I wasn’t interested in being a lab rat. The technology wasn’t something you could rely on 100%. My current situation was a testament to that.</p><p>They were rounding the halls twisting their words to gather volunteers. I had lost interest in them and was playing chess by myself until they stood in front of my cell. There were three of them. The one in the middle seemed like he was the spokesperson. The other two were murmuring in the background.</p><p>“As you may have already gathered — ”</p><p>“Not interested.” I interrupted. He looked shocked as if a prisoner would dare to interrupt him while he was speaking. I couldn’t care less if he was offended.</p><p>“It could help you clear your name.”</p><p>I slowly turned my head to the side. It was one of the guys that had been murmuring in the background before. But his words caught my attention.</p><p>“Excuse me? Clear my name? Exactly what is it that you want to test?”</p><p>I should have known better than to meddle with technology after everything that happened. But proving my innocence by becoming a lab rat seemed like a sweet deal at the time. But I was wrong like I had been wrong about everything else in my life.</p><p>10 minutes.</p><p>That’s all the time I have. 10 minutes until I lose the remaining of my memories. Until I lose myself. Until I rid myself of this pain.</p><p>Until I die.</p><p>600 seconds.</p><p>599…598…597…</p><p>Memories were supposed to last forever. Even when the moment had long passed and the tears had long dried. Even when the jokes were long said and laughter had long faded. But fate had dealt me with a cruel hand. It had left me with a fragment of my soul.</p><p>555…554…553…</p><p>The technology was supposed to have worked. Instead, M-mry had backfired. The device itself was small and the process simple. Put on the small headset that came with a remote-like device. Type in the year and select what you wanted to backup. I had chosen high school because I didn’t have fond memories of that time. Instead of backing my memories up, it had deleted it from the main server. From my brain, it had stolen 4 years of my precious memories. Ones that I would never get back. Rafe had promised it would work but of course, he had lied. After he had seen the initial interest and curiosity in my eyes, he had used everything and said everything he could to get me to volunteer. And like a desperate idiot I was, I had believed every word he had said about how M-mry would free me by proving my innocence. I could remember every word he had said he was watching me with his chips blue eyes unwaveringly whenever he spoke.</p><p>“<em>The technology is new and it’s the prototype but we are sure that it works. Simply put, it’s a way to back up your memory. If it works, your ideas would not be lost even when you died. If you suddenly had Alzheimer’s disease, then you would still have a way to access your memories. Hypothetically, M-mry could prove your innocence by looking through your memories.</em>”</p><p>And when I had been unsure and close to backing out, he had used the one thing that was most important to me: My family.</p><p>“<em>M-mry is your only hope of proving your innocence. If it works, you will able to leave and see your family whenever you want. You could hug them and live freely. Be able to marry and have kids one day. Otherwise, who knows, maybe even in 20 years you will still not have proved your innocence.</em>”</p><p>That had been enough for me to sign my name on the thick document that protected SCITECH in case something did go wrong. And something went wrong indeed. Not only had I lost my memories of high school but now I had no way of getting them back.</p><p>480…479…478…</p><p>I didn’t think the memories I thought useless and unimportant when forgotten would feel as if I had lost a piece of my soul.</p><p>460…459…458…</p><p>Two weeks ago I gave up my right to appeal and asked for my execution. The new memories living in this prison would never replace the old memories and I was never going to get out of here even if I stayed here 40 years being on my best behavior.</p><p>355…354…353…</p><p>I never thought I would end up here.</p><p>250…249…248..</p><p>With the barest of memories.</p><p>110…109…108..</p><p>I thought that when I died, I would at least die as myself.</p><p>30…29…28…</p><p>I didn’t think I would die a shadow of my former self.</p><p>10…9…8…</p><p>I didn’t think I would die, a stranger.</p><p>3…</p><hr><p><em>Edited by <a href="https://instagram.com/cherrywine_stains" title="Mrk (cherrywine_stains) Instagram Profile" rel="nofollow">cherrywine_stains</a></em></p></div></div>]]>

October 24, 2020 | https://leportella.com/sqlalchemy-tutorial/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://leportella.com/sqlalchemy-tutorial/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <p><a href="https://leportella.com/sqlalchemy-tutorial/%7B%7Bbase%7D%7D/outreachy-I.html">I’ve been working with Project Jupyter since December of last year</a> and it has been a wonderful experience. The last couple of days I struggled with the SQLAlchemy library that <a href="https://github.com/jupyterhub/jupyterhub">JupyterHub</a> works on its internals. Since I studied this library and had to scratch some <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/">Stack Overflow</a> questions to find some answers, I created this post to help digesting some of my doubts and findings.</p>
<p>Since this post became surprisingly long, I decided that the main problem I was having with SQLAlchemy should be in a separated post. So, keep tuned :)</p>
<p>All code is available <a href="https://github.com/leportella/sqlalchemy-basics-post/">here</a>.</p>
<h2 id="creating-and-understanding-the-engine">Creating and understanding the Engine</h2>
<p>To start workin with SQLAlchemy, the first thing that they taught in the tutorials is to create an Engine. The Engine is how SQLAlchemy communicates with your database, so, when creating the Engine you should add your database (db) URL and that’s basically it.</p>
<p>Although we can access the db through Engine commands (we will see how), we usually don’t. You can, but you shouldn’t :)</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>from</span> sqlalchemy <span>import</span> create_engine

engine <span>=</span> create_engine(<span>'sqlite:///:memory:'</span>, echo<span>=</span>True)
</code></pre></div><p>So, you are just telling where your database currently is located. The attribute <code>echo=True</code> will make SQLAlchemy to log all SQL commands it is doing while you apply commands. This should not be activated in production, ok?</p>
<figure>
    <img src="https://i.imgur.com/0gVcCUg.png" width="200px"> 
</figure>

<p>Once your engine knows your database, it is easy to execute commands on it by using a method called <code>engine.execute(...)</code>. You can see how this is done here:</p>
<figure>
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/leportella/sqlalchemy-basics-post/master/gifs/engine_execute.gif" width="450px"> 
</figure>

<p>So you have a two way street: the Engine that knows where your db is and a method (<code>engine.execute(...)</code>) to change the db using the Engine:</p>
<figure>
    <img src="https://i.imgur.com/yjdhaTZ.png" width="200px"> 
</figure>

<h2 id="engine-or-connection">Engine or connection?</h2>
<p>I also saw in some tutorials that you have another way of doing SQL commands through the <code>engine</code> by making a <code>connection</code> such as:</p>
<pre><code>conn = engine.connect()
conn.execute(...)
</code></pre><p>This allows us to create transaction commands, which means that all commands must be done successfully or all should rollback in case of an error [<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/t-sql/language-elements/transactions-transact-sql?view=sql-server-2017">1</a>]:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python">trans <span>=</span> conn<span>.</span>begin()
conn<span>.</span>execute(<span>'INSERT INTO "EX1" (name) '</span>
             <span>'VALUES ("Hello")'</span>)
trans<span>.</span>commit()
</code></pre></div><p>So, actually, the structure looks more like this now:</p>
<figure>
    <img src="https://i.imgur.com/Bcp1Zku.png" width="200px"> 
</figure>

<p>However, looking more deeply <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/34364247/3538098">some answers</a> about the differences between <code>engine.execute(...)</code> and <code>connection.execute(...)</code> I found that they are not different at all:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Using Engine.execute() and Connection.execute() is (almost) one the same thing, in formal, Connection object gets created implicitly, and in later case we explicitly instantiate it.’’</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, feel free to use each one of those if you would like :)</p>
<h2 id="creating-and-understanding-sessions">Creating and understanding Sessions</h2>
<p>Until now we connected to our database and were able to execute commands through SQL statements. However, the thing that makes SQLAlchemy so attractive is its ORM, which was not discussed so far.</p>
<p>The ORM must have a <code>session</code> to make the middle-ground between the objects we will deal with in Python and the engine that actually communicates with the database. So, we need a function called <code>sessionmaker</code> that we’ll pass our engine to.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>from</span> sqlalchemy.orm <span>import</span> sessionmaker

Session <span>=</span> sessionmaker(bind<span>=</span>engine)
session <span>=</span> Session()
</code></pre></div><p>So, you will use sessions to talk to your tables and make queries, but is the <code>engine</code> that is actually implementing things on your db.</p>
<figure>
    <img src="https://i.imgur.com/iqV59ky.png" width="300px"> 
</figure>

<p>Although it seems confusing having three entities before even starting with our tables, most of the times after the initial setup you will use the <code>session</code> much more than the <code>engine</code> and <code>connection</code> will be done implicitly by the two firsts, ok?</p>
<h2 id="creating-tables">Creating tables</h2>
<p>Now we want to create tables in our db to work with them and finally start to take a look at SQLAlchemy’s ORM. To create new tables we will create classes that contain attributes. Each class will be a table in our db and each attribute will be a column in this table. To map which table in the db will be related to each class in our files, we will use a SQLAlchemy system called <em>Declarative</em>. To use this, the first thing we must do is to instantiate a <code>Base</code>:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>from</span> sqlalchemy.ext.declarative <span>import</span> declarative_base

Base <span>=</span> declarative_base()
</code></pre></div><p>Now we create a class <code>User</code> that inherits from our <code>Base</code> declarative. We will create only three attributes to our class: <code>id</code> (which is a primary key and can’t be null), a name and a password. Since we are using <em>Declaratives</em>, we must add at least two attributes: 1) a <code>__tablename__</code> that how your table will be actually called inside the db and 2) at least one Column which is part of a primary key [<a href="https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/latest/orm/tutorial.html#declare-a-mapping">2</a>].</p>
<p>We will also add an optional method called <code>__repr__</code> that will be a string that will be returned when we see our user instance.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>from</span> sqlalchemy <span>import</span> Column, Integer, String

<span>class</span> <span>User</span>(Base):
    __tablename__ <span>=</span> <span>'users'</span>

    id <span>=</span> Column(Integer, primary_key<span>=</span>True)
    name <span>=</span> Column(String)
    password <span>=</span> Column(String)

    <span>def</span> __repr__(self):
        <span>return</span> f<span>'User {self.name}'</span>
</code></pre></div><p>We now have a class that indicates us how our table must be on our database. However, nothing is changed so far. To actually create the tables on our database, we will need the declarative <code>Base</code> we just created and the <code>engine</code>:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python">Base<span>.</span>metadata<span>.</span>create_all(engine)
</code></pre></div><p>This is when SQLAlchemy will actually do something in our database. Since we have the variable <code>echo</code> set to <code>True</code>, we can see exactly which SQL statement the <code>engine</code> actually did on the database:</p>
<figure>
    <img src="https://i.imgur.com/kU4Snpb.png" width="400px"> 
</figure>

<h2 id="adding-new-records">Adding new records</h2>
<p>Now, we can use the class to create a new record on our database. We can user the <code>User</code> class to create a new user and <code>session.add(...)</code> to add the instance to our database.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python">user <span>=</span> User(name<span>=</span><span>'John Snow'</span>, password<span>=</span><span>'johnspassword'</span>)
session<span>.</span>add(user)

<span>print</span>(user<span>.</span>id)  <span># None</span>
</code></pre></div><p>Now, even though we said we needed a primary key, I didn’t pass one for the model. And if I try to print the id of the user I just created, it will return <code>None</code>.</p>
<p>This is because <code>session.add</code> just register the transactions we want it to do, but it doesn’t actually do it [<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/4202016/3538098">3</a>].</p>
<p>As explained on <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/4202016/3538098">this link</a>, we have two operations that can be done here:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>session.flush()</code> communicates a series of operations to the database (insert, update, delete). The database maintains them as pending operations in a transaction. The changes aren’t persisted permanently to disk, or visible to other transactions until the database receives a COMMIT for the current transaction (which is what <code>session.commit()</code> does).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>or</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>session.commit()</code> commits (persists) those changes to the database. <code>session.commit()</code> always calls for <code>session.flush()</code> as part of it.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="making-queries">Making queries</h2>
<p>Once we have our records on our database, we need to be able to find them :)</p>
<p>So, to the <code>query</code> function of our <code>session</code> we will pass the class we want to look for our instance, an then use the method to filter by an attribute called <code>filter_by</code>.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python">query <span>=</span> session<span>.</span>query(User)<span>.</span>filter_by(name<span>=</span><span>'John'</span>)
</code></pre></div><p>Finally, we pass a method to indicate what we want to do with this query: count the number of records found (<code>.count()</code>), return all records found (<code>.all()</code>), return the first record (<code>.first()</code>) and so on:</p>
<p>Another way is to use the <code>filter</code> method, instead of the <code>filter_by</code>, which has a slightly different syntax:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python">session<span>.</span>query(User)<span>.</span>filter(User<span>.</span>name<span>==</span><span>'John'</span>)<span>.</span>first()
</code></pre></div><p>With <code>filter</code> method, you can also look for strings similar to what you have:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python">session<span>.</span>query(User)<span>.</span>filter(User<span>.</span>name<span>.</span>like(<span>'%John%'</span>))<span>.</span>first()
</code></pre></div><p>On <a href="https://github.com/jupyterhub/jupyterhub">Jupyterhub</a> they added to each model a <em>classmethod</em> that would simplify this rather complicated syntax. We can add a method that you can pass a <code>session</code>, an attribute, and it returns all the elements, for instance:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>class</span> <span>User</span>(Base):
  <span>...</span>

  <span>@classmethod</span>
  <span>def</span> <span>find_by_name</span>(cls, session, name):
    <span>return</span> session<span>.</span>query(cls)<span>.</span>filter_by(name<span>=</span>name)<span>.</span>all()
</code></pre></div><p>So, the new way to find all users named only ‘John’:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python">Product<span>.</span>find_by_name(session, <span>'John'</span>)
</code></pre></div><h2 id="creating-new-tables-tables-after-initial-create_all">Creating new tables tables after initial create_all</h2>
<p>On problem I bump into while I was working with <a href="https://jupyter.org/">Project Jupyter</a> was that I needed to create a new table to a database and <code>engine</code> that already had a initial creation (the <code>Base.metadata.create_all(engine)</code>).</p>
<p>So, imagine that now I want a table with Products such as the following:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>from</span> sqlalchemy <span>import</span> Column, Integer, String

<span>class</span> <span>Product</span>(Base):
    __tablename__ <span>=</span> <span>'products'</span>

    id <span>=</span> Column(Integer, primary_key<span>=</span>True)
    name <span>=</span> Column(String)
</code></pre></div><p>The simplest way I found to do this was simply:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python">Product<span>.</span>__table__<span>.</span>create(engine)
</code></pre></div><h2 id="creating-a-foreign-key-relationship">Creating a Foreign Key relationship</h2>
<p>Imagine that you would like to connect each product to a user in your system. So, in each instance of <code>Product</code> you would like to store an instance of <code>User</code>:</p>
<figure>
    <img src="https://i.imgur.com/BJqWSMj.png" width="350px"> 
</figure>

<p>If you you are creating all tables now, you should add a Column on your <code>Product</code> class that references the Foreign Key of the user and a relationship with the <code>User</code> class:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>from</span> sqlalchemy <span>import</span> Column, ForeignKey, Integer, String
<span>from</span> sqlalchemy.orm <span>import</span> relationship

<span>class</span> <span>Product</span>(Base):
    __tablename__ <span>=</span> <span>'product'</span>

    id <span>=</span> Column(Integer, primary_key<span>=</span>True)
    name <span>=</span> Column(String)
    user_id <span>=</span> Column(Integer, ForeignKey(<span>'user.id'</span>))
    user <span>=</span> relationship(<span>'User'</span>)
</code></pre></div><p>And add a relationship between <code>User</code> and <code>Product</code> on <code>User</code> class:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>from</span> sqlalchemy <span>import</span> Column, Integer, String
<span>from</span> sqlalchemy.orm <span>import</span> relationship

<span>class</span> <span>User</span>(Base):
    __tablename__ <span>=</span> <span>'user'</span>  <span># if you use base it is obligatory</span>

    id <span>=</span> Column(Integer, primary_key<span>=</span>True)  <span># obligatory</span>
    name <span>=</span> Column(String)
    password <span>=</span> Column(String)
    products <span>=</span> relationship(Product, backref<span>=</span><span>"users"</span>)
</code></pre></div><p>Now you can create all tables by using the <code>Base.metada.create_all(engine)</code> we have seen previously.</p>
<p>Now, you can create a user and a product that are related with each other:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python">user <span>=</span> User(name<span>=</span><span>'John'</span>)
product <span>=</span> Product(name<span>=</span><span>'wolf'</span>, user<span>=</span>user)

session<span>.</span>add_all([user, product])
session<span>.</span>commit()
</code></pre></div><p>And that’s it :)</p>

		<p>No matter how famous or how ancient, all trees are ultimately owned by someone. It could be a government, a trust, or even just an individual caretaker. However, one white oak tree in Athens, Georgia was reportedly so beloved by its owner that upon his death, he gave the tree ownership of itself in his will.<span id="more-2706"></span></p>
<h2>The Legend of the Tree That Owns Itself</h2>
<p>The legend goes that a particularly large and beautiful white oak played a special role in the childhood of its owner, Colonel William Henry Jackson. When he died some time between 1820 and 1832, he deeded the tree and the soil around it to the tree itself. Here is the reported text of his will:</p>
<blockquote><p>I, W. H. Jackson, of the county of Clarke, of the one part, and the oak tree&nbsp;… of the county of Clarke, of the other part: Witnesseth, That the said W. H. Jackson for and in consideration of the great affection which he bears said tree, and his great desire to see it protected has conveyed, and by these presents do convey unto the said oak tree entire possession of itself and of all land within eight feet [2.4 m] of it on all sides.</p></blockquote>

<p>After that, the tree become known as the Tree that Owns Itself. However, there are a number of problems with the story’s validity. It originally ran as a front page story in the <em>Athens Banner Weekly</em> on August 12, 1890. That’s some 60 years after the supposed transaction took place, and there are no indications that anything special had happened to the tree before that (although it was known as Jackson’s Tree).</p>
<p>On top of that, the only witness to the will itself is the author of the article, and no one has been able to confirm that the statement above was ever made. However, the story became so popular that no one dared doubt the tree’s self-ownership. Effectively, the tree owned itself because everyone said it did.</p>
<p>Legally, of course, the tree isn’t able to own itself regardless of Jackson’s wishes. In fact, careful examination of property lines reveals that the tree isn’t even on his property. It’s officially part of the street (since it’s part of a median in the middle of the street), so its care falls to local authorities.</p>
<p>However, the tree is such a well respected landmark in the city that the Athens-Clarke County government has declared that in spite of the actual legality, the tree owns itself. Because they said so.</p>

<h2>Can a tree have rights?</h2>
<p>It might seem strange that a tree can own anything, let alone itself, but there is actually some legal precedent. Although they usually take a back seat to animal rights, plant rights have been discussed in several countries around the world.</p>
<p>In the Netherlands, a party called <a href="https://in.reuters.com/article/us-dutch-election-plants/plant-rights-party-to-contest-next-dutch-election-idINTRE62S2HA20100329">the Party for the Plants</a> was created to try to snag a few seats in the 2010 parliamentary elections. Although they weren’t particularly successful, their platform focused exclusively on promoting biodiversity and protecting plants from being harvested for biofuels.</p>
<p>More success has been found in New Zealand, where for the first time anywhere a forest was granted legal personhood and ownership of itself. The&nbsp;Te Urewera Act of 2014 changed the legal status of Te Urewera, a forest sacred to the Maori people, from a Natural Park into <a href="http://maorilawreview.co.nz/2014/10/tuhoe-crown-settlement-te-urewera-act-2014/">its own legal entity</a>.</p>

<p>Obviously the forest can’t speak for itself, so a board was set up “to act on behalf of, and in the name of, Te Urewera”. In March 2017 a second act was passed granting similar rights to the Whanganui River, since the local Maori tribe consider the river itself to be their ancestor.</p>
<p>Although it doesn’t go as far as giving trees and other plants ownership of themselves, the Clean Water Act of 1972 in the United States effectively grants them some rights. Under the ‘natural resource damage’ provisions of the law, trees and other resources have some basic rights. It’s the government, however, that’s entrusted with protecting those rights, although any money earned through litigation must be spent on the resource itself. Essentially, the money <em>belongs</em> to the resource.</p>
<h2>The Son of The Tree That Owns Itself</h2>
<p>The Tree That Owns Itself might have been granted semi-legal status in Athens-Clarke County, but that didn’t protect it from the whims of Mother Nature. It was heavily damaged in an ice storm in 1907, and eventually fell down in 1942. Many suspected that the tree had died long before falling.</p>
<p>But if the tree owned land, surely it must pass on to its next of kin. A tree grown from an acorn of the Tree That Owns Itself was selected as the heir, an transplanted into its new home in 1946. It also inherited the name, although it’s also referred to as the Son of the Tree That Owns Itself.</p>

<p>It’s now been more than 70 years since the tree moved in to the quiet residential neighborhood on Finley Street, and it appears to be doing well. Despite its unknown legal status, the legend lives on with a plaque commemorating the words that started it all. Slightly edited to be more intelligible to modern readers, it reads:</p>
<blockquote><p>For and in consideration of the great love I bear this tree and the and the great desire I have for its protection for all time, I convey entire possession of itself and all land within eight feed of the tree on all sides<br>
-William M Jackson</p></blockquote>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Last friday added another count to the yearly event we celebrate as “birthday”. I can barely remember my last birthday, I’m not a big birthday celebration person. I think every day can be a celebration if you choose it to be and a yearly event is not sufficient reason to treat yourself.<br></p><p>The passage of time seems to have changed over the years. Things move by at light speed, and if I blink I miss it. It doesn’t feel like a lot happened, and yet if I sit down and think about my last 1 year, a LOT has happened.</p><p>As I was reminiscing, I went beyond the last 1 year and thought generally of the value system that governs my life. These things come “obviously” to me and they’ve made my life better. I hope these values can serve you as well.</p><h3>1. Fixed vs Growth mindset</h3><p>If you’re anything like me from a few years ago, whenever someone would tell you a way to improve yourself or your life, your default reaction would be “yeah yeah but my life is hard I have X Y and Z reasons why I cannot do something about it”. </p><p>That’s fixed mindset. It’s when your mind operates under the base assumption that you, your situation, your surroundings, and your abilities, everything is static and fixed.</p><p>On the opposite end of the same spectrum is Growth mindset. Here, your mind knows and believes that everything is a work in progress, everything can be changed, and the path to changing something about your life that you don’t completely like is a path of fulfilment, not pain that you want to ignore.</p><p>A fixed mindset plateaus. A person with growth mindset improves and grows, a tiny bit, everyday and forever. </p><h3>2. Complaining drags you down, think problem-solutions instead</h3><p>I could complain about all the problems in my life, or I could list them down, write their probable cause, probable solutions, and the gaps in my knowledge that I need to fill with research to better understand the problem and find better solutions.</p><p>The energy that is used in complaining can be applied towards finding solutions. Not only do you not feel like shit, solving a problem is a positive experience and gives you the sense of control over your life vs submitting to “my life is so hard and the universe is out to get me”.</p><p>Sankalp was watching Mirzapur and shared this with me last night - </p><p><em>“I was watching Mirzapur today. There was a scene where the dons primary gun factory is burnt down to the ground by his rival. </em></p><p><em>He arrives at the scene, calmly guages the situation, then calls the CM who is one of his allies and tells him to release a press statement that the govt has tracked down a gun factory run by a criminal org, burnt it and put all the perpetrators in jail thereby making the state a safer place for everyone and uplift the party's image.”</em><br></p><h3>3. 0 or 1, choices are binary</h3><p>Most of the things in life are an either or. You either got up early today, or you didn’t. You either hit the gym, or you didn’t. </p><p>You could spend a lot of time in analysis of the gray area in between, but it’s a wasted effort on aspects of your life that operate like a transistor.It’s either 0 or 1, switched off or on.</p><p>Identify binary choices in your life and make them swiftly.<br></p><h3>4. Everything is on a spectrum</h3><p>At the same time, a lot of things in life are indeed in the gray area. These don’t have easy choices with clear outcomes, and yet you have to identify the spectrum and decide where you want to be on it in order to move ahead.</p><p>Hitting the gym is binary, how intensely you work out is on a spectrum.</p><p>Choosing to start a business is binary, how risky a path you pick lies on a spectrum.<br></p><h3>5. via negativa. Addition by subtraction</h3><p>The solution to most problems is not to add something, but to remove.</p><p>Not able to lose weight? You can exercise more, or you could eat less. You don’t need to add a night time meditation routine, you only need to remove your laptop and phone from the room.</p><p>A lot of pain in life can be prevented by “avoiding” doing things.<br></p><h3>6. Inversion, or how not to do</h3><p>Here’s a simple mental model that can make your life easier to navigate. Instead of looking for “how to be a good boss”, invert the question. </p><p>Identify instead the reasons that come up when you research “how to be a bad boss”. Apply via negativa, by avoiding the attributes of a bad boss you already become a good one. </p><p>I did the same when I had taken up my last PM job, by making a list of “how to be a bad product manager” and then avoiding those things. </p><p>Sankalp and I did the same when we were hiring by researching “mistakes to avoid when hiring”.<br></p><h3>7. Common sense is not common practice</h3><p>You might think something is obvious and also common sense, but I’ve learnt that there’s a reason many things are tagged as “common sense”. The phrase is an attribute that is desirable, but not necessarily literal. </p><p>Everyone knows eating greasy food in the long term will cause heart disease. Or not hitting the gym or exercising will make your body old and creaky and unfit. It’s common sense. But, not common practice.</p><p>The most important things in life are the simple and obvious ones. And yet they are the hardest to keep following day in and day out. <br></p><h3>8. Time and energy are finite resources</h3><p>The only finite resource in your life is time and energy. And every day, you have a finite amount available to you to apply to various things. Choose carefully.<br></p><h3>9. Velocity, not speed</h3><p>I refer to this over the more commonly referred hard work vs smart work analogy.</p><p>You could be running at a 100 miles/hour but getting no where if you’re moving in circles. Speed. </p><p>Your direction, where you are headed, is more important. Only by moving in the right direction do you make real progress. Velocity.<br></p><h3>10. Treat others the way you would want to be treated</h3><p>Another of the common sense not common practice terms. It’s easy to complain about others when they treat you unfairly. Yet when the power dynamics are reversed, people often do the same treatment to others.</p><p>The real test is how you treat others when you are in a position of power.<br></p><h3>11. People don’t know what they really want</h3><p>Nobody really does. The pursuit of meaning can end with the sharp knife of nihilism. There is no meaning or purpose in life.</p><p>But while having these thoughts are crucial to self-discovery, they aren’t helpful to fixate upon.</p><p>So people create meaning, direction, structures around their life to add meaning and purpose.</p><p>Which is why I think nobody really knows what they want. It’s all made up anyway.<br></p><h3>12. Your health can’t wait</h3><p>The truth is, every day our bodies are getting slightly older.</p><p>And after 25 things start moving faster. I bet they move even faster after 30 or later. Save yourself the trouble and maintain your body from before.</p><p>It makes it that much easier to get out of bed every day, have the energy to do all the things you want during the day, and just generally feel good.<br></p><h3>13. What you eat is what your body becomes</h3><p>The food you eat literally becomes molecules in your body.</p><p>One of the simplest ways to maintain health is by focusing on your eating.</p><p>It’s fascinating to me that we eat 3-6 times/day, and yet very few people spend any time or mental bandwidth understanding food, nutrition and its role in how it shapes our body.</p><p>There are simple heuristics that can go a long way - eating fats doesn’t make you fat, sugar is a carb that affects your body similar to how alcohol does, fasting has marvellous effects on your body, the mantra for weight loss is calories in calories out, the mantra for muscle gain is reps and protein intake.<br></p><h3>14. The information you consume is what your mind becomes</h3><p>If the food you eat becomes your body, then the information you consume becomes your mind. Protect your mind as if it’s your most precious resource (it is), by filtering the sources of information that you let influence you. Even your Twitter feed is programming your subconscious without you realising it.<br></p><h3>15. How you think governs everything in your life</h3><p>If you really think about it, how you think governs your whole life.</p><p>What you eat, whether you exercise, who you date, how you treat relationships, how you learn something new, how you deal with adversity, how you treat others when you are in a position of power, how you spend your free time, how you build your business.</p><p>Everything steps from the root of your thought process, how you think.</p><p>I spent an insane amount of time in 2017-18 deliberately trying to understand my thought patterns, why I think and do the way I do, how do I actually want to be, what should I change and what should I double down upon.</p><p>You can try to do this by reading books, but the best answers will come through developing high self-awareness and doing deep self-introspection.<br></p><h3>16. Generalist skillset is a Swiss knife</h3><p>Over the past few years, I’ve followed a simple mantra to learn whatever hard or soft skills can improve my skill tree required to build successful businesses.</p><p>I visualise it like the skill tree in an RPG game. You can’t unlock and master all branches, so you have to be selective in nurturing the right set of skills.</p><p>Thanks to this mindset, I learnt how to think about product, learnt how to design, simple coding but more importantly understanding the fundamentals of tech, and now I’m learning to become a great marketer.</p><p>This Swiss Army knife is what helps me understand and imagine better ways to achieve the goals we have set to build DelightChat.</p><p>And this doesn’t just apply to entrepreneurs.</p><p>If you’re a designer, you need to understand product management and technology to understand how design fits in between.</p><p>If you’re a marketer, you need to know how to write copy or design creatives or build landing pages in addition to coming up with a marketing strategy.<br></p><h3>17. The real meta-skill is the ability to learn</h3><p>And during this journey I realised that the actual ability isn’t being able to design, or manage product, or write great copy. The real meta-skill is the ability to learn new skills as they become important in your journey. <br></p><h3>18. Don’t chase people, become valuable instead</h3><p>Whenever a friend asks me “How do I make her like me?” or similar question, my answer …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A couple of weeks ago, me and my team made a pact that each of us will write something every weekend. What we write about depends on what influenced the individual during that week that was worth sharing with the world.<br></p><p>As it turns out, my job is to write software and most of my time during the week is spent on solving technical challenges. Sometimes I can write about these challenges and how I solved them, but sometimes I can’t because we are too early in our journey of building <a href="https://www.delightchat.io/" target="_blank">delightchat.io</a> to be able to make our core architecture decisions public. <br></p><p>So what do I write this week that will help folks reading it learn something? Here is a radical thought - what if I write about something that doesn’t have any lesson at all? Does good content always need a theme and an underlying concept that helps somebody do something better?<br></p><h3><strong>Seinfeld - a show about nothing</strong><br></h3><p>For those who are not familiar, Seinfeld was a very popular sitcom that aired from the early 90s to the late 90s and it is generally referred to as “a show about nothing”. <br></p><p>This is only a half truth because Seinfeld is actually a very well written show with intricate plots that seem random at first but tie up pretty smoothly towards the end of an episode. The real reason it is a show about nothing is because unlike other sitcoms, the episodes do not have a theme. &nbsp;There is no lesson that the characters learn and evolve as human beings, there is no hidden metaphor that teaches you morals and values of how to navigate life.<br></p><p>The show instead focuses on whimsical scenarios that the characters face as a result of being selfish and inconsiderate. The episodes involve characters getting into conflicts during their day to day interactions with friends and family and how they handle the conflict while learning absolutely nothing in the process.<br></p><h3><strong>Why I think this is important</strong><br></h3><p>Despite everything you just read about Seinfeld, this was one of the most if not the most wildly successful sitcoms of all time and every sitcom since Seinfeld tries to embody some aspect of this in their plots. If not in the main plot there are sub plots which are about people screwing up and learning nothing. And this is for the simple reason that the show was very entertaining.<br></p><p>Sometimes all we really need in life is a creative way to pass the time. We are not in a race to constantly better ourselves, become the post possible version of ourselves, learn new things and kill it in life every single day. Some days are just slow and unproductive. And these days matter because otherwise how do we value the days where we do kill it in life?<br></p><p>We are fed this notion that everyone needs to chase a goal in life and every single day must be an attempt to get one step closer to that goal. For the record, I do think we should all have something that drives us and fuels the machine that keeps us going in life, but this doesn’t mean that the machine can’t rest and do nothing once in a while. <br></p><h3><strong>Life is long</strong><br></h3><p>The phrase “life is short” is quite popular. It is meant teach folks that every day must be lived to the fullest because we are all going to die someday and the last thing we want is to miss out on anything worthwhile.<br></p><p>But if you think about it, unless everyone has a terminal disease or gets into an accident, the average life expectancy of a person is over 70 years. This seems like a long time to be able to live life to the fullest every single day! <br></p><p>Life is long enough to waste a few days on doing nothing and let the brain and the body cool off and blow some steam. Life is long enough to let a few days pass without learning something new or accomplishing something. Life is long enough to waste time reading this article even though it doesn’t teach you anything.<br></p><h3><strong>Why did I write this article?</strong><br></h3><p>If you are still reading this despite me telling you that you will learn nothing from this, it means that you were most likely just browsing the internet while looking for nothing in particular. And that’s why I wrote this article - to help you pass the time and remind you that it is completely okay to do so.<br></p><p>If by any chance you are reading this while sipping your morning coffee or having a meal, or in general while performing a pretty uneventful task, I hope I kept you engaged. This is what Seinfeld did for me.</p></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
          <div><p>Monero cryptographers <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2020/1126.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">recently discovered</a> how to conduct “atomic swaps” between Bitcoin and Monero. This means that any two people can swap Bitcoin for Monero between them without relying on any third-party service, using only software they run themselves.</p><p>As Monero is the god of privacy coins (and the blockchain <a href="https://icryptonode.com/products/monero-icryptonode-raspberry-pi-device" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">we develop products for</a>), this naturally led to speculation that this innovation would enable Monero to become a layer-2 privacy solution for bitcoin, which is itself <a href="https://www.chainalysis.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">notoriously traceable</a>.</p><p>Over the past week I have read all manner of incorrect information from uninformed commenters about if this is possible, how it will work, and what this means for Monero and Bitcoin.</p><p>Let me state clearly -</p></div>

<div><p>But it’s a Yes* (with an asterisk!). Let me explain:</p><p>Bitcoin is a public blockchain - the ledger is entirely open for analysis. This creates a perfect trail of transactions, allowing anyone to see the path of bitcoin from “freshly mined” to person A to B to C and so on. Bitcoin users who wish to maintain privacy have to do additional steps, such as using a mixing-wallet like <a href="https://www.wasabiwallet.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wasabi</a>. Using Wasabi is an imperfect solution, has fees, and requires a relatively large amount of money to use. Another option is to trust a third-party like a centralized exchange. Either way, “breaking the chain” of bitcoin transactions to establish privacy is difficult, expensive, usually involves trusted third-parties, and is not guaranteed to maintain privacy forever as Chainalysis and similar firms become more sophisticated at tracing bitcoin transactions.</p><p>Bitcoin / Monero atomic swaps will establish privacy in a fully decentralized way - one that doesn’t rely on mixing technology or third-party trusted services. The way it will work is thus:</p><p>Alice currently owns bitcoin, but because of blockchain-analysis it’s trivial to know she purchased it at Coinbase. Fearing for her safety from an abusive ex-boyfriend, Chad, who works for the government and has access to Chainalysis software, it’s absolutely essential that Alice hides her bitcoin. Once Alice’s bitcoin is unlinked from her ownership, no one can prove she owns it, thus maintaining her personal safety.</p><p>Alice must do two trades - first, she swaps her bitcoin for an equivalent amount of Monero using an atomic swap and a counterparty she found in a decentralized exchange. She trades 1 BTC for 10 XMR.</p><p>Next, Alice swaps her XMR back to BTC. The market moved against her slightly - she now trades 10 XMR for 0.99 BTC, plus a small amount for network fees. Alice ends up with 0.9895 BTC.</p><p>Now, Alice has bitcoin that cannot be traced to her identity - she “broke the chain” that linked the purchase to her own identity. Alice never had to speak to anyone or trust any third-party service for doing so. She did work with two counterparties (trades from BTC to XMR and then XMR to BTC), but had no knowledge of who they were and never spoke with them, relying on software to conduct the swap peer-to-peer. She could not be scammed - provided she agreed with the trade amounts, it was mathematically impossible for her to lose her money at any step of the way - that’s why this is “trustless”.</p><p>Now, Alice has bitcoin she can save or spend anonymously. If she ever has a reason to anonymize more bitcoin, she can use the same steps to convert unsafe bitcoin to safe bitcoin, using the Monero blockchain as a privacy layer. Her wealth is now safe from Chad, the government rapist.</p></div>
<h2>Risks of Bitcoin to Monero Atomic Swaps</h2>
<div><p>As mentioned previously, <strong>Alice cannot be scammed using atomic swaps</strong>. Mathematics will perfectly protect her from a counterparty that tries to steal her money.</p><p>The biggest risk to Alice comes from <em>time</em> - the longer she waits, the less likely blockchain analysis will be able to track her, but the more likely the price will move against her.</p><p>Why is waiting important? Just like with <a href="https://tornado.cash/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tornado.cash</a>, if Alice were to quickly swap into XMR and back out into BTC, there will likely be few or no swaps other than her’s. This would make it probabilistically quite likely that the second BTC output is Alice’s. Alice should wait for several other swaps to occur before she executes her swap back into BTC.</p><p>Another risk is in the size of outputs. If Alice swaps 9.347 BTC into XMR, then swaps 9.347 back out, it’s highly likely it’s her’s.</p><p>Therefore, Alice should 1) Wait a while holding XMR (hours or days), and 2) make several, staggered transactions back into BTC from XMR. The biggest danger here is the price of Monero moving against Bitcoin, but it will likely be worth it to maintain privacy.</p><p>I anticipate that services will be created that make anonymizing Bitcoin simple and safe using standard output amounts (0.1, 1.0, 10.0 BTC, etc.) similar to tornado.cash.</p><p>One final note - I assume that chain-analysis can determine which bitcoin outputs are used for Monero atomic swaps. Given that the Bitcoin script used for the 2-of-2 Bitcoin locks is extremely specific, I assume that all Bitcoin UTXOs used for Monero swaps will be tracked. If Monero researchers find a way to obfuscate all atomic swap transactions among normal transactions, privacy can be greatly increased. But given the amount of intense research this solution will inevitably attract, it is unlikely “hiding among the crowd” will be possible. This is also why waiting after a swap will be extremely important.</p></div>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Monero can indeed be used as a layer-2 privacy solution for Bitcoin. It is not perfect, and risks with timing and transaction size can compromise privacy. But Monero is currently the only trustless, fully-decentralized solution for enhancing privacy on Bitcoin and I anticipate that it will become extremely popular.

<![CDATA[Practices for Better Terraform Module]]>

October 24, 2020 | https://deeeet.com/posts/practices-for-better-terraform-module/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://deeeet.com/posts/practices-for-better-terraform-module/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
      <p>I’ve been working at the internal platform team at Mercari for 3 years. In that team, we’ve developed and provided the special Terraform module, which bootstraps required infrastructure and SaaS services for building one microservice, to internal developers (See more details on <a href="https://speakerdeck.com/b4b4r07/terraform-ops-for-microservices">Terraform Ops for Microservices</a>). Now, this module is used by more than 400 services (since we create both development and production environments, actually it’s 800) and we’ve released the module more than 30 versions.</p>
<p>This blog post introduces some of the practices we developed while working on that Terraform module. “Better”, in this context means, <em>from the module user’s point of view</em>, easier to use and easier to maintain for a long period of time. Since the practices are very high level, some of them can be applied not only for the internal Terraform module but also for the public one and other software development like <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/api-extension/custom-resources/">Kubernetes CRD</a> and so on…</p>

<p>When designing the Terraform module, the first and most important thing you need to aware of is the variable of the Terraform module is API. Once you define a variable in your module definition, it’s open to users and target to modification. This means it becomes an interface between users and your module. In this sense, you can think of it as API.</p>
<p>Since it’s API, what kind of variables you define decides the complexity and the usability of your module. But, fortunately, many practices have been developed for good API design in this industry. The followings are some of the practices from them and I think it’s important for Terraform module design.</p>
<h2 id="module-should-be-deep">Module should be deep</h2>
<p>The Terraform module is an abstraction of the collection of the raw Terraform resources. An abstraction, in general, is a simplified view of any entity, which omits unimportant details. We create a module to make it easier for your users to think about and manipulate complex resources.</p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1256183/96132088-eafb8400-0f34-11eb-90d1-3eebabfadf38.png" alt="Philosophy"></p>
<p>The best modules are those that provide powerful functionality yet have a simple interface. In the book, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07N1XLQ7D">A Philosophy of Software Design</a> calls this “Deep module” (The word “module” is used for different context and not about Terraform module but you can think of them same). You can see the visualized notion of this above. “Deep” means they have lots of functionality hidden behind a simple interface. On the other hand, “Shallow module” is one whose interface is relatively complex in comparison to the functionality that provides (does not hide much complexity).</p>
<p>The module’s interface represents the complexity of that module imposes to the user: the smaller and simpler the interface, the less complexity that it introduces. When designing your Terraform module, always think about the depth of it.</p>
<p>Be careful that once you open your interface and it’s used by users, you can not change or delete it easily.  And it may be used in an unexpected way (See <a href="https://www.hyrumslaw.com/">Hyrum’s Law</a>). So what variable to expose is really important.</p>
<p>You can more learn about interface design from e.g., <a href="https://increment.com/apis/consider-the-interface-api-redesign/">Consider the interface</a>.</p>
<h2 id="interface-should-be-intuitive">Interface should be intuitive</h2>
<p>The module interface = <code>variable</code> should be intuitive to use. What happens when changing the variable should be obvious and predictable to your users. Don’t surprise your users. For example, avoid using the <code>enable_x</code> variable for enabling features not related to x.</p>
<p>Using consistent naming and format in the same module is also important to make it intuitive. For example, if the module uses the <code>enable_x</code> variable for enabling feature “x”, then enabling “y” should be also done by the <code>enable_y</code> variable, not by <code>setup_y</code> or <code>use_y</code>.</p>
<h2 id="variable-should-have-smart-default">Variable should have smart default</h2>
<p>The module variable should have a smart default value which covers 80% of users. The smart value means the best value in a limited context. The module which can be used without any configuration is the best (It also related to the upgrading strategy below). You should design carefully what default value it should have.</p>
<p>But, at the same time, it should have configuration knobs for the power users. Normally, you have the power users who can not use the module like the 80% of normal users. For such users, you should prepare ways of changing the behavior of the module. This knob should be designed properly and avoid having a shallow interface.</p>

<p>Upgrading is one of the most critical tasks of long-developing software. But, at the same time, it’s also the most bothering task. This is also true for the Terraform module, especially which is for the general purpose and widely used… It’s been huge problem for our Terraform module, too.</p>
<p>Since normally new features are added to the latest version, if you want your users to use the feature, you need to ask them to upgrade it. To make it works, upgrading must be easy as possible and less cost to users.</p>
<p>To make upgrading easy, <em>keeping backward compatibility</em> is most important. In the case of the Terraform module, if there is no Terraform state diff when upgrading the module version, it keeps backward compatibility. If there is no state diff, users do not need to care about anything when upgrading. So the best upgrading is no Terraform state diff.</p>
<p>The following practices are the idea of achieving this and reducing the cost of upgrading.</p>
<h2 id="new-functionality-should-be-off-by-default">New functionality should be off by default</h2>
<p>If you want to introduce new functionality to your module, you should make the feature “off” by default. It should be explicitly “on” by the users who want to use it.</p>
<p>Sometimes, you want to enforce all your users to use some features by default. Even in that case, you should do it gradually. When introducing, it should be “off” by default. Then you should ask users to enable it explicitly. After the feature adaption rate is increased (you should monitor it), then you can make it “on” by default. With this, you can reduce the effect of upgrading.</p>
<h2 id="upgrading-should-be-automated">Upgrading should be automated</h2>
<p>In other words, prepare <a href="https://dependabot.com/">dependabot</a> for your module. Especially, if you update the module frequently, you must prepare it. Even if you ask your users to upgrade, normally they don’t work on because normally they have more important tasks to do. We struggled with this a lot. So, instead, create PRs for them.</p>
<p>Internally, not only we send PRs of new version upgrading, but also we have the mechanism to automatically merge the PR if there is no Terraform diff. With the combination of this and <em>keeping backward compatibility</em> practice, we can increase the rate of users who use the latest version of the module.</p>
<h2 id="state-diff-should-be-small-as-possible">State diff should be small as possible</h2>
<p>It’s not possible to make upgrading no state diff always. Sometimes you need to introduce breaking changes e.g., because of changes in dependent resources or security issues needed to be patched as soon as possible.  In that case, you must think about how to reduce the cost. If the state diff is less, then the cost of upgrading is less. The more you include diff, the fewer chances users upgrade it.</p>
<p>When introducing the breaking changes, you must tell it by the documentation. The documentation can be <a href="https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/">CHANGELOG</a> or your user guides. If the documentation clearly describes the changes or the actions users need to take, the cost of upgrading decreases. For example, if the documentation shows what kind of state diff is expected in the documentation, the users can upgrade it without fear.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="main" role="main"> <article role="article">  <p>What do I want the future to be like? What amazing inventions do I want to see, and help build in my lifetime? I realized this morning that I don’t know. I was shocked.</p> <p>I’ve been tinkering with technology since I was a child, and I’ve been investing in early-stage companies for the past five years. More than sixty bets on the future. I’m meant to have bold visions of a better world, theses I support, and capital that I allocate in a technologically optimistic way. I began investing in startups because I wanted to help shape the future. And while I still get excited talking to founders with bold ideas, I have none of my own.</p> <p>When I was a teen, growing up on a diet of Carl Sagan’s Cosmos and Alvin Toffler’s Futurism, I had plenty of big ideas: spaceflight, supersonic travel, mag-lev trains, geodesic domes, bio-nanotech for longevity, and social organization to provide maximum freedom for all. Cheesy, but optimistic.</p> <p>Now I am 29 and I have no big, optimistic ideas. I think of plenty of arbitrages and improvements in efficiency. And while I believe that better infrastructure enables more construction and innovation, closing an obscure pricing gap just isn’t like dreams of great adventure and exploration on the frontier of human experience and possibility.</p> <p>I spend much time thinking about solutions to existing problems – the incentive mismatch in mass media that is causing accelerating polarization, how to remedy the effects of climate change, and so on. But these are all <em>fixes</em>, reactions. It feels like I’m in the belly of the ship, frenetically plugging leaky holes, never even having the space of mind to think <em>where the ship should go</em>. Ostensibly, those decisions are made on the bridge of the ship, which, in October 2020, seems to be populated by well-intentioned individuals, but hamstrung in their ability to make good collective decisions.</p> <p>Recent years have shown me how difficult it is to make <em>any</em> meaningful public decision. Every debate is endlessly contentious, every subject has meaningful nuance, and every decision has exceedingly hard-to-predict second-order-effects. The world is much more complex than it was even twenty years ago, and the effects are paralyzing. This is clearly felt among policymakers, but I feel it even as a technologist: I understand that virtually all tools can be used – and more often than not, <em>will</em> be used – for both good and evil, and how hard the results are to predict over years in our dynamic world. I learned that technology can rarely solve fundamental social problems, and I’ve seen the public perception rollercoaster of “this technology/person/policy is good” to “this is evil” more times than I can count.</p> <p>This puts me in a real bind for having high-conviction views that aren’t microscopically focused. As an example, for the past few years I have struggled developing a long-term view on bitcoin. By network effect, I think it is clear that in the long term, we will have <em>either</em> fiat or crypto – either fully centralized or fully decentralized – not both. Which world do I want to live in? I’m not sure. On the one hand, it is clear that our existing US financial system is fragile with systemic risk, a playball exposed to potentially irresponsible governance. You might call its mechanics unfair to the masses, but you’d also need to point out that it has <em>actually worked</em> in creating prosperity over the past 110 years. (And, comparing the US to other countries, it has worked remarkably well!) I agree with need for overhaul of the system, but I’m not sure if it’s wise throw out the entire thing and open up the world’s largest power vacuum in the process. This rarely ends well. I cannot tell, with intellectual honesty, which avenue is best to pursue. I doubt that anyone does.</p> <p>Other arenas of big problems and changes yield similar dilemmas. Perhaps consequently, I have found myself not dreaming big anymore. I dream small, where the effects are predictable. On dreaming big, there is the paralysis of responsibility and effects, but there is also a level of cynicism that has come to me over the years, as big dreams turn out to be much more fraught and complicated as they move into reality. The nuance, complexity, difficulty, responsibility, and often <em>irreversibility</em> in effecting big changes has slowly removed the stars from my eyes as I look at technology. Maybe that’s a good thing as I come to appreciate the gravity of change.</p> <p>But at the same time, if we don’t take big, bold, bets, we’ll be forever stuck in the valleys of local optima. As Bezos says, the size of your risk-taking should increase with the size of your enterprise – at scale, we should be taking many daring gambles, all the time. But it doesn’t feel like that’s really happening. It feels like we spend lots of effort debating marginal nuance, sitting in the belly of the ship doing maintenance, rather than charting the course forward.</p> <p>It is difficult to be an optimist in 2020. I admire the few<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2">1</a></sup> that still have the courage to dream big and to remind ourselves that there <em>is</em> a future that could be amazing and that is worth fighting for.</p>  <hr>  <br> </article> </div></div>]]>

<p>While COVID-19 case counts continue to rise, the race for a vaccine is heating up, with several candidates looking very promising for FDA approval in the next few months.  </p>



<p>Now, more than ever, it’s important to learn about the science behind the COVID-19 vaccines and stay up-to-date with the most recent news in the race for a vaccine for the novel coronavirus.  Read on to learn more about several of the most promising vaccines and how they work.  </p>



<p>This page is a collaboration between Fancy Comma, LLC and Nidhi Parekh of <a href="http://www.thesharedmicroscope.com/">The Shared Microscope</a>.  For the most up-to-date vaccine news and updates, subscribe to <a href="https://thesharedmicroscope.com/covid-19/">The Shared Microscope’s COVID-19 vaccine newsletter</a>.</p>



<h2>Everything You Need to Know about the Most Promising COVID-19 Vaccines and How They Work</h2>



<p>The most promising COVID-19 vaccines under development are categorized into four vaccine types: <strong>messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccines</strong>, <strong>viral vector vaccines</strong>, <strong>protein subunit vaccines</strong>, and <strong>inactivated vaccines</strong>.</p>



<p>Keep reading to learn more about each vaccine subtype, as well as the most exciting vaccines under development for each subtype.</p>



<h2>1. COVID-19 mRNA Vaccines</h2>



<p>The mRNA vaccines under development for COVID-19 include the Moderna and Pfizer/BioNTech vaccines.  Both of these rely on genetic material called mRNA (short for messenger RNA) in order to stimulate the body’s cells to generate antibodies which can neutralize SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19 infection.</p>



<p>Nucleic acid vaccines, which refer to vaccines that contain either DNA or RNA, have never been used on the market, so COVID-19 presents a unique “<a href="https://cen.acs.org/pharmaceuticals/vaccines/coronavirus-help-mRNA-DNA-vaccines/98/i14">make or break moment</a>” for mRNA vaccines.  </p>



<p>Both the Moderna and Pfizer/BioNTech vaccines are comprised of mRNA enclosed in tiny nanoparticles.  This mRNA contains instructions for the body to create only the part of the SARS-CoV-2 virus that causes COVID-19 infection — not the entire virus.  The spike proteins are depicted in red in the (by now) iconic photo of the SARS-CoV-2 virus below:</p>

<p>The SARS-CoV-2 spike protein uses its spiky features to get into human cells, where it can instruct our cells to make more copies of itself.  This replication is what causes COVID-19 infection.  Without the spike protein, the virus cannot get into our cells.  So, mRNA vaccines work by giving our bodies the instructions to create the spike proteins.  The mRNA is read into our cells to produce the actual spike proteins — but just the spike proteins, not the virus itself.</p>

<p>The idea behind the mRNA COVID-19 vaccine is that it gives our bodies the genetic instructions to produce antibodies to the viral spike protein.  This “trains” our bodies to recognize and neutralize the spike proteins. The next time the novel coronavirus enters the body, the immune system will work quickly to neutralize it before it can cause a COVID-19 infection.</p>



<p>Let’s learn more about the two most promising COVID-19 mRNA vaccines below.</p>



<h3>Moderna’s mRNA Vaccine for COVID-19</h3>



<p>Moderna Therapeutics is a biotechnology company headquartered in Cambridge, MA, USA.  Their vaccine (mRNA-1273) has the shortest development time of all the vaccines in Operation Warp Speed, with a mere 42 days from mRNA sequence selection to clinical trials.  Moderna’s vaccine was also the first vaccine to begin clinical trials in the United States.  </p>

<h3>Pfizer/BioNTech mRNA Vaccine for COVID-19</h3>



<p>Though a latecomer to <a href="https://www.hhs.gov/coronavirus/explaining-operation-warp-speed/index.html">Operation Warp Speed</a>, the large-scale U.S. government-sponsored initiative to get a COVID-19 vaccine on the market, the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine clinical trial is currently the largest Phase 3 clinical trial.  This vaccine (called BNT1262b2) may also be one of the first to obtain FDA approval — the Pfizer CEO, Albert Bourla, has repeatedly <a href="https://www.biospace.com/article/pfizer-ceo-anticipates-eua-for-vaccine-in-late-november/">stated</a> that he is committed to bringing a vaccine to market by the end of 2020.</p>



<p>Like the Moderna vaccine, the Pfizer/BioNTech is an mRNA vaccine.  Learn more about <a href="https://fancycomma.wordpress.com/2020/09/20/pfizer-biontech-covid-19-vaccine/">how the Pfizer/BioNTech mRNA vaccine works</a>.</p>

<h2>2. Viral Vector Vaccines for COVID-19</h2>



<p>Viral vector vaccines are a “mashup” of the SARS-CoV-2 virus as well as another virus.  The second virus acts as a delivery vehicle for the virus into the body. The two most promising viral vector vaccines at this time are developed by Oxford/AstraZeneca and Johnson &amp; Johnson.</p>



<h3>Oxford/AstraZeneca Viral Vector Vaccine</h3>



<p>The technology for this vaccine was initially developed by the Jenner Lab at Oxford University and was not specifically designed for COVID-19.  However, shortly after the pandemic, the Oxford researchers shifted priorities to quickly develop a COVID-19 vaccine.  In this process, they also welcomed biotech giant AstraZeneca to the research program to assist with clinical testing and production.</p>



<p>This vaccine is a viral vector — a “mashup” of a small segment of the SARS-CoV-2 virus and a chimpanzee adenovirus.  The viral vector has been cut-and-pasted together in the laboratory.  It is not capable of making more copies of itself; its only purpose is to deliver the SARS-CoV-2 genetic material into our bodies so that our cells can produce the viral spike protein.  This way, our bodies develop immunity to the spike protein so that, when another SARS-CoV-2 virus comes around, we will be able to rapidly neutralize the virus by identifying and breaking down the spike proteins.  This is the mechanism by which the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine prevents the virus from entering our cells to make copies of itself and cause a COVID-19 infection. </p>

<h2>4. Inactivated Virus Vaccines</h2>



<p>Inactivated virus vaccines are made by using heat or chemicals to kill the virus.  Because inactivated vaccines do not contain live virus, they cannot cause disease.</p>

<p>They are the oldest type of vaccine, dating back to the late 18th century when the father of immunology, Edward Jenner, developed a vaccine made of inactivated smallpox which helped the world eradicate this very serious and devastating disease.</p>



<h3>Sinovac’s CoronaVac Inactivated Virus Vaccine for COVID-19</h3>



<p>While not part of Operation Warp Speed, Chinese biotech company Sinovac has developed the most successful inactivated virus vaccine currently in clinical trials.  The vaccine, called CoronaVac, contains a killed version of the SARS-CoV-2 virus.  When introduced into the body, this inactivated virus can facilitate antibody production without causing disease.</p>

        <h3>Fixing Camera Freezes on the Raspberry Pi PiCam Module</h3>
        
        
        </div>
      
      <p><img img="" src="https://diode.io/images/blog/pi/camera1.jpg" alt="Article Blog Image">
      </p>
      
    </div><div>
      <p>Keeping your Raspberry Pi Video project up and running 24/7 can be quite a task. With the <a href="https://diode.io/download">Diode Client</a> you have always access from everywhere and can easily share it’s video stream. In our previous Raspberry Pi post we focused on the <a href="https://diode.io/raspberry%20pi/running-forever-with-the-raspberry-pi-hardware-watchdog-20202/">built-in watchdog</a> to keep survive hardware errors. But what do you do if the video fails on you?</p>

<p>There are different tools you can use to capture pictures from your Raspberry Pi Cam versions 1 and 2. The most common are <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/raspbian/applications/camera.md">raspistill and raspivid</a>. In our demo deployments we’re using <em>raspivid</em> to stream the live video to a local port and expose that through <a href="https://pi-taipei.diode.link/">Diode to the public</a>.</p>

<p>The command we use is this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>raspivid <span>-awb</span> auto <span>-t</span> 0 <span>-w</span> 320 <span>-h</span> 180 <span>-fps</span> 12 <span>\</span>
    <span>-ae</span> 16,0x77 <span>-a</span> 12 <span>-a</span> <span>"%X %m/%d/%Y"</span> <span>-ifx</span> saturation <span>\</span>
    <span>-ex</span> auto  <span>-n</span> <span>-l</span> <span>-o</span> tcp://127.0.0.1:3030 <span>-pf</span> baseline
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><img src="https://diode.io/images/blog/pi/video1.jpg" alt="alt_text" title="Live stream"></p>

<p>But sometimes we found that the stream would stop and show error messages like this in the logs:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>@07/25/2020 21:14:20 [EROR] Failed to connect local: dial tcp [::1]:3030: connect: connection refused server=europe.testnet.diode.io:41046

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>And in the logs of <code>raspivid</code>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>mmal: Failed to write buffer data (228 from 325)- aborting
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>At the same time the camera would indicate with a red light that it’s still recording, but no more picture data is coming…</p>

<h2 id="videocore">VideoCore</h2>

<p>The Raspberry Pi distribution comes with both the <em>OS kernel</em> as well as a <em>VideoCore firmware</em> for it’s camera. This firmware is what can cause this problem.</p>

<p>Luckily it can easily be updated. In our cases we found that just ensuring that the most recent stable version is installed solved for us the red led of death.</p>

<p>And this is what you do on ther Raspberry:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>sudo apt-get update
sudo apt install --reinstall libraspberrypi0 libraspberrypi-{bin,dev,doc} raspberrypi-bootloader raspberrypi-kernel
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The reinstall option forces reinstallation of the packages which will in turn ensure that the VideoCore firmware is updated in the hardware.</p>

<p>If you got any troubles with your Pi or running Diode on the Pi feel free to reach out to us on <a href="https://t.me/diode_chain">Telegram and ask questions directly there.</a></p>

<p>And if you want to learn more about Diode be sure to check out the <a href="https://github.com/diodechain/wiki/wiki/FAQs">Diode FAQs</a>.</p>

<![CDATA[A simpler approach to bookmarks]]>

October 24, 2020 | https://www.samhh.com/blog/simpler-bookmarks/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.samhh.com/blog/simpler-bookmarks/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>We all use the web, and we all use bookmarks. But did you know that you don’t have to use the bookmarking functionality built into your web browser?</p>
<p>This is why a while ago I migrated to <a href="https://github.com/jarun/buku">buku</a> and, at the time still pretty much living inside my web browser, I wrote <a href="https://github.com/samhh/bukubrow-webext">Bukubrow</a>. (I’m really creative at naming things as you can see!)</p>
<p>Any external bookmark manager is a ton better than using that which is built into your browser for one key reason - you’re no longer tied to a specific browser. Sure, you might (?) be able to import and export those bookmarks around, but it’s a hassle and not something I’d want to rely upon as browser vendors struggle to find reasons to differentiate, leaving platform lock-in increasingly tempting. I’m certain at one point it wasn’t possible at all, but I assume and hope that in the many years since things have improved.</p>
<p>You want to know something really annoying about buku? It’s written in Python. This means that, as the interpreter starts up on each <code>buku</code> invocation on the command-line, there’s a perceptible delay that isn’t present on any piece of software written in C, Rust, Go, Haskell, et cetera. (The same problem plagues JavaScript to an even worse extent.) It’s a terrible user experience. When you’re used to your terminal opening in mere milliseconds, this delay is extremely annoying. (Side note: If you’re running something like <a href="https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty">Alacritty</a> and your prompt isn’t ready virtually immediately then you’re probably using something like Oh My Zsh!, which butchers the startup time of the prompt.)</p>
<p>Something else annoying about Python is the state of its package management. People rag on JavaScript projects’ complex and slow build systems, but at least once it’s distributed the end user typically has a single bundled script to run, just as with the other languages I’ve mentioned you’d generally have a single binary. Seemingly not so with Python! Installation of buku is painful because it carries with it a bunch of dependencies I don’t care about. These are implementation details for the author, and they probably shouldn’t be updated independently on my system. Can you imagine if all software was like this? You’d barely be able to go five minutes on Arch without some sort of dependency (of a dependency of a dependency) update requiring an update. <a href="https://beets.readthedocs.io/en/stable/">beets</a>, also written in Python, as much as I love it, suffers these same issues.</p>
<p>This led me to wonder what alternatives are out there. After being broadly unsatisfied with what I found, and having spent a while really enjoying <a href="https://www.passwordstore.org/">pass</a>, I decided to roll my own solution. What started out as a vague idea to write a “simple” bookmark manager in Haskell a la pass resulted in a truly simple shell script. Introducing <a href="https://github.com/samhh/dotfiles/blob/bcb15d05274478d78b4eecb7f56dd813f15a9dbe/home/scripts/flatmarks.sh">flatmarks</a>, a script so simple it doesn’t even warrant its own project page.</p>
<p>This script depends upon only a single tool, <a href="https://github.com/davatorium/rofi">rofi</a>, something a lot of folks running Linux with tiling window managers will already be using. It could be trivially updated to use <a href="https://tools.suckless.org/dmenu/">dmenu</a> or something else that can handle the interactive aspect. All it does is recursively collect the name of every file in a specified directory, present them to the user, and open the first line of the selected file in the browser. (Okay, technically it could open other stuff too as it’s calling <code>xdg-open</code>, but I’m not sure what else you’d put here. Maybe links to <a href="https://gemini.circumlunar.space/">Gemini</a>?)</p>
<p>The bookmarks directory itself can be thought of in the same way as pass’ password repo, except it’s lacking encryption. I suppose that could be quite easily implemented as well if you felt that necessary.</p>
<p>What does this look like in practice? I have a directory <code>~/.bookmarks/</code>, managed by git and backed up to a private remote somewhere, within which I have all my bookmarks. Most of them live at the root, but some are organised inside subdirectories. If ever I delete something and want it back, it’s right there in my git history. I don’t need to do anything at all if I change web browser. When I want to open a bookmark, regardless of where I am, I open <a href="https://github.com/samhh/dotfiles/blob/0f25b2e7cf4ca26482221347afac0034fee9f921/home/xmonad-samhh/Main.hs#L273">the keybind defined in my window manager</a>, which’ll open it up in my web browser of choice, currently <a href="https://github.com/fanglingsu/vimb">vimb</a>. When I want to add a bookmark I simply pop it into the repo and, if I want to keep it around for more than just a brief period of time, I commit it.</p>
<p>It’s a little more upfront work but the end result, in my eyes, is a lot simpler. It’s more ergonomic and it’s far less hostile to customisation and change. That seems to be the tradeoff with a lot of technology, Linux on the desktop as another example. The same can be said for a lot of the other software I’ve mentioned in this post too. But it’s totally worth it.</p>
<p>For anyone still using Bukubrow, this is why there hasn’t been much activity. It’s not abandoned, but I also don’t have much impetus to work on it as I did before as I no longer use it myself. You, too, might find a bash script and a git repo to be superior to anything more proprietary anyway.</p></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div>
<p>Update (2020-03-29)</p>
<p>When I originally wrote this blog post, my intent was to describe how things
worked on a typical system at the time.
Unfortunately, the operation of bash startup scripts is dependent on
patches added by OS distributions, compile-time options and if bash thinks
it was invoked by sshd or rshd.
I have no desire to add complexity to this post, so instead please
read this as a rough approximation of the truth.
If you want to know for certain how it works on your system, the only answer
is <em>test it yourself</em>.</p>
</div>
<p>If you’re a regular shell user, you’ve almost certainly got a
<tt>.bash_profile</tt> or <tt>.bashrc</tt> script in your home folder,
which usually contains various tweaks, such as setting environment variables
(adding that directory to <tt>$PATH</tt>), telling your shell to do clever things
(like <tt>set <span>-o</span> noclobber</tt>) and adding various aliases to commands
(like <tt>alias please=sudo</tt>).</p>
<p>(If you’re really organised, you’ll have all your dotfiles in a repository
somewhere so that you can keep your settings synchronised across all the
machines you work on.)</p>
<p>Anyhow, I suspect that few people know when things like <tt>.bash_profile</tt> and
<tt>.bashrc</tt> actually get executed. When I started, I just followed people’s
advice of putting stuff in <tt>.bashrc</tt>, and then when it didn’t work, into
<tt>.bash_profile</tt>.
I could stop here and describe just the bash startup process (as silly as it
is), but there’s a complication in that I switched to zsh a few years ago
(and haven’t looked back), but occasionally use bash on machines which don’t
have zsh installed.</p>
<p>In order to handle this nicely then, I need to be able to specify things which
are specific to bash or zsh in their own files, and then to specify things
which any POSIX-compliant shell (like aliases and environment variables) can
understand in a common startup file.</p>
<p>My solution to this problem is to define some new dotfile folders,
one for each shell (<tt>.bash/</tt>, <tt>.zsh/</tt> and <tt>.sh/</tt>), and one for the
shell-independent files (<tt>.shell/</tt>):</p>
<div><pre><span></span>.bash/
    env
    interactive
    login
    logout
.sh/
    env
    interactive
    login
.shell/
    env
    interactive
    login
    logout
.zsh/
    env
    interactive
    login
    logout
</pre></div>
<p>“But!”, you say, <a href="#since" id="id1">[1]</a> “what do the different files in here do?”
Ah, well I’m glad you asked.
There are two kinds of shells:</p>
<ul>
<li>[non-]interactive shells (you type into them / shell scripts)</li>
<li>[non-]login shells (the shell run when you first login / subshells)</li>
</ul>
<p>All shells will first run <tt>env</tt>, then login shells will run <tt>login</tt>,
then interactive shells will run <tt>interactive</tt>.
Once finished, login shells will run <tt>logout</tt>.</p>
<div id="where-to-put-stuff">
<h2>Where to put stuff</h2>
<p>It all depends on when it needs to be run.</p>
<p>If it’s setting / modifying environment variables, it should go in <tt>login</tt>.
If it’s alias or a terminal-specific environment variable (e.g., GREP_COLOR),
it should go in <tt>interactive</tt>.
In my <tt>.shell/env</tt> file, I have my umask set, and also define some useful
functions for modifying colon-separated path environment variables (like
$PATH).</p>
<p>Even if you don’t adopt anything else from my scheme, I’d recommend you take a
look at the what my functions are doing which differs from something like
<tt>export <span>PATH=$PATH:/path/to/dir</span></tt>.</p>
<p>That particular pattern is way too common, and is very dangerous if you
consider the case when <tt>$PATH</tt> (or whatever your variable is, like
<tt>$LD_LIBRARY_PATH</tt>) isn’t set.
Then, the value will be <tt>:/path/to/dir</tt>, which usually means both
<tt>/path/to/dir</tt> <em>and the current directory</em>, which is usually both unexpected
behaviour and a security concern.</p>
<p>With my implementation (see <tt>.shell/env_functions</tt>), you can append, prepend
and remove directories from any colon-separated environment variable, and when
appending or prepending, you are guaranteed that directory will only then
appear in that variable once.</p>
<p>As a side note, I’m very disappointed in my <tt>indirect_expand()</tt> function,
so if you have a better solution, please let me know (or send me a pull request).</p>
</div>
<div id="implementation">
<h2>Implementation</h2>
<p>In order to implement this, you first need an understanding of which startup
files are run in each case.
Of course, this isn’t hard, since all the shells have the same, sensible
system. Ahahaha, no.</p>
<p>Fortunately, I’ve read the man pages for you, and drawn a pretty diagram.
To read it, pick your shell, whether it's a login shell, whether it's
interactive, and follow the same colour through the diagram.
When the arrows split out to multiple files, it means that the shell will try
to read each one in turn (working left to right), and will use the first one it
can read.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://blog.flowblok.id.au/static/images/shell-startup.png"></p><p>An important point here is that if you have a non-login, non-interactive shell
running a plain POSIX shell (dash, bash in sh compatibility mode), it <em>won’t
fulfil</em> our contract in that it won’t read <tt>.sh/env</tt>
(and hence <tt>.shell/env</tt>).</p>
<p>The other special case which exists is Bash’s remote shell mode (which is
rather warped), where it tries to detect if it’s running under ssh or rsh (I
assume by looking at the process name of its parent), and if so, follows a
different path, which is indicated on the diagram.</p>
<p>Except that diagram shows what happens according to the man page, and not what
happens when you actually try it out in real life.
This second diagram more accurately captures the insanity of bash:</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://blog.flowblok.id.au/static/images/shell-startup-actual.png"></p><p>See how remote interactive login shells read /etc/bash.bashrc, but normal
interactive login shells don’t? Sigh.</p>
<p>Finally, <a href="http://hg.flowblok.id.au/shell-startup">here’s a repository</a> containing my implementation and the graphviz
files for the above diagram.
If your POSIX-compliant shell isn’t listed here, or if I’ve made a horrible
mistake (or just a tiny one), please send me a pull request or make a comment
below, and I’ll update this post accordingly.</p>

            <p>Since a few month I own an electrical toothbrush from Phillips called <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Sonicare+HX992B">Sonicare HX992B</a>. It connects to <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.philips.cdp.ohc.tuscany" title="App">an mobile App</a> using Bluetooth that tells you how well you brushed your teeth, shows the orientation in real-time, and also notifies you when to change the brush for a new one.</p>
            <p><img src="https://blog.johannes-mittendorfer.com/assets/img/sonicare-image.jpeg" alt="Phillips Sonicare"></p>
            <p>I was curious how this exactly works. Since the application uses Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), I used the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=no.nordicsemi.android.mcp">nRF Connect</a> app for Android to get a list of advertised services.</p>

            <p>Now I had a list of 12 BLE services of which only four are <a href="https://www.bluetooth.com/de/specifications/gatt/" title="List of common services">standard services described on bluetooth.com</a>. In addition to well-known services like Generic Access, Generic Attribute, Device Information and Battery Service, also eight custom services exist, that were created by the manufacturer. Every one of the first seven service UUIDs starts with <code>477ea600-a260-11e4-ae37-0002a5d5000</code> and ends with a number from 1 to 8 with number 3 missing. An additional eight service has a completely different prefix than the others.</p>

            <p>By switching the device on and off, changing the strength and mode and also by changing the brush back and forth, I was able to identify some of the characteristics of the six services. By reverse engineering the code of the Android app using <a href="https://github.com/skylot/jadx">jadx</a> I found information about the session storage and many other things.</p>

            <p>According to the application sources, the last unknown service is called “Moonshine Streaming” and is used to update the firmware. I agreed with myself to not touch this one, since I could damage the firmware and would need to brush my teeth by hand again.</p>
            <p>Since I could see a very course orientation displayed in the app during a cleaning session, I expected orientation data somewhere in the characteristics. I found them in the service <code>5</code>. Once you enable notifications for the <code>4130</code> service, you get a data stream to byte arrays. It turns out, these are indeed the values of the gyroscope.</p>

            <p>I created a python library to interface with the toothbrush in Python. Feel free to experiment, find the meaning of the missing services and submit pull requests: <a href="https://github.com/joushx/python-sonicare">https://github.com/joushx/python-sonicare</a></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>If you are an indie hacker or a solo founder, you probably realize that you have to wear many hats and simultaneously juggle many balls. Building and running a successful business requires you to be a developer, a marketer, customer support, and everything else that a business may need to survive.&nbsp;<br></p><p>But let me ask you a question. Of all those hats I mentioned, which one you wear the most? Well, if you have a technical background and know-how to code -like myself-, I bet it's the developer's hat. If you are aware of this and don't mind, simply because you enjoy coding and building a profitable business is not your highest priority, you probably don't need to read the rest of this article.<br></p><p>However, if profitability&nbsp;<strong>is</strong>&nbsp;your priority, but coding still takes +90% of your time, then maybe it's worth pausing for a minute to ask yourself, why? For me, that's the case. Coding takes a big chunk of my time. I enjoy coding, and I'm good at it. So it seems like spending my time coding is a "choice", at least, this is what I thought.<br></p><p>Last week, after <a href="https://www.jamalx31.com/sunday-tldr/themed-days">implementing themed days (newsletter email)</a>, I set a deadline for myself on Saturday to post on Reddit to promote my startup, Hatchy. I procrastinated on that for two weeks by then, so I promised myself that I would post no matter what, and I won't care if the product was ready.<br></p><p>Saturday came, and I kept my promise. I posted, and I received some excellent feedback, but also some critics. That's normal; what was interesting to me is the feeling I had every time I opened Reddit or IndieHackers to check the comments. I felt sick, stressed like I'm about to go naked on stage to deliver a speech. It's my fear of public embarrassment. That bit was kind of clear to me, but what it has to do with coding? I didn't make the connection straight away, but later on I&nbsp;read this:&nbsp;<br></p><blockquote>As Voltaire once wrote, "The best is the enemy of the good."<p>I refer to this as the difference between being in motion and taking action. The two ideas sound similar, but they're not the same. When you're in motion, you're planning and strategizing and learning. Those are all good things, but they don't produce a result.</p><p>Action, on the other hand, is the type of behavior that will deliver an outcome. If I outline twenty ideas for articles I want to write, that's motion. If I actually sit down and write an article, that's action. If I search for a better diet plan and read a few books on the topic, that's motion. If I actually eat a healthy meal, that's action.</p><p>Sometimes motion is useful, but it will never produce an outcome by itself. It doesn't matter how many times you go talk to the personal trainer, that motion will never get you in shape. Only the action of working out will get the result you're looking to achieve.</p><p>If motion doesn't lead to results, why do we do it? Sometimes we do it because we actually need to plan or learn more. But more often than not, we do it because motion allows us to feel like we're making progress without running the risk of failure. Most of us are experts at avoiding criticism. It doesn't feel good to fail or to be judged publicly, so we tend to avoid situations where that might happen.&nbsp;<strong>And that's the biggest reason why you slip into motion rather than taking action: you want to delay failure.</strong>" </p><p>- Atomic Habits, James Clear</p></blockquote><p>‍</p><p>It was the "aha!" moment. Coding is my motion. It's easy to be in motion and convince yourself that you're still making progress. You keep adding new features, fixing bugs, and re-styling your landing page, thinking to yourself how much progress you made. When I fact, you are just procrastinating on all the other important stuff.&nbsp;<br></p><p>In August, Chris McCormick shared a shocking post on IndieHackers.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.indiehackers.com/post/holy-heck-this-is-hard-8ebe864174" target="_blank">Only ~1% of 17,207 people who have joined Indie Hackers makes more than $2k MRR</a>. Of course, the data is not 100% accurate, but that doesn't discard that it's so hard and takes a long time for a solo founder to build a sustainable business. But maybe there is more to that than just the fact it's hard.<br></p><p>What if you are stuck on the "coding wheel"? What if it's taking so long not only because it takes time to build but also because you systematically slip into motion rather than taking action? What if you keep yourself busy coding to delay failure and, as a result, delay success?</p><p>‍</p></div></div>]]>

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>So, the adventure started in <a href="https://nicole.express/2020/personal-computer-engine.html">July</a> has come to an end. How did the project go? Where can I get the game?  Do I need a <a href="https://nicole.express/2020/super-grafx-cd.html">SuperGrafx CD</a> with dual <a href="https://nicole.express/2020/why-do-you-need-an-arcade-card.html">Arcade Cards</a> to play it? Will this give me a totally accurate understanding of quantum field theory? All your questions and more will be answered! Plus, stay tuned for a follow-up on coding for the PC Engine!</p>

<h2 id="its-here">It’s here!</h2>

<p><img src="https://nicole.express/assets/img/ava201/title.jpg" title="All images captured by Framemeister over RGB" alt="The title screen of Space Ava 201, a female figure looming ominously over a flat earth"></p>

<p>Like all of my games that I feel confident enough in to release there, <em>Space Ava 201</em> is now available on my <a href="https://nicole-express.itch.io/">itch.io</a> page, <a href="https://nicole-express.itch.io/space-ava-201">right here</a> to be precise. You can download it freely in CUE/ISO/WAV format, or throw some pennies at the author if you really want. (She even has a <a href="https://www.patreon.com/nicole_express">Patreon</a>! Okay, enough self-promotion)</p>

<p><img src="https://nicole.express/assets/img/ava201/level1.jpg" title="We're in space!" alt="An in-game screenshot of Space Ava 201, showing Ava on a space station"></p>

<p>Any TurboGrafx-16 or PC Engine emulator that can play Super CD-ROM<sup>2</sup> games can play <em>Space Ava 201</em>. You don’t need to configure things for the Arcade Card or the SuperGrafx; you can get a full gameplay experience with all levels, dialogue, and music still available without either of those. This goes for playing on hardware as well.</p>

<p><img src="https://nicole.express/assets/img/supergfx/spaceava-cover.png" title="Inspired by the Griffiths quantum mechanics textbook I used in college" alt="The cover of Space Ava 201, featuring a PC-SG logo"></p>

<h3 id="faq-and-more-screenshots">FAQ (and more screenshots!)</h3>

<h4 id="will-it-run-on-a-real-console">Will it run on a real console?</h4>

<p><img src="https://nicole.express/assets/img/ava201/dialogue.jpg" title="Space Academia" alt="A screenshot of Space Ava 201, wherein Cindy Palisade insists that because she's the captain, she gets to be first author"></p>

<p>I have personally tested this on my own PC Engine Duo R and SuperGrafx-CD setups using a burned CD-R, and found it worked successfully, if your console supports CD-Rs in general. (My Turbo Duo does not) I have also tested using the TerraOnion Super SD System 3 (an FPGA-based CD-ROM drive emulator) without issues.</p>

<p>I do not have any other systems to test on, but I see no reason they wouldn’t also work equally well. Of course, these systems being potentially over thirty years old, I can’t make any promises. Everything’s at your own risk, folks…</p>

<h4 id="how-does-it-handle-composites-video">How does it handle composite/S-Video?</h4>

<p><img src="https://nicole.express/assets/img/ava201/composite.jpg" title="A screenshot that is relevant to the question" alt="A screenshot of Space Ava 201, over composite video"></p>

<p>Recently, the retro community has been <em>rocked</em> by the revelation that the PC Engine/TurboGrafx’s video output palette is in some cases noticeably different between RGB output and composite video. Since most systems only offered composite outputs, this has raised a lot of questions over what the “correct” way to play games is.</p>

<p>To set the record straight for this game: I designed all graphics and tested using primarily the more vivid RGB colors. But if you do prefer the more muted composite or S-Video color palette, it’ll look good there too, I’ve run through the game that way to make sure. Play it any way you want! Even use one of those smoothing filters if you want.</p>

<h4 id="do-i-need-to-have-played-space-ava">Do I need to have played <em>Space Ava</em>?</h4>

<p><img src="https://nicole.express/assets/img/ava201/standoff.jpg" title="You Vs. Boo" alt="A screenshot of Space Ava 201, wherein Ava stands facing a villainous quantum goon"></p>

<p>Hopefully, no. This game is predominately about gameplay, and therefore the story is primarily comedic and intended to provide a break between segments. While many characters from the first game reappear, they’re not heavily characterized and it should be possible to enjoy the game fully without having played the first one.</p>

<p>That being said, you could <a href="https://nicole-express.itch.io/space-ava">just play the first one</a>. It’ll run in your web browser! And it has <em>isometric</em>.</p>

<h4 id="what-are-the-controls">What are the controls?</h4>

<p><img src="https://nicole.express/assets/img/ava201/antonia.jpg" title="Antonia knows the controls but won't tell you them" alt="A screenshot of Space Ava 201, wherein Ava is confronted by Antonia, a woman in a blue beret"></p>

<p><em>Space Ava 201</em> is predominately played with the directional pad. You’ll find no benefit from the Turbo Pad, Avenue Pad 6, Turbo Tap, or other specialty controllers, but you can use them if you want.</p>

<p>In <strong>standard gameplay</strong>:<br>D-PAD: Move Ava<br>RUN: Pause<br>SELECT: Kill Ava (restart level)</p>

<p>In <strong>dialogue screens</strong>:<br>Button I: Progress further in dialogue<br>RUN: Skip dialogue</p>

<p>In <strong>mirror puzzles</strong>:<br>D-PAD: Move cursor<br>Button I: Pick up and drop movable items<br>RUN: Attempt to solve puzzle</p>

<p>In <strong>side-scrolling segments</strong>:<br>D-PAD: Move Ava<br>Button I: Jump (can also use D-pad UP)<br>RUN: Pause</p>

<h4 id="how-long-does-the-game-take">How long does the game take?</h4>

<p><img src="https://nicole.express/assets/img/ava201/mazeoffice.jpg" title="The most powerful force in the Amalgamation of Worlds: Bureaucracy" alt="A screenshot of Space Ava 201, wherein Ava in an office building"></p>

<p>Playing through it myself, it takes a little under an hour to complete. Of course, I’m already aware of the solutions to puzzles, so I would recommend leaving a little more time than that, but overall it’s not a very long game.</p>

<h4 id="what-do-the-supergrafx-and-arcade-card-do">What do the SuperGrafx and Arcade Card do?</h4>

<p><img src="https://nicole.express/assets/img/ava201/supertitle.jpg" title="Super Ava vs. Capcom" alt="A screenshot of Space Ava 201 running with enhanced SuperGrafx features used to write SUPER behind the title"></p>

<p>The SuperGrafx is primarily used to provide additional graphical layers in some game modes. These are used to create more interesting backgrounds. Nevertheless, it is not required for any action. You can see more details about this on my prior article about the SuperGrafx-CD.</p>

<p><img src="https://nicole.express/assets/img/ava201/arcadetitle.jpg" title="Wow you added some text, aren't you cool" alt="A screenshot of Space Ava 201 running with the Arcade Card says 'Arcade' under the title"></p>

<p>The Arcade Card, if available, is used to preload all graphics at the start of the game for faster loading. However,  this is only faster if you’re doing a long play session that will actually use those graphics; should you decide you not want to sit through the preload, you can always press and hold RUN. Eventually, the images of the Arcade Card on-screen will change to Super System Cards, showing that you have skipped the pre-loading. The game will from then on run identically as if you hadn’t used the Arcade Card at all.</p>

<p><img src="https://nicole.express/assets/img/ava201/noarcade.jpg" title="Lily's so disappointed though" alt="A screenshot of Space Ava 201 showing Lily sad that you aren't using the arcade card"></p>

<p>All modes of the game, even the standard mode, will access the Backup RAM, if available, to save game progress. Only one game save is available.</p>

<h4 id="what-are-the-licenses">What are the licenses?</h4>

<p><img src="https://nicole.express/assets/img/ava201/neptune.jpg" title="This stage looks different if you have a SuperGrafx..." alt="A screenshot of Space Ava 201 showing a side-scrolling mode on a blue planet"></p>

<p>That being said, if you do take anything, let me know! My email is listed below, or you could just ping me on @nicole_express on Twitter.</p>

<h4 id="are-there-cheat-codes">Are there cheat codes?</h4>

<p><img src="https://nicole.express/assets/img/ava201/4cheats.jpg" title="How many times are we going to see this damn title screen" alt="A screenshot of Space Ava 201 showing more options on the title screen, because the cheat codes below were used"></p>

<p>Of course there are! Press these on the title screen:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Up-Down-Left-Right: Access story mode (allows progress through dialogue without gameplay getting in the way)</li>
  <li>Right-Down-Up-Right-Right-Down-Right-Right-Up-Up-Down-Down-Left-Right-Left-Right: Access the level select</li>
</ul>

<p>That last code is a <a href="https://www.nicovideo.jp/watch/sm21249768">reference</a> to something… might help you remember the code, if you speak Japanese anyway.</p>

<h4 id="are-you-going-to-make-a-physical-release-available">Are you going to make a physical release available?</h4>

<p><img src="https://nicole.express/assets/img/ava201/mirror.jpg" title="Boingy boingy" alt="A screenshot of Space Ava 201 showing mirror puzzle mode, which is aesthetically similar to Windows 95 for some reason"></p>

<p>I am definitely going to get some CDs pressed at some point. (If for no other reason, then to run it on my Turbo Duo!) However, I have little interest in selling copies myself due to the logistics involved; if there is demand I might reconsider this, since CDs generally need to be pressed in bulk anyway.</p>

<p><img src="https://nicole.express/assets/img/ava201/superneptune.jpg" title="See now this is what I'm talking about" alt="A screenshot of Space Ava 201 showing a sidescrolling mode, enhanced to have a scrolling background using the SuperGrafx"></p>

<h2 id="coding-for-the-pc-engine-part-2">Coding for the PC Engine, Part 2</h2>

<p>So back in July I wrote up a blog post on coding for the PC Engine; deliberately, I did this before I had written much code at all. So let’s see how that turned out!</p>

<h3 id="errata">Errata</h3>

<ul>
  <li>I claimed that the PC Engine used a shift register for the controller and is read serially (one-byte-at-a-time) like the NES controller. This isn’t accurate; the PC Engine can actually read four of the eight buttons at once.</li>
  <li>I claimed the Sprite Attribute Table doesn’t live in VRAM; this is and isn’t true: there is actually a portion of VRAM attributed to sprites, which is DMA’d into the internal SATB. So if you go trampling around all of VRAM, you will overwrite your sprites. It’s a pretty small region, though.</li>
</ul>

<p>Neither of these are huge errors, but they are worth pointing out.</p>

<h3 id="using-huc">Using HuC</h3>

<p>I was very impressed with the HuC compiler. I ended up being able to write pretty much everything in a performant fashion without too much issues; in the end, the only things I needed to reach outside of HuC for were to use block transfer instructions (and more on those later)</p>

<p>Of course, the fact that <em>Space Ava</em> is not in any sense of the word an action game probably helps.</p>

<p>There are some oddities which are definitely worth noting. For one thing, I couldn’t get the included <code>malloc</code> implementation to work, but in the end I don’t think it’s necessary. I found it fine to declare all blocks of memory you need for the overlay up-front; after all, the best garbage collection method is to just leave it all lying around.</p>

<p>Additionally, in standard programming, global variables are generally to be avoided, but in HuC they’re very useful to use– local variables are kept on a stack kept in RAM. The downside of this is that this isn’t the processor stack (as a 6502-based processor, the HuC6280 inherits its very limited 8-bit stack), so there’s a lot of overhead involved. Global variables are directly mapped to RAM addresses and are very fast.</p>

<p>As I also noted in my original article, I pretty much entirely ignored HuC/Magic Kit’s image processing methods and wrote my own. They’re very heavily tied to my <a href="https://github.com/nicolebranagan/terraformer">Terraformer</a> homebrew graphics editor which as far as I know no one else uses, but my routines are included in the source code if you’d like to take a look, written in Python 3.</p>

<p>Since these processing routines put all the images in a single “overlay” (you can think of an overlay as a file on the disk), it was trivial to add Arcade Card support by uploading the entire overlay into the card, and doing a quick check whenever VRAM would be loaded to bypass the CD-ROM drive if the Arcade Card was populated.</p>

<p><img src="https://nicole.express/assets/img/ava201/arcadeloader.jpg" title="I love using this retro mode" alt="A screenshot of Space Ava 201 showing data being loaded into the arcade card"></p>

<p>Let’s talk about those “overlays” more. An overlay seems to be basically a rough placeholder for a file system; there are “data” overlays which basically are just a pointer to a place on the CD, and “executable” overlays that are programs that are designed to be loaded into the Super System Card. This is all a HuC system, and there’s no reason to assume all PC Engine CD games work this way. In general, though, I found this made it pretty easy to break out multiple game modes into their own programs in a much cleaner way than, say, <a href="https://nicole.express/2019/making-of-aspect-star-n-coding.html"><em>Aspect Star “N”</em></a>, where even the title screen was just another mode of the game.</p>

<h3 id="the-block-transfer-instructions">The block transfer instructions</h3>

<p>In my initial blog post, I neglected them entirely. In my <a href="https://nicole.express/2020/supergrafx-cd.html">SuperGrafx-CD</a> blog post, I did block transfers using C! So what are these instructions?</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>tai</code> - Transfer Alternate Increment</li>
  <li><code>tia</code> - Transfer Increment Alternate</li>
  <li><code>tdd</code> - Transfer Decrement Decrement</li>
  <li><code>tii</code> - Transfer Increment Increment</li>
  <li><code>tin</code> - Transfer Increment None</li>
</ul>

<p>Sounds like a mess of alphabet soup, doesn’t it? I certainly thought so, which is why I just ignored them. But these are actually great for copying data back and forth. And what’s all this about Alternating? For example, let’s take this code sample from the SuperGrafx-CD article:</p>

<pre>sgx_load_vram(int vaddr, int *data, int nb)
{
    int i;

    poke(0x10, 0x00);   // Initialize VRAM address
    pokew(0x12, vaddr);
    poke(0x10, 0x02);   // Enter write mode

    for (i = 0; i &lt; (nb &gt;&gt; 1); i++)
    {</pre></div></article></div></div></div>

<p>You won't go to hell for these, but you should probably look at the manpage. Some programs are just limited, but hey, you can't expect every program to provide a printf function, a date formatter and handling of input from stdin.</p>

<h2 id="Undeclarative%20%3Ccode%3Egrep%3C/code%3E">Undeclarative <code>grep</code></h2>

<p><code>grep</code> is a true power tool in Unix, but can be abused. Here is an example (by me ðŸ˜®):</p>

<p><code>date --date="$(stat "$4/${i%\.html}.md" | grep Modify | cut -d':' -f2-</code></p>

<p>Poor old skuzzymiglet then had no idea about <code>stat --printf</code>, which has useful options for printing times:</p>

<pre><code>%w     time of file birth, human-readable; - if unknown
%W     time of file birth, seconds since Epoch; 0 if unknown
%x     time of last access, human-readable
%X     time of last access, seconds since Epoch
%y     time of last data modification, human-readable
%Y     time of last data modification, seconds since Epoch
%z     time of last status change, human-readable
%Z     time of last status change, seconds since Epoch
</code></pre>

<p>The human-readable dates are fixed-format, so you can just <code>date "your_cool_format" --date="@$(stat --printf="%Y" whatever_you_want)"</code></p>

<p>Generally, a <code>printf</code> like option is useful in programs - it discourages scraping and greatly shortens pipe sequences. But alas, most programs will need to be grepped.</p>

<h2 id="Functions">Functions</h2>

<p>It sounds weird but I believe functions are a shell code smell. The problem is that with a function, you expect paramater names (and types if you're a reasonable person ðŸ˜€). However, you'll find it's just like command-line arguments, and if you don't have the time to use <strong>getopt(1)</strong>, you'll be addressing by index.</p>

<p>Or you could just reassign to variables:</p>

<p><em>(from <a href="https://www.romanzolotarev.com/ssg.html">ssg5</a>)</em></p>

<pre><code>render_sitemap() {
    urls="$1"
    base_url="$2"
    date="$3"

    echo '&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt;'
    echo '&lt;urlset'
    echo 'xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"'
    echo 'xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.sitemaps.org/schemas/sitemap/0.9'
    echo 'http://www.sitemaps.org/schemas/sitemap/0.9/sitemap.xsd"'
    echo 'xmlns="http://www.sitemaps.org/schemas/sitemap/0.9"&gt;'
    echo "$urls" |
        sed -E 's#^(.*)$#&lt;url&gt;&lt;loc&gt;'"$base_url"'/\1&lt;/loc&gt;&lt;lastmod&gt;'"$date"'&lt;/lastmod&gt;&lt;priority&gt;1.0&lt;/priority&gt;&lt;/url&gt;#'
    echo '&lt;/urlset&gt;'
}
</code></pre>

<p>But who would use this?</p>

<pre><code>func render_sitemap(params []string)
</code></pre>

<p>I consider shell function with more than one parameter a contributor to write-only code.</p>

<h2 id="Multiple%20text%20processors">Multiple text processors</h2>

<p>The text processor hierarchy follows:</p>

<ul>
<li>single-purpose: <code>cut</code>, <code>tr</code>, <code>nl</code>, <code>sort</code>, <code>grep</code></li>
<li>flat: regexes and sed</li>
<li>text DSLs: Awk</li>
<li>scripting languages: Python, Perl</li>
</ul>

<p>Generally, you should use <strong>one</strong> and only one of those specified above. Start with the lower-down tool, then instead of adding a command to the pipe use a higher-tier text processor.</p>

<p>In pipes, programming languages get out of hand quickly. Putting everything in quotes and no syntax highlighting is difficult.</p>

<p><em>This list will probably get a few updates in the future. For now, happy scripting!</em></p>

                        </p><div>
        <address>Based on digital endocranial cast models the canine brain does not increase proportionally with body size. Researchers at ELTE Eötvös Loránd and Kaposvár University in Hungary reconstructed the surface morphology of 28 canine brains, including various dog breeds, wolves, coyotes, and jackals. The shortening of the facial skeleton greatly influences the ratio of certain brain regions, primarily the olfactory bulb and the frontal lobe. These changes might have profound implications for olfactory and problem-solving abilities.</address>

<p>Reconstructing the brain based on the internal surface patterns of a skull is a well-known method among archeologists studying the brains of extinct species, e.g.&nbsp; dinosaurs, mammoths and even cavemen. One way to achieve a model of the brain is to fill the endocranial space with specific gradually hardening fluids, and after the solidifying of the material the bones can be removed to reveal the cast, which reflects the surface of the brain with high fidelity. These are called endocranial casts, or endocasts.</p>

<p>Nowadays, rather than utilising endocasts, invasive process diagnostic imaging techniques are highly preferred. Computer tomography (CT) is the best and easiest way to visualize the bones, with all of their external and internal structures and composition. Using CT is also advantageous in endocranial analysis, as researchers can create virtual endocasts based on the digitized skulls. This allows for a higher freedom during examinations, because these virtual models can be rotated, colorized, cut, and completed. They can be shown not only on mobile phones, tablets or computers, but with the help of 3D-printing technology one can replicate them in the requested number and scale as well.</p>

<p>This digital endocasting technique was used by researchers from ELTE who scanned skulls from the collection of <strong>dr. Tibor Csörgő</strong> (ELTE, Department of Anatomy, Cell and Developmental Biology), which comprises almost 400 dog skulls from 152 canine breeds. “Due to the high resolution scanning, detailed 3D models could be created. This means that not only the main convolutions, that is, the cerebral gyri, can be recognized on the final model, but the location of the major blood vessels can also be seen on the surface.” - explains <strong>dr. Kálmán Czeibert,</strong> veterinarian and postdoctoral researcher at the Senior Family Dog Project, first author of the publication.</p>

<p>“We compared the shape, volume and surface features of the endocasts from 28 specimens in our recent study in <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fvets.2020.565315/full" target="_blank">Frontiers in Veterinary Science</a>. These models clearly show how the shortening of the facial part of the skull affected the morphology of the brain, distorting the olfactory bulb, which is pushed back and underneath the frontal lobe in certain breeds (like the French bulldog or pug), changing the ratio between the cerebral areas.”</p>

<p>In order to clarify how this change affects dogs’ olfactory and cognitive performance, further imaging and behavioral investigations are needed. The new collection is part of the <strong>Canine Brain and Tissue Bank</strong> at ELTE, funded by a European Research Council (ERC) grant. The bank will help researchers to link the brain with behaviour. “In some areas, where volume has diminished, neuronal density and the relationship with other brain regions may act to counteract these changes. To further examine these speculations, behavioural testing, diagnostic imaging (like CT, MR or EEG), and histological and molecular assessment will be needed.” - said dr. Enikő Kubinyi, senior researcher at ELTE, principal investigator of the research group.</p>

<p>“One of our primary aims was the widespread dissemination of scientific knowledge.’ - adds <strong>dr. Czeibert</strong>. “How dog skulls and brains vary is striking. For example, despite the 30-fold difference in body weight between a Neapolitan mastiff and a chihuahua, their endocasts’ volumes have only a 2-fold difference.” The researchers from ELTE plan to increase the number of skulls by digitizing more specimens for microevolutionary studies in the framework of an international cooperation.</p>

    <p>In my experience solving mathematical problems, I generally make the most progress when I am in a playful mood. 
Relaxed and focused, but focus that is effortless because the problem is so interesting. This brings to mind
a comment by Schmidhuber on laughter and the acquisition of new skills.</p>

<p>During one of his talks, he shares the observation that people generally laugh less frequently as they grow
older. His explanation for this is that humans generally learn less as they age. It is well known that 
neuroplasticity declines as we age, but I also wonder whether this is the whole story. There may be a cultural 
factor and it does appear that some cultures favor the appearance of seriousness more than others. And all 
cultures generally expect adults to look serious most of the time, whether or not this is actually useful.</p>

<p>While the cultural component may be difficult to analyse, I have generally observed that most technical individuals 
tend to become more serious as they are confronted with harder problems. Perhaps this is partly due to the
social expectation that they should look like they know what they are doing. But, this also means that they 
are more likely to revert to type and less likely to experiment. So the problem is more likely to go unsolved
and these individuals are less likely to learn anything new from their efforts.</p>

<p>I won’t pretend that I have an original solution to this problem, but this paradox reminds me of a Zen teaching:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In the beginner’s mind there are many possibilities, but in the expert’s there are few.-Shunryu Suzuki</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="root">
	    <div>
<h2>Prelude</h2>
<p>I read more often than ever that people are looking for ways to build
their own search engines.</p>
<p>Even if more on more "advanced" features are integrated into search
engines.  They are mostly based on human grunt work.  Semantic search
engine, whatever "semantic" does mean for you, is in fact merely a
couple, not more than a dozen, set of tricks.  I like to say, much of
Google's search engine is good old human labor.  If you still doubt
it, here is again: Google results are not only biased, also they are
editorialized.  Whether algorithms, and their bugs, party is
irrelevant.</p>
<p>My point is: it is human made.  Not some necessarly advanced alien
tool.</p>
<p>The only thing preventing you to have your own search engine is there
is no readily available software, why? because there is no cheap
hardware.</p>
<p>This might sound like a crazy idea five or ten years ago, but with the
advent of AMD threadripper ie. <a href="http://cultureandempire.com/html/cande.html">cost gravity at
play</a> getting together a
personal search engine is, if not a necessity, at least a possibility.</p>
<p>The most common complain I read about Google is that it yields
irrelevant text "that do no even contain my search terms". That is not
a bug, that is a feature!  It seems to me the subtext is that you can
not easily customize Google or whatever search algorithm since it is
privative.  Even retrieving Google search results for further
processing if not forbidden, is at least difficult.</p>
<h2>Getting started</h2>
<p>Let's start with the beginning: what is a search engine? A search
engine is software that will <strong>crawl</strong> the Internet, <strong>index</strong>
ie. store the text in a particular format, and that users can
<strong>query</strong> and receive in return the most relevant text.</p>
<p>Let's dive into what "relevant text" means. What is relevant text?</p>
<ol>
<li>A text that contains the search term in my query</li>
<li>A text that has the same topic as my query</li>
<li>A text that gives an answer to my query</li>
</ol>
<p>The good answer is "it depends".  That's why queries have grown from
keywords match like a book index, to boolean queries e.g. <code>"Apple"
-bible</code>, until so called semantic search, which boils down to consider
one-way or two-way synonyms and other lexical features.</p>
<p>So far, I failed to build a crawler that works.  Also much of the text
I am looking for is in wikipedia or StackOverflow for which they are
flat releases which are much more easy to get started than putting
together your own crawler.  Still, they are some crawler around, so
you can use that or learn from it.  I will not dive into the crawler
part because it still hurts when I think about <code>robots.txt</code>,
throttling, text encoding etc... booooh!</p>
<p>So, we will imagine that you have a dataset of plain text, for
instance wikipedia vital articles.  It helps if you know the content
of the dataset.  Querying random news article is not very easy to
grasp because you have to read (!) the text to figure when and how
they are relevant.</p>
<p>Before querying, you need to store the text, but to know <strong>how</strong> to
store the text you need to know which query feature you want. To get
started I will only consider positive keywords and negative keywords
like <code>apple -bible</code>. So, we need to figure which find out which text
contains the word <code>apple</code> but not the word <code>bible</code>. Looking up
everything that does not contain <code>bible</code> is difficult, you would need
to <strong>scan</strong> the whole database to what are those document. Instead we
will look for documents that contains the word <code>apple</code>.  So the
following document contains the word we are looking for:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>(</span><span>define </span><span>doc1</span> <span>"apple is looking for a search engine."</span><span>)</span>
</pre></div>
<p>That is the moment where the most advanced technology of our current
century makes it appearance: the inverted index.  <strong>What is an inverted
index? It reverses the relationship between the document and the word</strong>.
Instead of saying "this document contains the word apple" it says
"apple is contained in this document".  So we might have a procedure
that returns the document identifier that contains <code>apple</code>, like:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>(</span><span>assert</span> <span>(</span><span>contains?</span> <span>(</span><span>inverted-index-lookup</span> <span>"apple"</span><span>)</span> <span>1</span><span>))</span>
</pre></div>
<p><code>inverted-index-lookup</code> returns a list, and that list contains the identifier <code>1</code>
of the first document.  That list might be big. So <strong>you want to consider the least common word from the query</strong>. I call that step
<em>candidates selection</em>.  Also, you might want to convert the positive terms
into lemmas or stems to go toward semantic search, which will mean you need
to store lemmas or stems at index time.</p>
<p>Anyway, the next step, given the list of documents that contain the
least common word or term or lemma or stem, is to <strong>filter and score</strong>
according to the full query. In the above case, that is remove the
documents that contains <code>bible</code>.  You can do that step serially, and
it will necessarly take time.  The trick is to use <code>for-each-par-map</code>.
That is a cousin of map-reduce that execute the map procedure in
parallel.</p>
<p>For instance something like:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>(</span><span>let </span><span>((</span><span>hits</span> <span>'</span><span>()))</span>
  <span>(</span><span>for-each-par-map</span>
    <span>(</span><span>lambda </span><span>(</span><span>uid</span> <span>score</span><span>)</span> <span>(</span><span>when</span> <span>score</span> <span>(</span><span>set! </span><span>hits</span> <span>(</span><span>take</span> <span>10</span> <span>(</span><span>sort</span> <span>(</span><span>cons </span><span>(</span><span>cons </span><span>uid</span> <span>score</span><span>)</span> <span>hits</span><span>))))))</span>
    <span>score</span> <span>(</span><span>inverted-index-lookup</span> <span>"apple"</span><span>))</span>
  <span>hits</span><span>)</span>
</pre></div>
<p>The score function is interesting. I think going the
<a href="https://github.com/abusix/ahocorapy">aho-corasick</a> with a
<a href="https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/converting-boolean-logic-decision-trees-to-finite-state-machines-180ad195abf2">FSM</a>
is the best route because it is easy to implement proximity scoring,
"phrase matching", or really anything I can think of.</p>
<blockquote><p>⚠ That last paragraph is really the most important part of this
post.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>There is a gigantic leap that is going to happen in search because of
hardware availability, and free software with readable source ie. the
only thing that makes human progress possible: knowledge sharing.</p>
<h2>Malfunction! Need input!</h2>

<![CDATA[Understanding Virtual Environments]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
          <p><span>What is a python virtual environment ?</span></p>

<p><span>A Python virtual environments is an isolated environment for Python projects. This means that each project can have its own dependencies and let other projects have their own</span></p>

<p><span>It also means each project can have its own python version. For example, Project X could be using Python 2.7 and Project Y uses Python 3.6.</span></p>

<p><span>Creation of python environments is done using the <code>venv</code> module in python. The <code>venv</code> is an inbuilt Python module, no need for any&nbsp;installation if you have python already installed..</span></p>

<p><span>Virtual Environments are created for specific python projects. So to create one, you have to know the path to your project's main directory.</span></p>



<h3><span>Creating a Project directory or folder</span></h3>

<p><span>Run the following code in your command line or terminal:</span></p>

<pre><code>mkdir first_project &amp;&amp; cd first_project</code></pre>

<p><span>The mkdir <code>first_project</code> creates a directory or folder called <code>first_project</code> and the cd f<code>irst_project</code> navigates into the directory. <code>&amp;&amp;</code> just represents "and".</span></p>

<p><span>It is just the same as creating an empty folder and then opening it. Simple<img alt="smiley" src="http://127.0.0.1:8000/static/ckeditor/ckeditor/plugins/smiley/images/regular_smile.png" title="smiley"> </span></p>

<p><span>The directory <code>first_project</code> is the directory where all your project files are going to be. It is also the same directory where our virtual environment will be created</span></p>



<h3><span>Creating the virtual environment</span></h3>

<p><span>To create a virtual environment,&nbsp; run the <code>venv</code> module as a script. Note : You should be navigated into your project directory in the command line before running this:</span></p>

<pre><code>python -m venv firstproject-env</code></pre>

<p><span><code>firstproject-env</code> is the name given to the virtual environment being created, you could call it whatever you want. python tells the virtual environment to be created with Python version available. </span></p>

<p><span>If you have multiple versions of Python on your system, you can select a specific Python version by running <code>python3</code> or whichever version you want like this:</span></p>

<pre><code>python3 -m venv firstproject-env</code></pre>

<p>.<span>The first one is required when you have only one python version installed</span></p>

<p><span>So running the command will create the <code>firstproject-env</code> directory if it doesn’t exist, and also create directories inside it containing a copy of the Python interpreter, the standard library, and various supporting files.</span></p>



<h3><span>Activating virtual environment</span></h3>

<p><span>Once you’ve created a virtual environment, you may activate it.</span></p>

<p><span>On windows : </span></p>

<pre><code>cd firstproject-env/Scripts</code></pre>

<p><span>Then </span></p>

<pre><code>activate.bat</code></pre>



<p><span>On Mac OS</span></p>

<pre><code>source tutorial-env/bin/activate</code></pre>



<p><span>Activating the virtual environment will change your shell’s prompt to show what virtual environment you’re using.</span></p>

<p><span>On windows it looks something like this:</span></p>

<pre><code>(firstproject-env) C:\Users\USER\Desktop\first_project\firstproject-env\Scripts&gt;</code></pre>



<p><span>Thats it. You can then install, upgrade, and remove packages using&nbsp; <strong>pip. </strong>The packages installed will be isolated for only for a given project.</span></p>



<p><span>You should not worry about virtual environments if you are using an IDE like PyCharm. It automatically creates a virtual environment whenever you create a new python project.</span></p>

<p>A small list of methods for fast file system navigation from the command line.
While I tried all of them and finally settled on a minimal approach described at the end, the article doesn’t advocate for one method over the others.
Different users have different needs and should choose the approach most suitable in their circumstances.</p>

<h2 id="spring">Spring</h2>

<p>At the beginning, just after learning to use the command line, my terminal navigation included a lot of <code>cd</code> and a lot of <code>ls</code>.
I jumped around folders, learned shortcuts like, <code>cd ~</code>, <code>cd -</code>, and started becoming familiar with the shell.
Having multi-argument commands for quick file manipulation felt powerful and fresh, or so I remember.</p>

<p>After going to command line you no longer have to open folders in a graphical window manager, scan their names, use <code>&lt;ctrl + mouse click&gt;</code> to select them, and then drag the mouse to move those selected folders to another place.
You do <code>'mv pattern* place/'</code> instead.
All is nice.</p>

<p>But there was one problem.</p>

<h2 id="summer">Summer</h2>

<p>Along the way I started organizing my folders using a structure like this:</p>

<pre><code>└── work
    ├── bitbucket
    │   └── user1
    │       ├── repo1
    │       └── repo2
    ├── github
    │   ├── user1
    │   │   ├── repo1
    │   │   └── repo2
    │   ├── user2
    │   │   ├── repo1
    │   │   └── repo2
    │   ├── user3
    │   │   ├── repo1
    │   │   ├── repo2
    │   │   ├── repo3
    │   │   └── repo4
    │   └── user4
    │       └── repo1
    ├── teaching
    │   ├── class1
    │   │   ├── lecture1
    │   │   └── lecture2
    │   └── class2
    │       ├── lecture1
    │       └── lecture2
    ├─── clients
    │   ├── client1

    │   │   ├── project2
    │   │   └── project3
    │   ├── client2
    │   │   ├── project1
    │   │   ├── project2
    │   │   └── project3
    │   └── client3
    │      └── project1
    └─── ...
</code></pre>

<p>I often had to go in and out of various project folders and my <code>cd</code> + <code>ls</code> navigation became tedious.
Reaching a project involved navigating a big tree of directories.
On top of that a lot of directories had similar names which got in the way of tab completion.
This is where I found “z” - a command line utility that tracks your most visited folders based on frequency and recency<a href="#fn:1" id="fnref:1" title="see footnote"><sup>○</sup></a>.</p>

<p>“z” keeps a database of your most frequently used folders and allows to quickly jump to these folders even if you don’t remember their full name.
Instead of doing a lot of <code>cd</code> + <code>&lt;tab&gt;</code> all you have to do is type <code>'z proj'</code> and <code>z</code> will take you to your most frequently/recently accessed folder that has <code>proj</code> somewhere in its name.
It takes a short amount of time for “z” to learn about your most visited places but after that it becomes quick and convenient.</p>

<p>But there was one problem.</p>

<h2 id="autumn">Autumn</h2>

<p>“z” didn’t always take me where I wanted to be.
It worked, I would say, around 95% of the time or more.
But those other times it took me to an unrelated directory and distracted from the work at hand forcing to navigate my way back using the old <code>cd</code>.
Moreover, sometimes I moved and renamed various folders which likely contributed to its disorientation.</p>

<p>After this experience I decided that the terminal should be dumb and deterministic without any fuzziness or smart guessing.
And here I found <code>marks</code> - a short and sweet command line script for keeping manual directory bookmarks.<a href="#fn:2" id="fnref:2" title="see footnote"><sup>○</sup></a>
It consisted of 4 tiny functions: one for creating a mark, one for removing, one for listing all the marks, and one for jumping to the bookmarked folder:</p>

<pre><code>export MARKPATH=$HOME/.marks

function mark {
  mkdir -p "$MARKPATH"; ln -s "$(pwd)" "$MARKPATH/$1"
}

function unmark {
  rm -i "$MARKPATH/$1"
}

function marks {
  ls -l "$MARKPATH" | sed 's/  / /g' | cut -d' ' -f9- | sed 's/ -/\t-/g' &amp;&amp; echo
}

function jump {
  cd -P "$MARKPATH/$1" 2&gt;/dev/null || echo "No such mark: $1"
}
</code></pre>

<p>As well as a function generating completion suggestions after pressing <code>&lt;tab&gt;</code>:</p>

<pre><code>_completemarks() {
  local curw=${COMP_WORDS[COMP_CWORD]}
  local wordlist=$(find $MARKPATH -type l -printf "%f\n")
    COMPREPLY=($(compgen -W '${wordlist[@]}' -- "$curw"))
    return 0
}

complete -F _completemarks jump unmark
</code></pre>

<p>The workflow of marks is manual but convenient.
You have to go into the directory you want to bookmark and execute the <code>mark</code> command followed by the custom name, like <code>'mark myproject'</code>.
After that you can quickly jump back to this bookmarked folder using <code>'jump myproject'</code> and when the bookmark is no longer relevant you can get rid of it with <code>'unmark myproject'</code>.</p>

<p>With this approach the user is in control.
There is no secret smart behaviour which means no auto-magic and no surprises.
And after moving a project to another place the bookmark can be easily adjusted to point to its new location immediately, without waiting for a hidden automatic process to update its location, frequency, and recency.</p>

<p>But there was one problem.</p>

<h2 id="winter">Winter</h2>

<p>Neither of those <code>jump</code> nor <code>z</code> commands could take me everywhere I needed to go.
So the typical workflow would start with jumping to a project via the <code>jump</code> command but then switching to the old navigation via <code>cd</code> once inside it.
Which meant that for navigating the file system I always had to keep using both: <code>jump</code> and <code>cd</code>.
And having two distinct commands for doing the same thing felt a bit weird.
This is where I learned about the <code>$CDPATH</code><a href="#fn:3" id="fnref:3" title="see footnote"><sup>○</sup></a> variable and rolled out my own solution.</p>

<p>All you have to do is add this to your .bashrc:</p>

<pre><code>export CDPATH=.:~/.marks/

function mark {
  ln -sr "$(pwd)" ~/.marks/"$1"
}
</code></pre>

<p>Then, to add a bookmark called <code>@name</code> for the current directory:</p>

<pre><code>mark @name
</code></pre>

<p>To jump to its location:</p>

<pre><code>cd @name
</code></pre>

<p>To list all available bookmarks:</p>

<pre><code>cd @&lt;tab&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>And to delete a bookmark when it’s no longer needed:</p>

<pre><code>rm ~/.marks/@name
</code></pre>

<p><code>$CDPATH</code> solution works best when all the bookmarks are started with a special symbol which in my case was <code>@</code>.
This solves a couple of problems.
First, bookmarks, if prefixed with <code>@</code> symbol, will not interfere with directories in the current folder.
Second, all the available bookmarks will be displayed by typing <code>'cd @&lt;tab&gt;'</code>.
And third, all bookmarks are now part of <code>cd</code> and so they gain tab completion for free.
You can even use tab completion for jumping directly to folders nested within bookmarks by doing <code>'cd @bookmark/subfolder/'</code>.</p>

<p>Using this method you no longer have to maintain several custom functions and their autocompletion in .bashrc.
And the action for changing directory is always performed using the same familiar <code>cd</code> command, independent of whether the directory is a bookmark or not.</p>

<p>But there was one problem.</p>

<h2 id="springagain">Spring again</h2>

<p>After working with the <code>$CDPATH</code> approach for a while I began noticing something peculiar.
At no point in time did I have a list with a dozen or more bookmarks.
Instead I found myself constantly going to the same 2 or 3 projects, finishing them, removing them from <code>~/.marks/</code> folder, adding new ones, and repeating the cycle again.
Why would someone keep bookmarks for 3 directories?</p>

<p>This time, instead of changing the command, I tried to do something different and changed the folder structure.
My projects moved from the state of being relevant to being archived so why not create an archive directory and organize folders based not on their name or type but on state?
Thus the <code>"zzz"</code> folder was born.
And now my project structure looks something like this:</p>

<pre><code>└── work
    ├── active_project1
    ├── active_project2
    └── zzz
        ├── bitbucket
        │   └── user1
        │       ├── repo1
        │       └── repo2
        ├── github
        │   ├── user1
        │   │   ├── repo1
        │   │   └── repo2
        │   ├── user2
        │   │   ├── repo1
        │   │   └── repo2
        │   ├── user3
        │   │   ├── repo1
        │   │   ├── repo2
        │   │   ├── repo3
        │   │   └── repo4
        │   └── user4
        │       └── repo1
        ├── teaching
        │   ├── class1
        │   │   ├── lecture1
        │   │   └── lecture2
        │   └── class2
        │       ├── lecture1
        │       └── lecture2
        ├─── clients
        │   ├── client1
        │   │   ├── project1
        │   │   ├── project2
        │   │   └── project3
        │   ├── client2
        │   │   ├── project1
        │   │   ├── project2
        │   │   └── project3
        │   └── client3
        │      └── project1
        └─── ...
</code></pre>

<p>With this structure the bookmarking systems no longer provide big benefits as most frequent and recent folders are always under ~/work/some_project.
And since at any timepoint only a few of them are visible the tab completion will do its job: <code>'cd ~/w&lt;tab&gt;/s&lt;tab&gt;'</code>.</p>

<p>The name <code>"zzz"</code> might seem strange but is convenient: the letters “zzz” symbolically mark the projects within as being in a “sleeping” state while the 3 “z” letters in a row make sure that this folder is always placed at the very end of your active project list.
A nice folder structure is still maintained in the archive but for the ease of access all active folders are layed flat under the <code>~/work/</code> directory.
When the project is paused or completed it is moved to its place within the <code>"zzz"</code> hierarchy, maintaining the previous structure.
There is one extra benefit - contents of the <code>"work"</code> directory act as a reminder about all the projects that are in progress.
If necessary a to-do list with concrete details might be placed at the same level.</p>

<p>And just like that, like a newbie, I navigate the file system with <code>cd</code> and <code>ls</code> again.</p>

  <h3>git-rebase-conflicts</h3>
  
<h2 id="a-note-about-terminology">A note about terminology</h2>
<p>This article is about <code>git rebase</code> conflicts. A similar article with slightly different technical details could be written for <code>git merge</code> conflicts. I use “merge” as a non-technical term for combining the content of two different repository states, not to refer to <code>git merge</code>ing specifically.</p>
<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>When a git rebase conflict occurs you will be presented with a conflict region (or “hunk”) that shows why the rebased commit couldn’t be applied to the base branch. To resolve a rebase conflict, your task is to apply the logically-intended (i.e.&nbsp;semantic) change of the rebased commit to the base branch.</p>
<p>Some merge tools (for example <a href="https://emacs.stackexchange.com/questions/16469/how-to-merge-git-conflicts-in-emacs/16470#16470">Emacs SMerge</a>) offer you the option to “keep their changes” or “keep our changes”. This is almost always wrong. The whole point of merging (remember, I’m using that word in the non-technical sense, not to refer to <code>git merge</code>ing specifically) is to <em>combine</em> two conflicting things, not to choose one over the other. By choosing one you ignore a change in the other that may be required by other parts of the same commit (parts that may not see because they merged without conflict!).</p>
<p>The existence of a conflict means that the patches could not be merged textually. However, the aim is actually to merge them <em>semantically</em>. Merge tools are rarely (perhaps never) clever enough to be able to perform semantic merges so they settle for textual merges. In the cases where textual merges are not possible the task is left to human ingenuity.</p>
<p>Key takeaway: the aim is to apply the logical (i.e.&nbsp;semantic) content of the rebased commit to the base branch.</p>
<h2 id="summary-of-the-conflict-resolution-procedure">Summary of the conflict resolution procedure</h2>
<p>Resolving a rebase conflict requires understanding the logically intended (semantic) change of the rebased commit and applying it manually to the base branch. Here is the procedure to follow. The details will be explained by way of example later.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Issue the <code>git rebase</code> command.</p>
<p>Use the <code>diff3</code> conflict style option because it shows important information in the conflict markers that would otherwise be absent.</p>
<pre><code>git -c merge.conflictStyle=diff3 rebase ...</code></pre></li>
<li><p>For each conflict, observe the logical change that the rebased commit was intended to make.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Either look at the difference between the middle hunk section and the bottom hunk section of the marked conflict, or</p></li>
<li><p>look at <code>git show REBASE_HEAD</code></p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Observe the state of the base branch at each conflict region.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Either look at the top hunk section of the marked conflict, or</p></li>
<li><p>look at <code>git show HEAD:&lt;filename&gt;</code></p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Apply, to the base branch, the logical change that the rebased commit was intended to make.</p>
<p>This will probably be easiest to do by editing the top hunk section of the conflict and then deleting the others.</p></li>
<li><p>Add the file and continue the rebase, with <code>git add</code> and</p>
<pre><code>git -c merge.conflictStyle=diff3 rebase --continue</code></pre></li>
</ol>
<h2 id="why-use-diff3">Why use <code>diff3</code>?</h2>
<p>It is literally impossible to resolve conflicts using the default merge conflict style. I suggest setting <code>diff3</code> in your global options.</p>
<pre><code>git config --global merge.conflictStyle diff3</code></pre>
<p>Why is it literally impossible? Consider a branch which adds a function <code>foo1</code> at a particular source file location</p>
<div id="cb4"><pre><code><span id="cb4-1"><span>def</span> foo1():</span>
<span id="cb4-2">    <span>print</span>(<span>"foo1"</span>)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>and another branch which adds a function <code>foo2</code> at the same location</p>
<div id="cb5"><pre><code><span id="cb5-1"><span>def</span> foo2():</span>
<span id="cb5-2">    <span>print</span>(<span>"foo2"</span>)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>If I rebase one on the other I get a conflict. The default merge conflict style will show</p>
<div id="cb6"><pre><code><span id="cb6-1"><span>++&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; HEAD</span></span>
<span id="cb6-2"> +def foo1():</span>
<span id="cb6-3"> +    print("foo1")</span>
<span id="cb6-4"><span>++=======</span></span>
<span id="cb6-5"><span>+ def foo2():</span></span>
<span id="cb6-6"><span>+     print("foo2")</span></span>
<span id="cb6-7"><span>++&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Add foo2</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>What are the conflict markers telling me? They’re telling me that I need to <em>add</em> both <code>foo1</code> and <code>foo2</code> to the file, right? Unfortunately not! Consider a file in which <code>foo1</code> and <code>foo2</code> already exist, and two branches, one of which removes <code>foo1</code> and one of which removes <code>foo2</code>. If I rebase one on the other what is the result? The default merge conflict style will show</p>
<div id="cb7"><pre><code><span id="cb7-1"><span>++&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; HEAD</span></span>
<span id="cb7-2"> +def foo1():</span>
<span id="cb7-3"> +    print("foo1")</span>
<span id="cb7-4"><span>++=======</span></span>
<span id="cb7-5"><span>+ def foo2():</span></span>
<span id="cb7-6"><span>+     print("foo2")</span></span>
<span id="cb7-7"><span>++&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Remove foo1</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>Under the default conflict style the case of removing two functions is indistinguishable from the case of adding two functions (besides the text of the commit message which can only ever be a hint)! Therefore the default conflict style is insufficient for purpose of resolving conflicts. This probably explains why resolving conflicts is seen as a dark art. <code>diff3</code> not only makes it possible, below we will see that it is often easy.</p>
<h2 id="example-file">Example file</h2>
<p>The examples will based on changes to this example Python file.</p>
<div id="cb8"><pre><code><span id="cb8-1"><span>def</span> foo1():</span>
<span id="cb8-2">    <span>print</span>(<span>"foo1"</span>)</span>
<span id="cb8-3"></span>
<span id="cb8-4"><span>def</span> foo2():</span>
<span id="cb8-5">    <span>print</span>(<span>"foo2"</span>)</span>
<span id="cb8-6"></span>
<span id="cb8-7"><span>def</span> foo3():</span>
<span id="cb8-8">    <span>print</span>(<span>"foo3"</span>)</span>
<span id="cb8-9"></span>
<span id="cb8-10"><span>def</span> foo4():</span>
<span id="cb8-11">    <span>print</span>(<span>"foo4"</span>)</span>
<span id="cb8-12"></span>
<span id="cb8-13"><span>def</span> foo5():</span>
<span id="cb8-14">    <span>print</span>(<span>"foo5"</span>)</span>
<span id="cb8-15"></span>
<span id="cb8-16"><span>def</span> main():</span>
<span id="cb8-17">    foo1()</span>
<span id="cb8-18">    foo2()</span>
<span id="cb8-19">    foo3()</span></code></pre></div>
<h2 id="worked-example-adding-two-different-things">Worked example: adding two different things</h2>
<p>Suppose I have a patch that adds a call of <code>foo4</code> and another patch that adds a call of <code>foo5</code>, that is</p>
<div id="cb9"><pre><code><span id="cb9-1"> def main():</span>
<span id="cb9-2">     foo1()</span>
<span id="cb9-3">     foo2()</span>
<span id="cb9-4">     foo3()</span>
<span id="cb9-5"><span>+    foo4()</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>and</p>
<div id="cb10"><pre><code><span id="cb10-1"> def main():</span>
<span id="cb10-2">     foo1()</span>
<span id="cb10-3">     foo2()</span>
<span id="cb10-4">     foo3()</span>
<span id="cb10-5"><span>+    foo5()</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>If I try to rebase the latter on the former then the result is a conflict. The conflict is marked in the file by conflict markers, as below. This is sometimes referred to as a “hunk”. There are three sections in the hunk:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Between <code>&lt;&lt;&lt;</code> and <code>|||</code>: the state of the base branch, i.e.&nbsp;what the rebase commit actually saw when it tried to apply its change</p></li>
<li><p>Between <code>|||</code> and <code>===</code>: the state that the rebased commit expected to see</p></li>
<li><p>Between <code>===</code> and <code>&gt;&gt;&gt;</code>: what the result of applying the rebased commit would have been, if it had seen what it expected</p></li>
</ol>
<p>These three sections are always different from each other. If any pair were the same then there would be no conflict!</p>
<div id="cb11"><pre><code><span id="cb11-1">      foo1()</span>
<span id="cb11-2">      foo2()</span>
<span id="cb11-3">      foo3()</span>
<span id="cb11-4"><span>++&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; HEAD</span></span>
<span id="cb11-5"> +    foo4()</span>
<span id="cb11-6"><span>++||||||| merged common ancestors</span></span>
<span id="cb11-7"><span>++=======</span></span>
<span id="cb11-8"><span>+    foo5()</span></span>
<span id="cb11-9"><span>++&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Add foo 5</span></span></code></pre></div>
<h3 id="the-intent-of-the-rebased-commit">The intent of the rebased commit</h3>
<p>There are two equivalent ways to see the logical intent of the rebased commit.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>It is the difference between the middle hunk section (below “merged common ancestors”) and the bottom hunk section (above the commit description, “Add foo 5”).</p></li>
<li><p>It is shown in the output of <code>git show REBASE_HEAD</code>. This is generally easier to interpret than the above, but more verbose as it also contains diffs relating to non-conflicting parts of the commit. In this case it shows</p></li>
</ul>
<div id="cb12"><pre><code><span id="cb12-1">     foo1()</span>
<span id="cb12-2">     foo2()</span>
<span id="cb12-3">     foo3()</span>
<span id="cb12-4"><span>+    foo5()</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>Using either method you can see that the logical change of the rebased commit is to add <code>foo5()</code> after <code>foo3()</code>.</p>
<h3 id="the-state-of-the-base-branch">The state of the base branch</h3>
<p>There are two equivalent ways to see the state of the base branch.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The top hunk section (below <code>HEAD</code>)</p></li>
<li><p>The output of <code>git show HEAD:&lt;filename&gt;</code>. This latter form is probably less useful than the former because it shows the entire state of <code>&lt;filename&gt;</code> without drawing your attention to the conflicting section. In this case it shows</p></li>
</ul>
<pre><code>...
def main():
    foo1()
    foo2()
    foo3()
    foo4()</code></pre>
<p>Either way, you can see that the base branch has <code>foo4()</code> after <code>foo3()</code>.</p>
<h3 id="resolving-the-conflict">Resolving the conflict</h3>
<p>The correct way to resolve this conflict is to apply the logical change of the rebased commit—adding <code>foo5()</code> after <code>foo3()</code>—to state of the base branch—which has <code>foo4()</code> after <code>foo3()</code>. In your editor this will typically be easiest to do by making the change to the top hunk section and then deleting the other hunk sections. It requires semantic understanding to know exactly which way of resolving the conflict is satisfactory, if any. For example, we could put <code>foo5()</code> either before or after the appearance of <code>foo4()</code>. Let’s choose the latter and add <code>foo5()</code> below <code>foo4()</code> in the top hunk section (i.e.&nbsp;below <code>HEAD</code>).</p>
<div id="cb14"><pre><code><span id="cb14-1">      foo1()</span>
<span id="cb14-2">      foo2()</span>
<span id="cb14-3">      foo3()</span>
<span id="cb14-4"><span>++&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; HEAD</span></span>
<span id="cb14-5"> +    foo4()</span>
<span id="cb14-6"> +    foo5()</span>
<span id="cb14-7"><span>++||||||| merged common ancestors</span></span>
<span id="cb14-8"><span>++=======</span></span>
<span id="cb14-9"><span>+    foo5()</span></span>
<span id="cb14-10"><span>++&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Add foo 5</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>and then delete the middle and bottom hunk sections, and the conflict markers, to get</p>
<div id="cb15"><pre><code><span id="cb15-1"><span>def</span> main():</span>
<span id="cb15-2">    foo1()</span>
<span id="cb15-3">    foo2()</span>
<span id="cb15-4">    foo3()</span>
<span id="cb15-5">    foo4()</span>
<span id="cb15-6">    foo5()</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Once this change has been made the file can be <code>git add</code>ed and the rebase can continue via <code>git rebase --continue</code>.</p>
<h2 id="worked-example-removing-two-different-things">Worked example: removing two different things</h2>
<p>Suppose I have a patch that removes the call of <code>foo2</code> and another patch that removes the call of <code>foo3</code>, that is</p>
<div id="cb16"><pre><code><span id="cb16-1">def main():</span>
<span id="cb16-2">     foo1()</span>
<span id="cb16-3"><span>-    foo2()</span></span>
<span id="cb16-4">     foo3()</span></code></pre></div>
<p>and</p>
<div id="cb17"><pre><code><span id="cb17-1"> def main():</span>
<span id="cb17-2">     foo1()</span>
<span id="cb17-3">     foo2()</span>
<span id="cb17-4"><span>-    foo3()</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>If I try to rebase the latter onto the former the conflict is</p>
<div id="cb18"><pre><code><span id="cb18-1">      foo1()</span>
<span id="cb18-2"><span>++&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; HEAD</span></span>

<span id="cb18-8"><span>++    foo2()</span></span>
<span id="cb18-9"><span>++&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Remove foo3</span></span></code></pre></div>
<h3 id="the-intent-of-the-rebased-commit-1">The intent of the rebased commit</h3>
<p>By looking at the difference between the middle hunk section and the bottom hunk section, or by looking at <code>git show REBASE_HEAD</code>—which shows</p>
<div id="cb19"><pre><code><span id="cb19-1"> def main():</span>
<span id="cb19-2">     foo1()</span>
<span id="cb19-3">     foo2()</span>
<span id="cb19-4"><span>-    foo3()</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>—we can see that the intent of the rebased patch was to remove <code>foo3()</code>.</p>
<h3 id="the-state-of-the-base-branch-1">The state of the base branch</h3>
<p>On the other hand, the hunk section under <code>HEAD</code>, and <code>git show HEAD:&lt;filename&gt;</code>—which is</p>
<pre><code>def main():
    foo1()
    foo3()</code></pre>
<p>—show that the base branch does not contain <code>foo2()</code>, but <code>foo3()</code> is still there, ripe for removal. We need to apply the logical intent of the rebased patch to this context, which is done by removing the appearance of <code>foo3()</code> in the hunk section below <code>HEAD</code></p>
<div id="cb21"><pre><code><span id="cb21-1">      foo1()</span>
<span id="cb21-2"><span>++&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; HEAD</span></span>

<span id="cb21-8"><span>++&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Remove foo3</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>and then we delete the middle and bottom hunk sections and the conflict markers to get</p>
<pre><code>def main():
    foo1()</code></pre>
<h2 id="worked-example-one-addition-one-removal">Worked example: one addition, one removal</h2>
<p>If I rebase the addition of <code>foo4()</code> on the removal of <code>foo3()</code> the conflict is</p>
<pre><code>  def main():

      foo2()

<p><code>git show REBASE_HEAD</code> shows</p>
<pre><code>     foo1()
     foo2()
     foo3()
+    foo4()</code></pre>
<p>so the intention of the rebased commit is to add <code>foo4()</code>. Doing this in the top hunk section (i.e.&nbsp;below <code>HEAD</code>) leads to</p>

As a result, it is equipped with a system of specialized <strong><a aria-label="symbols (opens in a new tab)" href="https://mathvault.ca/hub/higher-math/math-symbols/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">symbols</a></strong> and <strong>vocabularies</strong> — each with its own level of generality and formality.</p><p>Among these, there’s a particular subset of terms that is uniquely foundational and appropriate to our pursuit: the <strong>higher mathematical jargon</strong>. Loosely speaking, these are a set of specialized terms that fall into most — if not all — of the following categories:</p><ul><li>Specific to <strong>higher mathematics</strong></li><li><strong>English-looking</strong> (with a near-technical meaning)</li><li><strong>Frequently-occurring</strong></li><li><strong>Cross-disciplinary</strong> (i.e., not field-specific)</li></ul><p>In brief, these are terms that are generally accessible to most, yet still provide us with a glimpse of the world of non-miniaturized mathematics — and the way their practitioners act and think. In fact, in what follows, we’ve compiled a list of 106 such terms — along with some in-depth exploration of their <strong>definitions</strong>, <strong>examples</strong>, <strong>relevance</strong> and <strong>implications</strong>.</p><p>So if you’re ready to dive into this fascinating world that is known as mathematics, then let’s get started!</p><p>(and if you’re looking for a concise rendition of all the 106 terms featured in this glossary, then you might find the following <strong>higher math jargon mindmap</strong> both interesting and useful.)</p><span></span><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://mathvault.ca/wp-content/uploads/Math-Glossary-Header-Image.png" alt="The Definitive Glossary of Higher Mathematical Jargons" width="1366" height="702" title="Math Glossary Header Image"></figure><h2 id="toc">Higher Mathematical Jargon — The Definitive List (106 Terms)</h2><p><span> The definitive glossary of higher mathematical jargon — from abstract nonsense, elementary proof to singularity and 101+ more. </span> <span><span>Click to Tweet</span><i></i></span></p><h2 id="abstraction"><a href="#toc">Abstraction</a></h2><p>The process of extracting the underlying <strong>structures</strong>, <strong>patterns</strong>, or <strong>properties</strong> of some mathematical objects, with the intention of generalizing these findings to a broader class of objects. These include, for example:</p><ul><li>Finding the <strong>shared properties</strong> of similar polynomials</li><li>Formalizing the <strong>general pattern</strong> of a sequence</li><li>Establishing a <a href="#otoc"><strong>one-to-one correspondence</strong></a> between two sets</li><li>Constructing an alternate <a href="#axiom"><strong>axiomatic system</strong></a> for Euclidean geometry</li></ul><p>At first, abstraction can seem a bit unappealing due to its higher cognitive demand and lack of connection to real-world phenomena. However, it can often turn out to be an integral force in bringing about a <strong>broaden applicability</strong> to a field — along with some <strong>unification</strong> in between the fields.</p><div><p>Did You Know?</p><p>While abstraction is involved in pretty much all subfields of mathematics, it is particularly well-represented in fields such as <strong>abstract algebra</strong>, <strong>model theory</strong>, <strong>axiomatic set theory</strong> and <a href="#nonsense"><strong>category theory</strong></a>.</p></div><h2 id="nonsense"><a href="#toc">Abstract Nonsense</a></h2><figure id="attachment_18333" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-18333"><img loading="lazy" src="https://mathvault.ca/wp-content/uploads/Category-Theory-Diagram.png" alt="Category Theory: A Category with Objects and Morphisms" width="325" height="325" title="Category Theory Diagram"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-18333">A category with objects $A$, $B$, $C$ and a series of morphisms.</figcaption></figure><p>A colloquial term for <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category_theory" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">category theory</a></strong> (a mathematical subject dedicated to the notion of category and the formalization of <a href="#structure">mathematical structures</a>), or the methods and arguments that are related to it.</p><p><span>Since different branches of mathematics deal with different mathematical structures satisfying the definition of a category, category theory can be regarded as a <strong>unifying theory</strong> of mathematics — whose results are applicable to a wide range of disciplines.</span></p><p>In particular, if a proposition follows from abstract nonsense, then it means that its argument has more to do with the underlying categorical structure of its objects — rather than the field where it’s found. And since such arguments are often highly abstract and long-winded by nature, they are also alternatively referred to as “<strong>general abstract nonsense</strong>” or “<strong>generalized abstract nonsense</strong>“.</p><h2 id="aon"><a href="#toc">Abuse of notation</a></h2><p>The act of inadvertently or deliberately using notations in a way that’s not entirely<strong> syntactically correct</strong> — but which simplifies the exposition and makes the passage easier to understand. For example, one might say that:</p><ul><li>“$\mathbb{R}$ is distributive” — rather than “$(\mathbb{R}, +, \times)$ is distributive.”</li><li>“$3$ is differentiable” — rather than “the function defined by the rule $x \mapsto 3$ for all real $x$, is differentiable.”</li><li>“$a+b+c = c+b+a$” — rather than “$(a+b) + c = (c+b) + a$”.</li></ul><p>In the cases where the context and the assumptions are made clear and well understood, abuses of notation are usually harmless (if not actually desirable). In other cases, however, the same might not be true, and can amount to a <strong>misuse of notation</strong> — which is a faux-pas in mathematics (such as the case of $\frac{\mathrm{d}y}{\mathrm{d}x}=\frac{y}{x}$).</p><h2 id="algo"><a href="#toc">Algorithm</a></h2><p>A finite series of <a href="#welldefined">well-defined</a>, <strong>computer-implementable instructions</strong> to solve a specific set of computable problems. It takes a finite amount of initial input(s), processes them unambiguously at each operation, before returning its outputs within a finite amount of time. Some examples of algorithm in mathematics include:</p><ul><li>The <strong>Euclidean algorithm</strong> (for finding the greatest common factor of two natural numbers)</li><li><a href="https://mathvault.ca/long-division">The <strong>long division algorithm</strong> (and its variants)</a></li><li>The <strong>simplex algorithm</strong> (for finding the optimal solution under a set of linear constraints)</li></ul><p>In essence, algorithms are created to streamline the solution-finding process for a specific set of problems, though it can also remove the necessity of thinking and understanding in the process. For a a series of instructions that are quasi-algorithmic and broader in nature, the term “<strong>general procedure</strong>” is sometimes used (which, like an algorithm, could also involve some element of <a href="#heuristics">heuristics</a> or <a href="#recursion">recursion</a>).</p><h2 id="almost"><a href="#toc">Almost</a></h2><figure id="attachment_18414" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-18414"><img loading="lazy" src="https://mathvault.ca/wp-content/uploads/Dart-and-Board.png" alt="Dart and Board" width="225" height="225" title="Dart and Board"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-18414">Since the actual circumference of the board has area 0, the probability of hitting it is also 0 as well (i.e., almost never).</figcaption></figure><p>A handy adverb similar to its usage in English, but can take on specific meanings depending on the context. For example:</p><ul><li>“<strong>Almost all</strong> elements in a set” usually means “all but a finite/countable amount of negligible elements in the set.”</li><li>“<strong>Almost no</strong> integer” usually means “only a finite subset of integers.”</li><li>“A property holds <strong>almost everywhere</strong> (in a measure space)” usually means “everywhere in a set except a subset of<a href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/MeasureZero.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> measure zero</a>.”</li><li>“An event occurs <strong>almost surely</strong>” usually means that “the event has a probability of 1, even though it does not include all of the possible outcomes.”</li><li>“An event occurs <strong>almost never</strong>” usually means that “the event has a probability of 0, even though it does contain some of the possible outcomes.”</li></ul><p>Here, notice that “almost” doesn’t necessarily mean that the <strong>exceptional cases</strong> are “small”, and hence one is perfectly well-justified in making claims such as “almost all real numbers are transcendental” — or that “the dart almost never lands on the circumference of the board.”</p><h2 id="ansatz"><a href="#toc">Ansatz</a></h2><p>A term of German origin meaning “initial placement of a tool at a work piece” (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ansatz" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wikipedia</a>), and is used in mathematics to refer to the initial, additional <strong>mathematical assumptions</strong> made to kick start the problem solving process — but which are later confirmed to be parts of the actual solution as well. Some examples of ansatz in mathematics include:</p><ul><li>The adoption of linear regression model to fit the data points (i.e., <strong>linear ansatz</strong>)</li><li>The assumption that the solutions to a differential/recurrent equation take an exponential form (<strong>exponential ansatz</strong>)</li><li>The assumption that the solution to a system of linear equations is expressible in terms of a particular vector (<strong>ansatz of particular solution</strong>).</li></ul><p>Metaphorically speaking, the use of ansatz can be liken to drawing a picture by first establishing a <strong>framework</strong>, in that if it succeeds, then the framework can be reused as an ansatz later on, but if it doesn’t, then it’s usually discarded and marked as an instance of failure.</p><h2 id="arbitrarily"><a href="#toc">Arbitrarily</a></h2><p>An adverb attached to a mathematical adjective X to make clear that something is “<strong>X with little limitation or restraint</strong>.” For example:</p><ul><li>An <strong>arbitrarily large</strong> function is a function capable of assuming values larger than any fixed choice of real number — regardless of the size of the latter.</li><li>An <strong>arbitrarily small</strong> positive sequence is a sequence capable of assuming values smaller than any fixed choice of positive real number — regardless of the “tininess” of the latter.</li><li>An <strong>arbitrarily long</strong> progression is a progression whose number of members can be made to exceed than any choice of natural number — regardless the size of the latter.</li></ul><p>In general, “arbitrarily” is a foundational term in number theory and mathematical analysis, and can also occur in other topics where some form of <strong>degree</strong> and <strong>ordering</strong> are involved (e.g., <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polynomial_ring" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">polynomial ring</a>).</p><div><p>Caution</p><p>Don’t make the mistake in assuming that “arbitrarily” means “infinitely”! If anything, “arbitrarily” usually carries a sense of being “without bound within the finite realm.”</p></div><h2 id="arbitrary"><a href="#toc">Arbitrary</a></h2><p>An adjective used to refer to a choice made without any specific criterion or restraint (e.g., arbitrary integer, arbitrary division of a set, arbitrary permutation of a sequence).

<p>Best-selling author Jim Collins famously coined the phrase “big, hairy, audacious goals.” Goals of this type are bold, important, and unexpected. They channel our vision; inspiring change in us and the people we serve.</p>



<p>For example: instead of saying “I’m going to learn a new recipe,” a big, hairy, audacious goal would be “I’m going to write an award-winning book on bread making.” Rather than committing to put aside 5% of your paycheck, you might drastically change your life hoping to become a millionaire in 10 years.</p>



<p>Big, hairy, audacious goals are fantastic–if you can deliver on them. And that is the problem. Anyone can come up with bluster.&nbsp;(If you can’t, there’s a sea of sales pitches with your name on them). But we’re all so sick of big, hairy, audacious, <em>unfulfilled</em> goals in New Year’s Resolutions, corporate propaganda, and marketing copy that we’ve all developed at least a little pessimism about goal setting.</p>



<p>Failure doesn’t inspire confidence. Period. We can learn from it. We can develop grace in loss. We can be better because of our humility. But an engine that misfires in most of its cylinders isn’t going to take us anywhere.</p>



<p>So instead of setting big goals, start tiny–much smaller than you have before. Choose goals that are actually feasible. Don’t worry that they may not move the needle right now. Small changes add up quickly.</p>



<p>You don’t need to scale hairy cliffs when smooth paths are an option. Going around the mountain may be better than going through it. And if you aren’t moving at all, the difficulty of your journey may prevent you from starting. Hard journeys will need to be done; build your strength now by starting somewhere.</p>



<p>Audacity alone may not be a problem–we all want to be bold in our convictions, and unexpected changes often inspire us. But there is little value in choosing surprising goals just because they sound great. Embrace goals that are critical: the ones you must keep to survive. As you develop confidence, you can level up until you’re working on satisfaction, fulfillment, and dreams. Be patient. Treat yourself when you can. But when your car is out of gas on the highway, don’t waste your time rewiring the stereo.</p>



<p>Goals matter. And there is a place for big, hairy, audacious goals. But the things that will actually change your life are almost always tiny, smooth, critical goals. Start there.</p>

<h2 id="vintage-dos-programs"><a href="#vintage-dos-programs">Vintage DOS Programs</a></h2>

<p>
Once in a while, I fire up one of the vintage DOS games or language
interpreters in DOSBox for nostalgia's sake. I have archived these
vintage programs at <a href="https://github.com/susam/dosage">github.com/susam/dosage</a>.
DOSBox is an emulator program that emulates IBM PC compatible computers
running DOS. Trying my hands on these antiquated DOS programs now evokes
old memories from my childhood days days when I first came across
computers as part of our primary school curriculum.
</p>

<p>
Computers were much simpler in those days. The ones in our school were
IBM PC compatible computers with mostly monochrome displays. A couple of
them had support for a very limited number of colours provided by CGA or
EGA graphics cards. The ability to boot a computer using a
5¼-inch floppy disk containing MS-DOS, load a Logo or BASIC
interpreter, or a computer game from another floppy disk, and then write
some programs or play a few games without any distraction had its own
charm that I find missing from modern day computing.
</p>

<p>
Often while using old DOS programs with DOSBox in this day and age, I
want to take screenshot captures or video captures of the DOSBox
sessions and share them with my friends. In this article, I will explain
how I create good quality screenshot captures and video captures of
DOSBox sessions in formats that I can share with others.

<h2 id="software-versions"><a href="#software-versions">Software Versions</a></h2>

<p>
Since this article involves several pieces of software, some of what is
written here may not hold good in future if the behaviour of any of
these software tools change in future. The list below contains the
versions of all software tools that were used to test the commands
provided in this article:
</p>

<ol>
  <li>macOS High Sierra 10.13.6</li>
  <li>DOSBox 0.74-3</li>
  <li>FFmpeg 4.3.1</li>
  <li>ImageMagick 7.0.10-28
  </li><li>IBM Personal Computer Logo Version 1.00</li>
  <li>Digger (Original PC booter version by Windmill Software)</li>
</ol>

<p>
Note that both Logo and Digger programs in the list above are DOS
programs that were released in 1983. They cannot be run directly on
modern computers but they can be run with DOSBox since it emulates old
IBM PC compatible computers.
</p>


<h2 id="ibm-pc-logo-in-dosbox"><a href="#ibm-pc-logo-in-dosbox">IBM PC Logo in DOSBox</a></h2>

<p>
IBM Personal Computer Logo developed by Logo Computer Systems Inc.
(LCSI) in 1983 was the first piece of software I got introduced to while
learning computers as a kid. I came across it at the age of 8 when I was
in Class 4 and our school had a 5¼-inch floppy disk with IBM PC
Logo on it. As a result, Logo was the first programming language I
learnt in my life. About 20 years later, I would realize that the first
programming language I learnt is a dialect of Lisp. How wonderful!

<p>
If the Logo interpreter program <code>LOGO.COM</code> exists in the
current directory, it can be run with DOSBox using the following
command:
</p>

<pre><code>dosbox LOGO.COM</code></pre>

<p>
One of the things I enjoyed drawing with Logo was a grid of overlapping
circles like this:
</p>

</figure>

<p>
Here is the Logo source code for the above output:
</p>

<pre><code>REPEAT 20 [REPEAT 180 [FD 1 RT 2] RT 18]</code>
</pre>


<h2 id="digger-in-dosbox"><a href="#digger-in-dosbox">Digger in DOSBox</a></h2>

<p>
At around the same time I learnt Logo, I also came across Digger, a
computer game for IBM PC developed by Windmill Software in 1983.
</p>

<figure id="digger-welcome-screenshot">
  <a href="https://susam.in/files/blog/dosbox-digger-0.png"><img src="https://susam.in/files/blog/dosbox-digger-0.png" alt="A screenshot of Digger welcome screen with the names and pictures of various game characters with a copyright notice of Windmill Software"></a>
  <figcaption>

  </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>
If the Digger program <code>DIGGER.COM</code> exists in the directory,
it can be run using DOSBox with the following command:
</p>

<pre><code>dosbox DIGGER.COM -c "config -set cpu cycles=500" -machine cga</code>
</pre>

<p>
The <code>-machine cga</code> option emulates a machine with Color
Graphics Adapter (CGA) because Digger requires a machine of this type to
run correctly. The <code>cycles=500</code> configuration option slows
down the speed at which DOSBox emulates instructions in order to emulate
the slow machines of olden days. Without this option, Digger runs too
fast to be able to be conveniently playable.
</p>

  <figcaption>

</figure>

<p>
Digger has an excellent gameplay where the player digs through
underground tunnels to pick up emeralds, drop gold bags to release the
gold or squash nobbins and hobbins, collect the released gold to earn
more points, and so on. It uses bright and attractive colours. The music
is great. When Digger was released in 1983, it was quite advanced for
its time.
</p>



<h2 id="dosbox-screenshot-capture"><a href="#dosbox-screenshot-capture">DOSBox Screenshot Capture</a></h2>

<p>
The screenshots above were obtained by running IBM PC Logo and the
original 1983 PC booter version of Digger on DOSBox and then resizing
the screenshots such that their aspect ratio matches the aspect ratio of
old CRT computer monitors.
</p>

<p>
To obtain the screenshots, we first press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> +
<kbd>F5</kbd> while DOSBox is running. The paths of the screenshots
appear in the console output at the terminal where DOSBox was launched.
For example:
</p>

<pre><samp>Capturing Screenshot to /Users/susam/Library/Preferences/capture/logo_000.png
Capturing Screenshot to /Users/susam/Library/Preferences/capture/logo_001.png</samp>
</pre>

<pre><samp>Capturing Screenshot to /Users/susam/Library/Preferences/capture/digger_000.png
Capturing Screenshot to /Users/susam/Library/Preferences/capture/digger_001.png</samp>
</pre>

<p>
The screenshots obtained in this manner have an aspect ratio of 8:5
which makes the output look stretched horizontally. The old CRT computer
monitors for which these old DOS programs were written had an aspect
ratio of 4:3 instead. This stretched look can be fixed by resizing the
images to an aspect ratio of 4:3. Here are the commands used to fix the
aspect ratio and produce the images:
</p>

<pre><code>convert logo_000.png -sample '1920x1440!' dosbox-logo-0.png
convert logo_001.png -sample '1920x1440!' dosbox-logo-1.png</code>
</pre>
<pre><code>convert digger_000.png -sample '1920x1440!' dosbox-digger-0.png
convert digger_001.png -sample '1920x1440!' dosbox-digger-1.png</code>
</pre>

<p>
The <code>convert</code> program comes with ImageMagick. There are a few
things worth noting here:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    We use the <code>-sample</code> option here to resize the image as
    opposed to using <code>-resize</code> or <code>-scale</code>. The
    <code>-resize</code> or <code>-scale</code> option would smooth the
    jagged edges in the text and graphics by introducing additional
    colours. The <code>-resize</code> option is great for real world
    images where we do want the edges to be smooth while scaling up or
    down but in these screenshots we want to retain the crisp and jagged
    edges that is typical of DOSBox and the old CRT monitors. Therefore
    we use the <code>-sample</code> option that does not introduce any
    new colours. Instead it uses nearest-neighbour interpolation (point
    sampling) to decide the colours of the scaled image.
  </li>
  <li>
    The <code>!</code> flag is used to ignore the aspect ratio of the
    original image. Without this flag, the output files would be
    1920x1200 in size, that is, the largest size with an aspect ratio of
    8:5 that fits in a 1920x1440 box. With this flag, the original
    aspect ratio of 8:5 is ignored and the output is exactly 1920x1440
    in size.
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="dosbox-video-capture"><a href="#dosbox-video-capture">DOSBox Video Capture</a></h2>

<p>
To start capturing video of DOSBox, we press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> +
<kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>F5</kbd>. The same key combination stops capturing
video. The following output appears in the console output to show where
the video file is saved:
</p>

<pre><samp>Capturing Video to /Users/susam/Library/Preferences/capture/logo_000.avi
Stopped capturing video.</samp>
</pre>

<p>
Say, I want to share a video capture of DOSBox with Logo running on it
with my friends who might be on devices that do not support playing AVI
files. The following FFmpeg command converts the video to a format that
can be distributed widely and played on a wide range of devices and
players:
</p>

<pre><code>ffmpeg -i logo_000.avi -an -c:v libx264 -preset veryslow \
       -crf 17 -vf format=yuv420p,scale=1920:1440:flags=neighbor,fps=30 \
       dosbox-logo.mp4</code>
</pre>

<p>
Here is what the output looks like:
</p>

<figure id="logo-video">
  <video controls="">
    <source src="https://susam.in/files/blog/dosbox-logo.mp4" type="video/mp4">

  <figcaption>
    Video capture of IBM Personal Computer Logo
    [<a href="https://susam.in/files/blog/dosbox-logo.mp4">MP4</a>]
  </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>
Let us briefly discuss the various FFmpeg options used here:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      <code>-i logo_000.avi</code>
    </p>
    <p>
      This, of course, specifies the input file.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <code>-an</code>
    </p>
    <p>
      The audio is silent in this video, so we reduce the file size a
      little by disabling the audio stream with this option. For
      example, without this option the output file size was 317 KB but
      with this option it turned out to be 282 KB.
    </p>
    <p>
      This option should not be specified if the audio stream needs to
      preserved, for example, with DOS games that have audio. We will
      see an example of this in the next section.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <code>-c:v libx264</code>
    </p>
    <p>
      This option selects the x264 encoder to encode the video stream
      into H.264 format. H.264 is also known as MPEG-4 Part 10, Advanced
      Video Coding (MPEG-4 AVC). Currently, it is the most popular
      format for recording, compression, and distribution of video
      content.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <code>-crf 17</code>
    </p>
    <p>
      This option provides visually lossless output, that is, high
      quality output without any loss in quality that can be perceived
      by human eyes. For completely lossless output, we need to use the
      <code>-crf 0</code> option. However, this option sets the video
      profile to <code>High 4:4:4 Predictive</code> which prevents the
      video from playing in some video players. This issue is discussed
      in more detail in the point about <code>yuv420p</code> pixel
      format that comes later in this list. Since <code>-crf 0</code>
      cannot be used due to this issue, the next best option is
      <code>-crf 1</code> which while not completely lossless is much
      better than …</p></li></ul></div></div>

<ul><li>Ethereum can reach to $1 Trillion transactions by the year end.</li><li>Bitcoin has 50% less transactional volume compared to Ethereum.</li></ul>



<p>The DeFi boom is setting new records and has been the talk of the show since its launch. The crypto market maintained its volatility, but the surge in DeFi kept increasing. This has led Ethereum to reach $1 trillion in volume transactions by the year.&nbsp;</p>



<figure><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/CtrOsljkHz9xabGpmYat-THEKwbGT2dcrhXtCtcxzuZAm-khYwhVm97lhab7ZpZmOlGKbgpQGXDKDrnf58Rf2YzU9TBjvvoq0a2kfCPit9reK7mGmpvlDZKAbfGLFb1cCPrgbXlR" alt=""><figcaption>Source: messari, coinmetrics</figcaption></figure>



<p>Ryan Watkins of Messari, a crypto research and news company, published a report that stated the market has peaked since the ICO boom of 2017. In his report, Ryan Watkins said that stablecoins and DeFi are the primary factors for the Ethereum increased volume transactions.</p>



<h2><strong>Ethereum versus Bitcoin&nbsp;</strong></h2>



<p>The report shows the comparison between the two most famous and debated cryptocurrencies; Bitcoin and Ethereum. It can be clearly seen that the ETH at present is transacting twice the volume of the BTC. Watkins commenting on the situation tweeted that when a product (DeFi) finds a market fit (Ethereum), the crypto-economy always booms.&nbsp;</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>🤯 Ethereum now transacts two times more value than Bitcoin daily.</p><p>This is what a cryptoeconomy looks like when it starts to find product-market fit.</p><p>1/ <a href="https://t.co/mjXJkZTddU">pic.twitter.com/mjXJkZTddU</a></p></div>— Ryan Watkins (@RyanWatkins_) <a href="https://twitter.com/RyanWatkins_/status/1318922143837659136?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 21, 2020</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>Not long back in August 2020, Chris Burniske of Placeholder, a venture capital partnership that invests in open blockchain networks in his tweet, predicted a similar scenario. In his tweet, he showed that if the $BTC will cross the $50,000 mark and $ETHBTC returns to former ATH, then a $1 trillion of transactional volume can be witnessed over either platform.&nbsp;</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>The past 30 days have witnessed Ethereum transacting volume of $7 billion while Bitcoin stands at less than $3 billion processing.&nbsp;</p>



<h3><strong>The Key Factors of Growth</strong></h3>



<p>It won’t be fair to comment that Ethereum grows large in volume on its own. When in reality, the DeFi boom, Stablecoin growth, the rise of the smart dollar, and completion of the stablecoin protocol, all of which occurred over the Ethereum network, were the reasons. The majority of Ethereum’s transactional volume is based on ERC-20 tokens. When <a href="https://twitter.com/RyanWatkins_/status/1318922153123844096">comparing </a>to the similar lines, Tether is transacting more volume than Bitcoin, but based on ERC-20 Tether.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Yield farming is pushing the demand-supply for growth percent greater than 600% for MakerDAO’s DAI stabelcoin. Decentralized Exchanges (DEXs) at <a href="https://twitter.com/RyanWatkins_/status/1318922157041307649">present </a>constitute 13.6% of total volumes from all exchanges, both centralized and decentralized. At the same time, Uniswap and Curve contributed more than $20 billion in the total volume for September.&nbsp;</p>



<h4><strong>Vitalik on the News</strong></h4>



<p>Vitalik Buterin, on the same, <a href="https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/1318940081869131776">tweeted </a>that the times are changing, and Ethereum is no more just an altcoin. And people should stop seeing the crypto world only through the lens of Bitcoins and widen their perspective.</p>

</section><p>Early in our mathematical education, we learn about a strong interplay between algebra and geometry—algebraic equations give rise to graphs and geometric figures, and geometric features can be encoded in algebraic expressions. It’s almost as if there’s a portal or bridge connecting these two realms in the grand landscape of mathematics: whatever occurs on one side of the bridge is mirrored on the other.<span id="more-12565"></span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://i1.wp.com/chalkdustmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/bridge.jpg?resize=429%2C383" alt="" width="429" height="383" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/chalkdustmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/bridge.jpg?resize=1024%2C915 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/chalkdustmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/bridge.jpg?resize=300%2C268 300w, https://i1.wp.com/chalkdustmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/bridge.jpg?resize=768%2C686 768w, https://i1.wp.com/chalkdustmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/bridge.jpg?resize=1%2C1 1w, https://i1.wp.com/chalkdustmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/bridge.jpg?w=1308 1308w, https://i1.wp.com/chalkdustmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/bridge.jpg?w=1962 1962w" sizes="(max-width: 429px) 100vw, 429px" data-recalc-dims="1"></p>
<p>So although algebra and geometry are very different areas of mathematics, this connection suggests that they are intrinsically related. Incidentally, the `bridge’ that spans them is a but a dim foreshadow of much deeper connections that exist between other branches of mathematics that also may, a priori, seem unrelated: set theory, group theory, linear algebra, topology, graph theory, differential geometry, and more. And what’s amazing is that these relationships—these bridges—are more than just a neat observation. They are <em>mathematics</em>, and that mathematics has a name: <em>category theory</em>.</p>
<h2>What is a category?</h2>
<p>Martin Kuppe once created a wonderful map of the mathematical landscape (see facing page) in which category theory hovers high above the ground, providing a sweeping vista of the terrain. It enables us to see relationships between various fields that are otherwise imperceptible at ground level, attesting that seemingly unrelated areas of mathematics aren’t so different after all. This becomes extraordinarily useful when you want to solve a problem in one realm (topology, say) but don’t have the right tools at your disposal. By ferrying the problem to a different realm (such as group theory), you’re able to see the problem in a different light and perhaps discover new tools that may help the solution become much easier. In fact, this is precisely how category theory came to be. It was birthed in the 1940s in an attempt to answer a difficult topological question by recasting it in an easier, algebraic light.</p>
<p>Thinking back to the mathematical landscape, you’ll notice that each realm consists of some objects (set theory has sets, group theory has groups, topology has topological spaces…) that relate to each other (sets relate via functions, groups relate via homomorphisms, topological spaces relate via continuous functions…) in sensible ways (such as composition and associativity).</p>

<p>This common thread weaves throughout the landscape and unites the various fields. The mathematics of category theory formalises this unification. More concretely, a <em>category</em> is a collection of <em>objects</em> with relationships between them (called <em>morphisms</em>) that behave nicely in terms of <em>composition</em> and <em>associativity</em>. This provides a template for mathematics, and depending on what you feed into that template, you’ll recover one of the mathematical realms: the category of sets consists of sets and relationships (ie functions) between them; the category of groups consists of groups and relationships (ie group homomorphisms) between them; the category of topological spaces consists of topological spaces and relationships (ie continuous functions) between them; and so on.</p>

<p>The analogy between a category and a template is due to Barry Mazur from his wonderfully written, non-technical introduction to category theory, <a href="http://www.math.harvard.edu/~mazur/preprints/when_is_one.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>When is one thing equal to some other thing?</em></a> In it he writes, “This concept of category is an omni-purpose affair… There is hardly any species of mathematical object that doesn’t fit into this convenient, and often enlightening, template.” Indeed, as category theorist <a href="http://chalkdustmagazine.com/interviews/in-conversation-with-eugenia-cheng/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Eugenia Cheng</a> so aptly put it in her treatise <a href="http://cheng.staff.shef.ac.uk/misc/4000.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Higher-dimensional category theory</em></a>, “category theory is the mathematics of mathematics”.</p>
<h2>It’s all about relationships</h2>
<p><a href="https://i2.wp.com/chalkdustmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/list.jpg"><img loading="lazy" src="https://i2.wp.com/chalkdustmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/list.jpg?resize=498%2C401" alt="" width="498" height="401" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/chalkdustmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/list.jpg?resize=1024%2C826 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/chalkdustmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/list.jpg?resize=300%2C242 300w, https://i2.wp.com/chalkdustmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/list.jpg?resize=768%2C619 768w, https://i2.wp.com/chalkdustmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/list.jpg?resize=1%2C1 1w, https://i2.wp.com/chalkdustmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/list.jpg?w=1048 1048w" sizes="(max-width: 498px) 100vw, 498px" data-recalc-dims="1"></a>One of the main features of category theory is that it strips away a lot of detail: it’s not really concerned with the individual elements in your set, or whether or not your group is solvable, or if your topological space has a countable basis. So you might be thinking, “Eh, category theory sounds so abstract. Can any good come from this?” Happily, the answer is yes! An advantage of ignoring details is that our attention is diverted away from the individual objects and turned towards the relationships—the morphisms—that exist between them. And as any category theorist will tell you, <em>relationships are everything.</em></p>
<p>Indeed, one of the main maxims of category theory is that <em>a mathematical object is completely determined by its relationships to all other objects</em>. To put it another way, two objects are essentially indistinguishable if and only if they relate to every object in the category in the same way. This theme (which is a consequence of a famous result called the Yoneda lemma) isn’t too different from what we observe in life. You can learn a lot about people by looking at their relationships—their Facebook friends, who they follow on Twitter, who they hang out with on Friday nights, for instance. And if you ever meet two people who have the <em>exact same</em> set of friends, and whose interactions on social media are <em>exactly the same</em>, and who hang out with the <em>exact same</em> people on Friday nights, then you might jokingly say, “You can’t even tell them apart”. Category theory informs us that, all jokes aside, this is actually true mathematically!</p>

So you might wonder “Hmm, if mathematical relationships are <em>that</em>&nbsp;important, then what about relationships between categories? Do <em>they</em>&nbsp;exist?” Great question. The answer is: absolutely! In fact, these particular relationships have a name—they are called <em>functors</em>. But why stop there? What about the relationships between those relationships? They, too, have a name: <em>natural transformations.</em></p>
<p>In fact, we can keep on going: “What about the relationships between the relationships between the relationships between the…?” Doing so will land us in higher-dimensional category theory, which is where much of Cheng’s research lies.</p>
<p>As abstract as this may sound, these constructions—categories, functors, and natural transformations—comprise a treasure trove of theory that shows up almost everywhere, in mathematics <em>and</em> in other disciplines! Since its inception, category theory has found natural applications in computer science, quantum physics, systems biology, chemistry, dynamical systems, and natural language processing, just to name a few. (The <a href="http://appliedcategorytheory.org/workshops">website</a> `Applied category theory’ contains a list of applications.) So even though category theory might sound a little abstract, it is highly applicable. And that’s no surprise. Category theory is all about relationships, and so is the world around us!</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Categories are a little bit like anchovies: some folks love ’em, while for other folks they’re an acquired taste. So yes, it’s true that category theory may not help you find a delta for your epsilon, or determine if your group of order 520 is simple, or construct a solution to your PDE. For those endeavours, we do have to put our feet back on the ground. But thinking categorically can help serve as a beacon—it can strengthen your intuition and sharpen your insight—as you trek through the nooks and crannies of your favourite mathematical realms. And these days it’s especially hard to escape the pervasiveness of category theory throughout modern mathematics. So whatever your mathematical goals may be, learning a bit about categories will be well worth your time!</p>

<p>(alternate title: Rationalizing writing pointless shell scripts)</p>
<p>You should create your own blog and start writing. At lest that's what people who write blogs say. Apparently there is something good about creating things of something. So let's give it a try.</p>
<p>However in order to start a blog one must first have a some kind of a blogging platform. The sane way to do this would be to use your search engine of choice and research the available solutions in order to find one that sounds the most appealing.</p>
<p>Unfortunately before I could do that I had two very bad thoughts that stuck in my mind:</p>
<ol>
<li><em>If it's about the joy of creation, why not also create the blogging platform?</em></li>
<li><em>Wait, wouldn't it be cool if my publishing command was <code>git push</code> and then Git hooks took care of the rest?</em></li>
</ol>
<p>The result, surprisingly, is somewhat usable.</p>
<h2 id="requirements">Requirements</h2>
<p>As a good little software engineer I began by listing some requirements upfront before I even started to write code:</p>
<ol>
<li>Ability to work offline.</li>
<li>Publishing via <code>git push</code> + some server hooks.</li>
<li>Being able to deploy locally for previews.</li>
<li>Generating static pages.</li>
<li>Being able to write in Markdown or directly in HTML.</li>
<li>Generating an Atom/RSS feed automatically.</li>
</ol>
<p>Doesn't sound too bad, right? So let's see what came out of it.</p>
<h2 id="the-result">The Result</h2>
<p>In the end I got the whole thing running with three short(-ish) scripts, lets look at the first one:</p>
<p><strong>deploy.sh:</strong></p>
<pre><code>#!/bin/sh

BASE=$(pwd)
TARGET=${TARGET:-~/target}
HEADER=$BASE/header.html
FOOTER=$BASE/footer.html

rm -rf "{$TARGET:?}"/*
find * -type d ! -path '\.\/\.*' -print | xargs -I DIR  sh -c "mkdir -p $TARGET/DIR; HEADER=$HEADER FOOTER=$FOOTER ./indexer.sh DIR $TARGET/DIR"

find . -type f -name '*md' -print | sed 's/md$//' | xargs -I NAME  sh -c " { cat $HEADER; pandoc $BASE/NAMEmd; cat $FOOTER; } &gt; $TARGET/NAMEhtml; echo $TARGET/NAMEhtml"

find . -type f ! -path '\.\/\.*' ! -name '*md' -print | grep -v -E "footer.html|header.html|index-header.html|$0|indexer.sh|feed-header.xml" | xargs -I NAME cp "$BASE/NAME" "$TARGET/NAME"</code></pre>
<p>Initially I imagined it would look a bit prettier but oh well. Essentially it's an uglier way to say:</p>
<ol start="0">
<li>Remove whatever was last deployed. (Pray that it would not <code>rm -rf /</code>)</li>
<li>Index every directory.</li>
<li>Parse every Markdown into HTML and insert it between the header and footer.</li>
<li>Copy any other arbitrary files which are not used in the previous steps.</li>
</ol>
<p>Lovingly step number 3 uses a hard-coded list. I'm sure that won't bite me in the future.</p>
<p>However there is one fun thing about indexing. If we remove the first <code>find</code> line from most "important" features of a blog will still function - you would still be able to write and publish. The indexing is "only" for generating the update feed and creating a little landing page where visitors of the blog could see all articles in a list, sorted with the most recent first - that detail is important. So let's talk about indexing now.</p>
<h2 id="indexing---the-8020-rule">Indexing - the 80/20 rule</h2>
<p>The <code>./indexer.sh</code> script mention in the last code block looks like this:</p>
<pre><code>#!/bin/sh

HOME="https://rilia.xyz/"
HTML_OUT=$2/index.html
ATOM_OUT=$2/feed.atom

feed_entry() {
  echo "
    &lt;entry&gt;
      &lt;title&gt;$3&lt;/title&gt;
      &lt;link href=\"${HOME}${1}.html\"/&gt;
      &lt;id&gt;${HOME}${1}.html&lt;/id&gt;
      &lt;updated&gt;$2&lt;/updated&gt;
      &lt;content type=\"xhtml\"&gt;
$(pandoc $4)
      &lt;/content&gt;
    &lt;/entry&gt;"
}

html_entry() {
  echo "&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"/$1.html\"&gt;$3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt; - $(echo $2 | sed 's/\ .*$//')&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"
}

cat "$HEADER" "$1"/index-header.html &gt; "$HTML_OUT"
echo '&lt;div class=feed&gt; &lt;a href=feed.atom&gt;Atom Feed&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;' &gt;&gt; "$HTML_OUT"

cat "$1"/feed-header.xml &gt; "$ATOM_OUT"
date --rfc-3339=seconds &gt;&gt; "$ATOM_OUT"
echo '&lt;/updated&gt;' &gt;&gt; "$ATOM_OUT"

for f in "$1"/*md
do
  git log --format="%at" --reverse "$f" | head -n 1 | xargs -I {} echo "{} $f"

done | sort -rn |  while read pair
do
  date=$(echo $pair | sed 's/\ .*$//')
  f=$(echo $pair | sed 's/^.*\ //')
  timestamp=$(date --date=@"$date" --rfc-3339=seconds)
  title=$(grep -m 1 -e '^#\ ' "$f" | sed 's/^#\ \ *//')
  location=$(echo "$f" | sed 's/\.md$//' | sed 's/^\.\///')

  feed_entry "$location" "$timestamp" "$title" "$f" &gt;&gt; "$ATOM_OUT"
  html_entry "$location" "$timestamp" "$title" &gt;&gt; "$HTML_OUT"
done

cat "$FOOTER" &gt;&gt; "$HTML_OUT"
echo '&lt;/feed&gt;' &gt;&gt; "$ATOM_OUT"

echo "$HTML_OUT"
echo "$ATOM_OUT"
</code></pre>
<p>Whelp... Can't really sugar coat that one, it's ugly. Fun side note, you might have heard bout the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle">80/20 rule</a>. One way to interpret it is that around 80% of the effort contributes to 20% of the final result. It doesn't really say that but bear with me: the two scripts are in total roughly 63 lines of code, from which <code>indexer.sh</code> is 51. That means that the indexing code is roughly 81% of the code base and probably of the total effort as well. Why was indexing difficult? Well it turns out that under Linux you cannot easily see the creating date of a file. You can do it under *BSD or Windows but the Linux kernel does not export some property of ext4 or something<a href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a>. I <em>could</em> migrate the server to *BSD or try to get a better version of the <code>stat</code> core utility. Luckily since I was already using git repo to hold the blog files I had a workaround<a href="#fn2" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a>, let's take a closer look at the following lines:</p>
<pre><code>for f in "$1"/*md
do
  git log --format="%at" --reverse "$f" | head -n 1 | xargs -I {} echo "{} $f"

done | sort -rn |  while read pair</code></pre>
<p>From the <code>git-log</code> manual it says that <code>%at</code> will display the "author date, UNIX timestamp". Therefore we can sort files based by querying when each one was added to the git repository. Probably very inefficient but it gets the job done and it works without any side effects. An alternative might be to use hooks that fire off on commits and appends the filename of the new files to a list. It would probably provide a good optimization for the total time it takes to update everything. The thing that worries me about that is that you would need to keep the list synchronised locally and with the server and also to try not to lose it. Perhaps the file could be part of the git repo? Possible optimizations for the future. At my current scale (one blog post) it doesn't really matter.</p>
<h2 id="the-git-hook">The Git Hook</h2>
<p>That one turned out easier than I expected, not much to say about it:</p>
<p><strong>post-update:</strong></p>
<pre><code>#!/bin/sh

unset GIT_INDEX_FILE

rm -rf /tmp/deploy
mkdir -p /tmp/deploy
GIT_DIR='/var/git/rilia.git'
git --work-tree=/tmp/deploy checkout -f
(cd /tmp/deploy; TARGET='/var/www/rilia' ./deploy.sh)</code></pre>
<h2 id="benefits-of-doing-it-this-way">Benefits of doing it this way</h2>
<p>I'm not sure but there might be some merit to using Git for a blogging platform:</p>
<ul>
<li>Relatively few dependencies</li>
</ul>
<p>Of course ignoring the big one - git, but I already wanted to have a private git server anyway so it was easily justifiable. Also for Markdown I use <code>pandoc</code>, but you could try some simpler tool or even a different templating language, <code>htlatex</code> is a thing.</p>
<ul>
<li>No active server</li>
</ul>
<p>At some point I checked <a href="https://gohugo.io/">hugo</a> since I overheard it was a good choice for making static sites. However configuration files scare me as well as having another server process active all the time. The git repo solution runs only on updates.</p>
<p>There is also <a href="https://mkws.sh/">mkws</a> which looks like a cool project, but I learned about it after being mostly done with the scripts.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>I dunno, make stuff or something. Generating HTML is not <em>that</em> difficult so if the idea of making your own platform sounds appealing just go for it. Writing the scripts was somewhat fun even if I'm not a big fan of the POSIX shell syntax. In the end you might find a novel way to do a relatively simple thing and on its own that could be fun.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
	<p>I kinda hate myself for writing this post like a revelation in the times of pandemic and talking about remote work while it is <em>hot topic</em> . In reality, I have been working 100% remotely for more than 2 years (I previously worked for more than 8 years in the offices) and right now I feel I can tell my experiences about remote work and why I will probably never go back to a regular office job.</p>
<p>Around 2 years ago I got the offer to join MailerLite as a remote contractor. I was over-thinking whether I should start working remotely, what would it mean for me, my habits, social life, and my career progress. There were too many unknowns at that point as I have only done some freelance gigs remotely, but have been involved with distributed teams all over the world in previous companies. I took the red pill and my remote journey began.</p>
<p>All my doubts were cleared right away.</p>
<p>The first one - traffic. I hate the traffic in Belgrade. The city isn’t building its infrastructure (roads, bridges) as fast as it is growing and it is showing. On a good day, it took around 30 minutes of driving to work, which is not a problem. But, in the majority of days going to work and back home took on average 2 hours. I say 2 hours because you have to take into account that you have to find a parking space, probably 10 minutes from the office, and then walk to the office which all adds to 2 hours of lost time each day. If you calculate - it means that you are losing <strong>22 days per year</strong> in the traffic.</p>
<p>What could you do with that extra <em>time</em> that you have? I remember one analogy when I talked to one of my friends as he said: “It is like when people are telling that smokers could put all money they spend on cigarettes aside and can buy a new car after some time of saving. Then you see people who stopped smoking and after some time you don’t see them with a new car”. That wasn’t the case for me. I rediscovered hobbies that I have stopped practicing because of lack of time - started playing guitar more, recording new music, and most importantly, I had time to read more non-business related books. You can become dull and get into a work-home-sleep routine because of the lack of time.</p>
<p>Micromanagement was the other thing that I thought could happen in remote work. Fortunately, it didn’t. It is just a matter if you trust your employees or not. If you don’t trust your employees, you either didn’t hire the right people for your company or you are suffering from trust issues and adapting to the situation. Usually, it is the second thing. People who slack off because there aren’t any measures of control because they are working remotely show their faces and bad habits really fast and you can easily filter them.</p>
<p>When working remotely, <strong>you are your own manager</strong>. You must plan your time and goals, and how much you give yourself to work. Not too little and not too much, balance, as always, is the key.</p>
<p>There are so many tools to make communication while working remotely easy. We utilize Slack, have regular calls on Zoom, write our monthly feedback on 15five, and much more. If we need to brainstorm, we get on a video call or write in Slack.</p>
<p>There is one potential downside of working remotely for one target group - junior engineers. I will explain why I don’t think it is a rule but purely depends on the person. While junior engineers can always sit next to their mentors in a regular office job, here it is a bit different. Your company has to have really good documentation and processes so they don’t get lost. But, on the other hand, at MailerLite we are always looking for persons that are “self-starters” and can pick-up things themselves without or with minimal interference from other colleagues. In my experience, juniors can struggle at the beginning for the first (half of) year, but after that, they are usually stronger with knowledge and work ethics than juniors in regular offices. They are more independent in work and can easily learn new things and implement them.</p>
<p>The key thing in remote work is overcommunication. I can’t stress enough how much it is important. As a pitfall of remote work, you must write and overshare because there is no such thing as over-communication. Why do we do that? We are a remote-first company, but we have an office in Vilnius if someone wants to work from it. A couple of people are working from the office, but as I have been there a couple of times it is the most silent office I have ever been in. The communication is done via Slack or conference calls with everyone, so no one is left out, as this can be a problem when you have a combination of office and remote work in your company.</p>
<p>Productivity, personally, is sky-rocketing once I switched to the remote. I get at least 50% more stuff done as there are no distractions, unnecessary small-talks, listening to office gossips, braggings, and other things that can happen in the office.</p>
<p>Freedom is also an important thing. Sometimes I have to do something personal in the morning, or the middle of the day. Sometimes, I can go to the gym during the day and go back refreshed and start working. I can go to my hometown when I want to and work from there. I can travel wherever I want and work from there. I have become more social as I have more time for my friends and family and am less stressed. No one is looking at how much time you are spending working - but if you did the task or not which is the only important thing.</p>
<p>The biggest indicator that remote work is a benefit for both an employee and the company is that Microsoft and Google are now permanently remote if you want to. Pandemic nudged them in that direction, but they have seen the benefits and adapted.</p>
<p>Times are changing. Gosh, what a cliche sentence. <strong>Times are always changing, it is up to us if we want to adapt</strong>. Remote work has been around for a long time, but most of the companies resisted the change. I’m happy that companies are now forced to change because it requires a change of mindset, but there is a quote from my favourite TV series of all time, Twin Peaks, <em>“There’s some fear in letting go”</em>.</p>

<p>This is going to be a short walk in the product development zoo, I hope you’ll enjoy the ride!</p>
<p><em>Caveat</em>: what you’ll read about are (usually) not personality types but behaviors in a specific (type of) situation. Acting like a HIPPO, a WOLF, a RHINO or a ZEBRA doesn’t make anyone a bad person. You’re still a team, aim to understand where they are coming from, and, well, they might even be right, with the wrong communication style. </p>

<p>It can be tempting to give in to the HIPPOs – founders or CEO or VPS who want to make all the decisions – but don’t let them steer you off course.</p>
<p>Bring everything back to your vision and objectives. If the HIPPOs aren’t aligned with those, you could be headed for dangerous waters.</p>
<p>Don’t let your HiPPO kill your ideas – inform them with data and make them a <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/bernardmarr/2017/10/26/data-driven-decision-making-beware-of-the-hippo-effect/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Data-driven HiPPO</a>! </p>

<h2>The WOLF – Working On the Latest Fire</h2>
<div>
<div>
<p>The WOLF has a short attention span and a temptation to jump from one problem to the next. They tend to only enjoy fighting fires, This will disrupt your team’s focus and effectiveness, making you easy prey for your competitors.</p>
<p>Create a process for collecting feedback about problems, bugs and only consider these along with all other requests. Set up triaging and set clear priorities and a method for prioritization.</p>
<p>There’s a whole book on WOLF prioritization: <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1942788290/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Phoenix Project</a></p>

<p>The RHINO is just there to collect a paycheck without contributing much to the team. They might not be actively impeding your decision-making, but they are not helping much either. </p>
<p>Having a clearly defined prioritization process can help ensure all your team members understand how decisions are made and give them the confidence to actively participate. Hopefully, in this process, everyone is empowered to have a say and it doesn’t turn into “Well our process is that the boss tells you what’s important” – which is exactly how you end up with a team of disillusioned RHINOs.</p>

<h2>The ZEBRA – Zero Evidence But Really Arrogant</h2>
<div>
<div>
<p>ZEBRAs think they know it all but rely on their instinct rather than any actual evidence. To stave off the ZEBRAs in your midst, make sure that you’ve got data to back up your decisions.</p>
<p>Come up with quick experiments you can run to test ideas and gather evidence. Push for a data-driven culture.</p>

<h2>And one extra…. the RHINO again! This time, Really High value New Opportunity</h2>
<p>Usually, it’s a salesperson with an amazing value customer deal for an unplanned feature insisting re-allocating resources to build what’s required to win the deal. The results, sadly, are an ignored strategy and roadmap and resources allocated to serve a single customer.</p>
<p>There are two ways here:</p>
<p>1, Chase the RHINO away: Compare the opportunity cost and value and argue against signing the deal if you have customer insight supporting the roadmap.<br>2, Tame the RHINO: Adjust the roadmap if the opportunity includes features you already had planned for later in the year.</p>

      <h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>

<p>Sometimes, when I remotely login to some Linux computers or use Docker containers, I would find the shell is plain black and white, different from the colorful shell I am used to dealing with on my local machine. This sometimes makes it difficult to look for libraries, executables, and folders. Sometimes, some executables could be called directly from a local shell but from a remote login shell they are not directly callable.</p>



<p>It turns out that the shell is an executable and it is “configured” by special shell scripts such as <code>~/.bashrc</code>, <code>~/.profile</code>, <code>~/.bash_profile</code>. In this blog post, I would like to briefly discuss the differences between these scripts.</p>

<h3 id="bashrc">~/.bashrc</h3>

<p>I modify the <code>~/.bashrc</code> file from time to time, because sometimes I would like to set some environment variables, including <code>PATH</code> which is an environmental variable in Linux and other Unix-like operating systems that tells the shell which directories to search when looking for executable files. But I have been ignoring the commented block at its beginning for decades.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>$ cat ~/.bashrc 
# ~/.bashrc: executed by bash(1) for non-login shells.
# see /usr/share/doc/bash/examples/startup-files (in the package bash-doc)
# for examples
...
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This means that in a local shell where <code>bash</code> is being used, this shell script will be executed immediately after <code>bash</code> is executed. There are many other shell executable variants, such as <code>zsh</code>. <code>~/.bashrc</code> is only specific to <code>bash</code>.</p>



<p>There are many settings in the <code>~/.bashrc</code> that makes the shell look colorful. For example,</p>

<div><div><pre><code># enable color support of ls and also add handy aliases
if [ -x /usr/bin/dircolors ]; then
    test -r ~/.dircolors &amp;&amp; eval "$(dircolors -b ~/.dircolors)" || eval "$(dircolors -b)"
    alias ls='ls --color=auto'
    #alias dir='dir --color=auto'
    #alias vdir='vdir --color=auto'

    alias grep='grep --color=auto'
    alias fgrep='fgrep --color=auto'
    alias egrep='egrep --color=auto'
fi
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="profile">~/.profile</h3>

<p>The comment block found in the <code>~/.profile</code> explicitly tells us that it will be executed for the login shells. However, if <code>~/.bash_profile</code> or <code>~/.bash_login</code> exists, <code>~/.profile</code> will not be executed.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>$ cat ~/.profile 
# ~/.profile: executed by the command interpreter for login shells.
# This file is not read by bash(1), if ~/.bash_profile or ~/.bash_login
# exists.
# see /usr/share/doc/bash/examples/startup-files for examples.
# the files are located in the bash-doc package.

# the default umask is set in /etc/profile; for setting the umask
# for ssh logins, install and configure the libpam-umask package.
#umask 022

# if running bash
if [ -n "$BASH_VERSION" ]; then
    # include .bashrc if it exists
    if [ -f "$HOME/.bashrc" ]; then
	. "$HOME/.bashrc"
    fi
fi

# set PATH so it includes user's private bin if it exists
if [ -d "$HOME/bin" ] ; then
    PATH="$HOME/bin:$PATH"
fi

# set PATH so it includes user's private bin if it exists
if [ -d "$HOME/.local/bin" ] ; then
    PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"
fi
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The default content of the <code>~/.profile</code> is simple. In most cases, it inherits whatever is in the <code>~/.bashrc</code>, and adds some user specific executable filepath to the environment variable <code>PATH</code>. So if there are commands that make the shell look colorful in the <code>~/.bashrc</code>, the login shell should also look colorful.</p>

<h3 id="bash_profile">~/.bash_profile</h3>

<p>Unfortunately, in most of my login trials, the shells were never colorful, and sometimes the environment variables did not match my expectation. In those cases, this is because there exists a <code>~/.bash_profile</code> and therefore <code>~/.profile</code> or <code>~/.bashrc</code> is never executed. Usually the <code>~/.bash_profile</code> will be empty, which means that we would not have the environment and appearance that we have in our local shell.</p>



<p>To make the login shell “back to normal”, we could either delete the <code>~/.bash_profile</code> or modify the <code>~/.bash_profile</code> by adding some commands like</p>



<h3 id="caveats">Caveats</h3>

<p>Sometimes, a non-color shell could be helpful. It can be used to indicate that you are not working in local shell, and that what you are seeing could either be a Docker shell or a remote login shell. When we know what shell we are dealing with, we will be more likely to avoid dangerous operations. For example, in a Docker shell, we could do almost anything, such as <code>rm -rf /</code> without sudo, without harming the local system.</p>

        <p>Many interesting problems in computer science are expressible as problems on
graphs: Finding the shortest path between two vertices, calculating a spanning
tree, finding a large independent set, etc. Often in Theoretical Computer
Science we only look for a theoretical solution - once we know how to model a
specific problem as graph we give an algorithm in pseudocode and leave it at
that. We will try an unconventional method practically solving these problems
using bash.</p>

<p>At ETH, Computer Science Master students learn how to efficiently (and
practically) solve graph problems in the Algorithms Lab, using
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B">C++</a> and
<a href="https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_66_0/libs/graph/doc/index.html">BGL</a><sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6">1</a></sup>. In
this course it is not enough to come up with a theoretical algorithm. One also
have to implement and pass testcases as part of his solution. The BGL offers
many sophisticated graph algorithms, each one cleverly optimized in order to
make the generated code as fast as possible. It does its job well: It makes it
(relatively) easy to use sophisticated graph theoretic algorithms in practice.
But it is hugo and complicated. Is there maybe an easier way to solve graph
problems on a computer, without having to implement most of the boring
algorithms and without installing a bazillion dependencies?</p>

<p>It turns out that we can (ab)use just about any Linux system for this, and we do
not even need a C++ compiler, or any other compiler for that matter. All we need
is any run-of-the-mill shell (bash will do just fine), and some standard system
utilities such as <code>find(1)</code>, <code>tr(1)</code>, <code>paste(1)</code>, <code>cut(1)</code>, etc.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1">2</a></sup>, which (for
GNU/Linux systems) are packaged in the so-called <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/coreutils/">GNU
<code>coreutils</code></a>. Most other systems
provide similar, if not the same, commands - they may be packaged differently
however.</p>

<h3 id="pathfinding-in-trees">Pathfinding in trees</h3>

<p>We will start with a simple problem: Given an undirected, acyclic and connected
graph, commonly known as <em>tree</em>, find the unique path between two vertices i and
j of said tree.</p>

<p>The first problem we have to solve is <em>representing</em> our graph. Recall from that
there are may possible ways to represent graphs: Adjacency lists, (for each
vertex list all its neighbors), Adjacency matrices (entry (i, j) is 1 iff edge
(i, j) exists), and many more. The most obvious solution would be to put all of
that information in a text file and then operate on that, but then we would be
no further than C++, since we would still have to implement most of the
algorithms by hand. So let us go up a step in the hierarchy: If files are bad,
can we maybe use directories instead?</p>

<p>It turns out that this works nicely, but only when our graph is a <em>rooted
tree</em>. In a rooted tree we choose an arbitrary vertex as root and then list all
vertices ordered by their distance from the root: First comes the root itself,
then the root’s neighbors, then the root’s neighbors’ neighbors, etc. Let
us have a look at an example, a tree rooted at vertex 0:</p>

<figure>
    <img src="https://blog.3fx.ch/post/images/rooted-tree.svg" width="300px"> 
</figure>


<p>We can easily translate this tree into a directory structure:</p>

<pre><code>mkdir -p 0/1/3/{4,5}
mkdir -p 0/2/6
</code></pre>

<p>How do we display our tree? The best utility I know for this task is aptly named
<code>tree(1)</code>. Sadly, it is not part of the GNU coreutils and you most likely have
to install it with your favorite package manager. Running <code>tree</code> then shows us
the tree we constructed:</p>

<pre><code>% tree
.
└── 0
    ├── 1
    │&nbsp;&nbsp; └── 3
    │&nbsp;&nbsp;     ├── 4
    │&nbsp;&nbsp;     └── 5
    └── 2
        └── 6
</code></pre>

<p>Now we can answer questions such as “How can I get from 0 to i?”, where i is an
arbitrary vertex other<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4">3</a></sup> of our tree using the <code>find(1)</code> command. The <code>find</code>
command traverses all files in a given directory, and can optionally search for
specific criteria, for example directory names. If we wanted to know how to get
from vertex 0 to vertex 3 we can run the following command:</p>

<pre><code>% find 0 -name 3
0/1/3
</code></pre>

<p>which tells us that we can go from 0 to 3 via vertex 1. In fact, we can
generalize this to arbitrary vertices i and j: First we check how to get from 0
to i, and then from 0 to j, and finally we have to find the common ancestor of
both paths. Then we reverse the path from 0 to i (now it is a path from i to 0),
walk along it until we hit the common ancestor of i and j, and then walk down
the path from the common ancestor to j.</p>

<p>The most difficult part of this procedure is finding the common ancestor. Lucky
for us the package <code>diffutils</code> provides the <code>cmp(1)</code> command, which can tell us
the first byte at which two files differ. The output of cmp is a bit verbose,
but using <code>cut(1)</code> and <code>tr(1)</code> from the coreutils we can extract the
relevant information:</p>

<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">% cmp &lt;<span>(</span><span>echo</span> <span>"testa"</span><span>)</span> &lt;<span>(</span><span>echo</span> <span>"testb"</span><span>)</span>
/proc/self/fd/11 /proc/self/fd/12 differ: byte <span>5</span>, line <span>1</span>
% cmp &lt;<span>(</span><span>echo</span> <span>"testa"</span><span>)</span> &lt;<span>(</span><span>echo</span> <span>"testb"</span><span>)</span> <span>|</span> cut -d <span>" "</span> -f <span>5</span> <span>|</span> tr -cd <span>"[:digit:]"</span>
<span>5</span></code></pre></div>

<p>How does this work? The program <code>cut</code> takes a delimiter (<code>-d</code>) and some position
number (<code>-f</code>) and returns the string at the given position (1-indexed) when
splitting on the delimiter specified by <code>-d</code>. We use <code>tr</code> to delete (<code>-d</code>) all
non-digits (<code>-c</code> stands for the complement of the character set) to ensure that
we get <code>5</code> as result, and not <code>5,</code>. So far so good, let us look where we are
now:</p>

<div><pre><code data-lang="bash"><span># In Bash arguments are passed implicitly and referenced</span>
<span># using $1, $2, etc. We use $1 as i and $2 as j</span>
path_between<span>()</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>path_to_i</span><span>=</span><span>$(</span>find -name <span>$1</span><span>)</span>
    <span>path_to_j</span><span>=</span><span>$(</span>find -name <span>$2</span><span>)</span>

    <span>first_diff_byte</span><span>=</span><span>$(</span>cmp &lt;<span>(</span><span>echo</span> <span>$path_to_i</span><span>)</span> &lt;<span>(</span><span>echo</span> <span>$path_to_j</span><span>)</span> <span>\
</span><span></span>            <span>|</span> cut -d <span>" "</span> -f <span>5</span> <span>\
</span><span></span>            <span>|</span> tr -c -d <span>'[:digit:]'</span><span>)</span></code></pre></div>

<p>It remains to find the common ancestor of i and j. Since we know where the paths
differ, we know up to which character they are identical. Using <a href="https://www.tldp.org/LDP/abs/html/parameter-substitution.html">bash variable
expansion</a> we can
identify the common prefix, and using <code>cut</code> extract the vertex they have in
common. The <code>rev</code> command from the <code>util-linux</code> package reverses a string of
characters:</p>

<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">    <span>common_prefix</span><span>=</span><span>${</span><span>path_to_i</span><span>:</span><span>0</span><span>:(( </span><span>$first_diff_byte</span><span> - 1 ))</span><span>}</span>
    <span>common_ancestor</span><span>=</span><span>$(</span><span>echo</span> -n <span>$common_prefix</span> <span>|</span> rev <span>|</span> cut -d / -f <span>2</span> <span>|</span> rev<span>)</span></code></pre></div>

<p>The part in the double parenthesis is subject to the <code>expr(1)</code> command<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2">4</a></sup>, which
and evaluates the expression as arithmetic expression. Now all we have left to
do is to stick all of it together:</p>

<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">    <span># if we omit local here we set $PATH...</span>
    <span>local</span> <span>path</span><span>=</span><span>$(</span><span>echo</span> <span>${</span><span>path_to_i</span><span>#</span><span>"</span><span>$common_prefix</span><span>"</span><span>}</span> <span>\
</span><span></span>        <span>|</span> tr <span>'/'</span> <span>$'\n'</span> <span>\
</span><span></span>        <span>|</span> tac <span>\
</span><span></span>        <span>|</span> paste -s -d <span>'/'</span><span>)</span>
    <span>path</span><span>=</span><span>$path</span>/<span>$common_ancestor</span>/<span>${</span><span>path_to_j</span><span>#</span><span>"</span><span>$common_prefix</span><span>"</span><span>}</span>

    <span>echo</span> <span>$path</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>

<p>Using the <code>tr</code>, <code>tac</code> and <code>paste</code> commands (all part of coreutils) we can
reverse the path from i to the common ancestor of i and j. We do this by
changing the slashes which delimit our vertices to newlines and using
<code>tac</code><sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3">5</a></sup> to reverse the order of our vertices. Finally
we can use <code>paste</code> to put the reversed vertices back together in a single string
and then append the path from the common ancestor to j.</p>

<p>Testing it on our input graph gives the following output:</p>

<pre><code>% path_between 4 5
4/3/5
% path_between 5 4
5/3/4
% path_between 0 5
/.//1/3/5
% path_between 3 4
/1//4
</code></pre>

<p>It seems like it fails when the common ancestor is either i or j. We can remedy
thisby handling these cases separately: If i is the common ancestor, we can
simply take the path from i to j minus the path from 0 to the ancestor of i.
Else if j is the common ancestor then we have to first reverse the path from j
to i (so we get the path from i to j) and the remove the path to j’s ancestor.</p>

<div><pre><code data-lang="bash"><span>if</span> <span>[[</span> <span>$common_prefix</span> <span>==</span> <span>$path_to_i</span> <span>]]</span><span>;</span> <span>then</span>
    <span>local</span> <span>path</span><span>=</span><span>$1</span><span>${</span><span>path_to_j</span><span>#</span><span>"</span><span>$common_prefix</span><span>"</span><span>}</span>
<span>elif</span> <span>[[</span> <span>$common_prefix</span> <span>==</span> <span>$path_to_j</span> <span>]]</span><span>;</span> <span>then</span>
    <span>local</span> <span>path</span><span>=</span><span>$(</span><span>echo</span> <span>${</span><span>path_to_i</span><span>#</span><span>"</span><span>$common_prefix</span><span>"</span><span>}</span> <span>\
</span><span></span>        <span>|</span> tr <span>'/'</span> <span>$'\n'</span> <span>\
</span><span></span>        <span>|</span> tac <span>\
</span><span></span>        <span>|</span> paste -s -d /<span>)</span>
    <span>path</span><span>=</span><span>$path$2</span>
<span>else</span>
    <span># Do what we did before</span>
<span>fi</span></code></pre></div>

<p>Now it gives correct results for any query:</p>

<pre><code>% path_between 3 4
3/4
% path_between 4 3
4/3
% path_between 6 4
6/2/0/1/3/4
% path_between 0 1
0/1
% path_between 1 0
1/0
</code></pre>

<p>That’s it. In 20 lines of bash we wrote a pathfinding algorithm for trees. Not
only that, but we did it without needing to compile any code, only using tools
available on most Linux systems! I find that quite impressive.</p>

<h3 id="pathfinding-in-general-graphs">Pathfinding in general graphs</h3>

<p>Restricting ourselves to rooted trees sounds pretty limiting doesn’t it? Can we
generalize our model to arbitrary graphs? At first it seems like we cannot,
since then our file system (which is where we store our graph) does not support
cycles. After all, no directory can be a (grand-)parent of itself. But it turns
out that using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbolic_link">symbolic links</a> we
can “point” to other directories, which can in turn point to other directories,
which can point to other directories, etc. We can create symlinks using the <code>ln</code>
command (incidentally also found in coreutils), by writing <code>ln -s &lt;directory
point to&gt; &lt;name of the link&gt;</code>. For each vertex we want to create a directory and
in that directory create symbolic links to all of its neighbors.  If you recall
the different forms of graph representation before this corresponds to adjacency
lists. Let us try this with a simple example:</p>

<figure>
    <img src="https://blog.3fx.ch/post/images/graph.svg" width="100%"> 
</figure>


<p>We can create the graph as follows:</p>

<pre><code>% mkdir `seq 0 5`
% ln -s ../0 1
% ln -s ../1 0
% ln -s ../2 0
% ln -s ../0 2
% &lt;continue for each edge&gt;
% tree
.
├── 0
│&nbsp;&nbsp; ├── 1 -&gt; ../1
│&nbsp;&nbsp; └── 2 -&gt; ../2
├── 1
│&nbsp;&nbsp; ├── 0 -&gt; ../0
│&nbsp;&nbsp; └── 2 -&gt; ../2
├── 2
│&nbsp;&nbsp; ├── 0 -&gt; ../0
│&nbsp;&nbsp; ├── 1 -&gt; ../1
│&nbsp;&nbsp; └── 4 -&gt; ../4
├── 3
│&nbsp;&nbsp; └── 4 -&gt; ../4
├── 4
│&nbsp;&nbsp; ├── 2 -&gt; ../2
│&nbsp;&nbsp; ├── 3 -&gt; ../3
│&nbsp;&nbsp; └── 5 -&gt; ../5
└── 5 &nbsp;&nbsp;
    └── 4 -&gt; ../4
</code></pre>

<p>Now let us look at the same problem as before: We want to specify two vertices i
and j, and want to find a path between them (if it exists).  Last time we used
the <code>find(1)</code> utility to find these. This time we will explicitly tell <code>find</code> in
which vertex i we would like to start by specifying it as the root of our
search:</p>

<pre><code>% find 0/ -name 1
0/1
% find 0/ -name 3
&lt;nothing&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Hmm, it seems as if <code>find</code> does not follow the symbolic links. Looking at
<code>find</code>’s manual page (<code>man find</code>) we see the following</p>

<pre><code>OPTIONS The  -H, -L and -P options control the treatment of symbolic links.

[...]

-P     Never  follow  symbolic  links.  This is the default behaviour.  When
       find examines or prints …</code></pre></article></div></div>

<p>With software engineering, speed and memory are the basic measurement-benchmarks. For programming language implementations, the two affect each other heavily. In JIT compilers, that means storing more things in memory to speed up the program drastically. It also means putting time into garbage collection to keep memory down, spending time to try to eliminate allocations and deciding where to put some piece of data. </p>
<p>Escape Analysis is a technique that determines the behaviour of how a variable (more specifically, a pointer) is used in a certain scope, and whether it not it escapes that scope (the scope is usually a function). Escape analysis allows the program to stack allocate (here is an article on <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/79923/what-and-where-are-the-stack-and-heap/80113#80113">Stack vs Heap </a>allocations) when it's determined the variable will not be used outside of the scope or in other cases, try to eliminate the allocation completely. </p>

</h3>
<p>Pypy puts a lot of work into minimizing <em>boxing</em>, which is done through escape analysis. Boxing is when a primitive is boxed into an object wrapper type, such as an <code>int</code> to <code>Integer</code> in Java. Object oriented language implementations often utilize boxing (sometimes called auto-boxing), including JavaScript, C#, Haskell and others! Computers natively understands types like booleans and integers, but not objects, and unfortunately many languages need to store most of their data as an object and not the primitive. For example, <code>314</code> as a constant can be stored as a primitive on the stack, but when <code>314.toString()</code> is executed, <code>314</code> has to be boxed so that the method can be run on the object. Unboxing is performed to extract the value. </p>
<p>Boxing and unboxing is an expensive operation, with .NET citing 20x the time for boxed assignment and 4x the time for unboxing assignment (when you explicitly cast back). Pypy also has expensive boxing operations, as it's not just assigning/computing more values but organizing them into a heap structure. </p>
<p>Pypy considers this to be its second most important problem, and uses "virtual objects", also called virtualisation. It's a fancy term that means they avoid creating the entire heap structure, store the primitive value (not on the heap) and mock any object-operations that need to happen. While the virtual object is used in some applicable scope, read and writes are done to the virtual object without the expense of boxing/unboxing. Even more computation is saved as since the virtual object exists and no guards need to exist to verify information about the value in the object, whereas guards are usually in place to check the class after loading a value. </p>
<p>Pypy will virtualise onto the stack optimistically and then allocate later should it become necssary. Escape analysis is really powerful in JITs mostly because jitted langauges tend to be more dynamic, but also because they can very aggressively stack allocate.  Languages that compile once have to be completely confident that the escape analysis is valid (or also compile code in case of failure) <em>and</em> make decisions about how far it should look to determine a scope. JITs can kind of just hope it'll work and then actually do the allocation if it doesn't -- and remember what happened for next time (though that makes it sound a lot easier than it actually is). </p>
<p>For example;</p>
<pre><code><span>x </span><span>= </span><span>0
</span><span>for </span><span>i </span><span>in </span><span>range</span><span>(</span><span>10000</span><span>):
  </span><span># Integer.random() is not an actual stdlib operation in Python, I used it to indicate a non-primitive object is created
  </span><span>y </span><span>= </span><span>Integer</span><span>.</span><span>random</span><span>() </span><span>+ </span><span>x
  x </span><span>+= </span><span>y </span><span>* </span><span>4 </span><span># this would also involves boxing without escape analysis, since operators are implemented as methods
</span><span>print</span><span>(x)
</span></code></pre>
<p>There are two cases of virtualisation here. The first is <code>y</code>, which will be virtualised as it does not escape. Thus in the second line of the loop, Pypy would no longer need a guard for the value of <code>y</code>. This saves us a lot more than just constructing and traversing the heap structure. When boxed, Pypy has to check the class types of <code>y</code> and <code>x</code> due to the dynamic-ness of Python -- can these values be added? If they can, where is the method to describe how they are added (Python allows operator overloading). It also has to recreate a boxed object to reassign to <code>y</code> and in more complex cases could leave behind additional garbage for the GC. </p>
<p><code>x</code> on the other hand, does escape, but it's still valuable to virtualise it, for that allocation is in a loop and the escape is outside the loop. When a jump instruction comes in (loop ends), it’ll come with code that actually allocates <code>x</code> for the garbage collector and future use. Another case of escape analysis can be found in methods;</p>
<pre><code><span>def </span><span>foo</span><span>():
  x </span><span>= </span><span>{</span><span>"A"</span><span>: </span><span>1</span><span>, </span><span>"B"</span><span>: </span><span>2</span><span>}
  </span><span>return </span><span>x[</span><span>"A"</span><span>]
</span></code></pre>
<p>In this case, <code>x</code> will likely never escape and the allocation isn't even needed to execute the rest of the function. This particular case may actually be constant-folded away (the constant is replicated at usage sites), but abstractions of this pattern will use escape analysis. Escape analysis also often takes place for language-internal operations, and I'll describe how Javascript features and internals makes escape analysis very important. </p>
<h3 id="how-javascript-uses-escape-analysis-in-language-internals">How Javascript Uses Escape Analysis in Language Internals<a href="#how-javascript-uses-escape-analysis-in-language-internals" aria-label="Anchor link for: how-javascript-uses-escape-analysis-in-language-internals"> <i></i></a>
</h3>
<p>The most complex question about escape analysis (other than maybe "how do I implement it") is probably "is this only beneficial to very shortlived variables, and if so how does it help much?". As mentioned in the Pypy example, it is sometimes to protect allocations that are made by the language implementation rather than the programmer. Here's a quick example in Javascript (example token from <a href="https://www.jfokus.se/jfokus18/preso/Escape-Analysis-in-V8.pdf">this PDF</a>, which has a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KiWEWLwQ3oI">corresponding talk</a> that might be elementary at this point in the blog post). </p>
<pre><code><span>function </span><span>bar</span><span>(</span><span>o</span><span>) </span><span>{
  </span><span>return </span><span>Math</span><span>.</span><span>sqrt</span><span>(</span><span>o</span><span>.</span><span>x</span><span>*</span><span>o</span><span>.</span><span>x </span><span>+ </span><span>o</span><span>.</span><span>y</span><span>*</span><span>o</span><span>.</span><span>y)
</span><span>}

</span><span>function </span><span>foo</span><span>(</span><span>i</span><span>) </span><span>{
  </span><span>return </span><span>bar</span><span>(</span><span>{</span><span>x: </span><span>i</span><span>, y: </span><span>i}</span><span>)
</span><span>}
</span></code></pre>
<p>One might not expect anything to allocate even without escape analysis, but when you create the object to pass into <code>bar</code> it is created and allocated by default since it now exists for <code>bar</code> and can escape <code>bar</code>. This is a good example of a full allocation elimination, the allocation isn't just moved into the stack, rarther <code>bar</code> is inlined and then the usage of any object at all can be optimized away. </p>
<h3 id="luajit-allocation-sinking">LuaJIT Allocation Sinking<a href="#luajit-allocation-sinking" aria-label="Anchor link for: luajit-allocation-sinking"> <i></i></a>
</h3>
<p>In most languages that box, essentially everything gets a box (except <code>null</code> and <code>undefined</code> types, though <code>NaN</code> in Javascript is boxed into a <code>Number</code> so terms and conditions may apply). LuaJIT is smarter off the bat and manages to not box floats and is good at not allocating (when I say "allocate", I mean to the heap) constants. </p>
<p>LuaJIT's does something called <a href="http://wiki.luajit.org/Allocation-Sinking-Optimization"><em>Allocation Sinking</em></a>, which is based on escape analysis and the result is very powerful allocation removals, doing things that even the age-old Hotspot can't do. Pypy implemented a vast majority of the things that LuaJIT did (see this <a href="http://www1.maths.lth.se/matematiklth/vision/publdb/reports/pdf/ardo-bolz-etal-dls-12.pdf">2012 paper</a>) though I'd want to describe some of these optimizations in the context of LuaJIT rather than Pypy because LuaJIT gave me free examples. </p>
<p>When data is allocated, there's typically a "store" and then a "load" later on. Store-to-load forwarding is essentially what it sounds like, getting the subsequent "load" function to receive data directly from the location of storing. This is used to have powerful allocation sinking, more commonly called "code motion" (or specifically, loop-invariant code motion as JITs tend to be concerned with loop optimizations). This examples do not use executable Lua code</p>
<pre><code><span>local </span><span>x </span><span>= </span><span>0
</span><span>for </span><span>i</span><span>=</span><span>1</span><span>,</span><span>1000 </span><span>do
  </span><span>x </span><span>= </span><span>y </span><span>+ </span><span>z </span><span>-- i don't think this actually allocates in lua, but let’s pretend it does
  </span><span>local </span><span>a </span><span>= </span><span>i </span><span>+ </span><span>x
</span><span>end
</span></code></pre>
<p>What we want is for <code>x</code> to be declared outside of the loop, as it saves us that allocation every time we iterate. This could be done through code motion. </p>
<pre><code><span>local </span><span>x </span><span>= </span><span>y </span><span>+ </span><span>z 
</span><span>for </span><span>i</span><span>=</span><span>1</span><span>,</span><span>1000 </span><span>do
  </span><span>a </span><span>= </span><span>i </span><span>+ </span><span>x
</span><span>end
</span></code></pre>
<p>In the example below, the allocation of <code>i</code> to <code>y</code> should be moved to be inside the conditional. Note that this optimization is not quite covered by the base strategy described for Pypy.</p>
<pre><code><span>for </span><span>i</span><span>=</span><span>1</span><span>,</span><span>1000 </span><span>do  
  local </span><span>y </span><span>= </span><span>i
  </span><span>if </span><span>random</span><span>() </span><span>&gt; </span><span>0.5</span><span>:  </span><span>-- but does not escape this if statement
    </span><span>x </span><span>= </span><span>y </span><span>+ </span><span>z
  </span><span>local </span><span>a </span><span>= </span><span>i </span><span>+ </span><span>x
</span><span>end
</span><span>-- should become
</span><span>for </span><span>i</span><span>=</span><span>1</span><span>,</span><span>1000 </span><span>do  
  if </span><span>random</span><span>() </span><span>&gt; </span><span>0.5</span><span>: 
    </span><span>local</span><span> </span><span>y </span><span>= </span><span>i
    x </span><span>= </span><span>y </span><span>+ </span><span>z
  </span><span>local </span><span>a </span><span>= </span><span>i </span><span>+ </span><span>x
</span><span>end
</span></code></pre>
<p>Here, LuaJIT defers the write and <em>forwards</em> the data to the read. As a result, the allocation and read is very much removed. The forwarding destination is the point of escape, which is where the escape analysis comes in. </p>
<p>LuaJIT has an explicit mark-and-sweep pass to do sinks. For an example that highlights the allocation sinking, LuaJIT performed on par with C++ and 700x faster than Lua. Specifically (taken from the <a href="http://wiki.luajit.org/Allocation-Sinking-Optimization#implementation%5B">LuaJIT Blog</a>): </p>
<pre><code><span>local </span><span>ffi </span><span>= </span><span>require</span><span>(</span><span>"ffi"</span><span>)
</span><span>local </span><span>point
point </span><span>= </span><span>ffi</span><span>.</span><span>metatype</span><span>(</span><span>"struct { double x, y; }"</span><span>, </span><span>{
  </span><span>__add </span><span>= </span><span>function</span><span>(</span><span>a</span><span>, </span><span>b</span><span>)
   </span><span>return </span><span>point</span><span>(</span><span>a</span><span>.</span><span>x </span><span>+ </span><span>b</span><span>.</span><span>x, </span><span>a</span><span>.</span><span>y </span><span>+ </span><span>b</span><span>.</span><span>y)
  </span><span>end
</span><span>}</span><span>)
</span><span>local </span><span>a</span><span>, </span><span>b </span><span>= </span><span>point</span><span>(</span><span>1.5</span><span>, </span><span>2.5</span><span>), </span><span>point</span><span>(</span><span>3.25</span><span>, </span><span>4.75</span><span>)
</span><span>for </span><span>i</span><span>=</span><span>1</span><span>,</span><span>100000000 </span><span>do </span><span>a </span><span>= </span><span>(</span><span>a </span><span>+ </span><span>b</span><span>) </span><span>+ </span><span>b </span><span>end
</span><span>print</span><span>(</span><span>a</span><span>.</span><span>x, </span><span>a</span><span>.</span><span>y)
</span></code></pre>
<p>This example does some things that are familiar from the Pypy example -- it creates temporary objects while performing the arithmetic (<code>point(a.x + b.x, a.y + b.y)</code>). These two under-the-hood allocations are expensive, but LuaJIT optimizes …</p></section></div>

<p><span>Elon Musk: SpaceX is gearing up to make satellite Internet available to the education sector in a bid to bridge the digital divide.</span></p>
<p><span>SpaceX’s Starlink satellite internet service is <a href="https://www.de24.news/2020/10/spacexs-starlink-to-provide-free-satellite-internet-to-families-in-the-texas-school-district.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">collaborating</a> with a Texas school district to make free broadband available to several families in the surrounding rural area by 2021. This is the first time Elon Musk’s aerospace company has partnered with a school district to use Starlink to the Ector County Independent School District, which announced the collaboration on Oct. 20th.</span></p>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Pe13MqRa2Wg" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p><span>The school district will initially provide 45 families living in rural Pleasant Farms with high-speed internet, before extending the service to 90 other families. According to a local media company, Odessa America, the project will set the company back a whopping $300,000 with half of the funding coming from education advocacy group Chiefs for Change.</span></p>
<p><span>“Our research clearly shows that the lack of broadband access is a crisis in Ector County,” the school district’s superintendent Scott Muri said in a statement.</span></p>
<p><span>The district, west of Dallas, Texas, needs broadband access to enable online learning during the coronavirus pandemic, which has led to schools across the country being closed or restricted to the number of students in physical classrooms. The district’s own surveys show 39 percent of families either have limited or no access to the Internet. SpaceX’s Starlink has accepted the challenge to fill this gap.</span></p>
<p><span>The company’s system currently dols out download speeds of 100 Mbps, with a latency of around 30 milliseconds, which is similar to the ground-based Internet. SpaceX plans to bring satellite internet to Texas, an American state in the lower latitudes. The company has assured it will soon be rolling out a public beta for Starlink, but in the higher latitudes for locations in the northern US and southern Canada.</span></p>
<p><span>By next year, SpaceX plans to put more satellites into orbit in its attempt to power the Starlink network, and enhance broadband coverage. Starlink operates more than 800 satellites, but the target is to have thousands more in orbit. The company is expected to roll out the satellite Internet system to users around the world in 2021, however, details about the cost are still scarce.</span></p>
<p><span>The Ector County’s Independent School District believes that Starlink will permanently fix and solve the broadband problems across the state.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>   <p>TL;DR: Just how big is the recently-hyped “Tools of Thought” market? Maybe there’s so many people on the web now you can actually make a business selling sports cars to the intellectual elite?</p> <hr> <p>During the first dot-com bubble, the Internet had 4M people. Today it has over 2B. That’s kind of obvious. What’s less obvious is the double growth: not just in <em>number</em>, but also in <em>quality</em>. This isn’t the generation who got computers when they were 50. These are a new generation that was born online. The mode Internet user is much more likely to care about keyboard shortcuts.</p> <p>Said differently, we now have a large market of “bionic users”. People who are half melded into the machine. Users that like keyboard shortcuts, care about speed, care about productivity, etc. (Some people call these “prosumers”, but that term feels as jaded as Apple’s Aqua UI.)</p> <p>The first company I started was a search engine. We were acquired by Apple, and our product was melded into Spotlight. The pitch was sleek, hyperfast search across all of your personal data. We tried both consumer and enterprise markets, but we found most success in the third market of high-end power users. The issue was it was 2010. It’s really fun building for the bionic elite, but there wasn’t enough of them to justify a long term business.</p> <p>Several things have changed since:</p> <ul> <li>It is technically easier to pay for things on the Internet.</li> <li>It is <em>emotionally</em> easier to pay for things on the Internet. It’s something you do frequently.</li> <li>There are more power users on the Internet who care about high-octane fast software. Partially because there are more software developers now, and software developers are often bionic users.</li> <li>There are more people on the Internet with the ability to pay for it.</li> <li>It is easier to reach those people.</li> </ul> <p>I think this effect fueled the early growth of companies like <a href="https://roamresearch.com/">Roam Research</a>, <a href="https://notion.so/">Notion</a>, <a href="https://airtable.com/">Airtable</a>, <a href="https://superhuman.com/">Superhuman</a>, <a href="https://zapier.com/">Zapier</a>, <a href="https://getpocket.com/">Pocket</a>, and others. Some of those achieved scale by going upmarket and charging enterprises for collaboration features, but it’s possible that you could have a material business selling to power users alone. It’s also worth noting the alternative take on this: pure enterprise. <a href="https://retool.com/">Retool</a> is a good example of this, forgoing the appeal to the bionic and focusing on deployment within a company. (Others mentioned have an enterprise component too. Everyone does everything. I think the key distinction is in the heart and soul of the company. Is self-serve the first or second act? Slice by that.)</p> <h4 id="tam">TAM</h4> <p>There are anywhere between 6-50M software developers in the world. According to Wikipedia, Github has 40M active users. The more reasonable estimates I’ve found are closer to 23M software developers. To me, this is a good rough sizing of the bionic market. That is, it’s probably &gt; 1M and &lt; 100M. (I would appreciate any deeper analysis of this if anyone has it!)</p> <h4 id="high-octane-software">High Octane Software</h4> <p>The first is a very liberating one to those that have productivity at heart: Yes you can! You can focus on 50ms response time, autocomplete, eye tracking, or whatever whacky idea you have to make something really, really nifty.</p> <h4 id="bionic-bundling">Bionic Bundling</h4> <p>Maybe Notion and Roam Research should get married? Apple Music and Microsoft Teams were a great tour de force of the power of bundling and having established sales channels. It is interesting to think of who might build the reseller channel to power users. This is the type of thing you earn the right to build – so I’d imagine it would be one of the Bionic Incumbents doing this first.</p> <h4 id="bionic-bootstrapping">Bionic Bootstrapping</h4> <p>If you’ve made it this far, congratulations! You’re somewhat of a determined reader to slog through this morass of words I’ve cobbled together. If you’re curious to get validation on a labor of love you’re working on, you should check out Pioneer. That’s kind of why we made it. I’m not going to link to it here, because I presume a true bionic user can easily find it themselves. (Scroll down!)</p> </article></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <p><span id="hs_cos_wrapper_post_body" data-hs-cos-general-type="meta_field" data-hs-cos-type="rich_text"><p>According to the World Health Organization (WHO), about 15% of the world's population lives with some form of disability. That seemingly small percentage makes up more than 1 billion of the world’s population. In other words, about 1 out of 8 people will have difficulty navigating through design that is only made for “the average person”.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>When you’re attempting to understand accessibility, it’s important to listen to and interact with real people with disabilities in your research. What do they need? What kinds of designs are burdensome to them? What has worked for them so far, and what hasn’t?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Understanding their needs requires empathy, and empathy is the foundation for good, inclusive, and accessible design.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you’re just starting out on understanding accessibility, this breakdown might be helpful to you. Here are five basic aspects of design that you should pay attention to when designing for accessibility.</p>
<h2><strong>Language</strong></h2>
<p>When it comes to the words on your digital product, use simple language and avoid jargon to cater to users on all levels of language proficiency. Simple language includes all, but complex language excludes people who only use the language on a basic level.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Use non-textual cues like pictures and colors&nbsp;to include non-literate users, and allow voice input and autocomplete text fields to accommodate people who aren't able to use keyboards.</p>
<p>When writing for accessibility, it's always important to optimize content for people who use assistive technology like screen readers. This includes being specific with button labels, and giving context to action buttons. For example, “Add to Cart” would be more understandable than just “Add”, because it mentions the subject of the action.</p>
<h2><strong>Color and Contrast</strong></h2>
<p>Avoid using design that solely depends on color to be understood. Take Google Maps for example — red is used to indicate traffic congestion, and green to indicate clear roads. But along with that, they also include a brief breakdown on the traffic condition in text, and provide the option for voice directions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you have to use design that depends on color, it’s always good to include labels or other visual cues. Otherwise, make use of contrast to help users with low vision and color blindness interact with and better understand color-coded visual cues.</p>
<p>Contrast is important for users to distinguish between text and non-text elements. This is required for good readability for not only the visually impaired, but also able-bodied users. Under bright sunlight or with low screen brightness, a bad contrast ratio would negatively affect any user’s experience on your app or website.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/visual-audio-contrast-contrast.html"><span>W3C</span></a> recommends a minimum contrast ratio of 3:1 for large text (14pt bold or 18pt regular and above), and 4.5:1 for smaller text or when visual impairment is accounted for.&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>Hierarchy</strong></h2>
<p>Your UI should have a simple and clear hierarchy of importance. For example, action items should be positioned at the top or bottom of the screen, or have shortcuts for easy access.</p>
<p>The reason why important elements are recommended to be at the top of the screen isn’t only because it’s common. It also helps with accessibility by including people who use screen readers. When these users explore the elements on a screen by touch, they experience an interface linearly, from top to bottom.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since screen readers rely on the top-down structure of HTML, for accessibility’s sake, it’s important for developers and designers to keep the top-bottom left-right visual hierarchy in mind when deciding on the arrangement of elements including images, texts, and buttons.</p>
<h2><strong>Privacy and Security</strong></h2>
<p>Privacy isn’t something most of us have to think too much about, but it is for users with vision or hearing impairments, or simply those who depend on voice commands, assistive technology, or other people to complete tasks. Making private information secure is important in order to make your website or app accessible beyond the able-bodied user.</p>
<p>One way to do that is by providing controls for personal information to be hidden when prompted, or require extra permission before allowing private information to be accessed or read aloud.</p>
<h2><strong>Devices</strong></h2>
<p>Last but not least, don’t assume everyone uses the latest tech on the newest devices. Include older models and humble devices when you design — use responsive design to include smaller sized screens, offer lite versions of your app or simplified versions of your website, and use design that demands minimal battery usage.&nbsp;</p>
<p>After all, lighter works for everyone including those with the newest tech, but heavier may leave out a good bunch.</p>
<h2><strong>We’ve Got More</strong></h2>
<p>This barely scratches the surface on accessibility, but if you’re interested in more technical breakdowns on design and accessibility, you’re in for a treat — there’s a lot in the works!&nbsp;</p>

Let’s take a look at how communication and decision making evolve as companies grow larger.</p><p>Here’s how many companies begin: <br><img src="https://middle-out.io/images/genghis/2company.png" alt="2 people companies"></p><p>Two founders, working closely to get their new startup off the ground.</p><p>A more mature company might look more like this:<br><img src="https://middle-out.io/images/genghis/k3company.png" alt="Small company"></p><p>That’s Google circa 1999. Individuals hold increasingly defined roles. Management and process are beginning to creep in, but all anyone really wants to do is get on with things, management be damned. Grabbing a colleague to discuss something is as easy as shouting across the office.</p><p>But as companies grow larger, the majority end up looking more like this:<img src="https://middle-out.io/images/genghis/3comp.png" alt="Large company"></p><p>This is of course an over-simplification as every organization maintains informal networks, cross-functional teams, and parallel networks. But it is a useful representation to understand how hierarchies simplify the sharing of information by creating highways for it. Additionally, we will assume that every team operates in a mesh (even if we were not skilled enough to draw those relations).</p><p>See those ‘o’ nodes? That’s middle management. Layers and layers of it. Its main purpose is to simplify decision making and communication by concentrating ownership of different parts of the business in the hands of a select few.</p><figure><d-figure id="boldify"><div svelte-1667065745=""><p>For the more mathematically inclined, middle management splits the previously shown complete graphs with <span><span><span><math><semantics><mrow><msub><mi>K</mi><mi>n</mi></msub><mo>=</mo><mfrac><mrow><mi>n</mi><mo>(</mo><mi>n</mi><mo>−</mo><mn>1</mn><mo>)</mo></mrow><mrow><mn>2</mn></mrow></mfrac></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">K_n = \frac{n(n-1)}{2}</annotation></semantics></math></span></span></span> edges into multiple complete subgraphs with <span><span><span><math><semantics><mrow><msub><mi>M</mi><mi>n</mi></msub><mo>=</mo><msubsup><mo>∑</mo><mi>i</mi><mi>n</mi></msubsup><msub><mi>K</mi><mrow><mi>m</mi><mo>(</mo><mi>i</mi><mo>)</mo><mo>+</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow></msub></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">M_n = \sum_i^nK_{m(i)+1}</annotation></semantics></math></span></span></span> edges, where <span><span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>i</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">i</annotation></semantics></math></span></span></span> runs over managers and <span><span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>m</mi><mo>(</mo><mi>i</mi><mo>)</mo></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">m(i)</annotation></semantics></math></span></span></span> is the number of people they manage. We assume that reporting edges correspond to lines of communication and that members of a team are fully connected in complete graphs.</p></div></d-figure></figure><p>The benefits are clear. When CEO Genghis or Kublai, another middle manager, want to figure out what’s going on with the Foobar team (highlighted above in Millenial pink), all they need do is call Subotai. By concentrating ownership of Foobar in Subotai’s hands, his team is shielded from unnecessary communication, allowing them to focus on their work.</p><figure><d-figure id="boldify"><div svelte-1667065745=""><p>To illustrate: <span><span><span><math><semantics><mrow><msub><mi>K</mi><mrow><mn>5</mn><mn>0</mn><mn>0</mn><mn>0</mn></mrow></msub><mo>=</mo><mn>1</mn><mn>2</mn><mo separator="true">,</mo><mn>4</mn><mn>9</mn><mn>7</mn><mo separator="true">,</mo><mn>5</mn><mn>0</mn><mn>0</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">K_{5000} = 12,497,500</annotation></semantics></math></span></span></span>, but introducing 556 managers<sup>1</sup> each with <span><span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>m</mi><mo>(</mo><mi>i</mi><mo>)</mo><mo>=</mo><mn>1</mn><mn>0</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">m(i) = 10</annotation></semantics></math></span></span></span> reports gives <span><span><span><math><semantics><mrow><msub><mi>M</mi><mrow><mn>5</mn><mn>5</mn><mn>6</mn></mrow></msub><mo>=</mo><mn>3</mn><mn>0</mn><mo separator="true">,</mo><mn>5</mn><mn>8</mn><mn>0</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">M_{556} = 30,580</annotation></semantics></math></span></span></span>.

While the ‘x’ nodes focus on the work at hand, the ‘o’ nodes are busy talking and aligning amongst themselves. This creates two problems: the ‘o’s lose touch with the actual work being done, while the ‘x’s cannot easily see, communicate, or influence beyond team boundaries. Which, remember, is why you’ll be surprised when Beezlyboo lands on your desk in two weeks' time.</p><h3>What Companies Are Doing About This Today</h3><p>So far we've been talking about idealized companies. In reality, there are informal networks that permeate company hierarchies. There are also good and bad ‘x’s and ‘o’s. We know a lot about what a good ‘o’ is (or should be). There’s an <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/vickyvalet/2019/03/19/americas-best-management-consulting-firms-2019/#656906003d00">entire industry out there dedicated to this</a>, complete with degrees (MBAs) and reading material (those management books you tend to find in airport bookshops).</p><p>One thing ‘o’s obsess over is how best to organize things, which is great. That's their job, after all. The problem is that their solutions are often clunky. Do any of these sound familiar?</p><ul><li><b>Culture stuff:</b> the ‘o’s realize the company’s formal and informal hierarchies are too strong, so they begin promoting things like guilds, societies, team building activities, random coffee catchups between senior leads and juniors, etc.</li><li><b>Reorgs:</b> featuring endless tweaks to the traditional hierarchical org structure (functional, divisional, matrix/cross-functional… you name it). Ironically, it’s the ‘o’s that instigate these —  often to the complete bewilderment of the ‘x’s.</li><li><b>Surveys:</b> because making the ‘x’s click through an annoying ten-page annual survey is a great way of discovering how they really feel. Right? Right. </li></ul><p>If these solutions sound drab and disengaging, it's because they are. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Coase">Ronald Coase</a>, the 1991 Nobel laureate in economics, published an <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1468-0335.1937.tb00002.x">influential essay in 1937</a> on why firms even appear, and mentions that the benefits of larger firms are quickly outweighed by the overheads of maintaining their complex hierarchies and the misallocations of resources which stem from this. In a more modern work, Gary Hammel and Michele Zanini demonstrate in <a href="https://www.humanocracy.com/">Humanocracy</a> -- another one of those airport books -- that:                </p><p>A <a href="https://www.gallup.com/workplace/236552/managers-engaged-jobs.aspx">2018 Gallup study</a> found two-thirds of US employees and 51 percent of US managers to be disengaged at work.</p><p>In 2018, there were 146 million employees in the US workforce. [...] Of these, 20.5 million were managers and supervisors. In addition, there were 6.4 million employed in administrative support functions. In total, then, the bureaucratic class comprises 26.9 million individuals or 18.4 percent of the US workforce. [...] claiming more than $3.2 trillion in compensation, or nearly a third of America’s total wage bill.</p><p>They argue that, if we could repurpose a fraction of this managerial bloat into more productive pursuits, we would free up a lot of unproductive excess wages and therefore raise productivity, overall compensation (for the rest of us), and employee engagement.</p><p><b>Genghis:</b> Okay, kiddo, that's great... but we're trying to run a Khanate company that stretches from eastern Europe to China. Maybe our team building activities are a little boring, and we do like a good reorg, especially after we invade acquire a new company, but what are you proposing? That we fire all our generals and officers and turn into those Valve hippies? <br><b>Ogedei (You):</b> Not at all. Hear me out.</p><h3>What the Future Might Look Like</h3><p>With everyone and <a href="https://www.itv.com/news/wales/2020-03-19/people-stuck-at-home-are-sharing-pictures-of-their-cat-and-dog-coworkers">their cat</a> — not to mention the <a href="https://www.oecd.org/future-of-work/">OECD</a> — talking about the Future of Work these days, isn’t it time we began trying to tackle company organization with more pizazz? You know, just throw some tech and AI at it.</p><p><b>Genghis:</b> Oh god, here we go again with your AI thing.<br></p><p>He's right: here we go.<sup>2</sup> One of the most significant transformations due to play out over the next decade is the <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/06/20/slack-ceo-predicts-end-of-company-email-as-we-know-it-in-7-years.html">death of email</a> in within-company communications and its replacement by tools like Slack and Teams. Not only do Slack and Teams introduce a new medium for companies to communicate in, they also allow for modern third-party integrations via their APIs. That’s something email tools like Gmail or Outlook never quite got right.</p><p>On top of this, there's an unfolding generational shift. Millennials will continue to graduate to positions of power as the 2020s progress — and they’ve grown up using online chat protocols and social networks.</p><p><b>Ogedei:</b> So here’s the thing, Dad. The way we organize ourselves in companies will change because young people like me communicate in new and different ways.</p><p>The first wave of startups attempting to tackle this — like <a href="https://knowyourteam.com/">Know Your Team (KYT)</a>, <a href="https://www.ally.io/">Ally</a>, <a href="https://lattice.com/">Lattice</a>, <a href="https://www.donut.com/">Donut</a>, <a href="https://withcadence.io/">Cadence</a>, and a handful of others — are already well on their way.</p><p>Let's take KYT as an example. It's a fantastic tool that takes the magic of being a good 'o' and pours it into a suite of effective communication tools to help you manage your reports. Backed by years of research and a kick-ass CEO in <a href="https://clairelew.com/">Claire Lew</a>, KYT is a great example of a company pushing the envelope of how we think about management.</p><figure><d-figure id="boldify"><div svelte-1667065745=""><div><p>If middle managers in today’s corporations are obsessed with airport books and ways of organizing people, then the true organizational geeks are military commanders and theorists. Organizing militaries has been a thing since time immemorial, from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun_Tzu">Sun Tzu</a> to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_von_Clausewitz">Clausewitz</a>.<sup>3</sup></p><p>The Mongols weren’t too shabby either. Instead of Slack, they used a system of postal relays called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yam_(route)">Yam</a>. Instead of executive councils, they had <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurultai">Kurultais</a>. The Mongols adapted quickly and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion_in_the_Mongol_Empire">didn't try to change the religious habits of conquered populations</a>. By virtue of necessity, they also had a <a href="https://www.britannica.com/place/Mongol-empire/Organization-of-Genghis-Khans-empire">pretty devolved leadership structure</a> — individual Khans ruled parts of the empire which were thousands of miles apart. We could learn a lot about how management can be done better from the Mongols.<sup>4</sup></p></div></div></d-figure></figure><h3>Rethinking How We Organize</h3><p>So if fully connected graphs don't scale, and if tight hierarchies are inefficient and soul-crushing, what else is there?</p><p>Say you're a middle manager. You report to someone, a few others report to you. A good chunk of your time is spent synthesizing information (mostly updates) flowing across your node in the graph, from the top down and from the bottom up. </p><p>This is where we come in. At Middle Out, we're working on a solution that analyses user conversations, summarizes important segments into updates, and proposes these updates to users for final editing and approval before making them visible to the rest of the company. We then take these updates and show each user the ones our model believes are most useful to them. This is tantamount to getting rid of the fog-of-war that shrouds parts of any company from individual employees. In short, you'd see Beezlyboo coming a mile away. </p><figure><d-figure id="boldify"><div svelte-1667065745=""><div><p>Why did this not exist before? Why do people still update each other …</p></div></div></d-figure></figure></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <p>Today, I’ve finally decided to fix a bug I’ve been seeing for a long time,
which I always would leave for later as it was a minor bug. This bug is called
FOUC or Flash of Unpainted Content, so I decided to share with you these
2 solutions to this simple problem.</p>
<p>The problem is relatively simple, avoid showing unstyled HTML elements
scattered through the page while the CSS file is being loaded.</p>
<p>There are 2 solutions to this problem, a longer one and a quicker one, you
decide which one works best for you.</p>

<h2 id="solution-1">Solution 1:</h2>
<p>This solution is more complicated to implement but much better. The idea is to
extract critical CSS from the file and inline in the head. By saying critical
I mean all the styles of the above-the-fold content visible on the page load.</p>
<p>This technique will make the page instantly interactable without showing
unstyled elements, while the rest of the CSS file will load in async without
blocking.</p>
<p>There are a few NPM plugins to achieve this without going manually over files,
like <a href="https://github.com/addyosmani/critical">Critical</a>, <a href="https://github.com/filamentgroup/criticalCSS">CriticalCSS</a>…</p>
<h2 id="solution-2">Solution 2:</h2>
<p>A quicker solution would be hiding the HTML element while the CSS file is being
loaded. This not-so-great solution would make the time-to-interactivity longer,
but it will avoid showing unstyled elements.</p>
<p>By placing this CSS rule in the head of the HTML file, we will hide the page:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="html">&lt;<span>style</span>&gt;
  <span>html</span> {
    <span>transform</span>: <span>tanslateX</span>(<span>-100</span><span>%</span>);
  }
&lt;/<span>style</span>&gt;</code></pre></div>
<p>Then, in the CSS file, we’ll set the position to 0, which when loaded will
automatically reset the position previously set in the head:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="css"><span>html</span> {
  <span>transform</span>: translateX(<span>0</span>) <span>!important</span>;
}</code></pre></div>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Depending on the structure, urgency, and importance of the project you can
always consider one of the two solutions.</p>

October 24, 2020 | https://applieddivinitystudies.com/2020/10/15/bus-factor/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://applieddivinitystudies.com/2020/10/15/bus-factor/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
       <p>A friend at a prominent tech company took last month off using their new covid policy. When he got back to work last week, he was horrified. Not to see that things had fallen apart in his absence, but to realize that they hadn’t. Overwhelmingly, life without him had continued as normal.</p>
<p>This is not a coincidence. A company dependent on a single person’s work has a single point of failure. In tech jargon, they have low Bus Factor, the number of people who would have to get hit by a bus for the project to fail. The higher your Bus Factor, the greater your institutional resilience.</p>
<p>But it’s hard to reconcile this experience with faith in an impactful career. If a firing squad executes a prisoner, we can say that each shooter is sufficient but not necessary. The success of the project depends on the shooters in aggregate, but not on any person in particular.</p>
<p>It’s easy to understand why an organization might want this kind of redundancy. Sure, it’s wasteful and inefficient, but it prevents the greatest threat to any company: giving employees leverage.</p>
<h3 id="The-Misery-of-Redundancy"><a href="#The-Misery-of-Redundancy" title="The Misery of Redundancy"></a>The Misery of Redundancy</h3><p>If you’re reading this, you’re probably well versed on sublinear returns to headcount. You know about the Mythical Man-Month, and understand that communication scales quadratically. You shudder at the thought of growing complexity.</p>
<p>But the untold story isn’t about efficiency, it’s about negative returns to engagement. One person on a project is personally responsible. Two people might manage to coordinate. Beyond that, you’re in the endless hellscape of team projects.</p>
<p>Remember the last time you were assigned partners in school? A team project is a game of chicken. Each participant signals their willingness to fail through procrastination, until finally at the last minute someone defects and does all the work. The more you care, the more you lose.</p>
<p>(At least those projects ended. As a friend once put it, the weirdest thing about working at large companies is that you’ll wake up one morning, have a new teammate randomly assigned to you, and proceed to see them 8 hours a day every day until one of you quits or dies.)</p>
<p>This is the world of high Bus Factor. The greater a project’s supposed “resilience”, the more each person becomes dispensable. Sufficient, but not necessary.</p>
<p>(Even if you’re working in a mission-driven company, your job is meaningless unless you’re personally responsible for the success of that mission. The US Government might be the single more important organization in the world. How do you think it feels to work as an entry level bureaucrat?)</p>
<p>Have you ever wondered why you spend so much time writing design docs and detailed PRs? Or why you’re constantly stuck in meetings explaining what you do to various groups of people? Or why your project has a separate engineer, EM, PM, Designer and Tech Lead? Maybe these are best practices, maybe we’ve all settled on the right way of doing things.</p>
<p>But they’re also ways of making sure that if you get hit by a bus, no one has to care.</p>
<h3 id="Self-Reinforcing-Churn"><a href="#Self-Reinforcing-Churn" title="Self-Reinforcing Churn"></a>Self-Reinforcing Churn</h3><p>Every large tech company runs performance reviews twice a year. Don’t ask me why, it’s the way things have always been done.</p>
<p>Simultaneously, the average tenure at these companies hovers at around 2 years.</p>
<p>That means that at any given point, fully one quarter of your teammates are totally checked out.</p>
<p>On the high end, there are people who know they’re leaving in the next year, and just have absolutely no reason to care. If you’re at the beginning of a new review cycle, you’re 6 months away from getting PIP’d, which means you’re 12 months away from getting fired.</p>
<p>Odds are, you’re going to lose the game of chicken. You might not have the most to lose, but unless you’re also quitting next cycle, you certainly don’t have the least.</p>
<p>For the employer, the upshot is that anyone can quit at any time. If you’re on a 12 person team, you might lose 3 people each half. The only viable response is to up the Bus Factor, layer on more redundancy, and limit the importance of each individual.</p>
<p>Of course, the irony is that it’s precisely this sense of replaceability that drives churn in the first place! The more employees are alienated, the more willing they are to leave as soon as their equity vests.</p>
<p>So this ends up being a vicious cycle where higher churn forces a higher Bus Factor, which causes alienation, which increases churn, and so on until you either die or become Oracle.</p>
<h3 id="Escaping-the-Labyrinth"><a href="#Escaping-the-Labyrinth" title="Escaping the Labyrinth"></a>Escaping the Labyrinth</h3><p>The flip side is that there’s still hope.</p>
<p>Since the cycle is self-reinforcing, we can break it in the middle and slay the ouroboros. There’s historical path dependence, but no fundamental reason we have to live this way.</p>
<p>The alternative to redundancy isn’t fragility, it’s personal responsibility. It’s keeping your Bus Factor low.</p>
<p>In this world, you can develop specific mastery instead of a broad assortment of skills. You can be a craftsman instead of a code monkey, understand systems deeply instead of cargo culting best practices.</p>
<p>Imagine working at a company where every single one of your coworkers gives a shit. Imagine knowing that your contributions are important, that the world is different because of your existence.</p>
<p>That’s Bus Factor 1.</p>
<p>As far as I can tell, this is basically how SpaceX works. It’s not a coincidence that they’re <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.payscale.com/data-packages/top-tech-companies-compared">ranked #1 for both stress and sense of meaning</a>. If you hear that employees are overworked and underpaid, don’t cry abuse, ask how they’re getting compensated instead.</p>
<h3 id="FAQ"><a href="#FAQ" title="FAQ"></a>FAQ</h3><p><strong>Why exactly does leverage even matter?</strong><br><em>A priori</em>, it shouldn’t. If all employees have leverage, there’s nothing to negotiate for. You could ask for more money, but everyone else could too, eventually the company falls apart and you all lose.</p>
<p>But <em>a posteriori</em>, we can work backwards from behavior. If companies are willing to sacrifice efficiency, that is itself evidence of exploitation.</p>
<p><strong>That sounds crazy. If engineers are actually underpaid, why don’t they just go somewhere else? Why doesn’t the market raise salaries?</strong><br>I’ve screened resumes from entry level engineers who claim to have saved their companies millions of dollars. The crazy part is that I believe it! If you can make even the smallest change to a ranking algorithm, or improve the performance of a costly computation, or run an experiment that marginally increases click-through rate, the effects multiply out across a huge user base.</p>
<p>And yet, I don’t know a single entry level engineer getting paid commensurately.</p>
<p>First, there’s a lack of counterfactual impact. Sure, you saved the company a million dollars, but if you didn’t take the job someone else would, and they would have done the same work.</p>
<p>Your impact looks huge, but in a high Bus Factor world, your actual impact is just the delta between your ability and the next best engineer. You might be able to negotiate another $10k, but not two orders of magnitude more.</p>
<p>Second, you don’t own the means of production. Your skills are only worth millions of dollars in the particular context of this company. You can’t walk away and produce that value on your own. You depend on the company much more than it depends on you.</p>
<p><strong>Hmm, maybe, but if firms have so much market power, why don’t they just keep Bus Factor low but set a strong precedent against adversarial negotiation?</strong><br>Great question. Since companies are good at internal coordination, and employees are bad at collective bargaining, firms ought to be able to keep salaries low even without increasing the Bus Factor.</p>
<p>You could just wait for someone to speak up, immediately fire them, take whatever financial hit comes from their project’s failure, but set the precedent for any future dissidents that negotiation is unacceptable.</p>
<p>The problem is, firms don’t handle negotiations, managers do, and their incentives are just as screwed up as yours. A manager stands to lose their career if too many projects fail, but it costs them nothing to advocate for your promotion. So in a low Bus Factor world, the tendency is always to default to generosity.</p>
<p>Why doesn’t this happen at SpaceX? Remember, none of this is actually about salaries or promotions, it’s about sociopathically pursuing leverage as an alternative to fulfilment when you have no other choices. This is all conditional on not being treated like a human, and not having a meaningful job.</p>
<p>In Bus Factor 1 world, you have too much personal responsibility to coast on momentum or free ride on a teammate’s accomplishments. More importantly, you might actually personally care.</p>
<p><strong>Wouldn’t running a company as Bus Factor 1 invite risk?</strong><br>Absolutely. SpaceX has blown up rockets. Tesla has missed deadlines. Neuralink is doing god knows what.</p>
<p>But management science, financial engineering and organizational design are filled with countless other methods for deferring risk.</p>
<p><strong>Okay fine, I’m sold, where do I sign up?</strong><br>Pretty much nowhere!</p>
<p>I’ve asked every friend, accepted every cold call from recruiters, and as far as I can tell, nearly no companies or even individual teams are run with Bus Factor 1. Again, maybe SpaceX, but I’m relaying that second hand.</p>
<p>If you find out, let me know. Or better yet, start it yourself and tell me!</p>

	<div>
		
<p>Another day, another HackerNews discussion about hiring being broken. The most recent one I saw was triggered by <a href="https://blog.alinelerner.com/ive-been-an-engineer-and-a-recruiter-hiring-is-broken-heres-why-and-heres-what-it-should-be-like-instead/">a blog post</a> by the formidable Aline Lerner (disclaimer: Aline is a friend and we collaborated on a <a href="https://www.holloway.com/g/technical-recruiting-hiring/about">hiring book</a> last year). Now, I 100% agree that hiring is broken, and Aline’s post is really thoughtful. In fact, a lot of “hiring is broken” articles are thoughtful.</p>



<p>But the discussion threads are something else—they miss the point of the article. The discussion threads are even more broken than hiring. And they’re really repetitive. They always do contain grains of truth, but inevitably have us reaching conclusions that are simplistic, and in my opinion, create a pretty bad attitude in the tech industry.</p>



<p><strong>Conclusion #1: “Hiring sucks for candidates, but hiring managers can do what they want</strong>“</p>



<p>The truth is that hiring is hard for everyone. There’s no question about it. It’s hard for both candidates and for hiring managers. Sure, FAANGs and the startup-du-jour might have a leg up, but most people who are hiring are trying to hire at a non-FAANG, non-sexy company. If you’ve never done it, you should try it at some point in your career. It’s an <em>incredibly </em>humbling experience. Or, at the very least, find a friend who’s spent time on hiring, and ask them for their favorite battle story.</p>



<p>And yes, on the balance, power and information asymmetry work out in favor of the companies hiring. And that asymmetry is much larger with FAANGs. But even FAANGs have to invest a tremendous amount of time and energy into hiring. It’s not really easy for anyone. </p>



<p>Especially if you want to do it <em>well</em>. Ask any successful leader (entrepreneur, manager) what they spend most of their time on, and it’ll either involve a large chunk spent on hiring (if they appreciate the problem and give it the attention it deserves) or dealing with the consequences of bad hiring (if they don’t).</p>



<p><strong>Conclusion #2: “Hiring is a crap-shoot—it’s a roll of the dice</strong>“</p>



<p>I strongly disagree with this one. When writing the <a href="https://www.holloway.com/g/technical-recruiting-hiring">Holloway Guide to Technical Hiring and Recruiting</a>, I got to interview dozens of really thoughtful hiring managers and recruiters. They were really good at their jobs. And there were some common themes. They were thoughtful about every step of their process. They kept their process balanced and fair, holding a high bar but respecting candidates and their time. They didn’t chase the same pool of candidates everyone else was chasing—instead, they found non-traditional ways to discover really talented and motivated people who weren’t in the pool of usual suspects. They were thoughtful about what signals they were looking for and how best to assess them. And, they deeply understood their team’s needs, and candidates’ needs, and were really good at deciding when there was or wasn’t a fit. But most of all, they were effective: they built really talented teams.</p>



<p>There are a handful of companies that have built amazing hiring engines, and the proof is that they’ve been able to put together really strong teams. You can generally tell that if a person worked at a certain company at a certain time, that person is probably incredibly intelligent and incredibly motivated (some examples are Google, Facebook, Stripe, Dropbox at different points in time). There will always be noise. Even the best hiring managers will sometimes make hiring mistakes. And of course, even the best engineers may not be a fit for every role or every company. </p>



<p>Again, hiring is hard. But there is not a shred of doubt in my mind that if you are thoughtful about it, you can hire well. And really, you don’t need to be perfect at it. You just need to be better than the rest.</p>



<p><strong>Conclusion #3: “FAANGs suck at hiring”</strong></p>



<p>This one has some truth to it, but it’s a lot more subtle than “FAANGs suck at hiring”. Because let’s face it, they do hire really smart people. Some of the smartest people I know are at FAANGs right now. So let’s decouple that statement a little more.</p>



<p>FAANGs <em>do </em>suck at parts of hiring, like their candidate experience. They can be really slow at making hiring decisions. Their hiring process might be tedious and seem arbitrary. But <em>they usually can get away with it</em>, <em>and you probably can’t!</em> They’ve got a strong brand, interesting technical challenges (interesting for some people, at least), and a lot of money. In fact, one FAANG VP of Engineering told me: “our process is what we can get away with”. To the point that they can even play it off as a positive: “our process is slow and long because we are <em>very</em> selective”.</p>



<p>And look, I’m sure FAANGs lose some talented candidates who get turned off by their “you’d-be-blessed-to-work-with-us” attitude. They definitely have a lot of room for improvement. But at the end of the day, they’re operating a process that’s delivering large quantities of really smart people at scale. In fact, I’d argue their internal processes around strategy, performance management / promotions, etc cause incredibly <em>more</em> damage to them than broken hiring—if you lose out on hiring one talented person when you have thousands applying to work for you, that’s one story, but if you hire someone really talented and driven, and they work for you for 6 to 12 months but don’t meet their potential and leave in bitter frustration… well, that’s a subject for another post)</p>



<p>“But”, people go on, “FAANGs <em>also</em> don’t know how to interview!” Which brings me to trope #4.</p>



<p><strong>Conclusion #4: “Whiteboard</strong> <strong>and algo/coding interviews suck”</strong></p>



<p>Again, this one has some truth to it, but if you just stop at the above statement, you miss the point.</p>



<p>Algo/coding interviews are one of the primary hiring mechanisms used by FAANG companies. And they are incredibly unpopular—at least in discussion threads. But big companies have spent years looking at their hiring data and feeding that back into their hiring process (coining the term “<a href="https://rework.withgoogle.com/subjects/people-analytics/">people analytics</a>” along the way).</p>



<p>The argument against them is usually a combination of:</p>



<ul><li>they really only assess pattern-matching skills (map a problem to something you’ve seen before)</li><li>they only assess willingness to spend time preparing for these types of interviews</li></ul>



<p>These are fair criticisms, but that doesn’t mean these interviews are actually terrible. I mean, they might be terrible for you if you’re interviewing and you don’t get the job. You’re probably a brilliant engineer, and I agree, these interviews certainly don’t fully assess your ability (or maybe you’re a shit engineer, I don’t know you personally). In any case, the leap from “this interview sucked for me” to “this interview sucks” is still pretty big.</p>



<p>If you’re a large tech co with a big brand and a salary scale that ranks at the top of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.levels.fyi/">Levels.fyi</a>, you probably get a lot of applications. So a good interview process is one that weeds out people who wouldn’t do well at your company. To do well at a large tech company, you need to (and I’m painting with a really broad brush, but this is true for 90% of roles at these companies):</p>



<ol><li>Some sort of problem-solving skill that’s a mix of raw intelligence and/or ability to solve problems by pattern-matching to things you’ve seen before.</li><li>Ability/commitment to work on something that may not&nbsp;<em>always&nbsp;</em>be that intrinsically motivating, in the context of getting/maintaining a well-paying job at a large, known company.</li></ol>



<p>Hopefully you can see where I’m going with this. Basically, the very criticisms thrown at these types of interviews are the reason they work well for these companies. They’re a good proxy for the work you’d be doing there and how willing you are to do it. If you’re good at pattern matching, and are willing to invest effort into practicing to get one of these jobs, you’ll probably do well at the job.</p>



<p>Not that there’s anything wrong with that type of work. I spent several years at big tech co’s, and the work was intellectually stimulating most of the time. But a lot of times it wasn’t. It was a lot of pattern-matching. Looking at how someone else had solved a problem in a different part of the code-base, and adapting that to my use-case.</p>



<p>On the other hand, if you’re a brilliant engineer who struggles with being told what to do or doing work that you can’t immediately connect to something intrinsically motivating to you, that FAANG interview just did both you and the company a favor by weeding you out of the process.</p>



<p>So the truth is, there is no single “best interview technique”. In our book, we wrote several chapters about different interviewing techniques and their pros and cons. In-person algo/coding interviews on a whiteboard, in-person interviews where you work in an existing code base, <a href="https://www.holloway.com/g/technical-recruiting-hiring/sections/take-homes">take-home interviews</a>, pairing together, having a trial period, etc all have pros and cons. The trick is finding a technique that works for both the company and the candidate. </p>



<p>And that can really differ from company to company and candidate to candidate. A VP at Netflix told me about how they had a really strong candidate come in, but when asked to do a whiteboard-type interview, informed them (politely) that they might as well just reject him then. He was no good at whiteboard interviews… But if they allowed him to go home and write some code, he’d be happy to talk through it. And since then, many Netflix teams have offered candidates the choice of doing a take home.</p>



<p>And really, any interview format can suck. It can fail to assess a candidate for the things a company needs and it can be a negative candidate experience. Which would you rather have:</p>



<ul><li>A whiteboard interview with heavy algorithms for a role where that knowledge (or ability to develop that knowledge) isn’t critical, delivered by an apathetic engineer who doesn’t care about their job.</li><li>A poorly-designed take-home, requiring skills that you don’t have and won’t need for the job, and that you spend hours thinking through and working on, send in, and get rejected without getting any feedback.</li></ul>



<p>Probably neither.</p>



<p><strong>So …</strong></p></div></article></main></section></div></div>

For example, I clone my <a href="https://github.com/jappeace/haskell-template-project">haskell template project</a>, edit the names, edit the <code>readme</code> end re-setup the&nbsp;remotes:</p><div><pre><span></span>git remote add template git@github.com:jappeace/haskell-template-project.git
git remote set-url origin git@github.com:jappeace/new-project.git
</pre></div><p>This allows me to keep my downstream project up to date with the template. When I discover another tool, this can be merged into the downstream project for example. It allows evolving the template over time as I learn more about whatever programming language I’m&nbsp;using.</p><p>It also gives me default branding. Which makes it look more ‘professional’. Although I don’t like branding, I know this is necessary. Having it there by default makes it so that I don’t forget to do&nbsp;this.</p><p>When starting a project you also gain some free authoritativeness, because you have a longer commit history the project looks like it is more mature. Although this practice is a little deceptive, there is a core of truth, because the template has gotten a lot of attention. If you feel offended by this practice, ask yourself first, why are you trusting git histories? These can be <a href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Rewriting-History">rewritten anyway</a>. This authoritativeness also gives me a small moral boost. It just <em>feels</em> better to have a project with well thought out tools being started and some history rather then the ‘normal’ stuff everyone starts&nbsp;with.</p><h2 id="alternatives">Alternatives</h2><p>The alternatives are using tools that spit out templates. In the haskell world these are <a href="https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stack-templates">stack new</a>, <a href="https://cabal.readthedocs.io/en/latest/developing-packages.html#using-cabal-init">cabal init</a> or <a href="https://github.com/kowainik/summoner">summoner</a>. These tools are simply a glorified <code>sed</code> on projects folders: They find and replace variables. There is no versioning, there is no personalization except what limited variables&nbsp;give.</p><p>Because these tools don’t take into account history, the first commit will be a large commit with a message like ‘Initial’. I find this problematic because it squashes all the work that went into creating the template. Information is lost, for no&nbsp;reason.</p><p>These tools don’t use git to track their templates. They could, but they don’t. Maybe they wanted to be <span>VCS</span><sup id="fnref-1"><a href="#fn-1">2</a></sup> agnostic? I’m speculating, but even if you wanted to be that, you could still use any version system to track the template and recreate the history in the <span>VCS</span> desired by the user. This at least gives the user their history of the template back. While also giving them the choice of <span>VCS</span><sup id="fnref-8"><a href="#fn-8">3</a></sup></p><h2 id="a-template-hierarchy">A template&nbsp;hierarchy</h2><p>What I described in the intro can be taken a step further. A template of a template can be used to create another new template. For example, say you’re a fan of <a href="https://nixos.org/">nix</a> or <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html">make</a>, so why not put a makefile and a <a href="https://nix.dev/tutorials/towards-reproducibility-pinning-nixpkgs.html#pinning-nixpkgs">nix pin</a> in some template of templates project. These tools don’t care about which language you use, so their configuration can be shared among Python, Java and Haskell projects for example. Maybe for github it could even have a partial travis or github actions <span>CI</span>&nbsp;setup.</p><p>Now, say you’re starting a new Python project, but have no template yet for that programming language. You simply clone this template of templates and customize it to your own <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/25011078/what-does-pythonic-mean#:~:text=Pythonic%20means%20code%20that%20doesn,is%20intended%20to%20be%20used.">Pythonic</a> needs. You can still pull in the upstream changes from your template of templates, for example to upgrade the nix pin. The big advantage of course is that a change in the template of templates can easily merged into all downstream projects with&nbsp;git.</p><p>I convinced the reader that using git is the superior way for template management. It’s simpler, and more flexible. I also convinced the authors of stack, cabal and summoner to drop their current way of managing templates and use git&nbsp;instead.</p><p>Or, more likely, no-one read this&nbsp;far.</p></div><small></small></article><section></section><section></section></div></div>]]>

October 24, 2020 | https://www.jakeworth.com/how-i-talk/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.jakeworth.com/how-i-talk/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I’ve been giving technical talks for a few years; I keep a list of each one
<a href="https://www.jakeworth.com/about/">here</a>. Speaking makes me nervous, and it’s a major time investment if
I’m doing it right. But it’s worth the effort, because it’s fueled my growth as
a developer.</p>
<p>I’m speaking at the Vim Chicago Meetup next month about integrating React.js
with Vim, and I’d like to use that as an excuse to write about my speaking
preparation process.</p>
<p>Some smart people have written on these subjects, and anything I’d have to say
leverages these ideas:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.noelrappin.com/railsrx/2014/1/18/conference-prompts-or-how-to-submit-proposals-and-influence-people">Conference Prompts: Or How to Submit Proposals and Influence People</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.inc.com/geoffrey-james/how-to-fix-your-presentations-21-tips.html">Fix Your Presentations: 21 Quick Tips</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.deconstructconf.com/blog/how-to-prepare-a-talk">How to Prepare a Talk</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.railstips.org/blog/archives/2010/05/05/improve-your-presentations-in-under-50/">Improve Your Presentations In Under $50</a></li>
<li><a href="http://speaking.io/">Speaking.io</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.noelrappin.com/railsrx/2014/3/17/what-i-learned-from-reading-429-conference-proposals">What I learned from reading 429 conference proposals</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.sarahmei.com/blog/2014/04/07/what-your-conference-proposal-is-missing">What Your Conference Proposal Is Missing</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Several of these writers talk about submitting conference proposals, AKA CFPs.
I don’t plan to cover that in depth. Why not? Because I don’t really know how
it works. I submitted more than a few proposals before getting accepted to
speak at my first conference, <a href="http://confreaks.tv/videos/railsconf2017-observing-chance-a-gold-master-test-in-practice">RailsConf 2017</a>. I believe once you
can write a compelling proposal, there is a significant element of luck to the
process. So, submit many proposals, and be like Thomas Jefferson, who one said:
“I’m a great believer in luck, and I find the harder I work the more I have of
it.”</p>
<p>I break my speaking process into four phases:</p>
<ol>
<li>Finding an idea</li>
<li>Brainstorming</li>
<li>Researching and preparing slides</li>
<li>Practice and Delivery</li>
</ol>
<p>I can’t claim these steps as essential; they just help me. My target reader is
somebody who wants to speak and has never done so before. I want you to walk
away with encouragement and a step-by-step, jargon-free checklist for preparing
a technical talk.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Finding an idea</h3>
<p>Talks are entertainment, and with the right passion, familiarity, and
freshness, I hope to produce something worth listening to.</p>
<p>Here’s a great primer on why you, reader, have valuable ideas:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.noelrappin.com/railsrx/2014/1/18/conference-prompts-or-how-to-submit-proposals-and-influence-people">Conference Prompts: Or How to Submit Proposals and Influence People</a></li>
</ul>
<p>What ideas lead to great talks? My strongest talks share the following traits:</p>
<ol>
<li>I’m passionate about the idea</li>
<li>I know the subject well enough to master it in the allotted time</li>
<li>I’ve practiced the subject in the recent past</li>
</ol>
<p>To lend context, I’ll take a case study from the talk I’m preparing for next
month’s Vim Chicago and React Chicago Meetups, titled <em>React.js + Vim</em>.</p>
<h4>Passion</h4>
<p>I love Vim. Learning this 25-year-old text editor changed my career. I went
<a href="https://www.jakeworth.com/vim-or-bust">all-in</a> on Vim three years ago and have translated my passion
into organizing the Vim Chicago Meetup.  And, I also love React. React is my
tool of choice for the frontend.</p>
<p>Like any technical ability, writing React code well in Vim exists on a spectrum
ranging from barely-getting-it-done to ninja-flow-state.</p>
<p>It takes work to build your Vim into the perfect React development environment.
Writing React code means that I seek that perfection. What mappings, plugins,
and workflow hacks can I use to get there? It’s a subject that I care about,
and that’s the most important trait of a good talk.</p>
<h4>Familiarity</h4>
<p>An idea that’s explored in <a href="http://speaking.io/">Speaking.io</a> is that aspirational talks,
i.e.– “I want to know about this subject, so I’ll sign up for a talk and learn
it by the deadline”– can backfire. I’ve heard this idea referred to as Talk
Driven Development, and if it works for you, great.</p>
<p>I have to start with a foundation of understanding. I need to already be at
least at the same level of the average listener. Only then do I have a chance
at pushing myself and my listeners, with enough time and work, beyond that
level into unfamiliar ground.</p>
<h4>Freshness</h4>
<p>For passion to translate to an interesting talk, I need to have done the work
recently. When somebody is speaking about an idea that’s fresh in their mind,
the talk is better.</p>
<p>The ideas also have to be relevant to a developer working in the world right
now. In the case of <em>React.js + Vim</em>, the JavaScript ecosystem is constantly
changing, and any techniques I haven’t validated recently will likely be
outdated.</p>
<p>Another benefit of talking about recent completed work is that I’ve had time to
recognize the things I could have done better. I can integrate these lessons
into the talk.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Brainstorming</h3>
<p>Thinking about a subject, while also being a sponge to the world, combined with
an effective system of note-taking, is how I get from an idea to the first
draft of my talks.</p>
<p>Brainstorming is the most important part of the process, because it’s the
foundation for everything that follows. For me it has two parts:</p>
<ol>
<li>Thinking about the subject in an open-minded way, paying attention to ideas
that cross my mind, ideas in the world, and relevant ideas of my colleagues and
friends.</li>
<li>Recording <em>everything</em>.</li>
</ol>
<p>Here’s a little more about each step.</p>
<h4>Thinking</h4>
<p>To prepare a good talk, I generate a lot of ideas.</p>
<p>Stephen King’s <em>On Writing: A Memoir of the Craft</em> contains a useful anecdote.
As a young writer, King faced rejection after rejection. After much failure,
one editor took the time to offer King some advice, writing on his manuscript
“Get rid of 10%.” King removed 10% of the words from his manuscript, began
submitting it again, and soon landed his first publication deal. Cutting 10%,
sometimes again and again, became one of his most valuable tools.</p>
<p>For every idea that makes it into a talk, I’ve rejected five. This slaughter is
possible because I think about a subject for hours in an open-minded way.
Listening to technical news and blog posts and the people around me, reading
code, and writing things down. With this mindset, I cultivate a long list of
ideas which will help me fill out the time.</p>
<p>Leading up to a talk, I like to solicit ideas from my coworkers and the general
programming. I had some great conversations and received many ideas through our
company Slack. Borrowing ideas from others makes your talk stronger against the
inevitable blind spots we all possess.</p>
<p>Here is some of my current brainstorm list for my talk next month. I check off
an idea when I’ve researched it. Stuff that I want to pursue further gets
marked <code>[x]</code>, and the rest gets marked <code>[-]</code>.</p>
<div data-language="markdown"><pre><code><span><span>###</span> Reactjs + Vim Talk Ideas</span>

<span>-</span> [x] Build the talk from a blank virtual box
<span>-</span> [ ] Writing JS in Vim – Alex LaFroscia – Medium
<span>-</span> [ ] Investigate <span>`.eshintrc`</span> settings
<span>-</span> [ ] Go top to bottom through a JSX file and find optimizations
<span>-</span> [ ] Vim nnoremap: <span>`\p — :! prettier %`</span>
<span>-</span> [ ] Technologist often arrive at the same idea independently (PrettierJS)
<span>-</span> [ ] Linting solves needless churn and technical debating
<span>-</span> [ ] Ale plugin
<span>-</span> [ ] CLTab
<span>-</span> [ ] <span>`CTRL X + CTRL L`</span> <span>-</span> tab complete import statements
<span>-</span> [ ] Vim-surround plugin for JSX</code></pre></div>
<p>Most of these ideas aren’t good. But they give me options.</p>
<p>This is a brain exercise, so don’t be tired, distracted, or under any kind of
pressure.</p>
<h4>Record Everything</h4>
<p>I use <a href="http://gettingthingsdone.com/">GTD</a> for taking notes in a physical notebook. Whatever your method,
be sure to capture every one of the great ideas you generate. Without a
rigorous system of note-taking, I would lose a lot of the ideas to simple
forgetfulness.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Researching and Preparing Slides</h3>
<p>Researching and preparing the slides is a unique process and these ideas have
worked for me in the past. Experimenting and automating my process has helped
me to develop talks that are detailed and hopefully interesting to watch.</p>
<h4>Research</h4>
<p>When possible, I start in an unusual place for tech: the library. Libraries
contain a wealth of information on many technical subjects. Connecting a
topical web development subject to the history of computers or human inquiry is
something Sandi Metz, a speaker I admire, does well. Even when the material
isn’t there waiting to be found, there’s always something, as well as
professionals who can help you devise a research strategy.</p>
<p>Technical talks, often mislabeled ‘hard’ talks, are what I prepare most often.
They require experimentation. I use the ideas I found during to try a lot of
experiments in my text editor or REPL. Which are worth explaining?</p>
<h4>Preparing Slides</h4>
<p>After trying PowerPoint, Keynote, and even Vim buffers navigated with <code>]f</code> and
<code>[f</code> (an idea I borrowed from Steve Klabnik; not recommended unless you’re an
unflappable speaker), I discovered <a href="https://www.decksetapp.com/">Deckset</a>.</p>
<p>Deckset is a feature-rich markdown slide builder, and I love it. If you know
markdown, Deckset is fantastic. It lets me crank out ideas and
proofs-of-concept right in my editor. If you feel that the hardest part of
preparing a talk is putting together the visuals and notes you need to speak,
then Deckset is worth trying.</p>
<p>As for slide design, I follow the guidelines put forth in
<a href="http://speaking.io/">Speaking.io</a> and the Chicago Ruby Meetup speaking guidelines. To
summarize:</p>
<ol>
<li>Make your text as big as you can.</li>
<li>Use the most basic code examples that you can.</li>
<li>Use high contrast colors, like black text on a white background. Subtle
palettes like Zenburn don’t work on a projector.</li>
<li>Don’t show code unless you want your audience to read every line; they will.</li>
</ol>
<p>My talks don’t feature funny GIFs, pictures, or video. Why? I don’t trust
myself to be funny, and don’t want to invest any of the time I have to prepare
on that quadrant. It’s a strategy.</p>
<p>I structure my talks like essays, with an introduction, thesis, 3-4 supporting
points, and a conclusion. Formulaic, but it works.</p>
<p>Something I often ponder is: could this be a blog post? One of the less
effective types of presentations could be summarized as a person reading a blog
post they wrote. A telltale sign of such a talk is when the speaker concludes
with a link to a blog post with the same title as the talk. I’ve given a few
like this that I didn’t love. A good talk isn’t a recipe for solving some
narrow problem, it’s a performance that would fall flat on a page.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Practice and Delivery</h3>
<h4>Practice</h4>
<p>Practice is everything. I run through the entire talk without stopping at least
10-20 times prior to any presentation. I do every rehearsal with a visible
timer, standing at a podium, projecting my slides onto something, even just a
television screen, even wearing the type of clothing I’ll be wearing at the
presentation.</p>
<p>I practice setting up my …</p></div></div>

<h3>Sidebar: What is Fluree?</h3>



<p><em>Fluree is an Open-Source Semantic Graph Database that guarantees data integrity, provides traceability into data provenance, facilitates secure data collaboration, and powers connected data insights. Fluree organizes blockchain-secured data in an append-only, immutable ledger. Fluree exposes the ledger data in industry-standard RDF as a semantic graph database. Fluree can run on any machine, and its “edge” query servers can be scaled linearly to meet any level of enterprise demand. Fluree can even run as an in-memory database alongside your code, thanks to our </em><a href="https://flur.ee/javascript-library/"><em>Javascript library and React Frontend capabilities</em></a><em>.</em></p><p><em>Read more about fluree in our documentation </em></p><p><a href="http://docs.flur.ee/"><em>here</em></a><em>.</em></p>

<hr>



<p><br>On the heels of concluding our<a href="https://www.crn.com/news/applications-os/blockchain-startup-fluree-completes-seed-funding-round"> Seed Round</a> fundraise, the Fluree team is now focused on growing an open-source community of technologists passionate about the future of secure, democratic data management.</p>



<div><p>Fluree co-founder Brian Platz and Flip Filipowski have always planned to build the Fluree platform alongside an open-source community. The two established Fluree as a <a href="https://medium.com/fluree/why-fluree-is-a-pbc-public-benefit-corporation-50ab90ca081b">Public Benefit Corporation</a> to use the power of open, trusted data management to solve large-scale problems in our enterprises and society. Many of Fluree’s key use cases today —&nbsp; including Verifiable Credentials, Decentralized Identifiers, Master Data Management, Open Data platforms, and integrations with Public Blockchains — will benefit from an open-source community behind the technology and a rejection of vendor-locked proprietary formatting.&nbsp;</p></div>



<h2><strong>Why Open Source?</strong></h2>



<p>Trust and Accessibility.&nbsp;</p>



<p><em><strong>Trust</strong></em> – Data is becoming an important, dynamic asset for every organization. If enterprises are going to entrust a platform to securely manage this critical asset, it should be open-source and standards-based. Data is too valuable to be locked up in a proprietary format; held hostage by a single private vendor. By open-sourcing Fluree and leveraging W3C standards, you can have confidence that your data is future-proof and portable.</p>



<div><p><em><strong>Accessibility</strong></em> – Fluree is excited to provide its technology to anyone involved in the future of our internet. We are firmly committed to the idea that everyone should have equitable access to this cutting-edge technology.&nbsp;</p></div>



<h2><strong>Why Now?</strong></h2>



<p>Fluree <a href="https://medium.com/fluree/flureedb-is-production-ready-and-live-86bce82665dc">shipped</a> its first production-ready offering in 2018. Over the last two years, we assembled a team of skilled engineers to build out the platform with key <a href="http://flur.ee/features">features</a> and <a href="https://github.com/fluree">open-source libraries</a>, drawing from feedback in our growing developer <a href="https://launchpass.com/flureedb">community</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<div><p>Today, we feel confident in releasing Fluree Version 1.0 to the world — under Open Source —&nbsp; so that we can move our technology forward, together with our community.&nbsp;</p></div>



<h2><strong>What is the difference between the </strong><a href="https://flur.ee/getstarted/"><strong>Open-Source Community Edition</strong></a><strong> and the </strong><a href="https://flur.ee/contact/"><strong>Fluree Enterprise License</strong></a><strong>?&nbsp;</strong></h2>



<p><br>Not much from a technical standpoint. Let us explain:&nbsp;</p>



<p>All of Fluree’s features will be available for general use in our Open-Source version. We figured it wouldn’t make sense to restrict bells and whistles for members of our community that are investing the time to learn and build on our platform.&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>Examples of folks that would build on Fluree’s Open Source Community Edition:</em></p>



<ul><li>You are a university professor or student</li><li>You are a startup building an innovative SaaS or dApp</li><li>You are a developer at an enterprise testing Fluree in a proof of concept phase</li></ul>



<p><em>When you might make the switch to Fluree’s License-Supported Model:</em></p>



<ul><li>You are looking for 24/7 Commerical Support for setup and maintenance </li><li>You are deploying Fluree in a critical production environment that requires Fluree’s “officially-approved” license </li></ul>



<p>Fluree also intends to build out a suite of enterprise solutions around the core product, including tools to manage a Fluree data network and associated dashboards.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong><em>A Third Option: Fluree’s Commercial Cloud</em></strong></p>



<p>Would you like to build, test, deploy, and run Fluree without provisioning your own servers? <a href="https://flur.ee/contact/">Get in touch with sales</a> to chat about our Database as a Service cloud environment.</p>

				Introduction to Data-Centricity			</a>

        <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base64">Base64-encoding</a> is ubiquitous in our
modern world. Many programs communicate in base64-encoded messages, since these
have nice properties: They consist of a very limited subset of ASCII characters,
and can thus be displayed as text. E-Mails for example are commonly encoded in
base64 in transfer, which can be seen in the <code>Content-Transfer-Encoding</code> header.</p>

<p>Where I volunteer we have a tradition of putting <code>changeme</code> as a placeholder for
many template variables indicating that they should be overwritten later. Thus,
if we later still see <code>changeme</code> anywhere we know that somewhere somebody must
have forgotten to specify a variable<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>.</p>

<p>Sometimes these template variables should correspond to base64-encoded content,
i.e. the base64-decoding of said variable should produce meaningful content. But
what happens if somebody forgets to define said variable, and it is substituted
with<code>changeme</code> instead? I always thought that it would fail to
decode the string since the probability that <code>changeme</code> is actually valid base64
encoding must be very low. But lo and behold, this is not the case:</p>

<pre><code>% echo changeme | base64 -d
r�[1m
</code></pre>

<p>Running <code>hexdump</code> on the output we can identify the characters:</p>

<pre><code>% echo changeme | base64 -d | hexdump -C
00000000  72 16 a7 81 e9 9e      |r.....|
00000006
</code></pre>

<p>Mostly nonsense, but the second byte is interesting: It is an ASCII control
character <sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup>, meaning trips up all sorts of programs which expect to read
printable ASCII characters, such as JSON deserializers.</p>

<p>This bug actually occurred when I was migrating some applications between
different Kubernetes clusters: In the old cluster the application ran without
problems, but I forgot to specify some variable in the new cluster, and it lead
to Go complaining about non-ASCII characters in a JSON string.</p>

<p>I guess the moral of the story is: If you use dummy values be sure that they
cannot be misinterpreted.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><p><h3>October 24, 2020</h3><h3>11 min read</h3></p><hr><p>The COVID pandemic has caused a dramatic economic downturn, and although tech firms are doing well, they’ve <strong>drastically reduced</strong> hiring for new grads.</p><p>So the question is, how as a college student do you land a job at these tech firms — by nailing your internship and getting that return offer!</p><p>This summer, I was interning at Facebook for the second time, and I believe that the feedback I’d received first time round really gave me the edge in securing that return offer with a high rating.</p><p>In my first internship at Facebook, I worked pretty steadily towards my internship project, and completed the project by the final review, and rolled it out for employee dogfooding. I didn’t have time to ship it to production by the end of the internship, so it lay in dogfooding for a year:</p><p>During my second internship at Facebook, I completed my assigned internship project in <strong>4 and a half weeks</strong>, and completed two other projects during the internship, the last of which I was given full rein to scope out myself.</p><p>I was literally <strong>3x more productive</strong> than during my first internship at Facebook!</p><p>The eagle-eyed amongst you will notice I shipped my second internship’s project <strong>before</strong> my first one!</p><h2 id="how-do-you-stay-productive-just-keep-swimming"><a href="#how-do-you-stay-productive-just-keep-swimming" aria-label="how do you stay productive just keep swimming permalink"></a>How do you stay productive? Just keep swimming!</h2><p>The single biggest factor to all of this is that I didn’t get <strong>stuck</strong> on a task for a long time. Usually the biggest drain of our time is just being stuck and not knowing what to do; the actual act of programming is comparatively short.</p><p>So how do you <strong>unblock</strong> yourself?</p><h3 id="1-ask-a-lot-of-questions"><a href="#1-ask-a-lot-of-questions" aria-label="1 ask a lot of questions permalink"></a>1. Ask a LOT of Questions!</h3><p>This is the #1 hack to being productive in your internship and something I didn’t do nearly enough first time round at FB.</p><p>It might seem counter-intuitive - surely asking a lot of questions means you’re a burden to your manager and wasting other people’s time? And that you’re not independent enough? Well, so long as you spend a bit of time searching internal wikis / internet beforehand and clearly explain what specifically you’re struggling with, the other full-timers will be glad to help!</p><p>My first intern manager explained it to me by discussing <em>team hours</em> - if I spend 2 hours stuck on something, that’s 2 team hours spent on that task, compared to only 10 team minutes if I ask someone else.</p><p>Definitely bias towards asking questions when ramping up - the more questions you ask, the quicker you’ll ramp up and the quicker you’ll start shipping code and making an <em>impact</em>. And that <em>impact</em> far outweighs the questions you asked at the start of the internship - your productivity is like an exponential curve!</p><h3 id="2-take-breaks-dont-work-yourself-into-the-ground"><a href="#2-take-breaks-dont-work-yourself-into-the-ground" aria-label="2 take breaks dont work yourself into the ground permalink"></a>2. Take Breaks. Don’t work yourself into the ground.</h3><p>This might seem obvious, but it’s still worth reiterating. Social media often promotes an unhealthy “superhuman” culture, which idolises people who work 100 hour+ weeks. Setting boundaries when working remotely is really important - I personally used the 10am daily stand-up meeting and my dinner to define my work boundaries (10am to 6:30pm).</p><p>Most tech companies care more about <strong>results</strong> than <strong>time put in</strong>, and actually some managers will advise <em>against</em> promotions / return offers if they think the amount you’re working is unsustainable (<em>especially</em> important if you’re super keen!).</p><h3 id="3-task-oriented-learning"><a href="#3-task-oriented-learning" aria-label="3 task oriented learning permalink"></a>3. Task-Oriented Learning</h3><p>It’s all too easy to get <em>paralysed</em> by a lack of knowledge, especially if you’re in a completely new tech stack. The mantra I have to get myself moving is to learn on a <strong>need-to-know basis</strong>: <em>just enough</em> to finish my task, not necessarily to understand <em>all</em> the details.</p><p>One way I learn “just enough” is to <em>learn by example</em> from existing code in the codebase. Not sure how <code>someComplicatedFunction</code> is meant to be used? Search for all the <code>someComplicatedFunction</code> function call sites in the codebase and go through each call site in turn.</p><p>I like to think of this as an <em>iterative deepening</em> approach to learning - you can always go back and learn it more in depth, but breaking off as small a chunk as possible helps you get going and…</p><div><p>Often what you’re evaluated on as an intern is your assigned project. So whilst learning and exploring beyond your team is something I wholeheartedly endorse, it should not come at the expense of your project.</p><p>Do a good job on your main project first, <strong>then</strong> you’ll be free to try new things without the pressure of the project deadlines!</p></div><h3 id="4-get-feedback-regularly"><a href="#4-get-feedback-regularly" aria-label="4 get feedback regularly permalink"></a>4. Get Feedback Regularly!</h3><p>The tighter your feedback loop, the quicker you’ll be able to correct course. Remember, getting feedback early saves <em>team hours</em>! It also improves the odds of you getting a return offer - if you have a performance review 5 weeks in, but you ask your manager for feedback 2 weeks in, that gives you 3 weeks until the review to work on the areas that need improvement!</p><p>Ways you can do this:</p><ul><li>Split code into <strong>small commits</strong> - these are much easier to review, and you can get feedback for one commit whilst you are working on later commits.</li><li>Submit <strong>work-in-progress</strong> versions of your code if you’re stuck - having code to look at makes it much easier for your teammates to help you out.</li><li>Write design docs / plans of action. Writing down a plan helps clarify parts of the task you’re unsure of, and for others to clear things up.</li></ul><h3 id="5-work-on-tasks-in-parallel"><a href="#5-work-on-tasks-in-parallel" aria-label="5 work on tasks in parallel permalink"></a>5. Work on Tasks in Parallel</h3><p>You see that internship project plan with clearly laid out milestones? It’s a lot more flexible than you think.</p><p>Plan out your project in terms of <strong>dependencies</strong> and work on a later milestone if you’re blocked on the current milestone.</p><p>E.g. if you’re waiting on the designs for your frontend UI milestone, start work on the backend milestone.</p><p>Better yet, ping the designer early and proactively arrange meetings to provide them technical feedback. If you can <em>unblock</em> them, then it will speed up your project.</p><h2 id="quality-of-work"><a href="#quality-of-work" aria-label="quality of work permalink"></a>Quality of Work</h2><p>There’s no point churning out code if it requires significant code review, or worse, needs to be rewritten during / after your internship. Remember the whole <em>team hours</em> we mentioned - if it takes you an hour to write some code, but then 3 hours of back-and-forth review and revisions, that’s much worse than spending 2 hours writing the same code, but getting it signed off after 15 minutes of review.</p><h3 id="6-feel-free-to-make-mistakes---just-dont-do-it-twice"><a href="#6-feel-free-to-make-mistakes---just-dont-do-it-twice" aria-label="6 feel free to make mistakes   just dont do it twice permalink"></a>6. Feel free to make mistakes - just don’t do it twice</h3><p>As an intern, you’re not expected to be able to churn out line-perfect code from day one - the most important thing is to <em>show improvement</em>.</p><p>As we said earlier, the quickest way to ramp-up is to get feedback. It’s much better to push out code even if you’re not sure it’s the best way of doing things, than to spend time stuck. So feel free to make mistakes - you’re an intern so you’re not going to be judged too harshly! Just note down the kinds of things flagged at code review and keep a checklist to go over the next time you submit for review.</p><p>The general trend the managers are looking for is that you don’t repeat the same kinds of mistakes (you respond to feedback) and that the amount of feedback / revision needed decreases over time.</p><h3 id="7-dont-just-hack-together-code-to-get-it-to-work"><a href="#7-dont-just-hack-together-code-to-get-it-to-work" aria-label="7 dont just hack together code to get it to work permalink"></a>7. Don’t just hack together code to get it to work!</h3><p>Hacking around seems good for exploratory solutions, but you’re incurring <strong>technical debt</strong>, which is especially costly for large features. See, whilst you speed up the first 80% of development (as you get something working quick), the last 20% of polishing and paying back the debt is what really slows you down. I encountered this a lot in my first internship where I’d think I was blasting through a task until I hit the polishing wall…</p><p>More crucially, hacking and copy-pasting code also makes you a little myopic, as all you’re focused about is <strong>getting the code to work</strong>, when instead you should…</p><h3 id="8-plan-for-future-use"><a href="#8-plan-for-future-use" aria-label="8 plan for future use permalink"></a>8. Plan for future use</h3><p>Codebases evolve. The code you check-in now will be used by someone else (and likely yourself!) so it is worth thinking about the manageability of the code - how much code will need to be changed for someone to extend your code to cover another use case? (This is dubbed the <strong>blast radius</strong> of the code).</p><p>Think about <strong>why</strong> you’re doing the task, not just <strong>what</strong> the task is. This will help you figure out how your code might be used in the future.</p><h3 id="9-checked-in-code--perfect-code"><a href="#9-checked-in-code--perfect-code" aria-label="9 checked in code  perfect code permalink"></a>9. Checked-in code != perfect code</h3><p>Just because it got accepted for code review in the past, doesn’t mean it’s good code! Best practices change over time, as people discover better design patterns (think React hooks!). It’s also easy to forget that the person who wrote the code is also human, and might have cut corners to meet a deadline. Equally, reviewers may not catch all bugs!</p><p>This leads nicely onto the next point:</p><h3 id="10-dont-take-things-for-granted"><a href="#10-dont-take-things-for-granted" aria-label="10 dont take things for granted permalink"></a>10. Don’t take things for granted</h3><p>It’s easy to get trapped in a mindset of just ticking off tasks set in your internship, but remember you’re still a valuable member of the team, so don’t be afraid to contribute further:</p><p>Contribute to the wiki - you’ve got a fresh perspective having just ramped up, so you’ll know which bits of the codebase you found especially hard to understand. Fix bugs, write tests that catch them.
File tasks about parts of the codebase you think can be improved. Refactor the codebase so it is in a better state after you left it.</p><p>All these things demonstrate <strong>initiative</strong> and will really distinguish you from other interns.</p><div><h3>Level up your software engineering skills!</h3><p>Want to find out more savvy tips about software engineering and more?

Read and review other code</h3><p>Reading other team members’ code gives you a broader picture of what your team is working on and is also a good way of learning best practices.</p><p>Reviewing code feels daunting and the power dynamics seem wrong - how can I as an intern know how to write better code than a full-timer? The full-timers are human too, and a fresh pair of eyes on the code can pick up errors they might not have spotted. This way you’re also contributing to improving the code quality through your feedback.</p><p>Not sure how to start? Look at how other team members review code. One trick I used was to review a coworker’s commit, and afterwards look at what else my manager spotted when reviewing that commit. Like with code reviews on my own code, I kept a checklist of the kinds of …</p></article></div>

I found an odd email in my inbox yesterday from a company claiming ownership of a Python package, <a href="https://pypi.org/project/ivy/">Ivy</a>, that I registered on the Python Package Index back in August 2016, more than four years ago. The company is claiming ownership of the package on the basis of a <a href="https://trademarks.ipo.gov.uk/ipo-tmcase/page/Results/1/UK00003521605">UK trademark</a> on the word "ivy" filed in August 2020.
</p>
<p>
Here's the full text of the email:
</p>
<div>
<p>
Dear Mr. Mulholland,
</p>
<p>
We are genuinely sorry to be the bearers of bad news, but we are writing
after following the <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0541/#how-to-request-a-name-transfer">advice</a> on
the PyPI website. We would kindly like to request that the "ivy" package name be released from PyPI, on the grounds that it violates our <a href="https://trademarks.ipo.gov.uk/ipo-tmcase/page/Results/1/UK00003521605">trademark</a>.
PyPI lists <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0541/#invalid-projects">trademark violation</a> as grounds to invalidate a project on PyPI, with subsequent removal. If you would be more comfortable waiting for official involvement of PyPI before releasing the name, then we will gladly <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0541/#how-to-request-a-name-transfer">open a new issue</a> with PyPI.
</p>
<p>
Please let us know if you have any questions regarding this request.
</p>
<p>
Kind Regards,<br>
The Ivy Team

I have no idea what this company does, they didn't link to their website, but they probably sell yoga mats judging from the stretchiness of this stretch.

Name Shortages and Namespacing
</h3>
<p>
Unfortunately the Python Package Index uses a single flat namespace for all packages so the name famine is a real and growing problem. I've been disappointed all too many times myself to find that a name I wanted to use was occupied by an abandoned project that hadn't been touched in years. (This isn't the case for <a href="https://github.com/dmulholl/ivy">Ivy</a> which is being actively developed.)
</p>
<p>
The problem must be getting serious as the Package Index's maintainers have introduced a set of formal guidelines and processes (<a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0541/">PEP 541</a>) for arbitrating disputes over package names — I certainly don't envy them the task.
I think the long-term solution instead is to introduce namespacing by username so packages like <code>dmulholl/ivy</code> and <code>yogamasters/ivy</code> can happily coexist.
</p>
<p>
I've actually been approached several times over the years by people wanting control over the <code>ivy</code> package. Usually they offer to buy it from me — this is the first time I've been threatened with a trademark. It'll be interesting to see how the Package Index maintainers handle the dispute.

 	<div><p>Tankred loves working in open source and focuses on Security and UX. After working on email encryption (OpenPGP), he joined Lightning Labs as lead application developer. Since then he’s been able to work full time on Bitcoin key management in the context of a Square Crypto grant.</p><h2>The risks of Bitcoin custody for end users</h2><p>Bitcoin is an asset that is difficult to store safely. If Bitcoin is to reach mass adoption the majority of users will likely not be very technically savvy. With that comes systemic risk that the community needs to address and find proper tools for. As of today users have several choices when it comes to custody. All come with a certain set of risks and tradeoffs.</p><h3>Keeping coins on the exchange</h3><p>Many users, especially newcomers keep their coins on the exchange. <a href="https://thenextweb.com/hardfork/2019/12/02/satoshi-nakaboto-coinbase-users-hold-nearly-1-million-bitcoin-in-their-wallets/">Coinbase currently holds around 1 million BTC</a> on behalf of its users. These risks have been addressed many times elsewhere. So I won’t go into them at length here. But among the biggest threats are the risk of the exchange getting hacked or becoming insolvent. Another big one is the user’s account getting hacked e.g. through a social engineering attack or a SIM swap attack. While keeping your coins on the exchange gives users a similar user experience as with a bank, this unfortunately does not come with the same security guarantees such as deposit insurance.</p><h3>Manage a seed</h3><p>The second option users have is to store their coins in their own wallet and manage a 24 word seed phrase via a paper backup. While this is usually a good place to start, once users start putting life changing amounts of value behind that seed phrase, they have to think about things like redundancy and security of their paper backup via a passphrase. Anyone who has helped to onboard new bitcoiners knows how difficult that conversation can be. In my own experience most people can write down a seed phrase and store their backup without much of a problem. Talking to them about redundancy and a passphrase usually leads to the conversation ending very quickly. Either they dismiss these risks or just decide to keep their coins on the exchange.</p><h3>Seedless multisig</h3><p>There are of course seedless multi-sig solutions in the market like the Casa App. But these have the downside of being closed source and often times expensive. Paying a subscription fee which is a substantial part of a user’s holdings isn’t an option for many newcomers.</p><h2>From PGP to Signal: encrypted messaging as an example</h2><p>Having worked in the email encryption space, I know how hard it is to convince users to adopt better security and privacy practices. I co-founded Whiteout Mail in 2013 to make PGP more accessible to mainstream users. The mistake was thinking that we could change the users’ behavior. Today the strong set of PGP keys on SKS public key servers is around 50k (basically nothing in terms of internet scale). Many in the security industry have since given up on PGP and email encryption in general.</p><p>Enter Signal. The Signal messaging protocol showed us how it needs to be done. In contrast to PGP the Signal protocol did not require users to change their behavior. Public keys were automatically fetched from a key server which verified the user's phone number. This reduction in security by trusting a central key server was criticized by many in the IT security industry. But these critics underestimated the potential upside in terms of usability and adoption. Due to its ease of use, the Signal protocol could be added to existing messaging applications such as WhatsApp with a simple software update. This meant that over 3 billion WhatsApp users can use end-to-end encrypted messaging without needing to understand the technical details.</p><p>I believe that Bitcoin needs to go through a similar evolution to achieve higher market adoption for self custody.</p><h2>Security Nihilism</h2><p>Having these types of discussion with hardcore Bitcoiners often reminds me of a quote by Alex Stamos, former CSO at Yahoo and Facebook.</p><p><i>“Security Nihilism is a set of beliefs that includes the assumptions that all attackers are perfect, that everybody faces the worst possible threat scenario, or that any compromise to make a security feature more widespread should be considered a bug.”</i></p><ul><li>Alex Stamos, Black Hat 2017 Keynote</li></ul><p>I believe as a community we need to overcome these restricting ways of thinking to enable creativity and give ourselves permission to experiment.</p><h2>We need to ask better questions</h2><p>A good start is to ask better questions. Looking at the current landscape of wallets and products, are we really addressing user needs? In order to overcome the gap between exchanges and non-custodial wallets the following questions come to mind:</p><ol><li>Can we make it easier for newcomers to secure small amounts?</li><li>Can we engineer better UX and better security than custodial solutions?</li><li>Can we “upsell” additional security over time as user funds grow?</li></ol><p>My attempt at addressing these questions is something I call the Photon SDK.</p><h2>Photon SDK: seedless wallet toolbox</h2><p>Photon’s primary goal is to explore UX and security tradeoffs, specifically for mobile wallets. It’s a set of fully open source components that are currently written in JavaScript for React Native applications. I chose React Native since it allows cheap and easy prototyping during the exploration phase. As these concepts solidify and there is demand by wallets, native implementations for iOS and Android are the next step. The SDK currently consists of these three components:</p><ol><li><a href="https://github.com/photon-sdk/photon-keyserver">photon-keyserver</a>: stores high entropy encryption keys and provides server side security such as rate limited PIN authentication</li><li><a href="https://github.com/photon-sdk/photon-lib">photon-lib</a>: a React Native client module that can be integrated into any wallet application</li><li><a href="https://github.com/photon-sdk/photon-app">photon-app</a>: a demo React Native application that documents how these components work together in a final product</li></ol><h2>2-of-2 seedless cloud backup</h2><p>Photon’s encrypted cloud backup is very simple and provides a 2-of-2 security model, as described below.</p><p><img alt="photon setup" height="879" src="https://advbitcoin.s3.amazonaws.com/images/Screenshot_2020-09-14_at_12.38.24.width-800.png" width="800"></p><p>Firstly the wallet seed is encrypted client side and then stored on the user’s iCloud or Google Drive (depending on if they use iOS or Android). Then the encryption key is stored on the photon-keyserver which is protected with rate-limited PIN authentication. The idea is that an attacker would need access to the user’s Apple or Google account to access their cloud storage, as well as know the PIN required to download the encryption key.</p><h2>Key server Authentication</h2><p>The key server stores the encryption key required to decrypt the seed from the user’s cloud storage. As such it is important to secure access using a robust authentication scheme. Photon does not require users to sign up with their email address or to create a separate account. Rather, a random key ID that uniquely identifies the user is generated on the key server and stored in the user’s iCloud or Google Drive. This key ID as well as a user chosen PIN is used to authenticate to the key server. Furthermore server-side rate limiting is enforced to increase the security of the user chosen PIN. This allows the seed to be encrypted with a high entropy random encryption key while requiring the user to only remember a short PIN. Currently a time lock of 7 days is enforced on encryption key download after 10 failed authentication attempts. This results in about 19 years to brute force a simple four digit PIN.</p><h2>Time delayed PIN recovery</h2><p>As users store considerable value in their wallets, they might desire to set a recovery email address or phone in case they forget their PIN. Since I wanted to retain the fact that Bitcoin does not have a login this feature is purely optional. The SDK supports both email addresses as well as phone numbers for PIN recovery. Users verify ownership of their accounts via email or sms respectively. Upon PIN reset a 30 day time lock is enforced on the key server to mitigate SIM swap attacks. The idea is that an attacker would not have enough time to steal the user’s funds as users would notice loss of their phone number and/or email account within that time. After the time delay users can set a new PIN and recover their funds.</p><h2>Photon SDK roadmap</h2><p>While time locked PIN based authentication might provide a sufficient layer of security for smaller amounts of value, I’d like to enable additional layers of security as the user’s funds grow. This approach is inline with the “upselling” strategy proposed earlier.</p><h3>Backup integrity checks a.k.a. “Health Checks”</h3><p>This feature will primarily be implemented in the demo wallet application and represent a UX pattern that the SDK will promote as a best practice. Namely to notify the user every 90 days day to practice key recovery. Basically the user is asked for their PIN and the encrypted seed on the user's cloud will be checked for integrity and compared with the wallet’s installed key. If the user has forgotten their PIN or the encrypted key in their cloud storage is corrupt the app can easily recover by rotating keys and creating a new backup.</p><h3>2FA for photon-keyserver (Google Auth &amp; Fido U2F)</h3><p>As the user’s funds grow a simple PIN based authentication might not be enough security for many users. In this case the wallet should suggest an additional 2FA (2 factor authentication) method such as Google Authenticator or FIDO U2F compatible hardware keys. Upon key recovery the wallet app will ask users for their PIN as well as one 2FA method.</p><h3>Seedless multisig</h3><p>Another feature in the roadmap is open source seedless multisig with a 2-of-3 or a 3-of-5 setup. This will likely be demanded by more advanced users with higher values to secure. There are many directions this feature could go but file based PSBT and XPUB sharing such as in ColdCard wallets would enable a mobile experience that does not require a desktop computer.</p><h3>Native iOS &amp; Android libraries</h3><p>As interest in the Bitcoin ecosystem for Photon grows, wallets will likely need native library implementations via Swift and Java. Please reach out if you are experienced in native mobile development and would like to contribute in this regard!</p><p>Demo app on Testflight</p><p>I’m …</p></div></article></div>

<![CDATA[Porting Firecracker to a Raspberry Pi 4 (2019)]]>

October 24, 2020 | https://blog.cloudkernels.net/posts/firecracker-rpi4/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://blog.cloudkernels.net/posts/firecracker-rpi4/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      

<p>Since we got our hands on the new Raspberry Pi 4, we started exploring how
various virtualization technologies behave on the board. First thing we tried is how to run <a href="https://cloudkernels.github.io/posts/rpi4-64bit-virt/">Nabla</a> on it and how it compares to native KVM.</p>

<p>Next thing we wanted to try is <a href="https://github.com/firecracker-microvm/firecracker">firecracker</a>, the notorious micro-VMM that
Amazon Lambda &amp; Fargate run on. To our disappointment, firecracker was not
<a href="https://github.com/firecracker-microvm/firecracker/issues/1196">yet</a> running on RPi4. So we started looking into coding in the necessary
changes :)</p>

<p>After a bit of investigation, we figured out that the key missing piece is
support for the GICv2 ARM interrupt controller. In fact, firecracker only
supports GIC version 3 since it was open-sourced, but not version 2, which is
the version appearing in the Raspberry Pi series, as well as in other popular
boards, like the Hikey 970 we got our hands on, or Khadas VIM3. A bit more
digging into the internals of firecracker and the Linux kernel, helped us
work out the details and open a <a href="https://github.com/firecracker-microvm/firecracker/pull/1235">pull-request</a> which adds support for the
missing parts.</p>

<h4 id="changes-in-firecracker">Changes in Firecracker</h4>

<p>The Generic Interrupt Controller (GIC) is the IP block in the ARM processors
that implements interrupt handling. The Linux kernel supports user- and
kernel-space emulation for GICv2 as well as GICv3 and v4. However, Firecracker
only handles the GICv3-related configuration of the virtual GIC (VGIC).
Similarly, setting up the FDT for the guest microVM from Firecracker only
handles GIC-v3 devices.</p>

<p>In terms of code organization, the GIC related code currently exposes a function
for setting up GICv3 performing the corresponding <code>ioctl</code> KVM commands. The
first part of our PR changes this by introducing a GIC Trait which defines the
common interface for all GIC implementations. Even though it is still under
discussion, what exactly will be in the Trait in its final form, it will be
something along the following lines:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="rs"><span>/// Trait for GIC devices.
</span><span></span><span>pub</span><span> </span><span>trait</span><span> </span>GICDevice<span> </span>{<span>
</span><span>    </span><span>/// Returns the GIC version of the device
</span><span></span><span>    </span><span>fn</span> <span>version</span>(<span>&amp;</span><span>self</span>)<span> </span>-&gt; <span>u32</span>;<span>
</span><span>
</span><span>    </span><span>/// Returns the file descriptor of the GIC device
</span><span></span><span>    </span><span>fn</span> <span>device_fd</span>(<span>&amp;</span><span>self</span>)<span> </span>-&gt; <span>&amp;</span><span>DeviceFd</span>;<span>
</span><span>
</span><span>    </span><span>/// Returns an array with GIC device properties
</span><span></span><span>    </span><span>fn</span> <span>device_properties</span>(<span>&amp;</span><span>self</span>)<span> </span>-&gt; <span>&amp;</span>[<span>u64</span>];<span>
</span><span></span>}<span>
</span></code></pre></div>
<p>With this in place, we can define objects per GIC version, which implement this
Trait, and still have the rest of the code deal with the <code>GICDevice</code> Trait,
which is transparent to the GIC version.</p>

<p>The implementations for each version, implement the Trait and a <code>new</code> function
which is used to create the new object:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="rs"><span>pub</span><span> </span><span>fn</span> <span>new</span>(vm: <span>&amp;</span><span>VmFd</span>,<span> </span>vcpu_count: <span>u64</span>)<span> </span>-&gt; <span>Result</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Box</span><span>&lt;</span>GICDevice<span>&gt;&gt;</span><span>
</span></code></pre></div>
<p>The differentiation between the two versions lays in the VGIC register
attributes that each device exposes. As a result, the work we need to do is essentially to <code>mmap</code> their addresses.</p>

<p>GICv2 relevant addresses include the <strong>distributor</strong> and <strong>cpu</strong> groups:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="rs"><span>/* Setting up the distributor attribute.

<p>whereas the GICv3 includes the <strong>distributor</strong> and <strong>redistributor</strong> groups:</p>

<p>Regarding the FDT creation, there are differences between v2 and v3 regarding
the interrupt controller <code>intc</code> node.</p>

<p>First, we need to define the GICv2 <code>compatible</code> property to be <code>arm,gic-400</code>,
since it is the GIC-400 chip which implements GICv2. Next is the <code>reg</code>
property of the FDT, which includes the addresses and the corresponding sizes of
the GIC registers, i.e. distributor and CPU for GICv2, distributor and
redistributor for GICv3. Finally, we fix the <code>interrupts</code> property which
determines the interrupt source of the VGIC maintenance interrupt. The
corresponding values for GICv2 were taken from the respective <a href="https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/master/Documentation/devicetree/bindings/interrupt-controller/arm%2Cgic.yaml">Linux Kernel entries</a>.</p>

<h4 id="build-firecracker-with-rpi4-support">Build firecracker with RPi4 support</h4>

<p>While waiting for the patch to merge upstream you can go ahead and check out it
yourself.</p>

<p>Clone and build our fork of firecracker (keep in mind that while the PR review
is going on, we might force-update the branch).</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">$ git clone https://github.com/cloudkernels/firecracker.git
$ <span>cd</span> firecracker
$ ./tools/devtool build</code></pre></div>
<p>Next you need a kernel image and a root filesystem to run with your firecracker
build. You can grab the pre-built kernel image and rootfs here:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">$ wget https://s3.amazonaws.com/spec.ccfc.min/img/aarch64/ubuntu_with_ssh/kernel/vmlinux.bin
$ wget https://s3.amazonaws.com/spec.ccfc.min/img/aarch64/ubuntu_with_ssh/fsfiles/xenial.rootfs.ext4 </code></pre></div>
<p>Alternatively, you can build your own kernel and rootfs using the following
steps provided by the firecracker docs
<a href="https://github.com/cloudkernels/firecracker/blob/master/docs/rootfs-and-kernel-setup.md">here</a></p>

<h4 id="launch-our-image">Launch our image</h4>

<p>To launch our image we will use the <a href="https://github.com/firecracker-microvm/firectl">firectl</a> tool. We need, to setup a tap
device for the networking or our firecracker microVM.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">$ sudo ip tuntap add dev tap0 mode tap
$ sudo ip addr add <span>172</span>.16.0.1/24 dev tap0
$ sudo ip link <span>set</span> tap0 up</code></pre></div>
<p>And we launch the microVM using firectl:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">firectl --firecracker-binary<span>=</span><span>${</span><span>PATH_TO_FC_BIN</span><span>}</span> --kernel<span>=</span>vmlinux.bin <span>\

</span><span></span>	--root-drive<span>=</span>./nginx_fc.ext4</code></pre></div>
<p>Here, we used here the <code>ip</code> kernel boot parameter to give the <code>172.16.0.42</code>.</p>

<p>Finally, we try out our nginx server:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="html">curl 172.16.0.42

        <span>font-family</span>: Tahoma, Verdana, Arial, <span>sans-serif</span>;
    }
&lt;/<span>style</span>&gt;
&lt;/<span>head</span>&gt;
&lt;<span>body</span>&gt;

           <p>I often want to learn about some topic, from very broad (like "C# programming") to very specific (like "Source Generators in C#"). There are lots of resources about any topic (blog posts, articles, videos, courses, books, etc.) and some are good, some bad. On Google, you get results sorted by some algorithm and they may not necessary be the best for learning or suitable for your level of knowledge (e.g., beginner/advanced). Search results are just not very well curated.</p><div><p>I imagine there should be a site where anyone could register links to such learning resources, organize them by topics and rate them, so the best resources for the topic are selected by the community.</p><p>I know that for programming topics, there are pages on GitHub like <a href="https://github.com/quozd/awesome-dotnet">Awesome .NET</a>&nbsp;or <a href="https://github.com/Solido/awesome-flutter">Awesome Flutter</a>&nbsp;where people create curated lists of resources about some programming language.

<p><em>With thanks to <a href="https://twitter.com/inventednight/">Niki Carroll</a>, winny, and kurufu for their
invaluable proofreading and advice.</em></p>

<h2 id="preword">Preword</h2>

<p>By <a href="https://twitter.com/8x5clPW2/status/1311316978703970307">popular demand</a>, I’m doing another
LLVM post. This time, it’s <strong>single static assignment</strong> (or SSA) form, a common feature
in the intermediate representations of optimizing compilers.</p>

<p>Like <a href="https://blog.yossarian.net/2020/09/19/LLVMs-getelementptr-by-example">the last one</a>, SSA is a
topic in compiler and IR design that I <em>mostly</em> understand but could benefit from some self-guided
education on. So here we are.</p>

<h2 id="how-to-represent-a-program">How to represent a program</h2>

<p>At the highest level, a compiler’s job is singular: to turn some source language <em>input</em>
into some machine language <em>output</em>. Internally, this breaks down into a sequence of clearly
delineated<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup> tasks:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Lexing</strong> the source into a sequence of tokens</li>
  <li><strong>Parsing</strong> the token stream into an <strong>abstract syntax tree</strong>, or AST<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup></li>
  <li><strong>Validating</strong> the AST (e.g., ensuring that all uses of identifiers are consistent with the
source language’s scoping and definition rules)<sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3">3</a></sup></li>
  <li><strong>Translating</strong> the AST into machine code, with all of its complexities (instruction selection,
register allocation, frame generation, &amp;c)</li>
</ol>

<p>In a <strong>single-pass</strong> compiler, (4) is monolithic: machine code is generated as the compiler walks
the AST, with no revisiting of previously generated code. This is extremely fast (in terms of
compiler performance) in exchange for some a few significant limitations:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Optimization potential: because machine code is generated in a single pass, it can’t be revisited
for optimizations. Single-pass compilers tend to generate extremely slow and <em>conservative</em>
machine code.</p>

    <p>By way of example: the
  <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wiki/hjl-tools/x86-psABI/x86-64-psABI-1.0.pdf">System V ABI</a>
  (used by Linux and macOS) defines
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_zone_(computing)">a special 128-byte region</a> beyond the
  current stack pointer (<code>%rsp</code>) that can be used by leaf functions whose stack frames fit within
  it. This, in turn, saves a few stack management instructions in the function prologue and
  epilogue.</p>

    <p>A single-pass compiler will struggle to take advantage of this ABI-supplied
  optimization: it needs to emit a stack slot for each automatic variable as they’re visited,
  and cannot revisit its function prologue for erasure if all variables fit within the red zone.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Language limitations: single-pass compilers struggle with common language design decisions, like
allowing use of identifiers before their declaration or definition. For example, the following
is valid C++:</p>

    <div><div><pre><code>  <span>class</span> <span>Rect</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>public:</span>
    <span>int</span> <span>area</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span> <span>return</span> <span>width</span><span>()</span> <span>*</span> <span>height</span><span>();</span> <span>}</span>
    <span>int</span> <span>width</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span> <span>return</span> <span>5</span><span>;</span> <span>}</span>
    <span>int</span> <span>height</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span> <span>return</span> <span>5</span><span>;</span> <span>}</span>
  <span>};</span>
</code></pre></div>    </div>

    <p>C and C++ <em>generally</em> require pre-declaration and/or definition for identifiers, but
  member function bodies may reference the entire class scope. This will frustrate a
  single-pass compiler, which expects <code>Rect::width</code> and <code>Rect::height</code> to already exist
  in some symbol lookup table for call generation.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Consequently, (virtually) all modern compilers are <strong>multi-pass</strong>.</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.yossarian.net/assets/multipass.jpg" alt="Pictured: Leeloo Dallas from The Fifth Element holding up her multi-pass.">
<em>“multi-pass” — Leeloo Dallas</em></p>

<p>Multi-pass compilers break the <em>translation</em> phase down even more:</p>

<ol>
  <li>The AST is lowered into an <strong>intermediate representation</strong>, or IR</li>
  <li>Analyses (or passes) are performed on the IR, refining it according to some optimization
profile (code size, performance, &amp;c)</li>
  <li>The IR is either translated to machine code <em>or</em> lowered to <em>another</em> IR, for further target
specialization or optimization<sup id="fnref:4" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:4">4</a></sup></li>
</ol>

<p>So, we want an IR that’s easy to <em>correctly</em> transform and that’s amenable to optimization. Let’s
talk about why IRs that have the <strong>static single assignment</strong> property fill that niche.</p>

<h2 id="ssa-form">SSA form</h2>

<p>At its core, the SSA form of any program source program introduces only one new constraint:
all variables are assigned (i.e., stored to) <strong>exactly once</strong>.</p>

<p>By way of example: the following (not actually very helpful) function is <strong>not</strong> in a valid SSA form
with respect to the <code>flags</code> variable:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>int</span> <span>helpful_open</span><span>(</span><span>char</span> <span>*</span><span>fname</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>int</span> <span>flags</span> <span>=</span> <span>O_RDWR</span><span>;</span>

  <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>!</span><span>access</span><span>(</span><span>fname</span><span>,</span> <span>F_OK</span><span>))</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>flags</span> <span>|=</span> <span>O_CREAT</span><span>;</span>
  <span>}</span>

  <span>int</span> <span>fd</span> <span>=</span> <span>open</span><span>(</span><span>fname</span><span>,</span> <span>flags</span><span>,</span> <span>0644</span><span>);</span>

  <span>return</span> <span>fd</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Why? Because <code>flags</code> is stored to twice: once for initialization, and (potentially) again inside
the conditional body.</p>

<p>As programmers, we could rewrite <code>helpful_open</code> to only ever store once to each automatic variable:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>int</span> <span>helpful_open</span><span>(</span><span>char</span> <span>*</span><span>fname</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>!</span><span>access</span><span>(</span><span>fname</span><span>,</span> <span>F_OK</span><span>))</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>int</span> <span>flags</span> <span>=</span> <span>O_RDWR</span> <span>|</span> <span>O_CREAT</span><span>;</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>open</span><span>(</span><span>fname</span><span>,</span> <span>flags</span><span>,</span> <span>0644</span><span>);</span>
  <span>}</span> <span>else</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>int</span> <span>flags</span> <span>=</span> <span>O_RDWR</span><span>;</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>open</span><span>(</span><span>fname</span><span>,</span> <span>flags</span><span>,</span> <span>0644</span><span>);</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>But this is clumsy and repetitive: we essentially need to duplicate every chain of uses that
follow any variable that is stored to more than once. That’s not great for readability,
maintainability, or code size.</p>

<p>So, we do what we always do: make the compiler do the hard work for us. Fortunately there exists
a transformation from every valid program into an equivalent SSA form, conditioned on two simple
rules.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Rule #1: Whenever we see a store to an already-stored variable, we replace it with a brand
new “version” of that variable.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Using rule #1 and the example above, we can rewrite <code>flags</code> using <code>_N</code> suffixes to indicate versions:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>int</span> <span>helpful_open</span><span>(</span><span>char</span> <span>*</span><span>fname</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>int</span> <span>flags_0</span> <span>=</span> <span>O_RDWR</span><span>;</span>

  <span>// Declared up here to avoid dealing with C scopes.</span>
  <span>int</span> <span>flags_1</span><span>;</span>
  <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>!</span><span>access</span><span>(</span><span>fname</span><span>,</span> <span>F_OK</span><span>))</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>flags_1</span> <span>=</span> <span>flags_0</span> <span>|</span> <span>O_CREAT</span><span>;</span>
  <span>}</span>

  <span>int</span> <span>fd</span> <span>=</span> <span>open</span><span>(</span><span>fname</span><span>,</span> <span>flags_1</span><span>,</span> <span>0644</span><span>);</span>

  <span>return</span> <span>fd</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>But wait a second: we’ve made a mistake!</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>open(..., flags_1, ...)</code> is incorrect: it unconditionally assigns <code>O_CREAT</code>, which wasn’t in the
original function semantics.</li>
  <li><code>open(..., flags_0, ...)</code> is <strong>also</strong> incorrect: it <em>never</em> assigns <code>O_CREAT</code>, and thus
is wrong for the same reason.</li>
</ul>

<p>So, what do we do? We use rule 2!</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Rule #2: Whenever we need to <em>choose</em> a variable based on control flow, we use the Phi function
(φ) to introduce a <strong>new</strong> variable based on our choice.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Using our example once more:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>int</span> <span>helpful_open</span><span>(</span><span>char</span> <span>*</span><span>fname</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>int</span> <span>flags_0</span> <span>=</span> <span>O_RDWR</span><span>;</span>

    <span>// Declared up here to avoid dealing with C scopes.</span>
    <span>int</span> <span>flags_1</span><span>;</span>
    <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>!</span><span>access</span><span>(</span><span>fname</span><span>,</span> <span>F_OK</span><span>))</span> <span>{</span>
      <span>flags_1</span> <span>=</span> <span>flags_0</span> <span>|</span> <span>O_CREAT</span><span>;</span>
    <span>}</span>

    <span>int</span> <span>flags_2</span> <span>=</span> <span>φ</span><span>(</span><span>flags_0</span><span>,</span> <span>flags_1</span><span>);</span>

    <span>int</span> <span>fd</span> <span>=</span> <span>open</span><span>(</span><span>fname</span><span>,</span> <span>flags_2</span><span>,</span> <span>0644</span><span>);</span>

    <span>return</span> <span>fd</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Our quandary is resolved: <code>open</code> <strong>always</strong> takes <code>flags_2</code>, where <code>flags_2</code> is a fresh SSA variable
produced applying φ to <code>flags_0</code> and <code>flags_1</code>.</p>

<p>Observe, too, that φ is a <strong>symbolic</strong> function: compilers that use SSA forms internally do not
emit real φ functions in generated code<sup id="fnref:5" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:5">5</a></sup>. φ exists <em>solely</em> to reconcile rule #1 with the
existence of control flow.</p>

<p>As such, it’s a little bit silly to talk about SSA forms with C examples (since C and other
high-level languages are what we’re translating from in the first place). Let’s dive into how
LLVM’s IR actually represents them.</p>

<h2 id="ssa-in-llvm">SSA in LLVM</h2>

<p>First of all, let’s see what happens when we run our very first <code>helpful_open</code> through <code>clang</code>
with no optimizations:</p>

<p><em>(View it on <a href="https://godbolt.org/z/6ea8Pq">Godbolt</a>.)</em></p>

<p>So, we call <code>open</code> with <code>%3</code>, which comes from…a <code>load</code> from an <code>i32*</code> named <code>%flags</code>?
Where’s the φ?</p>

<p>This is something that <em>consistently</em> slips me up when reading LLVM’s IR: only <em>values</em>,
<strong>not</strong> memory, are in SSA form. Because we’ve compiled with optimizations disabled, <code>%flags</code> is
just a stack slot that we can <code>store</code> into as many times as we please, and that’s <em>exactly</em> what
LLVM has elected to do above.</p>

<p>As such, LLVM’s SSA-based optimizations aren’t all that useful when passed IR that makes direct
use of stack slots. We want to <em>maximize</em> our use of SSA variables, whenever possible, to make
future optimization passes as effective as possible.</p>

<p>This is where <a href="https://llvm.org/docs/Passes.html#mem2reg-promote-memory-to-register"><code>mem2reg</code></a> comes in:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This file (optimization pass) promotes memory references to be register references. It promotes
alloca instructions which only have loads and stores as uses. An alloca is transformed by using
dominator frontiers to place phi nodes, then traversing the function in depth-first order to
rewrite loads and stores as appropriate. This is just the standard SSA construction algorithm to
construct “pruned” SSA form.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>(Parenthetical mine.)</p>

<p><code>mem2reg</code> gets run at <code>-O1</code> and higher, so let’s do exactly that:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>define</span> <span>dso_local</span> <span>i32</span> <span>@helpful_open</span><span>(</span><span>i8</span><span>*</span> <span>nocapture</span> <span>readonly</span> <span>%fname</span><span>)</span> <span>local_unnamed_addr</span> <span>#0</span> <span>{</span>
<span>entry:</span>
  <span>%call</span> <span>=</span> <span>call</span> <span>i32</span> <span>@access</span><span>(</span><span>i8</span><span>*</span> <span>%fname</span><span>,</span> <span>i32</span> <span>0</span><span>)</span> <span>#4</span>
  <span>%tobool.not</span> <span>=</span> <span>icmp</span> <span>eq</span> <span>i32</span> <span>%call</span><span>,</span> <span>0</span>
  <span>%spec.select</span> <span>=</span> <span>select</span> <span>i1</span> <span>%tobool.not</span><span>,</span> <span>i32</span> <span>66</span><span>,</span> <span>i32</span> <span>2</span>
  <span>%call1</span> <span>=</span> <span>call</span> <span>i32</span> <span>(</span><span>i8</span><span>*,</span> <span>i32</span><span>,</span> <span>...)</span> <span>@open</span><span>(</span><span>i8</span><span>*</span> <span>%fname</span><span>,</span> <span>i32</span> <span>%spec.select</span><span>,</span> <span>i32</span> <span>420</span><span>)</span> <span>#4</span><span>,</span> <span>!dbg</span> <span>!22</span>
  <span>ret</span> <span>i32</span> <span>%call1</span><span>,</span> <span>!dbg</span> <span>!23</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Foiled again! Our stack slots are gone thanks to <code>mem2reg</code>, but LLVM has actually optimized
<em>too far</em>: it figured out that our flags value is wholly dependent on the return value of our
<code>access</code> call and erased the conditional entirely.</p>

<p>Instead of a φ node, we got this <code>select</code>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>%spec.select</span> <span>=</span> <span>select</span> <span>i1</span> <span>%tobool.not</span><span>,</span> <span>i32</span> <span>66</span><span>,</span> <span>i32</span> <span>2</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>which the <a href="https://llvm.org/docs/LangRef.html#select-instruction">LLVM Language Reference</a>
describes concisely:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The ‘select’ instruction is used to choose one value based on a condition, without IR-level branching.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So we need a better example. Let’s do something that LLVM can’t trivially optimize into a
<code>select</code> (or sequence of <code>select</code>s), like adding an <code>else if</code> with a function that we’ve …</p></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                        

                        <p>Today, we’ll cover some of the ways that you might find quite useful in your everyday work. We’ll go through some of the best practices for logging in AWS Lambda, and we will explain how and why these ways will simplify your&nbsp;AWS Lambda logging. For more information about similar topics, be sure to visit our blog page on our website. But, let’s start with the basics. What is logging?</p>
<h3 id="logging-in-aws-lambda">Logging In AWS Lambda</h3>
<p>AWS Lambda is a service that will automatically monitor Lambda functions for you, and it will report the metrics via Amazon CloudWatch. In order to help you with resolving the function failures, Lambda logs will manage all requests by your function as well as it will automatically store logs that are generated by your code through Amazon CloudWatch Logs.</p>
<p>You’re able to put logging statements in your code which will help in validating that your code is working correctly and as expected. Lambda integrates with&nbsp;<a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/">CloudWatch</a>&nbsp;Logs automatically, and it pushes all the logs from your code to a CloudWatch Logs group which is associated with a Lambda function. It’s worth mentioning that using Lambda logs means that there are no extra charges, but don’t forget that the standard CloudWatch charges will apply.</p>
<h3 id="centralize-the-logging-in-aws-lambda">Centralize The Logging In AWS Lambda</h3>
<p>You should know that there are various log aggregation services like Splunk, Logz.io, Sumologic, Papertrail, Logzilla, Logmatic.io, and numerous others. Why do we need them? They exist to help us move the Lambda logs from our existing CloudWatch Logs to another more stable log service. You should know that, for example, when you’re processing CloudWatch Logs with a Lambda function, you need to be mindful of the number of simultaneous executions it creates since CloudWatch Logs is an asynchronous event source for Lambda. Let’s say that you have 100 functions that run simultaneously. Every one of them will push logs to CloudWatch Logs. Therefore, this, in turn, is able to trigger 100 simultaneous executions of the log shipping function.</p>
<p>Furthermore, this event can potentially double the number of functions that are simultaneously running in your region. You should remember that there is a soft, regional limit of 1000 simultaneous executions for all functions. You can also make a Reversed Concurrency for the log shipping function which will limit its maximum number of simultaneous executions, but there is a risk of losing logs when the log shipping functions are suppressed.</p>
<h3 id="streaming-logs">Streaming Logs</h3>
<p>Take a look at the CloudWatch console, and you’ll see under the “Actions” tab an option to select a log group (one for every Lambda function), and then you can decide whether you should stream the data directly to Amazon’s hosted Elasticsearch service. In case you’re already a user of Elasticsearch service, this will come in quite handy, but if you’re still thinking about the possible options, there are alternatives.</p>
<p>A more exciting way to stream your logs would be to stream them from CloudWatch Logs to a Kinesis stream first because from Kinesis stream Lambda function is able to process logs and forward them toward a log aggregation service of your choosing. With this way of log manipulation, you have complete control over the concurrency of the log shipping function. Following the increase of the log events, you’re able to increase the shard number inside the Kinesis stream which will furthermore lead to an increased number of simultaneous executions of the log shipping function.</p>
<p>When creating a new function from a Lambda console, you’re able to choose from a number of blueprints to push CloudWatch Logs to some other log aggregation service. This option enables you to write a Lambda function that will ship your CloudWatch Logs to a preferred log aggregation service, but there are some things you should be careful about.</p>
<h3 id="new-log-groups-auto-subscription">New Log Groups Auto-Subscription</h3>
<p>Every time you create a new Lambda function, a new log group will be automatically formed in CloudWatch Logs. What you want to avoid is a manual process of subscribing log groups to your function. Enabling CloudTrail and setting up an event pattern in CloudWatch Events will allow you to invoke different Lambda function every time a log group is created. This setup can be done manually from the CloudWatch console. In case you’re working with several different AWS accounts, it’s advisable to avoid making a manual configuration.</p>
<p>Serverless Framework allows you to set up the event source for this function in the serverless.yml file. Remember that you must avoid subscribing the log group for the ship-logs function to itself since it will create an infinite invocation loop. After Lambda creates a new log group for your function, the retention policy is to keep them (forever!). It is totally unnecessary, while the storage for all these logs can cost pretty much since the logs can add up over time. Luckily, you can add another Lambda function which can automatically update the retention policy to something much more adequate</p>
<h3 id="what-is-dashbird-offering">What is Dashbird Offering?</h3>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://mk0dashbirdiotlcuqbg.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/image-1.png" alt="Dashbird Lambda logging AWS" width="696" height="381" srcset="https://mk0dashbirdiotlcuqbg.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/image-1.png 696w, https://mk0dashbirdiotlcuqbg.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/image-1-300x164.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 696px) 100vw, 696px"></p>

<p>You should know that with&nbsp;<a href="http://dashbird.io/">Dashbird</a> you’ll be able to do a lot with little effort, whatsoever. Take into consideration that Dashbird’s data collection goes directly from CloudWatch APIs and that there’s no overhead when it comes to using Dashbird, which is another way of saying that you won’t incur any extra costs nor will your app be slowed down by extra requests. Another perk offered by Dashbird is Live Tailing which essentially gives you the opportunity to receive your function’s log streams in real-time. X-Ray is another benefit provided by Dashbird whose seamless integration gives you the best tracing possibilities and it allows you to keep a close eye on what your invocation is doing.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://mk0dashbirdiotlcuqbg.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/image.png" alt="Dashbird Lambda logging AWS X-Ray" width="703" height="381" srcset="https://mk0dashbirdiotlcuqbg.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/image.png 703w, https://mk0dashbirdiotlcuqbg.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/image-300x163.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 703px) 100vw, 703px"></p>
<p>X-Ray is a potent tool that enables you to trace the data throughout the active cycle of the invocation while it also serves as a tool to track the full extent of an invocation flow. Supporting custom traces, X-Ray gives you the opportunity to track data manually. It’s also worth mentioning that Dashbird can have an automated system of detecting if the X-Ray option is enabled or disabled. In case you open an invocation that belongs to a lambda that has active X-Ray monitoring it’s able to get X-Ray data on-demand while it will also show you the results. We are free to say that Dashbird came through in providing you with an easy way of understanding how and when the time was lost and what actually happened there.</p>
<h3 id="where-does-that-leave-us">Where does that leave us?</h3>
<p>Depending on what your needs are, you should either ship your logs to some of the log aggregation services or even stream your logs using Kinesis log streaming. Be careful when thinking about which log aggregate service you should choose since all of them have their perks and their faults. Try to avoid the infinite invocation loop; therefore the unnecessary added cost. Read the users’ comments and their experiences, their ups, and downs, so you’ll know upfront what you can expect from every single aggregation service and generally how to avoid situations you don’t want to end up in.</p>

                        <p>The use of serverless computing has become a must nowadays, and some of you may already know a thing or two about Amazon Web Services like <a href="https://dashbird.io/knowledge-base/aws-lambda/introduction-to-aws-lambda/">Lambda Functions</a>, Step Functions, and other services AWS provides. However, if this is the first time you hear about them – fantastic!</p>
<p>In this article, we’ll discuss AWS Step Functions, what they are used for, how to use them, and the advantages or disadvantages that they bring.</p>
<h2><span><b>AWS Step Functions 101</b></span></h2>
<p>Before we can jump into Step Functions, you need to familiarize yourself with the basic structure behind them. Step Functions are an AWS-managed service that uses <a href="https://dashbird.io/knowledge-base/well-architected/finite-state-machine/">Finite-State Machine (FSM)</a> model.</p>
<p><em>Why is that important?</em></p>
<p>By coordinating multiple AWS services into different serverless workflows, you can quickly build and update the apps. Additionally, with Step Functions, you’ll be able to both design and run workflows that’ll bring together various services, including Amazon ECS and AWS Lambda, into feature-rich applications.</p>
<h2><b>FSM Model Explained</b></h2>
<p>The two keywords you need to remember are States and Transitions.</p>
<p><em>Now, why are these words so important?</em></p>
<p>FSM model does a simple job – it uses given states and transitions to complete the tasks at hand. Finite-State Machines are also known as a behavioral model. It’s an abstract machine (system) that can be in 1 (one) state at a time, but it can also switch between a finite number of states.</p>
<p>This machine is defined solely by its states and the relationship these states have between themselves. A good and very straightforward example is the “closed-door example.” The door can either be open or closed, and these are the only two possible states. Now, the transition part is the switch between two states, but you need to provide some input first to get there. When you close the door, you’re placing an input. Additionally, the sequence of opening the closed door is known as the switch between two states (transition).</p>
<figure id="attachment_2958" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2958"><img loading="lazy" src="https://mk0dashbirdiotlcuqbg.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screenshot-2020-10-22-at-11.21.00-1024x626.png" alt="StepFunctions state input and transition" width="640" height="391" srcset="https://mk0dashbirdiotlcuqbg.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screenshot-2020-10-22-at-11.21.00-1024x626.png 1024w, https://mk0dashbirdiotlcuqbg.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screenshot-2020-10-22-at-11.21.00-300x183.png 300w, https://mk0dashbirdiotlcuqbg.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screenshot-2020-10-22-at-11.21.00-768x469.png 768w, https://mk0dashbirdiotlcuqbg.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screenshot-2020-10-22-at-11.21.00.png 1162w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2958"><em>StepFunctions state input and transition</em></figcaption></figure>

<p>You can also apply the same thing to other examples, like your daily life routines. Let’s take “Work, home, bed” as states. From work (state), you take a bus (input) to get home (state), and when you arrive home, you go to bed (another input leading to another state). Tomorrow morning when you wake up and get out of your bed, you’re transitioning from the last state you were in into a previous one, and yet again, taking the bus from home to work is one more transition.</p>
<p>There are other, more complex examples with many more states, inputs, and transitions between them, and the more states you add, the more complex the FSM model becomes.</p>
<p>The conclusion is simple – FSMs are a method of modeling your system by defining the states and transitions between those states.</p>
<h2><span><b>What Are Step Functions?</b></span></h2>
<p>Step Functions are Amazon’s Finite-State Machines service that’s entirely managed while also being serverless. Step Functions are made of state machines (workflows) and tasks. Tasks are individual states or single units of work.</p>
<p>In the following graph, you’ll see an example of Amazon’s State Machine in which the green rectangles represent the states. The result leads to another state, which then leads to the choice that depends on the given input (email or SMS). In this example, the green states were successfully executed, while the white-colored state wasn’t.</p>
<figure id="attachment_2959" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2959"><img loading="lazy" src="https://mk0dashbirdiotlcuqbg.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screenshot-2020-10-22-at-11.24.03-1024x853.png" alt="Amazon's state machine" width="640" height="533" srcset="https://mk0dashbirdiotlcuqbg.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screenshot-2020-10-22-at-11.24.03-1024x853.png 1024w, https://mk0dashbirdiotlcuqbg.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screenshot-2020-10-22-at-11.24.03-300x250.png 300w, https://mk0dashbirdiotlcuqbg.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screenshot-2020-10-22-at-11.24.03-768x640.png 768w, https://mk0dashbirdiotlcuqbg.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screenshot-2020-10-22-at-11.24.03.png 1152w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2959"><em>Amazon’s state machine</em></figcaption></figure>

<p>This entire graph representing the state machine is also known as a Workflow, and there are two types of workflows available.</p>
<h2><span><b>Step Function Workflow</b></span></h2>
<h3><b>Types Of Workflows</b></h3>
<p>Workflows are divided into two groups: Standard and Express workflow. Unlike Standard, the Express workflow is a relatively new option that has been available since last year. The table below shows the differences between these two workflow types.</p>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>

<p><b>Workflows</b></p>

</tbody>
</table>

<p>State machines orchestrate the work of Lambda functions. When one function ends, it triggers another function to begin. Although Max Duration is significantly different, Express workflow allows more scalability. Moreover, Express workflow pricing is constructed with more details since users will have to pay for the number of executions, including the duration and memory used for those executions. Standard workflow pricing requires users to pay only for each state transition that occurs.</p>
<p>It’s important to note that Standard workflow is a long-running workflow that has to be durable and auditable. In contrast, the Express workflow type is needed for a much higher workflow and event processing volume.</p>
<h3><b>Workflow Execution</b></h3>
<p>Now that you know the basics, the next step of the way is the execution. To trigger the workflow to start the execution against Step Function API, you can use CloudWatch events as a time trigger or use API Gateway as a proxy.</p>
<h3><span><b>State Types</b></span></h3>
<p>It’s essential to remember that States aren’t the same thing as Tasks since Tasks are one of the State types. There are numerous State types, and all of them have a role to play in the overall workflow:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pass: Pushes input to output.</li>
<li>Task: Takes input and produces output.</li>
<li>Choice: Allows the user to use Branching Logic that’s based on the input.</li>
<li>Wait: It adds delays to State Machine execution.</li>
<li>Success: Has an expected dead-end that stops execution successfully.</li>
<li>Fail: Has an expected dead-end that stops execution with a failure.</li>
<li>Parallel: Allows a user to implement parallel branches in execution, meaning the user can start multiple states at once.</li>
<li>(Dynamic) Mapping: Runs a set of steps for every input item.</li>
</ul>
<h3><span><b>Tasks</b></span></h3>
<p>Tasks are the leading States in which all the work is done. Tasks can call Activities (remote executions):</p>
<ul>
<li>Call an execution on either ECS, EC2 machines, or mobile devices.</li>
<li>Sending SMS notifications and wait for the input.</li>
</ul>
<p>Another constructive element that Step Functions Tasks provide is that it allows you to reach out from your AWS space.</p>
<h3><span><b>Error Handling</b></span></h3>
<p>Error handling includes retries and catch. An excellent example of how does Step Functions work is shown in the graph below:</p>
<figure id="attachment_2960" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2960"><img loading="lazy" src="https://mk0dashbirdiotlcuqbg.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screenshot-2020-10-22-at-11.25.21-1024x882.png" alt="Step Function visual workflow" width="640" height="551" srcset="https://mk0dashbirdiotlcuqbg.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screenshot-2020-10-22-at-11.25.21-1024x882.png 1024w, https://mk0dashbirdiotlcuqbg.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screenshot-2020-10-22-at-11.25.21-300x258.png 300w, https://mk0dashbirdiotlcuqbg.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screenshot-2020-10-22-at-11.25.21-768x661.png 768w, https://mk0dashbirdiotlcuqbg.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screenshot-2020-10-22-at-11.25.21.png 1110w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2960"><em>Step Function visual workflow</em></figcaption></figure>

<p>In this example, you can see the Parallel branching task. This task is a perfect example representing how the entire execution will fail if only one state encounters an error.</p>
<p>Users are provided with Amazon State Language that helps them catch those errors and define all the retries. All this is extremely important for business-critical operations.</p>
<p>Amazon State Language allows you to place a comment, define when the state should start, and define the states and tasks. Moreover, suppose a customer handled an error. In that case, this tool allows you to specify the retries based on the error name, but also to specify the retry interval, as well as the number of retry maximum attempts, and backoff rate, which you can see in the example below:</p>
<figure id="attachment_2961" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2961"><img loading="lazy" src="https://mk0dashbirdiotlcuqbg.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screenshot-2020-10-22-at-11.23.22-1024x446.png" alt="Amazon State Language: Error handling example" width="640" height="279" srcset="https://mk0dashbirdiotlcuqbg.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screenshot-2020-10-22-at-11.23.22-1024x446.png 1024w, https://mk0dashbirdiotlcuqbg.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screenshot-2020-10-22-at-11.23.22-300x131.png 300w, https://mk0dashbirdiotlcuqbg.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screenshot-2020-10-22-at-11.23.22-768x334.png 768w, https://mk0dashbirdiotlcuqbg.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screenshot-2020-10-22-at-11.23.22.png 1162w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2961"><em>Amazon State Language: Error handling example</em></figcaption></figure>

<p>In case you wish to catch errors, you’ll see why some states weren’t executed and which tasks have failed. See an example of how to catch an error in the graph below:</p>
<figure id="attachment_2962" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2962"><img loading="lazy" src="https://mk0dashbirdiotlcuqbg.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screenshot-2020-10-22-at-11.28.06-1024x448.png" alt="Amazon State Language: Catch Errors example" width="640" height="280" srcset="https://mk0dashbirdiotlcuqbg.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screenshot-2020-10-22-at-11.28.06-1024x448.png 1024w, https://mk0dashbirdiotlcuqbg.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screenshot-2020-10-22-at-11.28.06-300x131.png 300w, https://mk0dashbirdiotlcuqbg.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screenshot-2020-10-22-at-11.28.06-768x336.png 768w, https://mk0dashbirdiotlcuqbg.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screenshot-2020-10-22-at-11.28.06.png 1166w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2962"><em>Amazon State Language: Catch Errors example</em></figcaption></figure>

<p>The first retry attempt will start at the pre-determined interval, and it gets multiplied by the backoff rate you’ve set.</p>
<p>Error handling is critical because if Parallel tasks execute successfully, but one fails, the entire execution will fail. However, even if the entire execution fails, the state changes will remain intact.</p>
<p>Error handling allows you to track everything that’s happened in the log, and by doing so, you’ll have a better insight on why some errors happened so you could handle the core problem.</p>
<h2><span><b>Step Function Demonstration</b></span></h2>
<h3><b>Choice Step Function Example</b></h3>
<p>You’ll have to input a preferred number into your function. For example, if you chose a number 10 and a customer buys more than ten items from you, the Step Function will execute successfully by following a preferred choice. In case a customer buys less than ten items, the execution will also be successful, but under a different pre-set choice.</p>
<h3><b>Retry Step Function Example</b></h3>
<p>It’s required that you specify the number of retries for all errors and define the interval, along with the number of maximum attempts. There you’ll see that it’s retrying to execute the function until it finally fails.</p>
<p>When the execution fails, you can check the logs in the Execution Event History tab to see how many times it started, but you’ll also be able to see the retries in between each start. You can access detailed information by following the CloudWatch logs link within the Event History tab.</p>
<h3><b>Catch Step Function Example</b></h3>
<p>Input a specific number range, and the function will execute based on the pre-set number. If the execution number goes outside the pre-set number range, the function will report a Range Error. However, if the number goes below the minimal pre-set number higher than zero, the function will report a Custom Error.</p>
<p>Error catch and error handling are essential for Step Functions since it allows for a successful, and error-free function execution.</p>
<h2><span><b>Step Functions Use Cases</b></span></h2>
<h3><b>When To Use Step Functions?</b></h3>
<p>Step Functions Standard workflow is excellent for business-critical workflows and brings along <a href="https://dashbird.io/knowledge-base/step-functions/why-use-step-functions/">numerous business benefits</a>. It provides much better error handling logic that Lambda Functions, while it’s relatively easy to orchestrate them. On the other hand, it’s meant more for business-critical ones since it pretty expensive compared to Express workflow. The Standard workflow price is USD$25 per one million executions with the additional cost for memory and duration of use.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text"><p>Comparing most powerful computers from 1956 to that of 2015, there's 1 trillion-fold increase in processing power.Although the technological progress has been accelerating, the human brain has not changed significantly in millenia and so some great minds have speculated that machines will surpass human levels of intelligence and ability at some point of time.</p>
<p>Machines have become really intelligent, fast, accurate and unbeatable for performing some task like playing chess, or DOTA2(the Open AI), doing complex calculations, weather forecasting and more. But the one thing that makes human special is their <em>Natural Intelligence</em>. But what if humans were able to design such intelligent system which in turn designs a new system more intelligent than itself and this cycle repeats ?</p>
<p>This will result in such an intelligence called "UltraIntelligence". There would then unquestionably be an ‘intelligence explosion’, and the intelligence of men would be left far behind. Thus the first ultraintelligent machine is the last invention that man need ever make.</p>
<p>But to be clear, nobody knows when is it going to happen, might be never or around 2500 or maybe around 2100. Maybe those prognosticators are right, and it will happen in the next thirty to eighty years.</p>
<p>Get yourself ready</p>
<p>There are another speculations however on How far along the intelligence explosion go.
Some believe that it will stop at the point that it reaches the full equivalent of human intelligence.</p>
<p>Why so? Because it is asserted that perhaps mankind exhibits the highest possible intelligence, and therefore there isn’t anything beyond it. In contrast, another viewpoint is that the AI intelligence explosion is going to zip right past human intelligence and land somewhere around so-called super-intelligence, also referred to as ultra-intelligence.</p>
<p>How high is up? Can’t say. Don’t know.</p>
<p>One belief is that this super-intelligence will undoubtedly be beyond our level of intelligence, and yet it will itself also have a boundary or final edge to it. It won’t be some amorphous intelligence that is all-consuming. Meanwhile, there are those though that suggest the AI intelligence explosion might be a never-ending chain reaction. AI intelligence might keep going and going, getting smarter and smarter, doing so for the rest of eternity.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What would it mean for mankind if the AI intelligence explosion was something that once started was ever-expanding?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This could be really good or ...really...really...bad</p>
<p>A machine superintelligence, if programmed with the right motivations, could potentially solve all the problems that humans are trying to solve but haven’t had the ingenuity or processing speed to solve yet. A superintelligence might cure disabilities and diseases, achieve world peace, give humans vastly longer and healthier lives, eliminate food and energy shortages, boost scientific discovery and space exploration, and so on.</p>
<p>Furthermore, humanity faces several existential risks in the 21st century, including global nuclear war, bioweapons, superviruses, and more.[56] A superintelligent machine would be more capable of solving those problems than humans are.</p>
<p>Sounds really cool so far right ? Now let's look at the downside</p>
<p>If programmed with the wrong motivations, a machine could be malevolent toward humans, and intentionally exterminate our species. More likely, it could be designed with motivations that initially appeared safe (and easy to program) to its designers, but that turn out to be best fulfilled (given sufficient power) by reallocating resources from sustaining human life to other projects.
 “the AI does not hate you, nor does it love you, but you are made out of atoms which it can use for something else.”, No strings attached.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Can we add friendliness to any artificial intelligence design?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Many AI designs that would generate an intelligence explosion would not have a ‘slot’ in which a goal (such as ‘be friendly to human interests’) could be placed. For example, if AI is made via whole brain emulation, or evolutionary algorithms, or neural nets, or reinforcement learning, the AI will end up with some goal as it self-improves, but that stable eventual goal may be very difficult to predict in advance.</p>
<p>Thus, in order to design a friendly AI, it is not sufficient to determine what ‘friendliness’ is (and to specify it clearly enough that even a superintelligence will interpret it the way we want it to). We must also figure out how to build a general intelligence that satisfies a goal at all, and that stably retains that goal as it edits its own code to make itself smarter. This task is perhaps the primary difficulty in designing friendly AI.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Can we teach a superintelligence a moral code with machine learning?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Some have proposed that  we teach machines a moral code with case-based machine learning. The basic idea is this: Human judges would rate thousands of actions, character traits, desires, laws, or institutions as having varying degrees of moral acceptability. The machine would then find the connections between these cases and learn the principles behind morality, such that it could apply those principles to determine the morality of new cases not encountered during its training. This kind of machine learning has already been used to design machines that can, for example, detect underwater mines after feeding the machine hundreds of cases of mines and not-mines.</p>
<p>There are several reasons machine learning does not present an easy solution for Friendly AI. The first is that, of course, humans themselves hold deep disagreements about what is moral and immoral. But even if humans could be made to agree on all the training cases, at least two problems remain.</p>
<p>The first problem is that training on cases from our present reality may not result in a machine that will make correct ethical decisions in a world radically reshaped by superintelligence.</p>
<p>The second problem is that a superintelligence may generalize the wrong principles due to coincidental patterns in the training data.Consider the parable of the machine trained to recognize camouflaged tanks in a forest. Researchers take 100 photos of camouflaged tanks and 100 photos of trees. They then train the machine on 50 photos of each, so that it learns to distinguish camouflaged tanks from trees. As a test, they show the machine the remaining 50 photos of each, and it classifies each one correctly. Success! However, later tests show that the machine classifies additional photos of camouflaged tanks and trees poorly. The problem turns out to be that the researchers’ photos of camouflaged tanks had been taken on cloudy days, while their photos of trees had been taken on sunny days. The machine had learned to distinguish cloudy days from sunny days, not camouflaged tanks from trees.</p>
<p>Thus, it seems that trustworthy Friendly AI design must involve detailed models of the underlying processes generating human moral judgments, not only surface similarities of cases.</p>

<![CDATA[Cleaning $HOME on macOS]]>

October 24, 2020 | http://karolis.koncevicius.lt/posts/cleaning_home_on_macos/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/http://karolis.koncevicius.lt/posts/cleaning_home_on_macos/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page">




<p>Apple computers ship with a custom operating system - macOS, which has a few annoying features.
Among the annoyances a special place has to be reserved for the inability to remove or rename the folders located in <code>$HOME</code>.
Here I describe my way of dealing with this problem.</p>

<h2 id="hidingdefaultfolders">Hiding default folders</h2>

<p>On the web countless macOS users are looking for answers to the same question: “How can I get rid of ‘Desktop’, ‘Documents’, ‘Downloads’, ‘Library’, ‘Movies’, ‘Music’, ‘Pictures’, and ‘Public’ folders?”
Multiple suggestions are provided as possible solutions.
You can: replace the folders with files<a href="#fn:1" id="fnref:1" title="see footnote"><sup>○</sup></a>; hide the folders from ‘Finder’ and make them inaccessible<a href="#fn:2" id="fnref:2" title="see footnote"><sup>○</sup></a>; or simply learn to live with them, as the system will recreate those folders by itself anyway<a href="#fn:3" id="fnref:3" title="see footnote"><sup>○</sup></a>.</p>

<p>I decided to hide.
But, when working in the command line, hiding these folders from Finder is not enough.
Below are three settings that, while not covering all corner cases, go a long way.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>hide from <code>Finder</code> by adding a hidden flag</p>

<pre><code>chflags hidden ~/Desktop ~/Documents ~/Downloads ~/Library
chflags hidden ~/Movies ~/Music ~/Pictures ~/Public
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>hide from <code>ls</code> by creating an alias in <code>.bashrc</code></p>

<pre><code>alias ls='ls -I Desktop -I Documents -I Downloads -I Library\
             -I Movies -I Music -I Pictures -I Public'
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>hide from tab completion by setting a special bash <code>FIGNORE</code><a href="#fn:4" id="fnref:4" title="see footnote"><sup>○</sup></a> variable.</p>

<pre><code>export FIGNORE=Desktop:Documents:Downloads:Library:Movies:Music:Pictures:Public
</code></pre></li>
</ol>

<p>That is it, the folders should mostly be out of view.
And if for whatever reason we need to temporary see them again a simple <code>\ls</code> would bypass the alias and provide us the full list.</p>

<h2 id="creatinganewhierarchy">Creating a new hierarchy</h2>

<p>With the folders out of view we can now move onto creating our own home hierarchy.
This part mostly depends on the needs of the user.
But I would like to offer one piece of advice: make sure your folders start with unique lowercase letters.
This will allow you to auto-complete folder names after typing a single character and offer extra protection against invoking a command on one of those default hidden folders, that start with upper case letters.</p>

<p>In my case the new hierarchy looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>├── base
│   ├─── bin
│   ├─── etc
│   ├─── src
│   └─── var
│
├── desk
│
├── file
│   ├─── articles
│   ├─── books
│   ├─── documents
│   ├─── essays
│   ├─── photos
│   └─── videos
│
└── work
    ├─── active_project_one
    ├─── active_project_two
    └─── zzz
         ├─── inactive_project_one
         ├─── inactive_project_two
         ├─── inactive_project_three
         ├─── inactive_project_four
         └─── ...
</code></pre>

<p><code>'base'</code> is a substitute for <code>'.local'</code>.<br>
<code>'desk'</code> takes the place of the <code>'Desktop'</code> and <code>'Downloads'</code>.<br>
<code>'file'</code> is an aggregate of <code>'Documents'</code>, <code>'Music'</code>, <code>'Pictures'</code>, and <code>'Movies'</code>.<br>
<code>'work'</code> stores various active and completed projects.</p>

<h2 id="linkingdownloadsanddesktop">Linking Downloads and Desktop</h2>

<p>There is one detail remaining: macOS has a useful <code>'Desktop'</code> and now its hidden from us.
On top of that some third party applications put various acquired data into the <code>'Downloads'</code> folder.
Hence, we want to see the contents of those folders within our new file hierarchy.
We achieve this with symbolic links.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>make <code>'Desktop'</code> be a symbolic link for our new folder <code>'desk'</code></p>

<pre><code>sudo rm -rf Desktop
ln -s desk Desktop
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>make <code>'Downloads'</code> be a symbolic link for <code>'Desktop'</code></p>

<pre><code>sudo rm -rf Downloads
ln -s Desktop Downloads
</code></pre></li>
</ol>

<p>And now whenever a file is put into the, now hidden, <code>'Downloads'</code> or <code>'Desktop'</code> folders, it will be placed in our <code>'desk'</code> instead.
Moreover, since <code>'Desktop'</code> is a link to <code>'desk'</code>, whatever is put into the <code>'desk'</code> directory will be visible on the actual desktop on a screen.</p>

<h2 id="theresult">The result</h2>

<pre><code>$ ls ~/
base desk file work

$ cd ~/D&lt;tab&gt;
$ cd ~/D

$ cd ~/d&lt;tab&gt;
$ cd ~/desk
</code></pre>

<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>

<p>Getting rid of default macOS home directories is hard.
Hiding, instead of trying to delete, seems like an easier and safer solution.
The tricks presented in this article, while not being 100% effective, go along way.
I’ve been using this approach for a few years without accidentally seeing any reminder of those folders during this whole time.</p>

<p>TL;DR: <em>If you aren’t using <a href="https://apps.ankiweb.net/">Anki</a> or one of its siblings to remember what you learn, you are missing out on literal superpowers. There are specific techniques which I’ve found helpful for using it to learn maths and computer science in particular.</em></p>
<p>This post will discuss extremely briefly what Anki is, but is mainly aimed at helping the student of maths or computer science to squeeze out some extra droplets of productivity from it. If you aren’t already familiar with Anki, go and read Michael Nielsen’s post <a href="http://augmentingcognition.com/ltm.html">Augmenting Long-Term Memory</a> as well or instead of this one; if you’re short of time, the main value of the post to someone new to Anki is in the first one-eighth or so, up to but not including “Using Anki to thoroughly read a research paper in an unfamiliar field”. That essay gives a broad-strokes motivation for why one might want to use Anki at all. (Spoiler: it gives you a superhuman memory!)</p>
<h2 id="what-is-anki-">What is Anki?</h2>
<p><a href="https://apps.ankiweb.net/">Anki</a> is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition">spaced repetition system</a>: essentially a program that shows you flashcards at intervals tailored to help you remember their contents. Such systems are based on the observation that while you can’t stop memories from decaying, repeated exposure makes the decay exponentially slower.</p>
<p>So while you need to rehearse a fact frequently when you first come to learn it, reviews can become very sparse very quickly without losing much of your hard-won memory.</p>
<p>Anki is only one such system; other implementations such as SuperMemo and Mnemosyne exist.<br>
There are also applications using the same principles for more specific goals; for example, Memrise is designed for language learning. This post is phrased in terms of Anki, because for historical reasons that’s the one I use.</p>

<p>I’ve placed this section at the start, because I believe that spaced repetition is genuinely a superpower that anyone can acquire. If I can’t hold your interest in this post, I encourage you to glance over these other resources in the hope that one of them does the trick!</p>

(Note that some of its cards are not ideal; the site does sometimes fall into the “yes/no” pattern, with flashcards whose answer is a bald “yes” or “no”. Cards of this form aren’t as good as cards which get you to reproduce actually content-based parts of a fact.)</li>
<li><a href="https://www.supermemo.com/en/archives1990-2015/articles/20rules">The Twenty Rules of Formulating Knowledge in Learning</a> – the creator of the spaced-repetition system SuperMemo discusses how to formulate knowledge so that it sticks. Again, even if you don’t use spaced repetition, definitely read this; the advice is absolutely foundational to my understanding of how to learn. A nontrivial amount of this very blog post is essentially specialising some of these rules to the case of maths and computer science.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/medicalschoolanki/">Reddit: Medical School Anki</a>, a subreddit with almost 55,000 subscribers at the time of writing. This link is here just to demonstrate that there are fields (such as medicine) in which Anki is very popular and nowhere near as niche as it is in most areas.</li>
</ul>

<p>Absolutely crucial to the effective use of Anki for even a moderate collection of cards is that answering a card should be a single mental motion.</p>
<p>What does this mean? We’ll demonstrate with some positive and negative examples.</p>
<ul>
<li>“What is the capital of France?” is probably answered with a single mental motion: it’s just “Paris”, obtained by a simple lookup in your memory.</li>
<li>“What is 367 times 399?” is many mental motions unless you are really unusually good at mental arithmetic. Almost everyone has to carry out some algorithm to get an answer to this question.</li>
<li>“What is the composition of air?” is probably many mental motions: for example, a lookup of “which gases are in air?” and a number of motions like “what proportion of air is this specific gas?”. Or it could be the various mental motions of “Which gas is the nth most common in air, and what is its proportion in air?” as n varies.</li>
<li>“What is the most common gas in air, and what is its proportion?” is very possibly a single mental motion despite the multiple components in its answer. For me, the knowledge that “nitrogen is the most common gas in air” is intimately bound up with “78% of air is nitrogen”; to answer one question is to access the same mental lump of storage as is required to answer the other question. Of course, for someone else, this may be two distinct facts and two distinct memory lookups.</li>
</ul>
<p>A card that is answered with one mental motion may be multiple motions for someone else; and a question answered with many mental motions may become one motion after you learn some additional fact or part of the model that ties the facts together. So it’s helpful if you personally keep track of what you’re doing to answer a given card, so that you can recognise some of this structure in your own mind.</p>
<p>Any card which is multiple mental motions should be broken down into smaller chunks.</p>
<p>If you’re doing too much work to answer a card, it’s important to notice, so that you can break the card down. And don’t worry that you might “break down a card too much”; if the cards are easy, Anki will exponentially decrease how often it shows them to you. The cost of creating a card that’s too easy is almost entirely in the time it takes you to create the card in the first place; a card that’s too difficult will sap your time and energy again and again.</p>

<p>As an example, recall the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio_test">ratio test for convergence</a>, likely to be covered in any first course in analysis:</p>
<p><em>Let$\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} a_n$ be a complex series, with each $a_i$ nonzero.<br>
Suppose that there is $a$ such that $|\frac{a_{n+1}}{a_n}| \to a$.<br>
Then, if $a &lt; 1$ then the series converges absolutely; if $a &gt; 1$ then the series diverges.</em></p>
<p>(We’ll discuss its proof in a later section.)</p>
<p>This statement has a number of moving parts, and is definitely much too large to appear as a single card. (Remember the rule of thumb: answering a single card should be a single mental motion.)<br>
How could we formulate this statement in an Anki-friendly way?</p>
<p>My own personal Anki collection contains the following cards. (Anki does allow LaTeX, though I often optimise for speed of card creation and just use plain text, however ugly it ends up. As long as it’s easily legible, it doesn’t need to be pretty.)</p>
<ul>
<li>What conditions exist on the ratio test? (answer: nonzero, sequence of ratios has a limit)</li>
<li>When does the ratio test let us conclude something? (answer: successive ratios converge to something not equal to 1)</li>
<li>Which cases exist on the ratio test? (answer: ratios converge to less than, or greater than, 1)</li>
<li>What can we say from the ratio test if the ratios converge to something less than 1? (answer: converges absolutely)</li>
<li>What can we say from the ratio test if the ratios converge to something greater than 1? (answer: diverges)</li>
<li>What can we say from the ratio test if the ratios converge to 1? (answer: nothing)</li>
<li>Give an example where the ratio test is inconclusive. (answer: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harmonic_series_(mathematics)">harmonic series</a>)</li>
</ul>
<p>All these cards are very simple; perhaps they might look laughably simple. This is fine! Remember that Anki will rapidly stop showing you cards you already know. Crucially each card is really a single mental motion to answer.</p>
<p>Note also that information is duplicated between cards. For example, there are two cards saying in slightly different ways that the ratio test talks about when successive ratios converge to something not equal to 1. Again, it’s fine to repeat information, because cards are cheap. Here, the information is duplicated to better facilitate the links between the cards: one card is a general “when can we conclude anything”, and one card is the same information rephrased as “which cases do I need to consider to produce more information here”. Without the additional rephrasing, there’s more of a risk of developing “isolated” clusters of cards; the aim is that given just the prompt “ratio test”, I can reproduce the <em>entire</em> cluster without thinking any further.</p>
<p>And don’t forget to store key examples and counterexamples!</p>

<p>Remembering a definition is rather like remembering the statement of a theorem.<br>
Without further ado, here is my definition of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red-black_tree">red-black tree</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>What, imprecisely, are the colouring rules on a red-black tree? (“global; local; base-case”)</li>
<li>What are the leaves of a red-black tree? (“null, black”)</li>
<li>What is the base-case colouring rule of a red-black tree? (“leaves are black”)</li>
<li>What is the local colouring rule of a red-black tree? (“red node =&gt; black children”)</li>
<li>What is the global colouring rule of a red-black tree? (“black depth is well defined”)</li>
<li>What is the black depth of a node in a red-black tree? (“the number of black nodes encountered on a path from that node down to a leaf”)</li>
</ul>
<p>Again, there is some duplication (two cards note that the leaves of a red-black tree are coloured black), and all the cards are extremely simple. The point is to make sure not only that the actual <em>content</em> is remembered, but also that the content is interlinked enough that you can reproduce the entire definition from the single prompt “red-black tree”. Moreover, one card is explicitly structural and carries no actual content as such: the card that lists the three types of colouring rule. This card is there solely to allow me to remember which <em>cards</em> are relevant.</p>
<p>Naively, one might create instead a single card, “what is a red-black tree?”. But in my experience, this is too big. If you’re reviewing even 30 cards a day, and …</p></div></div></div>

October 24, 2020 | https://rust-analyzer.github.io//blog/2020/10/24/introducing-ungrammar.html | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://rust-analyzer.github.io//blog/2020/10/24/introducing-ungrammar.html">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>So, what exactly does “describing syntax trees” mean and why is it useful?
When writing an IDE, one of the core data structure is the concrete syntax tree.
It is a full-fidelity tree which represents the original source code in detail, including parenthesis, comments, and whitespace.
CSTs are used for initial analysis of the language.
They are also a vocabulary type for refactors.
Although the ultimate result of a refactor is a text diff, tree modification is a more convenient internal representation.</p>

<p>At the lowest level, the CST is typically unityped: there’s some <code>Node</code> superclass, which has a collection of <code>Node</code> children and an optional <code>Node</code> parent.
On top of this raw layer, a more AST-like API is provided: <code>Struct</code> has a <code>.name()</code> and a list of <code>.fields()</code>, etc.
This typed API is huge!
For rust-analyzer, it is comprised of more than 130 <em>types</em>!
And it is also more detailed than a typical AST: <code>Struct</code> also has <code>.l_curly()</code> and <code>.r_curly()</code>.</p>
<p>What’s worse, this API changes a lot, especially at the beginning.
You may start with nesting <code>.fields()</code> directly under the <code>Struct</code>, but then introduce a <code>StructFields</code> node for everything between the curly braces to share the code with enum variants.</p>
<p>In short, writing this by hand sucks :-)
Ungrammar is a notation to concisely describe the structure of the syntax tree, which can be used by a code generator to build an API in the target language.
If you’ve heard about <a href="https://www.oilshell.org/blog/2016/12/11.html">ASDL</a>, ungrammar is ASDL for concrete syntax trees.
For rust-analyzer’s case, that means taking the following input:</p>
<div>
<div>
<pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
3
4
</pre></td><td><pre>Module =
  Attr* Visibility?
  'mod' Name
  (ItemList | ';')
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>And generating the following output:</p>
<div>
<div>
<pre><code data-lang="rust"><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
</pre></td><td><pre><span>impl</span> <span>ast</span><span>::</span><span>AttrsOwner</span>      <span>for</span> <span>Module</span> <span>{}</span>
<span>impl</span> <span>ast</span><span>::</span><span>VisibilityOwner</span> <span>for</span> <span>Module</span> <span>{}</span>
<span>impl</span> <span>ast</span><span>::</span><span>NameOwner</span>       <span>for</span> <span>Module</span> <span>{}</span>
<span>impl</span> <span>Module</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>pub</span> <span>fn</span> <span>mod_token</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>self</span><span>)</span>       <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Option</span><span>&lt;</span><span>SyntaxToken</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>{</span> <span>...</span> <span>}</span>
    <span>pub</span> <span>fn</span> <span>item_list</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>self</span><span>)</span>       <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Option</span><span>&lt;</span><span>ItemList</span><span>&gt;</span>    <span>{</span> <span>...</span> <span>}</span>
    <span>pub</span> <span>fn</span> <span>semicolon_token</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>self</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Option</span><span>&lt;</span><span>SyntaxToken</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>{</span> <span>...</span> <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>In typical parser generators, something similar can be achieved by generating <em>both</em> the parser and the syntax tree from the same grammar.
This works to some extent, but has an inherent problem that the shape of the tree you want for the programmatic API, and the shape of the grammar you need to implement the parser are often different.
“Technical” transformations like left-recursion elimination don’t affect the language described by the grammar, but completely change the shape of the parse tree.
In contrast, ungrammar focuses solely on the second task, which radically reduces the complexity of the grammar.
In rust-analyzer, it is paired with a hand-written parser.</p>
<p>Treated as an ordinary (context free) grammar, ungrammar describes a superset of the language.
For example, for programmatic API it might be convenient to treat commas in comma-separate lists as a part of the list element
(rust-analyzer doesn’t do this yet, but it should).
This leads to the following ungrammar, which obviously doesn’t treat commas precisely:</p>
<div>
<div>
<pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
3
4
5
</pre></td><td><pre>FieldList =
  '{' Field* '}'

Field:
  Name ':' Type ','?
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>Similarly, ungrammar defines binary and unary expressions, but doesn’t specify their relative precedence and associativity.</p>
<p>An interesting side-effect is that the resulting grammars turn out to be pretty human readable.
For example, a full production ready Rust grammar takes about 600 short lines:<br></p>

<p>This might be a good fit for reference documentation!</p>

                <div>
                    <h2 id="1-what-s-new">1/ What's new?</h2><p>The list of changes and improvements is long, check the <a href="https://github.com/composer/composer/releases/tag/2.0.0">complete changelog</a> if you are interested in reading it all. I will highlight a few key points here.</p><h3 id="performance-improvements">Performance improvements</h3><p>We overhauled pretty much everything from the protocol used between Composer and packagist.org to the dependency resolution, including downloading files in parallel using curl and constraint evaluation optimizations. This leads to massive improvements in terms of both speed and memory usage. The difference depends on your use case, so while I've seen reports of improvements of over 50% to both in some projects, I cannot put an exact number on it. But I am sure you will be positively surprised if you haven't tried Composer 2 yet.</p><p>As a side note to this, <code>require</code>/<code>remove</code> and partial updates are now much faster because Composer will now only load the metadata of the packages which are being changed.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.packagist.com/content/images/2020/10/image_2020-10-24_175318.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.packagist.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/10/image_2020-10-24_175318.png 600w, https://blog.packagist.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/10/image_2020-10-24_175318.png 1000w, https://blog.packagist.com/content/images/2020/10/image_2020-10-24_175318.png 1455w" sizes="(min-width: 1200px) 1200px"><figcaption>Time for initial update + install (bootstrapped project, empty cache) shows roughly 60% less time used by Composer 2 with ext-curl enabled</figcaption></figure><h3 id="architectural-changes-and-determinism">Architectural changes and determinism</h3><p>The way dependency updates are done internally was refactored, which, for you, will result in more deterministic updates. The current local state of the vendor directory will not interfere in updates anymore. </p><p>After an update is complete, the install process is run automatically and it will now execute all network bound operations first - and in parallel if possible. This will avoid leaving you with a half-updated vendor directory if a network error occurs midway through installation.</p><h3 id="runtime-features">Runtime features</h3><p>We added a <a href="https://getcomposer.org/doc/07-runtime.md#platform-check">platform-check step</a> when <code>vendor/autoload.php</code> gets initialized which checks the current PHP version/extensions match what is expected by your dependencies and fails hard otherwise.</p><p>There is a new class, <code>Composer\InstalledVersions</code>, which is autoloaded in every project and is available at runtime. It allows you to check which packages/versions are present at runtime of your own project.</p><p>See the <a href="https://getcomposer.org/doc/07-runtime.md">runtime docs</a> for more details.</p><p>If your code relies on any of these runtime features, you should require <code>"composer-runtime-api": "^2.0"</code> in your composer.json. This is a virtual package which is provided by Composer and will make sure people have to use Composer 2.x to install your package.</p><h3 id="error-reporting-improvements">Error reporting improvements</h3><p>Because things don't always go the way they're supposed to, we made sure to improve the error reporting shown to you when dependencies cannot be resolved. It's hard to give concrete examples here as there are a million ways this can fail but you will hopefully notice that messages are now shorter, clearer and less repetitive.</p><h3 id="partial-updates-with-temporary-constraints">Partial updates with temporary constraints</h3><p>Sometimes it can be useful to upgrade or downgrade a single package to a specific version, perhaps temporarily to test something or wait for a bug fix. You can now run <code>composer update vendor/package:1.0.*</code> for example (or <code>1.0.12</code> or any other version constraint), to run an update of only <code>vendor/package</code> to a version matching this additional constraint. This will not update your require in composer.json, and it will not mark the lock file out of date.</p><p>If you want to add/restrict a constraint but still do a full update of all dependencies, you can use <code>update --with vendor/package:1.0.*</code> which will run the update with that additional constraint.</p><h2 id="2-how-easy-is-it-to-upgrade">2/ How easy is it to upgrade?</h2><p>Our goal is that every Composer user can upgrade smoothly and swiftly. The gains are huge and we want everyone to benefit from them. To achieve that we did a few things:</p><ul><li>Composer 2.0 still supports PHP 5.3 and above, much like Composer 1.x</li><li><code>composer.lock</code> files are interoperable between versions, so you can upgrade to 2.0 and roll back easily if needed.</li><li>Most commands and arguments remain the same, and largely what you know about Composer remains true in 2.0.</li></ul><p>If you run <code>composer self-update</code> from 1.x, it will warn you that a new stable major version of Composer is available, and you can use <code>composer self-update --2</code> to migrate to it.</p><p>Should you encounter issues, you can go back at any time by using <code>composer self-update --1</code>. Hopefully that will make everyone feel comfortable to experiment with the new release.</p><p>If you are <a href="https://getcomposer.org/doc/faqs/how-to-install-composer-programmatically.md">installing Composer automatically</a> from the installer script, and wish to remain on Composer 1.x for the time being, you can also pass it a <code>--1</code> argument to prevent it from installing Composer 2.0 by default. If you do this please remember and aim to upgrade in a timely manner, as Composer 1.x will not be maintained for very long.</p><h2 id="3-backwards-compatibility-breaks">3/ Backwards compatibility breaks?</h2><p>Here are the main things likely to cause trouble with the upgrade process:</p><ul><li><strong>Plugins</strong>: This is probably going to be the major source of problems for most people. Plugins need to be updated to support Composer 2, and some of them are not ready, yet. Composer 2 will complain and fail to resolve dependencies if a plugin does not support it, so no need to overthink it, you can try it out and see how it goes.</li><li>The new <strong>platform-check feature</strong> means that Composer checks the runtime PHP version and available extensions to ensure they match the project dependencies. If a mismatch is found, the autoloader exits with error details to make sure problems are not overlooked. To avoid issues when deploying to production it is recommended to run <code>composer check-platform-reqs --no-dev</code> with the production PHP process as part of your build or deployment process.</li><li><strong>Repository priority</strong>: If a package exists in a higher priority repository, it will now be entirely ignored in lower priority repositories. If you seem to be missing packages when using Composer 2, see <a href="https://getcomposer.org/repoprio">repository priorities docs</a> for details.</li><li><strong>Invalid PSR-0 / PSR-4 configurations</strong> will not autoload anymore in optimized-autoloader mode, as per the warnings introduced in Composer 1.10. Mostly these warnings were for classes that were not meant to autoload anyway so I don't expect major issues, but it's safer to clean these up before upgrading.</li></ul><p>If you want to know more, I would highly recommend reading the <a href="https://github.com/composer/composer/blob/master/UPGRADE-2.0.md">UPGRADE</a> guide which has multiple sections for end users, plugin authors and Composer repository implementors.</p><h2 id="4-what-s-next">4/ What's next?</h2><p>We don't have a very detailed feature roadmap anymore as 2.0 contains tons of new goodies, but one important thing I want to explain is our PHP version support going forward.</p><p>As I mentioned above, Composer 2.0 supports PHP 5.3+, which is at this point very outdated and makes the code quite hard to maintain in places. We went through the effort to make sure every Composer user can upgrade to Composer 2, but the plan is to drop support for EOL PHP versions in a future minor release.</p><p>Composer 2.1 might still come with PHP 5.3 support, depending on the timeline and which features end up being included, but then at the latest by Composer 2.2 we will drop support for everything older than PHP 7.1.3. According to our stats this allows over 90% of the Composer users to use the latest version, and for the others who are stuck on outdated PHP versions we will keep providing critical bug and security fixes in the 2.0.x or 2.1.x range.</p><p>As for Composer 1.x, it is now more or less EOL. It will also receive critical fixes if anything comes up but the goal for everyone should be to migrate to 2.x as soon as possible.</p><p>Finally I want to thank everyone who contributed and helped make this a reality. The 2.0 release represents over 1100 commits from 28 people, 150+ GitHub issues and pull requests, plus everyone who test it, reviewed PRs, etc. It has been a huge effort with the first commits made about two years ago.</p><p>I also want to thank all our <a href="https://packagist.com/">Private Packagist</a> customers who helped finance this effort and afforded us the time we spent on all this. We sincerely hope everyone will appreciate the result!</p>

<p>The use-cases for <a href="https://blog.alexellis.io/introducing-functions-as-a-service/">Serverless / FaaS are fairly well-known</a>, but you could use faasd at the edge, in a smart-car, as part of an IoT device, for crunching data before uploading samples to the cloud, for webhook receivers/alerting, bots, webservices, API integrations or even providing your own APIs. Compute is compute, and OpenFaaS with containerd makes it easy to both consume and provide.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>🚀 Support the development of faasd - <a href="https://github.com/sponsors/openfaas">Sponsor OpenFaaS on GitHub</a><br>
⭐️ Star or fork <a href="https://github.com/openfaas/faasd">faasd on GitHub</a></p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="beforewestart">Before we start</h2>
<p>Use Raspbian Lite (now called RaspiOS) for this tutorial. Do not install Docker on the same Raspberry Pi as it may cause conflicts with networking and the version of containerd we are using.</p>
<p>You should use RPi 2, 3 or 4. If you have only one Raspberry Pi, then you'll be able to deploy pre-built images from the OpenFaaS Function Store, but if you have a second Raspberry Pi, then you can use it to build new functions too.</p>
<p>You can also deploy to a PC or cloud VM:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.openfaas.com/blog/faasd-tls-terraform/">Deploy faasd to DigitalOcean with Terraform</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/openfaas/faasd/blob/master/docs/MULTIPASS.md">Deploy faasd to your laptop with Multipass</a></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="installation">Installation</h2>
<p>Installation only takes a few moments, and in the future should be quicker if we can secure binaries for containerd from the upstream project.</p>
<h3 id="getfaascli">Get <code>faas-cli</code></h3>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/openfaas/faas-cli/">faas-cli</a> can be used to build, deploy, manage, and invoke functions with OpenFaaS. OpenFaaS offers a REST API, asynchronous invocations, authentication, metrics, and a UI out of the box.</p>
<p>Install using the utility script, or alternatively the binaries are also available on the <a href="https://github.com/openfaas/faas-cli/releases">releases page</a>.</p>
<pre><code># Install to local directory
curl -sLfS https://cli.openfaas.com | sh
sudo mv faas-cli to /usr/local/bin

# Or run with sudo to move to /usr/local/bin in one step
curl -sLfS https://cli.openfaas.com | sudo sh
</code></pre>
<p>See also: <a href="https://docs.openfaas.com/">OpenFaaS docs</a></p>
<h3 id="getcontainerd">Get containerd</h3>
<p>Unfortunately the <a href="https://github.com/containerd/containerd">containerd</a> maintainers only provide binaries for <code>x86_64</code> (regular PCs), so we have to install Go and build containerd from source.</p>
<p>We'll install some dependencies that will help us in the tutorial and after installation</p>
<pre><code>sudo apt update \
  &amp;&amp; sudo apt install -qy \
    runc \
    bridge-utils \
    tmux \
    git
</code></pre>
<p>Pick option A or B.</p>
<h4 id="ausemycontainerdarmhfbinariesfast">A) Use my containerd armhf binaries (fast)</h4>
<p>I have compiled binaries for containerd, which you can use if you wish. <a href="https://github.com/alexellis/containerd-armhf/releases">alexellis/containerd/armhf</a>.</p>
<pre><code>curl -sSL https://github.com/alexellis/containerd-arm/releases/download/v1.3.5/containerd-1.3.5-linux-armhf.tar.gz | sudo tar -xvz --strip-components=1 -C /usr/local/bin/
</code></pre>
<h4 id="bbuildyourowncontainerdbinariesslow">B) Build your own containerd binaries (slow)</h4>
<p>Raspbian needs a few additional build-time dependencies for containerd:</p>
<pre><code>sudo apt update \
  &amp;&amp; sudo apt install -qy \
    build-essential \
    libbtrfs-dev \
    libseccomp-dev
</code></pre>
<p>You can use my utility script to build containerd now:</p>
<pre><code>export GOPATH=$HOME/go/
mkdir $GOPATH/src/github.com/openfaas
cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/openfaas
git clone https://github.com/openfaas/faasd

cd cd faasd

./hack/build-containerd-armhf.sh
</code></pre>
<p>This could take a few moments on RPi2 or 3, and is a little quicker on RPi4.</p>
<h3 id="configurecontainerdtostartonboot">Configure containerd to start on boot</h3>
<p>Install a systemd unit file for <code>containerd</code>:</p>
<pre><code>curl -SLfs https://raw.githubusercontent.com/containerd/containerd/v1.3.5/containerd.service | sudo tee /etc/systemd/system/containerd.service

sudo systemctl enable containerd
sudo systemctl start containerd
</code></pre>
<p>Check that <code>containerd</code> started with <code>sudo systemctl status containerd</code>, if not then you may need to <code>unmask</code> it and run the commands again. See <a href="https://blog.ruanbekker.com/blog/2017/12/09/unmask-a-masked-service-in-systemd/">unmasking a service</a>.</p>
<h3 id="installnetworking">Install networking</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Enable the Kernel's bridge module</p>
<pre><code># One-off
sudo modprobe br_netfilter &amp;&amp; \
sudo sysctl net.bridge.bridge-nf-call-iptables=1

# Make it permanent
echo "br_netfilter" | sudo tee -a /etc/modules-load.d/modules.conf

echo "net.bridge.bridge-nf-call-iptables=1" | sudo tee -a /etc/sysctl.conf
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p>Install CNI plugins</p>
<p>Fortunately there are upstream ARM binaries available for the CNI plugins.</p>
<pre><code>sudo mkdir -p /opt/cni/bin

curl -sSL https://github.com/containernetworking/plugins/releases/download/v0.8.5/cni-plugins-linux-arm-v0.8.5.tgz | sudo tar -xz -C /opt/cni/bin
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p>Enable NAT</p>
<p>Enable NAT between the container network and your wider network and the Internet:</p>
<pre><code>sudo /sbin/sysctl -w net.ipv4.conf.all.forwarding=1

echo "net.ipv4.conf.all.forwarding=1" | sudo tee -a /etc/sysctl.conf
</code></pre>
<p>Optional step - if you have Docker running on your system, then disable it and reboot at this point.</p>
<pre><code>sudo systemctl disable docker
sudo systemctl disable docker.sock # or docker.socket - You may also need this step
</code></pre>
<p>Docker's IP address range conflicts with the one chosen by netns, this will be resolved when moving to CNI.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="getfaasd">Get <code>faasd</code></h3>
<p>faasd is a Go binary that runs on your system and packages all of OpenFaaS, it's a similar tool to docker-compose.</p>
<p>One of faasd's commands <code>faasd provider</code> runs an OpenFaaS provider which implements the OpenFaaS "CRUD" API for functions.</p>
<p>Clean-up old versions, if required:</p>
<pre><code># Stop systemd services, if you have them
sudo systemctl stop faasd
sudo systemctl stop faasd-provider

# Remove old binaries if you have them
sudo rm -rf /usr/local/bin/faasd
</code></pre>
<p>Download the faasd binary:</p>
<pre><code>sudo curl -sSLf "https://github.com/openfaas/faasd/releases/download/0.9.5/faasd-armhf" \
    --output "/usr/local/bin/faasd" \
    &amp;&amp; sudo chmod a+x "/usr/local/bin/faasd"
</code></pre>
<p>Now run the installation:</p>
<pre><code>export GOPATH=$HOME/go/
mkdir -p $GOPATH/src/github.com/openfaas
cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/openfaas

git clone https://github.com/openfaas/faasd --depth=1

cd faasd

sudo faasd install
</code></pre>
<h2 id="postinstall">Post-install</h2>
<p>The <code>faasd install</code> command creates two systemd unit files which can be used to start/stop <code>faasd</code> and <code>faasd-provider</code>.</p>
<h3 id="checktheinstallation">Check the installation</h3>
<p>Check the services:</p>
<pre><code>sudo systemctl status faasd
sudo systemctl status faasd-provider
</code></pre>
<p>Find logs:</p>
<pre><code>sudo journalctl -u faasd --lines 40
sudo journalctl -u faasd-provider --lines 40
</code></pre>
<p>You'll find your login details for the gateway in <code>/var/lib/faasd/secrets</code>, the user is <code>admin</code> and the password is in <code>/var/lib/faasd/secrets/basic-auth-password</code></p>
<h3 id="checkthelogsfromtheopenfaascoreservices">Check the logs from the OpenFaaS Core Services</h3>
<p>You can access the logs from any of the core services deployed with faasd as follows:</p>
<pre><code>sudo journalctl -t default:gateway --lines 40
sudo journalctl -t default:nats --lines 40
sudo journalctl -t default:queue-worker --lines 40
sudo journalctl -t default:prometheus --lines 40
</code></pre>
<p>For more, see the <code>docker-compose.yaml</code> file in the current directory.</p>
<h3 id="accessopenfaasfromyourlaptop">Access OpenFaaS from your laptop</h3>
<p>faasd deploys OpenFaaS along with its core logic <code>faasd-provider</code>, which uses containerd instead of Kubernetes to start, stop, and manage functions.</p>
<p>The <code>faasd</code> process will proxy any incoming requests on HTTP port 8080 to the OpenFaaS gateway container, you can also find the IP of the container in your <code>hosts</code> file in the <code>faasd</code> directory.</p>
<p>You can also access the built-in Prometheus container by editing <code>docker-compose.yaml</code> to expose its ports, either to 127.0.0.1, or all your network adapters.</p>
<h3 id="deployafunctionfromthestore">Deploy a function from the store</h3>
<p>Obtain your OpenFaaS password. You need to run this command on your Raspberry Pi:</p>
<pre><code>sudo cat /var/lib/faasd/secrets/basic-auth-password
</code></pre>
<p>Log in to the gateway, either on your RPi, or from your own computer.</p>
<pre><code># If connecting remotely
export IP=192.168.0.101
export OPENFAAS_URL=http://$IP:8080
echo $PASSWORD | faas-cli login

# Or on device:

sudo cat /var/lib/faasd/secrets/basic-auth-password | faas-cli login --password-stdin
</code></pre>
<p>Look at what's available in the function store for the armhf platform, then deploy something:</p>
<pre><code>faas-cli store list --platform armhf

# Deploy figlet
faas-cli store deploy --platform armhf figlet

# Find the URLs for the function
faas-cli store inspect figlet

# Create some ASCII

echo "faasd" | faas-cli invoke figlet
</code></pre>
<p>Try a function that can generate an <code>identicon</code> like you may have seen for default avatar logos on GitHub.com</p>
<pre><code>faas-cli store deploy --platform armhf identicon

echo $USER | faas-cli invoke identicon &gt; avatar.png
</code></pre>
<p>Here's an example of the avatar for the user <code>pi</code>:</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.alexellis.io/content/images/2020/01/avatar.png" alt="avatar"></p>
<h3 id="runanasyncfunction">Run an async function</h3>
<p>You can also run your functions in the background or asynchronously.</p>
<p>Create a webhook receiver using a public service such as:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://requestbin.com/">https://requestbin.com/</a></li>
<li><a href="https://postb.in/">https://postb.in/</a></li>
</ul>
<pre><code>faas-cli store deploy --platform armhf nodeinfo

curl -d "verbose" \
  http://127.0.0.1:8080/async-function/nodeinfo \
  --header "X-Callback-Url: https://postb.in/1578562711776-8760500776115"
</code></pre>
<p>You'll be able to refresh your webhook receiver and see the value.</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.alexellis.io/content/images/2020/01/Screenshot-2020-01-09-at-09.41.11.png" alt="Screenshot-2020-01-09-at-09.41.11"></p>
<h3 id="buildanewcontainerimage">Build a new container image</h3>
<p>You'll need a second Raspberry Pi for this step since we do not have <code>docker</code> installed on the device.</p>
<p>There are a couple of workarounds if you don't have a second device: use buildkit per as my post <a href="https://blog.alexellis.io/building-containers-without-docker/">Building containers without Docker</a>. Or build on your PC using <a href="https://github.com/alexellis/multiarch-templates">one of my multi-arch templates</a>.</p>
<p>You can also use one of my prebuilt functions such as <a href="https://github.com/alexellis/2020/">ascii-2020</a>, but you should only run the <code>faas-cli deploy</code> step.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Log into the Raspberry Pi with <code>ssh</code> and install the <code>faas-cli</code> and <code>docker</code>.</p>
<pre><code>curl -sLfS https://cli.openfaas.com | sudo sh
</code></pre>
<pre><code>curl -sLfS https://get.docker.com | sudo sh

sudo usermod -aG docker pi
newgrp
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p>Log into the Docker Hub</p>
<pre><code>docker login
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p>Create a Golang function</p>
<pre><code>export DOCKER_HUB_NAME="alexellis2"

faas-cli template store pull golang-middleware

faas-cli new --lang golang-middleware \
  hello-world \
  --prefix $DOCKER_HUB_NAME
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p>Now build and push the image</p>
<pre><code>faas-cli push -f hello-world.yml
faas-cli deploy -f hello-world.yml
</code></pre>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="deployyournewcontainer">Deploy your new container</h3>

              News information is important for many different use cases from brand monitoring to trend discovery to financial news monitoring. Many companies rely on news monitoring to find new opportunities in the markets, including new clients.

            <p>
              For the most basic use cases <a href="https://news.google.com/">Google News</a> or <a href="https://www.google.com/alerts">Google Alerts</a> may be enough, but both of these services have many limitations that prevent them from being used on a bigger scale.
            </p>
            <p>
              Unfortunately Google News does not provide a convenient way to retrieve a big amount of relevant data, as it poses a strict limit on the number of articles that could be retrieved per query. Yet another concern is rate limiting restrictions. Google News is primarily focused on human users, not robots, therefore you risk getting your ip banned when trying to make a large amount of queries programmatically.
            </p>
            <p>
              The search interface is also far from perfect, as it does not allow building complex queries, in contrast to
              <a href="https://www.elastic.co/what-is/elasticsearch">modern full-text search storage solutions</a>, which provide a wide variety of operators for building search queries of almost any complexity.

              Our News API collects news articles in <span>real-time</span> from thousands of newspapers, media outlets, news aggregators and other websites, and then presents them in a convenient

            <p>
              Let’s go over the main features and make a side-by-side comparison with Google News.
            </p>

            <ul>
              <li>

                <!-- Text -->
                <h3>
                  Maximum number of articles returned per query.
                </h3>

                <ul>
                  <li>
                    Google News has a max limit of <span>100</span> articles per query without any possibility to retrieve more. This may be a big limitation if the search keyword is very popular and may contain thousands or even tens of thousands of relevant articles.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    In contrast, Datanews News API provides access to <span>all of the relevant articles whenever they were published</span>. The API uses
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pagination">pagination</a> for efficient transfer of a large amount of articles through the network.
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </li>

              <li>

                <!-- Text -->
                <h3>
                  Available news article metadata.
                </h3>

                <ul>
                  <li>
                    Google News provides a limited amount of metadata about each particular article. It usually includes the publication date, description field, title and the original article link.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Datanews API returns more additional information about each article, which is directly extracted from webpage: original article link, title, description, publication date, domain of the publication, url of the image on the article page, <span>list of authors</span>, language, country, <span>snippet of the content</span>.
                  </li>
                </ul>

                <p>Above information is much more useful for use cases such as data collection or public relations. Analyzing authors of the articles on the large scale allows PR firms to work more efficiently, as they will have more context about authors and journalists.</p>
              </li>
              <li>

                <ul>
                  <li>
                    Google News has many <a href="https://github.com/DatanewsOrg/google-news-js">unofficial implementations of client libraries</a> for accessing it’s content. Although, none of them really goes past limitations mentioned above.</li>
                  <li>
                    As for the <a href="https://datanews.io/">Datanews</a>, we have developed special client libraries for several main programming languages to make it super simple to integrate News API into your solution. You can start using and testing the API in just several lines of code. See

              Choosing between <a href="https://news.google.com/">Google News</a> and other News API is really about your use case. If you need something simple just for personal use, then going with Google News or Google Alerts will make perfect sense.
            </p>
            <p>
              Otherwise, if you plan to build some software system with bigger scale, then going with an existing news API provider like <a href="https://datanews.io/">Datanews</a> will make more sense. It will provide you with a reliable and complete news monitoring solution that is ready to be integrated into your product.

	    	    				    		      	    	<p>When it comes to structuring CSS, there is no shortage of different naming conventions, methodologies, and architectures. Be it <a href="http://getbem.com/">BEM</a>, <a href="https://github.com/stubbornella/oocss/wiki">OOCSS</a>, <a href="http://smacss.com/">SMACSS</a>, <a href="https://www.creativebloq.com/web-design/manage-large-css-projects-itcss-101517528">ITCSS</a>, or <a href="https://piccalil.li/cube-css/">CUBE CSS</a> – over the last years, many different approaches to managing modular CSS have emerged. Some are offering strategies on how to split CSS into smaller, more manageable pieces, while others focus more on naming conventions for classes. Sometimes, it can be hard to grasp where the differences or advantages of certain methodologies lie, yet in the end, they all aim at the same: Providing structure and consistency, also known as “avoiding a mess”, when you are working in a team or with your present and future self.</p>

<p>No wonder there isn’t a new project where I don’t start to think about the structure of my CSS a bit and, over time, the way I organize and write CSS has changed a lot. The biggest change came when we all started to write CSS for components. But also preprocessors like Sass have clearly left their mark.</p>

<p>In this post, I will share my current take on CSS structure. It does not religiously follow any particular methodology, although people familiar with <a href="https://www.creativebloq.com/web-design/manage-large-css-projects-itcss-101517528">Harry Roberts’ ITCSS</a> (“Inverted Triangle CSS”) will definitely recognize parts of his methodology. If you haven’t yet looked at ITCSS, I highly recommend it. What I like most, is the pragmatic, real-life approach and the principle of structuring your CSS in a way that gets ever more specific and explicit the farther down you go in the structure. This allows you to focus on the high-level styles first and makes it easier to deal with the cascade, inheritance, and selector specificity while keeping the number of classes – and the specificity! – as low as possible. There are, however, a few differences, and this is also what I’d suggest to anyone setting up their own structure: Take any methodology with a grain of salt and freely adjust it to your needs and the way you work.</p>

<h2>The Folder Structure</h2>

<p>This is how my folder structure currently looks like:</p>

														
	    	    							    	<pre><code>
/scss/
├── 1-settings
├── 2-design-tokens
├── 3-tools
├── 4-generic
├── 5-elements
├── 6-skeleton
├── 7-components
├── 8-utilities
├── _shame.scss
└── main.scss
</code>
</pre>
											
	    	    				    		      	    	<p>Let’s break it down a bit.</p>

<h3>Settings</h3>

<p>The first folder, <code>1-settings</code>, is for all general project settings, so for the most basic high-level configuration. This might be a collection of global variables – either as Sass variables or custom properties.</p>

														
	    	    							    	<pre><code>
├── 1-settings
│&nbsp;&nbsp; └── _global.scss
</code>
</pre>
											
	    	    				    		      	    	<h3>Design Tokens</h3>

<p>The second folder is for all styles regarding the visual vocabulary of the site. At this level, we are still not generating any CSS output. It is where we define variables for the typography, colors, spacing, media-queries, or any other attributes which you will use throughout the design. For these visual design attributes, the term <em>design tokens</em> has taken hold. Those design tokens could even be coming from your design system as a single source of truth.</p>

														
	    	    							    	<pre><code>
├── 2-design-tokens
│&nbsp;&nbsp; ├── _colors.scss
│&nbsp;&nbsp; ├── _fonts.scss
│&nbsp;&nbsp; ├── _media-queries.scss
│&nbsp;&nbsp; ├── _spacing.scss
│&nbsp;&nbsp; └── _typography.scss
</code>
</pre>
											
	    	    				    		      	    	<h3>Tools</h3>

<p>The tools folder is where your global Sass mixins and functions live. Maybe you want to manipulate colors with blend modes or set the aspect ratio for a video container? Or clear your float, for example. I am not a heavy user of mixins myself, but I know many people who love them, so this is where to put them.</p>

														
	    	    							    	<pre><code>
├── 3-tools
│&nbsp;&nbsp; ├── _aspect-ratio.scss
│&nbsp;&nbsp; ├── _blend-modes.scss
│&nbsp;&nbsp; ├── _center.scss
│   ├── _clearfix.scss
│&nbsp;&nbsp; └── _gradients.scss
</code>
</pre>
											
	    	    				    		      	    	<h3>Generic</h3>

<p>Just like in ITCSS, the generic folder is the first one that actually produces CSS. It contains global box-sizing rules, CSS resets, or print styles – anything that should be set right at the beginning of your CSS but isn’t yet project-specific.</p>

														
	    	    							    	<pre><code>
├── 4-generic
│&nbsp;&nbsp; ├── _box-sizing.scss
│&nbsp;&nbsp; ├── _font-face.scss
│&nbsp;&nbsp; ├── _normalize.scss
│&nbsp;&nbsp; └── _print.scss
</code>
</pre>
											
	    	    				    		      	    	<h3>Elements</h3>

<p>Now that the most basic things are set up, we can start to style the building blocks of our front-end: Raw HTML Elements. Mostly without classes, we are now redefining the basic browser styles of headlines, buttons, links, lists, etc. and can make sure that all components in our design are using the same consistent base.</p>

														
	    	    							    	<pre><code>
├── 5-elements
│&nbsp;&nbsp; ├── _forms.scss
│&nbsp;&nbsp; ├── _headings.scss
│&nbsp;&nbsp; ├── _images.scss
│&nbsp;&nbsp; ├── _links.scss
│&nbsp;&nbsp; └── _lists.scss
│&nbsp;&nbsp; ├── ...
</code>
</pre>
											
	    	    				    		      	    	<h3>Skeleton</h3>

<p>Any modern web project that is built with components also comes with the need for a higher-level structure in which all the components can live: Wrappers, containers, grids, and all kinds of reusable objects that provide layout patterns. This is the skeleton of your site.</p>

														
	    	    							    	<pre><code>
├── 6-skeleton
│&nbsp;&nbsp; ├── _grid.scss
│&nbsp;&nbsp; ├── _layouts.scss
│&nbsp;&nbsp; └── _objects.scss
</code>
</pre>
											
	    	    				    		      	    	<h3>Components</h3>

<p>The beating heart of the project. This is where we design the components of the UI. In a few recent projects, I sometimes distinguished between larger modules and smaller components, but you can also nest components into each other and do without the additional distinction. Use prefixes, if you like, and also <a href="https://css-tricks.com/bem-101/">a naming convention like BEM</a> can make a lot of sense. I have recently settled on a BEM-like but more simplified naming convention: Just use the simplest but most descriptive class name possible and separate elements within other elements with a simple dash, like <code>.card</code> and <code>.card-content</code>. Sometimes – for example, when I work with <a href="https://fractal.build/">Fractal</a> – the CSS for individual components might also live in another folder, together with the HTML and JavaScript code. In this case, the components folder might be empty, or contain references via <code>@import</code>.</p>

														
	    	    							    	<pre><code>
├── 7-components
│&nbsp;&nbsp; ├── _accordion.scss
│&nbsp;&nbsp; ├── _card.scss
│&nbsp;&nbsp; ├── _hero.scss
│&nbsp;&nbsp; ├── _pan-galactic-gargle-blaster.scss
│&nbsp;&nbsp; └── ...
</code>
</pre>
											
	    	    				    		      	    	<h3>Utilities</h3>

<p>Another folder? Yes, but this is definitely the last one. The utilities folder contains utility and helper classes and, most importantly, states and modifiers like <code>.is-active</code> or <code>.visually-hidden</code>. Those styles override the styles in the previous layers and are often set via JavaScript. I really like <a href="https://piccalil.li/cube-css/exception/">the suggestion by Andy Bell in his CUBE CSS methodology</a> to use data-attributes to change the state of components, which is also useful in terms of the higher specificity.</p>

														
	    	    							    	<pre><code>
├── 8-utilities
│&nbsp;&nbsp; ├── _modifiers.scss
│&nbsp;&nbsp; └── _states.scss
</code>
</pre>
											
	    	    				    		      	    	<h3>_shame.scss</h3>

<p>This file, which is <a href="https://csswizardry.com/2013/04/shame-css/">another idea by Harry Roberts</a>, is a place for all the shameful CSS solutions like quick fixes and hacky things that might solve a problem for the time being but should be solved properly later. Make sure to document all those nasty hacks with comments, though: Why did you solve it this way? Do you already have an idea on how to solve it better? What is needed to solve it? And so on…</p>

<h3>Putting it all together</h3>

<p>Finally, the <code>main.scss</code> file is where all the individual files are combined. I prefer to explicitly import each file in a new line instead of importing whole folders because I have more control over the source order. But this is only my personal preference, of course.</p>

														
	    	    							    	<pre><code>
@charset "UTF-8";

// 1. Settings
@import 
	"1-settings/global";
  
// 2. Design Tokens
@import
  "2-design-tokens/colors",
  "2-design-tokens/fonts",
  "2-design-tokens/media-queries",
  "2-design-tokens/spacing",
  "2-design-tokens/typography";
...
</code>
</pre>
											
	    	    				    		      	    	<p>And that’s it. A structure like this has served me well in recent projects because it keeps everything tidy. The resulting CSS is also much cleaner and it is easier to find the right piece of code when you have to make changes or do bugfixes.</p>

<p>I asked on Twitter the other day which CSS methodology you all prefer and the results were, as was to be expected, mixed:</p>

														
	    	    							    	<blockquote data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Web developers and designers of the interwebs! What is your favorite…</p><p>✨CSS methodology✨?</p><p>—and why?</p></div>— Matthias Ott (@m_ott) <a href="https://twitter.com/m_ott/status/1292946698717757444?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 10, 2020</a></blockquote>  
											
	    	    				    		      	    	<p>People all like to use their own flavor of CSS, which is great.  If you use a methodology or folder structure that you would like to share, write a post about it and I’ll happily link to it here. It would be interesting to see how you structure your CSS.</p>

<p>For future reference, here’s the whole folder structure again:</p>

				<p>Has it ever happened to you that your hosting crashed, and your website was down for hours without you even noticing? Never again!</p>
<p>Monitoria si an active monitoring service you can use to monitor your website or basically any HTTP(S) endpoint. It will periodically send requests to the selected URL, and when it starts receiving errors, it will send you a notification.</p>
<p>This way, you will be notified immediately when your website is down.</p>
<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>When you create a monitor, it will be sending a monitoring request every 5 minutes. After three consecutive failures, the monitor will send a notification to your email address.</p>
<p>Besides the notification functionality, you can find a lot of useful information on the monitor overview page. Most importantly:</p>
<ul>
<li>Monitoring statistics</li>
<li>Timeline of monitoring requests and events</li>
<li>Information why monitoring request failed</li>
</ul>
<p>Check out the screenshot below showing the monitor overview and describing the monitoring timeline.</p>
<div>
    
    <p><img src="https://cdn.monitoria.ca/img/Screenshot13a.png" alt="Monitor overview screenshot">        
    </p>
</div>
<h2 id="future">Future</h2>
<p>Even that we just started, there is already plenty of features we plan to implement in the future. Before the end of this year, we will be releasing:</p>
<ul>
<li>Much faster notifications with 1-minute monitors</li>
<li>More notification options (multiple email addresses, SMS, etc.)</li>
<li>Advanced configuration options for monitors (configurable monitoring request and success checks, variable alarming and recovery intervals, etc.)</li>
</ul>
<p>Anyway, these are exciting times, and I’m looking forward to continue working on this project.</p>
<p>If you have any questions, suggestions, or just want to say hi, then send me an email at <a href="mailto:robert@monitoria.ca">robert@monitoria.ca</a>. I will be happy to hear from you.</p>

They offered me a cheap dead 42-inchPhilips 42PFL7962 TV set with the diagnosis “after a thunderstorm the mine-board burned down”. An autopsy revealed that the mine in it is not at all. Without thinking twice, I decided to put in it a universal mine-card with a DVB-T2 tuner, since the original part cannot compete either in price or in functionality. During installation, there were some difficulties associated with the power supply of the TV and its large diagonal, which I will try to describe in the review. <br><span id="more-1384"></span><br>
This board is perhaps the most popular of allbecause it accepts digital TV DVB-T2, and at the same time is quite cheap. Prices for a scaler without a number start at 700 rubles and, given that analog TV in Russia will soon completely disappear, it makes sense to order them only if used as a monitor. Scaler arrived very quickly, was ordered on October 10 and already on October 22 I took the package.<br>
<img src="http://redlightgreen.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/1/image-15265.png"><br>
The carton contains: a board, a remote control, a silicone case for it, an IR receiver and a small piece of wire with a connector for connecting it to the board, as well as instructions on A4 paper.<br>
<img src="http://redlightgreen.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/1/image-15268.jpg"><br>
<img src="http://redlightgreen.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/1/image-15271.jpg"><br>
The board is very compact, dimensions 180 * 40 mm. <br>
<img src="http://redlightgreen.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/1/image-15275.jpg"><br>
Additional Information<br>
</p><p>

Practically all connectors are located on the long side of the board: input for external power supply 12V, USB connector, HDMI input, VGA input, AV input, PC-Audio input, antenna input and headphone output.<br>

On the side there is a component input.<br>
<img src="http://redlightgreen.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/1/image-15288.jpg"><br>
On the back of the board is a sticker with information about the board.<br>

Preparing the lane for work<br>
One of the known problems of this board is strongCPU heat. Even before the first power up, it was decided to replace the “radiator”, glued to the process, with a more massive one. The small aluminum diffuser broke away from the processor almost effortlessly. Marking of the processor MSD3663LUA-Z1.<br>
<img src="http://redlightgreen.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/1/image-15362.jpg"><br>
Additional Information</p><p>

Wiring LVDS cable<br>
The PHILIPS 42PFL7962D TV uses the T420HW01 V.2 panel, the resolution is 1920 * 1080, 16.7 million colors, the supply voltage is 12V, the current consumption is 1A. Pinout and other technical data are in <a target="_blank" href="http://go.redlightgreen.org/redirect/cpa/o/pn2mxkz8nz4v07lyadx410a613pugos2?to=http%3A%2F%2Farchive.espec.ws%2Fsection1063%2Ffile29799.html&amp;key=ms&amp;s=msab.62ad69c">datasheet</a> on her.<br>
This is how the plug in the T-Con of the matrix looks like:<br>
<img src="http://redlightgreen.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/1/image-15370.jpg"><br>
We paint the pinout of the matrix, the universal lane and correlate:<br>
<img src="http://redlightgreen.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/1/image-15372.jpg"><br>
It is seen that the signal pairs of wires are made in the same color, which facilitates their search. Negative signal wires with a black stripe along. Find each pair and mark it. <br>
<img src="http://redlightgreen.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/1/image-15373.jpg"><br>
We also mark the power supply and "earth" wiring. Then we connect them with the corresponding pins on the connector. I regretted that I did not order the LVDS cable together with the card, since the TV cable has a different plug for connecting to the lane. I had to solder directly to the pins on the back of the board.<br>
<img src="http://redlightgreen.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/1/image-15375.jpg"><br>
<img src="http://redlightgreen.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/1/image-15377.jpg"><br>
In principle, the mine is ready for a performance check (it and the TV matrix). Install the matrix power supply jumper to 12V.<br>
<img src="http://redlightgreen.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/1/image-15379.jpg"><br>
We power the backlight separately from the native unitTV power, and lanes - from another small power supply unit, issuing 12 V. We connect the buttons and the IR receiver (left from another universal lane) and everything is ready.<br>
<img src="http://redlightgreen.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/1/image-15381.jpg"><br>
But before turning on our constructor, it is necessary to flash the board for the resolution of the matrix we need.<br>
Firmware</p><p>

Now that we have verified that the board is working, we need to bring the design to mind. <br>
About power supply<br>
The TV uses a power supply <a target="_blank" href="http://go.redlightgreen.org/redirect/cpa/o/pn2mxkz8nz4v07lyadx410a613pugos2?to=http%3A%2F%2Ftel-spb.ru%2Ffiles%2Fphilips_plcd300p3.rar&amp;key=ms&amp;s=msab.3703560">PLCD300P3</a> 170 W. It provides 3 supply voltages: 5.2V, 12V and 24V. And then I ran into some of the nuances. One of them is that when turned on, the power supply unit produces only one voltage of 5.2V. A 12 and 24 volts appear when the light signal turns on the BLON illumination from the lane. And, as you know, the mine is powered by 12V. It turns out that we can not power the universal board from this power supply?<br>
In fact, the universal mine can eatfrom 5 volts. 12 V is only used when a 12-volt matrix is ​​connected to it. Next are stabilizers 5V, 3.3V and 1.8V, which feeds the processor board. So, the lane can be powered from 5V in case the matrix supply voltage is 5 or 3.3 V. Here, only the lane does not have a connector for connecting to 5 Volt directly. It is necessary to solder the supply wiring to the electrolytic capacitor, which stands after the 5V - stabilizer (on this board it is ECW53).<br>
<img src="http://redlightgreen.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/1/image-15389.jpg"><br>
<img src="http://redlightgreen.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/1/image-15391.jpg"><br>
We are convinced of the performance of this design (the blue LED is on, responds to the commands of the console).<br>
<img src="http://redlightgreen.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/1/image-15394.jpg"><br>
However, now it is not possible to power the 12-voltlane matrix. Therefore, we connect the matrix to the output 12V of the power supply. After all, as you know, these same 12V will appear only after the activation signal from the mine. This is just what you need.<br>
We unsolder the power supply wires from the lane (connect to pin 1 and 2) and solder to the connector of the power supply.<br>
<img src="http://redlightgreen.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/1/image-15395.jpg"><br>
This matrix power supply has anotheradvantage. As indicated above, the current flowing through the matrix is ​​about 1A. Which is too much for a tiny SMD transistor on the lane that opens up power to it. He withstood the first few inclusions, but who knows how much is enough for him. (I read about this issue somewhere on the forums, as an option - to replace the transistor on the universal lane with a more powerful one). <br>
The overall power scheme of the TV looks like this:<br>
<img src="http://redlightgreen.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/1/image-15397.png"><br>
Voltage 5V is constantly supplied to the main-board,when switched on, the BLON + 5V signal comes from the duty mode from the lane to the power supply unit, which opens the + 12V supply to the matrix and + 24V to the backlight. And here there was another snag.<br>
The fact is that the power supply has an on signalSTBY is inverse, that is, the power of the backlight and the matrix appears after the pin of STBY closes to ground. Here is the section of the power supply circuit that is responsible for this signal.<br>
<img src="http://redlightgreen.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/1/image-15399.png"><br>
When a low level signal is applied to the STBY pin(when it is shorted to ground), the T101 transistor opens, power is supplied to the LED of the optocoupler U101, which starts the PWMs that form 12 and 24 V. If you send + 5V from the lane to STBY, nothing will happen, the transistor will not open. So, it is necessary to modify the circuit so that the LED of the optocoupler lights up when a high level signal is applied from the lane. To do this, I added another key on the npn transistor, and the scheme began to look like this:<br>
<img src="http://redlightgreen.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/1/image-15401.png"><br>
The key connects to the gap between pin 2optocouplers and ground. In this case, the base of the transistor U101 closes to ground. Thus, T101 is constantly open, and KT503 opens when a high level signal (+ 5V) is applied to its base, lighting the LED of the optocoupler. You can use any npn transistor, and calculate the divider so that the voltage between the base and the emitter is at least 2 times lower than the limit on the datasheet. With two identical resistors, it turns out to be +2.5 V. The key is assembled on a small board and glued to hot-melt adhesive on the power supply.<br>
<img src="http://redlightgreen.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/1/image-15402.jpg"><br>
Now, you can put everything together in a package.tv set The power supply unit has risen to a regular place. For the universal lane I marked out holes on the metal substrate on which the old mine-board was located, and secured the stands.<br>
<img src="http://redlightgreen.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/1/image-15405.jpg"><br>
<img src="http://redlightgreen.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/1/image-15407.jpg"><br>
A board with an IR receiver and a LED from anotherI fixed the TV on a hot-melt glue, the distances between the windows for them coincided, and there were too many active elements on the motherboard, and I didn’t want to mess around with the wiring. The buttons are left native, but since they are paralleled, all 6 buttons are connected to pin 6, that is, you can turn on or off any of these 6 buttons in standby mode. <br>
<img src="http://redlightgreen.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/1/image-15410.jpg"><br>
View of the TV assembly without the back cover:<br>
<img src="http://redlightgreen.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/1/image-15413.jpg"><br>
On the back cover did not make any cuts, onlyremoved the metal casing covering the lane from the side of the connectors and from above, to access the side AV connectors. The board turned out to be slightly recessed inside the case, all because of the short LVDS cable, but this does not interfere with access to the inputs.<br>
<img src="http://redlightgreen.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/1/image-15415.jpg"><br>

<img src="http://redlightgreen.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/1/image-15418.jpg"><br>
We turn on, and first of all we turn on autotune of channels. You can configure analog and digital TV separately, and select the desired region.<br>
<img src="http://redlightgreen.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/1/image-15421.jpg"><br>
Autotune goes for a long time, about 10 minutes. A dozen kilometers from the TV tower to the active antenna were found all the analog and digital channels that are available. <br>
<img src="http://redlightgreen.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/1/image-15422.jpg"><br>
The quality of digital images, of course, does not compare with the analog, although all digital channels broadcast in 576r.<br>
<img src="http://redlightgreen.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/1/image-15424.jpg"><br>
<img src="http://redlightgreen.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/1/image-15426.jpg"><br>
Digital channels are switched with a pause per second, below for a few seconds information about the channel, the name of the program, date, time and everything else is displayed.<br>

<p>Using less information to make better decisions.</p>


<p>In many large-scale web services, multiple layers of stateless and stateful services are seperated by load balancers. Load balancing can be done with dedicated hardware, with dedicated software load balancers, using DNS trickery or through a load-balancing mechanism in the client. In large systems, the resources and constraints at each layer can vary widely. Some layers are stateless, and easily scale horizontally to many machines. Other layers may be more constrained, either due to the need to access state or contention for some other shared resource.</p>

<p>Centralized load balancing solutions can distribute load over a fleet of machines very well. They track the amount of load they are sending to each machine (usually based on a simple measurement like connection count). Because they are centralized, load balancers typically don't need to worry about load sent from other sources. They have complete control over the distribution of load.</p>

<p>Despite this advantage, dediced load balancers are often undesirable. They add cost, latency, complexity, and may introduce a single point of failure. Handing the task of load balancing to each upstream client is also possible, but introduces the challenge of fairly balancing the load from multiple places. In large systems with large numbers of clients and fairly homogeneous calls, a purely random system like DNS round robin can work very well. In smaller systems, systems where each downstream service can only handle a small number or concurrent requests, and systems where requests are heterogeneous it's often desirable to load balance better than random.</p>

<p>Perfect distributed load balancing could be done, at least in the happy case, by distributing information about system load across all the clients. The overhead of constantly sharing the exact load information between different sources can be high, so it's tempting to have each source work off a cached copy. This data can periodically be refreshed from downstream, or from other clients.</p>

<p>It turns out that's not a great idea.</p>

<p>In <a href="http://www.eecs.harvard.edu/~michaelm/postscripts/handbook2001.pdf">The Power of Two Random Choices: A Survey of Techniques and Results</a>, Mitzenmacher et. al. survey some research very relevant to this problem. The entire survey is good reading, but one of the most interesting results is about the effects of delayed data (like the cached load results mentioned above) on load balancing. The results are fairly logical in retrospect, but probably don't match most engineers' first expectations.</p>

<p>Using stale data for load balancing leads to a herd behavior, where requests will herd toward a previously quiet host for much longer than it takes to make that host very busy indeed. The next refresh of the cached load data will put the server high up the load list, and it will become quiet again. Then busy again as the next herd sees that it's quiet. Busy. Quiet. Busy. Quiet. And so on.</p>

<p>One possible solution would be to give up on load balancing entirely, and just pick a host at random. Depending on the load factor, that can be a good approach. With many typical loads, though, picking a random host degrades latency and reduces throughput by wasting resources on servers which end up unlucky and quiet.</p>

<p>The approach taken by the studies surveyed by Mitzenmacher is to try two hosts, and pick the one with the least load. This can be done directly (by querying the hosts) but also works surprisingly well on cached load data.</p>

<p>To illustrate how well this works, I ran a simulation of a very simplistic system. Every second one request arrives at a system with 10 servers. Every 8 seconds the oldest request (if any) is removed from the queue on the servers. Load balancing is done with a cached copy of the server queue lengths, updated every N seconds. I considered four approaches: chose a random server, chose the best server, best of two random choices and best of three random choices.</p>

<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/mbrooker-blog-images/mbrooker_best_of_two_result.png" alt=""></p>

<p>As you can expect, the <em>pick the best</em> approach worked best when perfect undelayed information was available. In the same case, the random pick approach worked poorly, leading to the worst queue times of any of the approaches. As the age of the data increases, the <em>pick the best</em> approach becomes worse and worse because of herding and soon overtakes the random approach as the worst one.</p>

<p><em>Best of 3</em> starts in second place, and puts in a good performance. It gains first place, only to cede it to <em>best of 2</em> as the delay increases. Clearly, the behavior for <em>best of k</em> will approach the behavior of <em>best</em> as k approaches the number of servers. <em>Best of 2</em> remains the strong leader all the way to the end of this simulation. Given these parameters it would start losing to the random approach around a refresh interval of 70. It is the clear leader for intervals over the range from 10 to 70, which is an impressive performance for such a simple approach.</p>

<p><em>Best of 2</em> is good because it combines the best of both worlds: it uses real information about load to pick a host (unlike random), but rejects herd behavior much more strongly than the other two approaches.</p>

<p>Take a look at <a href="http://www.eecs.harvard.edu/~michaelm/postscripts/handbook2001.pdf">The Power of Two Random Choices</a> for a much stronger mathematical argument, and some more surprising places this algorithm works really well.</p>

        <section>
            <p><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/wedding-website/image/upload/c_scale,w_2400/v1597095361/krzysztof-grech-6orUY98fw9s-unsplash_r6wjnf.jpg"></p>



<p>I’ve struggled to find references to this online, but heard the name used multiple times this year when describing the approach outlined here.</p>

<p>The general idea of an “Islands” architecture is deceptively simple: render HTML pages on the server, and inject placeholders or slots around highly dynamic regions. These placeholders/slots contain the server-rendered HTML output from their corresponding widget. They denote regions that can then be "hydrated" on the client into small self-contained widgets, reusing their server-rendered initial HTML.</p>

<p>You can think of this like a static HTML document that contains multiple separate embedded applications:</p>

<p>  
<img width="600" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/wedding-website/image/upload/v1596766231/islands-architecture-1.png">  
</p>

<p>This may seem similar to "micro-frontends" at first glance. Both approaches share the idea of breaking applications up into independent units, however "micro-frontends" do not typically imply that composition of those units is achieved using HTML.</p>

<p>A closer analog to the "islands" approach would be progressive enhancement, to which we're essentially adding SSR hydration and a consistent metaphor for adding interactivity to a region of the page. In traditional progressive enhancement, we might have a <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> that looks for an image carousel in the page and instantiates a jQuery plugin on it. Instead, that image carousel would be rendered on the server and a dedicated <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> emitted for it that loads the image carousel implementation and in-place upgrades it to be interactive.</p>

<h3 id="whydoesthismatter">Why does this matter?</h3>

<p>As it turns out, there are a number of benefits to the group of approaches described here when compared to typical Single Page Application architectures.</p>

<h5 id="progressivehydrationforfree">"Progressive Hydration" for free</h5>

<p>I’ve touted the performance benefits of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-A2VfuUROg">Progressive Hydration</a> techniques for frameworks like React, Angular, Preact and Vue. With these architectures, individual widgets on a page are loaded and initialized over time. This can be done using a simple scheduling approach via requestIdleCallback, or can take additional factors into account like viewport visibility, interaction likelihood, product value, etc.</p>

<p>Similar to Progressive Hydration, rendering pages using an islands architecture results in the heavier dynamic portions of the page being initialized not just progressively, but <em>separately</em>. This means individual regions of the page become interactive without anything else on the page needing to be loaded first.</p>

<p>Unlike Progressive Hydration, the approaches that fall out of building around an islands architecture do not require top-down rendering. This is a distinct advantage, since there are no outer “root” components that must be initialized before their descendants. Each part of the page is an isolated unit, and a performance issue in one unit doesn't affect the others.</p>

<h5 id="seoanduxarentatradeoff">SEO and UX aren’t a tradeoff</h5>

<p>The status quo for SSR as used by Single Page Applications is that it’s often cited as a necessity for SEO reasons. However, SSR can actually have a net <em>negative</em> impact on User Experience - visitors are left waiting for the actual functionality of a page to arrive while staring at a frustratingly fake version of that page.</p>

<p>Many applications also suffer from silent SSR performance pitfalls without realizing it. In virtual DOM libraries, it's easy (and common) to accidentally construct a situation where first render destroys the server-rendered HTML DOM, only to recreate it again from scratch (often synchronously). This is the result of some common misconceptions, which may stem from documentation giving an idealized view of hydration while passing over tricky caveats and footguns.</p>

<p>Even in cases where SSR hydration is functioning as designed, the status quo leaves a lot to be desired. The amount of JavaScript work being performed during page load is still many orders of magnitude more than what might be considered "efficient".</p>

</figure>

<p>In an "islands" model, server rendering is not a bolt-on optimization aimed at improving SEO or UX. Instead, it is a fundamental part of how pages are delivered to the browser. The HTML returned in response to navigation contains a meaningful and immediately renderable representation of the content the user requested.</p>

<p>Sections of that HTML may be missing their client-side interactivity, but the document should at least contain the most essential content. For example: a news page’s HTML would contain the article body, and a product page would contain that product’s description.</p>

<p>All of the other content is secondary to this information, and its inclusion in the HTML becomes a product decision. How vital is this bit of information to a user visiting the page? How important is that widget to the business model? A "buy now" button that directly relates to revenue should be easily prioritized over a site feedback survey button that relates to information gathering.</p>

<h5 id="betterforaccessibilityanddiscoverability">Better for accessibility and discoverability</h5>

<p>A website that uses standard HTML links for navigation is easier for assistive technologies and web crawlers to use. This is true regardless of whether links or forms are intercepted by JavaScript and rerouted to client-side logic, because the underlying assumptions remain true: clicking a link navigates to the given page.</p>

<p>Anecdotally, think of the number of times you’ve been sent a “link” to what the sender assumed was the page they were viewing, only to realize the link contained none of the necessary information:</p>

<p>  
<img width="350" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/wedding-website/image/upload/v1596766231/islands-architecture-3.png">  
</p>

<p>Building page-based applications doesn't completely prevent these types of strange experiences, it only makes the decision to do so more direct. It makes the default outcome the accessible one.</p>

<hr>

<p>When it comes down to it, shipping an architecture that requires less code to do something is the type of long-term benefit your future self (or coworkers) will thank you for. It's possible — likely, even — that adopting a model like this requires more up-front design thinking. There are far few batteries-included options available for decomposing apps into independently deliverable widgets. Who knows, maybe we can fix that.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
       <p>In response to <a href="https://applieddivinitystudies.com/2020/09/05/rationality-winning/">Where are all the Successful Rationalists</a>, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/MTqWL53brYhnGiAJN/link-where-are-all-the-successful-rationalists">Robert Wiblin writes</a>:<br><em>The EA community seems to have a lot of very successful people by normal social standards, pursuing earning to give, research, politics and more… Typically they aren’t yet at the top of their fields but that’s unsurprising as most are 25-35.</em></p>
<p>He’s basically right. On the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://slatestarcodex.com/2019/01/13/ssc-survey-results-2019/">SSC 2019 survey</a>, the median reader was 30. [1]</p>
<p>So Wiblin’s right, but his comment begs a much more important question: <strong>why do rationalists think being young is incompatible with being at the top of your field?</strong></p>
<p>Take for example, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://bioeng.berkeley.edu/faculty/patrick-hsu">Patrick Hsu</a>. He’s 29, an assistant professor at Berkeley, and <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=LhnU_joAAAAJ&amp;hl=en&amp;oi=ao">has his name on several seminal CRISPR papers</a>. He <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://twitter.com/pdhsu/status/1162410158443511808">reads and endorses Alexey Guzey</a> so he’s clearly into weird blogs on the internet. It’s not unreasonable to think that people like this should be part of the rationality community.</p>
<p>Or to take a more visible case, consider all the very young startup founders.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.briantimar.com/notes/founders/">Brian Timar</a> looked at the companies he’s interested in, and found that the average and median age at founding was 30. If you scan <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.ycombinator.com/topcompanies/">YC’s top 100 companies</a>, many of the founders were under 35 when they started:</p>
<p><img src="https://applieddivinitystudies.com/images/age-at-founding.png"></p><p>92% of founders were under 30 when they started their companies, mean and median age were both 26.</p>
<p>But okay, we might not expect to know about founders who are just getting started. You’re not successful until your company actually succeeds. So how old are those same founders now? Still pretty young.</p>
<p><img src="https://applieddivinitystudies.com/images/current-age.png"></p><p>46% are still under 35, and 85% are under 40. Mean is 36, median is 35.</p>
<p>Data for both charts <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1FeDDGo_SWeDMMZlTrJ_P2TifyJoOqAuOD8klBKQpUdA/edit?usp=sharing">here</a>.</p>
<p>Granting Wiblin’s point about youth, I’ll ask again: where are all the successful rationalists?</p>
<hr>
<p>It gets a lot worse when you consider that ideologically, rationalists should be uniquely well positioned to start a company.</p>
<p><strong>Linear Returns from Wealth</strong><br>For a normal person, the expected financial value of a startup may be high, but the expected returns to personal happiness are very low. A billion dollars will probably only make you a little bit happier than million, so it makes sense to be risk averse and keep your day job. <strong>But for a rationalist utilitarian, returns from wealth are perfectly linear! Every dollar you earn is another dollar you can give to prevent Malaria.</strong> So when it comes to earning, rationalists ought to be risk-neutral, and skew more heavily than normal people towards starting companies.</p>
<p><strong>Willingness to be Weird and Lame</strong><br><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://paulgraham.com/early.html">Paul Graham says</a> “One of the biggest things holding people back from doing great work is the fear of making something lame.” Meanwhile, rationalists totally disregard this tendency to spend years working on things no one else cares about. Will MacAskill has been <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MP4WryyGMlE&amp;t=5m10s">speaking for years</a> on the importance of keeping EA weird, but even before that there was a decade of posts about nootropics, longevity and superintelligence, long before it was cool.</p>
<p>Another <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJDlzvqrPLk&amp;t=14m10s">panel</a> from back in 2009: “I think we can fairly say that we’re all, Peter maybe less so, not afraid to being weird”</p>
<p><strong>Low Probability High Return Bets</strong><br>Rationalists are also already into doing things with a tiny probability of huge impact, as described in <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.openphilanthropy.org/blog/hits-based-giving">OpenPhil’s Hits-based Giving</a>. This is the entire justification for caring about this like AI Safety. You multiply out the probabilities, and preventing even a 1-in-a-thousand chance of extinction turns out to be a very effective use of time.</p>
<p><strong>Slant Towards Tech</strong><br>Many rationalists are in the UK, but today the epicenter skews more towards the Bay Area. <a href="https://applieddivinitystudies.com/2020/09/05/rationality-winning/">As I wrote last time</a>, 40% work in software engineering, so they should be relatively well poised to start companies.</p>
<p>So seriously, where are all the successful rationalists?</p>
<hr>
<p>Many qualities are ascribed to startup founders. Visionary, optimist, contrarian, workaholic.</p>
<p>What you don’t hear is founders praised for their intellectual honesty.</p>
<p>That shouldn’t come as a surprise. It’s no secret that you need a kind of unreasonable self-confidence to pitch VCs. Less discussed but analogous is the process of recruiting early employees. It is not very compelling to offer: “Come work for me, if we’re incredibly lucky there’s a miniscule chance you’ll get .1% of a billion dollar company which comes out to $500 thousand after dilution, $250 thousand after tax, over 4 years, minus the strike price.”</p>
<p>Alex Danco asks <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://alexdanco.com/2020/09/17/are-founders-allowed-to-lie/">Are Founders Allowed to Lie</a>. It’s a good piece and you should read it, but the fact that he even has to ask means it’s possible the answer is “yes”, which is just not something any normal industry says about its leaders.</p>
<p>The easiest explanation is that founders really are just consciously manipulative, but I worry we’re underestimating how hard that would be. It takes enormous energy to maintain a lie, and tremendous sociopathy to do so consciously. From what I can tell, a lot of these founders are actually disproportionately philanthropic. I can’t rule out that this is just a PR move or whatever, but this whole idea just feels somewhat extreme and conspiratorial.</p>
<p>So okay, maybe it’s unconscious? Maybe founders are uniquely out of touch with reality and genuinely believe that they’re very likely to beat the overwhelming odds against them?</p>
<p>Again, this doesn’t feel right. Sure, you have to be optimistic, but you can’t be straight up delusional and continue to function at a very high level. Kara Swisher and Elon have a <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.vox.com/2018/11/2/18053424/elon-musk-tesla-spacex-boring-company-self-driving-cars-saudi-twitter-kara-swisher-decode-podcast">great exchange</a> about this, maybe my favorite moment in any interview ever:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>[KS:] What about things that are just critical of you that you don’t like? Do you think you’re particularly sensitive?</strong></p>
<p>[EM:] No. Of course not. Count how many negative articles there are and how many I respond to. One percent, maybe. But the common rebuttal of journalists is, “Oh. My article’s fine. He’s just thin-skinned.” No, your article is false and you don’t want to admit it.</p>
<p><strong>Do you take criticism to heart correctly?</strong></p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p><strong>Give me an example of something if you could.</strong></p>
<p>How do you think rockets get to orbit?</p>
<p><strong>That’s a fair point.</strong></p>
<p>Not easily. Physics is very demanding. If you get it wrong, the rocket will blow up. Cars are very demanding. If you get it wrong, a car won’t work. Truth in engineering and science is extremely important.</p>
<p><strong>Right. And therefore?</strong></p>
<p>I have a strong interest in the truth.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<p>If founders aren’t liars or delusional, what could explain their seemingly irrational optimism?</p>
<p>Rather than general dishonesty, my theory is that founders neglect one kind of reasoning very specifically. The same kind most rationalists are obsessed with: taking the outside view.</p>
<p>I’m using “outside view” as a kind of general term for meta-level thinking, consulting base rates, or using <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://slatestarcodex.com/2013/08/06/on-first-looking-into-chapmans-pop-bayesianism/">bayesian epistemology</a>. Basically, it means not trusting your first-order estimates too much, looking around to see whether or not those estimates are justified, and reasoning “from behind the veil”. As <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://equilibriabook.com/">Inadequate Equilibria</a> describes it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Modest epistemology doesn’t need to reflect a skepticism about causal models as such. It can manifest instead as a wariness about putting weight down on one’s own causal models, as opposed to others’….</p>
<p>If we were fully rational (and fully honest), then we would always eventually reach consensus on questions of fact. To become more rational, then, shouldn’t we set aside our claims to special knowledge or insight and modestly profess that, really, we’re all in the same boat? [2]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here’s a more concrete example: A rationalist has a good startup idea, so they set out to calculate expected value. YC’s acceptance rate is something like 1%, and even within YC companies, only 1% of them will ever be worth $1 billion. So your odds of actually having an exit of that magnitude are 10,000 to 1, and then you’re diluted down to 10% ownership and taxed at around 50%. Of course, there are exits under and above a billion, but back-of-the-napkin, you’re looking at an expected $5,000 for 10+ years of work so grueling that even successful founders describe it as “<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZlHbjxtECg">eating glass and staring at the abyss</a>“. [3]</p>
<p>This is so deeply ingrained in my head as the rational way to think, that it took me a long time to realize that other people just fundamentally don’t approach problems this way. I would venture to guess that the normal train of thought is closer to: “Most startups fail, but that’s because their ideas are bad. Since my idea is very good, I’ll neglect the base rates. I am very special.”</p>
<p>Does that sound mean? It shouldn’t. There’s nothing wrong with thinking that you’re special. It’s not a moral belief, or a claim to entitlement. It’s just the understanding that you are not a median member of the general population, so base rates about “anyone who has ever applied to YC” don’t apply.</p>
<p>The rationalist sees the 1% acceptance rate and gets intimidated. Normal people see that <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.ycombinator.com/faq/#q17">applying to YC</a> <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://blog.ycombinator.com/common-misconceptions-about-applying-to-yc/">explicitly</a> does not require a business plan, incorporation, existing revenue, or an introduction, and understand that any idiot with a couple hours can will out a web form. Accordingly, they totally ignore the base rate.</p>
<p>That’s all the acceptance part of starting a company, but much more important is actually coming up with an idea you believe in. Rationalists tend to accept the Efficient Markets Hypothesis. They look at an industry, think “what are the odds I know more than people who have done this for a decade?” and assume any seeming inefficiencies are just a <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Chesterton%27s_Fence">Chesterton’s Fence</a>.</p>
<p>That’s not what normal people do at all. Normal people look at an industry, they see a gross inefficiency staring at them in the face, and they think “wow, that’s grossly inefficient!”</p>
<p>And then sometimes, they even set out to solve it.</p>
<hr>
<p>[1] If the median rationalist is now 30, and Yudkowsky started writing in 2007, was his audience mostly teenagers?</p>
<p>[2] I’m not exaggerating. In fact, this is a massive oversimplification of the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.getguesstimate.com/models/316">estimates of startup success</a> rationalists actually put together.</p>
<p>[3] To be fair, Yudkowsky is specifically attempting to correct against modest epistemology, concluding with an exhortation to not take the outside view so much and instead “spend most of …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page">

<p>David Crowe<br>Version 3<br>April 24, 2020</p>
<p>
I am a wireless telecom consultant, and have been since 1992. If you want, you can believe that the fact that my income comes from the wireless industry disqualifies me from commenting. Or perhaps, that my expertise is helpful. I have no financial relationship with any company making 5G equipment, although in full disclosure, I was engaged as an expert witness by Huawei around 2011, but that was before much 4G equipment was available, and 5G was still a dream. And an expert witness is ideally not an exponent of the position of a company, and I like to believe I am an ideal expert witness.

</p><h2>5G is Not a Well Defined Concept</h2>
<p>
5G is a set of goals defined by the ITU, not a specific technology. The most obvious goal is that wireless devices should be able to receive data at the fantastic speed of 1Gbps or even higher. This can be achieved by satellites, large towers, or tiny little boxes sitting on the ceiling of an office, or on the wall of a building outside. There are a wide range of frequencies being planned for use although it is true that a lot of 5G systems are planning to use higher frequencies than 4G.

</p><h2>Confusing 5G with GHz and Gbps</h2>
<p>
A lot of critics of 5G seem to be terribly confused by the letter G. Is this the fault of telecom engineers who over-used the letter, or of the critics who couldn’t be bothered to spend an hour researching and writing down the definitions? Let’s straighten that out now:
</p><ul>
<li>The “G” in 5G stands for “Generation”. 1G was analog communications, 2G was early digital with SMS but no data, 3G provided the first data systems, 4G provided a data-only system, with voice treated as just one type of data, and 5G will provide even higher speeds and other advantages.
</li><li>The “G” in GHz stands for one billion (Giga) and references the frequency of the communications. Cellular communications started at 400-900 MHz (Mega = one million) in the 1980s, or just under 1GHz. PCS in the 1990s moved communications up to 2GHz. Some 4G communications are at frequencies as high as 3.5GHz, and 5G is talking about going up to 60GHz. But a lot is still just talk.
</li><li>The “G” in Gbps also stands for one billion, but this is referencing data speed. In the days of modems people talked about kbps (thousands of bits per second). With DSL and ethernet, Mbps (millions of bits per seconds), and now we are in the realm of Gbps (billions of bits per seconds).
</li></ul>

<h2>Explaining What Does Not Need to Be Explained</h2>
<p>
5G in Wuhan is an explanation for a surge of deaths that might be imaginary. I have still seen no evidence that this city of 11 million people actually was experiencing a surge of deaths. First, bring the evidence that there was a dramatic increase, otherwise there is nothing that needs to be explained by 5G or any other theory about the root cause.

</p><h2>Other Explanations for Increased Deaths</h2>
<p>
It has become clear that in Italy and in other parts of Europe, there is an increase in death rates. We know this because the Europeans provide near real-time mortality statistics. But there are other explanations than 5G or the virus, such as:
</p><ul>
<li>Just as with SARS, doctors are aggressively treating people on the basis of the positive test, including intubation, steroids, antiviral drugs, and other unproven medications. We will likely find evidence of serious harm afterwards.
</li><li>Doctors are intubating people because of fear of infection via leaky oxygen masks. This is really malpractice, treating the patient for the benefit of the medical staff, rather than for the benefit of the patient. And the fear was found to be unfounded with SARS.
</li><li>Isolating old, frail people from their family, and even from nurses, who are now hidden behind PPE, is likely to hasten their demise.
</li><li>People are being told to stay away from the ER, or are deciding for themselves, based on fear of the virus. So, when some people do get really sick, they will show up at the hospital in much worse shape, and may even die unnecessarily.
</li><li>Lombardy in Italy, their epicentre, is one of the most polluted parts of Europe. This problem also occurs in Wuhan. Air pollution is not a constant, but gets better and worse as weather conditions change. And an increase in air pollution could explain some deaths.
</li><li>Patients whose deaths were blamed on COVID-19, particularly in Italy, are extremely old (average age 80) and infirm. Of the first 2,003 deaths examined almost half had 3 or more pre-existing health conditions and only 3 deaths were in people with none. China, with a much younger population, also shows above average ages for those diagnosed with illness and, particularly, with deaths. They are the most vulnerable to increases in air pollution and aggressive treatment.

The average number in the UK was 2.7. In New York, a survey of 5700 hospitalized COVID-19 patients showed that 89% had two or more pre-existing health conditions.

<h2>What is EMF?</h2>
<p>
Electro-magnetic fields, or electro-magnetic radiation, are vibrations that naturally occur at a wide variety of frequencies. The highest frequency (most rapid vibrations) are Gamma Rays, followed by X Rays, Ultraviolet light, the visible light spectrum from violet down to red, and then the radio or microwave spectrum. Clearly the greatest damage comes from the highest frequencies, and radio and microwave have the lowest frequencies, so on this basis, should have the lowest impact. Even visible light has much higher frequencies than radio waves, and we are bathed in it all the time, although with enough energy, that too can be damaging as any sunburned person can attest (although most of the damage probably comes from the invisible ultraviolet).
</p><p>
Energy of EMF is also found in the amplitude of the wave (how high the wave is as opposed to how far apart the peaks are). It is true that even radio/microwaves can have a lot of energy with high amplitude waves. This means that a microwave oven, operating at high power, would cause massive damage to the human body (which is why it shuts off automatically when the door is opened). By comparison, cellphones operate at a tiny fraction, usually 1/10,000th or 1/100,000th of the energy of a microwave oven.
</p><p>
So, any EMF can be damaging if the amount of energy in the wave is high enough.

</p><h2>Is EMF Radiation?</h2>
<p>
Radiation is usually thought of as the damaging types of radiation coming from nuclear bombs, power plants or nuclear waste. This is more properly called ionizing radiation. Radiation itself just means any energy, whether waves like EMF, or energetic particles, that travels through space. Generally it spreads out with distance, hence the name radiation.
</p><p>
The highest frequency forms of EMF, Gamma Rays and X Rays, are ionizing, and thus can permanently alter atoms by removing electrons. Lower frequency forms, from Ultraviolet down to radio waves, cannot do this.

</p><h2>Can Microwave Emissions Cook Your Brain?</h2>
<p>
Almost the entire range of wireless communications that we are familiar with – cellular, WiFi, 3G, 4G, 5G, PCS, LTE, GSM – falls into the microwave range, which extends from 300 MHz (0.3GHz) to 300 GHz. But to conclude from this that our brains are going to be fried or, rather, microwaved, is an absurdity.
</p><p>
Modern wireless devices usually transmit at less than 1 Watt of power, whereas microwave ovens operate at 600-1200 Watts. Not only that, but wireless communications tries to minimize transmit power. A recent paper found that wireless devices in rural areas generally operated at about 2% of peak power, and in more urban areas at about 1%. In terms of watts, 0.01 to 0.02 watts. Network transmitters (towers) transmit at higher power, but the power level is calculated so that what is received by your phone (and therefore may be absorbed by your body) is at the lowest power level that will provide error free communication.
</p><p>
The main reason for wireless devices to use the lowest possible power may be surprising. Obviously the power bill of the phone companies is reduced if they transmit to devices at the lowest feasible power. And the battery life of your phone, is only as good as it is, because of tight power management. But the real reason is interference. If there are many devices simultaneously transmitting, using the lowest possible power (i.e. the lowest that allows communications without excessive errors that could garble transmissions) then you have less interference between communications, and can get more users on the system, and therefore make more money.
</p><p>
To say that long exposure to power levels that are thousands of times lower than a microwave oven will eventually cook your brain, is like saying that a cook in a restaurant, who can feel the heat (infrared EMF) from an oven while working, will eventually get cooked by that oven. It is an absurdity. This is not to say that there should be no precautions for engineers and technicians who work in high RF emission environments, nor that 5G antennas should be arranged without minimizing human exposure, nor that government regulators should not limit the maximum power of devices that will be close to the human head. There are also concerns with certain high frequencies resonating with functions in the human body. This is also worth investigating.

</p><h2>5G Cannot Explain Patterns of Death</h2>
<p>
5G is currently in the early stages, and there are only relatively small installations. At the higher frequencies the radius of transmission of one cell is quite small, measured in tens or hundreds of meters (yards) rather than in kilometers or miles, as for a standard cellular tower. This means that 5G will cover dense pedestrian areas at first, then move into indoor applications, such as shopping malls. It will be a long time before higher frequencies covers highways, suburban areas and rural areas.

<p>David Crowe<br>June 5, 2020<br>Version 4</p>
<p>
Masks are being widely recommended as protection against the COVID-19 virus, both to protect the wearer from infection, and to protect others from wearers who do not know that they are infected. Trouble is, most of the scientific evidence and recommendations are against the use of masks by the general public. Despite this they are increasingly mandated. In some places you cannot walk around outside without a mask, in others you cannot go inside a public space without a mask. Workers are often mandated to wear them. And now airline passengers, no matter the length of their flight.

</p><h2>Evidence for the use of Masks</h2>
<p>
The strongest evidence for the use of masks is a Cochrane Collaboration review. Seven studies from the era of SARS found that mask-wearing was highly effective in case-control studies, although this type of study is subject to bias because the control arm is simply a representative group, unlike in a placebo controlled trial (very difficult with masks). For example, if the cases are sicker than the controls, they may behave differently, including in wearing a mask.
</p><p>
Of the seven papers, five studied only health-care workers, and this article does not question whether health care workers should wear masks. This leaves only two papers. One provided no socio-economic or health data on the case versus control groups, leaving open the possibility that there were significant differences. The last study confirmed this, the cases (who had been diagnosed with ‘probable’ SARS, i.e. without a SARS test) were significantly sicker before SARS than the controls, which makes sense because people who were diagnosed with SARS tended to have pre-existing health conditions, just as is found with COVID-19. Mask wearing and hand washing were more common in controls, resulting in the conclusion that they were protective. But attending farmer’s markets was also ‘protective’. In reality this probably just reflects the better health of the control group. Really sick people may avoid the use of masks because it interferes with their breathing when they already have problems. This possibility was not considered by either paper.
</p><p>
So, in conclusion there are two papers in this review that claimed that wearing masks was protective against SARS, but one admits that the control group was significantly healthier than the case group, and the other paper is silent on this important source of bias.
</p><blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>
There are also the hamsters, however. No, Hong Kong University did not find a source of hamster sized surgical masks, but in an unpublished paper, they describe putting a surgical mask over the air flow between a cage of RNA positive hamsters and a cage of RNA negative hamsters, and documenting that a higher proportion of the RNA-negative hamsters became RNA-positive when there was no mask over the airflow. It is not clear why the researchers believe their studies can be extrapolated directly to people. Although newspaper articles claim that the paper has been released, not even the Hong Kong University press release, the institution where the work was performed, provided any details about its location.
</p><blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>
More recently a paper in Lancet identified 172 observational studies (not randomized trials) that they claimed supported social distancing or mask wearing. Of the 44 they examined in detail, 35 studied health care workers, 8 studied close contacts (e.g. a household with an ill person, traced contacts of a person with a positive test) and only 3 studied public spaces (one studied all three, hence the numeric discrepancy). Of those 3 papers one studied distance versus infection risk on airplanes, and another was included in the Cochrane study, above. The third paper, as yet not peer-reviewed and published, was focussed on contact tracing, but did note that of two couples discovered to be both positive through contact tracing (out of 404 close contacts of 9 COVID-19 cases), one took a lot of precautions (mask, separate bedroom, separate bathroom) while the other did not, lending no clarity to the mask debate.

</blockquote>
<p>
A heavily promoted <a href="https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/10.7326/M20-2567">paper in the Annals of Internal Medicine</a> (Ads on Twitter paid for by McMaster University in Canada) claims in the title that “Cloth Masks May Prevent Transmission of COVID-19”. They admit that, “cloth does not stop isolated virions”, but claim that since virus particles are always attached to droplets, that research on transmission of bacteria can be useful. Many of the masks tested in experiments they referenced had 3 to 6 layers of cloth. They also admit that the only randomized trial (discussed below) showed that cloth masks increased influenza-like illnesses in health care workers who wore them for long periods of time. They ignore the Korean research (also discussed below) that concluded that, “Neither surgical nor cotton masks effectively filtered SARSâ€“CoV-2 during coughs by infected patients”. Finally they conclude their promotion of cotton masks by admitting that, “Whether wearing a mask of any sort in a community context protects oneself or others is unknown”. Maybe this paper should be in a section of its own, “Papers that want masks to work but cannot prove it”.

</blockquote>

<h2>Evidence against the use of Masks</h2>
<p>
A very recent review of the literature that was published in the CDC journal, “Emerging Infectious Diseases” did not find evidence that handwashing or masks were protective against influenza. Masks did not help infected people reduce their risk of infecting others, nor reduce the risk of uninfected people contracting influenza.
<br>
</p><blockquote>
“In this review, we did not find evidence to support a protective effect of personal protective measures or environmental measures in reducing influenza transmission…Hand hygiene is a widely used intervention and has been shown to effectively reduce the transmission of gastrointestinal infections and respiratory infections. However, in our systematic review, updating the findings of Wong et al., we did not find evidence of a major effect of hand hygiene on laboratory-confirmed influenza virus transmission...We did not find evidence that surgical-type face masks are effective in reducing laboratory-confirmed influenza transmission, either when worn by infected persons (source control) or by persons in the general community to reduce their susceptibility...It is essential to note that the mechanisms of person-to-person transmission in the community have not been fully determined. Controversy remains over the role of transmission through fine-particle aerosols.”

<p>
A Korean study put masks on COVID-19 infected people and did not reduce the transmission of viral RNA when patients coughed with a mask on.

<h2>Adverse Consequences of Masks</h2>
<p>
Adverse consequences of masks are most obvious among health-care workers, where use is more controlled, but members of the general public who voluntarily wear masks for extended periods of time may experience similar problems.
</p><p>
A study in BMJ showed that people who were told to wear cloth masks for extended period of time (for purposes of this study) had higher rates of influenza-like illness than other health care workers but could decide if and when to wear masks, and higher rates than those wearing surgical masks. Even among health care workers, mask wearing could be counter-productive.
<br>
</p><blockquote>
“The rates of all infection outcomes were highest in the cloth mask arm, with the rate of ILI [influenza-like illness] statistically significantly higher in the cloth mask arm (relative risk (RR)=13.00, 95% CI 1.69 to 100.07) compared with the medical mask arm. Cloth masks also had significantly higher rates of ILI compared with the control arm [workers who followed standard practice, which could sometimes include mask wearing]. An analysis by mask use showed ILI (RR=6.64, 95% CI 1.45 to 28.65) and laboratory-confirmed virus (RR=1.72, 95% CI 1.01 to 2.94) were significantly higher in the cloth masks group compared with the medical masks group. Penetration of cloth masks by particles was almost 97% and medical masks 44%.”

</blockquote>

<p>A study from Singapore found an increased risk of headaches, indicative of oxygen deprivation, among health care workers. This may or may not apply to the general public who generally wear masks that are less tight fitting (and therefore less effective).
</p><blockquote>
“A total of 158 healthcare workers participated in the study. Majority [126/158 (77.8%)] were aged 21-35 years. Participants included nurses [102/158 (64.6%)], doctors [51/158 (32.3%)], and paramedical staff [5/158 (3.2%)]. Pre-existing primary headache diagnosis was present in about a third [46/158 (29.1%)] of respondents. Those based at the emergency department had higher average daily duration of combined PPE exposure compared to those working in isolation wards [7.0 vs 5.2 hours] or medical ICU …</blockquote></div>

		<h2 id="000000">00:00:00</h2>

<div><p>Welcome to Signals And Threads, in-depth conversations about every layer of the tech stack from Jane Street. I’m Ron Minsky. </p><p> Today, we’re going to have a conversation about programming language design with Leo White. Leo works in our compilers team here at Jane Street, and he works mostly on what’s called the frontend of the compiler, which means he spends a lot of time thinking about language features and about the type system that supports those language features, and in particular, he does that work in OCaml, which is the programming language we use on a day-to-day basis. </p><p> So, Leo, to get started, I’m curious, can you tell us a little bit about how you got involved in all of this? How you got involved in programming language design, in the first place?</p></div>

<h2 id="0000400">00:00:40.0</h2>

<div><p>I had some interest in programming languages from a young age. I started programming at 11 or something, and then I think I was fairly interested in how these mysterious things were created. The most formative thing I can think of in this regard, is between my first and second years at university, I remember reading Benjamin Pierce’s <a href="https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~bcpierce/tapl/"><em>Types and Programming Languages</em></a>. That really clicked. I just thought that stuff was great and I just really wanted work on it, and explore those ideas. </p><p> So, I think that’s kind of one of the main things that got me into it. I knew I wanted to do some programming language stuff, I started doing a PhD in that area. It was more about compilation than programming language design, and I was working on a source-to-source C compiler, and I was writing that compiler in OCaml, because OCaml had a good library for reading C files, and I already knew Standard ML, because it’s what they teach you in the first year at Cambridge. So, anyways, I was using OCaml to write this compiler, and I realized that there was a language feature that I wanted to have that would make it easier for me to write this C compiler, and since I kind of hated the work I was doing on the C compiler and was not that interested in it, I procrastinated by adding this feature to OCaml instead. And that’s kind of how I got into writing code for the OCaml compiler. So, I was writing, this language feature and went through the process of trying to upstream it, and whilst I was doing that and my PhD was coming to an end, Anil Madhavapeddy was looking around for people to join OCaml Labs, which was this new project to work on the OCaml compiler that Jane Street was kind of funding in Cambridge. So, he was trying to look for people to work on the OCaml compiler and suddenly this Cambridge address shows up with the implementing language features for OCaml and so he thought, well, I should go and see this person. So, he got in touch with me. And that’s kind of how I started working at OCaml Labs as an RA after having finished my PhD.</p></div>

<h2 id="0002195">00:02:19.5</h2>

<p>It’s by the way worth noting that most people have the wisdom to not immediately go and dive into adding features to languages that they’re just starting to use, and in particular, diving into the type system. I think when Anil saw someone who was willing to just going in and add a new type system feature, he was pretty excited.</p>

<h2 id="0002346">00:02:34.6</h2>

<p>Yes. I did not realize at the time that this wasn’t something that you just did. Yes, I was somewhat under-supervised in my PhD and clearly, no one told me that this is a terrible idea, and a bad way to spend your time. So, I just went ahead and did it instead, and I really enjoyed it. I mean, it’s quite a terrible…like, the type system is hard to dive into. I would not recommend doing it without some assistance.</p>

<h2 id="0002568">00:02:56.8</h2>

<p>The thing you mentioned about how you got involved in OCaml, is the thing that’s always worried me a little bit about how languages are designed, which is to say, languages are almost inevitably designed by people who write compilers, and so, they go around and look at the features they would like for writing compilers and go ahead and add them to the language, and I always wondered, like, how much of a bias is this in how our languages are designed?</p>

<h2 id="0003178">00:03:17.8</h2>

<p>I would say, not much of one mostly, because that is probably a fair accusation of OCaml, which is very nice for writing compilers and has all the things you would want for writing a compiler, but that is not true of most languages. Most languages are kind of horrible to write compilers in, so I don’t think it’s applying there.</p>

<h2 id="0003327">00:03:32.7</h2>

<p>So, you got excited about programming language design from reading <em>Types and Programming Languages</em>, which is Benjamin Pierce’s extremely famous book in this area, or at least extremely famous in an extremely narrow group of people, and you’ve been doing it now for quite a while. Some of that work during your PhD. Some at OCaml Labs, and a bunch of it here, in the intermediate time. What do you find exciting about language design? Why do you like it?</p>

<h2 id="0003550">00:03:55.0</h2>

<p>One of the main things I think I like about language design is that it sits at an interesting intersection between some very interesting pure mathematics, especially on the type system design side of things, and a more aesthetic, kind of, design style. A lot of it is about trying to find things that fit within the mathematical constraints, but are also a design that people like aesthetically and enjoy using.</p>

<h2 id="0004166">00:04:16.6</h2>

<p>And this is one of the real challenges of programming language design. It is really not, at its heart, a scientific enterprise, or at least, not at the end. This is a thing you often hear programming language people complain about, is the fact that they can’t do any proper studies, or rather, whether they can or can’t do it, that in practice, that is not how the field is driven.</p>

<h2 id="0004365">00:04:36.5</h2>

<p>Some people do try and do studies in how effective a programming language is, but it kind of hits up against all the things that make it hard to do experiments in the social sciences. It’s just seems like, in principle, you can manage it, but the experiments are just very hard to do, right? What you really need to do is get a load of professional programmers to agree to use all these different languages to solve the same problems for a prolonged period of time, and clearly this isn’t going to happen.</p>

<h2 id="0004566">00:04:56.6</h2>

<p>Yeah, it does seem completely and utterly hopeless to me because, if the things you care about are what you can do in a programming language, with large groups of people, solving hard problems, with significant amounts of time being devoted to it, which seems like, to me, at least, the interesting problem, and I think, a problem that a lot of programming languages are not even motivated by, you just have no hope. Like the kind of experiments people can run in practice, are like, they grab the thing they have at hand, which is usually a collection of sophomores, and then they study the thing that they can, which is something like how easy is it to understand the very first errors they see in their language or like, how well do they do when they try and do stuff in their first few weeks or maybe few months of working at it. And that just doesn’t get at the actual thing you care about when you think about what makes programming effective in the real world.</p>

<h2 id="0005434">00:05:43.4</h2>

<div><p>This kind of genuinely bothers quite a lot of people, I think, who work in programming languages. They really would much prefer that it were a proper science. It’s much better thought of as a kind of intersection between some mathematics and design. </p><p> And those are both things that we know how to study, right? The scientific method is not the only approach to knowledge. With mathematics, you can try to prove useful theorems and interesting properties, and people successfully do research in design disciplines like, my favorite example is really architecture, which I think is a very similar area to programming language design, in that it’s kind of constrained by mathematics. You know, you have to make sure the building stays up and also, is interesting from a design perspective. You know, you want to make buildings that people enjoy being in and looking at, and so on.</p></div>

<h2 id="0006249">00:06:24.9</h2>

<p>And there’s more than just the raw structural things you have to check. When you think about the design of a building, you think about what are transit times, and people do all sorts of studies to try get feels for how effective it is, but in the end, no one thinks that the final way to figure out whether a building is good is to do a randomized control trial, where you’re like, you make four different buildings and you have this, this and this. You have four equivalent businesses that you sit in the four different buildings and you see how it goes. And I think the scale of the economic investment required, I’m not sure if it’s not quite as absurd or a little more absurd to do the programming language equivalent, but it’s up there.</p>

<h2 id="0007013">00:07:01.3</h2>

<p>I think that that’s a better way of looking at programming language design, as a discipline.</p>

<h2 id="0007068">00:07:06.8</h2>

<p>You know, there are two ways of handling design problems. One is, you can solve them in the market, right? You can, you know, go off and have people go and design programming languages and see which are successful, and we have that down. There’s a whole system for doing that. And then there’s an academic equivalent of this, and a lot of the work on OCaml, in particular, happens in a context which includes a lot of academic staff. Do you have a feel for how you would make things like evaluation of papers different than it is now in order to accommodate for this?</p>

<h2 id="0007335">00:07:33.5</h2>

<div><p>I don’t have concrete suggestions. I’ve always wanted to, actually seriously, look into disciplines like architecture and so on, and look at how they, I mean they have journals. They have assessment of things. There must be mechanisms by which they do this, but I’ve never actually sat down and put serious time into seeing what that is. </p><p> I’m kind of more struck by the fact that when you’re at, say ICFP, which is the main functional …</p></div></div></div>

<p>Good stories develop their meaning across many levels. To summarize them into statements is to void them of their images, metaphors, allegories. The meanings and knowledge are not in the summary, but in the art itself. Knowledge is gained as those works of art <em>work</em> upon us. [...]</p><p>Without an education of stories, it is not only difficult to build your intuition, it is difficult to learn how to learn, and difficult to reason about virtue. Fairy tales and Bildungsroman stories work so well because maturity is almost impossible to transmit rationally, but is a very compelling concept aesthetically. It is learned by seeing others grow the courage to make meaningful decisions, and accept the duty and power and consequences that flow from them. It teaches a mastery that cannot simply be taught through abstract school lessons. [...]</p><p>A mythological education is distinct from the common school subjects. It builds in the mind intuition for second-order effects, for the first lesson a child learns from one hundred stories is that every thing you do will have unintended consequences, something years of schoolwork fails to teach. Myths give us shared art and common culture — a set of characters with which we can play in and enjoy together. In any culture rich with myths, their vocabulary is enlarged far beyond words, to allegories and metaphors.</p>

October 23, 2020 | https://spotify.design/article/how-spotify-organises-work-in-figma-to-improve-collaboration | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://spotify.design/article/how-spotify-organises-work-in-figma-to-improve-collaboration">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>Spotify Design recently migrated to Figma. We're excited to open up the music box and describe how we've shaped the tool to suit our needs and culture at Spotify. But in this article, we're not discussing why or how we moved. Instead, this is where we're going to geek out over file structures.</p><div><p>Check out our Figma Ways of Working above, and have a read of this article to understand some of the rationale behind it. We hope this information will be useful for other design teams seeking more organisation for their work in Figma.</p><h3>Defining our goal</h3><p>At Spotify Design, we actively encourage everyone to explore problems together, get inspired by one another and find harmony across design solutions. So as we were planning the migration, we set a goal to boost this effort and guide us through the whole process: <strong>organise our work in ways that improve collaboration between designers.</strong> New tools such as Abstract and Figma offer the ability to work together like never before, but allowing multiple people into the same file doesn’t automatically lead to better collaboration. Our files would need to be organised in a way that is visible and discoverable by everyone. After all, you can’t collaborate on work that you can’t find.</p><p>This is especially true in organisations like Spotify. Our squad model is optimised for autonomy, which is beneficial for many reasons but can result in designers working in isolation. Not only are we spread out amongst cross-functional squads, but we’re also spread across multiple product areas—which we call “business units”—and numerous offices around the world.</p><h3>New process, new challenges&nbsp;</h3><p>In our pursuit of greater visibility of work, we needed to be mindful of how we impacted speed and effort—two important factors in a designer’s workflow. Increasing visibility can be detrimental as it introduces more people, more structure, more rules, and more thinking to simple tasks. Our decisions could easily increase the effort required to keep work organised or make it slower to navigate to files, potentially resulting in fewer sketches, prototypes, and iterations. The challenge was to balance our need for both visibility and speed.</p></div><div><p>Previous attempts at storing our design files helped us understand how the migration might play out if we weren’t thoughtful enough. Some of the things we anticipated when designing the Figma workflow were:</p><ul><li><p><strong>People naturally optimise for speed</strong>, creating personal workflows and carving out private spaces for themselves or their squad. While standards can improve speed in the long run, individual workflows seem more immediately beneficial.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p><strong>People interpret structure in their own way</strong> using various mental models—teams, products, projects, people—and standards rarely develop organically. Guidelines have to be clear and intuitive to break through individual instincts.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>While some people iterate on features and document specs within the same file, others separate them into different documents. <strong>Seemingly small decisions flow into processes with engineers and PMs and define their understanding of how to find work</strong>.</p></li></ul><p>We had to take every detail of these behaviours into consideration before moving forward.</p><h3>Ways of working&nbsp;</h3><p>So we had a goal, and we knew the challenges that lay ahead, but how did we tackle the problem? Design Ops used our <a href="https://spotify.design/articles/2019-10-17/dialling-up-the-joy-turning-down-the-pain-design-ops-at-spotify/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>trusted working group (WG) model</u></a> and pulled together a crew of designers from across Spotify that were able to represent the design teams in their business units.</p><p>To start, the group defined a set of principles that reflected our objectives and would guide our ideas:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Unifying:</strong> People should be organically exposed to other relevant work, regardless of where they sit in the org.</p></li><li><p><strong>Discoverable: </strong>Work should have a clear home. There should be no lingo, no hunting for files, and no getting lost.</p></li><li><p><strong>Manageable:</strong> Spaces shouldn’t become so busy that files aren’t easy to organise and access.</p></li><li><p><strong>Sustainable:</strong> The number of teams and projects shouldn’t grow to an untenable size, become irrelevant, or need to be frequently changed.</p></li><li><p><strong>Autonomous:</strong> Each team should be empowered to diverge from our recommendations, acknowledging that one solution may not work for everyone.</p></li></ul><p>From there, we explored a spectrum of options that aimed to balance visibility and speed. Some increased the size of spaces where more people would work alongside each other, while others narrowed them down to smaller definitions with just a couple of designers working side-by-side. With a set of options, a stack of printouts, and even Figma prototypes, we conducted rounds of research with designers in our business units. Yes, we got <i>that </i>nerdy. We had file structure design workshops!&nbsp;</p><p>Here’s an example of some of the workshop material:</p></div><div><p>The workshops allowed us to identify the most common mental models, test the intuitiveness of our ideas and give everyone a voice. Perhaps most importantly, it gave the design team some empathy for the problem we were trying to solve. We can be passionate about our personal workflows (we use them every day!) so sharing the problem with the team helped them recognise how differently everyone can think about these things.</p><h3>The outcome</h3><p>This process led us to the following three key decisions:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Teams </strong>will be organised by the products we build.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p><strong>Projects</strong> will be organised by a product’s features or feature sets.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p><strong>Specs</strong> will be centralised inside a single project in each team. </p></li></ol></div><div><p>Organising <strong>Teams</strong> in this way communicates our expansive product suite at Spotify such as our mobile app, Spotify Kids, Ad Studio, Spotify for Artists, Anchor, and many other external and internal products. From our org overview you can immediately tell that design work from the whole company is right at your fingertips. The structure guides designers from different business units and squads to work together in the same space when designing for the same product, and it enables us to cleanly map our <a href="https://spotify.design/articles/2019-12-16/reimagining-design-systems-at-spotify/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Encore (design system)</a> libraries to each team.</p><p>These same attributes are reflected in the Team structure where a product's set of features are communicated through <strong>Projects</strong>. Emojis help us distinguish between specs, feature explorations, new initiatives, and a playground for quick ideas, and each Project is usually filled with work from only three or four designers so people still have a sense of their own, personal space.</p><p>Lastly, we took the opportunity to reconsider how and where we document our <strong>specs</strong>—the screens, states, and flows that represent our source of truth. Our decision didn’t immediately feel intuitive to the design team, but we held a strong conviction that its value would soon become apparent.</p></div><div><p>“Where’s the latest design?” is a message we send and receive far too often. Similar to how we’re bringing visibility to exploration work through our new Team and Project structures, we also wanted to pull specs out from individual files and into the open. Each Team (i.e. product) now has a single spec file, and within those files are pages that represent each of our features. As a designer hones in on a solution, they move their work into these centralised specs to document their decisions.&nbsp;</p><p>Like the software we ship, these specs constantly evolve as old screens replace new ones, and components update to take on new forms and functionality. It’s a representation that we are all working together towards a unified product, sharing patterns and solutions with each other. And there is no "looking at the wrong thing," because there is only one place to look.</p><h3>Where it all comes together&nbsp;</h3><p>Finally, the WG developed a <a href="https://www.figma.com/community/file/832911648132248625/Spotify-Ways-of-Working" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">playbook</a> and incorporated this into the training we hosted when we onboarded designers onto Figma. The WG needed to do some polite policing, regularly checking the tool to do some light housekeeping—checking on rogue teams (often with random squad names), pinging people on Slack when we saw diversions to the conventions, and hosting demos to show people how to set up things correctly. We created a #figma channel for designers to ask us questions and even added some external folk from the Figma product team.</p></div><div><p>We have now been using the new structure for three months and so far, so good. For the most part, designers have adhered to the system, and we have seen instances of teams across the organisation collaborating on products, rather than hiding their work inside their orgs. We believe this will have the impact we set out to achieve, and we’ll continue to iterate as we receive feedback and notice emerging trends.</p><p>If you're going through the process of creating your own organisation system, remember to use your design team’s superpowers to help guide your structure—research how your own team works, test ideas with designers, and prototype solutions before agreeing on a structure that works for your team culture.&nbsp;</p><p>—

    <p>I have recently become very interested in functional programming - using pure functional languages such as Haskell, as well as functional programming in JavaScript. One of the main areas of study that is often cited as significant for functional programmers is <strong>lambda calculus</strong>.</p>

<p>In this article I want to look at what lambda calculus is, why you might want to learn about it, and explain the key concepts and the terminology of lambda calculus using both lambda syntax and ‘equivalent’ JavaScript code snippets.</p>

<p>If after reading this you are interested in learning more about functional programming in JavaScript, I recommend this Udemy course (affiliate link):</p>

<p><a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/link?id=5FPU6FRy5w4&amp;offerid=507388.1537962&amp;type=2&amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.udemy.com%2Fcourse%2Ffunctional-programming-for-beginners-with-javascript%2F">Functional Programming For Beginners With JavaScript</a></p>



<p>There are a few reasons to learn lambda calculus, the main ones I can think of are:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong>It embodies some of the most important concepts of functional programming</strong></p>

    <p>For example, pure functions, unary functions, currying.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>The internals of many functional programming languages such as Haskell, are heavily based on lambda calculus</strong></p>

    <p>Understanding lambda calculus will help you to understand these languages.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Many concepts from lambda calculus are applicable to general purpose languages such as JavaScript.</strong></p>

    <p>Concepts such as pure functions, unary functions and currying are used in many general purpose programming languages, and are often used in functional JavaScript.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>It is interesting</strong></p>

    <p>Lambda calculus is an interesting area of mathematics, and is relatively accessible to those with a minimal maths background.</p>
  </li>

<p>Lambda calculus was invented by the mathematician <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alonzo_Church">Alonzo Church</a> in the 1930s, and is what is known as a ‘computational model’. By that, I mean that it is a system which can be used to encode and compute algorithmic problems.</p>

<p>The computational model most of us are familiar with is the Turing machine. While lambda calculus is rather different to the Turing machine in its approach to computation, the two are formally equivalent - ie. any problem that can by solved using a Turing machine can be solved using lambda calculus, and vice versa.</p>

<p>That is to say, lambda calculus can be used to solve any problem that can be computed using a Turing machine (so anything that anyone has ever programmed with a computer)!</p>
<h2 id="lambda-calculus-basics">Lambda calculus basics</h2>

<p>Lambda calculus is very minimalistic in its rules/axioms. It is made up of just 3 basic components, or <strong>lambda terms</strong>:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Variable</strong> - a named token used in a function, which will be replaced by concrete arguments when the function is applied.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Abstraction</strong> - a function, made up of a head and a body separated by a ‘\(.\)’</p>

    <ul>
      <li>The head is a lambda followed by a variable name.</li>
      <li>The body is an expression.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Application</strong> - a function invokation.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>An <strong>expression</strong> is a variable, an abstraction, an application, or any combination of these.</p>

<p>In addition, parentheses are used in lambda calculus to indicate the order of evaluation.</p>

<p>This is all we get in lambda calculus! It is quite amazing that using these 3 lambda terms we calculate pretty much anything!</p>

<p>It is worth noting the absence of any of the constructs of basic arithmetic, such as numbers, addition, subtraction, multiplication, division etc - these are not within the basic axioms of lambda calculus.</p>

<p>Numbers and arithmetic operations can be defined in terms of lambda calculus via <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Church_encoding">Church Encoding</a> (which is outside the scope of this article). Rather than working from first principles every time we need them, we can choose to use numbers and basic arithmetic operators for convenience.</p>

<h2 id="a-simple-example---the-identity-function">A simple example - the identity function</h2>

<p>The following function is known as the identity function, it takes a value and returns that same value.</p>

<p>In JavaScript we can easily define and execute this function:</p>

<pre><code>const identity = x =&gt; x;
identity(3) // 3
</code></pre>

<p>We can write the same function using lambda calculus as follows:</p><p>

\[\lambda x . x\]

</p><p>In the above:</p>
<ul>
  <li>\(x\) is a variable.</li>
  <li>
    <p>\(\lambda x . x\) is an abstraction.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>\(\lambda x\) is the head of the abstraction</li>
      <li>\(x\) is the body of the abstraction.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>To perform an application, ie. apply the function to a concrete argument, we use the following syntax:</p><p>

\[(\lambda x . x) \ 3\]

\[[x := 3]\]

\[3\]

</p><p>In the above, the \([x := 3]\) syntax indicates that we are going to substitute all instances of \(x\) in the function with \(3\). The above process is known as beta reduction, which I will talk more about now.</p>

<h2 id="beta-reduction">Beta reduction</h2>

<p>In JavaScript when we invoke a (pure) function with its arguments, the function gets evaluated and it returns the evaluated result:</p>

<pre><code>const f = (x, y) =&gt; x(y);

f(z =&gt; z + 1, 3); // 4
</code></pre>

<p>Here, <code>f</code> takes 2 arguments - a function <code>x</code> and a value <code>y</code>, and calls <code>x</code> with <code>y</code> as an argument.</p>

<p>In lambda calculus, the process of applying concrete arguments to an abstraction, and reducing the resulting expression is known as <strong>beta reduction</strong>.</p>

<p>The equivalent to the above JavaScript function <code>f</code>, when written with lambda calculus, is:</p><p>

\[\lambda x y . x y\]

</p><p>This time, we have an application in the body of the abstraction: \(x y\), this means ‘call \(x\) with \(y\) as an argument’. We can pass arguments to the abstraction and beta reduce it as follows:</p><p>

\[(\lambda x y . x y) \ (\lambda z . z + 1) \ 3\]

\[[x := \lambda z . z + 1]\]

\[(\lambda y . (\lambda z . z + 1) \ y) \ 3\]

\[[z := y]\]

\[(\lambda y . y + 1) \ 3\]

\[[y := 3]\]

\[4\]

</p><p><strong>Beta normal form</strong> is the most simplified form of an expression, ie. when it cannot be beta reduced the terms in an expression any further. In the above example \(4\) is the beta normal form of the application.</p>

<h2 id="alpha-equivalence">Alpha Equivalence</h2>

<p>In JavaScript, renaming a function’s parameters has no effect on the behaviour of the function.</p>

<pre><code>// The following are equivalent.
const myFunc1 = (x, y) =&gt; x * x;
const myFunc2 = (y, x) =&gt; y * y;
</code></pre>

<p>Similarly, in lambda calculus renaming variables within a function also has no effect. We say that abstractions which differ only in their variable names are <strong>alpha equivalent</strong>.</p>

<p>The following is an example of 2 abstractions which are alpha equivalent:</p><p>

\[\lambda x y . xx\]

\[\lambda y x . yy\]

</p><h2 id="bound-and-free-variables">Bound and free variables</h2>

<p>In JavaScript, the return value of a function can be calculated us both its parameters, and variables which the function closes over:</p>

<pre><code>const z = 5;
// z, in the context of our function, is a free variable.
const f = (x, y) =&gt; z + (x * y);

f(2, 3); // 11 === z + 6
</code></pre>

<p>Similarly, lambda calculus abstractions can make use of both variables which are defined in the head of the abstraction, and other, ‘unknown’ variables which are not. In lambda calculus:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Bound variables</strong> are variables used in an abstraction which appear in the head of the abstraction.</li>
  <li><strong>Free variables</strong> are variables used in an abstraction which do not appear in the head, their value is taken to be unknown within the context of the abstraction.</li>
</ul>

<p>If we express the JavaScript function defined above in lambda calculus, we get:</p><p>

\[\lambda x y . z + (x * y)\]

</p><p>And now applying arguments to this function and beta reducing it:</p><p>

\[(\lambda x y . z + (x * y)) \ 2 \ 3\]

\[[x := 2]\]

\[(\lambda y . z + (2 * y)) \ 3\]

\[[y := 3]\]

\[z + 6\]

</p><p>The notable difference here is that in our JavaScript function, we assigned a value to <code>z</code>, whereas in the lambda calculus, we just evaluated the function as far as we could without knowing \(z\).</p>

<p>Even though it is not a numerical result, \(z + 6\) is the beta normal form of this application.</p>

<h2 id="unary-functions-and-currying">Unary functions and currying</h2>

<p>Up until now we have been making a simplification, and viewing lambda functions as functions which take one or more arguments and return a single value.</p>

<p>This is <em>not actually correct</em>.</p>

<p>Every lambda function takes a single argument and returns a single result, and this type of function is know as a <strong>unary function</strong>.</p><p>

\[\lambda x y z . x * y * z\]

</p><p>Is actually shorthand for</p><p>

\[\lambda x . (\lambda y .  (\lambda z . x * y * z))\]

</p><p>This is function with a single parameter \(x\), which when invoked returns another function with a single parameter \(y\), which when invoked returns another function with a single parameter \(z\), which when invoked returns the value of \(x * y * z\)</p>

<p>In JavaScript, the above function looks like:</p>

<pre><code>const f = x =&gt; y =&gt; z =&gt; x * y * z;
</code></pre>

<p>If you have done any functional programming in JavaScript then this way of writing a function may look familiar. Taking a function which takes many arguments, and breaking it down into a series of unary functions (which each take a single argument) is known as <strong>currying</strong>.</p>

<p>We can invoke the above function either by passing all of its arguments and immediately obtaining the final result, or, we can first create a more specific function by passing only some arguments, and then call this function later to get the final result.</p>

<pre><code>// Call our function with 3 arguments.
f(2)(3)(4); // 24

// Call our function with 2 arguments to create a more specialised function.
const multiplyBySix = f(2)(3);

multiplyBySix(4); // 24
</code></pre>

<p>In JavaScript we have the choice to either use curried unary functions, or functions which take more than one argument.</p>

<p>In lambda calculus, all functions are curried unary functions, despite that fact that we often use the aforementioned shorthand which makes them appear as if they take multiple arguments.</p>



<p>Just as not all JavaScript function calls can be evaluated to produce a value, not all lambda functions reduce to a beta normal form upon application. Consider the following, somewhat contrived piece of JavaScript:</p>

<pre><code>const f = x =&gt; x(x);
f(f);
</code></pre>

<p>This is a little confusing. We define a function <code>f</code>, which takes a function <code>x</code> and calls it with itself as an argument. On the next line, we call <code>f</code> with itself, which will recursively continue to call f with itself, and mayhem ensues.</p>

<p>If you execute the above code, you will get a max call stack size exceeded error. Conceptually we can think of what happens as something like:</p>

<pre><code>f(f(f(f(f(f(...)))))); // and so on, until we reach the maximum call stack size.
</code></pre>

<p>In lambda …</p></div></div>

<div><p>A few people have asked recently what exactly is going on inside the PN junction. What concretely is happening? How can we leverage students’ previous knowledge about current and charge?</p><p>I made these videos because I wasn’t satisfied with the textbook or the available resources. No math; just a heuristic blow-by-blow focusing on electrons, physical force, and causality. The production value ranges from amateur to terrible.
