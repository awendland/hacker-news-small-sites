<h2 id="the-current-state">The current state</h2>
<p>There is a lot of hype about what the global distributed ledger aka “Blockchain” can do for society.
A “trust machine” as some people call it, that will bring the power of finance, data sovereignty and inclusion to the people,
hence rendering centralized intermediaries like Visa, Barclays &amp; Facebook obsolete.</p>
<p>We shall achieve this by using a combination of robust, battle tested cryptography &amp; game theory.</p>
<p>While this vision is plausible, realising it is not a easy as it may seem.</p>
<p>The blockchain is not yet ready.</p>
<h2 id="the-core-barriers-to-main-stream-adoption">The core barriers to main stream adoption</h2>
<p>The blockchain, while being a new concept in decentralized distributed databases has also presented a very unique set of problems in computer science &amp; economics that have never been solved at the time of this writing.</p>
<p>Is this post, I will talk about the the 6 most important issues only with which if solved, shall we (blockchain enthusiasts) ever achieve our vision.</p>
<h3 id="1-scalability-issues">1. Scalability Issues</h3>
<p>The current bandwidth, i.e the data that can be transmitted through a blockchain with in a given time is simply too bounded for main stream adoption.</p>
<p>Ethereum for instance does a maximum of 13 transactions per second. Visa on the other hand can do 24,000 Transaction per second and peak over 40,000 transactions per second.</p>
<p>So as you can see, the blockchain is thousands of magnitudes unable to manage a global traffic of financial transactions.
This is what they call the “Scalability Problem”</p>
<p>Coming up with a solution to scalability the problems without tarnishing the original value propositions of a blockchain (immutability/security, decentralization &amp; censorship resistance) is not trivial. It has been nick named the <a href="https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/Sharding-FAQ#this-sounds-like-theres-some-kind-of-scalability-trilemma-at-play-what-is-this-trilemma-and-can-we-break-through-it">“scalability trilemma”</a> by Vitalik Buterine (Ethereum’s co-author).</p>
<h3 id="2-lack-of-intuitive-private-key-management">2. Lack of Intuitive Private Key Management</h3>
<p>Ordinary users will simply never wrap their heads around private keys.</p>
<p>Private keys, which are a string of text used to sign transactions and make other proofs(cryptographic).</p>
<p>The purpose for these proofs or signatures is for other entities on a blockchain network to verify identities &amp; messages amongst themselves without reasonable doubt.</p>
<p>Private keys have two main problems first, how to store them securely.<br>
Anyone who can memorize, take a picture, or copy your private key can literally steal all your money.
Because they have your private key, they can make the cryptographic proofs/signatures and <em>accurately prove to everyone on the network they are you</em> even without your consent. Even when they are not you.</p>
<p>Second, you loose your key you loose access to all your money &amp; <em>no one can ever help you out</em>.
There is no “click here to remember your private key”</p>
<p>We need to first come up with something as intuitive using ATM/Debit cards.</p>
<p>Imagine if your bank told you that, “if you forgot your Debit card PIN, you loose access to all your money with <em>zero hope of recovering it how ever large a sum of money it would be</em>”.</p>
<p>If the above was the case, I don’t think any one would use debit cards.</p>
<h3 id="3-contract-security">3. Contract security</h3>
<p>It is simply not reliable &amp; safe for responsible institutions &amp; individuals to deploy smart contracts on blockchains like Ethereum.</p>
<p>Due to the blockchain having an immutable and unpredictable state, Smart contracts deployed on such a platform are also expected to suffer from immutable bugs &amp; unpredictable events.</p>
<p>As a result, millions of dollars have been lost in events such as the <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2017-the-ether-thief/">theft of $50 million from TheDAO</a> and <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/startup-lost-160-million-still-wants-shake-ethereum/"> Parity’s $160 Million loss of funds</a></p>
<p>I was glad that Rick dudley <a href="https://youtu.be/1AGHAuWz_4U?t=986">talked about this</a></p>
<h3 id="4-consensus-algorithms-are-wack">4. Consensus algorithms are wack</h3>
<p>The popular blockchains only don’t offer transaction finality i.e you will never be 100% sure that you have gotten funds.</p>
<p>You can only be <a href="https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/questions/319/what-number-of-confirmations-is-considered-secure-in-ethereum">probabilistically to a high degree</a> (but with zero guarantee) that you have received your funds.
This is because in major consensus algorithm called Nakamoto Consensus, the miners elect the chain with the most computational work that are with in the same protocol i.e consensus rules.</p>
<p>For instance imagine your bank tells you that you that, “there is a 95% chance that we <em>might</em> have your life savings, however you may also not poses it in 5 years in case we discovered that the chain with the most work does not have your transaction in it”</p>
<p>Yes, I don’t think anyone wants to keep their life savings in such a bank.</p>
<h3 id="5-privacy">5. Privacy</h3>
<p>Just by knowing someone’s cryptocurrency address, you can know their account balance &amp; transaction history simply by pasting it in a blockchain explorer like <a href="https://blockchain.info/">blockchain</a> and <a href="https://etherscan.io/">etherscan</a></p>
<p>Meaning it’s very easy for anyone to keep track of your financial activities without permission.</p>
<p>You buy HIV drugs? I now know your HIV positive, Your paying schools fees? now your local kidnapper knows where your kids study.</p>
<p>Buying birth control pills? Now anyone in the world may accurately guess that your a woman.
No careful person wants that!</p>
<h3 id="6-price-volatility">6. Price volatility</h3>
<p>Very few people simply don’t have the stomach to hold a financial instrument that drops by over 50% with in <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2017/12/26/bitcoin-price-in-2018-could-hit-60000-but-another-crash-is-coming.html">a few months</a>.</p>
<h2 id="what-can-we-do">What can we do?</h2>
<p>Most projects are building on platforms that have these problems regardless, in hopes that they will integrate solutions to the respective issues in the future.</p>
<p>The risk they face however, is that the platform they built on, my become obsolete after a heavy investment of time &amp; resources on the wrong platform.</p>
<p>Think how the <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/bitcoin-now-useless-micropayments-solutions-are-coming1/">micro payments industry died in bitcoin because of high fees</a></p>
<p>It’s like building your phone app around a windows smart-phone only to be made irrelevant because the next generation of mobile users will not be using windows smart-phones, but iOS and Android.</p>

<p>As the pandemic runs its course, tracking genetic mutations has gained mainstream coverage. Officially, in the line of work we call bioinformatics, finding and understanding mutations is known as <em>Variant Calling</em>. In the same way every person is different from others (except twins), an individual virus can have variations in their genome; when a lot of these genetic variations accumulate between the virus we detected originally and what we find months later in a faraway town, we can say that we have a new <em>strain</em> of the virus. The Coronavirus which we’re now calling <em>SARS-CoV-2</em> was first detected in Wuhan中国, so the genetic sequencing data from here is used as the base reference genome, and we measure mutations for the virus detected everywhere else against this; a coronavirus genome from a few towns away might only have a couple letters of the genome different from the Wuhan data, while something that’s travelled to the other side of the world after being transmitted through many people, climates, and even treatments, might now have acquired many more genetic variants compared to the original data.</p>
<h4 id="fig-2-retrieving-raw-covid-data-from-sra--creating-alignment-maps">Fig 2. Retrieving raw COVID data from SRA &amp; creating alignment maps</h4>
<p><img src="https://mokasquarl.github.io/images/render1612723995528-min.gif" alt="samtools tview" title="SARS-CoV-2 Aligned">
Data from viruses sequenced all across the world are uploaded into one of several databases (Table 1), this data is generated directly from machines by Illumina, Oxford Nanopore, or Life Technologies. When turning the molecules in genetic code into digital files these machines create strings that can be a few hundred letters in length to several thousand, but never the entire genome of the virus in a single string. A standardized file format called <em>fastq</em> holds all the strings from a single sample, including some quality data from the machine doing the sequencing. These strings are in no particular order, and first need to be mapped together to get the complete genome. Pretty much the standard way to create these genetic maps uses a technique invented in Palo Alto back in the early 90s by &nbsp;Michael Burrows and David Wheeler. The <em>Burrows–Wheeler Transform</em> was mostly just used in data compression, until around 2010 when computational biologists began to use it to align genomes together.</p>

<h4 id="table-1">Table 1.</h4>
<p><strong>SRA:</strong> <em>Sequence Read Archive</em> <strong>-Open Access</strong></p>

<p><strong>ENA:</strong> <em>European Nucleotide Archive</em> <strong>-Open Access</strong></p>

<p><strong>GISAID:</strong> <em>Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data</em> <strong>-Private</strong></p>

<p>Heng Li, now a professor at Harvard (amongst other things) has created the most commonly used alignment algorithm (amongst other things) with <a href="https://github.com/lh3/bwa">BWA</a>. This algorithm is super easy to use, and will get us results that are more than good enough.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>git clone https://github.com/lh3/bwa.git
cd bwa
make
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>BWA takes <strong>fastq</strong> files containing samples, along with a <em>fasta</em> file containing a reference genome to map the strings contained in our <strong>fastq</strong> file. Reference genomes are usually put out by the scientific wing of a National Government, Regional Organizations, and some Universities. We’ll get our Wuhan Coronavirus Reference genome from the <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/1798174254">National Center for Biotechnology Information</a> hosted by the US Federal government. A good sample to run against the Wuhan reference is the Washington state outbreak that happened early in the US, the <em>fastq</em> data for this is also hosted by the NCBI at their <a href="https://trace.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Traces/sra/?run=SRR11278092">Sequence Read Archive</a>. In the animated terminal above (Fig 2.) we see the commands needed to create our mapped genome from our input files, including retrieving the data from the databases . If you’d like to skip all that, we’re hosting both the reference genome, and the completed alignment map over at <a href="https://lucidalign.com/#cov">Lucid Align</a>. We’ll be using the <strong>bam</strong> file to detect our mutations, and we can also browse the genome of this Washington state outbreak sample using any sequence alignment viewer.</p>

<h4 id="fig-3-detecting-mutations-with-neural-network">Fig 3. Detecting Mutations with Neural Network</h4>
<p>
  <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/v5z5OV6UAVM" width="700" height="480" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="">
  </iframe>
</p>

<p>But before going on to variant calling this first sample let’s just prepare another sample while we’re making these alignment maps. Let’s do a more recent outbreak, from Kent, UK; which is far from Wuhan &amp; the Washington sample, in both time &amp; space. Retrieving the samples from the European Nucleotide Archive can be done from this <a href="https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/ERR4659819">link</a> or from the shell.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>git clone https://github.com/enasequence/enaBrowserTools.git
cd python3
enaDataGet.py -f fastq -m -d [output_directory] ERR4659819
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Creating the mapped genome from the Kent, UK outbreak is done the exact same way as with the Washington state outbreak, and now both files can be browsed directly with an alignment viewer. More importantly now we can run the <em>variant detection</em> and see all the mutations in each of these samples compared to the original Wuhan reference genome. Variant callers are an area of hot development for folks working on bioinformatics algorithms &amp; tools. Traditionally, Bayesian methods have been most reliable, but are hard-coded for specific organisms or need the settings dialed-in to get the correct sensitivity to specificity. This is so that we don’t get too many false-positives, while at the same time don’t miss any real mutations. In the last couple of years deep convolutional neural networks have really made a splash in variant calling, where now images are created almost similar to those we see from alignment viewers, and those images are used to train, and then have the neural network make the call on whether there is a mutation in a given section of the alignment map as we make our way down the entire map.</p>

<p><img src="https://mokasquarl.github.io/images/eff_kent.png" alt="Annotated VCF" title="High Impact mutation in Kent UK sample"></p>
<h4 id="fig-4-annotated-mutations-of-kent-uk-strain-b117">Fig 4. Annotated Mutations of Kent UK Strain B.1.1.7</h4>

<p>Bayesian variant callers are fairly simple to install, whereas the DCNN callers will need, in our case, Nvidia cuda drivers, and of course a machine with those GPUs. You could use <a href="https://magnolia.sh/">Magnolia</a> Fig 3., the super-cool neural network based caller that Leo van Driel helped write B-), but for this post we are going to use the built-in caller that comes with <a href="http://www.htslib.org/download/"><em>samtools</em></a> written by the previously mentioned Heng Li.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>bcftools mpileup -Ou -f &lt;ref.fasta&gt; &lt;sample1.bam&gt; | bcftools call -vmO z -o &lt;study.vcf.gz&gt;
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>After running any variant caller, we’re left with a <em>vcf</em> file, which is just a list of positions in a genome where the sample has a mutation compared to the reference, it might be good to just look at the file <a href="https://samtools.github.io/hts-specs/VCFv4.2.pdf">format specifications</a> to understand how these <em>vcf</em> files will be used moving forward. We can use the allotted fields in the <em>vcf</em> format to annotate, that is give meaning &amp; context to each of the mutations we detect in the genome. For this sample we’ve used <a href="https://pcingola.github.io/SnpEff/users_of_snpeff/">SnpEff</a> which makes life super easy by boiling all of the predicted effects of each of the mutations we detected into 3 simple categories, high impact, low, and moderate.</p>

<p>We can see in Fig 4. that running a standard Bayesian variant caller we detected a total of 48 mutations in the Kent UK sample. However, there might be some false-positives in there, it’s always better to be a bit more sensitive than to miss things. Let’s focus on the high impact mutations, things that will change the 3D structure of coronavirus. Looks like we only have 3 of those, all highlighted in red (Fig 4.), at genomic positions, 11288, 27972, and 28270. The VCF file we generated also contains data on which amino acids within the protein structure were changed to what, we can use that information to make the changes in our molecular structure, which in this case we’ve done with a current tool under development.</p>
<h4 id="fig-5-molecular-structure-editor">Fig 5. Molecular Structure Editor</h4>
<p><img src="https://mokasquarl.github.io/images/dalton_beta.gif" alt="Dalton PDB" title="Editing Molecular Structure"></p>

<p>Mutations which change the molecular structure are super important because that is more likely to make things behave differently, this can mean it attaches to human receptors more tightly, interacts with antibodies and drugs differently, because remember at the core of how molecules behave is the old mantra <strong>“form equals function.</strong>”</p>

                        you'll open a VS Code window into the running instance at the users <b>/app</b> home directory.
                        To start with a clean folder free of clutter, you can run <b>code src</b> to open a new VS Code window
                        into the empty <b>src</b> folder.
                    </p>

                    <h4>Start from your languages "Hello World"</h4>

                    <p>
                        To quickly get started playing with each language use the built-in
                        <a href="https://docs.servicestack.net/dotnet-tool">x tool</a>
                        to download any GitHub repo.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        To make it easy, <a href="https://github.com/gistcafe">gistcafe</a>
                        has a <em>hello-*</em> repo for each language that supports running a single source file <em>"Hello World"</em>
                        which you can browse with:
                    </p>

                    <h3>Run it!</h3>

                    <pre><label>x download gistcafe | grep hello-</label><b></b><i title="copy" onclick="copy(this)"></i></pre>

                    <p>
                        Then download the language you want, e.g you can download &amp; run a <a href="https://deno.land/">Deno</a> "Hello World" App with:
                    </p>

                    <pre><label>x download gistcafe/hello-deno &amp;&amp; cd hello-deno</label><b></b><i title="copy" onclick="copy(this)"></i></pre>
                    <pre><label>deno run hello.ts</label><b></b><i title="copy" onclick="copy(this)"></i></pre>

                    <h4>Start from a language project template</h4>

                    <p>
                        For installing all other non-single file (i.e. <em>hello-*</em>) repos you'll instead want to use <b>x new</b> so it applies all

                        Once you're ready to share your new App with the world you can publish it to a GitHub Gist by generating a
                        <a href="https://github.com/settings/tokens/new">GitHub Access Token</a> with <b>gist</b> scope
                        and adding it to your <em>GITHUB_TOKEN</em> Environment Variable:

          <p>Hello everyone,</p>
<p>I made <a href="https://github.com/whitphx/streamlit-webrtc" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">streamlit-webrtc</a>, which sends and receives video (and audio, but it’s only partially supported now) streams between frontend and backend via WebRTC.<br>
This should be helpful for creating, for example, performant real-time computer vision WebApps.</p>
<p>This week I tried Steamlit, found it interesting and useful, and then wanted to run real-time computer vision apps on Streamlit, on which users can try some computer vision models with video input from their webcams.<br>
So I tried to develop a component to achieve it using WebRTC. Fortunately, there is a great WebRTC library for Python, <a href="https://github.com/aiortc/aiortc" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">aiortc</a>.</p>
<p>One interesting thing about this component is that the input video streams are sourced from users’ webcams and transferred to the server-side Python process via the network. Therefore, the server does not need the access to the camera, unlike the usual approach using OpenCV (<code>cv2.VideoCapture</code>). It means the Python code can be hosted on a remote server (actually, I hosted a sample app on Heroku and it worked, as stated below).</p>
<p>In addition, WebRTC provides good performance with sending and receiving video/audio frames.</p>
<p>Here is a demo movie:<br>
</p><div><a href="https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/business7/uploads/streamlit/original/2X/a/af111a7393c77cb69d7712ac8e71ca862feaeb24.gif" data-download-href="/uploads/short-url/oYIcsMqSqHFlA92m5f3NdANeujO.gif?dl=1" title="streamlit-webrtc-demo-short1" rel="noopener nofollow ugc"><img src="https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/business7/uploads/streamlit/original/2X/a/af111a7393c77cb69d7712ac8e71ca862feaeb24.gif" alt="streamlit-webrtc-demo-short1" data-base62-sha1="oYIcsMqSqHFlA92m5f3NdANeujO" width="549" height="500" data-small-upload="https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/business7/uploads/streamlit/optimized/2X/a/af111a7393c77cb69d7712ac8e71ca862feaeb24_2_10x10.png"></a></div><p>
(A full version is hosted on <a href="https://youtu.be/BRrtN80ITfU" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">YouTube</a>)</p>
<p>You can see</p>
<ul>
<li>The app consumes, processes, and renders video frames in real time.</li>
<li>Streamlit’s interactive controls are still working well in combination with the code using WebRTC. For example, the threshold for object detection is changed interactively during execution.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can try out the sample app using the following commands.</p>
<pre><code>$ pip install streamlit-webrtc opencv-python
$ streamlit run https://raw.githubusercontent.com/whitphx/streamlit-webrtc-example/main/app.py
</code></pre>
<p>I also deployed it to Heroku, <a href="https://streamlit-webrtc-example.herokuapp.com/" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">https://streamlit-webrtc-example.herokuapp.com/</a> and confirmed it worked; however, it’s running on a very small instance on a free plan, and may not work well if multiple users access it at the same time.<br>
I recommend you to run it on your own environment.</p>
<p>It’s still a prototype and the API is not finalized, and the documentation has not been written. Please refer to <a href="https://github.com/whitphx/streamlit-webrtc/blob/master/app.py" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">the sample code</a> when you use the component.</p>
<p>I welcome any feedback!</p>

        <div itemprop="articleBody">
          <p>Technical note:</p>
<p>One technical challenge was to combine WebRTC and real-time processing with Streamlit’s execution model. This problem has already been stated in <a href="https://discuss.streamlit.io/t/access-webcam-video-from-a-hosted-streamlit-application/1301">Access Webcam Video from a hosted Streamlit application</a>.<br>
In case of <code>streamlit-webrtc</code> , additionally, <a href="https://github.com/aiortc/aiortc" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">aiortc</a> does not work in normal Streamlit scripts, which are executed from top to bottom and terminated at each user interaction (more fundamentally, it’s because of WebRTC’s async nature).</p>
<p>This library approaches this problem by creating threads independent of Streamlit execution.<br>
When the component is used for the first time, it forks a thread, launches <code>aiortc</code>’s code on an event loop in the thread, and maintains the thread over all the script executions until the WebRTC session is closed.</p>
<p>As a result of this approach, developers should alter their programming style when using this library, from Streamlit’s declarative way to an event-and-callback-based one. <a href="https://github.com/whitphx/streamlit-webrtc/blob/477416da84e77d76201d97269589fe5ff5d17d37/app.py#L293-L303" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">streamlit-webrtc/app.py at 477416da84e77d76201d97269589fe5ff5d17d37 · whitphx/streamlit-webrtc · GitHub</a> is an example. In this code, the computer vision part resides in a callback function, which is called from the forked thread triggered by the media stream regardless of Streamlit’s execution timing.</p>
<p>To bridge this forked execution of WebRTC and normal Streamlit’s controls, <code>streamlit-webrtc</code> exposes a <code>context</code> object, which is an interface to the objects running in the WebRTC’s async world.<br>
By using it, values from Streamlit’s controls can be passed to the computer vision code running in the forked thread, like <a href="https://github.com/whitphx/streamlit-webrtc/blob/477416da84e77d76201d97269589fe5ff5d17d37/app.py#L305-L317" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">streamlit-webrtc/app.py at 477416da84e77d76201d97269589fe5ff5d17d37 · whitphx/streamlit-webrtc · GitHub</a>.</p>

<p>I think it’s because you are using python &lt;3.8 <s>though <code>streamlit-webrtc</code> currently supports only &gt;=3.8.<br>
Please try with python 3.8.</s></p>
<p><s>I will also fix the package to be compatible with older versions of Python.</s></p>
<p>EDIT: I updated the package to be compatible with Python 3.6 and 3.7. Please try again.</p>

          <p>I got an invitation to Streamlit Sharing then deployed the sample app there: <a href="https://share.streamlit.io/whitphx/streamlit-webrtc-example/main/app.py" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">https://share.streamlit.io/whitphx/streamlit-webrtc-example/main/app.py</a><br>
but it didn’t work with a “permission denied” error when the app requires capturing video or audio from user’s device.</p>
<p>It means many interesting applications of this component, including real-time object detection and image transformation, cannot be used on Streamlit Sharing…<br>
The only page of the sample app that works is the third one, where the app plays video and audio files on server-side and transmit them to the client.</p>
<p>This is because, on Streamlit Sharing, the app is running inside iframe.<br>
<code>getUserMedia</code>, which is used to get access to user’s device, requires Feature Policy when called inside iframe.<br>

		<p>The issue of gender disparities within the fields of Science, Technology,&nbsp;Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) is one that’s kept academics and feminists&nbsp;alike busy for centuries.</p>
<p>Since the emergence of such disciplines over the course of the 18th century,&nbsp;women have typically lagged behind their male counterparts in terms of&nbsp;representation; and considerable discourse has been sparked (as well as many&nbsp;the heated debate) so as to figure out <em>why.&nbsp;</em></p>

<h2><strong>The Gender-Equality Paradox in STEM&nbsp;</strong></h2>
<p>It’s certainly an interesting phenomenon to consider — the concept that more&nbsp;progressive countries wherein you’d expect to find&nbsp;greater&nbsp;equality&nbsp;and thus an equal, if not larger, number of women working in STEM, the&nbsp;opposite is, in fact, occurring.</p>
<p>This was what was proposed by Gijsbert&nbsp;Stoet and David C. Geary, authors&nbsp;of the controversial 2018 study <a href="http://eprints.leedsbeckett.ac.uk/id/eprint/4753/6/symplectic-version.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">“The Gender-Equality Paradox in Science, Technology, Engineering, and&nbsp;Mathematics Education”;</a>&nbsp;controversial because upon attempts by Harvard researchers to recreate the&nbsp;results produced by this study, they came up short.</p>
<p><span>In response, Stoet and Geary clarified in a </span><a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0956797620904134">reply to said researchers at Harvard, published February 2020</a><span>&nbsp;that “men are more likely than women to enter STEM careers because of&nbsp;endogenous interest”, marking a shift from their original&nbsp;hypothesis.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>It begs the question: Is it simply a matter of interest? That women, because&nbsp;of their more nurturing and caring tendencies, opt for occupations&nbsp;characterised by providing aid (a notable example being nursing, a primarily&nbsp;female-dominated profession worldwide), whereas men, <a href="http://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/47af/4a7e87267aba681fb6971590ec80effce0c3.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">who express stronger inclinations towards working with things rather than&nbsp;people</a>, dominate careers within the fields of mathematics and engineering?</p>
<p>Or is it indeed deep-rooted in inequality and gender discrimination? Do women&nbsp;exhibit lower levels of interest in STEM degrees not simply because of innate&nbsp;predispositions, but because they are discouraged, either actively or&nbsp;subliminally, from pursuing them at a young age?</p>
<p><span>This is, arguably, where much of the debate stems from. And perhaps there&nbsp;is no right or wrong answer. Nevertheless, open discussions and constructive&nbsp;conversations with those holding differing perspectives can only serve to&nbsp;help advance existing knowledge on the issue.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h2><strong>So Why the Underrepresentation?&nbsp;</strong></h2>
<p>According to&nbsp;<a href="https://unesdoc.unesco.org/ark:/48223/pf0000253479">this text</a>&nbsp;published by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural&nbsp;Organisation (UNESCO), “discrimination, biases, social norms and expectations&nbsp;that influence the quality of education women receive and the subjects they&nbsp;study” are reasons cited as to blame for gender disparity in STEM.</p>
<p>However, some may argue that it’s not patriarchal barriers keeping women out&nbsp;of STEM as the above work by UNESCO might suggest, but rather the biological&nbsp;reality that women are hard-wired differently to men, and vice versa.</p>
<p>It’s not a concept unfamiliar to many — the psychological and behavioural&nbsp;differences between men and women has long been an area that’s generated&nbsp;substantial interest in popular culture.&nbsp;You might have even heard the&nbsp;saying “Men Are from Mars, Women Are from Venus”. This metaphor, coined by the&nbsp;eponymously titled book, was authored by American relationship counsellor John&nbsp;Gray, and has sold millions worldwide.</p>
<p>Although the views expressed within it are now widely considered to be&nbsp;outdated (having been&nbsp;originally published in 1992), in essence, one of&nbsp;the central points Gray highlights is this — that women tend to think&nbsp;emotionally, whilst men tend to think logically.</p>
<p>Though many may decry this notion (as well as the book altogether),&nbsp;criticising it for stereotyping human psychology, some may also consider it&nbsp;naïve to believe men and women are truly wired the same — that there do,&nbsp;indeed, exist inherent and fundamental differences in the psychology of the&nbsp;sexes.</p>
<p>And it’s this belief that lends itself to the explanation of why certain&nbsp;professions are predominantly female, whilst others remain predominately male.</p>
<p>Yet, it could be considered <em>just</em> as naïve to believe we live in an&nbsp;ideal world where the barriers that, for <em>centuries</em>, held women back&nbsp;from achieving equality have been completely eliminated.&nbsp;Society has&nbsp;certainly come a long way in advancing women’s rights and shedding&nbsp;stereotypical notions of gender roles, but to act like women no longer&nbsp;experience discrimination of any kind on the basis of their gender, even in&nbsp;our modern-day 21st century, may be a dire mistake.</p>
<h2><strong>The Wider Gender Gap Context</strong></h2>
<p>According to the Global Gender Gap Report, annually published by the World&nbsp;Economic Forum, the Global Gender Gap Index (GGGI) is one that measures gender&nbsp;equality through&nbsp;“benchmark[ing] national gender gaps on economic,&nbsp;education, health and political criteria”.</p>
<p>The most recent&nbsp;<a href="http://www3.weforum.org/docs/WEF_GGGR_2020.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2020 edition of the report</a>&nbsp;ranked Malaysia as 104th amongst 153 countries overall, and 86th within the&nbsp;subindex of Educational Attainment — one of four subindexes, with the other&nbsp;three being Economic Participation, Health and Survival and Political&nbsp;Empowerment.</p>
<p>Despite what may seem like average rankings for Malaysia, you might be pleased&nbsp;to know that though the computer industry is one typically dominated by men,&nbsp;this isn’t the case in Malaysia, where women comprise over 50% of employees&nbsp;within the field. Additionally, as of 2011, women held 49% of research&nbsp;positions in the sciences, technologies and innovations; a pretty much 50/50&nbsp;split.</p>
<h2><strong>What’s Being Done About It?</strong></h2>
<p>There exists a plethora of resources and workshops hosted by organisations,&nbsp;both globally and within Malaysia, dedicated to inspiring young women to&nbsp;pursue their passions within STEM industries.</p>
<p>One such example is&nbsp;<a href="https://women-in-tech.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Women in Tech,</a> a global movement with members spanning across 100+ countries, whose&nbsp;objectives revolve around the empowerment of women with the confidence and&nbsp;skills needed to excel in STEM fields.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A while ago, I’ve been working on a very large codebase that consisted of a few million lines of code.
Large systems are usually a big mess and this one was no exception.
Since this is a rather common problem in software engineering, I thought the internet would be
littered with stories about this topic.
There is a lot of talk about software carpentry, while software maintenance is rarely debated.
Either large programs are being maintained by dark matter developers or
nobody thinks that writing stories about large systems are interesting enough.</p><p>In the past I’ve encountered a few of those large monsters and they seem to have a lot in common.
This article will try to present some of the problems and tricks that I am using when
I have to deal with them. Hopefully this will inspire others to write similar posts
and share tips from their own bag of tricks.</p><h2 id="large-codebase-problems">Large codebase problems</h2><p>The main problem of any large codebase is the extreme complexity that stems from the fact
that we live in a messy world of details that are very hard to describe and put into words.
The programming languages that we are using nowadays are still too primitive for that task,
and it takes a lot of lines and various layers of abstractions before we are able to convey the
rules of our world to the all mighty computer [1].</p><p>The following sections will present some of the common problems which I’ve discovered during my
big system adventures.</p><p>A common trait of a large codebases is that at some point they become so large and bloated
that one person alone is no longer capable of understanding all its pieces. It seems to
me that after 100’000 lines of code, the maintenance related problems start to appear
as the complexity of the code simply dwarfs the capabilities of the human brain.
Such large systems are commonly maintained by more than one person, but with a large
group of people also come large organizational problems.</p><p>Within a large group of people the number of possible communication paths between them go bananas
and so it often happens that the ass no longer knows what the head is doing.
This misunderstanding in turn cause them to build the wrong thing that doesn’t fit
into the rest of the system. You might also know this situation under the term of
“those people had no idea what they were doing, and we will do it right this time” which is
quite often floating around in the latest maintenance team.</p><p>That rarely happens though, because it’s likely the Towel of Babel situation all over again.</p><h3 id="loss-of-knowledge">Loss of knowledge</h3><p>Large systems are usually maintained by the ones who did not build them. Initial
developers often leave the company or move up in the pecking order to
work on other projects and are therefore no longer familiar with the system.
Sometimes the bright minds outsourced the initial development of the project
in the name of lowering the costs, just to pay tenfold in the later stages once they realize
the outsourcers developed the wrong thing. Even worse is the fact that the in house developers
didn’t gain the internal domain knowledge that is necessary for further maintenance of the system.</p><p>This presents a big problem for the new maintainers, as they can’t just go
around the company and ask the original developers about the initial design decisions.
Learning this tribal knowledge usually takes a lot of time, because the code is harder to read and
understand than it is to write. These days most developers seem to switch jobs every 2 to 3 years,
therefore the learning process has to be constantly going on, otherwise you might end up
with a large and expensive monster that nobody knows anything about [2].
For most of the past large projects on which I’ve been working on, the team has usually
changed by the end of the first version.</p><p>Rigorously documenting every step is not the cure for this problem, because at some point all that
junk will become outdated and nobody will have the time to spend a year just reading the
documentation and figuring out how the pieces fit together [3].</p><h3 id="lack-of-knowledge">Lack of knowledge</h3><p>Large systems become large, because they are usually trying to solve every problem under the sun.
Often the organization that is embarking on such journey does not have enough experienced
employees on board to actually pull it off. Some like to say that pressure makes diamonds,
but sometimes it also crushes the things that are under.</p><p>It’s fine to have less experienced people working on a large system as long as they have the elders
overseeing their work. In the world where senior titles are handed left and right,
that is often not the case and it’s how you end up with a very fragile system that is suitable for
a replacement as soon as it was built. Most of the larger projects that I was working on and
were considered successes, had the core parts of the system written by experienced
developers. A significant chunks were also built by greenhorns, but they were usually
guided and their blast radius was limited to the less complex parts of the system.</p><h3 id="the-astronauts">The astronauts</h3><p>Big projects tend to attract the data modelers and other cultists who like to
get in the way of getting shit done. These architecture astronauts will endlessly
discuss the finer points of their UML data models and multithreaded layers of abstraction,
that will one day allow them to be the heroes of their own story by writing some well
encapsulated and “SOLID” code.</p><blockquote><p>Why IBM sales reps don’t have children?</p><p>Because all they do is sit on the bed telling their spouses how great it’s going to be.</p></blockquote><p>Meanwhile, the for loopers have to fight this creeping metadata bureaucracy
madness on a daily basis. The tools handed down to them from the ivory tower usually don’t stand
the heat of the battle, but that doesn’t bother the modelers who will try to fix
the problems with more obfuscation patterns. It’s how you end with a homebrewed middleware monstrosity,
because the 100 existing ones out there are obviously not up to the task of powering our little CRUD app.</p><h3 id="documentation-problems">Documentation problems</h3><blockquote><p>I like to keep documentation separated from the code. Who am I?</p><p>A fool, with an out of sync document.</p></blockquote><p>The documentation of any large system is almost always outdated.
The code is usually changing faster due to the endless edge cases of the system
that were not being thought of early on. The discovered edge case problems are
usually fixed by bolting additional functionality right on the spot.
The average code change of such patch is usually quite small,
but a few tweaks here and there accumulate over time until the original design no
longer matches with the reality.</p><p>Tweaking the code is usually simple as most people are familiar with the process. You pull the
code from the version control, you make your tweaks and then you push it back.
On the other hand updating the documentation is way more convoluted and usually involves the
whole ceremony, because the term documentation is actually a spaghetti of Word documents,
pdfs, spreadsheets, emails, wiki pages and some text files on some dude’s hard drive.</p><p>The corporate world still loves to use MS Word for writing technical documents, even though
it’s entirely unusable for this use case. The Word doesn’t support syntax highlighting for
code snippets and you get to play the game of “moving one image for 5 pixels to the
left will mess with your headings and right align all text.”
It also makes it very hard to have multiple people collaborating on the same document.
The version control still treats Word documents in the same way as binary blobs,
which makes merging changes and fixing merge conflicts far harder than it should be.
I still remember how people collaborated by working each on their own copy of the
document and having a documentation officer merging all the copies together
manually to avoid any merge conflicts. Fun times.</p><p>If you are lucky, you might be writing documentation in plain text, but then you may have to
get familiar with all kinds of weird Lovecraftian toolchains that are relying on
all sorts of ancient operating system specifics in order to produce a nicer looking document.</p><p>After all these years of progress, writing documentation is still an unpleasant process
due to all the pain surrounding the tools that we have to deal with on a daily basis.
Large projects ensure that not only is the documentation hard to write, it’s also
impossible to find and read due to the sheer number of documents [4].</p><h2 id="tackling-the-beast">Tackling the beast</h2><p>In this section I will describe my ways of tackling the problems of an unknown large codebase
that I often encounter in the wild.
As mentioned before, the main problem of large systems is that nobody can understand them
entirely and often you will be left wondering how the damn thing even works.</p><p>When you are trying to understand a specific part of a large system, it’s worth
taking the time to talk to the current maintainers. They usually know it well enough
to guide you through the jungle, so you can avoid the traps and get up to speed faster.
Sometimes you will encounter a situation where you will just have to figure it
out on your own, because nobody will have the answers to your questions.</p><p>Hopefully the following sections might give you some ideas on how to tackle such
situations.</p><h3 id="read-the-documentation">Read the documentation</h3><p>The easiest way to get familiar with a large system, is by going through its documentation and
actually reading it. Large systems usually contain
large swaths of outdated documentation, but even a slightly outdated document is
often better than not having it at all. Ask the elders about the current state of documentation,
so you don’t completely waste your time with deciphering the irrelevant documents.</p><p>Either way, the documentation will only give you an overview of the system. The details
behind design decisions are almost never mentioned and you will have to find another way.</p><h3 id="check-the-tests">Check the tests</h3><p>When I am trying to decipher how a specific part of the system is supposed to behave,
I usually check for tests. If they exist, you might want to scroll through them and hopefully
you will get another …</p></div></div>

I saw someone on a programming stream yesterday claim that they prefer raw c because it feels more <em>intuitive</em>. To me, this just seems out of touch with reality. Lets look at the simplest REPL, from <a href="https://cstack.github.io/db_tutorial/parts/part1.html">part 1</a> of the cstack database from scratch series. I think by the end anyone would agree with me that the c++ version of this code is better in every way to its c counterpart.</p><p>What we are creating here, REPL for short, is a very common introductory tool for someone just getting used to working with a SQL database. It allows a beginner user to interact with the database line by line, discovering how SQL works through tinkering with the language. Many of these REPL shells are also used in scripting languages, and its the default mode that python starts in if you pass it no arguments.</p><p>In this part, we are just looking at the simplest REPL ever, which just prompts the user with some context in the terminal, and allows lines of input to be evaluated. The only command we are evaluating for now is just the SQL .exit metacommand. Any other commands passed to our program are unrecognized. Here is the c version:</p><div><div><pre><code><span>#include &lt;stdbool.h&gt;

    <p>I’m sure you’ve come across the age-old, opinion-based debate of ‘Tabs vs. Spaces’ for <em>indentation</em> before. It has been going since forever, and there seem to be valid reasons for both sides:</p>
<p><strong>Tabs…</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>smaller files because it’s just 1 character</li>
<li>that’s what they’re used for</li>
<li>you can customize your own indentation width (👈 keep this one in mind)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Spaces…</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>to avoid problems in whitespace-sensitive environments</li>
<li>because you know what you’ll get, and consistency is key</li>
</ul>
<p>But, there’s more to this than just personal preferences. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/ChaseMoskal">u/ChaseMoskal</a> recently posted a very insightful and eye-opening post on Reddit with the title <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/javascript/comments/c8drjo/nobody_talks_about_the_real_reason_to_use_tabs/">“Nobody talks about the real reason to use Tabs over Spaces”</a>.</p>
<h2 id="the-one-real-reason-to-use-tabs-over-spaces">The one real reason to use tabs over spaces</h2>
<p>In his post, Chase explains his own experience of using spaces at his workplace, and the negative effects it had on co-workers with visual impairment.</p>
<p>One of his co-workers uses a tab-width of <code>1</code>, to avoid huge indentations when using a large font-size.</p>
<p>Another co-worked of his is using a tab-width of <code>8</code> because that works best for his situation with a wide monitor.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I see people saying “tabs lets us customize our tab-width”, as though we do this “for fun” — Chase</p>
</blockquote>
<p>By using tabs in our projects, we allow these kinds of customizations that are <em>essential</em> for people with visual impairment. Custom tab-widths might seem like an unnecessary thing to most, but some people rely on it—and we <em>can not</em> ignore that.</p>
<h2 id="accessible-first">Accessible first</h2>
<p>We simply can’t “convert” everyone to one side or the other, there’s no question about it. Everyone has their own preferences, and we should celebrate that freedom—that we have the ability to make our own choices.</p>
<p>But with that said, we should also make sure to include <em>everyone</em>, and that means respecting and using accessible tools like the Tab-character.</p>
<p>Much like designing for ‘mobile first’—making sure everyone, no matter what device, has a great experience with your product—we should create an ‘<strong>accessible first</strong>’ environment, by making sure that everyone has the same ability to work, whether it’s at the workplace or on an open-source project.</p>
<p>I thought Chase put it perfectly when he said in his post that <em>"…there’s just no counter-argument that even comes close to outweighing the accessibility needs of valued coworkers”</em>.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion--accessible-first-personal-preference-second">Conclusion — Accessible first, personal preference second</h2>
<p>By defaulting to tabs, we make sure that everyone has a great experience working together with others, no matter their own abilities.</p>
<p>And if you prefer spaces, feel free to use an auto-formatting tool that converts tabs to spaces when opening a file (all modern editors have these). Just make sure that the spaces get converted back to tabs before anyone else has to work on your code.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Only by making sure everyone has the same capability can we maximize our combined potential ❤️</p>
</blockquote>

Some of the best address specific barriers that need consideration. Others consider various perspectives that can get in our way. And still others provide an excellent roadmap for achieving success through real practical tools and activities. If you want this year to be your best, you may consider investing in some of these enlightening books. While several are worthwhile, the following five self-help books can help you achieve your goals and should definitely be on your reading list.</p><figure><img width="212" height="313" src="https://wimgo.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/project-bold-life.jpg" data-src="https://wimgo.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/project-bold-life.jpg" alt="" data-srcset="https://wimgo.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/project-bold-life.jpg 212w, https://wimgo.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/project-bold-life-203x300.jpg 203w" data-sizes="(max-width: 212px) 100vw, 212px" srcset="https://wimgo.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/project-bold-life.jpg 212w, https://wimgo.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/project-bold-life-203x300.jpg 203w"></figure><p><strong>Project Bold Life – The Proven Formula to Take on Challenges and Achieve Happiness and Success by Edward M. Kopko</strong></p><p>There are goals, and there are Bold Goals. Bold Goals are those that stretch us to our limits and allow us to overcome some of the most profound challenges. In doing so, we enjoy the pursuit of the Boldest Life possible, regardless of our specific situation. This is the perspective that Ed Kopko shares in his inspirational and critically acclaimed book, PROJECT BOLD LIFE (<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Project-Bold-Life-Challenges-Happiness-ebook/dp/B08DX38H7B">which is available on Kindle</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Project-Bold-Life-Challenges-Happiness/dp/1735334901">in paperback on Amazon</a>). Hands down, this is certainly one of the best engaging self-help books for those who want to be their best. <a href="https://www.projectboldlife.com/achievement/setting-life-goals/">Kopko breaks down the vital steps that go into creating goals</a>. (Hint: It’s not as easy as you think.) He also provides specific worksheets, formulas, and planners to help anyone in the process. As Kopko points out, many of us have faith in our abilities but we never truly act courageously on this faith.

Grover</strong></p><p>What does it take to go from being just good to being the best? What characteristics do those people who are considered to be among the best–superior athletes, successful businessmen, and more–share that make them great? Author Tim. S. Grover takes a relative view when it comes to self-help, bringing others into the self-improvement equation and using their traits as a guide. But ultimately, his premise is that you can’t count on anyone else to give you motivation–it must come from within. It is filled with great stories about athletes he has trained. For that, plus its direct and honest approach, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Relentless-Unstoppable-Tim-S-Grover-ebook/dp/B008O4TY3I">Relentless: From Good to Great to Unstoppable</a> is an essential read for anyone looking to make the most of themselves.</p><figure><img width="211" height="314" src="https://wimgo.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/big-magic.jpg" data-src="https://wimgo.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/big-magic.jpg" alt="" data-srcset="https://wimgo.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/big-magic.jpg 211w, https://wimgo.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/big-magic-202x300.jpg 202w" data-sizes="(max-width: 211px) 100vw, 211px" srcset="https://wimgo.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/big-magic.jpg 211w, https://wimgo.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/big-magic-202x300.jpg 202w"></figure><p><strong><em>Big Magic – Creative Living Beyond Fear</em> by Elizabeth Gilbert</strong></p><p>For many of us, our largest goals involve a creative pursuit. Some involve writing a novel or painting a self-portrait. Others might include acting on Broadway or performing live in a band. All these creative pursuits, however, are very personal in nature, and we may resist pursuing such goals. Fortunately, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Big-Magic-Creative-Living-Beyond/dp/1594634726">Elizabeth Gilbert tackles this subject in a unique way</a> and encourages us to be curious, fearless and loving. Gilbert’s approach is to embrace our creative side with both a sense of wonder and pragmatism. Sources of inspiration and creative ideas are everywhere, and all we need to do is recognize this. As one of the best self-help books for achieving creative goals, <em>Big Magic</em> is a great read.</p><figure><img width="182" height="296" src="https://wimgo.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/you-badass.jpg" data-src="https://wimgo.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/you-badass.jpg" alt=""></figure><p><strong><em>You Are a Badass – How to Stop Doubting Your Greatness and Start Living an Awesome Life</em> by Jen Sincero</strong></p><p>There are many books on positivity that you might include on your reading list for 2021. But <a href="https://www.amazon.com/You-Are-Badass%C2%AE-Doubting-Greatness/dp/0762447699">Jen Sincero takes a no-nonsense approach to self-care while infusing both humor and practicality in her book</a>. In essence, her message is one of self-understanding, self-love, and an awareness that growth and change are essential. With these acknowledgements and pursuits, anyone can be a “badass” and achieve their goals. Sincero also stresses the importance of being positive in one’s attitude and inviting a sense of courageousness.</p><figure><img width="208" height="313" src="https://wimgo.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/daring-greatly.jpg" data-src="https://wimgo.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/daring-greatly.jpg" alt="" data-srcset="https://wimgo.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/daring-greatly.jpg 208w, https://wimgo.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/daring-greatly-199x300.jpg 199w" data-sizes="(max-width: 208px) 100vw, 208px" srcset="https://wimgo.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/daring-greatly.jpg 208w, https://wimgo.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/daring-greatly-199x300.jpg 199w"></figure><p><strong><em>Daring Greatly – How the Courage to Be Vulnerable Transforms the Way We Live, Love, Parent and Lead</em> by Dr. Brenè Brown</strong></p><p>Brenè Brown has participated in over 12 years in research involving vulnerability, courage, shame and empathy. Few books tackle such topics well, which is why <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Daring-Greatly-Courage-Vulnerable-Transforms/dp/1592408419">Daring Greatly is one of the best self-help books to know</a>. Brown demonstrates how dealing with past embarrassments and feelings of shame can be liberating. She has achieved great success with her work and her lecture Brene Brown: The Call to Courage debuted on Netflix in 2019. Not only can this book boost one’s affected self-esteem and self-worth, but it can also help individuals move on courageously in a truthful and bold way. Ultimately, this helps us achieve our goals in life and enjoy much deeper connections with others.</p></div></div></div></div></div></div>]]>

    <h2>htmx 1.2.0 Release</h2>
<p>I'm happy to announce the <a href="https://unpkg.com/browse/htmx.org@1.2.0/">1.2.0 release</a> of htmx.</p>
<h3>New Features &amp; Major Changes</h3>
<ul>
<li><code>hx-vars</code> has been deprecated in favor of <code>hx-vals</code></li>
<li><code>hx-vals</code> now supports a <code>javascript:</code> prefix to achieve the behavior that <code>hx-vars</code> provided</li>
<li>The new <code>hx-headers</code> attribute allows you to add headers to a request via an attribute.  Like <code>hx-vals</code> it supports
JSON or javascript via the <code>javascript:</code> prefix</li>
<li><code>hx-include</code> will now include all inputs under an element, even if that element is not a form tag</li>
<li>The <a href="https://htmx.org/extensions/preload/">preload extension</a> now offers a <code>preload-images="true"</code> attribute that will aggressively load images in preloaded content</li>
<li>On requests driven by a history cache miss, the new <code>HX-History-Restore-Request</code> header is included so that the server
can differentiate between history requests and normal requests</li>
</ul>
<h3>Improvements &amp; Bug fixes</h3>
<ul>
<li>Improved handling of precedence of input values to favor the enclosing form (see <a href="https://github.com/bigskysoftware/htmx/commit/a10e43d619dc340aa324d37772c06a69a2f47ec9">here</a>)</li>
<li>Moved event filtering logic <em>after</em> <code>preventDefault</code> so filtering still allows events to be properly handled</li>
<li>No longer trigger after swap events on elements that have been removed via an <code>outerHTML</code> swap</li>
<li>Properly remove event handlers added to other elements when an element is removed from the DOM</li>
<li>Handle the <code>scroll:</code> modifier in <code>hx-swap</code> properly when an <code>outerHTML</code> swap occurs</li>
<li>Lots of docs fixes</li>
</ul>

        <p><span>M</span>any marine biologists identify a gateway drug into their obsession, and for Heather Koldewey, it was the seahorse. Who can blame her? Seahorses seem to have evolved not entirely in the ocean, but also by way of a whimsical storybook, in which animal body parts are all mixed up. A fish with the head of a horse? A male that gets pregnant, gives birth, and is monogamous?</p>

<p>Seahorses led her not only to her career as the head of marine and freshwater conservation at the London Zoological Society, but to her efforts as an activist as well. Shortly after getting her Ph.D., Koldewey co-founded <a href="https://www.projectseahorse.org/" target="_blank">Project Seahorse</a> to protect her study subject and the ocean habitats they live in.</p>
<p>Today, Koldewey amplifies both her science and her on-the-ground protection efforts in visionary and critical ways. She was instrumental in getting the Indian Oceanâ€™s Chagos Archipelago designated as a Marine Protected Area, which has helped degraded ecosystems revive and led to cross-disciplinary scientific breakthroughs. She helped forge the pioneering partnership <a href="https://net-works.com/" target="_blank">Net-works</a>, which supports local communities in the Philippines by helping them transform abandoned fishing nets into carpeting. Koldewey is helping make biodiversity protection a profitable business—and saving species as she goes.</p>

<p><strong>How did seahorses get you into conservation?</strong></p>
<p>I did my Ph.D. research in genetics. The whole field of molecular genetics was just starting to reveal you could identify different populations of species and where they came from by genetic markers. Amanda Vincent and I realized we could use genetics to combat the global market in seahorse trade. [More than 37 million seahorses a year are marketed for traditional medicinal use, aquariums, and souvenirs, and as a result they are threatened with extinction.] We could trace where the seahorses came from and target protection efforts to those areas. Amanda and I started Project Seahorse together, using this charismatic species to tackle big ocean issues. Sheâ€™s become the director as Iâ€™ve concentrated on other things. I stay involved and care deeply about that work.</p>
<p><strong>What did molecular genetics tell you about seahorses?</strong></p>
<p>Seahorses are rubbish at swimming, and they have home ranges. They are very immobile. You would expect that they would be highly structured, meaning that in a particular place you would find a particular species. It turns out thatâ€™s not usually the case. Even when seahorses are morphologically distinct (and donâ€™t look alike), they turn out to be closely related. Yet they are found in so many places around the globe. How can that be? They hitch a ride on whateverâ€™s passing by and move vast distances.</p>
<blockquote>When biologists and physicists&nbsp;get to put their heads together, we learn new things.</blockquote>
<p><strong>Seahorses are equally ubiquitous and threatened.</strong></p>
<p>I have a quest for solutions in the science. How do you solve problems seahorses are facing? One approach is captive breeding programs in zoos to address the aquarium trade, and there has been major progress. But of course seahorses and all the species with which they coexist have to be protected where they live. Over-harvesting of fish and incredibly destructive bottom-trawling are decimating the oceans. Industrial fishing is a huge problem. Another is the relentless pressure on coastal communities that depend on fishing for survival.</p>
<p><strong>You were instrumental in helping secure the Chagos Archipelago in the Indian Ocean as one of the largest Marine Protected Areas (MPA) in the world. How can limiting human impacts on such a remote place benefit ocean health?</strong></p>
<p>Getting protection in the Indian Ocean is hard won and challenging. Some areas are so over-harvested they are ocean deserts. In 2009, a group of organizations, including mine, compiled the scientific evidence to help support protection around this archipelago, which is part of the British Indian Ocean Territory. In 2010, the Bertarelli Foundation, which has helped protect more than 2 million kilometers of marine areas over the past 20 years, helped the British government to establish what was then the worldâ€™s largest no-take MPA.</p>
<p>The Chagos Archipelago is made up of 58 tiny islands and contains the largest coral atoll on Earth. Here marine life is abundant and diverse, representing a glimpse of what our oceans should look like. Although still affected, protected areas show resilience to climate change. We have research dating back 50 years that gives us valuable insights from this unique location.</p>
<p><strong>This work is about protection, but it has also yielded new insights into how the ocean functions. How?</strong></p>
<p>Weâ€™ve known for a relatively long time that MPAs benefit reef-dwelling species, but havenâ€™t had as much information about how they influence the world of the ocean around them—migratory species, for example, and pelagic (open ocean) species. We have more than 70 scientists from disciplines including physics, genetics, and biology all working in this one place, which has yielded fantastic new insights. For example, a manta scientist watching mantas feeding noticed that they suddenly seemed to disappear. He couldnâ€™t figure it out. What made them suddenly move? The physicist who was monitoring the underwater currents at the time was able to say, â€œoh, itâ€™s the internal waves switching; takes their food right away.â€�</p>
<p>The amazing thing is that biologists and physicists donâ€™t often get to put their heads together, but when they do, we learn new things.</p>
<blockquote>Ocean health is key to supporting human life.</blockquote>
<p><strong>What about the islands themselves, the terrestrial ecosystems?</strong></p>
<p>Weâ€™ve also learned quite a lot in the Chagos Archipelago about how the terrestrial health of the islands impacts the water. Some islands are invaded with rats, which decimate native species and decrease overall biomass. Rats eat eggs and chicks. The islands that donâ€™t have rats support more seabirds. There is a more robust nutrient flow between the water and the land, thanks to the seabirds, increasing the fish biomass off these healthy islands. These islands also seem to be more resilient to coral bleaching events.</p>
<p><strong>Everything is connected. Including people and wildlife.</strong></p>
<p>That idea is at the foundation of Net-Works. As you know, plastic pollution in the oceans is a huge and growing crisis. In addition to plastic bottles everywhere, discarded fishing nets are a terrible issue. In local communities that depend on fishing for survival, the more depleted the fish in their waters, the more nets they use—and eventually abandon when they are beyond repair. Net-Works has set up a supply-chain in the Philippines in which local people are paid to collect discarded nets, bale them, and ship them out to be recycled into nylon threads that are subsequently woven into carpeting. Weâ€™ve collected enough nets thus far to wrap more than five times around the circumference of the globe. This project is not only helping to clean up the ocean, it is providing a revenue alternative to people who are unfairly exploited in the global fishing industry.</p>
<p>Net-Works has been so successful a project within the Zoological Society of London (where Heather works) that it has spun out into an independent social enterprise called <a href="https://coast4c.com/" target="_blank">Coast 4C</a>. 4C stands for â€œcommunity, commerce, conservation, climate,â€� because they are all interconnected. This model has diversified from nets to include seaweed farming in the Philippines. Carrageenan extracted from seaweed is used in products all over the world, but like so many other supply chains, this one has been unfair to local communities. Coast 4C is putting together a model in which the people who live on the water and farm the seaweed will benefit from the supply chain and increase marine protection.</p>
<p><strong>Sorry for this inevitable pun, but there seems to be a sea-change in conservation underway.</strong></p>
<p>Yes. Conservation has largely depended on foundation money, grants, and funds from the government. But these are not always sustainable over time. How can we finance conservation for the long term? We are starting to see more and more initiatives that facilitate social and impact investment into conservation. We are seeing new players in the world of conservation—corporate finance people, insurance executives. Itâ€™s not just biologists and shouldnâ€™t be—everyone can be a conservationist.</p>
<p><strong>In 2018 the United Nations reported 4.6 million fishing vessels in operation, harvesting two-thirds of fishing stocks to capacity and one-third at biologically unsustainable levels. Are you worried about ocean degradation?</strong></p>
<p>To say nothing of climate change, pollution, and acidification. Ocean health is key to supporting human life. For one thing, the ocean absorbs carbon dioxide and produces the air we breathe. More than 3 billion people rely directly on marine and coastal biodiversity to live.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>You look at the statistics, where we are headed, and itâ€™s scary, daunting. I focus on what I can do and form collaborations with very good people. Lots of people have part of the answer but not the whole thing. Together, we can build that jigsaw puzzle and make a difference.</p>

        <article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting">

  

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>This post is the second in a three-part series about
<a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/tree/main/cranelift">Cranelift</a>.
In the <a href="https://cfallin.org/blog/2020/09/18/cranelift-isel-1/">first post</a>, I
described the context around Cranelift and our project to replace its
backend code-generation infrastructure, and detailed the
instruction-selection problem and how we solve it. The remaining two
posts will be deep-dives into some interesting engineering problems.</p>

<p>In this post, I want to dive into the <em>compiler performance</em> aspect of
our work more deeply. (In the next post we’ll explore correctness.)
There are many interesting aspects of compilation speed I could talk
about, but one particularly difficult problem is the handling of
<em>control flow</em>: how do we translate structured control flow at the
Wasm level into control-flow graphs at the IR level, and finally to
branches in a linear stream of instructions at the machine-code level?</p>

<p>Doing this translation efficiently requires careful attention to the
overall pass structure, with the largest wins coming when one can
completely eliminate a category of work. We’ll see this in how we
combine several passes in a traditional lowering design (critical-edge
splitting, block ordering, redundant-block elimination, branch
relaxation, branch target resolution) into <em>inline transforms</em> that
happen during other passes (lowering of the CLIF, or Cranelift IR,
into machine-specific IR; and later, binary emission).</p>

<p>This post basically describes the
<a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/blob/main/cranelift/codegen/src/machinst/buffer.rs"><code>MachBuffer</code></a>,
a “smart machine-code buffer” that knows about branches and edits them
on-the-fly as we emit them, and the
<a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/blob/main/cranelift/codegen/src/machinst/blockorder.rs"><code>BlockLoweringOrder</code></a>,
which allows us to lower code in final basic-block order, with split
critical edges inserted implicitly, by traversing a never-materialized
implicit graph. The work was done mostly in <a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/1718">Cranelift PR
#1718</a>, which
resulted in a ~10% compile-time improvement and a ~25%
compile+run-time improvement on a CPU-intensive benchmark (<code>bz2</code>).</p>

<h2 id="control-flow-graphs">Control-Flow Graphs</h2>

<p>Before we discuss any of that, we need to review control-flow graphs
(CFGs)! The CFG is a fundamental data structure used in almost all
modern compilers. In brief, it represents how execution (i.e., program
control) may flow through instructions, using graph nodes to represent
linear sequences of instructions and graph edges to represent all
possible control-flow transfers at branch instructions.</p>

<p>At the end of the instruction selection process, which we learned
about in the <a href="https://cfallin.org/blog/2020/09/18/cranelift-isel-1/">previous post</a>, we have a function body lowered into VCode that consists of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_block"><em>basic blocks</em></a>. A basic
block is a contiguous sequence of instructions that has no outbound
branches except at the end, and has no inbound branches except at the
beginning. In other words, it is “straight-line” code: execution
always starts at the top and proceeds to the end. An example
control-flow graph (CFG) consisting of four basic blocks is shown
below:</p>

<p><img src="https://cfallin.org/assets/2020-10-08-cfg-web.svg" alt="Figure: Control-flow graph with four basic blocks in a diamond"></p>

<p>Control-flow graphs are excellent data structures for compilers to
use. By making the flow of execution explicit as graph edges, rather
than reasoning about instructions in order in memory as the processor
sees them, many analyses can be performed more easily. For example,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data-flow_analysis">dataflow analysis</a>
problems can be solved easily because the CFG makes traversal of
possible control-flow transfers easy. Graph-based representations of
the program also allow easier <em>moving and insertion of code</em>: it is
less error-prone to manipulate an explicit graph than to reason about
implicit control-flow (e.g. fallthrough from a not-taken conditional
branch). Finally, the graph representation factors out the question of
<em>block ordering</em>, which can be important for performance; we can
address this problem separately by choosing how we serialize the graph
nodes (blocks). For these reasons, most compiler IRs, including
Cranelift’s CLIF and <code>VCode</code>, are CFG-based.</p>

<p>(Historical note: control-flow graphs were invented by the late
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frances_Allen">Frances Allen</a>, who
largely established the algorithmic foundations that modern compilers
use. Her paper <a href="https://www.clear.rice.edu/comp512/Lectures/Papers/1971-allen-catalog.pdf">A catalogue of optimizing
transformations</a><sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>
covers essentially all of the important optimizations used today and
is well worth a read.)</p>

<h2 id="cpus-and-branch-instructions">CPUs and Branch Instructions</h2>

<p>To represent a CFG’s end-of-block branches at the instruction level,
we can use <em>two-way branches</em>: these are instructions that branch
either to one basic-block target if some condition is true, or another
if the condition is false. (Basic blocks can also end in simple
unconditional single-target branches.) We wrote such a branch as <code>if
r0, L1, L2</code> above; this means that the block <code>L0</code> will be followed in
execution either by <code>L1</code> or <code>L2</code>, depending on the value in <code>r0</code>.<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup></p>

<h3 id="branches-with-fallthrough">Branches with Fallthrough</h3>

<p>However, CPUs rarely have such two-way branch instructions. Instead,
conditional control-flow in common ISAs is almost always provided with
a <em>conditional branch with fallthrough</em>. This is an instruction that,
if some condition is true, branches to another location; otherwise,
does nothing, and allows execution to continue sequentially. This is a
better fit for a hardware implementation for a number of reasons: it’s
easier to encode one target than two (the destination of the jump
might be quite far away for some branches, and instructions have
limited bits available), and it’s usually the case that the compiler
can place one of the successor blocks immediately afterward anyway.</p>

<p>Now, this isn’t much of a problem if we just want a working compiler;
instead of a two-way branch</p>



<p>We can write a sequence of branches</p>



<p>where <code>br_if</code> branches to <code>L1</code> or falls through to the unconditional
<code>goto</code>. But this is not so efficient in many cases. Consider what
would happen if we laid out basic blocks in the order <code>L0</code>, <code>L2</code>,
<code>L1</code>, <code>L3</code>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>    L0:
      ...
      br_if r0, L1
      goto L2
    L2:
      ...
      goto L3
    L1:
      ...
      goto L3
    L3:
      ...
      return
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>There are two redundant unconditional branches (<code>goto</code> instructions),
each of which uselessly branches to the following instruction. We can
remove both of them with no ill effects, taking advantage instead of
<em>fallthrough</em>, or allowing execution to proceed directly from the end
of one block to the start of the next one:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>    L0:
      ...
      br_if r0, L1
      // ** Otherwise, fall through to L2 **
    L2:
      ...
      goto L3
    L1:
      ...
      // ** Always fall through to L3 **
    L3:
      ...
      return
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This seems like an easy enough problem to solve: we just need to
recognize when a branch is redundant and remove it, right? Well, yes,
but we can do much better than that in some cases; we’ll dig into this
problem in significantly more depth below!</p>

<h3 id="machine-code-encoding-branch-offsets">Machine-code Encoding: Branch Offsets</h3>

<p>So far, we’ve written our machine instructions in a way that humans
can read, using <em>labels</em> to refer to locations in the instruction
stream. At the hardware level, however, these labels do not exist;
instead, the machine code branches contain target <em>addresses</em> (usually
encoded as relative <em>offsets</em> from the branch instruction). In other
words, we do not see <code>goto L3</code>, but rather <code>goto +32</code>.</p>

<p>This gives rise to several complications when emitting machine code
from a list of instruction <code>struct</code>s.  At the most basic level, we
have to resolve labels to offsets and then patch the branches
appropriately. This is analogous to (but at a lower level than) the
job of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linker_(computing)">linker</a>:
we resolve symbols to concrete values after deciding placement, and
then edit the code according to <em>relocations</em> to refer to those
symbols. In other words, whenever we emit a branch, we make a note (a
relocation, or “label use” in our <code>MachBackend</code>) to go back later and
patch it with the resolved label offset.</p>

<p>The second, and more interesting, problem arises because not all
branch instructions can necessarily refer to all possible labels! As a
concrete example, on AArch64, conditional branches have a ±1 MB range,
and unconditional branches have a ±128 MB range. This arises out of
instruction-encoding considerations: particularly in
fixed-instruction-size ISAs (such as ARM, MIPS, and RISC V), less than
a full machine word of bits are available for the immediate jump
offset that is embedded in the instruction word. (The instruction
itself is always a machine-word wide, and we need some bits for the
opcode and condition code too!) On x86, we have limits for a different
reason: the variable-width encoding allows either a one-byte offset
(allowing a ±128 byte range) or four-byte offset (allowing a ±2 GB
range).</p>

<p>To make a branch to a far-off label, then, on some machines we need to
either use a different sort of branch than the default choice for the
instruction selector, or we need to use a form of <em>indirection</em>, by
targetting the original branch to <em>another branch</em>, the latter in a
special form. The former is tricky because we do not know whether a
target will be in-range until all code is lowered and placement is
computed; so we need to either optimistically or pessimistically lower
branches to the shortest or longest form (respectively) and possibly
switch later. To make matters worse, as we edit branches to use a
shorter or longer form, their length may change, moving <em>other</em>
targets into or out of range; in the most general solution, this is a
“fixpoint problem”, where we iterate until no more changes occur.</p>

<h2 id="challenges-in-lowering-cfgs-to-machine-code">Challenges in Lowering CFGs to Machine Code</h2>

<p>So far, we have a way to produce <em>correct</em> machine code. To emit the
final code for a two-target branch, we can emit a conditional-
followed by unconditional-branch machine instruction. To resolve
branch targets correctly, we can assume that any target could be
anywhere in memory, and always use the long form of a branch; then we
just need to come back in one final pass and fill in the offsets when
we know them.</p>

<p>We can do much better than this, though! Below I’ll describe four
problems and the ways that they are traditionally solved.</p>

blocks will appear in the final binary. In …</p></div></article></div></div></div>

<p>Hello! This article took a while to cobble together. If you find it useful, please consider leaving a donation via <a href="https://donorbox.org/crdt-article"> </a>, <a href="https://www.buymeacoffee.com/archagon"> </a>, or <a href="ethereum:0x0d5dd8a8Cca8Bf7d0122F7A1Cc76c6b0666fCC56"> </a>. (Thought I'd try something new!) Or, just buy yourself a nice Roost through my <a href="http://amzn.to/2D7uYxz"> </a>. Donation or not, thank you for reading! 😊</p>

<p>(Sorry about the length! At some point in the distant past, this was supposed to be a short blog post. If you like, you can skip straight to the <a href="#demo-concurrent-editing-in-macos-and-ios">demo section</a> to get a sense of what this article is about.)</p>

<p>Embarrassingly, most of my app development to date has been confined to local devices. Programmers like to gloat about the stupendous mental castles they build of their circuitous, multi-level architectures, but not me. In truth, networks leave me quite perplexed. I start thinking about data serializing to bits, servers performing their arcane handshakes and voting rituals, merge conflicts pushing into app-space and starting the whole process over again—and it all just turns to mush in my head. For peace of mind, my code needs to be <em>locally provable</em>, and this means things like idempotent functions, decoupled modules, contiguous data structures, immutable objects. Networks, unfortunately, throw a giant wrench in the works.</p>

<p>Sometime last year, after realizing that most of my document-based apps would probably need to support sync and collaboration in the future, I decided to finally take a stab at the problem. Granted, there were tons of frameworks that promised to do the hard work of data model replication for me, but I didn’t want to black-box the most important part of my code. My gut told me that there had to be some arcane bit of foundational knowledge that would allow me to sync my documents in a refined and functional way, decoupled from the stateful spaghetti of the underlying network layer. Instead of downloading a Github framework and <a href="http://amzn.to/2iigBOI">smacking the build button</a>, I wanted to develop a base set of skills that would allow me to easily network <em>any</em> document-based app in the future, even if I was starting from scratch.</p>

<!--more-->

<p>The first order of business was to devise a wishlist for my fantastical system:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Most obviously, users should be able to edit their documents immediately, without even touching the network. (In other words, the system should only require <em>optimistic concurrency</em>.)</li>
  <li>Sync should happen in the background, entirely separate from the main application code, and any remote changes should be seamlessly integrated in real-time. (The user shouldn’t have to notice that the network is down.)</li>
  <li>Merge should always be automatic, even for concurrent edits. The user should never be faced with a “pick the correct revision” dialog box.</li>
  <li>A user should be able to work on their document offline for an indefinite period of time without accruing “sync debt”. (Meaning that if, for example, sync is accomplished by sending out mutation events, performance should not suffer even if the user spends a month offline and then sends all their hundreds of changes at once.)</li>
  <li>Secondary data structures and state should be minimized. Most of the extra information required for sync should be stored in the same place as the document, and moving the document to a new device should not break sync. (No out-of-band metadata or caches!)</li>
  <li>Network back-and-forth should be condensed to a bare minimum, and rollbacks and re-syncs should practically never happen. To the greatest possible degree, network communication should be stateless and dumb.</li>
  <li>To top it all off, my chosen technique had to pass the “PhD Test”. That is to say, one shouldn’t need a PhD to understand and implement the chosen approach for custom data models!</li>
</ul>

<p>After mulling over my bullet points, it occurred to me that the network problems I was dealing with—background cloud sync, editing across multiple devices, real-time collaboration, offline support, and reconciliation of distant or conflicting revisions—were all pointing to the same question: was it possible to design a system where any two revisions of the same document could be merged deterministically and sensibly without requiring user intervention? Sync, per se, wasn’t the issue, since getting data from one device to another was essentially a solved problem. It’s what happened <em>after</em> sync that was troubling. On encountering a merge conflict, you’d be thrown into a busy conversation between the network, model, persistence, and UI layers just to get back into a consistent state. The data couldn’t be left alone to live its peaceful, functional life: every concurrent edit immediately became a cross-architectural matter. On the other hand, if two documents could always be made to merge, then most of that coordination hullabaloo could go out the window. Each part of the system could be made to work at its own pace.</p>

<p>Whether stored as a record in a database or as a stand-alone file, a document could be interpreted as a collection of basic data fields: registers, sequences, dictionaries, and so forth. Looking at the problem from a database perspective, it was actually quite simple to automatically resolve merge conflicts in this kind of table row: just keep overwriting each field with the version sporting the highest timestamp, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lamport_timestamps">logical</a> or otherwise. (Ignoring issues of inter-field consistency for now.) Of course, for anything other than basic registers, this was a terrible approach. Sequences and dictionaries weren’t just blobs of homogeneous data that were overwritten with every change, but complex, mutable structures that users were editing on a granular level. For such a fundamental problem, there was a surprising dearth of solutions out in the real world: most systems punted the task to app-space by asking the client to manually fix any merge conflicts or pick the correct version of a file. It seemed that if the problem of automatic merge for non-trivial data types could be solved—perhaps by exposing their local, type-specific mutation vocabulary to the storage and replication layers?—then a solution to the higher-level problem of automatic document merge would fall within reach.</p>

<p>In hope of uncovering some prior art, I started by looking at the proven leader in the field, Google Docs. Venturing down the deep rabbit hole of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collaborative_real-time_editor">real-time collaborative editing</a> techniques, I discovered that many of the problems I faced fell under the umbrella of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eventual_consistency">strong eventual consistency</a>. Unlike the more conventional <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strong_consistency">strong consistency</a> model, where all clients receive changes in identical order and rely on locking to some degree, strong <em>eventual</em> consistency allows clients to individually diverge and then arrive at a final, consistent result once each update has been received. (Or, in a word, when the network is <em>quiescent</em>.)</p>

<p>There were a number of tantalizing techniques to investigate, and I kept several questions in mind while doing my analysis. Could a given technique be generalized to arbitrary and novel data types? Did the technique pass the PhD Test? And was it possible to use the technique in an architecture with smart clients and dumb servers?</p>

<p>The reason for that last question was CloudKit Sharing, a framework introduced in iOS 10. For the most part, this framework functioned as a superset of regular CloudKit, requiring only minor code changes to enable document sharing in an app. A developer didn’t even have to worry about connecting users or dealing with UI: Apple did most of the hard work in the background while leveraging standard system dialogs. But almost two years later, <a href="https://github.com/search?l=Swift&amp;q=UICloudSharingController&amp;type=Code&amp;utf8=%E2%9C%93">on the order of no one</a> seemed to be using it. Why was this? Most other Apple APIs tended to be readily adopted, especially when they allowed the developer to expand into system areas which were normally out of bounds.</p>

<p>My hunch was that CloudKit Sharing forced the issue of real-time collaboration over a relatively dumb channel, which was a task outside the purview of conventional sync approaches. CloudKit allowed developers to easily store, retrieve, and listen for new data, but not much else besides. No third-party code was allowed to run on Apple’s servers, so merge conflicts had to be handled locally. But unlike in the single-user case, which presented limited opportunities for concurrent edits, you couldn’t just pop up a merge dialog every time another participant in your share made a change to your open document. The only remaining options seemed to be some sort of ugly, heuristic auto-merge or data-dropping last-write-wins, neither of which was acceptable for real-time use. Collaboration along the lines of Google Docs appeared to be impossible using this system! But was it really?</p>

<p>I realized that this was my prize to be won. If I could figure out a way to develop auto-merging documents, I’d be able to implement sync and collaboration in my apps over CloudKit while using Apple’s first-party sharing UI—all without having to pay for or manage my own servers. So this became my ultimate research goal: a collaborative iPhone text editing demo that synced entirely over CloudKit. (And here’s a spoiler: <a href="#demo-concurrent-editing-in-macos-and-ios">it worked!</a>)</p>





<p>There are a few basic terms critical to understanding eventual consistency. A network is comprised of <em>sites</em> (“devices”, “peers”) operating in parallel, each one producing <em>operations</em> (“events”, “actions”) that mutate the data and exchange information with other sites. The first vital concept here is <strong>causality</strong>. An operation is <em>caused</em> by another operation when it directly modifies or otherwise involves the results of that operation, and determining causality is critical to reconstructing a sensible timeline (or <strong>linearization</strong>) of operations across the network. (An operation that <em>causes</em> another operation must always be ordered first.) However, we can’t always determine direct causality in a general way, so algorithms often assume that an operation is causally ahead of another one if the site generating the newer operation has already seen the older one at the time of its creation. (In other words, every operation already seen by a site at the time a new operation is created is in that operation’s <em>caus…</em></p></article></div></div></div></div>

		<p>With the explosion of new content fuelled by the internet, for the majority of us, consumption reigns supreme. But I don't believe anybody really stops to think about why we consume the content we do and what that says about us and the content. I think generally content is interesting for one of two reasons</p><ol><li>The content itself</li><li>The creator of the content</li></ol><p>All content exists somewhere on the creator-content continuum (the Triple C).</p><p>To figure out where a piece of content fits it's helpful to define the edges. Amazingly enough Reality TV sits at both extremes of the Triple C.</p><p>The early forms of RTV sit at the pure content side. Think Survivor, Big Brother and The Real World. Literally, random people off the street put into absurd situations for the enjoyment of audiences at home. Do you know who the producers, writers were for those shows? Did anybody know who the contestants were on the show before they started? The only thing interesting about the shows was the misery and drama provided - at least before RTV 'stars' started becoming celebrities in their own right. Pure content.</p><p>The more modern forms of RTV are however pure creator. Think KUWTK and basic YouTube vloggers. Content that is only interesting to people because of who the creator is. Literally, famous people doing everyday things. Is it really that interesting watching someone talk into a camera about going shopping if you're not invested in who they are as a creator?</p><p>Okay, great. We've got the edges, but what about the holy grail. The middle where content and creator meet in a symbiotic mishmash of pure content awesomeness and creator obsession? That's what I call the Dave Chappelle Divide (previously known as the Beatle Bump). What's the DCD? The DCD is where content is interesting in equal parts because of the content itself and because of who the creator is. I could watch Dave Chappelle sitting, smoking a cigarette and ranting about the world for hours.<sup>1</sup> Is that because his routine is insanely interesting or is it because he’s Dave Chappelle? For me, both. I believe the content could stand on its own but coming from Dave Chappelle enhances its character. I call it the Content Creator Compound Effect.</p><p>Why is getting to the DCD and creating a CCCE important? Because there's this curious moment where the enjoyment and value one derives from content is actually enhanced by your investment in the creator. The example I would use here is Khan Academy. It started off on the pure content side of the Triple C. It stands on its own. It is highly informative and has been useful to millions of students around the world before anyone knew who Sal Khan was. As Sal has grown in fame and importance Khan Academy have tried having other people make videos but for some reason they don’t quite hit the same way. The same content with a different creator is not as good. In fact I would argue his increasing fame has made Khan Academy even more useful.<sup>2</sup> So does that mean we should find the best content we can, propel those creators to fame so that we are able to enjoy and derive even more value from their content? Maybe.</p><p>One interesting aspect of this continuum is that the better a creator is at creating content the more and more their future content can fall into the trap of being interesting only because of the creator themselves. Looking historically it appears incredibly hard to straddle the Dave Chappelle Divide. The issue here is fame seems to be a powerful drug. And once a creator reaches some threshold where no matter the quality of their content there is a base level of interest in it, often the content seems to suffer. Why is it that most bands' best work is their first album? Why do so many famous Mathematicians make the breakthrough that they're known for in their 20s? It is said that TV dulls the mind, perhaps fame is the true dullant.<sup>3</sup></p><p>Let's take a step back to explore other forms of content and try to place them on the Triple C to see what that says about that content, those creators, ourselves and how we should actually consume them.</p><p>Startup, financial and business advice often, I would argue, sits on the creator side of the Triple C. Most advice of this type suffers from some combination of generic platitude, survivorship bias or any of the other many smart sounding accusations thrown around on Hacker News. When we consume content that we are meant to learn from and apply in our own lives we really need to be wary of content that is interesting only because of its creator. Because if this content is meant to be informative but it is only interesting because of the creator then you're in trouble. How useful, really, is advice from Elon Musk? Most of us are not in his shoes, we don't have access to his connections and opportunity. When he was in our shoes some 25 years ago at this point the world was a much different place. But millions flock to listen to what he has to say. Of course the question is, is this even wrong? Why should the same content from Elon Musk not be more interesting and given more credence than if it were provided to us by an anonymous person on Reddit? You have to ask yourself, is this creator interesting because of previous content they’ve created<sup> 4</sup> in this field? Elon Musk probably doesn’t have that many interesting or worthwhile things to say about yodeling.<sup>5</sup> Even if the creator is within their sphere of competence you still need to evaluate the content for itself. If you don't, all the content is good for is entertainment. If it is just entertainment you’re seeking, that, is totally fine. I am a huge fan of entrepreneurship porn but you should be honest with yourself and not be tricked into thinking you're doing something productive. So what, are we supposed to ignore all startup advice? Well no, but you should stop to think a little more, is this within their sphere of competence? Is this only interesting because of the creator or is there some merit to the content? Well how am I supposed to know if there’s merit to the content, that’s the whole reason I’m seeking the content from this creator? Uhh 😬, good question. Let me get back to you on that one.</p><p>Clubhouse is interesting - watching rooms fluctuate in size when a well known person joins highlights the incredible power of the creator. Their mere presence increases how interesting the content in the room appears and often is. But, I've also been involved in the complete opposite rooms where nobody says anything interesting and I get to the end of the hour and realise I've listened to an hour of people introducing themselves and trying to sound important, get more followers without saying anything actually worth listening to. To be fair I don't blame them, making good content is hard and it also isn't enough, you need to promote it too, but it is hard not to feel a little cheated when you sit through the promotion but the worthwhile content never materialises.</p><p>So, where does this yarn sit? If you think this yarn is in any way interesting and you’re reading this in 2021 then it’s purely content based because nobody knows who I am. But if for some inexplicable reason I was to gain some form of notability and you are reading this in 2031 it could theoretically be true that this formation of words is only interesting to you because I’m the creator. The bizarre case of the wandering content.</p><p>I'm interested to hear where other people would place the content I've discussed and other forms of content on the Triple C. </p>

<p>
Navigating codebases of any meaningful size is difficult. Most of a programmer’s time is spent jumping through the codebase, reading or skimming to build a mental model of the constructs and conventions within it. These constructs — among them: the DSLs, interfaces, and taxonomy of types that exist — are arguably the most important precursor to understanding where and how to make changes. But these constructs only exist in programmers’ heads. It’s difficult or impossible to navigate most codebases through the lens of those constructs; programmers lack “code browsers” that present the underlying code independently of files and the filesystem hierarchy. Yet code browsers that can do so — and we’ll look at some examples below — would be incredibly useful. This is because instances of these constructs can be thought of as records in a database, albeit an ad-hoc, poorly-specified database that can only be queried through carefully-crafted regexes<a href="#fn:1" id="fnref:1" title="see footnote">1</a>.</p>
<p>
In simple cases, some constructs manifest as naming conventions: prefixes in a name may be a rudimentary way to namespace classes<a href="#fn:2" id="fnref:2" title="see footnote">2</a>, while suffixes may be a rudimentary way to group classes or identify their type<a href="#fn:3" id="fnref:3" title="see footnote">3</a>. But these are easy examples; many patterns are much more subtle.</p>
<h2>
“Where is this used?”</h2>
<p>
Imagine figuring out “where is this used?”, for various types of “this”:</p>
<p>
Most code editors (perhaps paired with a <a href="https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/">language server</a>) can show you where local variables are used. This usually also works for finding where methods are invoked — although perhaps less reliably in dynamic-dispatch languages, or languages without types.</p>
<p>
What if you want to find where instances of a particular model get created? There may be multiple ways to create a model, so this isn’t super simple. In Rails, for example, there’s two built-in ways to create a model: you can either call <code>.new</code> to create a new instance in memory followed by <code>.save</code> to persist it to the database, or call <code>.create</code> to automatically do both. Your particular codebase might have additional wrappers for doing this that you’re supposed to use. Even worse, imagine that sometimes you create a <code>.new</code> instance, then set some properties on it over the next few lines, then finally call <code>.save</code>. Something like this:</p>
<pre><code>user = User.new
user.email = '<a href="https://feifan.blog/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" data-cfemail="6e060b0202012e0b160f031e020b400d0103">[email&nbsp;protected]</a>' unless self.anonymous?
user.save</code></pre>
<p>
Conceptually, that’s still code that creates an instance of a particular model. But with the intervening syntax, this would be a difficult case to find with <code>grep</code>.</p>
<h2>
Static config</h2>
<p>
At <a href="https://stripe.com/">Stripe</a>, where I work, we have a lot of code for jobs that need to run at certain times each day. For example, we might need to move funds from one financial partner to another at noon UTC each day. Each of these jobs has configuration code describing when and how it should be run, implemented as a <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/mps/concepts/domain-specific-languages/">DSL</a>. This config might look something like this:</p>
<pre><code>run_config RunConfig.new(
  job_name: 'partner-daily-funding',
  env_vars: self.config_env,
  cron: RunConfig::Cron.new(
    schedule: { hour: 12, minute: 0 }
  ),
  owning_team: Company::Team::Liquidity
)</code></pre>
<p>
In our codebase, we have hundreds of these jobs, each with their own <code>run_config</code>. If you look at this codebase as a database, you can imagine these jobs being rows in a <code>jobs</code> table, where the fields on each row correspond to the parameters provided to the <code>RunConfig</code> class. </p>
<p>
Wouldn’t it be great to be able to browse all these jobs in a table? Maybe you could perform some basic operations on this data: searching for specific jobs by name or owning team; sorting by the time-of-day they’re scheduled to run; filtering for jobs owned by your team that have errored in the past week. Maybe you could edit the <code>run_config</code> from that interface (like you might edit a spreadsheet) and have it automatically make the corresponding change in the source code (or open a PR). Maybe you could even compute some aggregations on this data — for example, if you’re introducing a new job that requires some expensive computation, maybe you’d like to know which hours have the fewest other jobs scheduled. And of course, this job browser should be bidirectional with respect to the codebase — there should be a button beside each entry that shows the code for the job inline or opens the corresponding code in your editor.</p>
<h2>
Diffused concepts</h2>
<p>
Codebases typically contain logical concepts that are implemented across multiple pieces of code. This is often the case when you need to create multiple files to implement a particular feature.</p>
<p>
For example, in Rails, a “resource” is collectively implemented across a line in the router, a model file, a controller file, and a bunch of view files. Rails even ships with a code generator to <a href="https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/5f3ff60084ab5d5921ca3499814e4697f8350ee7/railties/lib/rails/generators/rails/resource/USAGE">create some of these files</a> for you. But despite resources being a core concept when working with Rails, there’s no good way to browse the resources in your codebase<a href="#fn:4" id="fnref:4" title="see footnote">4</a>. There’s no good way to filter or query your codebase either — you can’t, for example, see which resources support JSON vs XML params. </p>
<p>
For another example, consider pubsub (aka emitter-consumer) pipelines. In web services, when you have processing that can happen “in the background”, one service will publish an event; another service subscribes to that event and will do the background processing on its own when it receives the event. Often, these will form event “pipelines” or trees where an event consumer will emit additional events that are consumed by yet other services. These pipelines are concepts that developers talk about (as in, the “account creation pipeline” or “funding reconciliation pipeline”), but in most codebases the pipeline itself isn’t declared or reified anywhere in the code.</p>
<p>
If you’re looking at code that emits an event, how do you find the consumers? If you’re lucky, the event has a unique, literal name and the consumer uses that name literally as well. But maybe some subscribers are using wildcard event names, or names generated by string concatenation, and that becomes a lot harder to grep for. Likewise, if you’re looking at a consumer of an event, how do you find the locations in the codebase that could emit that event<a href="#fn:5" id="fnref:5" title="see footnote">5</a>?</p>
<p>
Wouldn’t it be great to be able to browse those pipelines in a table or perhaps a directed graph<a href="#fn:6" id="fnref:6" title="see footnote">6</a>? Maybe that graph would support some basic operations on this data: searching for specific publishers or subscribers by class name or event name; filtering for pipelines that have run into errors; maybe even showing the flow of a particular event given an event ID<a href="#fn:7" id="fnref:7" title="see footnote">7</a>. And of course, this pipeline browser should be bidirectional with respect to the codebase — there should be a button beside each graph node that shows the code for the publisher or subscriber inline or opens the corresponding code in your editor.</p>
<p>
For a final example, consider code that has functionality inherited from elsewhere. Some environments let you see a <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/viewing-structure-of-a-source-file.html">list of inherited properties</a> or methods, but this isn’t possible for more specialized cases. At Stripe, we have code that implements shell scripts that can take command-line arguments and flags. These arguments are defined via a DSL in the implementing code, but these commands can be subclassed, and there’s no way to see what the available arguments are while working in the subclass.</p>
<h2>
Philosophy</h2>
<p>
I think it’s important to consider these problems not as disparate cases in need of bespoke tooling, but as a <em>class</em> of problems characterized by a lack of access to the data structures embedded within codebases. Just like SQL databases and spreadsheets provide a singular querying abstraction and a set of visualization primitives that can be applied to any kind of data, programming environments need a singular querying abstraction and set of visualization primitives that can be applied to the concepts lurking in codebases. Getting there does <em>not</em> mean using proprietary drag-and-drop visual programming interfaces where the introspection capabilities are limited to whatever the programming environment happens to have implemented. Just the opposite — you should still be able to do whatever you want with your code (including treating it as plain-text files), <em>and also</em> have access to more advanced introspection tools that can query and slice your code — tools that let you easily understand and navigate complex codebases to reduce the <em>incidental complexity</em> of building software.</p>
<h2>
Solutions</h2>
<p>
I don’t have a solution to sell you here (at least, not yet!). But <a href="https://twitter.com/hirday_g/status/1356657607381946369">by popular demand</a> I think it’s worthwhile to at least discuss principles that solutions should embody and directionally-related prior art. </p>
<p>
To start with a simple example, see <a href="https://ihp.digitallyinduced.com/">IHP</a>, a full-stack web framework similar to Rails. It comes with a web interface for manipulating your project’s codebase and database schema. <a href="https://youtu.be/UbDtS_mUMpI?t=102">One point in the introduction video</a> showed changes being made in the visual schema editor being automatically reflected in the SQL code that describes the database schema — and changes being made to the SQL code being bidirectionally reflected in the visual schema editor. </p>
<p>
For a more in-depth example, consider <a href="https://pharo.org/">Pharo</a>, a Smalltalk environment. “Environment” in this case means that it feels like you’re using a custom OS (including global menus, idioms, and keyboard and mouse conventions) designed specifically for browsing, writing, and debugging programs in the Smalltalk programming language<a href="#fn:8" id="fnref:8" title="see footnote">8</a>. The holistic integration of these tools is important. Unlike the programming environments we cobble for ourselves today — where the editor is agnostic of the language and runtime and other tools like debuggers, inspectors, and code browsers are tacked on (if they exist at all) — it’s worth thinking about what an entire computing experience <em>for</em> writing and building custom tools might look like<a href="#fn:9" id="fnref:9" title="see footnote">9</a>.</p>
<p>
Pharo is also interesting because of its Class Browser, which looks like this:</p>
<p>
  <img src="https://files.tanagram.app/file/tanagram-data/prod-feifans-blog/database-codebase-pharo-browser.png" alt="Pharo class browser">
</p>
<p>
This browser breaks free from the source code <em>file</em> as the atomic unit of browsing; instead, it allows the user to browse one method at a time. Making the “unit of browsing” …</p></article></div></div></div>

<p>Biologically Plausible Deep Learning (BPDL) is an active research field at the intersection of Neuroscience and Machine Learning, studying how we can train deep neural networks with a "learning rule" that could conceivably be implemented in the brain.</p><p>The line of reasoning that typically motivates BPDL is as follows:</p><ol><li>A Deep Neural Network (DNN) can learn to&nbsp;perform perception tasks that biological brains are capable of (such as detecting and recognizing objects).</li><li>If activation units and their weights are to DNNs as&nbsp;what neurons and synapses are to biological brains, then what is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backpropagation">backprop </a>(the primary method for training deep neural nets) analogous to?</li><li>If learning rules in brains are not implemented using backprop, then how are they implemented? How can we achieve similar performance to backprop-based update rules while still respecting biological constraints?</li></ol><p>A nice overview of the ways in which backprop is not biologically plausible can be found <a href="https://psychology.stackexchange.com/questions/16269/is-back-prop-biologically-plausible">here</a>, along with various algorithms that propose fixes.</p><p>My somewhat contrarian opinion is that designing biologically plausible alternatives to backprop is the wrong question to be asking. The motivating premises of BPDL makes a faulty assumption: that <b>layer activations are neurons and weights are synapses, and therefore learning-via-backprop must have a counterpart or alternative in biological learning.</b></p><p>Despite the name and their impressive capabilities on various tasks, DNNs actually have very little to do with biological neural networks. One of the great errors in the field of Machine Learning is that we ascribe too much biological&nbsp; meaning to our statistical tools and optimal control algorithms. It leads to confusion from newcomers, who ascribe entirely different meaning to "learning", "evolutionary algorithms", and so on.</p><p>DNNs are a sequence of linear operations interspersed with nonlinear operations, applied sequentially to real-valued inputs - nothing more. They are optimized via gradient descent, and gradients are computed efficiently using a dynamic programming scheme known as backprop. Note that I didn't use the word "learning"!</p><p>Dynamic programming is the ninth wonder of the world<span>1</span>, and in my opinion one of the top three achievements of Computer Science. Backprop has linear time-complexity in network depth, which makes it extraordinarily hard to beat from a computational cost perspective. Many BPDL algorithms often don't do better than backprop, because they try to take an efficient optimization scheme and shoehorn in an update mechanism with additional constraints.&nbsp;</p><p>If the goal is to build a biologically plausible learning mechanism, there's no reason that units in Deep Neural Networks should be one-to-one with biological neurons. Trying to emulate a DNN with models of biologically neurons feels backwards; like trying to emulate the Windows OS with a human brain. It's hard and a human brain can't simulate Windows well.</p><p>Instead, let's do the emulation the other way around: optimizing a function approximator to&nbsp;implement a biologically plausible learning rule. The recipe is straightforward:</p><ol><li>Build a biological plausible model of a neural network with model neurons and synaptic connections. Neurons communicate with each other using spike trains, rate coding, or gradients, and respect whatever constraints you deem to be "sufficiently biologically plausible". It has parameters that need to be trained.</li><li>Use computer-aided search to design a biologically plausible learning rule for these model neurons. For instance, each neuron's feedforward behavior and local update rules can be modeled as a decision from an artificial neural network.</li><li>Update the function approximator so that the biological model produces the desired learning behavior. We could train the neural networks via backprop.&nbsp;</li></ol><p>The choice of function approximator we use to find our learning rule is irrelevant - what we care about at the end of the day is answering how a biological brain is able to learn hard tasks like perception, while respecting known constraints like the fact that biological neurons don't store all activations in memory or only employ local learning rules. We should leverage Deep Learning's ability to find good function approximators, and direct that towards finding a good biological learning rules.</p><p>The insight that we should&nbsp;<i>(artificially)&nbsp;learn to (biologically) learn</i>&nbsp;is not a new idea, but it is one that I think is not yet obvious to the neuroscience + AI community. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta_learning_(computer_science)">Meta-Learning</a>, or "Learning to Learn",&nbsp;is a field that has emerged in recent years, which formulates the act of acquiring a system capable of performing learning behavior (potentially superior to gradient descent). If meta-learning can find us more <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1703.05175.pdf">sample efficient</a> or <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.07392">superior</a>&nbsp;or <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1906.03367.pdf">robust</a>&nbsp;learners, why can't it find us rules that respect biological learning constraints? Indeed, recent work [<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.09549.pdf">1</a>, <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2019.12.30.891184v1.full.pdf">2</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.03837.pdf">3</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1608.05343">4</a>, <a href="http://proceedings.mlr.press/v119/real20a/real20a.pdf">5</a>] shows this to be the case. You can indeed use backprop to train a separate learning rule superior to naïve backprop.</p><p>I think the reason that many researchers have not really caught onto this idea (that we should emulate biologically plausible circuits with a meta-learning approach) is that until recently, compute power wasn't quite strong enough to both train a meta-learner and a learner. It still requires substantial computing power and research infrastructure to set up a meta-optimization scheme, but tools like <a href="https://blog.evjang.com/2019/02/maml-jax.html">JAX make it considerably easier now</a>.</p><p>A true biology purist might argue that finding a learning rule using gradient descent and backprop is not an "evolutionarily plausible learning rule", because evolution clearly lacks the ability to perform dynamic programming or even gradient computation. But this can be amended by making the meta-learner evolutionarily plausible. For instance, the mechanism with which we select good function approximators does not need rely on backprop at all. Alternatively, we could formulate a meta-meta problem whereby the selection process itself obeys rules of evolutionary selection, but the selection process is found using, once again, backprop.</p><p>Don't mess with backprop!</p><p><b>Footnotes</b></p><p>[1] The eighth wonder being, of course, <a href="https://www.listenmoneymatters.com/compound-interest/">compound interest</a>.</p>

<h2 id="tldr">TL;DR<a href="#tldr" aria-label="tldr permalink"></a></h2>
<p>In this article I’m trying to explain the difference/similarities between dynamic programing and divide and conquer approaches based on two examples: <a href="https://github.com/trekhleb/javascript-algorithms/tree/master/src/algorithms/search/binary-search">binary search</a> and <a href="https://github.com/trekhleb/javascript-algorithms/tree/master/src/algorithms/string/levenshtein-distance">minimum edit distance</a> (Levenshtein distance).</p>
<h2 id="the-problem">The Problem<a href="#the-problem" aria-label="the problem permalink"></a></h2>
<p>When I <a href="https://github.com/trekhleb/javascript-algorithms">started to learn algorithms</a> it was hard for me to understand the main idea of dynamic programming (<strong>DP</strong>) and how it is different from divide-and-conquer (<strong>DC</strong>) approach. When it gets to comparing those two paradigms usually Fibonacci function comes to the rescue as great <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/13538459/difference-between-divide-and-conquer-algo-and-dynamic-programming">example</a>. But when we’re trying to solve the <strong>same</strong> problem using both DP and DC approaches to explain each of them, it feels for me like we may <strong>lose valuable detail</strong> that might help to catch the difference faster. These detail tells us that each technique serves best for <strong>different</strong> types of problems.</p>
<p>I’m still in the process of understanding DP and DC difference, and I can’t say that I’ve fully grasped the concepts so far. But I hope this article will shed some extra light and help you to do another step of learning such valuable algorithm paradigms as dynamic programming and divide-and-conquer.</p>
<h2 id="dynamic-programming-and-divide-and-conquer-similarities">Dynamic Programming and Divide-and-Conquer Similarities<a href="#dynamic-programming-and-divide-and-conquer-similarities" aria-label="dynamic programming and divide and conquer similarities permalink"></a></h2>
<p>As I see it for now I can say that <strong>dynamic programming is an extension of the divide and conquer paradigm</strong>.</p>
<p>I would <strong>not</strong> treat them as something completely different. Because <strong>they both work by recursively breaking down a problem into two or more sub-problems</strong> of the same or related type, until these become simple enough to be solved directly. The solutions to the sub-problems are then combined to give a solution to the original problem.</p>
<p>So why do we still have different paradigm names then and why I called dynamic programming an extension. It is because dynamic programming approach may be applied to the problem <strong>only if the problem has certain restrictions or prerequisites</strong>. After that dynamic programming extends divide and conquer approach with <strong>memoization</strong> or <strong>tabulation</strong> technique.</p>
<p>Let’s go step by step...</p>
<h2 id="dynamic-programming-prerequisitesrestrictions">Dynamic Programming Prerequisites/Restrictions<a href="#dynamic-programming-prerequisitesrestrictions" aria-label="dynamic programming prerequisitesrestrictions permalink"></a></h2>
<p>As we’ve just discovered there are two key attributes that divide and conquer problem must have in order for dynamic programming to be applicable:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optimal_substructure">Optimal substructure</a> - optimal solution can be constructed from optimal solutions of its sub-problems</li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overlapping_subproblems">Overlapping sub-problems</a> - problem can be broken down into sub-problems which are reused several times, or a recursive algorithm for the problem solves the same sub-problem over and over rather than always generating new sub-problems</li>
</ul>
<p>Once these two conditions are met we can say that this divide and conquer problem may be solved using dynamic programming approach.</p>
<h2 id="dynamic-programming-extension-for-divide-and-conquer">Dynamic Programming Extension for Divide and Conquer<a href="#dynamic-programming-extension-for-divide-and-conquer" aria-label="dynamic programming extension for divide and conquer permalink"></a></h2>
<p>Dynamic programming approach extends divide and conquer approach with two techniques (<strong>memoization</strong> and <strong>tabulation</strong>) that both have a purpose of storing and re-using sub-problems solutions that may drastically improve performance. For example naive recursive implementation of Fibonacci function has time complexity of <code>O(2^n)</code> where DP solution doing the same with only <code>O(n)</code> time.</p>
<p><strong>Memoization (top-down cache filling)</strong> refers to the technique of caching and reusing previously computed results. The memoized <code>fib</code> function would thus look like this:</p>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>memFib(n) {
    if (mem[n] is undefined)
        if (n &lt; 2) result = n
        else result = memFib(n-2) + memFib(n-1)
        mem[n] = result
    return mem[n]
}</code></pre></div>
<p><strong>Tabulation (bottom-up cache filling)</strong> is similar but focuses on filling the entries of the cache. Computing the values in the cache is easiest done iteratively. The tabulation version of <code>fib</code> would look like this:</p>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>tabFib(n) {
    mem[0] = 0
    mem[1] = 1
    for i = 2...n
        mem[i] = mem[i-2] + mem[i-1]
    return mem[n]
}</code></pre></div>
<p>You may read more about memoization and tabulation comparison <a href="https://programming.guide/dynamic-programming-vs-memoization-vs-tabulation.html">here</a>.</p>
<p>The main idea you should grasp here is that because our divide and conquer problem has overlapping sub-problems the caching of sub-problem solutions becomes possible and thus memoization/tabulation step up onto the scene.</p>

<p>Since we’re now familiar with DP prerequisites and its methodologies we’re ready to put all that was mentioned above into one picture.</p>

<p>Let’s go and try to solve some problems using DP and DC approaches to make this illustration more clear.</p>
<h2 id="divide-and-conquer-example-binary-search">Divide and Conquer Example: Binary Search<a href="#divide-and-conquer-example-binary-search" aria-label="divide and conquer example binary search permalink"></a></h2>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_search_algorithm">Binary search</a> algorithm, also known as half-interval search, is a search algorithm that finds the position of a target value within a sorted array. Binary search compares the target value to the middle element of the array; if they are unequal, the half in which the target cannot lie is eliminated and the search continues on the remaining half until the target value is found. If the search ends with the remaining half being empty, the target is not in the array.</p>

<p>You may clearly see here a divide and conquer principle of solving the problem. We’re iteratively breaking the original array into sub-arrays and trying to find required element in there.</p>
<p>Can we apply dynamic programming to it? <strong>No</strong>. It is because <strong>there are no overlapping sub-problems</strong>. Every time we split the array into completely independent parts. And according to divide and conquer prerequisites/restrictions the sub-problems <strong>must be</strong> overlapped somehow.</p>
<p>Normally every time you draw a decision tree and it is actually a <strong>tree</strong> (and <strong>not</strong> a decision <strong>graph</strong>) it would mean that you don’t have overlapping sub-problems and this is not dynamic programming problem.</p>

<h2 id="dynamic-programming-example-minimum-edit-distance">Dynamic Programming Example: Minimum Edit Distance<a href="#dynamic-programming-example-minimum-edit-distance" aria-label="dynamic programming example minimum edit distance permalink"></a></h2>
<p>Normally when it comes to dynamic programming examples the <a href="https://github.com/trekhleb/javascript-algorithms/tree/master/src/algorithms/math/fibonacci">Fibonacci</a> number algorithm is being taken by default. But let’s take a little bit more complex algorithm to have some kind of variety that should help us to grasp the concept.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levenshtein_distance">Minimum Edit Distance</a> (or Levenshtein Distance) is a string metric for measuring the difference between two sequences. Informally, the Levenshtein distance between two words is the minimum number of single-character edits (<em>insertions, deletions or substitutions</em>) required to change one word into the other.</p>
<h3 id="example-1">Example<a href="#example-1" aria-label="example 1 permalink"></a></h3>
<p>For example, the Levenshtein distance between “kitten” and “sitting” is 3, since the following three edits change one into the other, and there is no way to do it with fewer than three edits:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>k</strong>itten → <strong>s</strong>itten (substitution of “s” for “k”)</li>
<li>sitt<strong>e</strong>n → sitt<strong>i</strong>n (substitution of “i” for “e”)</li>
<li>sittin → sittin<strong>g</strong> (insertion of “g” at the end).</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="applications">Applications<a href="#applications" aria-label="applications permalink"></a></h3>
<p>This has a wide range of applications, for instance, spell checkers, correction systems for optical character recognition, fuzzy string searching, and software to assist natural language translation based on translation memory.</p>
<h3 id="mathematical-definition">Mathematical Definition<a href="#mathematical-definition" aria-label="mathematical definition permalink"></a></h3>
<p>Mathematically, the Levenshtein distance between two strings <code>a</code>, <code>b</code> (of length <code>|a|</code> and <code>|b|</code> respectively) is given by function <code>lev(|a|, |b|)</code> where:</p>
<p><span>
      <span></span>

    </span></p>
<p>Note that the first element in the minimum corresponds to <strong>deletion</strong> (from <code>a</code> to <code>b</code>), the second to <strong>insertion</strong> and the third to <strong>match or mismatch</strong>, depending on whether the respective symbols are the same.</p>
<h3 id="explanation">Explanation<a href="#explanation" aria-label="explanation permalink"></a></h3>
<p>Ok, let’s try to figure out what that formula is talking about. Let’s take a simple example of finding minimum edit distance between strings <strong>ME</strong> and <strong>MY</strong>. Intuitively you already know that minimum edit distance here is <strong>1</strong> operation and this operation is *“replace <strong>E</strong> with <strong>Y</strong>”*. But let’s try to formalize it in a form of the algorithm in order to be able to do more complex examples like transforming <strong>Saturday</strong> into <strong>Sunday</strong>.</p>
<p>To apply the formula to M<strong>E</strong>→M<strong>Y</strong> transformation we need to know minimum edit distances of ME→M, M→MY and M→M transformations in prior. Then we will need to pick the minimum one and add +1 operation to transform last letters E→Y.</p>
<p>So we can already see here a recursive nature of the solution: minimum edit distance of ME→MY transformation is being calculated based on three previously possible transformations. Thus we may say that this is <strong>divide and conquer algorithm</strong>.</p>
<p>To explain this further let’s draw the following matrix.</p>
<p><span>

<ul>
<li><strong>Cell (0,1)</strong> contains red number 1. It means that we need 1 operation to transform <strong>M</strong> to <strong>empty string</strong>: delete <strong>M</strong>. This is why this number is red.</li>
<li><strong>Cell (0,2)</strong> contains red number 2. It means that we need 2 operations to transform <strong>ME</strong> to <strong>empty string</strong>: delete <strong>E</strong>, delete <strong>M</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Cell (1,0)</strong> contains green number 1. It means that we need 1 operation to transform empty string to <strong>M</strong>: insert <strong>M</strong>. This is why this number is green.</li>
<li><strong>Cell (2,0)</strong> contains green number 2. It means that we need 2 operations to transform empty string to <strong>MY</strong>: insert <strong>Y</strong>, insert <strong>M</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Cell (1,1)</strong> contains number 0. It means that it costs nothing to transform <strong>M</strong> to <strong>M</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Cell (1,2)</strong> contains red number 1. It means that we need 1 operation to transform <strong>ME</strong> to <strong>M</strong>: delete <strong>E</strong>.</li>
<li>And so on...</li>
</ul>
<p>This looks easy for such small matrix as ours (it is only 3x3). But how we could calculate all those numbers for bigger matrices (let’s say 9x7 one, for Saturday→Sunday transformation)?</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/f86427c789d3ed88f9e78be8d68f2d4f1ddcfbda/e4855/p/clubhouse-fun/clubhouse-agora-zerforschung-meme.jpg" alt="Coverimage"></p><h2 id="what-happened-so-far-">What happened so far …</h2><p>In our first <a href="https://zerforschung.org/posts/gespraeche-aus-dem-clubhouse/">thread on Clubhouse (in german)</a> we had only taken a superficial look at Clubhouse.</p><p>We saw that Clubhouse uses an external service provider called Agora.io for the voice call functionality.
Agora.io is also used by many other apps, including a therapy app.
In the thread we found that, among other things, we can easily listen to a room without being displayed to the other room participants if we communicate directly with Agora.</p><p>Conversely, you can also be displayed in a room without listening. However, this is not really a problem - after all, even outside Clubhouse you are often present in conversations without really listening.</p><h2 id="-and-what-happened-next-">… and what happened next …</h2><p>After we published <a href="https://twitter.com/zerforschung/status/1354218368782508037">the Twitter thread</a>, we tried to play sound directly through Agora.
This still worked after we left the room - we could still participate in conversations.</p><video controls="">
<source src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/87d9be48b5f4f855673557bd2268476398ece4b3/461a7/m/clubhouse-fun/leave-room.mp4" type="video/mp4"><source src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/4564cee5098f5e5234844c16aec2dc45977a4e00/363c4/m/clubhouse-fun/leave-room.webm" type="video/webm"></video><p>Of course, we only tested the whole thing in private rooms so as not to disturb anyone.
The standard behaviour of Clubhouse in private rooms is that all participants are allowed to speak.
Clubhouse also has the feature of a virtual stage, especially for larger, public rooms.
Only those who have been brought onto this stage can speak audibly for the whole room, the rest remain in the virtual audience and can only listen.
After our previous experience, we suspected something bad, so we moved our test account to the Audience.
As expected, everyone in the room was immediately informed that the account could no longer speak and was now in the audience.
However, this account could continue to play sound without any problems, which could be heard throughout the room.</p><video controls="">
<source src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/b35bc8c3ac3e24ff95ec32e6017d65e218a74f3e/73335/m/clubhouse-fun/move-audience.mp4" type="video/mp4"><source src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/9cec51ef49da99794acc961a9cdb172d61110a7e/2b71f/m/clubhouse-fun/move-audience.webm" type="video/webm"></video><p>Again, the behaviour can be combined with the original discovery - the account can leave the room and then not only continue to listen, but also play sound that is transmitted to everyone in the room.</p><p><strong>Note</strong>: In public rooms, we must have been on stage at least once to speak. After that, however, no one can take away our permission to speak.
You can also activate the virtual stage in private rooms. We can always speak there, even if we had only been in the audience since joining the room.</p><hr><p>Unfortunately, the only feature of Clubhouse that a room moderator could use to prevent unwanted participants (and their audio) is also broken: the eject button.
This “Remove from Room” button only asks the Clubhouse app of the respective user to leave the room.
If the app is modified, it can simply ignore this request and remains in the room.</p><p>If you talk directly to the audio service provider Agora, all the moderation options of the Clubhouse app have no effect. The possibility to play sound continues to work until the room is finally closed for everyone.</p><video controls="">

But first we want to give Clubhouse enough time to fix the described problems.</p><p>We have informed Clubhouse about the problems but have not received any feedback at the time of publication.</p><p>However: We have decided to publish this article anyway before fixing the problems, because in our view these problems are unfortunately (too) easy to find and can cause some damage if not known.</p><p>However, after a quick skim of the Agora interface documentation and Clubhouse’s use of it so far, we estimate that fixing the problem might be a bit more difficult after all.
But the details and a few fun things we found will follow soon, so stay tuned 🚀✨</p><div><p>All our work is done in our spare time, besides our jobs and general pandemic exhaustion.

</p>

<p>Hi! For <a href="http://sigbovik.org/2016/">SIGBOVIK 2017</a>, I created a strange <a href="http://tom7.org/abc/paper.pdf">paper</a>. This one may be a bit impenetrable for non computer scientists. If you have the time, I think reading the paper is the best way to experience it. But I also created the following video that explains the ideas involved, for interested non-experts or patient experts. It's long, at about 25 minutes, but you can always just skip to the end:

<iframe width="853" height="480" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LA_DrBwkiJA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

</p><p>The paper in raw form is available as <a href="http://tom7.org/abc/paper.exe">PAPER.EXE</a> or <a href="http://tom7.org/abc/paper.txt">PAPER.TXT</a> (same file). Due to unreasonable SIGBOVIK deadlines, it's been updated a little compared to the version that appeared in SIGBOVIK 2017 (<a href="http://tom7.org/abc/abc.bib">bibtex</a>).

</p><p>The source code I used to create the paper is <a href="http://sourceforge.net/p/tom7misc/svn/HEAD/tree/trunk/abc/">here</a>.</p>

  <p><span>opensource</span></p><p>21 Jul 2020</p>


<p>3 minute read</p>

<p>Open Source Software and especially large projects have a few defined standards that are used to promote welcoming new contributors and ensure a healthy collaborative environment like for example <code>CONTRIBUTING.md</code>, <code>CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md</code>, and <a href="https://github.blog/2016-02-17-issue-and-pull-request-templates/">issue/pull request templates</a>.</p>

<p>Despite this, even in popular projects, there is a disconcerting lack of guidance on the actual structure of the software and its inner workings</p>

<p>For example, as a part of the <a href="https://codein.withgoogle.com/archive/">open source Google Code-in event</a>, last winter I started contributing and still contribute to <a href="https://github.com/publiclab/">Public Lab</a>, an environmental community that develops environmental software.</p>

<p>This forum’s code base is relatively large, especially for an open source beginner. It has about ~25 controllers, ~30 models and a very complete testing suite with functional, unit and system testing all automated with Travis.</p>

<p>But I took some time and read through the code to understand how the different bits and pieces of the app interacted, and grew to a confident level with some parts and at least an abstraction of understanding with the others. I luckily also had the help of my mentors who answered my questions during this process.</p>

<p>Obviously, this mentorship is often unavailable and new contributors have to scrutinize the code base on their own, and try to come up with a vague understanding of the components that will prevent them from creating a breaking change in another part of the app.</p>

<p>For example, in other industries, usually physical blueprints serve as this stepping stone to provide an overview of how the product works as a whole and yet it’s often missing in software engineering.</p>

<p>Let’s take an example. I’ve been getting into the <a href="https://github.com/crystal-lang/crystal/">Crystal</a> programming language as a faster, type-checked alternative to Ruby. I really enjoyed the language and wanted to contribute and understand the code. I checked out their <a href="https://github.com/crystal-lang/crystal/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md"><code>CONTRIBUTING.md</code></a> and it provided me with mostly a social / collaborative overview of where I can discuss issues or ideas, where I can ask questions, etc… What it did <strong>not</strong> provide was a <strong>technical</strong> overview of how the code is structured, the way it all comes together and its tech stack.</p>

<p>Putting this information would be helpful to not put off curious contributors that want to learn and develop a higher-level understanding of how the project works.</p>

<p>These frustrations are pushing me to propose a new “standard” for welcoming open source contribution, an <code>ARCHITECTURE.md</code> file, that would work on top of <code>CONTRIBUTING.md</code> to inform on:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The tech stack, the backend / frontend / db / middleware technologies used</li>
  <li>The structure of the code and its logical links (diagrams :)), for example, crystal’s code is organised with <code>/src/modulename/submodule.cr</code> structure (ie <a href="https://github.com/crystal-lang/crystal/blob/master/src/csv/parser.cr"><code>/src/csv/parser.cr</code></a>, i.e. how does it all come together and what is the flow of the software. The <a href="https://www.infoq.com/articles/C4-architecture-model/">C4 model for software architecture</a> provide an instruction set for how engineers can use diagrams to easily explain their architecture.</li>
  <li>Specifications for testing and general guidelines on testing constraints for said project paired with details on the CI process</li>
</ul>

<p>It’s easy for the creators of a project to represent in their minds the way all the pieces of the project come together, but transcribing these pieces together into a document would be extremely beneficial, not only to teach others but also to clarify and renew one’s own understanding of their own code base.</p>

<p>If you have any other ideas for additional information it could contain, please comment! I think this could be incredibly useful in general to make access to open source projects easier and lower the learning curve.</p>

<p>As the pandemic runs its course, tracking genetic mutations has gained mainstream coverage. Officially, in the line of work we call bioinformatics, finding and understanding mutations is known as <em>Variant Calling</em>. In the same way every person is different from others (except twins), an individual virus can have variations in their genome; when a lot of these genetic variations accumulate between the virus we detected originally and what we find months later in a faraway town, we can say that we have a new <em>strain</em> of the virus. The Coronavirus which we’re now calling <em>SARS-CoV-2</em> was first detected in Wuhan中国, so the genetic sequencing data from here is used as the base reference genome, and we measure mutations for the virus detected everywhere else against this; a coronavirus genome from a few towns away might only have a couple letters of the genome different from the Wuhan data, while something that’s travelled to the other side of the world after being transmitted through many people, climates, and even treatments, might now have acquired many more genetic variants compared to the original data.</p>

When turning the molecules in genetic code into digital files these machines create strings that can be a few hundred letters in length to several thousand, but never the entire genome of the virus in a single string. A standardized file format called <em>fastq</em> holds all the strings from a single sample, including some quality data from the machine doing the sequencing. These strings are in no particular order, and first need to be mapped together to get the complete genome. Pretty much the standard way to create these genetic maps uses a technique invented in Palo Alto back in the early 90s by &nbsp;Michael Burrows and David Wheeler. The <em>Burrows–Wheeler Transform</em> was mostly just used in data compression, until around 2010 when computational biologists began to use it to align genomes together.</p>

<h4 id="table-1">Table 1.</h4>
<p><strong>SRA:</strong> <em>Sequence Read Archive</em> <strong>-Open Access</strong></p>

<p><strong>ENA:</strong> <em>European Nucleotide Archive</em> <strong>-Open Access</strong></p>

<p><strong>GISAID:</strong> <em>Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data</em> <strong>-Private</strong></p>

<p>Heng Li, now a professor at Harvard (amongst other things) has created the most commonly used alignment algorithm (amongst other things) with <a href="https://github.com/lh3/bwa">BWA</a>. This algorithm is super easy to use, and will get us results that are more than good enough.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>git clone https://github.com/lh3/bwa.git
cd bwa
make
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>BWA takes <strong>fastq</strong> files containing samples, along with a <em>fasta</em> file containing a reference genome to map the strings contained in our <strong>fastq</strong> file. Reference genomes are usually put out by the scientific wing of a National Government, Regional Organizations, and some Universities. We’ll get our Wuhan Coronavirus Reference genome from the <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/1798174254">National Center for Biotechnology Information</a> hosted by the US Federal government. A good sample to run against the Wuhan reference is the Washington state outbreak that happened early in the US, the <em>fastq</em> data for this is also hosted by the NCBI at their <a href="https://trace.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Traces/sra/?run=SRR11278092">Sequence Read Archive</a>. In the animated terminal above (Fig 2.) we see the commands needed to create our mapped genome from our input files, including retrieving the data from the databases . If you’d like to skip all that, we’re hosting both the reference genome, and the completed alignment map over at <a href="https://lucidalign.com/#cov">Lucid Align</a>. We’ll be using the <strong>bam</strong> file to detect our mutations, and we can also browse the genome of this Washington state outbreak sample using any sequence alignment viewer.</p>

  </iframe>
</p>

<p>But before going on to variant calling this first sample let’s just prepare another sample while we’re making these alignment maps. Let’s do a more recent outbreak, from Kent, UK; which is far from Wuhan &amp; the Washington sample, in both time &amp; space. Retrieving the samples from the European Nucleotide Archive can be done from this <a href="https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/ERR4659819">link</a> or from the shell.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>git clone https://github.com/enasequence/enaBrowserTools.git
cd python3
enaDataGet.py -f fastq -m -d [output_directory] ERR4659819
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Creating the mapped genome from the Kent, UK outbreak is done the exact same way as with the Washington state outbreak, and now both files can be browsed directly with an alignment viewer. More importantly now we can run the <em>variant detection</em> and see all the mutations in each of these samples compared to the original Wuhan reference genome. Variant callers are an area of hot development for folks working on bioinformatics algorithms &amp; tools. Traditionally, Bayesian methods have been most reliable, but are hard-coded for specific organisms or need the settings dialed-in to get the correct sensitivity to specificity. This is so that we don’t get too many false-positives, while at the same time don’t miss any real mutations. In the last couple of years deep convolutional neural networks have really made a splash in variant calling, where now images are created almost similar to those we see from alignment viewers, and those images are used to train, and then have the neural network make the call on whether there is a mutation in a given section of the alignment map as we make our way down the entire map.</p>

<p><img src="https://mokasquarl.github.io/images/eff_kent.png" alt="Annotated VCF" title="High Impact mutation in Kent UK sample"></p>
<h4 id="fig-4-annotated-mutations-of-kent-uk-strain-b117">Fig 4. Annotated Mutations of Kent UK Strain B.1.1.7</h4>

<p>Bayesian variant callers are fairly simple to install, whereas the DCNN callers will need, in our case, Nvidia cuda drivers, and of course a machine with those GPUs. You could use <a href="https://magnolia.sh/">Magnolia</a> Fig 3., the super-cool neural network based caller that Leo van Driel helped write B-), but for this post we are going to use the built-in caller that comes with <a href="http://www.htslib.org/download/"><em>samtools</em></a> written by the previously mentioned Heng Li.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>bcftools mpileup -Ou -f &lt;ref.fasta&gt; &lt;sample1.bam&gt; | bcftools call -vmO z -o &lt;study.vcf.gz&gt;
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>After running any variant caller, we’re left with a <em>vcf</em> file, which is just a list of positions in a genome where the sample has a mutation compared to the reference, it might be good to just look at the file <a href="https://samtools.github.io/hts-specs/VCFv4.2.pdf">format specifications</a> to understand how these <em>vcf</em> files will be used moving forward. We can use the allotted fields in the <em>vcf</em> format to annotate, that is give meaning &amp; context to each of the mutations we detect in the genome. For this sample we’ve used <a href="https://pcingola.github.io/SnpEff/users_of_snpeff/">SnpEff</a> which makes life super easy by boiling all of the predicted effects of each of the mutations we detected into 3 simple categories, high impact, low, and moderate.</p>

<p>We can see in Fig 4. that running a standard Bayesian variant caller we detected a total of 48 mutations in the Kent UK sample. However, there might be some false-positives in there, it’s always better to be a bit more sensitive than to miss things. Let’s focus on the high impact mutations, things that will change the 3D structure of coronavirus. Looks like we only have 3 of those, all highlighted in red (Fig 4.), at genomic positions, 11288, 27972, and 28270. The VCF file we generated also contains data on which amino acids within the protein structure were changed to what, we can use that information to make the changes in our molecular structure, which in this case we’ve done with a current tool under development.</p>
<h4 id="fig-5-molecular-structure-editor">Fig 5. Molecular Structure Editor</h4>
<p><img src="https://mokasquarl.github.io/images/dalton_beta.gif" alt="Dalton PDB" title="Editing Molecular Structure"></p>

<p>Mutations which change the molecular structure are super important because that is more likely to make things behave differently, this can mean it attaches to human receptors more tightly, interacts with antibodies and drugs differently, because remember at the core of how molecules behave is the old mantra <strong>“form equals function.</strong>”</p>

February 13, 2021 | https://whitmanwire.com/opinion/2021/02/09/op-ed-whitman-proposes-deep-cuts-to-humanities-arts-and-languages/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://whitmanwire.com/opinion/2021/02/09/op-ed-whitman-proposes-deep-cuts-to-humanities-arts-and-languages/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div role="main"><p><span><p>This week, news was shared with a number of alumni about a recent proposal to generate budget savings through deep cuts to academic programs at Whitman. The proposal was created in response to a crisis in College finances brought on by COVID-19. Among the proposed cuts are six tenure-line positions in Classics, Environmental Humanities, History, Japanese, Mathematics and Statistics and Philosophy that will be eliminated after professors retire. Non-tenure-line positions in numerous other disciplines would also be cut, including Studio Art, Art History and Visual Culture Studies, Biology, Chinese, French, Japanese, Music, Politics, and Theater and Dance. Some adjunct faculty will not get their contracts renewed, while others will see their positions reduced. 68 percent of the faculty cuts are to the humanities and arts, and the cuts amount to 13.7 percent of the total humanities and arts faculty. Languages are taking a particularly big hit, with the proposed elimination of 24 percent of the total language faculty leading to the likely losses of the Classics, Chinese and Japanese majors. The future of the Environmental Humanities major will also be uncertain.</p>
<p>These cuts were developed by a Financial Sustainability Review committee and have blindsided the Faculty. They go against Whitman’s stated Strategic Priorities and violate the principle of shared governance, which gives the Faculty control over the curriculum. Last year, the Faculty were in the process of voting to strengthen the role of language study and environmental literacy in the General Education program. Some of the positions being cut, held by beloved retiring professors, are ones the Faculty previously identified as top priorities for hiring. The cuts also fall heavily on academics rather than on non-academic offices and programs in the College. Some of the proposed cuts, like the reduction of Classics faculty leading to the elimination of Latin and Greek language instruction and the major, are out-of-step with peer institutions. Others, like the loss of Don Snow’s position in Environmental Humanities after his retirement, will throw into doubt the future of a signature Whitman program.</p>
<p>More broadly, cutting nearly one seventh of the humanities and arts faculty will alter the future direction of the College. While crafted in response to the current crisis, the proposed changes will last far beyond it. President Murray communicated that the positions lost this year are unlikely to be reinstated in future years. They thus constitute a long-term shift in resources away from the arts and humanities.</p>
<p>Before the College embarks on such a significant change of course, it could stand to reflect on the value of the humanities, arts and languages at Whitman and in the world. However, the administration has indicated that it has no interest in doing this. The President and the Board of Trustees have given a deadline of February 15 to submit feedback on these proposed cuts. That said, some reflection on the value of the humanities and arts might be in order. The last few years have been tumultuous, and many of the problems we face are precisely what the humanities and arts are primed to address. Confronting political crises and fake news and working for social justice all require the creative, critical thinking that is developed in the very departments being cut. Language study and the intercultural awareness it facilitates are crucial to living in a multicultural, globalized world. As a liberal arts college, Whitman is the place for the in-depth study of the arts and humanities. A robust humanities faculty is one of the hallmarks of a Whitman education. In proceeding with these cuts, Whitman is jeopardizing not only its status as a liberal arts college, but also its mission of preparing students for lives of purpose.</p>
<p>Students and alumni who wish to speak up about these changes or the way they are taking place are encouraged to send their feedback (in separate emails) to President Murray, Professor Barry Balof and Professor Sharon Alker by February 15. Share your personal experience with any of the affected disciplines. Why is the discipline important to you? How did it shape your Whitman experience? Did it influence your decision to attend Whitman? How has it prepared you for life after Whitman?</p>
<p>Financial sustainability is essential to the continuing existence of Whitman College, but so are the arts and humanities. These cuts will transform the nature of the College, but they are not set in stone yet. As an alumni of the Divest Whitman campaign that successfully persuaded the College to divest its endowment of fossil fuel holdings, I know that when there is a groundswell of community sentiment on an issue, the College listens. Make your voice heard while there is still time. Speak up for the humanities, arts and languages at Whitman.</p>

<p>In solidarity with Whitties past, present and future,</p>

            <!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>The most common tool for background jobs in Ruby on Rails is Sidekiq. Unfortunately, it's not standalone and it has Redis as a dependency. In this post, I will present an alternative approach for scheduling tasks in Rails.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Oh come on! What's the problem with Sidekiq? It's well tested and widely used in many production apps!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Please remember that I focus on product bootstrapping. Time to market is crucial. I'm also a one-man army and I try to minimize any unneeded maintenance.</p>
<p>To be able to use Sidekiq you need to set up and maintain a new service with Redis. It takes time and effort. I was looking for a solution to quickly implement scheduled jobs without any overhead for my Rails app: <a href="https://getaproductjob.com/?ref=kwcodes">Get a Product Job</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Fine, why cannot you just use cron?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I'm using <a href="https://render.com/">Render</a> and its services don't have cron out of the box.</p>
<h2 id="solution">Solution</h2>
<p>I decided to use <a href="https://www.integromat.com/?pc=kwcodes">Integromat</a>. It's a tool for automating processes and it has an attractive free tier (1000 operations/month). Just enough for small side projects.</p>
<p>How to glue it with the Ruby on Rails app?</p>

<p>What are the pros and cons of this approach?<br>
✅ Quick implementation.<br>
✅ No new layers to maintain (Redis + Sidekiq).<br>
✅ Money saved on new services (quite important when you're just starting out and validating ideas).</p>
<p>🚨 Not the safest solution. You might consider adding authorization or at least server-side checks to make sure that the task is not run too often.<br>
🚨 For some of you, Integromat free tier might not be enough.<br>
🚨 If not careful, you can easily exceed Integromat's free tier.</p>

<article>
    <p>It seems that networking equipment vendors have some tradition of using display connectors for other purposes.</p>
<p>HP, <a href="https://jackstromberg.com/2013/01/stacking-with-the-dell-powerconnect-5548s/">Dell</a> and Netgear use HDMI cables for stacking networking switches. According to <a href="https://serverfault.com/questions/408925/stacking-two-netgear-gs748ts-switches-via-hdmi-only-1gbps-trunk-bandwidth">this</a> Serverfault answer, a HDMI 1.3 or 1.4 compliant cable is needed for achieving the near 10Gbit theoretical throughput on Netgear hardware. The HDMI spec has specified the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HDMI#HEC">HDMI Ethernet Channel (HEC)</a>, but that is only 100BASE-T, so these vendors have made a different implementation.</p>
<p>Cisco is known to use the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low-force_helix">60-pin low-force helix</a> connector for their legacy <a href="https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/interfaces-modules/1700-2600-3600-3700-1-port-serial-wan-interface-card/7265-hw-1t-wic.html">Serial WAN Interface Card (WIC-T1)</a>. It is typically used as a display connector on workstations, because it enables connecting up to 4 displays through a single connector.</p>
<p><img src="https://eloydegen.com/blog/images/cisco_lfh.jpg" alt="Connector"></p>
<p>3Com used the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DB13W3">DB13W3</a> with the Dual Speed Hub 500 for a redundant DC power supply connection. Even though the connector itself is slightly different because the pins in the large holes are missing, a standard DB13W3 cable seems to fit. I don’t have this hub so I haven’t tested it myself, but I would be suprised if it doesn’t fit. I hope nobody their office burned down because a DB13W3 intended for displays was used instead.</p>
<p><img src="https://eloydegen.com/blog/images/DB13W3_connector.jpg" alt="Connector"></p>
<p>The connector is specified further in the manual:</p>
<p><img src="https://eloydegen.com/blog/images/Number8.png" alt="Number 8 description"></p>
<h2 id="legality">Legality</h2>
<p>If there isn’t a patent or copyright on the design of the connector and the official logo or name is not used, then I think it’s legal, but this does not seem to be the case with HDMI®.</p>
<p>The official Dell manual is calling it “HDMI Ports”, but those ports are certainly not implementing the HDMI protocol. I wonder if any lawyers would argue that this is a trademark infringement.</p>

For an $n \times n$ magic square, the magic constant is</p><center> $\begin{align*} \dfrac{1}{n} \sum_{k=1}^{n^2} k \end{align*}$ </center><p>For example, a magic square with dimensions $3 \times 3$ would have magic constant $15,$ and dimensions $4 \times 4$ would have magic constant $34.$</p><p>To solve a magic square, we must fill in each element with a number in ${1, 2, \ldots, n^2 },$ and each number must appear exactly once. A $3 \times 3$ magic square could look like this:</p><center> $\begin{align*} \begin{bmatrix} 2 &amp; 7 &amp; 6 \\ 9 &amp; 5 &amp; 1 \\ 4 &amp; 3 &amp; 8 \end{bmatrix} \end{align*}$ </center><p>Or this:</p><center> $\begin{align*} \begin{bmatrix} 8 &amp; 3 &amp; 4 \\ 1 &amp; 5 &amp; 9 \\ 6 &amp; 7 &amp; 2 \end{bmatrix} \end{align*}$ </center><p>It may seem like a $3 \times 3$ magic square can have multiple solutions. But looking closer allows us to see that the two matrices above are actually both the same configuration. The second matrix is just the first matrix rotated $180$ degrees. In general, rotating and flipping a magic square in any direction will still yield a valid magic square.</p><h2>Solving a Magic Square Using Brute Force</h2><p>How can we build a program to construct one of these magic squares?</p><p>Just like every problem, the simplest way to solve a magic square is to use brute force. It will be the most inefficient solution we can think of, but it will give us some grounding to see which areas we need to improve it in. To get some code down, we can write something like this:</p><p><span size="3em"> <!-- HTML generated using hilite.me --><div><pre><span>def</span> <span>gen_magic_square</span>():

</pre></div></span></p><p>The classic $9$-nested-for-loop approach. It is quite inefficient, but it will do the job. Each $x_k$ variable represents a space in the square. There are 9 spaces, so we nest $9$ loops, $1$ for each space. Each loop will loop through all the possible numbers in that space, $1$ through $9.$</p><p>To write the <code>is_valid</code> function, we need to check for duplicate values, which can easily be done with the use of a set. Then we have to check if each row, column, and diagonal adds up to a certain number, so we can just make a list of all those and check if they are equal to $15$ at the end.</p><p><span size="3em"> <!-- HTML generated using hilite.me --><div><pre><span>def</span> <span>is_valid</span>(square, n):

For a $3 \times 3$ square, we would set $n=15.$ For a $4 \times 4$ square, we would set $n=34.$</p><h2>Brute Force Takes Forever!</h2><p>Let’s talk about timing. We have $9$ nested for loops, and the <code>is_valid</code> operation is in the deepest one. Since each loop is going to run $9$ times to test each number $1-9$ in each element of the square, it’s going to run the <code>is_valid</code> function $9^9$ times, which is absolutely insane.</p><p>Using Python’s <code>timeit</code> module, we can see how long the <code>is_valid</code> function takes to run:</p><ul><li>$1.6 \, \mu\textrm{s}$ to run if there are duplicate values</li><li>$5.3 \, \mu\textrm{s}$ to run if there are no duplicate values</li><li>$6.3 \, \mu\textrm{s}$ to run if the square is valid</li></ul><p>With this brute force algorithm, we can expect that the vast majority of iterations are going to have duplicate values in them. So, I’ll be generous and say that each time it runs, $1.6 \, \mu\textrm{s}$ pass. That means the amount of time it takes is $9^9 \times 1.6 \textrm{ usecs} \sim 10.3 \textrm{ minutes}.$</p><p>What if we wanted a $4 \times 4$ magic square? Well, we can use the equation again: $16^{16} \times 1.6 \mu\textrm{s} \sim \textbf{600 millennia}.$ It’s very unlikely that the human race will even exist for that long; we might have destroyed the earth along with the computer that was running this algorithm by then. We need to write a more efficient algorithm.</p><h2>Backtracking</h2><p>The problem with brute force is that it spends too much time looking through solutions that will never work. For example, the algorithm starts out with the square</p><center> $\begin{align*} \begin{bmatrix} 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 1\\ 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 \\ 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 \end{bmatrix}, \end{align*}$ </center><p>and then advances to</p><center> $\begin{align*} \begin{bmatrix} 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 1\\ 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 \\ 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 2 \end{bmatrix}, \end{align*}$ </center><p>and then</p><center> $\begin{align*} \begin{bmatrix} 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 1\\ 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 \\ 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 3 \end{bmatrix}. \end{align*}$ </center><p>There’s absolutely no point in checking any square with the first $3$ numbers as $1$ because we’re not allowed to have duplicates.</p><p>To avoid configurations like $1,1,1$ as the top row, we can use a technique called <b>backtracking</b>. Whenever we reach a configuration that won’t work, we “backtrack” and skip over that configuration instead of wasting tons of time modifying it in ways that will never make it valid.</p><p>Using backtracking, we would skip over all configurations that have duplicates, and instead start out with</p><center> $\begin{align*} \begin{bmatrix} 1 &amp; 2 &amp; 3\\ 4 &amp; 5 &amp; 6 \\ 7 &amp; 8 &amp; 9 \end{bmatrix}. \end{align*}$ </center><p>To implement backtracking, we’ll start by skipping over configurations with duplicates. In each for loop, before entering the next loop, we will check if the number has been duplicated anywhere. We will only check the rest of the square if the number isn’t duplicated. Implementing this, we end up with the following code:</p><p><span size="3em"> <!-- HTML generated using hilite.me --><div><pre><span>def</span> <span>gen_magic_square</span>()

</pre></div></span></p><p>Once we run this code, we notice a massive improvement in performance! Within only a couple of seconds, our algorithm actually finds multiple squares.</p><p>With this new algorithm, we skip all squares which repeat numbers, which will always be invalid. So, we are looping through all permutations. We can expect to run the validation function about $P(10, 9) = 3,628,800$ times, which is much less than the $9^9$ times we had to check last time.</p><p>Now, this method speeds up our code, but by how much? Theoretically, it takes $P(10, 9) * 1.6 \mu\textrm{s} \sim 5.8 \mu\textrm{s}$ to just run all the validations. (We introduced a bunch of ‘if’ statements in between each of the for loops, so it will take a bit longer in reality.) But the point is, our new algorithm works $10,600\%$ faster than the old one!</p><h2>Using a While Loop</h2><p>Still, we have another problem left, and that is the quality of the code. No one wants to have to look at a cascading abyss of for loops and if statements while writing their code, so let’s see if we can combine all this into a single while loop.</p><p>If you think about it, we can treat the square as a list of numbers instead of a list of rows. Instead of $[[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]],$ we can store the array as $[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9].$ Now, that means we will need a function to convert the flat list into a square:</p><p><span size="3em"> <!-- HTML generated using hilite.me --><div><pre><span>def</span> <span>arr_to_square</span>(arr):
    side_length <span>=</span> <span>int</span>(<span>len</span>(arr) <span>**</span> <span>0.5</span>)
    <span>return</span> [arr[i:i<span>+</span>side_length] <span>for</span> i <span>in</span> <span>range</span>(<span>0</span>, <span>len</span>(arr), side_length)]
</pre></div></span></p><p>Now, let’s think of how we can structure the while loop. We want the loop to keep going until both the value None is nowhere to be found in the list, and the square is valid. We can use the <code>or</code> operator to run the loop if <code>None</code> is in the square, or the square isn’t valid, like this:</p><p><span size="3em"> <!-- HTML generated using hilite.me --><div><pre><span>def</span> <span>gen_magic_square</span>(size):
    n <span>=</span> get_magic_const(size)
    square <span>=</span> [<span>None</span> <span>for</span> i <span>in</span> <span>range</span>(size<span>**</span><span>2</span>)]
    
    <span>while</span> <span>None</span> <span>in</span> square <span>or</span> <span>not</span> is_valid(arr_to_square(square), n):
        <span>pass</span>
        
    <span>return</span> arr_to_square(square)
</pre></div></span></p><p>You’ll notice I use the function <code>get_magic_const</code>, which computes the magic constant, like this:</p><p><span size="3em"> <!-- HTML generated using hilite.me --><div><pre><span>def</span> <span>get_magic_const</span>(side_length):
    <span>return</span> side_length<span>*</span>(side_length<span>**</span><span>2</span><span>+</span><span>1</span>)<span>/</span><span>2</span>

<p>Mental fog is often described as a “cloudy-headed” feeling.</p>
<p>Common conditions of brain fog include poor memory, difficulty focusing or concentrating, and struggling with articulation.</p>
<p>Imagine if you could concentrate your brain power into one bright beam and focus it like a laser on whatever you wish to accomplish.</p>
<p>Many people struggle to concentrate. And when you can’t concentrate, everything you do is harder and takes longer than you’d like.</p>
<h3><strong>Give up the&nbsp;clutter</strong></h3>
<p>Mess creates stress.</p>
<p>There’s a strong link between your physical space and your mental space.</p>
<p>Clutter is bad for your mind and health. It can create long-term, low-level anxiety.</p>
<p>When the book, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://amzn.to/2tvOPr0" data-href="http://amzn.to/2tvOPr0" target="_blank"><em>The Japanese Art of Reorganizing and Decluttering</em></a><em>,</em> by Marie Condo became a best-seller, it wasn’t too surprising.</p>
<p>We are all looking for ways to create more meaningful lives with less to distract us.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong><em>Get rid of clutter at your office, on your desk, in your room, and you will send a clear message of calm directly to your brain.</em></strong></p></blockquote>
<p>Start decluttering today in small, focused bursts. You’re not going to clean up your entire space in a day, so start small to make it a daily habit that sticks.</p>
<p>Set yourself up for success by making a plan and targeting specific areas you’re going to declutter, clean up, and organize over a prolonged period of time.</p>
<h3>Multi-tasking doesn’t&nbsp;work</h3>
<p>The ability to multi-task is a false badge of honor.</p>
<p>Task switching has a severe cost.</p>
<p>Your concentration suffers when you multitask.</p>
<p>It compromises how much actual time you spend doing productive work, because you’re continually unloading and reloading the hippocampus/short term memory.</p>
<p>Research shows that tasks switching actually burns more calories and fatigues your brain – reducing your overall capacity for productive thought and work.</p>
<p>Commit to completing one task at a time.</p>
<p>Remove potential distractions (like silencing your mobile, turning off email alerts ) before you start deep work to avoid the temptation to switch between tasks.</p>
<p><strong>Use the 3-to-1 method!</strong></p>
<p>Narrow down your most important tasks to 3, and then give one task your undivided attention for a period of time.</p>
<p>Allow yourself to rotate between the three, giving yourself a good balance of singular focus and variety.</p>
<h3>Give up the urgent distraction</h3>
<p>Disconnect. Your productivity, creativity and next big idea depends on it.</p>
<p>Urgency wrecks productivity. Urgent but unimportant tasks are major distractions.</p>
<p>Last-minute distractions are not necessarily priorities.</p>
<p>Sometimes important tasks stare you right in the face, but you neglect them and respond to urgent but unimportant things.</p>
<p>You need to reverse that. It’s one the only ways to master your time.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong><em>Your ability to distinguish urgent and important tasks has a lot to do with your success.</em></strong></p></blockquote>
<p>Important tasks are things that contribute to your long-term mission, values, and goals. Separating these differences is simple enough to do once, but doing so continually can be tough.</p>
<h3>Stop feeding your&nbsp;comfort</h3>
<p>Comfort provides a state of mental security.</p>
<p>When you’re comfortable and life is good, your brain can release chemicals like dopamine and serotonin, which lead to happy feelings.</p>
<p>But in the long-term, comfort is bad for your brain.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong><em>Without mental stimulation dendrites, connections between brain neurons that keep information flowing, shrink or disappear altogether.</em></strong></p></blockquote>
<p>An active life increases dendrite networks and also increase the brain’s regenerating capacity, known as plasticity.</p>
<p>“Neglect of intense learning leads plasticity systems to waste away,” says Norman Doidge in his book, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://amzn.to/2Fnh3to" data-href="http://amzn.to/2Fnh3to" target="_blank">The Brain That Changes Itself</a>.</p>
<p>Michael Merzenich, a pioneer of plasticity research, and author of <a rel="nofollow" href="https://amzn.to/2oXkPj3" data-href="http://amzn.to/2oXkPj3" target="_blank">Soft-wired: How the New Science of Brain Plasticity Can Change Your Life</a> says that going beyond the familiar is essential to brain health.</p>
<p>“It’s the willingness to leave the comfort zone that is the key to keeping the brain new,” he says.</p>
<p>Seeking new experiences, learning new skills, and opening the door to new ideas inspire us and educate us in a way improves mental clarity.</p>
<h3>Don’t sit&nbsp;still</h3>
<p>Sitting still all day, every day, is dangerous.</p>
<p>Love it or hate it, physical activity can have potent effects on your brain and mood.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong><em>The brain is often described as being “like a muscle”. Its needs to be exercised for better performance.</em></strong></p></blockquote>
<p>Research shows that moving your body can improve your cognitive function.</p>
<p>30–45 minutes of brisk walking, three times a week, can help fend off the mental wear and tear.</p>
<p>What you do with your body impinges on your mental faculties.</p>
<p>Find something you enjoy, then get up and do it. And most importantly, make it a habit.</p>
<h3>Stop consuming media and start creating&nbsp;instead</h3>
<p>It’s extremely easy to consume content.</p>
<p>You are passive. Even relaxed.</p>
<p>But for each piece of unlimited content you consume, it stops a piece of content you could have created.</p>
<p>Limit your mass media consumption.</p>
<p>Embrace the creation habit.</p>
<p>Start paying attention to the noise that you let seep into your eyes and ears.</p>
<p>Ask, Is this benefitting my life in any way?</p>
<p>Does all this information make me more prone to act?</p>
<p>Does it really make me more efficient? Does it move me forward in any significant way?</p>
<p><strong>Let creation determine consumption.</strong></p>
<p>Allow curiosity to lead you to discover and pursue something you deepy care about. Make time to create something unique.</p>
<p>The point is to get lost in awe and wonder like you did when you were a child. When you achieve that feeling from a certain activity, keep doing it!</p>
<p>Share your authentic self with the rest of us.</p>

Of course you would. Who doesn’t want to behave and think more reasonably? Good news: New <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41599-021-00712-1.epdf?sharing_token=X5MjwLDRSAiHhYFktvZ76lxOt48VBPO10Uv7D6sAgHujAy2n79E2tUrp3HAv2i2Rrv1or3LrbmAiE9eh_bR3MkKnec-0-hNfUvcab7_4M1ok7U8kigFHdoAAa1GE9E9bFZBKLcGwfALPGhRiaNM-YdOySqPSSQinxc3Z2msPPzI=" target="_blank">research</a>, from Harvard psychologist Ellen Langer, suggests mindfulness, or at least an aspect of it, can help. By “<a href="https://nautil.us/issue/16/nothingness/an-atheists-guide-to-spirituality" target="_blank">mindfulness</a>”—a feature of Buddhism for thousands of years, and a subject of scientific investigation for a few decades—most people mean a mental state you can be in. Let’s try.</p><p>Pay attention to your current sensations—the feeling of your back against a chair, or the weight of your phone in your hand. Pay attention to the thoughts and feelings flitting in your mind. Don’t “judge” them. Merely notice that they’re there. If you find yourself bringing past or possible future events into your imagination, let those drift off, and attend again to your present sensations, thoughts, and feelings. Not too difficult, right? Being mindful for a few seconds is easy. Being mindful for an hour is very difficult.</p><blockquote><p>It appears that mindfulness reduces cognitive bias, but these results need to be interpreted carefully.</p> </blockquote><p>One way to encourage people to be more mindful is to ask them to try to notice more things, and one way to measure mindfulness is to measure their ability to do so. Langer and her colleague Philip Maymin, of Fairfield University, used this aspect of mindfulness to try to reduce that familiar enemy of rationality—cognitive biases. There are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cognitive_biases" target="_blank">names</a> for over 100 of the systematic ways we think about the world irrationally. But it is likely that many are multiple names for the same underlying psychological process. (The tendency to give new names for things that already have names my colleague and I playfully call the <i>McKee-Davies bias</i>, which might be the first bias to be named as a result of itself.)<br></p><p>Maymin and Langer randomly divided 109 people into a “mindless” control group, a “low-mindful” group, and a “mindful” group. The low-mindful group chose their favorite of two random-dot patterns with subtle triangles. The mindful group looked at two slightly-less random images, and spotted hard-to-find differences between them. Then they looked at two nearly identical images of a fruit pile at once, and tried to spot which fruit, from one of the piles, was missing. Maymin and Langer measured people’s mindfulness using a survey, specifically a <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2158921#:~:text=Overall,%20the%20present%20study%20suggests,for%20both%20individuals%20and%20organizations." target="_blank">14-item measure</a> that focuses on flexibility of thinking and noticing new things (an admittedly Western conception of mindfulness).</p><p>The results confirmed that the mindful group, as a result of the attention they paid to their task, was actually mindful, and the mindless and low mindful groups were not.&nbsp;</p><p>The people in the mindful group also became more rational, in terms of bias. Maymin and Langer quizzed them on a bunch of questions measuring 22 cognitive biases that scientists have established. These included the conjunction fallacy (thinking that the amount of something specific is greater than the general category, like Republican bankers are more common than bankers), and the gambler’s fallacy (thinking that, after flipping a coin and getting “heads” a few times, “tails” will be more probable than 50 percent on the next roll). They found that the mindful group showed improvement on 19 out of the 22 biases.&nbsp;</p><p>It appears that mindfulness reduces cognitive bias, but these results need to be interpreted carefully. For one thing, although it purports to be about mindfulness in general, it is not clear the study’s intervention and mindfulness measure get at what people often take mindfulness to mean. For example, the training involved asking people to look for differences between photographs, and the Langer Mindfulness Scale, which the researchers used as a measure for mindfulness, asks questions about engagement, seeking novelty, and producing novelty. Although scientists have validated this measure, and found that it correlates with many things we would hope mindfulness would, neither the intervention nor the scale addresses thinking about the future, judgment of thoughts, focus, or <a href="https://nautil.us/blog/the-problem-with-mindfulness" target="_blank">mindfulness meditation</a> (the practice of doing nothing but sitting, or sometimes walking, and paying attention to the here and now). So, this study does not show evidence that your rationality is improved by being mindful in the sense of how you go about dealing with your own thoughts.&nbsp;</p><p>It might be better to interpret these findings as showing that cognitive bias can be reduced by encouraging people to pay closer perceptual attention to their environment—an important aspect of mindfulness, which many people often think of as a stress reducer that, practiced regularly and enough, can lead to a happier life.</p><div id="inpagesub">

</div><p>It’s too bad people generally aren’t very mindful. A 2010 <a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/330/6006/932.full" target="_blank">study</a> found that people’s minds wandered 47 percent of the time, and the only activity that people reliably focus on is making love. If you’re pretty well-trained in mindfulness meditation, you can mindfully do anything.&nbsp;</p><p>Is it better to be mindful? There is some evidence that, in general, people are happier if they are thinking about what they’re doing, even if that thing isn’t any fun, like washing the dishes. However, there is also <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2005-13229-002" target="_blank">evidence</a> that thinking about happy things from your past (nostalgia) increases pain tolerance, positive mood, empathy, and creativity, and reduces anxiety, boredom, and stress. So, though mindfulness is generally good, it’s perhaps not something to strive for at <i>every</i> moment. When vacationers <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2837207/" target="_blank">look forward</a> to their trips, for example, they’re a little happier. These results show that sometimes thinking about the past and the future can make you happier.</p><p>It’s encouraging to know that merely paying attention to the details of your environment, what Langer calls&nbsp;“<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SSde3wV3-Qc&amp;t=0m50s" target="_blank">active noticing</a>,” can make you a little more rational.</p><p><i>Jim Davies is a professor at the Department of Cognitive Science at Carleton University.

            <section>
                <div>
                    <p>Dear Alpha community, our partners, and DeFi users, as we have shared earlier, we have closed the loophole that made the exploit possible. We’d like to take this opportunity to thank everyone who has helped us, be it on the technical front and non-technical front. We sincerely appreciate it. We are investigating with the relevant parties and will investigate with the authorities to trace the attacker.</p><p>Now, we would like to share a post mortem on the recent Alpha Homora V2 exploit to explain</p><p><strong>1. What happened</strong></p><p><strong>2. Who is affected</strong></p><p><strong>3. What’s next and</strong></p><p><strong>4. Walk through of technical analysis of what happened.</strong></p><p>This exploit is complicated, involving more than 9 transactions. We hope this thorough post mortem will not only be helpful to the Alpha community and our partners, but also to other projects and builders in DeFi.</p><p>This moment shows how important it is to continue helping each other out and building a safer DeFi ecosystem for everyone. Alpha team is committed to building and helping builders in the space to create a stronger and safer DeFi ecosystem.</p><h2 id="what-happened">What happened?</h2><p>On Feb 13 5:37AM UTC, an attacker exploited Alpha Homora V2 using a series of complex transactions, which involved flashloans.</p><p>Here’s what the attacker need to know about the code and the setup in order to execute the attack:</p><ul><li>HomoraBankv2 has an sUSD pool on a contract level in preparation for the upcoming release, which is neither available on the UI nor publicly announced.</li><li>There was no liquidity in sUSD lending pool, so the attacker can fully manipulate and inflate the total debt amount and total debt share.</li><li>There is a rounding miscalculation in borrow function calculation, which only affects when the attacker is the sole borrower.</li><li>resolveReserve function can increase totalDebt without increasing totalDebtShare and the function, intended for collecting revenue to the reserve pool, can indeed be called by anyone.</li><li>HomoraBankv2 accepts any custom spell, as long as the invariant checks out that collateral &gt; borrow (a spell is similar to a strategy in Yearn).</li></ul><h2 id="who-is-affected">Who is affected?</h2><p><strong>The debt is not between users and Alpha Homora v2, but between Alpha Homora V2 and Cream V2. </strong>This is because Alpha Homora V2 is integrated with Cream V2 (Iron Bank) in a protocol-to-protocol lending way. Thus, the debt is between the two protocols and not the users. </p><p>Alpha team will work with Andre and Cream team to find remedial actions to resolve the debt.</p><p>Currently, borrowing (new leveraged positions and borrowing more to the existing positions) are now paused. Lenders can still lend. Leveraged yield farmers can still repay their debt, add collateral, and close the positions.</p><h2 id="what-s-next">What’s next?</h2><p>Alpha team will work with Andre and Cream team to find remedial action to resolve the debt. </p><p>The team, trusted builders in the space, and security experts will continue to investigate this exploit further, so we will continue to pause borrowing.</p><p>We will maintain a constant communication with our community.</p><p>Once the recheck and investigation is complete, Alpha Homora V2 and Iron Bank will continue to operate normally with more leveraged pools, more lending assets, more features, and better improvement. </p><p>While Alpha Homora V2 has gone through 2 audits by Quantstamp and PeckShield, we will not only work with more audit firms but also work with more trusted builders in the space to help read through the contracts.</p><p>This incident has helped us and will continue to help us bond stronger as a community, and we look forward to building a brighter and safer future.</p><h2 id="walk-through-of-technical-analysis">Walk through of technical analysis</h2><ul><li>Attacker address: 0x905315602ed9a854e325f692ff82f58799beab57</li><li>Attacker’s txs: <a href="https://etherscan.io/txs?a=0x905315602ed9a854e325f692ff82f58799beab57">https://etherscan.io/txs?a=0x905315602ed9a854e325f692ff82f58799beab57</a></li><li>Evil spell address:<br><a href="https://etherscan.io/address/0x560a8e3b79d23b0a525e15c6f3486c6a293ddad2">https://etherscan.io/address/0x560a8e3b79d23b0a525e15c6f3486c6a293ddad2</a></li></ul><h3 id="exploit-analysis">Exploit Analysis</h3><p><strong>1.</strong>The attacker created an evil spell (can think of this as equivalent to Yearn’s strategy). <a href="https://etherscan.io/tx/0x2b419173c1f116e94e43afed15a46e3b3a109e118aba166fcca0ba583f686d23">https://etherscan.io/tx/0x2b419173c1f116e94e43afed15a46e3b3a109e118aba166fcca0ba583f686d23</a></p><p><strong>2.</strong> Attacker swaps ETH -&gt; UNI, and supply ETH + UNI to Uniswap pool (obtaining ETH/UNI LP token).

<h2 id="Marc%20on%202021-02-12">Marc on 2021-02-12</h2>

<p>Despite increasing leniency on frameworks being the <em>only</em> way to build for the web<sup id="fnref1"><a href="#fn1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>, hand-written HTML never disappeared and I feel is still a perfectly suitable way to build a personal website.</p>

<p>This notion was spurred on a few weeks ago when I decided to do some decluttering on my machine: removing old files, temporary scratchpads, and the like…and then I got to my site directory. 875MB. Despite only containing a few blog posts (read: text files), my site was taking up more space than every Wikipedia article on Computer-Science combined, with 200MB+ still to spare.<sup id="fnref2"><a href="#fn2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> Where were these hundreds of megabytes coming from?</p>

<p>As it turns out <code>node_packages</code> was the root of the problem. Dependencies that required other dependencies. Packages so far removed from my end-point there was no way to even guess what purpose they served. As much as I enjoyed using <a href="https://www.gatsbyjs.com/">GatsbyJS</a> - my framework of choice, I couldn't carry on with a system that was in excess of my needs to such a degree.</p>

<p>With this - and a spare few days - I decided to start from scratch, plain HTML and CSS from the ground up. After a day or two I'd managed to piece together a site generator using various Bash scripts comprising of existing Unix commands that took care of almost all the functionality I had before. I was frankly amazed at how seamless the process was with programs like <code>sed</code> and <code>grep</code> being more than capable enough to blaze through converting pages, updating changes, and applying dynamic styling; All with no amorphous packages or hidden boilerplate, just tried-and-true HTML and a Unix toolbox with over 40 years of reliability.</p>

<p>Looking back I wondered why I'd ever thought using a framework was the right choice to begin with: The constant updates, packages fulfilling unknown roles, and boilerplate handling features I'll never use. I was left wondering how a system like this could survive over time.</p>

<p>I'm reminded of a comment I <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26019149">saw on Hacker News</a> stating that:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There's really too much for us to handle, so we build tools and services to help us manage all that information streaming towards us. But what we've forgotten is that we don't need to manage all the information out in the world, all we need to manage is however much we can ingest and digest. The bottleneck in our informational lives is absolutely not inventory management, it's the bandwidth between our ears, which is the same is it's always been.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Although this comment was made in the context of information overload online, I believe it is just as applicable to the increasingly amorphous capabilities of the tools and frameworks we use to power our sites and applications. A self-cannibalising cycle of being overloaded with the number of options presented to us so we create a new option, only to then overwhelm the next person that comes along <em>ad infinitum</em> (<a href="https://xkcd.com/927/">Relevant XKCD</a>).</p>

<p>I'm fully aware of the irony in chastising the excessive number of frameworks out there only to have created my own personal one, however I feel there is a key distinction between the two. My personal framework was created as a learning project to help me not only manage this site going forward but also gain a deeper understanding of the tools I use on a daily basis. Because this site is built with just the 3 core languages of the Web (HTML, CSS, and JS) that knowledge is not only going to be long lasting but also easily transferable, regardless of what Web-based projects I work on next. In addition, the Bash scripts that help tie everything together are just Unix commands, programs that will be available almost anywhere I choose to work from.</p>

<p>When it comes to typical Web frameworks however, a considerable number are put out into the wild competing against each other claiming to be <em>the definitive</em> framework which only ends up muddying the matter. In addition, most require knowledge that is unique to that particular framework, making migration challenging. Of course, this is certainly not to say that all frameworks are bad and we should return to the Web of the 90's; A more complex Web will always require more complex tools. However, for smaller simpler use-cases like a personal blog, plain HTML can still do the job just fine.</p>

<p>Working in a Computing-Science related job/field inherently requires the continual learning of new skills. However, surely that time is better spent learning <em>new</em> skills rather than progressing to where we already were before? Is it not a better option to expand your knowledge of your current toolkit rather than move and start afresh with a new one purely because it is newer?</p>

<p>I don't have a particularly grand statement with this post other than that when building your site, don't just leap straight to using the latest and greatest framework or technology. HTML never went away, it is still the fundamental backbone of the Web no matter how many layers we heap on top of it. </p>

		<p><em>But they focus on building a social network instead</em></p>
<p>When <a href="https://twitter.com/LucaBongiorni/status/1359560585990537216">developpers</a> wake up in 2021 and discover that Linkedin is a business social network, Sales people have for a long time accepted that their linkedin account is one of their company's communication channel</p>
<p>Linkedin knows your connections, your past jobs, your customers, your main skills, what you are interested in, the number of employees in each company in the world, if a company is growing or shrinking, what companies say, who interact with them. They know as much of a company as the company itself. <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/emmawoollacott/2019/09/10/linkedin-data-scraping-ruled-legal/">Seeing how much they prevent scrapping</a> they know their data is valuable. As a result of that you can be sure that they use this data to solve big problems. Well no, they don't, their three main paying features are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Make people pay to send messages to other people</li>
<li>Give a few filters to search people</li>
<li>Let people post job offers</li>
</ul>
<p>And they are NOT EVEN good at it!</p>
<p>Despite that, they could help solving the two most difficult tasks of business: Finding customers and recruiting</p>
<h2>Recruiting</h2>
<p>I'm not going to say that hiring is broken, it is the same thing as dating. People don't know what they need nor want, so they talk to a few people until they find one that makes them feel good and then they hire him. I'm clearly not sure it is a much better process than picking random people in the crowd and hiring them, but at least they are happy about their choice.</p>
<p>There are two parts in the recruiting process:</p>
<ul>
<li>Finding qualified candidates</li>
<li>Interviewing them</li>
</ul>
<p>Even though Linkedin is not going to help interviewing candidates it can make finding qualified candidates much easier. Today the process to find candidates is the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Create vague job offers that almost use the same terms as Google job offers.</li>
<li>Publish it in your ATS</li>
<li>Wait for unqualified candidates to apply to your offer (unless you are Google, Apple, Facebook, Uber or any other trendy company)</li>
<li>In the meantime go on Linkedin, type a few keywords in the search bar, use a few criterias to get a list of candidates</li>
<li>Browse the list of candidates and verify one by one if the candidate really match the keywords you typed</li>
<li>Harass each candidates to get a call with him</li>
</ol>
<p>Why things need to be so complex when Linkedin knows if a user is available for a new position, knows how much money he needs, what are their skill, where he lives.</p>
<ul>
<li>How could Linkedin have not solved the "experience level" filters ? Have you ever used it ? It doesn't even somewhat work, it doesn't work at all. An actual intern can be tagged as an expert, and expert as an intern . Why can't I get a list of product managers with years of experience</li>
<li>Why Linkedin doesn't help recruiters find candidates by position ? Why recruiters have to know that: front-end engineer, front engineer, UI engineer, react developer, front developer all mean the same thing ?</li>
<li>Why Linkedin doesn't unify job position titles by company ? Software developers is the name in some companies, in others it is engineers, in others it is developers, in others it is consultants. Linkedin can figure all that, they have the data to do some clustering</li>
<li>Why when searching for product managers, Linkedin also suggests you people who are "production managers" ?</li>
<li>Why won't linkedin let recruiters search only people who have logged in on linkedin in the last 3 months and that are actually ok to be solicited ? yeah you can say you are open to work, but that's not the same thing, that's too tough.</li>
<li>Why Linkedin don't unify the recruiting process ? Let users say whatever they want on their profile but put them in a unified bucket. Is that so hard to do for a billion company ? How many attributes are necessary to classify a sales guy for example ? His years of experience, has a sold service, saas, software, physical stuff ... , how much money he wants. That seems to be far from being an impossible thing.</li>
<li>Why Linkedin doesn't help recruiters create useful job descriptions ?  Why do they let companies say things like :<ul>
<li>Excellent time-management skills and the ability to establish reasonable and attainable deadlines for resolution.</li>
<li>Have a service-oriented mind, be analytical, and have strong problem-solving skills.</li>
<li>Strong attention to detail and extremely well-organized.</li>
<li>Positive can-do attitude &amp; ability to work well with teams.</li>
<li>Good at communicating complex ideas and reaching out to different points of view.
Which company is looking for people who are not positive ? Who are badly organized ? Who are bad at communicating ? Who is not analytical ? Who doesn't take attention to details ?
Don't you have more important things to say ? Things like: Work from the office mandatory, can explain his work to non technical people, likes interviewing other engineers...</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Linkedin knows really well the candidate and the companies, why don't they actually try to help them communicate ? This market is HUGE. There are billions of dollars of recruiting fees spent every month (150 bn a year in the US)
And they are the only one that can offer that, as you need the data on at least the company or the candidates to make a product about recruiting. If you want to help candidates find job offers, you need data on business, and only linkedin has them. For example the number of employees ONLY linkedin has this data (and crunchbase a bit). As for if you want to offer a product for business, then you need to have candidates. And once again only Linkedin has this data.</p>
<h2>Finding customers</h2>
<p>When I talk about customers, I only mean business customers. Finding consumers is a different thing that I'm not sure Linkedin can help at.</p>
<p>So we are talking about B2B.
Here are the different ways to find customers:</p>
<ol>
<li>Pay people to tell people they know to buy your offer. ex: Digital marketing, Partnership, Physical marketing, invite existing customers to restaurant, strategic hiring, ...</li>
<li>Go to a place where people who work for the type of business you are interested in go. Talk to people, and pitch your offer. ex: Marketing events, Networking dinner, Conferences, ...</li>
<li>Pay people to find and convince businesses to buy your offer. ex: salespeople</li>
</ol>
<p>Linkedin is today the place most sales and marketing people find contact. And that sucks. A LOT !</p>
<p>Whether you are in 2. or 3. what you want from Linkedin is :</p>
<ul>
<li>Let you choose the type of company you are interested in</li>
<li>Find the employees responsible for the topic you are selling</li>
<li>Give you their email address</li>
</ul>
<p>Today it is impossible to filter companies, you can search them by name but that's all. There is an 'industry' filter, but, lol, complete garbage. You can find by location and company size though, and that works, which is pretty remarkable to finally find something that works.</p>
<p>And for finding employees it is pretty difficult for the same reason that searching for candidates doesn't work. With job position titles not being standardized you can't really search efficiently.</p>
<p>But even so. Imagine you found one person that you think may be interested about your offer. How do you actually make sure that this person is interested ? For most businesses the answer is : I will design a loop of 5 emails talking about the topic that I'm trying to sell. And I will send you an email every 4 days until you actually accept or refuse. If at the end of the 5 mails you had no response, I will contact another person in your company and send them the same 5 mails, until someone answers me.</p>
<p>For some of you that method can seem like harassment, and it is. But it is the only method available to find customers. Some are going to say that if people don't answer that's because they are not interested. Well it is impossible to say, sometimes people answer you after 5 emails and are actually pretty interested about what you are offering.</p>
<p>In an ideal world we would have a marketplace of needs and offers. You could push an offer to people who are really in the target group and you could find offers matching your needs. And for that, the bigger the marketplace the better. I'm not going to describe how this should work, or how this could work. But it is obvious that Linkedin is uniquely positioned to create that kind of service.</p>
<p>It is unfortunate that instead of that they are focusing on getting more businesses to pay to send InMail to unqualified users.</p>
<p>The data of linkedin is a goldmine but today it rests unused so that users can annoy their network with stupid clickbaik posts</p>

This time we are going to talk about how to interact with Outlook from Excel using macros, and also we are going to release a <strong>PoC where we turn Outlook into a keylogger</strong>. Please, take a seat and listen to the story.</p>  <p><em>We promise this is the last time <a href="https://twitter.com/TheXC3LL">@TheXC3LL</a> will publish about VBA. We have scheduled an exorcism this weekend to release his daemons, so he can write again about vulnerabilities and other stuff different to VBA.</em></p>  <p>In our first chapter we talked about the concept of <a href="https://adepts.of0x.cc/kerberoast-vba-macro/">“Hacking in a epistolary way”</a>, where we started to implement attacks and TTPs directly in VBA macros avoiding process injections, dropping binaries or calling external programs that are flagged (like Powershell). This time we are going to shift our focus to Outlook.</p> <p>First of all we have to say that you can interact with Outlook directly from other Microsoft Office apps via VBA using the object <code>Outlook.Application</code>. This means that we can abuse Outlook functionalities from within Excel, so we can look for confidential information inside the inbox or we can exfiltrate data via mails. To send a mail only a few lines are needed:</p> <div><div><pre><code><span>'https://docs.microsoft.com/es-es/office/vba/api/outlook.namespace</span>

This will move directly the mail to the Deleted folder, so it is a bit more stealthy. To fully erradicate the mail we need to locate the mail (as item) inside the Deleted folder and then call the method <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/es-es/office/vba/api/outlook.items.remove"><code>Remove</code></a> via MAPI.</p>  <p>The object <code>Outlook.Application</code> gives us also access to the namespace <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/es-es/office/vba/api/outlook.application.getnamespace">MAPI</a> and all its methods.

However both approaches can be executed <strong>inside</strong> Outlook via OTM files as we will see below.</p>  <p>In the last years various persistence methods related to Outlook were released and implemented in the tool <strong><a href="https://github.com/sensepost/ruler">Ruler</a></strong>. These methods were based on the execution of VBA code via <a href="https://sensepost.com/blog/2017/outlook-forms-and-shells/">Custom Forms</a> and <a href="https://sensepost.com/blog/2017/outlook-home-page-another-ruler-vector/">Home Pages</a>. Both attacks are now patched, so we have to move forward.</p> <p>Recently <a href="https://twitter.com/domchell">Dominic Chell</a> published the article <a href="https://www.mdsec.co.uk/2020/11/a-fresh-outlook-on-mail-based-persistence/">A Fresh Outlook on Mail Based Persistence</a> where the persistence is achieved dropping a <strong>VbaProject.OTM</strong> file that is later loaded by Outlook. This is the path that we choosed here. But instead of using a payload to get a shell or parasite a process with our C2, we are going to create a keylogger in pure VBA <strong>:)</strong>.</p> <p>Outlook is one of the long term alive programs in an average office computer. It is launched since the workday beginning and is not closed until the worker leaves the office, so makes sense to use it as a keylogger. The plan is quite simple: we need to build an Excel file that modifies the registry (so Outlook can execute macros freely) and drops the OTM file with our keylogger.</p> <p>As the registry key is under <code>HKEY_CURRENT_USER</code> we do not need special privileges to modify the value (by default it is set at level 3 <em>Notifications for digitally signed macros, all other macros disabled</em>) so we enable the load and execution of macros by changing the value to 1 (<em>Enable all Macros</em>):</p> <div><div><pre><code><span>Sub</span> <span>disable_macro_security</span><span>()</span>

</code></pre></div></div> <p>We use the Excel version (<code>Application.Version</code>) to calculate the right location of the key to be modified. After that the OTM file can be dropped to <code>Environ("appdata") &amp; "\Microsoft\Outlook\VbaProject.OTM"</code> (it can be packed inside a resource, form, or taken directly from internet and then read/unpack and dropped). It is nothing new, all the good ol’ techniques to drop files apply here, let’s move to the OTM contents and the keylogger.</p> <p>For our keylogger we are going to use the function <strong><code>NtUserGetRawInputData</code></strong> that is not documented in the MSDN. But as usual: if something is not covered by Microsoft, go and check ReactOS. Luckily it is <a href="https://doxygen.reactos.org/d0/dc0/ntstubs_8c.html#ad041c37a6375f9be19cac8f4636d468e">documented</a>:</p> <div><div><pre><code><span>DWORD</span> <span>APIENTRY</span> <span>NtUserGetRawInputData</span> 	<span>(</span> 	<span>HRAWINPUT</span>  	<span>hRawInput</span><span>,</span>

<p><em>Stephen Brennan • 16 January 2015</em></p><p>It’s easy to view yourself as “not a <em>real</em> programmer.”  There are programs out
there that everyone uses, and it’s easy to put their developers on a pedestal.
Although developing large software projects isn’t easy, many times the basic
idea of that software is quite simple.  Implementing it yourself is a fun way to
show that you have what it takes to be a real programmer.  So, this is a
walkthrough on how I wrote my own simplistic Unix shell in C, in the hopes that
it makes other people feel that way too.</p>

<p>The code for the shell described here, dubbed <code>lsh</code>, is available on
<a href="https://github.com/brenns10/lsh">GitHub</a>.</p>

<p><strong>University students beware!</strong> Many classes have assignments that ask you to
write a shell, and some faculty are aware of this tutorial and code.  If you’re
a student in such a class, you shouldn’t copy (or copy then modify) this code
without permission.  And even then, I would <a href="https://brennan.io/2016/03/29/dishonesty/">advise</a> against heavily relying on this tutorial.</p>

<h2 id="basic-lifetime-of-a-shell">Basic lifetime of a shell</h2>

<p>Let’s look at a shell from the top down.  A shell does three main things in its
lifetime.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Initialize</strong>: In this step, a typical shell would read and execute its
configuration files.  These change aspects of the shell’s behavior.</li>
  <li><strong>Interpret</strong>: Next, the shell reads commands from stdin (which could be
interactive, or a file) and executes them.</li>
  <li><strong>Terminate</strong>: After its commands are executed, the shell executes any
shutdown commands, frees up any memory, and terminates.</li>
</ul>

<p>These steps are so general that they could apply to many programs, but we’re
going to use them for the basis for our shell.  Our shell will be so simple that
there won’t be any configuration files, and there won’t be any shutdown command.
So, we’ll just call the looping function and then terminate.  But in terms of
architecture, it’s important to keep in mind that the lifetime of the program is
more than just looping.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>int</span> <span>main</span><span>(</span><span>int</span> <span>argc</span><span>,</span> <span>char</span> <span>**</span><span>argv</span><span>)</span>
<span>{</span>
  <span>// Load config files, if any.
</span>
  <span>// Run command loop.
</span>  <span>lsh_loop</span><span>();</span>

  <span>// Perform any shutdown/cleanup.
</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>EXIT_SUCCESS</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Here you can see that I just came up with a function, <code>lsh_loop()</code>, that will
loop, interpreting commands.  We’ll see the implementation of that next.</p>

<h2 id="basic-loop-of-a-shell">Basic loop of a shell</h2>

<p>So we’ve taken care of how the program should start up.  Now, for the basic
program logic: what does the shell do during its loop?  Well, a simple way to
handle commands is with three steps:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Read</strong>: Read the command from standard input.</li>
  <li><strong>Parse</strong>: Separate the command string into a program and arguments.</li>
  <li><strong>Execute</strong>: Run the parsed command.</li>
</ul>

<p>Here, I’ll translate those ideas into code for <code>lsh_loop()</code>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>void</span> <span>lsh_loop</span><span>(</span><span>void</span><span>)</span>

<p>Let’s walk through the code.  The first few lines are just declarations.  The
do-while loop is more convenient for checking the status variable, because it
executes once before checking its value.  Within the loop, we print a prompt,
call a function to read a line, call a function to split the line into args, and
execute the args.  Finally, we free the line and arguments that we created
earlier.  Note that we’re using a status variable returned by <code>lsh_execute()</code> to
determine when to exit.</p>

<h2 id="reading-a-line">Reading a line</h2>

<p>Reading a line from stdin sounds so simple, but in C it can be a hassle.  The
sad thing is that you don’t know ahead of time how much text a user will enter
into their shell.  You can’t simply allocate a block and hope they don’t exceed
it.  Instead, you need to start with a block, and if they do exceed it,
reallocate with more space.  This is a common strategy in C, and we’ll use it to
implement <code>lsh_read_line()</code>.</p>

<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The first part is a lot of declarations.  If you hadn’t noticed, I prefer to
keep the old C style of declaring variables before the rest of the code.  The
meat of the function is within the (apparently infinite) <code>while (1)</code> loop.  In
the loop, we read a character (and store it as an <code>int</code>, not a <code>char</code>, that’s
important!  EOF is an integer, not a character, and if you want to check for it,
you need to use an <code>int</code>.  This is a common beginner C mistake.).  If it’s the
newline, or EOF, we null terminate our current string and return it.  Otherwise,
we add the character to our existing string.</p>

<p>Next, we see whether the next character will go outside of our current buffer
size.  If so, we reallocate our buffer (checking for allocation errors) before
continuing.  And that’s really it.</p>

<p>Those who are intimately familiar with newer versions of the C library may note
that there is a <code>getline()</code> function in <code>stdio.h</code> that does most of the work we
just implemented.  To be completely honest, I didn’t know it existed until after
I wrote this code.  This function was a GNU extension to the C library until
2008, when it was added to the specification, so most modern Unixes should have
it now.  I’m leaving my existing code the way it is, and I encourage people to
learn it this way first before using <code>getline</code>.  You’d be robbing yourself of a
learning opportunity if you didn’t!  Anyhow, with <code>getline</code>, the function
becomes easier:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>char</span> <span>*</span><span>lsh_read_line</span><span>(</span><span>void</span><span>)</span>
<span>{</span>
  <span>char</span> <span>*</span><span>line</span> <span>=</span> <span>NULL</span><span>;</span>
  <span>ssize_t</span> <span>bufsize</span> <span>=</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span> <span>// have getline allocate a buffer for us
</span>
  <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>getline</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>line</span><span>,</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>bufsize</span><span>,</span> <span>stdin</span><span>)</span> <span>==</span> <span>-</span><span>1</span><span>){</span>
    <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>feof</span><span>(</span><span>stdin</span><span>))</span> <span>{</span>
      <span>exit</span><span>(</span><span>EXIT_SUCCESS</span><span>);</span>  <span>// We recieved an EOF
</span>    <span>}</span> <span>else</span>  <span>{</span>
      <span>perror</span><span>(</span><span>"readline"</span><span>);</span>
      <span>exit</span><span>(</span><span>EXIT_FAILURE</span><span>);</span>
    <span>}</span>
  <span>}</span>

  <span>return</span> <span>line</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This is not 100% trivial because we still need to check for EOF or errors while
reading. EOF (end of file) means that either we were reading commands from a
text file which we’ve reached the end of, or the user typed Ctrl-D, which
signals end-of-file. Either way, it means we should exit successfully, and if
any other error occurs, we should fail after printing the error.</p>

<h2 id="parsing-the-line">Parsing the line</h2>

<p>OK, so if we look back at the loop, we see that we now have implemented
<code>lsh_read_line()</code>, and we have the line of input.  Now, we need to parse that
line into a list of arguments.  I’m going to make a glaring simplification here,
and say that we won’t allow quoting or backslash escaping in our command line
arguments.  Instead, we will simply use whitespace to separate arguments from
each other.  So the command <code>echo "this message"</code> would not call echo with a
single argument <code>this message</code>, but rather it would call echo with two
arguments: <code>"this</code> and <code>message"</code>.</p>

<p>With those simplifications, all we need to do is “tokenize” the string using
whitespace as delimiters.  That means we can break out the classic library
function <code>strtok</code> to do some of the dirty work for us.</p>

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>If this code looks suspiciously similar to <code>lsh_read_line()</code>, it’s because it
is!  We are using the same strategy of having a buffer and dynamically expanding
it.  But this time, we’re doing it with a null-terminated array of pointers
instead of a null-terminated array of characters.</p>

<p>At the start of the function, we begin tokenizing by calling <code>strtok</code>.  It
returns a pointer to the first token.  What <code>strtok()</code> actually does is return
pointers to within the string you give it, and place <code>\0</code> bytes at the end of
each token.  We store each pointer in an array (buffer) of character
pointers.</p>

<p>Finally, we reallocate the array of pointers if necessary.  The process repeats
until no token is returned by <code>strtok</code>, at which point we null-terminate the
list of tokens.</p>

<p>So, once all is said and done, we have an array of tokens, ready to execute.
Which begs the question, how do we do that?</p>



<p>Now, we’re really at the heart of what a shell does.  Starting processes is the
main function of shells.  So writing a shell means that you need to know exactly
what’s going on with processes and how they start.  That’s why I’m going to take
us on a short diversion to discuss processes in Unix.</p>

<p>There are only two ways of starting processes on Unix.  The first one (which
almost doesn’t count) is by being Init.  You see, when a Unix computer boots,
its kernel is loaded.  Once it is loaded and initialized, the kernel starts only
one process, which is called Init.  This process runs for the entire length of
time that the computer is on, and it manages loading up the rest of the
processes that you need for your computer to be useful.</p>

<p>Since most programs aren’t Init, that leaves only one practical way for
processes to get started: the <code>fork()</code> system call.  When …</p></div></div>

<p>My first programming languages were Lisp, Scheme, and ML. When I later started to work in OO languages like C++ and Java I noticed that idioms that are standard vocabulary in functional programming (fp) were not so easy to achieve and required sophisticated structures. Books like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_Patterns">Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software</a> were a great starting point to reason about those structures. One of my earliest findings was that several of the GoF-Patterns had a stark resemblance of structures that are built into in functional languages: for instance the strategy pattern corresponds to higher order functions in fp (more details see <a href="#strategy">below</a>).</p>
<p>Recently, while re-reading through the <a href="https://wiki.haskell.org/Typeclassopedia">Typeclassopedia</a> I thought it would be a good exercise to map the structure of software <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_design_pattern#Classification_and_list">design-patterns</a> to the concepts found in the Haskell type class library and in functional programming in general.</p>
<p>By searching the web I found some blog entries studying specific patterns, but I did not come across any comprehensive study. As it seemed that nobody did this kind of work yet I found it worthy to spend some time on it and write down all my findings on the subject.</p>
<p>I think this kind of exposition could be helpful if you are:</p>
<ul>
<li>a programmer with an OO background who wants to get a better grip on how to implement complexer designs in functional programming</li>
<li>a functional programmer who wants to get a deeper intuition for type classes.</li>
<li>studying the <a href="https://wiki.haskell.org/Typeclassopedia">Typeclassopedia</a> and are looking for an accompanying reading providing example use cases and working code.</li>

<p>The <a href="https://wiki.haskell.org/wikiupload/8/85/TMR-Issue13.pdf">Typeclassopedia</a> is a now classic paper that introduces the Haskell type classes by clarifying their algebraic and category-theoretic background. In particular it explains the relationships among those type classes.</p>
<p>In this chapter I’m taking a tour through the Typeclassopedia from a design pattern perspective. For each of the Typeclassopedia type classes I try to explain how it corresponds to structures applied in software design patterns.</p>
<p>As a reference map I have included the following chart that depicts the Relationships between type classes covered in the Typeclassopedia:</p>

<li>Solid arrows point from the general to the specific; that is, if there is an arrow from Foo to Bar it means that every Bar is (or should be, or can be made into) a Foo.</li>

<li>Monad and ArrowApply are equivalent.</li>

<h3 id="data-transfer-object-functor">Data Transfer Object → Functor</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>In the field of programming a data transfer object (DTO) is an object that carries data between processes. The motivation for its use is that communication between processes is usually done resorting to remote interfaces (e.g., web services), where each call is an expensive operation. Because the majority of the cost of each call is related to the round-trip time between the client and the server, one way of reducing the number of calls is to use an object (the DTO) that aggregates the data that would have been transferred by the several calls, but that is served by one call only. (quoted from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transfer_object">Wikipedia</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Data Transfer Object is a pattern from Martin Fowler’s <a href="https://martinfowler.com/eaaCatalog/dataTransferObject.html">Patterns of Enterprise Application Architecture</a>. It is typically used in multi-layered applications where data is transferred between backends and frontends.</p>
<p>The aggregation of data usually also involves a denormalization of data structures. As an example, please refer to the following diagram where two entities from the backend (<code>Album</code> and <code>Artist</code>) are assembled to a compound denormalized DTO <code>AlbumDTO</code>:</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://martinfowler.com/eaaCatalog/dtoSketch.gif" alt=""><figcaption>DTO</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Of course, there is also an inverse mapping from <code>AlbumDTO</code> to <code>Album</code> which is not shown in this diagram.</p>
<p>In Haskell <code>Album</code>, <code>Artist</code> and <code>AlbumDTO</code> can be represented as data types with record notation:</p>
<div id="cb1"><pre><code><span id="cb1-1"><span>data</span> <span>Album</span> <span>=</span> <span>Album</span> {</span>
<span id="cb1-2"><span>    title       ::</span> <span>String</span></span>
<span id="cb1-3">  ,<span> publishDate ::</span> <span>Int</span></span>
<span id="cb1-4">  ,<span> labelName   ::</span> <span>String</span></span>
<span id="cb1-5">  ,<span> artist      ::</span> <span>Artist</span></span>
<span id="cb1-6">} <span>deriving</span> (<span>Show</span>)</span>
<span id="cb1-7"></span>
<span id="cb1-8"><span>data</span> <span>Artist</span> <span>=</span> <span>Artist</span> {</span>
<span id="cb1-9"><span>    publicName ::</span> <span>String</span></span>
<span id="cb1-10">  ,<span> realName   ::</span> <span>Maybe</span> <span>String</span></span>
<span id="cb1-11">} <span>deriving</span> (<span>Show</span>)</span>
<span id="cb1-12"></span>
<span id="cb1-13"><span>data</span> <span>AlbumDTO</span> <span>=</span> <span>AlbumDTO</span> {</span>
<span id="cb1-14"><span>    albumTitle  ::</span> <span>String</span></span>
<span id="cb1-15">  ,<span> published   ::</span> <span>Int</span></span>
<span id="cb1-16">  ,<span> label       ::</span> <span>String</span></span>
<span id="cb1-17">  ,<span> artistName  ::</span> <span>String</span></span>
<span id="cb1-18">} <span>deriving</span> (<span>Show</span>, <span>Read</span>)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>The transfer from an <code>Album</code> to an <code>AlbumDTO</code> and vice versa can be achieved by two simple functions, that perfom the intended field wise mappings:</p>
<div id="cb2"><pre><code><span id="cb2-1"><span>toAlbumDTO ::</span> <span>Album</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>AlbumDTO</span></span>
<span id="cb2-2">toAlbumDTO <span>Album</span> {title <span>=</span> t, publishDate <span>=</span> d, labelName <span>=</span> l, artist <span>=</span> a} <span>=</span></span>
<span id="cb2-3">  <span>AlbumDTO</span> {albumTitle <span>=</span> t, published <span>=</span> d, label <span>=</span> l, artistName <span>=</span> (publicName a)}</span>
<span id="cb2-4"></span>
<span id="cb2-5"><span>toAlbum ::</span> <span>AlbumDTO</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Album</span></span>
<span id="cb2-6">toAlbum <span>AlbumDTO</span> {albumTitle <span>=</span> t, published <span>=</span> d, label <span>=</span> l, artistName <span>=</span> n} <span>=</span></span>

<p>In this few lines we have covered the basic idea of the DTO pattern.</p>
<p>Now, let’s consider the typical situation that you don’t have to transfer only a <em>single</em> <code>Album</code> instance but a whole list of <code>Album</code> instances, e.g.:</p>
<div id="cb3"><pre><code><span id="cb3-1"><span>albums ::</span> [<span>Album</span>]</span>
<span id="cb3-2">albums <span>=</span></span>
<span id="cb3-3">    [</span>
<span id="cb3-4">      <span>Album</span> {title <span>=</span> <span>"Microgravity"</span>,</span>
<span id="cb3-5">             publishDate <span>=</span> <span>1991</span>,</span>
<span id="cb3-6">             labelName <span>=</span> <span>"Origo Sound"</span>,</span>
<span id="cb3-7">             artist <span>=</span> <span>Artist</span> {publicName <span>=</span> <span>"Biosphere"</span>, realName <span>=</span> <span>Just</span> <span>"Geir Jenssen"</span>}}</span>
<span id="cb3-8">    , <span>Album</span> {title <span>=</span> <span>"Apollo - Atmospheres &amp; Soundtracks"</span>,</span>
<span id="cb3-9">             publishDate <span>=</span> <span>1983</span>,</span>
<span id="cb3-10">             labelName <span>=</span> <span>"Editions EG"</span>,</span>
<span id="cb3-11">             artist <span>=</span> <span>Artist</span> {publicName <span>=</span> <span>"Brian Eno"</span>, realName <span>=</span> <span>Just</span> <span>"Brian Peter George St. John le Baptiste de la Salle Eno"</span>}}</span>
<span id="cb3-12">    ]</span></code></pre></div>
<p>In this case we have to apply the <code>toAlbumDTO</code> function to all elements of the list. In Haskell this <em>higher order</em> operation is called <code>map</code>:</p>
<div id="cb4"><pre><code><span id="cb4-1"><span>map</span><span> ::</span> (a <span>-&gt;</span> b) <span>-&gt;</span> [a] <span>-&gt;</span> [b]</span>
<span id="cb4-2"><span>map</span> _f []    <span>=</span> []</span>
<span id="cb4-3"><span>map</span> f (x<span>:</span>xs) <span>=</span> f x <span>:</span> <span>map</span> f xs</span></code></pre></div>
<p><code>map</code> takes a function <code>f :: (a -&gt; b)</code> (a function from type <code>a</code> to type <code>b</code>) and an <code>[a]</code> list and returns a <code>[b]</code> list. The <code>b</code> elements are produced by applying the function <code>f</code> to each element of the input list. Applying <code>toAlbumDTO</code> to a list of albums can thus be done in the Haskell REPL GHCi as follows:</p>
<div id="cb5"><pre><code><span id="cb5-1">λ<span>&gt;</span> <span>map</span> toAlbumDTO albums</span>
<span id="cb5-2">[<span>AlbumDTO</span> {albumTitle <span>=</span> <span>"Microgravity"</span>, published <span>=</span> <span>1991</span>, label <span>=</span> <span>"Origo Sound"</span>, artistName <span>=</span> <span>"Biosphere"</span>},</span>
<span id="cb5-3"> <span>AlbumDTO</span> {albumTitle <span>=</span> <span>"Apollo - Atmospheres &amp; Soundtracks"</span>, published <span>=</span> <span>1983</span>, label <span>=</span> <span>"Editions EG"</span>, artistName <span>=</span> <span>"Brian Eno"</span>}]</span></code></pre></div>
<p>This mapping of functions over lists is a basic technique known in many functional languages. In Haskell further generalises this technique with the concept of the <code>Functor</code> type class.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The <code>Functor</code> class is the most basic and ubiquitous type class in the Haskell libraries. A simple intuition is that a <code>Functor</code> represents a “container” of some sort, along with the ability to apply a function uniformly to every element in the container. For example, a list is a container of elements, and we can apply a function to every element of a list, using <code>map</code>. As another example, a binary tree is also a container of elements, and it’s not hard to come up with a way to recursively apply a function to every element in a tree.</p>
<p>Another intuition is that a Functor represents some sort of “computational context”. This intuition is generally more useful, but is more difficult to explain, precisely because it is so general.</p>
<p>Quoted from <a href="https://wiki.haskell.org/Typeclassopedia#Functor">Typeclassopedia</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Basically, all instances of the <code>Functor</code> type class must provide a function <code>fmap</code>:</p>
<div id="cb6"><pre><code><span id="cb6-1"><span>class</span>  <span>Functor</span> f  <span>where</span></span>
<span id="cb6-2"><span>    fmap ::</span> (a <span>-&gt;</span> b) <span>-&gt;</span> f a <span>-&gt;</span> f b</span></code></pre></div>
<p>For Lists the implementation is simply the <code>map</code> function that we already have seen above:</p>
<div id="cb7"><pre><code><span id="cb7-1"><span>instance</span> <span>Functor</span> [] <span>where</span></span>
<span id="cb7-2">    <span>fmap</span> <span>=</span> <span>map</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>Functors have interesting properties, they fulfill the two so called <em>functor laws</em>, which are part of the definition of a mathematical functor:</p>
<div id="cb8"><pre><code><span id="cb8-1"><span>fmap</span> <span>id</span> <span>=</span> <span>id</span>                        <span>-- (1)</span></span>
<span id="cb8-2"><span>fmap</span> (g <span>.</span> h) <span>=</span> (<span>fmap</span> g) <span>.</span> (<span>fmap</span> h)  <span>-- (2)</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>The first law <code>(1)</code> states that mapping the identity function over every item in a container has no effect.</p>
<p>The second <code>(2)</code> says that mapping a composition of two functions over every item in a container is the same as first mapping one function, and then mapping the other.</p>
<p>These laws are very useful when we consider composing complex mappings from simpler operations.</p>
<p>Say we want to extend our DTO mapping functionality by also providing some kind of marshalling. For a single album instance, we can use function composition <code>(f . g) x == f (g x)</code>, which is defined in Haskell as:</p>
<div id="cb9"><pre><code><span id="cb9-1"><span>(.) ::</span> (b <span>-&gt;</span> c) <span>-&gt;</span> (a <span>-&gt;</span> b) <span>-&gt;</span> a <span>-&gt;</span> c</span>
<span id="cb9-2">(<span>.</span>) f g x <span>=</span> f (g x)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>In the following GHCi session we are using <code>(.)</code> to first convert an <code>Album</code> to its <code>AlbumDTO</code> representation and then turn that into a <code>String</code> by using the <code>show</code> function:</p>
<div id="cb10"><pre><code><span id="cb10-1">λ<span>&gt;</span> album1 <span>=</span> albums <span>!!</span> <span>0</span></span>
<span id="cb10-2">λ<span>&gt;</span> <span>print</span> album1</span>
<span id="cb10-3"><span>Album</span> {title <span>=</span> <span>"Microgravity"</span>, publishDate <span>=</span> <span>1991</span>, labelName <span>=</span> <span>"Origo Sound"</span>, artist <span>=</span> <span>Artist</span> {publicName <span>=</span> <span>"Biosphere"</span>, realName <span>=</span> <span>Just</span> <span>"Geir Jenssen"</span>}}</span>
<span id="cb10-4">λ<span>&gt;</span> marshalled <span>=</span> (<span>show</span> <span>.</span> toAlbumDTO) album1</span>
<span id="cb10-5">λ<span>&gt;</span> <span>:</span>t marshalled</span>
<span id="cb10-6"><span>marshalled ::</span> <span>String</span></span>
<span id="cb10-7">λ<span>&gt;</span> <span>print</span> marshalled</span>
<span id="cb10-8"><span>"AlbumDTO {albumTitle = \"Microgravity\", …</span></span></code></pre></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p><a href="https://share.descript.com/view/gVn4KDWrmsE">Listen to the audio version on Descript 🔉</a></p>

<p>It's been just over eight months since I left Nexmo/Vonage, where I'd been for over four years, and I'll admit to having spent a few hours reflecting upon my decision to leave. It's also that time of year when many people seem to get a new job and change companies so now seems like a good time to share some advice and some of my experiences.</p>

<p>When frustrated or tired of a job the most obvious reaction for many is to look for another job at another organisation. Sometimes a change in scenery can be what you need. The grass may be greener on the other side. But, there's also a chance it won't be and a move may not always be what you need. So, it's worth considering alternative options.</p>

<h2 id="take-a-break"><a href="#take-a-break">Take a Break</a></h2>

<p>Before you make any hasty decisions take some time off from your current role and try not to think about it. This will give your subconscious a chance to really process things. If you need an extended amount of time and if you've been at a company for a long time then a sabbatical may be an option. Failing that, and not everyone will be able to do this, you could consider some unpaid leave.</p>

<p>With your mind hopefully relaxed, and if you still feel like a change is required, it's time to consider your options.</p>

<h2 id="is-the-reason-for-moving-on-fundamental?"><a href="#is-the-reason-for-moving-on-fundamental?">Is the Reason for Moving on Fundamental?</a></h2>

<p>It's important to ask yourself if you're moving on for a <strong>fundamental</strong> reason. For example, do you dislike the company values, mission, goals or culture? These things are very difficult to change unless you are part of the company leadership team. Some teams within organisations can have their own culture, values and mission, and generally, be able to function independently. But, for a team to be successful within a business over a long period there has to be a reasonable alignment between a team and a company. So, unless you see positive leadership changes coming this is probably a scenario where the best thing is to move on.</p>

<p>If you're considering moving on for reasons other than a fundamental problem with the company you work for, there are alternatives. Which of these are available will depend on the company but they are worth exploring.</p>

<h2 id="try-a-different-role"><a href="#try-a-different-role">Try a Different Role</a></h2>

<p>If you have a reasonably broad range of skills, the company you work for requires some of your other skills, and another role available, trying that different role may be an option. Some companies may invest in retraining you so that you can take on that role.</p>

<p>For example, within <a href="https://www.leggetter.co.uk/2016/02/03/defining-developer-relations.html">Developer Relations</a> it may be possible to move from Developer Advocacy, where there's a requirement for a broad range of skills, to something more focused like Developer Education.</p>

<h2 id="propose-an-alternative-role"><a href="#propose-an-alternative-role">Propose an Alternative Role</a></h2>

<p>If there are things that you want to do that you're not presently getting to do why not see if you can create an alignment between the company, team and your goals?</p>

<p>Back in 2010 while working as an engineering team lead at Caplin Systems, I decided I wanted to focus on <a href="https://www.leggetter.co.uk/real-time-web-technologies-guide/">real-time web technologies</a>. I liked the people I worked with and the company I worked for was progressive and supportive. So, I spoke to the leadership team about my goals and we came up with the idea of putting our real-time technology in the cloud and making a <a href="https://www.programmableweb.com/api/kwwika">hosted service</a> available to developers. This created a new role for me and began my journey into Developer Relations.</p>

<h2 id="change-teams"><a href="#change-teams">Change Teams</a></h2>

<p>Can you change teams? This is likely only going to be an option at larger organisations where there are multiple teams with the same role. But moving teams, working with new people and taking on new challenges could be the change that you need.</p>

<h2 id="maybe-the-grass-will-be-greener"><a href="#maybe-the-grass-will-be-greener">Maybe the Grass Will be Greener</a></h2>

<p>Once you've considered all the alternatives you may decide it really is time to move on.</p>

<p>When I decided to move on from Nexmo/Vonage I was sure it was the right move but, over the past eight months, I have had the occasional moment where I wondered if I made a mistake. I'm very proud of the Platform &amp; Developer Experience team (including DevRel) we'd built at Nexmo/Vonage and many of the people in the wider organisation were nice.</p>

<p>However, upon reflection, I did make the right decision. For me it was fundamental: I felt that the company was going in the wrong direction from both a cultural and product perspective. I also looked at the VP (in all but title) job that - through the team's success - I’d ended up in and it was not the sort of role I wanted within Vonage at that time. So I discussed the situation with my colleagues, with leadership, wrote up a job spec for my successor and decided it was time to move on.</p>

<p>So, if you're reading this because you've been wondering if the grass will be greener, please do ensure you've considered all your options before making your decision. Whatever you decide, good luck! 🍀</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-block-type="2" id="block-932acedf8b238320f52f"><div><h3><strong>Prices reflect information</strong></h3><blockquote><p>“In a free market economic system, prices are knowledge, and the signals that communicate information. Prices are not simply a tool to allow capitalists to profit; they are the information system of economic production, communicating knowledge across the world and coordinating the complex processes of production.”</p><p>— Saifedean Ammous</p></blockquote><p>Prices are the coordinating force of a free market system. Each individual decision-maker can rely on the prices of goods and services to help with their decision making, as the prices themselves are a distillation of all known market information into a single metric. In other words, the compression of all relevant data is ultimately manifested as price (for the more technie minded, it’s a one-way hash function).</p><p>Each individual’s buy and sell decisions, in turn, further shape prices that carry this altered information back out into the market. Some of you may have heard of this from “Efficient market hypothesis” which is about how information in the market is reflected in the price of assets like equities.</p><h3><strong>Money is the measuring stick</strong></h3><blockquote><p>“Money is the central information utility of the world economy. As a medium of exchange, store of value, and unit of account, money is the critical vessel of information about the conditions of markets.” — George Gilder</p></blockquote><p>Capitalist economies are not equilibrium systems but dynamic domains of entrepreneurial experiments. Money should be a standard of measure for the outcomes of entrepreneurial experiments.</p><p>The essence of Capitalism is all about the efficient allocation of capital given the constraints of scarce resources and time. Companies are experiments on how to best allocate capital, and money is the standard measure for efficiency. Making money represents the efficient allocation of capital, losing money is not an efficient use of capital. And competition means decentralized planning by many separate companies and people to solve a problem in the market.</p><p>Capitalism, much like nature (evolution = random walk), is about experimentation.</p><h3><strong>Information is Decentralized</strong></h3><p>A centrally planned economy could never match the efficiency of the open market because what is known by a single agent is only a small fraction of the sum total of knowledge held by all members of society (Hayek’s “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_knowledge_problem">Local Knowledge Problem</a>”). A decentralized economy thus complements the dispersed nature of information spread throughout society. Each company is an attempt to take the local knowledge that it has and create a good or service that ultimately is the correct capital allocation (aka profit).</p><p>To highlight how decentralized this information is, I’m going to give an example by Milton Friedman who made the statement: “There’s not a single person in the world who knows how to make a pencil:</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p>The wood comes from a tree</p></li><li><p>To cut down that tree, it took a saw</p></li><li><p>To make the saw, it took steel. To make steel, it took iron ore</p></li><li><p>Graphite, comes from some mines in South America</p></li><li><p>The eraser, which is rubber, probably comes from the tropics</p></li><li><p>Or the yellow paint</p></li><li><p>Or the glue that holds it together</p></li></ul><p>There was no central planning office. It was the magic of the price system.”</p></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1610323211272_9027"><div><h3><strong>Central banks have an unsolvable data problem</strong></h3><p>Central banks inherently have a data problem. There’s an ingestion, processing, decision bottleneck — same as any electronic signal processing system. An economy cannot be planned by a central authority, because there is no way that a central authority can have all of the necessary knowledge to make the best decision at any single point in time, let alone all points in time.</p><blockquote><p>“It is a problem of the utilization of knowledge which is not given to anyone in its totality”</p><p>— Hayek</p></blockquote><p>To operate effectively, central banks would have to ingest trillions of data points daily, and ingest those data points in a perfect manner which is impossible. Every single uber taken, every single sandwich purchased, every single in-app purchase.</p><blockquote><p>“We need to believe we live in a predictable, controllable world, so we turn to authoritative-sounding people who promise to satisfy that need.” — Philip Tetlock</p></blockquote><p>We’ve created central banks because we want the world to make sense, and we want to feel that there is someone in charge. Even if we were able to ingest perfect data, it is hard to infer simple causality for this complex, chaotic system which involves billions of decision makers. While determining the relationship between weather and crops might seem easy, how do we determine the causality of burrito demand? Economics isn’t like the sciences, we are hamstrung by small or incomplete sample sizes. We can’t re-run the Dot com bubble with a different central bank or a different President.</p><p>This brings us to how central banks measure impact and make decisions. There is a classic product saying that goes “If you can’t measure it you can’t manage it.” It’s hard to even&nbsp;<a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/redefine-kilogram-180970798/" target="_blank">measure a kilogram</a>&nbsp;with extreme precision, so how could we possibly measure inflation properly? (ex: CPI excludes food and energy!)</p><p>Since big events come out of nowhere, forecasts may do more harm than good, giving the illusion of predictability in a world where unforeseen events control most outcomes (Aka black swan events). As Carl Richards says&nbsp;<em>“Risk is what’s left over when you think you’ve thought of everything.</em>” Daniel Kahneman also has a great take on the dangers of using history as our guide:</p><blockquote><p>“Hindsight, the ability to explain the past, gives us the illusion that the world is understandable. It gives us the illusion that the world makes sense, even when it doesn’t make sense. That’s a big deal in producing mistakes in many fields.”</p></blockquote><p>Here’s a useful analogy: Essentially the Fed is driving the car, which is the economy, only using the rearview mirror which is foggy, and the front windshield is opaque (you can’t see the future). How could the Fed possibly drive the car with any accuracy? What if we just let the car self adjust to the conditions of the road?</p><p>History cannot be interpreted without the aid of imagination and intuition. The sheer quantity of evidence is so overwhelming that selection is inevitable.</p><p>So what is our alternative?</p><h3><strong>Sound Money</strong></h3><blockquote><p>“Sound money is the equivalent of scientific integrity: the system must not permit the manipulation of data after the experiment has taken place.” — Adam Taché</p></blockquote><p>Sound money keeps the ruler settings fixed so results cannot be altered by a centralized planning mechanism.</p><p>And Bitcoin is the perfect iteration of sound money. Bitcoin has a hard cap for several reasons: being a precise measuring stick, reducing political attack vectors, and encouraging speculative bubbles which act as a viral loop.</p><p>But why 21M? Why not 100M?</p><p>It’s precise length is irrelevant. What matters is just that there is a fixed amount. As economic activity moves from a primitive scale, it becomes harder for individuals to make decisions without having a fixed unit of account with which to compare value.</p><p>Regarding political attack vectors, Satoshi felt that setting a “proper” rate of inflation rate was impossible so he decided to remove human decision making from the process. Satoshi has two quotes regarding fixed supply that support this conclusion:</p><blockquote><p>“Indeed there is nobody to act as central bank or federal reserve to adjust the money supply as the population of users grows. That would have required a trusted party to determine the value, because I don’t know a way for software to know the real world value of things.”</p></blockquote><p>Satoshi also says</p><blockquote><p>“If there was some clever way, or if we wanted to trust someone to actively manage the money supply to peg it to something, the rules could have been programmed for that.”</p></blockquote><p>Finally, Satoshi hypothesized that a fixed supply might create speculative bubbles.</p><p><em>“As the number of users grows, the value per coin increases. It has the potential for a positive feedback loop; as users increase, the value goes up, which could attract more users to take advantage of the increasing value.”</em></p><h3><strong>Implications of Sound Money</strong></h3></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1577480042477_7843"><div><p><br>Bitcoin is the ultimate safe haven asset. As more and more people buy into Bitcoin and that narrative, it becomes the de facto risk off asset.</p><p>Post hyperbitcoiniation, when Bitcoin is the SoV, MoE, and UoA, Bitcoin will reflect the most accurate “risk free” rate of return that we’ve ever had, which enables the economy and market participants to most efficiently allocate resources. Each market participant, both individual investors and corporations, make the risk on/risk off decision which is then manifested in Bitcoin’s price.</p><p>And finally, when Bitcoin is the unit of account and used by every business, market participants can view the flow of funds of their suppliers and customers in real time via their publicly disclosed Bitcoin addresses. This transparency makes markets ultra efficient through the best processing of information.</p><p>Bitcoin rearchitects how capital is efficiently allocated in our economy, ultimately creating a world with more abundance and resources for all.</p><p>The Bitcoin Times Ed 2 is the collaborative work of 8 writers &amp; 1 designer with the intent to educate, inspire and spread ideas on bitcoin.</p><p>Each section will be released on Medium as a free long form article, and the full, compiled version of the Bitcoin Times will be available for free at the link below. In 2020, we’ll release a limited edition hard cover collectible, for purchase, which you’ll be notified of by email if you download the free pdf.</p><p>If you found value in this or any of the other essays and articles, please support each of the contributors by sharing it out &amp; following their work.<br></p></div></div></div>]]>

Mutations in p53 are found in over 50% of human cancer, while EGCG is the major anti-oxidant in green tea, a popular beverage worldwide,” said <a href="https://href.li/?http://homepages.rpi.edu/~wangc5/index.html">Chunyu Wang</a>, corresponding author and a professor of biological sciences at <a href="https://href.li/?https://rpi.edu/">Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute</a>. “Now we find that there is a previously unknown, direct interaction between the two, which points to a new path for developing anti-cancer drugs. Our work helps to explain how EGCG is able to boost p53’s anti-cancer activity, opening the door to developing drugs with EGCG-like compounds.”</p><p>Wang, a member of the <a href="https://href.li/?https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hm_O0FqYSt4">Rensselaer Center for Biotechnology and Interdisciplinary Studies</a>, is an expert in using nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy to study <a href="https://href.li/?https://news.rpi.edu/content/2021/01/26/new-nih-grant-supports-single-molecule-study-protein-key-alzheimer-%E2%80%99s-disease">specific mechanisms in Alzheimer’s disease</a> and <a href="https://href.li/?https://news.rpi.edu/content/2017/02/27/hedgehog-cancer-and-zinc">cancer</a>, including p53, which he described as “arguably the most important protein in human cancer.”</p><p>P53 has several well-known anti-cancer functions, including halting cell growth to allow for DNA repair, activating DNA repair, and initiating programmed cell death — called apoptosis — if DNA damage cannot be repaired. One end of the protein, known as the N-terminal domain, has a flexible shape, and therefore, can potentially serve several functions depending on its interaction with multiple molecules.</p><p>EGCG is a natural antioxidant, which means it helps to undo the near constant damage caused during oxygen metabolism. Found in abundance in green tea, EGCG is also packaged as an herbal supplement.</p><p>Wang’s team found that the interaction between EGCG and p53 preserves the protein against degradation. Typically, after being produced within the body, p53 is quickly degraded when the N-terminal domain interacts with a protein called MDM2. This regular cycle of production and degradation holds p53 levels at a low constant.</p><p>“Both EGCG and MDM2 bind at the same place on p53, the N-terminal domain, so EGCG competes with MDM2,” said Wang. “When EGCG binds with p53, the protein is not being degraded through MDM2, so the level of p53 will increase with the direct interaction with EGCG, and that means there is more p53 for anti-cancer function. This is a very important interaction.”</p><p>“By developing an understanding of the molecular-level mechanisms that control key biochemical interactions linked to devastating illnesses such as cancer and Alzheimer’s disease, Chunyu’s research is laying the groundwork for new and successful therapies,” said Curt Breneman, dean of the Rensselaer School of Science.</p><p>–</p><p><b>Source:&nbsp;<a href="https://href.li/?https://news.rpi.edu/content/2021/02/12/green-tea-compound-aids-p53-guardian-genome-and-tumor-suppressor">Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute</a></b></p><p><b>Full study:</b>&nbsp;“EGCG binds intrinsically disordered N-terminal domain of p53 and disrupts p53-MDM2 interaction”, <i>Nature Communications</i>.</p><p><a href="https://href.li/?https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-021-21258-5">https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-021-21258-5</a><br></p><h2><b>Read Also</b></h2><p><a href="https://nuadox.com/post/625997758414929920/synthesizing-cepafungin">Chemists efficiently synthesize natural anti-cancer compound cepafungin I</a></p>

            <p>LOS ANGELES -- 
	Lucasfilm says Gina Carano is no longer a part of "The Mandalorian" cast after many online called for her firing over a social media post that likened the experience of Jews during the Holocaust to the U.S. political climate.</p>
<p>
	A spokesperson with the production company said in a statement on Wednesday that Carano is not currently employed by Lucasfilm with "no plans for her to be in the future."</p>
<p>
	"Nevertheless, her social media posts denigrating people based on their cultural and religious identities are abhorrent and unacceptable," the statement read.</p>
<p>
	Carano fell under heavy criticism after she posted that "Jews were beaten in the streets, not by Nazi soldiers but by their neighbours.... even by children."</p>
<p>
	The actor continued to say, "Because history is edited, most people today don't realize that to get to the point where Nazi soldiers could easily round up thousands of Jews, the government first made their own neighbours hate them simply for being Jews. How is that any different from hating someone for their political views?"</p>
<p>
	Carano, who played the recurring character Cara Dune on the "Star Wars" series, deleted the post but it was widely shared online and spurred the <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/FireGinaCarano?src=hashtag" target="_blank">#FireGinaCarano hashtag</a> to trend. Her character appeared in several episodes of the second season of "The Mandalorian," a series about a bounty hunter and his quest to unite a powerful, young user of the Force with a Jedi Knight.</p>
<p>
	Dune, who in the second season is a lawperson on a frontier planet, frequently teams up with the title character to fight an old nemesis: remnants of the evil Galactic Empire.</p>
<p>
	Carano, a former mixed martial artist whose Dune character used a mix of heavy weapons and her fists to best opponents, had been criticized for social media posts that mocked mask wearing during the pandemic and alleged voter fraud during the 2020 presidential election. She also mocked the use of gender pronouns, listing "beep/bop/boop" in her social media bio.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
				<!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>C++ language include an operator called <code>typeid</code> (<a href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/typeid">https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/typeid</a>).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Queries information of a type.<br>
Used where the dynamic type of a polymorphic object must be known and for static type identification.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It gives you information about the type of an object, as long as it's available.</p>
<pre><code>int a = 0;
std::string tname = typeid(a).name(); // tname == "i"
</code></pre>
<p>How it works?</p>
<h2 id="statictype">Static Type</h2>
<p>For static types, like the example above, compiler has all the information to know the evaluation result of <code>typeid(a)</code>. Let's take at look at the assembly.</p>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><figure><img src="https://blog.the-pans.com/content/images/2021/02/Screenshot-from-2021-02-13-10-14-57.png"></figure><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p><code>call 0x555555555160 &lt;_ZNKSt9type_info4nameEv&gt;</code> is where it calls the <code>name()</code> member function of the result <code>std::type_info</code> object from <code>typeid()</code> evaluation of the expression. We are interested in the <code>this</code> pointer and where the <code>std::type_info</code> object lives.</p>
<p><code>this</code> is stored in <code>%rdi</code> register before a member function call. It's coming from <code>%rax</code> which comes from a <code>%rip</code> relative address. Now we know the <code>type_info</code> object of interest lives at <code>0x7ffff7f827a0</code>, the program looks up the address by looking at what's stored in <code>[rip+0x2eal]</code>. <code>%rip</code> register stores the program counter (<code>$pc</code> in GDB). A process's virtual memory layout looks like</p>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><figure><img src="https://blog.the-pans.com/content/images/2021/02/memory-layout.png"><figcaption>(from https://www.thegeekstuff.com/2012/03/linux-processes-memory-layout/)</figcaption></figure><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>Program counter (<code>%rip</code>) should always be pointing at the TEXT section of the virtual memory of a running process. So in this case, adding an offset of <code>0x2eal</code>, it's now pointing at the section for storing global data.</p>
<p>To summarize, for static types, compiler has global variables (<code>std::type_info</code>) initialized. At places where the code calls <code>typeid</code>, the machine code just gets the corresponding <code>std::type_info</code> global objects that are already initialized. Done.</p>
<h2 id="dynamictype">Dynamic Type</h2>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><figure><img src="https://blog.the-pans.com/content/images/2021/02/Screenshot-from-2021-02-13-09-32-52.png"></figure><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>Here we have an example with dynamic types. Let's check the assembly.</p>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><figure><img src="https://blog.the-pans.com/content/images/2021/02/Screenshot-from-2021-02-13-10-14-12.png"></figure><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>Similarly, notice the call to <code>&lt;_ZnKSt9type_info4nameEv&gt;</code>. We are interested in where the assembly got <code>%rdi</code> (<code>this</code>) from.</p>
<p><code>%rbp</code> stores the stack base pointer. Accordingly to the calling convention, <code>[rbp-xxxx]</code> is how a machine gets locally variables for the current function frame. <code>[rbp-0x20]</code> must be getting the only locally variable (<code>foo</code> in this case).</p>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><figure><img src="https://blog.the-pans.com/content/images/2021/02/stackframe1.png"><figcaption>(from https://eli.thegreenplace.net/2011/02/04/where-the-top-of-the-stack-is-on-x86)</figcaption></figure><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>Notice <code>mov rcx, QWORD PTR [rcx]</code>. It took the first 8 byte of <code>foo</code>, and treated it as an address. It's the address to the vtable.</p>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><figure><img src="https://blog.the-pans.com/content/images/2021/02/Screenshot-from-2021-02-13-10-07-42.png"><figcaption>The first 8 byte of foo is the address to class Bar's vtable</figcaption></figure><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>Now <code>%rcx</code> is the address of Bar's vtable. <code>[rcx-0x8]</code> is how it got the address to the <code>std::type_info</code> that we are interested in. This is called RTTI (Runtime Type Information, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run-time_type_information">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run-time_type_information</a>). It's kept as a pointer to <code>std::type_info</code> in vtable. The overhead is minimum (no more expensive than an additional virtual method).</p>
<p>You can disable RTTI, and compiler will produce an error if you accidentally use RTTI in your code.</p>

And just like with physical fitness, metabolic fitness improves when we put in the effort.</p><p>Let’s take the analogy of starting a running program to improve our physical fitness in order to run a marathon. Our first jog isn’t going to be 26.2 miles; it’s likely going to be a short slog. But, as we lace up our shoes each day, hit the pavement, and track our progress over time, we see and feel progress. We notice small adaptations in our bodies: our breathing might get easier as we sprint up hills, our muscles become more defined, maybe our mood improves. We might track our mileage in Strava or our heart rate with a Fitbit and get excited as these metrics start to improve. As the weeks of running progress, it is clear that our physical fitness is improving.</p><p>On the flip side, if we decide to take a few months off from training, it’s likely that physical fitness will decline: those hard earned muscles may diminish, and we’d likely feel more winded the first time we get back out there.</p><p>The metabolism is no different. If we make daily choices that support metabolic processes, we will adapt to develop better metabolic fitness. We might not see our muscles grow, but inside our bodies, the microscopic machinery involved in converting fat and glucose to energy become more efficient. While becoming physically fit requires consistent exercise, becoming metabolically fit involves consistent smart decisions about diet (including what to eat, when to eat, and how to pair foods), sleep, stress management, physical activity, and exposure to metabolism-disrupting environmental toxins. Our current level of metabolic fitness is highly dynamic and largely in our control.</p><p>Just like we can track metrics of physical fitness to keep us informed, on-track, and motivated, we can also now track our metabolic fitness. Since glucose is the primary energy building block for our metabolism, tracking this biomarker with a continuous glucose monitor (CGM) can give us useful insight into our level of metabolic fitness.</p><p>With a CGM, we can see in real-time how our diet and lifestyle decisions are affecting our glucose levels, knowing that over time, stable and healthy glucose patterns lead to improved metabolic fitness. Using the insights from a CGM can help us modulate our food and lifestyle choices to accelerate metabolic progress.</p><p>And, just like with physical fitness, we can see meaningful improvements in our lives even if we haven’t won an Olympic gold metal. Fitness is a spectrum and each small amount of improvement is a win. As with most processes in the body, there is not an “on-off” switch for metabolic health. We are not either “healthy” or “unhealthy.” Rather, we are on a metabolic continuum, and our choices — coupled with our genes — determine where we stand each day.</p><h2>How does glucose fit in?</h2><p>Glucose is a simple sugar that is a breakdown product of the carbohydrates that we eat. When glucose enters the bloodstream, it signals to the pancreas to release insulin, a hormone that tells cells to absorb glucose. Some of this glucose is processed by the mitochondria to form energy (called ATP) that our cells can use. Excess glucose is stored in the muscle and liver as glycogen, and can also be <a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/11117-triglycerides">converted to triglycerides</a> and stored in fat cells.</p><p>When our bodies need energy, we can tap into glucose from the bloodstream, stored glycogen in the muscles or liver, or we can even make new glucose from other compounds like amino acids (breakdown products of proteins). Aside from using glucose for making energy, we can also break down stored fat to make energy, and convert protein breakdown products to energy.</p><p>However, when our bodies are taxed with processing too much dietary glucose over long periods of time, it throws off the balance of these processes, and leads to health problems. First, chronic excess glucose causes repeated release of insulin. High levels of insulin can, over time, cause cells to become “numb” to insulin’s effect, a process called <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6170977/"><em>insulin resistance</em></a>. When this happens, less glucose can get into the cells, so circulating glucose rises. Second, high insulin levels block stored fat from being broken down and used for energy. So, ironically, too much energy in the form of glucose leads us to have more trouble using energy effectively.</p><p>Aside from these issues, excess glucose in the bloodstream causes <a href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/full/10.1161/01.cir.0000034509.14906.ae">inflammation</a> (immune activation), <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23448484/">oxidative stress</a> (an overabundance of damaging free radicals in the body), and <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6200622/">glycation</a> (glucose getting “stuck” to things in the body and causing dysfunction).</p><p>Given how many deleterious effects excess glucose can have, it is not surprising that the majority of common chronic diseases are rooted in poor glucose control, including diabetes, obesity, heart disease, stroke, dementia, infertility, and more. This is a relatively modern phenomenon: we used to die of infectious disease and starvation. Now we die of metabolic related disease.</p><p>Why might that be? For starters, we (on average) eat nearly <a href="https://www.thediabetescouncil.com/45-alarming-statistics-on-americans-sugar-consumption-and-the-effects-of-sugar-on-americans-health/">10x more sugar per day than we did 100 years ago</a>. Many of us don’t even realize it, because sugar is so ubiquitous in our food culture, and it wears many masks (link: <a href="https://www.virtahealth.com/blog/names-for-sugar">56 names for sugar</a>). Imagine a factory getting 10x more shipments of raw material and trying to just “make it work.” It wouldn’t. The factory would fall apart. The machines would break. The workers would resist to protect themselves. This is what is happening to our bodies. Additionally, too much dietary fat can impair glucose processing; in fact, excess <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4587882/">saturated fat</a> impairs the function of the insulin receptor, leading to more circulating glucose.</p><p>In short, excess energetic precursors like glucose and fat gum up our bodies’ machinery, and are at the root of a vast amount of disease and suffering globally.</p><p>Currently, <a href="https://www.unc.edu/posts/2018/11/28/only-12-percent-of-american-adults-are-metabolically-healthy-carolina-study-finds/">only 12% of Americans are metabolically healthy</a>. The other 88% display one or more features that indicate that they have metabolic dysfunction and that their bodies are not able to utilize and process fat and carbohydrates efficiently. In this research study, to be considered “metabolically healthy,” you had to have normal blood glucose, triglycerides (a form of fat that is generated from excess glucose), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, blood pressure, and waist circumference, without the need for medications.</p><h2>The many faces of poor metabolic fitness</h2><p>What does metabolic dysfunction and poor metabolic fitness look like? It can be both overt and subtle.</p><p>Overtly, metabolic dysfunction looks like obesity (dysfunctional fat storage), insulin resistance and diabetes (dysfunctional glucose processing), non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (dysfunctional management of glucose and fat in the liver), cancer (cancer cells thrive on excess sugar), Alzheimer’s disease (now being called <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/researchers-link-alzheimers-gene-to-type-iii-diabetes/"><em>type 3 diabetes</em></a><em>,</em> with evidence of insulin resistance in the brain), cardiovascular diseases like heart attack and stroke (damage to vessels from inflammation and excess glucose), and chronic kidney disease (vessels of the kidney impaired by excess glucose).</p><p>But more subtly, lack of metabolic fitness can look like the full spectrum of daily pain points of modern living that keep us from reaching our full potential and goals: fatigue, brain fog, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6382695/">depres…</a></p></div></div></div></section></main></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-block-type="2" id="block-4b4cde9dbdbb9767ad24"><div><p>The 2020 pandemic exposed a fundamental flaw in the way the Internet is built.</p><p>Online games were blamed for clogged networks and slowed speeds, but in reality, the Internet is structurally broken when it comes to real-time interactivity. You’ve heard the line:</p><p><strong><em>Kids, get off your consoles; I’m on a video call!</em></strong></p><p>It’s 4 PM on Wednesday. You’re on an important Zoom call and right in the middle of presenting when your face freezes. Those on the call can only catch half of what you say and are left staring at an unflattering image of you mid-word.</p><h3><strong>How We Got Here: The Evolving Internet</strong></h3><p>The Internet is built for the reliable delivery of content, such as e-mail and file transfers, but not built for performance. Border Gateway Protocol (BGP)— the standardized routing protocol for the Internet—has no idea what traffic it is routing or in which direction it is sending data. It simply routes data using the cheapest path possible depending on various factors, including politics, commercial agreements, and cost. As a result, certain types of data, namely real-time communications, suffer as the Internet favors servicing volumetric traffic.</p><p>At the start of the millennium, content delivery networks employed global networks of servers to deliver static content faster, leading the way to make OTT (Over-the-top, services offered over the top of traditional content distributors) possible with the infrastructure built by companies such as Netflix, YouTube, and Akamai. More recently, companies like Amazon Web Services have democratized cloud computing, bringing connectivity to more users in more regions of the world. The next evolution of the Internet should be one in which the network itself is democratized, enabling speed-of-light communication for the applications that require high-velocity delivery, such as real-time communications. This means delivering voice over internet protocol calls (VoIP, e.g., Skype, Clubhouse), online multiplayer video games, and more, regardless of the compute or data server owner.</p><h3><strong>Complex Issues with a Complex Network</strong></h3><p>The Internet is a complicated web of networks and billions of computers and devices that connect to each other and work together to send and receive information. The greater the distance between the sending and receiving computers, the longer it takes the data to arrive at its destination. Information can also take different paths, which may increase or decrease the speed of delivery.</p><p>A common analogy used to explain the way the Internet works is the postal service. In the same way that your letter travels from you to the recipient through multiple facilities (carrier, sorting, post office), data travels through numerous routers on its way to the recipient computer. Just as your letter can arrive faster depending on which mail service you use, so too can data transmit faster depending on which path it takes, though the distance between the sender and receiver has the most influence on travel time.</p><p>There are a couple of significant differences in this analogy, however.</p><p><em>One, there are generally more “stops” along the way for data, and two, the data is broken up into multiple smaller “packets” of information rather than sent as one whole mail piece.</em></p><p>Because there are different paths along which individual packets of information can travel, each entailing a variable number of stops along the way, packets of data can easily get lost.</p><p><strong>Packet loss</strong>, as it’s called, results in missing information and a degraded user experience. In a Skype call, packet loss is experienced as gaps in audio. In video games, packet loss results in strange behavior like teleportation, in which a game freezes, then suddenly moves a player’s character to another place when the game resumes.</p><p>Another result of these inconsistent, differing routes is variation in delivery time. Some routes are faster than others, so some packets may arrive more quickly than others since the Internet is not conscious of which path it takes in sending data from one point to another. This variation in the time it takes for data to travel across the network from one endpoint to another is called <strong>latency</strong>, and the result of latency is <strong>jitter</strong>. On a Skype call, jitter manifests as jumbled speech that creates an indecipherable conversation. In video games, jitter manifests in behavior like errant shots, in which a player’s aim may be correct, but the shot doesn’t register in time to hit the target where they are.</p><p>While <strong>lag</strong> (high levels of latency), jitter, and packet loss may impact any online service or application, certain applications depend upon real-time packet delivery and minimal jitter and packet loss to function correctly and maintain a reasonable quality of experience. Packet delivery, consistent latency, and minimal lag are critical for services and applications like VoIP and online gaming and in numerous other industries such as high-frequency trading, telemedicine, and the Internet of Things.</p><p>For these applications, milliseconds saved in delivering data can lead to a real or virtual life-and-death situation and mean the difference between winning and losing millions of dollars or between a quality and a subpar gaming experience.</p><h3><strong>How Subspace Improves Real-Time Application Delivery</strong></h3><p>A millisecond’s delay in delivery does not matter in sending an email or a text message, but it does matter in real-time communications. So why should these applications travel on the same network, in the same way?</p><p>Subspace’s vision is to create an Internet byway through which latency-critical web traffic such as video games, VoIP, and video conferencing can consistently pass through at the speed of light. Like Waze for the Internet, Subspace gives the Internet a GPS of sorts, finding the absolute fastest and most secure and consistent path for real-time data to travel from endpoint to endpoint. As a result, latency and lag are reduced, and real-time applications reach their full potential.</p><p>While other companies have attempted to provide solutions for expediting real-time communications on the Internet, none have addressed the issue across the entire system. Many introduce other issues in their attempts. Commercial networking solutions like Cisco and Juniper were not built for global coordination or to understand and control game traffic. Standalone solutions that require SDKs installed in clients and servers can create significant security and stability risks. And services provided by CDNs like Cloudflare and Akamai utilize the same principles and infrastructure as their primary businesses—that is, volumetric traffic—making the possibility of optimizing real-time traffic at scale a costly and difficult endeavor.&nbsp;</p><p>In the case of video games, lag, packet loss, and jitter are such a concern that some game companies have endeavored to build their own custom solutions. This “do it yourself” approach requires massive internal coordination, investment, and attention, which many publishers cannot afford to prioritize. And still, a DIY approach limits the publisher to its existing commercial relationships and capabilities.</p><p>Subspace’s platform optimizes every component of network performance, from the infrastructure stack to the networking stack, including software and hardware, the control plane, and the data plane. With a global Internet architected specifically for real-time traffic at every point, we are achieving speed-of-light communication and democratizing the network. Regardless of the data’s location, Subspace uses a vast system of Internet quality metrics and a proprietary algorithm to direct real-time interactive traffic onto our platform and across the public and our private Internet to and from servers. The algorithm can balance multiple variables to suit each application’s needs—variables such as absolute latency, any latency above a threshold, jitter &amp; loss. The optimal delivery platform via the Subspace onramp drives better, more consistent experiences that match each application’s needs.</p></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1612978699676_35285"><div><p>We start with purpose-built points of presence (PoPs), deploying our hardware in data centers worldwide. Each PoP is capable of handling millions of servers, millions of simultaneous user sessions, and enough capacity for all of the user traffic while also providing room for absorbing DDOS attacks, with the expectation that traffic by its nature is mostly small UDP packets.</p><p>The PoPs are distributed globally and specifically network-engineered to reduce the distance needed for players to reach our onramp, minimizing the risk of congestion and misrouting. Players are given a Subspace IP and UDP port as a proxy for a server.</p><p>The Subspace PoP uses a proprietary algorithm to determine the optimal path through our private network before ultimately reaching the game server and back. We do this both ways, packets can take a different route back from the server if Subspace finds a better path for the application needs, another differentiator to CDNs, which are optimized for one-way traffic. Continuous telemetry measures the latency, jitter, and loss between Subspace PoPs, feeding into an algorithm that determines the optimum route between the edge and application servers. On the network’s server-side, we have PoPs directly connected with major providers to minimize latency and lag upon exiting our network.</p></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1612978699676_41155"><div><p>Subspace’s global network, which has already launched in multiple regions and is being aggressively deployed towards a global optimized network, already supports some of the world’s most popular online games. And it’s not just about performance. The Subspace platform leverages all of these PoPs to provide a tremendous platform for stopping DDoS attacks against application servers at the edge, before bot networks can aggregate into attacks that get too big to handle or have to be sent off to latency-inducing scrubbing centers. Troublesome attack vectors, replay attacks, and other volumetric attacks can be easily stopped at the Subspace edge, while the game server infrastructure remains protected …</p></div></div></div>

<article id="post-2982">

	

	
	<div>
		<p>This is a follow-up to my previous article about <a href="http://boginjr.com/it/hw/8inch-drives/">connecting old 8″ drives directly to a PC</a> equipped with a classic floppy disk controller. Since there is a way on how to do it on a hardware level without paid or proprietary equipment, there still needs to be a free and available software solution that enables the OS to interface these drives, as they were not officially supported on the PC during its entire history whatsoever. So, during my experiments, I’ve came up with one: <a href="http://boginjr.com/apps/8format/8format.zip">8FORMAT</a> – a small software bundle that’s also released <a href="https://github.com/climatex/8FORMAT" target="_blank" rel="noopener">open source</a>.</p>
<p>Since 8 inch drives are vintage and they predate the PC as we know it, my original intent was to experiment with these drives without relying on specialized equipment – an x86 PC with a vanilla floppy controller, with a makeshift cable and a power supply that feeds the drive, was aimed to be enough to make the drive operational. As such, to keep things simple, an OS was chosen that also runs on vintage equipment with no issues, and can provide down-to-the-bone hardware access without driver hassle. Yes, 8FORMAT is a DOS application. So, what does it do exactly?</p>
<p><a href="http://boginjr.com/wp-content/uploads/8format-1.png" data-rel="lightbox-gallery-QnAXb1b1" data-magnific_type="image" data-rl_title="8FORMAT, Command line arguments" data-rl_caption="" title="8FORMAT, Command line arguments"><img loading="lazy" src="http://boginjr.com/wp-content/uploads/8format-1.png" alt="" width="720" height="540" srcset="http://boginjr.com/wp-content/uploads/8format-1.png 720w, http://boginjr.com/wp-content/uploads/8format-1-300x225.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px"></a><strong>Available command-line arguments</strong></p>
<p>Like Dave Dunfield’s ImageDisk (IMD), 8FORMAT is also a multi-purpose DOS application that interfaces the floppy disk controller directly. However, 8FORMAT also tries to persuade the system BIOS to “accept” the drive, so that it can be used directly in DOS – or even Windows (up to 9x/ME). For this to work however, also a FAT filesystem needs to be created on the 8-inch disk, and no DOS utility, including IMD, would do that out of the box. So 8FORMAT was a product of my direct experimentation with these drives under the PC environment, with all of their quirks and pitfalls.<br>
The application has 2 main modes: <strong>formatting</strong> and <strong>using</strong> the disk. In the vanilla <strong>format</strong> mode, 8FORMAT will initialize and format the sectors with the chosen geometry or TYPE. A total of 5 pre-defined geometry types are provided, both the “historical” ones and the “extended”, or experimental ones, to be tried under DOS on an x86 PC. The format and read/write gaps between sectors are auto-set, but can be also tweaked. In addition to that, 8FORMAT can also try writing the DOS boot sector and filesystem, even on a non-512-byte-formatted disk (highly experimental), and it also supports custom floppy disk controllers given their base address, IRQ and DMA settings. Defaultly however, 8FORMAT will only format the disk, and won’t create any filesystems at all.<br>
In the <strong>use</strong> mode, 8FORMAT will install a resident “driver” that overrides the “Diskette Parameter Table” (DPT, INT 1eh) of the PC BIOS and the INT 13h “get drive type” and geometry calls, forcing any application or OS reliant on the BIOS to work with the 8″ drive, even if the physical sector size is non-standard. This includes most versions of DOS and early versions of Windows that were basically just improved DOS shells (1.01 to 4.x, i.e. 95, 98).<br>
However, due to limitations in the BIOS and how the DPT works, once the driver is installed resident, this 8-inch drive data is applied for all floppy drives – 5,25″ or 3,5″ drives will become non-operational and their system BIOS setting ignored. As such, the 8″ drive cannot coexist (properly) with other standard floppy drives in one machine, or on one floppy controller to be exact. And, for this very same reason, 8FORMAT shall only be launched from a hard drive/RAM drive or similar.<br>
The <strong>use mode</strong> can be either invoked by calling 8FORMAT with the <strong>/USE</strong> argument, to start using an 8-inch disk in the drive, and it is also asked at the end of a successful format operation.</p>

(invoking the /USE mode)<br>
</strong></p>
<p>The command-line arguments might seem a little intimidating, but are quite self-explanatory. One of the main arguments is specifying the TYPE, or geometry and density combo of the disk being formatted. This can be one of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>the <strong>DSSD</strong> type, which is a double-sided variant of the “historical” single-density format, with 128 byte sectors and 26 of them per track. Choosing this type requires a floppy controller that supports FM encoding at a 250 kbps data rate;</li>
<li>the <strong>DSDD</strong> type, which is – again – a historical format, yielding 8 sectors per track, 1024 bytes each, at a 500 kbps data rate.</li>
</ul>
<p>These two types were originally used in mainframe and “minicomputer” environments, running CP/M or similar. From the PC perspective, these have a non-standard physical sector size. Although 8FORMAT can make the BIOS recognize these formats, and even try writing a DOS filesystem on them; there are not many applications that use the BIOS disk calls with a physical sector size other than 512 bytes (see the “quirks” below).<br>
In addition to these two “historically standard” formats, there are three “extended” experimental formats that I have came up with, named EXT1 to EXT3:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <strong>EXT1</strong> type is a variant of the historic <strong>DSDD</strong> type, except that it uses 512 byte size per sector. So, instead of eight 1K sectors per track, there are sixteen 512B sectors per track; with the sector gaps reduced slightly to make them fit in a track proper. This type can essentially be called a “DOS-compatible DSDD”, and will safely occupy all the extents of a double-sided, double-density 8-inch floppy disk.</li>
<li>The <strong>EXT2</strong> type is a double-sided variant of the “SS/DD” diskettes that were used in Tandy TRS-80 Model II and similar rigs: 26 sectors per track, each sector with a size of 256 bytes.</li>
<li>And finally, the <strong>EXT3</strong> type, which 8FORMAT tries to access like if it was a DD 5,25″ 360K drive, just with 77 tracks instead of 40, i.e. nine 512-byte sectors per track.</li>
</ul>
<p>Of course, any of these types can be converted to single-side by specifying <strong>/1</strong> as an optional command line argument.<br>
It’s worth noting that only the two 512-byte-sectored formats, <strong>EXT1</strong> and <strong>EXT3</strong>, can be safely used directly under the DOS environment on a PC, because of details that follow below (especially in “Quirk #3”); on an x86 PC, the rest of the formats are for experimentation purposes, mostly when treated as logical formats with a 512-byte geometry (see “Quirk #10”).</p>

<p>Now, for all types <strong>except DSSD</strong> and <strong>EXT3</strong>, you will be needing a floppy disk controller that supports 500 kbps data transfers, i.e. one that is “high density capable” and can read and write 1,44MB 3,5″ (or 1,2MB 5,25″) disks without any issues.<br>
In addition to that, to experiment with type <strong>DSSD</strong>, the FDC as whole (not just the chip itself!), shall also support FM data transfers at a 250 kbps rate. And tell you what, <a href="https://services.theglitchworks.net/ng/testfdc_results" target="_blank" rel="noopener">not many floppy controllers can do that</a>.<br>
The <strong>EXT3</strong> is an exception, and is the only format that shall (technically) work with a vanilla DD PC floppy disk controller, i.e. the one that only goes with 5,25″ 360K or 3,5″ 720K drives. However, <a href="http://boginjr.com/it/hw/8inch-drives/">out of the three 8-inch drives mentioned in my parent article</a>, the FDCs that I tried were not able to find the address mark of any track formatted this way. In the end, I had to switch the 500kbps data rate manually on with the <strong>/500K</strong> argument, to force “high density” on something that was called “double density” on a much smaller floppy disk.&nbsp; So, an HD-capable PC FDC remains as a necessity for experimentation – but you might be luckier with the EXT3 and your drive 🙂<br>
As a side note, the EXT3 type worked well with a 5,25″ drive on a DD-only floppy controller – of course, only up to track 40. 🙂</p>

<p>The resident driver part (<strong>8TSR.EXE</strong> of the software bundle) is invoked by 8FORMAT after specifying the <strong>/USE</strong> argument, to start using the 8-inch disk in DOS, or directly after a successful format operation, shall the user press ENTER to reflect the new 8-inch geometry. 8FORMAT with /USE shall always be called before the very first 8-inch disk operation with BIOS or DOS, unless the disk was just formatted and ENTER pressed when asked to do so.<br>
This DOS TSR determines the location of the BIOS Diskette Parameter Table (DPT), copies it into a memory location it can write into (if necessary), instructs the BIOS to start using the new 8-inch drive parameters (due to platform limitations, for all floppy drives – sadly), hooks the INT 13h interrupt to start returning the new 8-inch geometry when asked by applications, and also hooks the timer interrupt, that tries to make sure nothing overrides the new 8-inch drive DPT. /NB: This is because in DOS real mode, memory access is unrestricted./<br>
Afterwards, the 8-inch drive can usually be accessed with normal DOS commands, to copy new files, move the other, run applications etc. But, using “specialized” tools that don’t even have the slighest idea about what kind of drive is present in the system (vanilla FORMAT, DISKCOPY, various disk doctors and whatnot) can corrupt the data written on the disk. Remember, 8″ drives were not supported on the PC at all – and the 8FORMAT/8TSR is a hack 🙂</p>

<p>The last application of the software bundle is <strong>TESTREAD.COM</strong>. This is a small DOS application that invokes BIOS INT 13h services /the same ones that DOS uses/ to verify reading a couple of sectors off the specified floppy drive, of what size the sectors are, and dumping them to disk. This can be used, for example, together with 8FORMAT /USE to proof-read whether the actual BIOS can read a non-512-byte-sector floppy, even though 99.9% of applications using BIOS calls WILL expect that the PC BIOS always returns a 512 byte floppy buffer. See the “Quirks” below.</p>

								<h2>Intro</h2>

								<p>This book provides a comprehensive introduction to optimization with a focus on practical algorithms. The book approaches optimization from an engineering perspective, where the objective is to design a system that optimizes a set of metrics subject to constraints. Readers will learn about computational approaches for a range of challenges, including searching high-dimensional spaces, handling problems where there are multiple competing objectives, and accommodating uncertainty in the metrics. Figures, examples, and exercises convey the intuition behind the mathematical approaches. The text provides concrete implementations in the Julia programming language. Topics covered include derivatives and their generalization to multiple dimensions; local descent and first- and second-order methods that inform local descent; stochastic methods, which introduce randomness into the optimization process; linear constrained optimization, when both the objective function and the constraints are linear; surrogate models, probabilistic surrogate models, and using probabilistic surrogate models to guide optimization; optimization under uncertainty; uncertainty propagation; expression optimization; and multidisciplinary design optimization. Appendixes offer an introduction to the Julia language, test functions for evaluating algorithm performance, and mathematical concepts used in the derivation and analysis of the optimization methods discussed in the text. The book can be used by advanced undergraduates and graduate students in mathematics, statistics, computer science, any engineering field, (including electrical engineering and aerospace engineering), and operations research, and as a reference for professionals.</p>

The answer is no.</p><p>We can set the name property on an input field and access it from the event handler. This value allows us to use a single input handler for <code>onChange</code> events. </p><p>Here’s your current situation when using a not-optimized form with two input fields.

In other words, we can write better readable code that’s also much easier to maintain.</p><p>For this, we’ll be using the <code>useState</code> hook. For those that are not aware of what a hook is and why you would use it. Here’s a short definition from the <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-state.html#whats-a-hook" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">React documentation</a>.</p><blockquote><p><strong>What is a Hook?</strong> A Hook is a special function that lets you “hook into” React features. For example, useState is a Hook that lets you add React state to function components.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p><strong>When would I use a Hook?</strong> If you write a function component and realize you need to add some state to it, previously you had to convert it to a class. Now you can use a Hook inside the existing function component.</p></blockquote><p>First, let’s take a look at how we update the state using the <code>setState</code> hook.</p><div><pre><p><span>1</span><span>this</span><span>.</span><span>setState</span><span>(</span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>2</span><span>    errorMsg</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>""</span><span>,</span><span></span></p><p><span>3</span><span>    items</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>[</span><span>item1</span><span>,</span><span> item2</span><span>]</span><span></span></p><p><span>4</span><span></span><span>}</span><span>)</span><span>;</span></p></pre></div><p>Now, let’s make use of the <code>useState</code> hook. We need to import this hook from the <code>react</code> library. We can now declare new state variables and pass them an initial value. We’ll use destructuring to get a variable for retrieving the value and one for setting the value (this one is a function). Let’s take a look at how we can do this for the above example.</p><div><pre><p><span>1</span><span>import</span><span> </span><span>React</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span> useState </span><span>}</span><span> </span><span>from</span><span> </span><span>"react"</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>2</span><span></span></p><p><span>3</span><span></span><span>const</span><span> </span><span>App</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>4</span><span>  </span><span>const</span><span> </span><span>[</span><span>items</span><span>,</span><span> setIems</span><span>]</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>useState</span><span>(</span><span>[</span><span>]</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>5</span><span>  </span><span>const</span><span> </span><span>[</span><span>errorMsg</span><span>,</span><span> setErrorMsg</span><span>]</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>useState</span><span>(</span><span>""</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>6</span><span></span><span>}</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>7</span><span></span></p><p><span>8</span><span></span><span>export</span><span> </span><span>default</span><span> </span><span>App</span><span>;</span></p></pre></div><p>Now, you can directly access both constants <code>items</code> and <code>errorMsg</code> in your component.</p><p>Further, we can update the state inside a function like this:</p><div><pre><p><span>1</span><span>import</span><span> </span><span>React</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span> useState </span><span>}</span><span> </span><span>from</span><span> </span><span>"react"</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>2</span><span></span></p><p><span>3</span><span></span><span>const</span><span> </span><span>App</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>4</span><span>  </span><span>const</span><span> </span><span>[</span><span>items</span><span>,</span><span> setIems</span><span>]</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>useState</span><span>(</span><span>[</span><span>]</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>5</span><span>  </span><span>const</span><span> </span><span>[</span><span>errorMsg</span><span>,</span><span> setErrorMsg</span><span>]</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>useState</span><span>(</span><span>""</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>6</span><span></span></p><p><span>7</span><span>  </span><span>return</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span></span></p><p><span>8</span><span>    </span><span>&lt;</span><span>form</span><span>&gt;</span><span></span></p><p><span>9</span><span>        </span><span>&lt;</span><span>button onClick</span><span>=</span><span>{</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> </span><span>setItems</span><span>(</span><span>[</span><span>"item A"</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>"item B"</span><span>]</span><span>)</span><span>}</span><span>&gt;</span><span></span></p><p><span>10</span><span>          </span><span>Set</span><span> items</span></p><p><span>11</span><span>        </span><span>&lt;</span><span>/</span><span>button</span><span>&gt;</span><span></span></p><p><span>12</span><span>    </span><span>&lt;</span><span>/</span><span>form</span><span>&gt;</span><span></span></p><p><span>13</span><span>  </span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>14</span><span></span><span>}</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>15</span><span></span></p><p><span>16</span><span></span><span>export</span><span> </span><span>default</span><span> </span><span>App</span><span>;</span></p></pre></div><p>That’s how you can use state hooks.</p><h2 id="4-cache-expensive-operations-with-usememo">#4: Cache expensive operations with useMemo</h2><p>Memoization is an optimization technique to store the result of expensive operations. In other words, a sorting operation is often an expensive operation that requires a lot of processing. We don’t want to execute this expensive function for every page render.</p><p>Therefore, we can use the <code>useMemo</code> hook to remember the output when you pass the same parameters to the <a href="https://rossbulat.medium.com/how-to-memoize-in-react-3d20cbcd2b6e" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">memoized function</a>. The <code>useMemo</code> hook accepts a function and the input parameters to remember. React refers to this as a dependencies array. Every value referenced inside the function should also appear in your dependencies array.</p><p>Here’s a simple, abstract example. We pass two parameters <code>a</code> and <code>b</code> to an expensive function. As the function uses both parameters, we’ve to add them to the dependencies array for our <code>useMemo</code> hook.</p><div><pre><p><span>1</span><span>const</span><span> memoizedValue </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>useMemo</span><span>(</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> </span><span>computeExpensiveValue</span><span>(</span><span>a</span><span>,</span><span> b</span><span>)</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>[</span><span>a</span><span>,</span><span> b</span><span>]</span><span>)</span><span>;</span></p></pre></div><h2 id="5-decouple-functions-into-pure-functions-to-improve-code-quality">#5: Decouple functions into pure functions to improve code quality</h2><p>As a general React best practice, you should decouple functions that don’t rely on your component. In other words, a function that doesn’t rely on any state or React hooks.</p><p>Therefore, a sorting function is an excellent example of a function that you can extract as a pure function. </p><p>You might wonder why you should embrace functional programming? </p><blockquote><p>Functional programming is the process of building software by composing pure functions, avoiding shared state, mutable data, and side-effects. Pure function are better readable and easier to test. Therefore, they improve code quality. - <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/intro-to-functional-programming-basics/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">freeCodeCamp</a></p></blockquote><p>Now, let’s apply this concept to React components. Here’s a function that can sit both inside a React component or outside. Both are comparison functions, which you can pass to an expensive sorting function, that accept two input parameters. As there’s no interaction with the state, we can extract both functions to pure functions. This allows us to place the pure functions in a separate file and import them in multiple locations if needed.</p><div><pre><p><span>1</span><span>function</span><span> </span><span>ascSort</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>a</span><span>,</span><span> b</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>2</span><span>  </span><span>return</span><span> a </span><span>&lt;</span><span> b </span><span>?</span><span> </span><span>-</span><span>1</span><span> </span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>b </span><span>&gt;</span><span> a </span><span>?</span><span> </span><span>1</span><span> </span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>0</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>3</span><span></span><span>}</span><span></span></p><p><span>4</span><span></span></p><p><span>5</span><span></span><span>function</span><span> </span><span>descSort</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>a</span><span>,</span><span> b</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>6</span><span>  </span><span>return</span><span> b </span><span>&lt;</span><span> a </span><span>?</span><span> </span><span>-</span><span>1</span><span> </span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>a </span><span>&gt;</span><span> b </span><span>?</span><span> </span><span>1</span><span> </span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>0</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>7</span><span></span><span>}</span></p></pre></div><h2 id="6-create-custom-react-hooks">#6: Create custom React hooks</h2><p>We’ve learned how to use the <code>useState</code> and <code>useMemo</code> React hooks. Yet, React allows you to define your own React hooks to extract logic and make components more readable. </p><p>We can specify custom React hooks starting with the <code>use</code> keyword, like all other React hooks. It’s beneficial when you want to share logic between different functions. Instead of copying the function, we can define the logic as a React hook and reuse it in other functions.</p><p>Here’s an example of a React component that updates the state when the screen size gets reduced to below 600 pixels.

<p>Taking a glance at the weather when leaving your cozy bunker is a very useful thing. It allows you to prepare for the ever-changing conditions and select protective gear according to the situation. You definitely need one!</p>

<p>To achieve that, of course, you can use your portable computing device (aka smartphone). But trust me, it is much more convenient when a nifty screen describing current and predicted weather condition resides on a shelf near the exit airlock. </p>

<p>As information is rarely updated, the natural choice for display is e-ink technology. A lot of engineers are using Raspberry Pi to drive it. But even Pi Zero is too much overhead for the simple task of downloading JSON file and presenting it on the screen (and I'm not even speaking about bringing node.js to the equation). It is like using a sixteen wheeler for door-to-door pizza delivery.</p>

<p>Much more suitable for the job is ESP32 system-on-a-chip. Recently I've discovered awesome boards from <a href="http://www.lilygo.cn/prod_view.aspx?TypeId=50031&amp;Id=1148&amp;FId=t3:50031:3">LilyGO</a>. It has an 2.7" white/black/red e-ink display and wifi/bluetooth. Boards are programmable from Arduino IDE without shady software. Could be powered from literary everything: power bank, battery salvaged from your old mp3 player, LIR2450 coin cell battery... As it refreshes once in an hour you will get months of runtime - so combined with wifi - no wires on your shelf. Also, it has an sd card reader, 4 programmable buttons and pins for the speaker and microphone, in case you want some extra functionality.</p>

<p>Board comes assembled, with an e-ink display. From your side, you only need to connect to <a href="https://gist.github.com/dmi3/26d3924f5b4600e5dc5197d1c3da7f43#user-content-battery">power source</a> (connector included, just connect wires together) and upload some software. LilyGO will take care of charging your battery (up to 500mA). See:</p>

<p><a href="https://gist.github.com/dmi3/26d3924f5b4600e5dc5197d1c3da7f43#weather-gadget">→ Bill of materials</a></p>

<p>Uploading software is easy. Just connect the board to a USB port and upload via Arduino IDE (no need to flash sd card). There is a lot of weather display code in the web. I've <a href="https://github.com/dmi3/weather">modified one of examples a bit</a> to show data useful to me.  See setup instructions and troubleshooting on <a href="https://github.com/dmi3/weather#readme">GitHub</a>. In my case display looks like this:</p>

<div>
            <p><a href="#weather3_preview">
              <img src="https://developer.run/pic/weather3-300x.png" alt="Weather Gadget Thumbnail">
            </a></p><p>Weather Gadget</p>
        </div>
        <p><a href="#_" id="weather3_preview">
          <img src="https://developer.run/pic/weather3.jpeg" alt="Weather Gadget">
        </a></p>

<ol>
<li>Red Alerts for the weather if any</li>
<li>Current temperature (and "feels like" temperature)</li>
<li>Humidity and wind</li>
<li>Temperature graph in next 24 hours</li>
<li>Probability of precipitation in next 24 hours</li>
</ol>

<p>The software connects to your wifi, downloads the latest data from <a href="https://openweathermap.org/">OpenWeather API</a>, redraws the e-ink display, then goes to sleep for 30 minutes. I've also added ping to <a href="https://healthchecks.io/">Healthchecks.io</a>. If the board will not ping it for some time (because of a dead battery or software error), I will get a notification to my email from Healthchecks.io.</p>

<p><a name="github" href="https://github.com/dmi3/weather">Source on Github</a></p>

<p>Of course, you can put the board in some photo frame as people usually tend to do. But for me, the current aesthetic looks cool. Also, the weather is just one of the examples of what you can do with this awesome board. See <a href="https://github.com/Xinyuan-LilyGO/LilyGo-T5-Epaper-Series">more examples</a>.</p>

February 13, 2021 | https://liftm.io/posts/cursed-curried-elixir.html | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://liftm.io/posts/cursed-curried-elixir.html">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
      
        <time datetime="2021-02-13">2021-02-13</time>
      <p>In <a href="https://liftm.io/posts/curried-elixir.html">Curried Elixir</a>, I said this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We're going to do this by wrapping <code>my_fun</code> in a chain of anonymous functions, each binding exactly one name:</p>
<pre><code>curried_fun =
  fn (a) -&gt;
    fn (b) -&gt;
      fn (c) -&gt;
        my_fun.(a, b, c)
      end
    end
  end
</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<p>And then went on implementing <code>curry</code> as a recursive function. But what if I actually want my curried function to be a chain of anonymous functions, and get rid of this recursive call?</p>
<p>The obvious thing to do would be to try to implement this as a macro instead. But I think we can do better than this.</p>
<p>First, let's look at the <a href="https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/syntax-reference.html#the-elixir-ast">AST</a> for the <code>curried_fun</code> above:</p>
<pre><code>iex&gt; quote do
...&gt;   fn (a) -&gt;
...&gt;     fn (b) -&gt;
...&gt;       fn (c) -&gt;
...&gt;         my_fun.(a, b, c)
...&gt;       end
...&gt;     end
...&gt;   end
...&gt; end
#                ▼ metadata                ▼ nested anonymous function
{:fn, [], [{:-&gt;, [], [[{:a, [], Elixir}], {:fn, [], [{:-&gt;, ...}]}]}]}
#                      ▲ list of parameters
</code></pre>
<p>This might look a bit messy, but there really isn't much going on:</p>
<pre><code>{:fn, [], # The definition with an empty list of metadata
 [
   {:-&gt;, [],
    [
      [{:a, [], Elixir}], # Left-hand side of `-&gt;`, the head of the anonymous function
      {:fn , [], # Right-hand side of `-&gt;`, the body of the anonymous function
       ...
</code></pre>
<h2>Building the AST</h2>
<p>Just to get started, let's see if we can write a function that generates this AST for us.
We want this function to take as arguments the length of the chain and the body of the innermost function in the chain:</p>
<pre><code>def make_chain(length_, body) do
  Enum.reduce(1..length_, body, fn x, acc -&gt;
    {:fn, [], [{:-&gt;, [], [[{:"arg#{x}", [], nil}], acc]}]}
  end)
end
</code></pre>
<p>Or better, use <a href="https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/Macro.html#generate_unique_arguments/2"><code>Macro.generate_unique_arguments/2</code></a> to generate the list of parameters for us:</p>
<pre><code>defmodule Func do
  def make_chain(length_, body) do
    length_
    |&gt; Macro.generate_unique_arguments(nil)
    |&gt; Enum.reverse() # Without this, the outermost function would get the last argument, which could make things confusing
    |&gt; Enum.reduce(body, fn arg, acc -&gt;
      {:fn, [], [{:-&gt;, [], [[arg], acc]}]}
    end)
  end
end
</code></pre>
<p>We can use <a href="https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/Macro.html#to_string/2"><code>Macro.to_string/1</code></a> to check if this works as expected:</p>
<pre><code>iex&gt; Macro.to_string(make_chain(2, "Foo"))
"fn arg1 -&gt; fn arg2 -&gt; \"Foo\" end end"
</code></pre>
<p>Perfect! 🎉</p>
<p>We have one thing left to do before we can start rewriting <code>curry</code>: we need to generate the AST to call <code>fun</code>. This is actually pretty easy:</p>
<pre><code>iex&gt; quote do: fun.(a, b)
{{:., [], [{:fun, [], Elixir}]}, [], [{:a, [], Elixir}, {:b, [], Elixir}]}
</code></pre>
<p>All we need is <a href="https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/Macro.html#generate_unique_arguments/2"><code>Macro.generate_unique_arguments/2</code></a> and <a href="https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/master/Function.html#info/2"><code>Function.info/2</code></a> to get the arity of <code>fun</code>:</p>
<pre><code>iex&gt; fun = &amp;Map.get/2
iex&gt; {:arity, arity} = Function.info(fun, :arity)
iex&gt; params = Macro.generate_unique_arguments(arity, nil)
iex&gt; Macro.to_string({{:., [], [{:fun, [], nil}]}, [], params})
"fun.(arg1, arg2)"
</code></pre>
<h2>Evaluating the AST</h2>
<p>We now know how to generate the AST for our curried function. For the next step, we need to figure out how to use it!</p>
<p>If you're scared of <a href="https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/Kernel.html#defmacro/2"><code>defmacro/2</code></a> and <a href="https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/Kernel.SpecialForms.html#unquote/1"><code>unquote/1</code></a>, don't worry. We don't need any of that. Everyone knows macros are scary.</p>
<p>You know what's not scary? <em>Runtime evaluation!</em></p>
<p>With <a href="https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/Code.html#eval_quoted/3"><code>Code.eval_quoted/2</code></a>, we should finally be able to write our <code>curry</code> function:</p>
<pre><code>defmodule Func do
  def curry(fun) do
    {:arity, arity} = Function.info(fun, :arity)
    params = Macro.generate_unique_arguments(arity, nil)
    body_ast = {{:., [], [{:fun, [], nil}]}, [], params}

    {curried_fun, _} =
      params
      |&gt; Enum.reverse()
      |&gt; Enum.reduce(body_ast, fn arg, acc -&gt;
        {:fn, [], [{:-&gt;, [], [[arg], acc]}]}
      end)
      |&gt; Code.eval_quoted(fun: fun)

    curried_fun
  end
end
</code></pre>
<p>Does it work?</p>
<pre><code>iex&gt; curried_sum = Func.curry(fn x, y -&gt; x + y end)
#Function&lt;...&gt;
iex&gt; curried_sum.(1).(2)
3
iex&gt; Func.curry(&amp;Map.get/2).(%{foo: "bar"}).(:foo)
"bar"
</code></pre>
<p>It does! 🎉
Who needs macros??</p>

    <p>Someone asked me about this very recently so I felt it
    was worth writing out my thoughts in more detail. Note that
    this isn’t a manifesto, or a declaration, its just an
    effort to start putting some structure on my thoughts.</p>

    <h2 id="thehistory">The History</h2>

    <p>Since Richard Stallman wrote his GNU Manifesto<a href="#fn:1" id="fnref:1" title="see footnote" name="fnref:1">[1]</a> in the mid–1980s, it has come to
    be regarded as the ur-text of Free and Open Software. The
    principles enunciated were later expanded upon and codified in
    the Free Software Definition<a href="#fn:2" id="fnref:2" title="see footnote" name="fnref:2">[2]</a>, and
    have been adopted, to varying degrees, by different
    organisations, like Debian’s Free Software
    Guidelines<a href="#fn:3" id="fnref:3" title="see footnote" name="fnref:3">[3]</a> and the OSI’s
    Open Source Definition<a href="#fn:4" id="fnref:4" title="see footnote" name="fnref:4">[4]</a>. Before
    I continue, its probably a good idea to restate the “Four
    Freedoms” of the FSD:-</p>

    <ol>
      <li>The freedom to run the program as you wish, for any
      purpose</li>

      <li>The freedom to study how the program works, and change it
      so it does your computing as you wish. Access to the source
      code is a precondition for this.</li>

      <li>The freedom to redistribute copies so you can help your
      neighbor.</li>

      <li>The freedom to distribute copies of your modified
      versions to others. By doing this you can give the whole
      community a chance to benefit from your changes. Access to
      the source code is a precondition for this.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>While these are each expressed as <em>positive</em>
    freedoms, when the Four Freedoms (I’ll refer to these as
    4F from here, and call the individual Freedoms by number, e.g.
    4F0) were adopted by Debian and OSI, there was a distinct shift
    from positive freedoms to <em>restrictive</em> freedoms - most
    particularly the requirements that the software license:-</p>

    <dl>
      <dt><em>No Discrimination Against Fields of
      Endeavor</em></dt>

      <dd>The license must not restrict anyone from making use of
      the program in a specific field of endeavor. For example, it
      may not restrict the program from being used in a business,
      or from being used for genetic research.</dd>

      <dt><em>Distribution of License</em></dt>

      <dd>The rights attached to the program must apply to all to
      whom the program is redistributed without the need for
      execution of an additional license by those parties.</dd>
    </dl>

    <h2 id="theoriginalsins">The Original Sins</h2>

    <p>There are two separate, albeit related, problems which
    underlie these apparently positive definitions: Individualism
    &amp; Capitalism.</p>

    <p>In each case, be it the 4F, DSG or the OSI, all positive
    rights are expressed purely in <em>individual</em> terms. There
    are no collective rights in these documents, just individual
    rights. The ideal of the developer as an individual is
    hard-coded into the DNA of the Free Software Movement and its
    various children.</p>

    <p>There are various reasons for this; Stallman’s
    original tracts, for example, idealise his struggles with the
    collapse of the “social club” of MIT’s AI Lab
    and emphasise his private struggles against the loss of his
    community, these experiences are the cornerstone of his
    personal identity. Bruce Perens, father of the Debian Project,
    holds to the peculiar American cult of the Individualist
    Libertarian, as does Eric Raymond, the programmer/chronicler
    who devised the Open Source concept with Perens in the late
    1990s - free software without the freedom.</p>

    <p>It is important to remember that the American version of
    Libertarianism, as espoused by Ayn Rand and her ideologues, is
    nothing to do with the Franco-European tradition of
    libertarianism, a spectrum of leftist anarchism running from
    Babeuf through Déjacque to Faure. American
    Libertarianism should more accurately be described as
    “anarchist-capitalism”, a strain of
    pseudo-political thought which idolises the popular concept of
    the Old West as a high-point of western civilisation, when men
    were men and justice as dispensed from the barrel of a gun.</p>

    <p>It is notable that the sole non-individual right enunciated
    in the DSG and the OSD is that of the
    <strong>corporation</strong>. Perens and Raymond were certainly
    motivated by the tenets of capitalism, the primary purpose of
    their “Open Source Definition” was the packaging up
    of “Free Software” to make it acceptable to
    capitalists and rent-seekers of every stripe. Their
    collaborators in this, most notably Brian Behlensdorf and Larry
    Augustin, later seamlessly transitioned to the burgeoning
    Venture Capitalist industry.</p>

    <p>Be it as a result of accident, as with Stallman, or of
    design, as with Perens/Raymond <em>et al</em>, these designers
    of the “Holy Texts” of Free and Open Software
    applied no value to the concepts of Community and Commons.</p>

    <p>To look again at 4F3 &amp; 4F4, the Freedoms described are
    explicitly the Freedom for the Individual Programmer to decide
    whether to share his value-added programs with his community.
    More than that, in his detailed expansion on the Freedoms,
    Stallman is at pains to explain that his Freedoms do not
    enforce any <em>obligation</em> upon the Individual Programmer
    to release <em>his</em> works. In fact, in his expanded notes,
    Stallman entitles 4F3 <em>“The freedom to redistribute,
    <strong>if you wish</strong>”</em>:-</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>You should also have the freedom to make modifications and use them
privately in your own work or play, without even mentioning that they exist. If
you do publish your changes, you should not be required to notify anyone in
particular, or in any particular way.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>Again, the entire emphasis of Stallman’s concept of
    Freedom rests on the specific rights of the Individual.
    Stallman, moreover, is the “hardcore” of this
    movement, the supposedly non-commercial member of the group.
    The emphasis placed here on the right to not distribute if you
    wish may seem trivial, however, it is central to the overall
    failure of Free and Open Source Software.</p>

    <h2 id="theresultingproblems">The Resulting Problems</h2>

    <p>Today, some 35 years after Stallman’s 4Fs, we can see
    that Free and Open Source Software is, in almost all
    conceivable ways, triumphant. It has won its struggles against
    Microsoft, it is the core of almost all smartphones, it lies at
    the heart of the networked world we all inhabit.</p>

    <p>Amidst all this glory, however, there is something utterly
    broken about the FOSS world. In short, it is one-sided, devoid
    of economic rights, and an active agent in the oppression of us
    all.</p>

    <p>As a result of the underlying assumptions and conceptions of
    the FOSS movement, there is no methodology to <em>require</em>
    the sharing of changes and improvments with the commons. The
    entire focus of the FOSS movement is specifically geared
    towards individual rights, the focus of the Open-Source
    movement is on ensuring that coporations can freely take the
    product of individual labour and profit from it.</p>

    <p>Because of Stallman’s original sin, there is no
    accepted structure within the FOSS world wherein such
    obligation to share changes can be enforced by the originator
    of a piece of software. The DSG, in fact, specifically requires
    this as a <em>precondition</em> for inclusion in its
    repositories.</p>

    <p>This means that improvements in software, bug-fixes,
    security-patches and the like, remain the absolute property of
    the person who has made them, despite the fact that they are,
    in Newton’s words, <em>“standing on the
    shoulders”</em> of those who came before. The originator
    of the software, in other words, is someone who can count
    herself lucky to be afforded the “exposure” which
    may come from the future sale of her works by a more powerful
    entity. The entire function of FOSS is for developers to
    provide the fruits of their labour, either without recompense
    or for fractional recompense, to others.</p>

    <p>The individual programmer has the rights afforded them by
    the 4Fs and the OSD, but those rights are inherently solitary.
    What possibility can there be to enforce those rights, limited
    as they may be, against the powerhouses of our gilded age? What
    economic rights accrue to our developers, the people who, in
    Stallman’s conception, are the origin point of the FOSS
    movement?</p>

    <p>Two recent and pertinent examples can be examined to provide
    answers: Heartbleed, the security vulnerability in the OpenSSL
    Library; and GitHub.</p>

    <p>OpenSSL, a software library used to secure communications
    against eavesdropping, was (until Heartbleed) primarily written
    by one person, Stephen Henson. The OpenSSL Foundation, who
    employed him, had never had more than $1m in annual funding,
    and this funding was obtained almost exclusively through
    third-party contract work which focused on specific deliverable
    product, <strong>not</strong> on the <em>“fundamental
    maintenance and development activities like releases
    management, code review and refactoring, performance and
    security, etc.”</em><a href="#fn:5" id="fnref:5" title="see footnote" name="fnref:5">[5]</a> The
    beneficiaries of OpenSSL’s public nature had donated, on
    average, some <strong>$2,000</strong> a year for this critical
    piece of software.<a href="#fn:6" id="fnref:6" title="see footnote" name="fnref:6">[6]</a></p>

    <p>The Heartbleed, vulnerability, when it became known, was a
    disaster of almost unimaginable proportions. Entire sectors of
    the internet were vulnerable to this exploit thanks to their
    reliance on this crucial underfunded piece of software.
    Companies like Amazon Web Services (annual sales, $5.11bn),
    Stripe (market valuation, $245bn) and Cisco Systems (annual
    income, $50bn) were exposed.</p>

    <p>That’s not just standing on the shoulders,
    that’s standing on the shoulders while the owner of the
    shoulders is five feet under water. To a great extent, the
    people who write FOSS software don’t even see this as a
    problem, they’re happy to have someone shoving them under
    the water.</p>

    <p>Take, as a different example, GitHub - the repository of
    much of the FOSS world’s source code. Its entire business
    model is predicated on the willingness of creators to share the
    product of their …</p></div></div>

<p>Welcome to The Embedded Rust Book: An introductory book about using the Rust
Programming Language on "Bare Metal" embedded systems, such as Microcontrollers.</p>
<h2><a href="#who-embedded-rust-is-for" id="who-embedded-rust-is-for">Who Embedded Rust is For</a></h2>
<p>Embedded Rust is for everyone who wants to do embedded programming while taking advantage of the higher-level concepts and safety guarantees the Rust language provides.
(See also <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch00-00-introduction.html">Who Rust Is For</a>)</p>
<h2><a href="#scope" id="scope">Scope</a></h2>
<p>The goals of this book are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Get developers up to speed with embedded Rust development. i.e. How to set
up a development environment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Share <em>current</em> best practices about using Rust for embedded development. i.e.
How to best use Rust language features to write more correct embedded
software.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Serve as a cookbook in some cases. e.g. How do I do mix C and Rust in a single
project?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This book tries to be as general as possible but to make things easier for both
the readers and the writers it uses the ARM Cortex-M architecture in all its
examples. However, the book doesn't assume that the reader is familiar with this
particular architecture and explains details particular to this architecture
where required.</p>
<h2><a href="#who-this-book-is-for" id="who-this-book-is-for">Who This Book is For</a></h2>
<p>This book caters towards people with either some embedded background or some Rust background, however we believe
everybody curious about embedded Rust programming can get something out of this book. For those without any prior knowledge

<h2><a href="#how-to-use-this-book" id="how-to-use-this-book">How to Use This Book</a></h2>
<p>This book generally assumes that you’re reading it front-to-back. Later
chapters build on concepts in earlier chapters, and earlier chapters may
not dig into details on a topic, revisiting the topic in a later chapter.</p>
<p>This book will be using the <a href="http://www.st.com/en/evaluation-tools/stm32f3discovery.html">STM32F3DISCOVERY</a> development board from
STMicroelectronics for the majority of the examples contained within. This board
is based on the ARM Cortex-M architecture, and while basic functionality is
the same across most CPUs based on this architecture, peripherals and other
implementation details of Microcontrollers are different between different
vendors, and often even different between Microcontroller families from the same
vendor.</p>
<p>For this reason, we suggest purchasing the <a href="http://www.st.com/en/evaluation-tools/stm32f3discovery.html">STM32F3DISCOVERY</a> development board
for the purpose of following the examples in this book.</p>

<p>Identity politics has become one of the, if not <em>the</em>, predominant markers of American politics during the past ten years. Previously relegated to the extremes of the political spectrum, it has now come to encompass mainstream political discourse and has come to define, not only the political playing field, but also social and economic life.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When Google encourages people to make online purchases based on the pigmentation of online business owners’ skin, you can be sure that identity politics has reached a tipping point.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However honorable you may think the goals of certain strains of identity politics may be (whether left, right, or middle), or however important you think certain tactical victories made possible by identity politics are, in the long run, as they say, it all ends in tears.</p>



<p>While identity politics was once primarily the purview of the American left, it has now infected the right as well. While once the banner of racial solidarity and sexual identity was raised in the name of progressivism, it now flies over the ranks of the reactionary, traditionalist right. As should have been expected. Both are equally cancerous for American government and society.</p>



<p>And now we have a culture war where the battlelines (racial, sexual, cultural, and national) are drawn in such a way that it is impossible to defect to one or the other side without being burned at society’s stake, no matter how good your intentions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Of course, neoliberalism itself bears much of the blame. In a (deeply misguided) effort to enact equality, neoliberalism claims that people are, or should be, entirely free of any socially distinguishing characteristics and context. Neoliberalism claims that background, history, family, faith, and culture should have no extant claim on the individual. In this way, neoliberalism suppresses human individuality. And, as is the case when something is suppressed, reactions to the suppression are often overdone and unhealthy.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But identity itself is not the problem. Far from it. Identity is essential to humanity. Rather, it is identity <em>politics</em> that is the root of this current evil.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Politics is the process of collective action. In order to act collectively, people need to feel common cause with others. That is, they need to form groups based on some shared desire or belief. This is normally a normal and healthy, if somewhat contentious, process.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, when the common cause around which people congregate is identity, you have a problem. This is because, even on the extreme left—being possessed, as it is, by doctrinaire relativism—identity is nonetheless viewed as more or less “essential,” or even immutable.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While it may seem a contradiction, the identitarian left views identity as biological and essential in cases of race and culture (i.e., your skin color and history) on the one hand, while simultaneously viewing identity as a matter of personal preference in the case of sexuality (i.e., your gender and who you are attracted to). Either way, identity is viewed as essential or immutable and unchangeable by society. Hence the negative reactions on the left to racial/cultural appropriation and conversion therapy.</p>



<p>Identity is also problematic as a common cause for collective action on the identitarian right. Here, identity is viewed as equally essential and immutable. In the case of the right, the basis for identity is nativism and culture (i.e., your country of birth and your history). Hence the negative reactions on the right to immigration and non-Christian religion.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In either case, the cause for collective action in identity politics is not purely shared sentiment, but essential and immutable identity. In other words, the side you belong to is predetermined. Deserters can and will be shot (c.f. RINOs and Uncle Toms). This is, of course, a formula for political (and social) disaster. In Rwanda, Srebrenica, and Nazi-controlled Europe, as well as throughout history, it led to genocide.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It should be noted, though, that the problem with identity politics is not <em>identity</em> as such, but rather the need to create identities that are large enough to enable collective action. By creating large identity groups through evoking large-scale identifiers such as race, religion, culture, etc., you not only create “us” and “them,” but you necessarily emphasize one or two aspects of peoples’ identities, while downplaying others, all in the name of unity.</p>



<p>In other words, the process of identity politics renders individual identity invisible, to use the leftist terminology. Which is ironic considering the emphasis the left places on how racial, cultural, and sexual identity are rendered invisible by the “white, male patriarchy.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>But whether identity politics divides people based on race, sexual identity, intersectionality, nationality, or religion, the result is the same; <em>true </em>diversity and <em>true</em> individuality are suppressed, erased, and made invisible. All in the name of “the cause.”</p>



<p>Which is sad, because individuals are <em>so</em> much more than a caricatured composite of how they look, who they are attracted to, and where they were born. In other words, the <em>identity</em> of identity politics doesn’t go <em>nearly far enough</em>.&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>Of course</em>, race, sexuality, and the country, culture, and religion in which we are born, make up part of who we are. But so do our other genes and phenotypes, our individual personalities, our highly idiosyncratic and eclectic values, beliefs, preferences, attitudes, behaviors, quirks, and, of course, the <em>choices</em> we make independent of all of these.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Liberalism—at least as it was classically understood (c.f. Kant, Locke, etc.)—was revolutionary because it placed a unique and immutable value on <em>the individual</em>. Not the individual’s race, sexuality, religion, or place of birth, but <em>the individual as such</em>, recognizing each as unique and uniquely valuable. Full stop. Identity politics suppresses this fact in the pursuit of political power.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As the napalm of political tools, the use of identity politics, whatever its intended ends, should be categorically rejected by all ends of the political spectrum.</p>

<p>We already had one instance of Bitcoin being artificially manipulated upwards, in 2013, and most people who bought in got screwed. At the time, the fraud was happening on MtGox, an exchange that was processing over half of all trading volume, and was in a position to manipulate the market.</p>



<p>Today, over 70% of Bitcoin trading is happening against USDT, a stablecoin that’s being printed out of thin air at an exponential rate. People who are still buying Bitcoin with real dollars, now that everyone has understood the scheme, are simply the greatest fools who allow the scammers to cash out, right before the collapse.</p>



<h3>The best performing asset in the world</h3>



<p>If you think Bitcoin is the best performing asset right now, think again. You’re going to kick yourself for missing this one:</p>



<figure><img src="http://www.tr0lly.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-12-at-18.31.45.png" alt="" srcset="http://www.tr0lly.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-12-at-18.31.45.png 999w, http://www.tr0lly.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-12-at-18.31.45-300x159.png 300w, http://www.tr0lly.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-12-at-18.31.45-768x407.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 999px) 100vw, 999px"></figure>



<p>Yes, it’s a one year chart, and the asset in question is really up 2,300,000% over the last year. That’s two million three hundred thousand percent ARR. And it’s not some unknown painting that turned out to be a Da Vinci, that only an insider could buy before it mooned. No, it’s a stock index, everything is legit, the chart is from Bloomberg. And I can guarantee you that if you buy in today, you’re still early. It will continue to moon next year as well.</p>



<p>The chart above is that of the <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/IBVC:IND">Caracas Stock Exchange Stock Market Index</a>. You might have noticed that it’s denominated in VES, or Venezuelan Peso, a currency that’s going to lose half its value before the end of the day, as a result of relentless money printing by the Venezuelan central bank.</p>



<p>You can check the stock prices of any country with high inflation – from Zimbabwe to Argentina – and you’ll notice the same pattern, over and over again. “Money printer goes brrr” makes asset prices denominated in that currency go to the moon, and it’s never too late to join the party.</p>



<p>Obviously investing in Venezuelan or Zimbabwean equities won’t make you a billionaire in a few month’s time. The falling value of the currency will offset the gains, and you’ll end up holding some rather illiquid stocks that will be worth… probably something, but not billions of US dollars.</p>



<p>In the past, Venezuelan government officials tried to hide this reality by setting an “official” rate for the peso against the US dollar. Of course, you couldn’t buy any dollars with your pesos at that rate, but for someone who wasn’t paying attention, it might have looked like things weren’t that bad. </p>



<p>You could, of course, buy pesos with your dollars at that rate, but nobody was that stupid. Venezuelans knew the truth, because they were witnessing that the value of the peso was plummeting: a bag of carrots at the market would cost a thousand of pesos one day, and two thousands the day after, and so forth.</p>



<h3>A Potemkin village of a market</h3>



<p>But what if you couldn’t buy anything with your pesos, but the stock market? What if the Venezuelan government had such a tight grip on appearances, and on places that traded the peso, that you wouldn’t know the truth, at least for a while? You’d only see a chart that’s mooning, and only hear about people buying in because it was mooning, and those people would seem to be making stupid amounts of money day after day.</p>



<p>If you think this is impossible, google “<a href="https://www.investopedia.com/news/bots-drove-bitcoins-150to1000-rise-2013-paper/">Willy Bot</a>“. At the time, the online exchange MtGox was an absolute leader in Bitcoin trading, with over half of all worldwide trading volume. You would wire your dollars to MtGox, receive MtGox credits in your account, that everyone believed to be worth their face value in USD, and buy Bitcoin with them. Bitcoin went up as if on steroids, and nobody questioned the goose that laid golden eggs.</p>



<figure><img src="http://www.tr0lly.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/coindesk-bpi-chart-86-728x404.jpg" alt="" srcset="http://www.tr0lly.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/coindesk-bpi-chart-86-728x404.jpg 728w, http://www.tr0lly.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/coindesk-bpi-chart-86-728x404-300x166.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 728px) 100vw, 728px"></figure>



<p>Until too many people tried to cash out, and MtGox went bust. You might notice that the price of Bitcoin didn’t crash that much afterwards, for the very simple reason that the exchange froze everyone’s accounts. Nobody was allowed to access their Bitcoins once the truth was out. Bitcoin not crashing to zero is little solace when you lost yours.</p>



<p>This was the exact same scenario as described with the imaginary all-powerful Venezuelan government – a central party (MtGox a.k.a. the Venezuelan government) that’s able to distort the perception of reality and print its way to the moon, attracting hordes of wannabe millionaires. Until one investor too many try to cash out and everything collapses.</p>



<h3>Fool me once…</h3>



<p>Surely that couldn’t happen again, people aren’t THAT stupid, right?</p>



<p>Well, it’s happening again. Over <a href="https://blog.kaiko.com/tether-vs-usd-is-a-dollar-a-dollar-when-it-comes-to-trading-4632380f4284">70% of Bitcoin is traded against USDT</a>, a stablecoin that’s being printed at an exponentially growing rate:</p>

<p>There are no basis for believing that USDT tokens are worth anything. USDTs are issued by Tether, a shady company whose legally declared office doesn’t exist, and that’s being investigated by the NYAG for fraud. Legally, USDTs are worthless: only a few selected secret parties can ask to redeem them for US dollars, and even then, Tether has the right to delay the redemption requests for as long as they want:</p>



<figure><img src="http://www.tr0lly.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-12-at-19.27.05.png" alt="" srcset="http://www.tr0lly.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-12-at-19.27.05.png 740w, http://www.tr0lly.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-12-at-19.27.05-300x118.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 740px) 100vw, 740px"><figcaption>source: tether.to/legal</figcaption></figure>



<p>You cannot buy anything with USDTs but cryptocurrencies – mainly Bitcoin. There is no reason to believe that USDTs aren’t printed out of thin air: Tether has systematically failed to provide an audit of its reserves, and they won’t even say what those reserves are. <a href="http://www.tr0lly.com/bitcoin/the-great-tether-bitcoin-collateral-flippening/">Cryptocurrency macro flows show that USDTs are most probably backed by Bitcoins themselves</a>, meaning that USDTs are issued to buy Bitcoin, thus pumping Bitcoin’s price.</p>



<p>The problem with USDTs being backed by Bitcoins is that Bitcoin can’t fall, or USDTs will no longer be properly backed, and exchanges will panic. This forces Tether to keep printing ever more USDTs to pump Bitcoin’s price, in an exponential race to the death until exchanges can no longer maintain the USDT peg because people who made millions of paper gains try to cash out – albeit a little bit, and everyone realises USDTs were just a fancy version of the Venezuelan peso.</p>



<p>However, as long as the day is young and there are more real USD buyers than USD sellers, the scammers can cash out for real dollars. The mechanics of the scheme are simple:</p>



<figure><img src="http://www.tr0lly.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-12-at-20.47.32.png" alt="" srcset="http://www.tr0lly.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-12-at-20.47.32.png 657w, http://www.tr0lly.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-12-at-20.47.32-300x206.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 657px) 100vw, 657px"></figure>



<h3>The rising price fallacy</h3>



<p>With Bitcoin going up by 20% every month, a lot of people might be tempted to think, “hey, even if it’s a Ponzi scheme, it only needs to go on for a few more months and I’ll double my money, and then I’ll cash out before it collapses”.</p>



<p>But that’s the thing with fake markets – most people lose all their money, because most people don’t manage to cash out before the scheme collapses. The moment the inflows of USDs start to dwindle, the scammers close shop and disappear. Remember – these scammers have painstakingly put the scheme together with only one goal: get as much real dollars as possible, by selling you Bitcoins they’ve purchased with worthless tokens. They will not give a penny of their loot back, the moment they think their scheme is unraveling.</p>



<p>If you aren’t an insider, you have no way of knowing when that will happen, so your decision of buying in or cashing out is taken randomly. If you don’t have any insider information, you become part of the statistic. And statistics say that 99% of people will lose everything, and that you will almost certainly be in that 99%.</p>



<p>The rising price fallacy is the misconception that the longer a scheme goes up in price, the lower are the chances of it crashing in the near future. The reality is the exact opposite: the scheme has to suck in a lot of fools to establish that upward price chart, and by the time you, a random person with no inside information, has noticed it, most people are already invested, and you’ll just be part of the final herd.</p>



<p>Of course everybody thinks that they’re special, that they’re not part of the herd, that they’re smarter than the rest. That’s why the scam works. Because people need to rationalise the fact that they’re smarter than the rest, the founding pillar of Bitcoin communication is, “you’re still early”, and “more people are coming”. Much has been said about Tesla buying $1.5 billion worth of Bitcoin. But nobody is talking about the fact that someone has SOLD Tesla $1.5 billion worth of Bitcoin. Why has someone sold $1.5 billion worth of Bitcoin? Weren’t THEY aware of the fact that Bitcoin can only go up?</p>



<figure><img src="http://www.tr0lly.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Emperors-New-Clothes.jpg" alt="" srcset="http://www.tr0lly.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Emperors-New-Clothes.jpg 540w, http://www.tr0lly.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Emperors-New-Clothes-300x201.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 540px) 100vw, 540px"></figure>



<p>Nobody is talking about the crash to come, precisely because everyone invested knows that it’s a manipulated market, and they are hoping to cash out before the others. So the last thing everyone wants to do, is say anything that might make the other investors doubt, which could make those investors think about cashing out before they do. The tale of Emperor’s New Clothes is as old as civilization itself.</p>



<p>The endgame is simple: for everyone who is buying in, people are cashing out. Those who are cashing out, are part of the 1% who won’t lose it all. Statistically, you aren’t part of them.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <p>I got fed up with macOS. While the new hardware(Apple Silicon) got amazing feedbacks, the OS itself
is so lag behind.</p>

<p>I got a Windows 10 desktop at home and heck, it was event much more pleasant to use than using macOS.</p>

<ul>
  <li>As a typical user (web browsing, mail and office stuff), Windows 10 is very good.</li>
  <li>As a developer, it’s getting a lot better with WSL/Microsoft Terminal/etc…</li>
</ul>

<p>I decided to give Linux another evaluation test. I pick Manjaro - an Arch-based over an Ubuntu-based 
distro this time after hearing all kind of praise from its users. But I also don’t want to configure
everything I need to use, hence Manjaro.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Manjaro is a user-friendly Linux distribution based on the independently developed Arch operating 
system. Within the Linux community, Arch itself is renowned for being an exceptionally fast, 
powerful, and lightweight distribution that provides access to the very latest cutting edge - and 
bleeding edge - software. However, Arch is also aimed at more experienced or technically-minded 
users. As such, it is generally considered to be beyond the reach of those who lack the technical 
expertise (or persistence) required to use it.</p>

  <p>via <a href="https://wiki.manjaro.org/index.php/About_Manjaro">wiki.manjaro.org</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>So looks like it got the best of both worlds right?</p>

<h2 id="the-test-setup">The test setup</h2>

<p>I built a new mini PC recently. It’s the Asrock Deskmini X300W that use AMD processor. If you prefer
Intel, you can choose the Intel version of the box.</p>

<p>I went with AMD because I like their Zen offering and I would love to support them.</p>

<p>I just throw a 6 cores AMD 4650G processor, 32GB of 3200Mhz Crucial memory, 512GB Samsung NVME drive for 
OS and other stuff plus another 1TB 2.5’ SSD for storage.</p>

<p>For OS, I went with Manjaro KDE variant because I like the look of it.</p>

<h2 id="the-experience">The experience</h2>

<p>Almost everything works out of the box.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The graphic works right. I do not have an Intel GPU so it’s much easier for me but I hear 
terrifying stories from other side of the world.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>WiFi works. Zero complaints here.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The bluetooth is almost ok. Most stuff I throw at it works, except an old Xbox One controller of
mine. The one came with Xbox One S works with 1 minor additional step (disable ERTM). I tested with
4 bluetooth mouses, 2 keyboards, 1 speaker and 2 Xbox controllers.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Since I pick KDE, it’s a bit troublesome to use setup i3 wm. After reading several tutorials, I 
decided not to bother with one. Instead, I settled with 
<a href="https://github.com/esjeon/krohnkite">krohnkite</a> plugin for KWin. It works really well for my needs
, given that my needs are pretty basic.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do gaming once in awhile and Manjaro even came bundled with Steam (LOL). One might say it’s so
bloat but I’m ok. Storage is cheap these days.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Developer experience is awesome. Linux is usually first-class platform for open source projects.
Everything just works. Docker is so fast because no VM required. It’s the best platform for 
developers, hands down.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>So far, I’m loving it. It does everything I need and works with all the peripherals I have, 
with the exception of the Xbox One controller (wired connection still work though). I’m gonna stick with
Manjaro for now. I don’t see myself moving to Arch since my love for tweaking the system is long
gone. I just want something that works and Manjaro does work very well for me.</p>

<p>Jerry Brown was the governor of California from 1975 to 1983 and again from 2011 to 2019. He was also the mayor of Oakland from 1999 to 2007 and California’s attorney-general from 2007 to 2011. He recently cofounded the California-China Climate Institute at the University of California, Berkeley.</p>

<p>Stewart Brand is a writer and was the editor of the Whole Earth Catalog and of CoEvolution Quarterly. He cofounded the Long Now Foundation in 1996.</p>

  </div>
</div>


<p><em>This conversation was facilitated by Noema deputy editor Nils Gilman.</em></p>



<p><strong>Gilman: </strong>Governor Brown, how did you first formulate the idea of planetary realism?</p>



<p><strong>Brown: </strong>It happened in a mundane way. I was running for president in 1976, and I was formulating some ideas on foreign policy. As I discussed these issues with knowledgeable people, I thought of the world as being deeply interconnected. I had the sense that it wasn’t just “us against them,” but rather that there was connectivity among all nations across a range of issues.</p>



<p>On the one hand, I wanted to be realistic: hard-boiled, not getting carried away with utopianism. That’s the realistic side: Morgenthau, Machiavelli, Kissinger. But on the other hand, I wanted to add a dose of humanism and romanticism as well. I wanted to combine realism with some more thoughtful ideals, reflecting something more caring. So, I took the word “realism” and put it together with “planetary,” because this was the early part of the environmental movement — the <span data-note="The Stockholm Conference was among the United Nations’ first major international environmental symposiums.">Stockholm Conference</span> had just happened in 1972.</p>



<p>Back then, I wasn’t thinking about climate change, but rather of the sea and of nuclear war. I argued that we had to see the big picture — you might call it the “whole Earth perspective,” as opposed to nationalism and the politics of scapegoating. We can’t let nationalism run away with us — we have to think of the interests we share. Today, that includes the shared vulnerability to viruses, cyber-attacks and climate change.</p>



<p><strong>Gilman: </strong>With that frame in mind, how has your thinking about planetary realism changed over the last four decades?</p>



<p><strong>Brown: </strong>My concern about blindness and beliefs has intensified. I’m taken with how strong beliefs are, and I don’t say that in a positive way: Recent politics has become the collision of beliefs.</p>



<p>I’ve become impressed with the lack of this thing called “reason.” I used to think that, overall, we’re reasonable people. But now I think we’re all belief people. We’re not fact-based — we’re belief-based. I think of the end of the poem “Dover Beach” by Matthew Arnold:</p>



<div><p>And we are here as on a darkling plain<br>Swept with confused alarms of struggle and flight,<br>Where ignorant armies clash by night.</p></div>



<p>I look out today and see a lot of what I would call ignorant armies clashing by night. The result is that I have become more minimalist in my assertions. As a governor, I had to decide things all the time, and I didn’t always have time to probe too deeply. Therefore, I decided to go after things where I thought it was pretty clear what we needed to do, like climate change and prison reform.</p>



<p>On most things, we either aren’t clear or we don’t have the time or inclination to get to the bottom of them. I would say that today I know more, including that the universe is much bigger than I realized. So, I’d say a bit of humility has entered the picture.</p>



<p><strong>Gilman: </strong>Stewart, does your trajectory around “whole Earth thinking” mirror the governor’s on planetary realism? Where did the idea of the “whole Earth” come from to begin with?</p>



<p><strong>Brand: </strong>For me, it began in 1966, right after the <span data-note="The Trips Festival was a weekend-long, LSD-infused, immersive arts and music experience in San Francisco in January 1966 that is now recognized as a landmark moment in the early hippie counterculture movement of the 1960s and 1970s.">Trips Festival,</span> which I had helped to organize. On the roof of my apartment in San Francisco, I had an LSD-laced vision where I asked myself, “What am I going to do for humanity?” And looking up, I thought: If we saw a plausible photograph of Earth from outer space, ideally in color and ideally of the whole globe, not just one section of it, that could make a difference. I started promoting that, handing out buttons that asked, “Why haven’t we seen a photograph of the whole Earth yet?” When that photo was finally published, it provided the cover for the Whole Earth Catalog. For me, the whole Earth has been a frame that directed attention toward things we might otherwise not take seriously.</p>



<p>So, when Jim Lovelock and Lynn Margulis proposed the <span data-note="The Gaia hypothesis suggests that all living matter on Earth forms a synergistic complex system, likened to a single organism, regulating the conditions for life.">Gaia hypothesis</span> in the early 70s, CoEvolution Quarterly, which I was then editing, was one of the first places to print it and then print a debate about it. At the time, a lot of biologists were pretty skeptical, even hostile, to the Gaia hypothesis. A scientist up in Canada named W. Ford Doolittle wrote to me and said something like, “Gaia is an intriguing idea and idealistic, but it makes no sense in terms of evolution, because if the Earth is supposedly adapting, what is it adapting in relation to? You can’t have a species of one individual. Fitness only makes sense in relation to other individuals. But with Gaia, there are no other individuals.” Doolittle and Lovelock went back and forth, and I printed that.</p>

  </div>
</div>




<p>But here’s an update: Just last year, Doolittle published an <a href="https://aeon.co/essays/the-gaia-hypothesis-reimagined-by-one-of-its-key-sceptics" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">essay</a> saying, “You know what, I think Lovelock and Margulis were right.” He revised his thinking about how evolution works to account for what you might call group selection, outside of the individual, to include whole arrays of things. His piece looked at “nested arrays,” all the way up to the whole Earth as itself a nested array of various forces. One of the things he notices is an idea very much in line with the Long Now Foundation, which is the persistence of species and the persistence of individuals. In the same way, Bruno Latour and Timothy Lenton’s essay on <a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/361/6407/1066" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">Gaia 2.0</a> makes the point that some systems learn how to become good at persisting — and the Earth is one of those.</p>



<p>What I see now is that human civilization is in the process of trying to become like Earth, in the sense of learning how to become a persistent system. In this century, we’re going to get a lot of harsh lessons on how not to persist — and then we will either correct that, or we won’t.</p>



<p>My particular take on COVID-19 (besides dread) is that the best thing that COVID might do for us is give global civilization a chance to think in planetary-scale terms about a problem that, like climate change, is in a sense caused by all of us and can only be solved by a large quantity of us. There are examples of handling it well, like in Taiwan or New Zealand, and handling it badly, like here and in Italy. I see a chance in this century for civilization to get out of its adolescence, to become more mature, pragmatic, skeptical and solution-oriented (rather than story-oriented) so that we can reverse planetary degradation. This won’t be like ending the Cold War. This is a new kind of problem, where people have to really <em>connect </em>in order to fix it.</p>

  </div>
</div>




<p>In the introduction to the Whole Earth Catalog in 1968, I wrote, “We are as gods and might as well get good at it.” More recently, in “Whole Earth Discipline” (2009), I wrote, “We are as gods and <em>have</em> to get good at it.” What changed between those two statements is global warming, which changed the sense of who the “we” is.</p>



<p>The “we” in the Whole Earth Catalog are the individuals who were empowered to leave college and go get their own education in more interesting, exciting, inventive and creative ways than just studying for a degree. (The idea was to go out and start communes, things like that. All of them failed: Hey, we all learn our lessons!)</p>



<p>By contrast, the “we” of climate change has almost nothing to do with individuals. It’s the “we” of civilization: Civilization now has powers, godlike powers (in the sense of Greek gods, not the Christian God — we don’t have omniscience and never will).</p>

<p><strong>Brown: </strong>As I listen to Stewart, I’m reminded that one of the things that inclined me to focus was my training in the Jesuit seminary, where we were isolated in a small group to study large issues. The Jesuits call them the “last four things”: death, judgment, heaven, hell.</p>



<p>Now, I left all that behind for a number of reasons, not the least of which was skepticism, but what stayed with me was the hankering to relate to something really important. In today’s politics, I find that a lot of transient and trivial issues of the moment dominate the political imagination through the media, and in doing so, they diminish and marginalize these bigger issues we should be thinking about.</p>



<p>People say, wait, what about education funding? What about the property tax? But in relation to the larger, planetary issues, these seems like an evasion. An issue like climate change requires a different approach.</p>

<p><strong>Gilman: </strong>Governor Brown, given what you said earlier about the rootedness of people in belief rather than reason, how likely do you think it is that the public is going to be able to get there in terms of appreciating the complexity and seriousness of these planetary problems? Microbes and carbon molecules don’t care about borders. And in many ways, technological risk, like with nuclear weapons or artificial intelligence, doesn’t care about borders.</p>



<p>At the same time, however, the public and politicians still think in terms of narratives and have beliefs that in …</p></div></div>

I knew basic web development and not much more.</p><p>Since mid-2020, I've been working full-time as a data scientist, analysing Big Data with Spark, SQL and Python (for a company with $300 million annual revenue).</p><p>I built my skills alongside a full-time job as a doctor, by doing courses and projects in my free moments.</p><p>Here I'm going to share every course and project that took me from zero to a full-time technical role in just over 2 years.</p><h2 id="-what-s-the-use-of-a-project-list">📋 What's the use of a project&nbsp;list?</h2><p>This isn't a prescriptive list. Nor is it a 'how-to guide'.</p><p>Instead, I hope to:</p><ol><li><strong>Give inspiration for your own project ideas</strong></li><li><strong>Give insight into the journey of building data science + coding skills</strong></li></ol><p>I've shared project details, timelines and the rough amount of time spent on each. Of course, rate of progress depends on many factors (amount of time you can/want to put is key 🔑). I did this alongside a fairly demanding full-time job, so obviously could have made faster progress. But it was high on my priority list outside of work, so it could also have been slower.</p><h2 id="-themes-i-noticed">🎡 Themes I&nbsp;noticed</h2><p>Making this list helped me identify two themes:</p><ol><li><strong>I started with online courses but shifted to projects as soon as possible.</strong> (I'm a big believer that projects are where the real learning happens.)</li><li><strong>The projects got cooler and more complicated as time progressed.</strong> While each project builds your skills, it also helps you identify (i) what's possible and (ii) what's interesting.</li></ol><hr><h2 id="-the-journey-from-beginner-to-now">🛣 THE JOURNEY: FROM BEGINNER TO&nbsp;NOW</h2><h3 id="-1-the-javascript-road-trips-1-2-and-3-codeacademy-course-">(1) The Javascript Road Trips 1, 2 and 3 — CodeAcademy [COURSE]</h3><ul><li><strong>Date Completed: </strong>Jan — Feb 2018</li><li><strong>Time Committed: ~30 hours </strong>(roughly 2 evenings per week for 4-6 weeks)</li><li><strong>Link: </strong><a href="https://www.pluralsight.com/courses/code-school-javascript-road-trip-part-1" rel="noopener">Here</a> (now on Pluralsight).</li></ul><p>When starting off, I had no idea where to begin.

<em>2021-02-13</em><br>

<h2 id="baggins">Background</h2>

<p>
In the beginning, the CPU was created.
This has made a lot of people very angry and has been widely regarded as a bad move.

</p><p>
Though computers have only gained in popularity, in our interactions with them we have increasingly attempted to interact less with the CPU; and more and more with the abstractions that simply <i>happen</i> to be implemented atop CPUs.
One of the earliest such abstractions was the <b>instruction set architecture</b> (ISA).
The idea was this: instead of writing code for a specific CPU, you would design an abstract specification for one; a language, if you will, that could be spoken by multiple different CPUs.
You would then write code according to that instruction set, in that language, and it could be interpreted by any CPU implementing that instruction set.
This was desirable partly because it allowed code to be written once and run multiple placesâ€”the first inklings of portability, rising!â€”but mostly because it allowed you to think only of the specification while you wrote your code, and perhaps even forget for a moment that there was a CPU underlying it all.

</p><p>Ahhh, the power of abstraction in the morning...

</p><p>
Another such abstraction was the <b>mnemonic assembler</b>.
Before the assembler was created, CPUs and ISAs were instructed using numbers which had special meaning to the ISA in question.
For example, consider the following number<sup id="b0"><a href="#f0">0</a></sup> (in octal form, for no particular reason):

</p><pre>030514</pre>

<p>
In the context of the ISA implemented by the CRAY-1<sup id="b1"><a href="#f1">1</a></sup>, that number is understand to mean â€˜add the contents of registers A1 and A4, and store the result in register A5â€™.
The association between this numeric form and its meaning under the ISA is completely arbitrary, and serves only to remind our poor programmers that they are serving a CPU, whose native language is written with arbitrary numbers.
Wouldnâ€™t it be nice if, instead of meaningless <span>030514</span>, our CPU could understand a form like this one?

</p><pre>A5	A1+A4
</pre>

<p>
(This latter form, while no less arbitrary than the other, is arbitrary in a way which matches preexisting human arbitrarinesses.
 This makes humans feel warm and fuzzy inside, like theyâ€™ve conquered a part of the machine kingdom with their superior human intellect, and is called a â€˜mnemonicâ€™.)

</p><p>
Unfortunately, while CPUs are equally capable of parsing numbers like <span>030514</span> and strings of words like <span>A5	A1+A4</span>, they are much slower at the second.
Thus, a compromise was borne: a mnemonic assembler would be a program (like all programs, it would run on a CPU implementing an ISA), and it would translate mnemonic forms like <span>A5	A1+A4</span> into machine forms like <span>030514</span>.
This allows humans to <i>pretend</i> that the CPUs understand their own native language, while still allowing the CPUs themselves to run at tolerable speeds.

</p><p>
At this point, it is worth making a couple of things devastatingly clear.

</p><p>
First, an assembler that runs on a given ISA may produce machine code for that ISA, or machine code for a completely different ISA.<!--(An assembler that produces code for a different ISA than that on which is runs is sometimes called a â€˜cross assemblerâ€™, Ã  la â€˜cross compilerâ€™.)-->
</p><p>
Second, there is almost always a 1:1 correspondence between the mnemonics inhaled by a given assembler and the instructions it spits out.  (Where there is not, the situation is generally close enough to 1:1 as to make no ends.)
</p><p>
Third, mnemonics were not standardised the same way that ISAs were.  A given set of mnemonics only works on one ISA, but there might be any number of other mnemonic-sets that also work on that ISA.  (Despite this, a number of tropes tend emerge which are shared by all mnemonic-sets targeting a given ISA.)

</p><p>
At this point, we are ready to attack the problem at hand.
</p><p>
There is a popular group of ISAs variably known as:
</p><ul>
<li>x86
 <ul><li>x86-64?
  <ul><li>EM64T?
   <ul><li>x64??
    <ul><li>AMD64???</li>
    </ul></li>
   </ul></li>
  </ul></li>
 </ul></li>
<li>IA-32
 <ul><li>IA-32<b>e</b>???</li></ul></li>
</ul>
(The question marks have been added for comedic effect.
 In point of fact, they are about as funny as the overproliferation of names that this ISA seems to accumulate in much the same way that a pile of cow dung accumulates flies or that this sentence accumulates words.
 Unlike a pile of cow dung, however, no clarity emerges when you swat it; only more confusion.
 Which being said, you should still clean your CPU at least annually; use soap, warm water, and a soft rag to get the gunk out of the transistors.)

<p>
This ill-fated ISA, which has almost as many addressing forms as names and is so immensely complicated that a you need to read a 5000-page tome<sup id="b2"><a href="#f2">2</a></sup> plus an additional 400 or so pages of unofficial reference before you can even begin to be qualified to understand the consequences of a single of its instructions, will henceforth be referred to as â€˜â€œSIBâ€�â€™.
I give it that name not so much to deliberately sow confusion (though that is definitely a contributing factor) as because thatâ€™s the only name that everybody seems to agree is associated with it.
(This is also the reason its name is quoted: itâ€™s the only word, indeed the only idea in this missive I didnâ€™t make up from whole cloth, ripped cloth, cheese cloth, pins, pinheads, camembert<sup id="b3"><a href="#f3">3</a></sup>, angels, and heads of ã�®ã�£ã�ºã‚‰ã�¼ã�†.)

</p><p>
Because â€˜SIBâ€™ is, inexplicably, enduringly popular, a lot of assemblers have been made for it.
As I mentioned, though different assemblers are not always compatible with each other, tropes and commonalities tend to emerge.
In fact, there are two incompatible sets of tropes; they are generally called â€˜AT&amp;T syntaxâ€™ and â€˜Intel syntaxâ€™, and you can read about the differences <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86_assembly_language#Syntax">here</a>.

</p><p>
...but you knew all of this already.
If Iâ€™ve done my due diligence, you were incited by the title but are still looking for something to disagree (or agree) with strongly.
Patience!

</p><p>
I contend that the AT&amp;T syntax is harmful and bad, and should never be used, for any reason, under any circumstances, by anyone.
Hereâ€™s why:


</p><h2 id="the-real-biggy">AT&amp;T syntax is broken</h2>

<p>
This is the single greatest sin perpetrated by the AT&amp;T syntax.
If not for this, it would be sufficient to say that Intel syntax were superior.
If not for this, the use of AT&amp;T syntax would be at least be acceptable, at least be moral<sup id="b4"><a href="#f4">4</a></sup>, even if still in supremely poor taste.
If not for this, it would be <i>possible</i> to write correct programs using the AT&amp;T syntax.

</p><p>
Now, to be clear, I donâ€™t expect advanced safety features from an assembler.
I donâ€™t expect dependent types, or linear types, or even any types at all.
<i>But I would pretty damn well appreciate it if my assembler didnâ€™t <b>actively</b> try to sabotage me!</i>


</p><p>
Let me show you an example.
Hereâ€™s an annotated snippet of Intel-style â€˜SIBâ€™ assembly:

</p><pre>mov	eax, 28            ; (1) store the immediate value 28 in the EAX register
mov	eax, dword [28]    ; (2) load one â€˜dwordâ€™ (4 bytes) from memory location 28 and store it in the EAX register <!--;     (on some assemblers, â€˜dwordâ€™ should be replaced with â€˜dword ptrâ€™, or just elided entirely)-->
</pre>

<p>
Hereâ€™s another snippet, AT&amp;T syntax this time:

</p><pre>movl	$28, %eax          ; (1) store the immediate value 28 in the EAX register
movl	(28), %eax         ; (2) load one â€˜(l)ongâ€™ (4 bytes) from memory location 28 and store it in the EAX register <!--;     (on some assemblers, the â€˜lâ€™ can be elided)-->
</pre>

<p>
Good so far?
Reasonable?
Good.

</p><p>
I present to you two more candidates, again in AT&amp;T syntax:

</p><pre>movl	28, %eax           ; (3) ???
movl	($28), %eax        ; (4) ???
</pre>

<p>
Before you continue reading, I want you to imagine what it would make <i>sense</i> for those instructions to mean.
Should they even be correct?
If you happen to already know, try to forget (pray for oblivion from the horror...)

</p><p>
If you donâ€™t know, make your best guess.

</p><p>
Ready?
Here they are again, with annotations this time:

</p><pre>movl	28, %eax           ; (3) same as (2)
movl	($28), %eax        ; (4) load one long from memory location 0 and store it in the EAX register
</pre>

<p>
Wait, what?

</p><p>
Go back and read that again and tell me in what world that could possibly be okay.
Tell me in what world an assembler that silently accepts the above forms, that is almost certainly corrupting your meaning in a way you donâ€™t intend, could <i>possibly</i> produce correct code.
Tell me you would <i>never</i> forget to put a <span>$</span> in front of an immediate, and that you would never accidentally put one in a displacement.

</p><p>
This doesnâ€™t even have anything to do with Intel syntax.
This isnâ€™t a win for Intel over AT&amp;T.
This is just AT&amp;T syntax being straight-up batshit fucking bonkers for no very good reason.

</p><p>
All it would take to redeem AT&amp;T syntaxâ€”okay, maybe not redeem, but at least elevate from <i>Cocytus</i> to <i>Phlegyas</i>â€”would be to make syntaxes (3) and (4) illegal.
Thatâ€™s it.
Want to help?
Send a patch to your local AT&amp;T-style assembler to make it warn for both of those forms.
Give it a command-line flag to err instead of warning.


</p><h2>AT&amp;T is backwards</h2>

<p>
Having eaten the proverbial elephant, it is time to start addressing the smaller fry.<br>
Smaller fry: you have done an admirable job of being a thorn in my side.<br>
Reader: following are reasons why the AT&amp;T operand order is backwards.

</p><p>
Iâ€™m sure youâ€™re familiar with the issue, but hereâ€™s a quick refresher.
Intel first:

</p><pre>mov	eax, ebx           ; (1) load one dword from the EBX register and store it in the EAX register
add	eax, ebx           ; (2) load a dword each from the EAX and EBX registers, add them together, and store the result (truncated to a dword) in the EAX register
</pre>

<p>
AT&amp;T:

</p><pre>mov	%ebx, %eax         ; (1) load one dword from the EBX register and store it in the EAX register
add	%ebx, %eax         ; (2) load a dword each from the EAX and EBX registers, add them together, and store the result (truncated to a dword) in the EAX register
</pre>

<p>
In general, Intel instruction mnemonics take the form â€˜&lt;op&gt; &lt;destination&gt;, &lt;source&gt;â€™, where AT&amp;T uses â€˜&lt;op&gt; &lt;source&gt;, &lt;destination&gt;â€™.

</p><p>
Before continuing, I want to establish a couple of things.

</p><p>
First, the consistency argument is bunk.
The consistency argument in favour of Intel syntax is illustrated by the following example:

</p><blockquote>Putting the destination first is more consistent with other, higher-level languages like C.
<span>mov eax, ebx</span> is analogous to <span>eax = ebc</span>, and <span>add eax, ebx</span> to <span>eax += ebx</span>; in general, <span>op x, y</span> is analogous to <span>x op= y</span>.</blockquote>
This is a classic logical fallacy: itâ€™s an …</div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><figure><img src="https://serhack.me/images/bitcoin-getting-started/social_oasis.jpg"><figcaption><h4>A man looks for Bitcoin Oasis</h4></figcaption></figure><p>If you have heard about blockchain or cryptocurrency, then the term that initially comes to mind is <a href="https://bitcoin.org/">Bitcoin</a>. Launched 12 years ago, it was the late 2017 bull run that created a media frenzy that propelled Bitcoin into the mainstream and our modern day lexicon.</p><p>Often labeled as the “original” cryptocurrency, <a href="https://bitcoin.org/">Bitcoin</a> has been the catalyst (directly and/or indirectly) behind many new innovations in the blockchain and digital asset space, most notably <a href="https://ethereum.org/">Ethereum</a> and <a href="https://getmonero.org/">Monero</a>. Shortly after the late 2017 bull run lost its steam, interest in these new technologies started to fade ― but here we are in 2021 with Bitcoin having risen like a phoenix from the ashes. As you would assume, an appetite for the blockchain and digital asset space has returned and now it is more important than ever that we understand what exactly is behind this unique asset, Bitcoin.</p><p>This article is meant to be a guide for individuals who are new to cryptocurrency and want to learn about <a href="https://bitcoin.org/">Bitcoin</a>, specifically its use case and the different ways to become involved in the broader blockchain and digital asset space. My goal is to educate you on the basics and make sure that you walk away with a newfound perspective and understanding of <a href="https://bitcoin.org/">Bitcoin</a>.</p><h2 id="what-is-bitcoin">What is Bitcoin?</h2><p>Bitcoin is a peer-to-peer version of electronic cash whose transactions are recorded in a public distributed ledger called a blockchain. In late October 2008, Satoshi Nakamoto (whose identity is still unknown) published a white paper titled <a href="https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf"><em>Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System</em></a> on bitcoin.org (registered in August 2008) and subsequently posted it to <a href="https://www.metzdowd.com/pipermail/cryptography/2008-October/014810.html">a cryptography mailing list</a>. On January 3, 2009, the Bitcoin network was created when Satoshi Nakamoto mined the initial block of the chain, which is called the genesis block.</p><p>In essence, Bitcoin is a decentralized type of “digital money” that can be used by anyone around the world, at any time, and without restrictions or a central authority. Bitcoin is not backed by any bank or government and originally allowed users to freely send and/or spend it anywhere without trusting third parties.</p><p>At inception, the price of Bitcoin was approximately $0.01 and, as of today, the price has surpassed $40,000 per coin ― with many believing that it can grow exponentially higher to levels between $100,000 and $250,000 in the next year or so.</p><figure><img src="https://serhack.me/images/bitcoin-getting-started/extras_1_blockchain-80.jpg"><figcaption><h4>The transactions data are memorized through a chain-of-blocks</h4></figcaption></figure><p>Given that Bitcoin exists and operates within the confounds of the Internet, all user balances are kept on an immutable and fully transparent blockchain. Put simply, each Bitcoin transaction is broadcasted to the Bitcoin network and grouped with several other transactions in the form of a block, which the network’s miners validate. Once the block is accepted, the transactions get recorded on the blockchain (which, as you may recall, is a public ledger). Whenever this process is successfully completed, the network distributes new Bitcoin to miners for each block that has been validated ― this is referred to as a block reward.</p><p>The peculiarity of the blockchain is its distribution and decentralized properties, as all the nodes share a valid copy of the public ledger. In the Bitcoin network, nodes play a very important role ― think of them as “protectors” who are constantly monitoring Bitcoin’s blockchain to distinguish legitimate Bitcoin transactions from illegitimate ones. The basic job of a node is to prevent attempts to double-spend Bitcoins that have already been spent elsewhere. In addition, the process of mining is essential to validating transactions, as it ensures the overall trustworthiness and security of the payment network.</p><h2 id="advantages-and-limitations">Advantages and Limitations</h2><p>Members of the cryptocurrency community, who range from the tech savvy to your average retail investor, have adopted various perspectives regarding the fundamental driver of Bitcoin’s value (both in financial and non-financial terms).</p><p>On one side, there are the Bitcoin Maximalists who believe that Bitcoin is the ultimate financial innovation and will assume a mainstream role in global society ― to maximalists, other cryptocurrencies and traditional financial instruments are inferior. On the other side, you have cryptocurrency enthusiasts who believe Bitcoin’s technology is outdated and that other cryptocurrencies, such as Ethereum, have more expansive utility.</p><p>These arguments and differences of opinion (as it relates to Bitcoin) can often become confusing, so let’s dig deeper into some of the most common discussion points with hopes that you can decipher for yourself.</p><h3 id="advantages">Advantages</h3><ul><li>A blockchain is managed autonomously using <strong>a peer-to-peer network</strong> and cannot be shut down ― the only way to stop it is through shutting down or banning Internet access. (Note: Even though a blockchain or Bitcoin cannot be shut down, some jurisdictions have imposed restrictions on citizens that limit or ban the holding or trading of Bitcoin and/or other cryptocurrencies.)</li><li>There is no need to trust a third party. <strong>You are your own bank!</strong></li><li>Relatively quick and cheap transactions without intermediary fees (around 10 minutes on average per transaction), when compared to most leading cryptocurrencies.</li><li>Increasing adoption by merchants and individuals across the globe.</li><li>Largest market capitalization and name recognition, which will continue to promote its growth and (hopefully) price stability.</li></ul><h3 id="limitations">Limitations</h3><ul><li><strong>Lack of anonymity</strong> as transactions that take place in the Bitcoin network, along with many other leading cryptocurrencies, are fully transparent and can potentially be linked via chain analysis. In addition, strict AML/KYC regulations require many of the leading cryptocurrency trading exchanges to verify your most sensitive personal information.</li><li>Slow and expensive transactions, when compared to lesser known cryptocurrencies that can be sent within seconds and at a fraction of the cost.</li><li>Irreversible transactions. Once a transaction is sent, you cannot undo or cancel the transaction.</li><li>Achievement of its status as a currency will be challenging due to its volatile nature (i.e. swings in price) and regulations.</li><li>The core technology has some subtle limits that make Bitcoin outdated in comparison with other cryptocurrencies.</li></ul><p>Along with Bitcoin Maximalists and cryptocurrency enthusiasts, you have many individuals who simply like to be long-term holders of Bitcoin (because they believe in the fundamentals and value proposition) and others who speculate on the short-term price (e.g. day traders).</p><p>Whatever side you are on, there is no question that Bitcoin has established itself as a serious contender in the financial world and is here to stay for the time being. There may be other alternatives, but the granddaddy of cryptocurrencies still has the spotlight!</p><h2 id="how-to-obtain-bitcoin-from-an-exchange">How to Obtain Bitcoin from an Exchange</h2><p>Now that you have an understanding of Bitcoin and its utility, you may be interested in purchasing some. If that is the case, you have come to the right place as buying it is now easier than ever due to the growing number of exchanges and companies making Bitcoin accessible to the masses.</p><p>Some of the most well-known exchanges that allow you to purchase Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are <a href="https://coinbase.com/">Coinbase</a>, <a href="https://www.gemini.com/">Gemini</a>, <a href="https://www.kraken.com/">Kraken</a>, <a href="https://binance.com/">Binance</a>, and <a href="https://www.huobi.com/en-us/">Huobi</a>. While all of these exchanges list Bitcoin, not all of them offer the same cryptocurrencies ― so, it is recommended to open accounts across a few exchanges to ensure that you are provided adequate exposure.</p><p>Once you have created an account on an exchange, you can transfer your local fiat money via ACH or bank wire to the exchange. From there, you can purchase Bitcoin or another cryptocurrency in exchange for your local fiat money. In addition, after purchasing Bitcoin, you can exchange it for another cryptocurrency that you might not be able to purchase with your local fiat money. While some exchanges offer credit card purchases of Bitcoin, please keep in mind that the fees associated with this transaction are typically very high.</p><figure><img src="https://serhack.me/images/bitcoin-getting-started/extras_2_exchange-80.jpg"><figcaption><h4>You can exchange central currencies (EUR, USD) to BTC, but sacrificing privacy.</h4></figcaption></figure><p>Using any of the exchanges listed above is the easiest and most convenient way to purchase Bitcoin, as the majority of the other cryptocurrency exchanges do not support fiat currencies. This being the case, you can only exchange other cryptocurrencies (like Ethereum or Monero) for Bitcoin. <a href="https://cash.app/">Cash App</a> and <a href="https://www.paypal.com/us/webapps/mpp/crypto">PayPal</a>, some of the largest financial technology companies, offer its users the ability to purchase Bitcoin. While this is extremely convenient for users of these platforms, the downside for PayPal (not Cash App) is that your Bitcoin must remain on its platform, so you cannot transfer or send it. Remember: Not your keys, not your coins.</p><p>If you are not keen on using any of the methods described above, Bitcoin ATMs are a great alternative. There are over 14,000 physical ATMs worldwide, most of which can be found in major cities at peculiar locations such as a shopping mall, burger restaurant, or a bar. All you need to do is deposit cash and enter your Bitcoin address. Once you have completed the transaction, the funds will be sent to you. This is a very simple process and typically does not require any identity verification, but beware of high fees!</p><h2 id="who-accepts-bitcoin">Who Accepts Bitcoin?</h2><p>Over the years, many individuals and businesses have begun accepting Bitcoin as a form of payment. From time to time, you might have noticed stickers on a shop’s window that says “Bitcoin accepted here.” As mentioned above, after the bull run of late 2017 died down, overall interest in cryptocurrencies (especially Bitcoin) amongst merchants began to wane. Today, Bitcoin and the broader digital asset space has bounced back from a pricing perspective and, with this, so has the interest amongst merchants who have triggered another wave of increased acceptance, most notably <a href="https://apnews.com/article/financial-markets-elon-musk-bitcoin-061817c6795e75d1c3c9e9d6cfc4a911">Tesla</a> disclosing that it has invested approximately $1.5 billion into Bitcoin and that the company plans to accept Bitcoin as payment for its electric vehicles.</p><p>There have been a few prominent …</p></div></div>

<div itemprop="text">
<p>Even though interviewing for a software engineering job can be intimidating and frustrating (with whiteboard exercises, remote coding challenges, and even full days of onsite interviews), it’s a lot easier when you know what to expect and are well-prepared.</p>
<p>I’ve interviewed a few hundred software engineering candidates in the past 10+ years and designed hiring processes. My experience is limited to startups and mid-sized companies, so take everything you read here with that in mind. My advice may not get you into <a href="https://www.facebook.com/careers/facebook-life/how-we-hire" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Facebook</a> or <a href="https://careers.google.com/how-we-hire/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google</a> but will definitely increase your chances at mid-sized companies with a good culture!</p>
<p>In the first part of this article, I’ll give some context, then give you an actionable list to improve your experience and chances in your next interview</p>
<p>If you’re only interested in the actionable list, feel free to skip ahead to it.</p>

<h2 id="what-you-think-about-the-technical-interview-might-be-incomplete"><span id="What_you_think_about_the_technical_interview_might_be_incomplete">What you think about the technical interview might be incomplete</span></h2>
<p>First and foremost, a technical interview is almost never only technical. Up to a certain (and honestly, very useful!) level growing as a ‘coder’ is not that complicated. Many candidates perform pretty well if we purely look at their coding skills.</p>
<p>The thing is, you’ll rarely work alone in isolation on your own codebase. You’ll have teammates, you’ll need to agree on things with them, you’ll build on others’ code and others will build on your code. You’ll need to build solutions with a certain level of quality, in a future-proof way, for extensibility, and with performance in mind. Depending on your role and level, you’ll need to architect systems. You’ll need to mentor other engineers. You’ll need to onboard new team members. You’ll need to proactively reach out to other teams in the company and understand their points of view and problems. You’ll talk to product managers, UX researchers, designers, even customers sometimes. You’ll need to manage projects, make tradeoffs and decisions, and align other engineers with that.</p>
<p>Read my article about&nbsp;<a href="https://ochronus.online/technical-interview-myths/">the most common 11 technical interview myths</a> – you’ll get a better view of how people think on the other side of the table.</p>
<h2 id="types-and-stages-of-technical-interviews"><span id="Types_and_stages_of_technical_interviews">Types and stages of technical interviews</span></h2>
<p>Most companies use a combination of these steps:</p>
<ul><li>Screening call with a recruiter – We’re interested in your basic motivations; we’d like to have a gut feeling about what you’re looking for and do some sanity check here. You might get asked about your salary requirements, support you need for visa or relocation, timelines (when could you start, etc.). Some recruiters will also ask you whether you have applied elsewhere, so they know how urgent this is for them and you.</li><li>Screening call with the hiring manager – Expect some deeper dive into your experience on multiple fronts – tech and ‘soft skills’ alike. As a hiring manager, I’ll prepare by checking out your CV for talking points, maybe even your LinkedIn profile, and definitely GitHub. I’m not trying to judge you; I’m just looking for points of connection. I’ll answer any questions you have about the role, the company, the culture, potential teams you’d be joining, etc. My ultimate goal with this is twofold: would we be a good match for your (and vice versa) and whether I think you’d be successful in the role.</li><li>Remote technical screening – An alternative, or at some places precursor to the online coding exercise. This is with a human on the other end of the line – solving tech problems together; usually, you walk them through your solution.</li><li>Online coding exercises (LeetCode, HackerRank, etc.) – I know you all hate this. We need such a step to filter out people who can’t even code at all early on. You’d be surprised about the number of such applicants. I avoid algorithm/data structure exercises here and try to come up with somewhat interesting ones. Some companies use a much heavier set of exercises and judge your technical skills solely on this. While I disagree with that strategy, you need to get prepared for this, too.</li><li>Take-home assignment – this is one of the most polarizing interview steps for engineers. Some hate it, claiming it’s just free labor for the companies, and it takes too much time. Others love it because they feel they have the freedom to give it much time, really showing off their skills in their own comfortable environment. <a href="https://levelup.gitconnected.com/take-home-assignment-mistakes-which-will-guarantee-someone-else-gets-the-job-36bcee1cec1d" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Whichever camp you’re in</a>, you can expect some companies requiring this. You usually get a somewhat specified problem to solve, and you’re given different levels of freedom on how to solve it – some companies don’t mind you choosing whichever stack you like; others will even specify the framework.</li><li>Onsite workshop / remote workshop – I think this is the most interesting of all steps (well, for me, at least). It’s about solving problems together with people from the company in a simulated environment. You’ll need to show your communication, decision-making, and even prioritization skills here. Sure, people will look at your code’s quality, too, but ‘soft skills’ are just as important here. We’ll get strong signals about how it would be to have you on the team.</li></ul>

<p>Take the guesswork out of the equation. If you feel you don’t have enough information to prepare for your technical interview, just ask for more! We’re here to help you succeed. I really mean it. Sometimes we aren’t doing a great job with sharing enough information proactively about the interview steps but that’s not intentional! I’m always happy to help you prepare better – ask about anything, please. You’re doing both of us a favor with that. Simply ask during the previous technical interview step or just drop me or the recruiter an email at any time.</p>

<p>Make sure you arrive at your technical interview on time. If you can’t, for some reason, please let us know, we’ll happily reorganize for another time, no hard feelings (sh*t happens). Showing up on time isn’t only about respecting each other’s schedule – interview time slots are usually 100% utilized and by arriving 10 minutes late you’re reducing your own chance to be successful. You’re also making it more stressful for yourself than necessary. If you need time for commute or for your Zoom/Google Meet setup, think ahead and give yourself a buffer before the start. You’ll also love the extra 10 minutes before the interview to tune in and get calmer.</p>

<p>The biggest mistake you can do is thinking you understand the problem or what’s asked of you and jumping right into coding in the technical interview. Take your time, carefully read the problem statement, distill it, don’t think of solutions just yet. When you feel you understand what’s asked of you or when you thought about clarifying questions to ask, communicate. <a href="https://www.mindtools.com/pages/article/paraphrasing-summarizing.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Paraphrase</a> what you understood from the problem statement so you can verify it with your interviewers. Only when you’re on the same page can you shift into solution mode. Even if you come up with the best solution ultimately if you skip this step I’ll remember and have doubts about how it’d be to work with you. Thinking aloud is really useful here – it will help you and help me too to understand what’s on your mind.</p>

<p>Even if you know your trade and you’re the best engineer in the world, if you fail to communicate clearly during the technical interview we’ll have no way of knowing. This takes practice for most people, so take your time and prepare! Use standard terms that other engineers can relate to, avoid passive voice, and be able to articulate what’s going on in your mind while you’re thinking. If you need some time to think quietly, say so, don’t just fall silent suddenly. We’re trying our best to communicate our expectations around this but it might be a bit late when you’re in the interview. Trust me on this one, practice here goes a long way.</p>

<p>While you’d think the technical interview is about you answering questions, expect that you will need to ask a lot of them, too! When you are in the interview and something is not clear don’t default to thinking “Oh god, I should know this, I should understand” – sometimes we are interested in how you behave in such situations, and sometimes we’re just simply not good enough in giving enough context. If you’re stuck, a good technique is to ask for clarification! It’s also 100% OK to say things like “I didn’t quite get that. Could you rephrase please?” or “I’m not sure I understand what you’re asking”. These are good signals! I expect my team members to behave like this. These are not signals of you failing. I know it feels like that, but trust me, it’s just your brain playing tricks on you. I highlight this during the interview several times, to make sure the candidate feels safe asking such questions. Another technique I wholeheartedly welcome is paraphrasing – e.g. “What I understood from what you said is that I should implement this using co-monads” (said nobody ever).</p>

<p>Make us see that you’re deeply proficient in at least one technology. This can be a programming language, for example. Also, demonstrate that you know the adjacent technologies – most companies are looking for so-called <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidmichels/2019/09/27/going-pi-shaped-how-to-prepare-for-the-work-of-the-future/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">T-shape</a> engineers. This means that mentioning other aspects of the problem and the solution goes a long way. For example, if you’re asked to implement a service in NodeJS, mention how you’d deploy, monitor, and scale it, even if that’s not explicitly asked. No need to go into too many details (unless people ask you). If you’re only focused on a single piece of the puzzle I’ll have a hard time seeing how you’d perform well in a changing environment (where you’ll need to make connections and work on multiple zoom levels and be ready). This is a very generic statement and might not be true in the case of highly specialized roles, of course. On the other hand, if …</p></div></div></div>

	<p>
I remember my own struggle with calculus at university. Limits, integrals, differential equations. Lots of practice, lots of homework. Pages and pages of exercises. I loved math, the connection between algebra and geometry, the very pleasure of solving problems by making different concepts work together. But I hated doing the “paperwork”.
	</p>
	<p>
Taking it seriously, I still studied through the semester, studied harder the week before the exam, studied even harder the night before. I got 62/100. That's 1 point above the lowest possible passing grade.
	</p>
	<p>
Well, maybe math is not for everyone. But wait a minute! The next semester I took part in the Math Olympiad, went through the faculty round, then through the university round, went to the nationals, and even managed to score a few points there. Which counted as a pass on that semester's exam.
	</p>
	<p>
Professors were proud of me. And for almost a year, they thought that the first semester's score was a mistake. Until in the third semester, I scored 65/100.
	</p>
	
	<p>
Mathematics is a lot of things. It's the fun of problem-solving, it's the excitement of discoveries, it's the pride of accomplishments, and it's a ton of tedious computations, too. I never liked that last part. I still don't. That's why I'm so happy to live in the XXI century since I can give it away to computers and still enjoy the first three.
	</p>
	<h2>
<span id="index_sympy">SymPy</span> it is
	</h2>
	<p>
According to the <a href="https://www.sympy.org/en/index.html">official site</a>:
	</p>
	<p><i>
SymPy is a Python library for <span id="index_symbolic_mathematics">symbolic mathematics</span>. It aims to become a full-featured computer algebra system (CAS) while keeping the code as simple as possible in order to be comprehensible and easily extensible.
	</i></p>
	<p>
Symbolic mathematics? Algebra system? Sounds exclusive. Sounds like it's a tool for practicing mathematicians and the students who desperately want to become one. But it isn't. It's for practicing engineers who have just enough math knowledge to state a problem but not enough patience to solve it.
	</p>
	<p>
It does integration and differentiation. It finds limits, and it expands series. It solves equations and systems of equations. It can even do statistics. And it does it all just like you would do on an exam. It doesn't just compute numbers, it computes formulas.
	</p>
	<p>
It's a Python library that does the boring part of math for you. Moreover, it does it fast, accurately, and without angst. In other words, it is everything I'm not.
	</p>
	<h2>
Let SymPy do some math for you
	</h2>
	<p>
Let's say we want to model the sine function with a polynomial. Let's pretend we have a reason. Now how do we do that?
	</p>
	<p>
How about, we gather all we know about the sine function in one bowl and let SymPy do the rest? Sounds good?
	</p>
	<canvas id="sine" width="640" height="480"></canvas>
	
	<p>
We know that <i>sin(0) = 0</i>, right? Everybody knows that. Also, as you might have heard, you can approximate a small sine with its own argument: <i>sin(0.001) ≃ 0.001</i>. This means that the derivative of sine in 0 is 1.
	</p>
	<p>
The sine function climbs from 0 to π/2 and then it starts going down. In π/2 it's neither climbing nor descending, it's at its peak. This means that the derivative of <i>sin(π/2)' = 0</i>. Also, since the sine only climbs to 1, <i>sin(π/2) = 1</i>.
	</p>
	<p>
The sine is symmetrical relative to π/2. This means that it descends exactly as it climbs, and at the point where it reaches full π, its derivative is <i>sin(π)' = -1</i>, and the function itself <i>sin(π) = 0</i>.
	</p>
	<p>
Also, one less known (but easily computable) fact, the integral of the sine from 0 to π/2 is 1. Let's throw this into the bowl as well.
	</p>
	<p>
So, we have 7 facts. This implies 7 equations. This implies that our polynomial will have 7 coefficients and the highest degree will be then 6.
	</p>
	<p>
Let's translate it all into Python.
	</p>
	<div>
	<pre id="code_1">from sympy import *

a, b, c, d, e, f, g, x = symbols('a b c d e f g x')

sine = a*x**6 + b*x**5 + c*x**4 + d*x**3 + e*x**2 + f*x + g
sine_d = diff(sine, x)
sine_i = integrate(sine, x)

the_system = [
    sine_i.subs(x, pi / 2) - sine_i.subs(x, 0) - 1,
    sine_d.subs(x, 0) - 1,
    sine_d.subs(x, pi / 2),
    sine_d.subs(x, pi) + 1,
    sine.subs(x, 0),
    sine.subs(x, pi / 2) - 1,
    sine.subs(x, pi)
]

res = solve(the_system, (a, b, c, d, e, f, g))

for var, exp in res.items():
    print(var, srepr(exp))
</pre>
	</div>
	<p>
You can browse <a href="https://docs.sympy.org/latest/tutorial/index.html">the tutorial</a> if you like but it should be more or less clear as it is. <i>sine</i> is our polynomial model. <i>diff</i> is differentiation. <i>integrate</i> is integration. <i>solve</i> is solve. Simple! The only cryptic thing here is <i>srepr</i>. It turns the solution into a special form of expression that looks like this:
	</p>
	<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;(f, 'Integer(1)') <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;(c, 'Mul(Integer(5), Pow(pi, Integer(-5)), Add(Mul(Integer(-1), Integer(288), pi), Mul(Integer(-1), Integer(19), Pow(pi, Integer(2))), Integer(1092)))') <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;(d, 'Mul(Integer(10), Pow(pi, Integer(-4)), Add(Integer(-252), Mul(Integer(5), Pow(pi, Integer(2))), Mul(Integer(64), pi)))') <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;(a, 'Mul(Integer(28), Pow(pi, Integer(-7)), Add(Mul(Integer(-1), Integer(16), pi), Mul(Integer(-1), Pow(pi, Integer(2))), Integer(60)))') <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;(e, 'Mul(Integer(12), Pow(pi, Integer(-3)), Add(Mul(Integer(-1), Integer(8), pi), Mul(Integer(-1), Pow(pi, Integer(2))), Integer(35)))') <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;(g, 'Integer(0)') <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;(b, 'Mul(Integer(84), Pow(pi, Integer(-6)), Add(Integer(-60), Pow(pi, Integer(2)), Mul(Integer(16), pi)))')
	</p>
	<p>
Ok, this is not really helpful. We need the coefficients and SymPy gave us the way to compute these coefficients from <i>π</i>. Well, it's what it does, it computes things symbolically not numerically. Or does it?
	</p>
	<p>
Look! I'll add one more line and SymPy will compute our coefficients as floating-point numbers.
	</p>
	<div>
	<pre id="code_2">from sympy import *
from math import pi

a, b, c, d, e, f, g, x = symbols('a b c d e f g x')

sine = a*x**6 + b*x**5 + c*x**4 + d*x**3 + e*x**2 + f*x + g
sine_d = diff(sine, x)
sine_i = integrate(sine, x)

the_system = [
    sine_i.subs(x, pi / 2) - sine_i.subs(x, 0) - 1,
    sine_d.subs(x, 0) - 1,
    sine_d.subs(x, pi / 2),
    sine_d.subs(x, pi) + 1,
    sine.subs(x, 0),
    sine.subs(x, pi / 2) - 1,
    sine.subs(x, pi)
]

res = solve(the_system, (a, b, c, d, e, f, g))

for var, exp in res.items():
    print(var, srepr(exp))
</pre>
	</div>
	<p>
Have you noticed which line it is? Anyway, the result is now this:
	</p>
	<p>
(f, "Float('1.0', precision=53)") <br>
(c, "Float('-0.0049207268278655082', precision=53)") <br>
(d, "Float('-0.16323406244002545', precision=53)") <br>
(a, "Float('-0.0012523393437231091', precision=53)") <br>
(e, "Float('-0.00090780192609864056', precision=53)") <br>
(g, "Float('0.0', precision=53)") <br>
(b, "Float('0.011803020246125803', precision=53)")
	</p>
	<p>
The line was <i>from math import pi</i>. This overloads the <i>pi</i> in the scope to be a floating-point number, not a symbol. And voilà — SymPy is now numeric. We can take these numbers, put them into our polynomial and it will be our model.
	</p>
	<canvas id="sine_model" width="640" height="480"></canvas>
	
	<p>
The model works wonders in the <i>[0; π]</i> range. Outside this range it diverges from the sine but we never specified that it shouldn't.
	</p>
	<p>
The polynomial bears all the properties we told SymPy about with our equations and nothing more.
	</p>
	<h2>
Now let SymPy write some code for us
	</h2>
	<p>
Let's say we want something that looks like the sine but isn't. Something we can tweak interactively. Like the sine but with the movable middle point.
	</p>
	<p>
We can start the same way. Let's retain the point locations. The integral criterion along with the derivatives in the endpoints are better to be lifted. But that's just my opinion, you can try to retain them yourself and see what'll happen.
	</p>
	<p>
The code that states the problem looks like this:
	</p>
	<div>
	<pre id="code_3">from sympy import *

a, b, c, d, x, px, py = symbols('a b c d x px py')

sine = a*x**3 + b*x**2 + c*x + d
sine_d = diff(sine, x)

the_system = [
    sine_d.subs(x, px),
    sine.subs(x, 0),
    sine.subs(x, px) - py,
    sine.subs(x, pi)
]

res = solve(the_system, (a, b, c, d))

for var, exp in res.items():
    print(var, srepr(exp))
</pre>
	</div>
	<p>
When run, it prints out that:
	</p>
	<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;(c, "Mul(pi, Pow(Symbol('px'), Integer(-1)), Symbol('py'), Add(Mul(Integer(-1), Integer(3), Symbol('px')), Mul(Integer(2), pi)), Pow(Add(Pow(Symbol('px'), Integer(2)), Mul(Integer(-1), Integer(2), pi, Symbol('px')), Pow(pi, Integer(2))), Integer(-1)))")
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;(b, "Mul(Pow(Symbol('px'), Integer(-2)), Symbol('py'), Add(Mul(Integer(3), Pow(Symbol('px'), Integer(2))), Mul(Integer(-1), Pow(pi, Integer(2)))), Pow(Add(Pow(Symbol('px'), Integer(2)), Mul(Integer(-1), Integer(2), pi, Symbol('px')), Pow(pi, Integer(2))), Integer(-1)))")
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;(a, "Mul(Pow(Symbol('px'), Integer(-2)), Symbol('py'), Add(pi, Mul(Integer(-1), Integer(2), Symbol('px'))), Pow(Add(Pow(Symbol('px'), Integer(2)), Mul(Integer(-1), Integer(2), pi, Symbol('px')), Pow(pi, Integer(2))), Integer(-1)))")
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;(d, 'Integer(0)')
	</p>
	<p>
And now it's time to get back to that cryptic <i>srepr</i> thing from before. It stands for <i>symbolic expression</i>, and it's basically a ready-made syntax tree. It's like in Lisp only with somewhat more conventional parentheses. And since it's written in conventional C-style function form, it's incredibly easy to write an interpreter for it (see: <a href="https://github.com/akalenuk/wordsandbuttons/blob/cd585775b6b5176426c6a22ccbdb683b71fe62dc/pages/sympy_makes_math_fun_again.html#L336">the code on GitHub</a>).
	</p>
	<p>
For instance, here is a simple tool that turns SymPy s-expressions into runable JavaScript code.
	</p>
	
	
	
	
	<p>
Just press the button — and that's it! Of course, you can prettify the code however you like. But you can also use in raw like this (see: <a href="https://github.com/akalenuk/wordsandbuttons/blob/cd585775b6b5176426c6a22ccbdb683b71fe62dc/pages/sympy_makes_math_fun_again.html#L306">the example from this very page</a>).
	</p>
	<canvas id="not_sine" width="640" height="480"></canvas>
	
	
	<p>
But the best part of it, unless you're writing in some esoteric language, you don't even need an interpreter. SymPy can print out JavaScript code from the box with a single <i>jscode</i> function! It can also print in Rust, C++, Fortran, Matematica, and more. It's <a href="https://docs.sympy.org/latest/modules/printing.html">already there</a>.
	</p>
	<p>
They say that AI will replace programmers in the future. Well, for a certain part, the future is here. SymPy writes your code for you. Although, when writing code means translating equations without any creative thought involved, I don't mind being replaced.
	</p>
	<h2>
Conclusion
	</h2>
	<p>
I disagree with “math is not for everyone”. Math is vast and diverse. Surely there is enough math for everyone. But some parts of it are better left to computers.

<p>Roughly three years ago we started <a href="https://instagram.com/treetalks.lk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">TreeTalks</a>, it was a very simple idea, we deliver cacti, succulents and indoor plants to people who ordered them online.</p>
<p>Our main target group was people and companies who wanted to have a cacti, or an indoor plants. People who are working in offices loved to have an indoor plant to decorate their desk, companies loved to gift plants for their employees.</p>
<p>We also implemented the idea around gifting, people can gift an indoor plant to their friends, partners, friends etc. Every pot will be customised according to their needs, everything will be hand-painted, and it will include a message or a quote suggested by the user.</p>
<p>The idea was a niche one, and there was only one other similar small business who was doing somewhat similar idea. And our business grew and grew, people were happy to get an indoor plant as a gift, especially a customised one. </p>
<p>Well, you get the idea. Business was great, business was growing. Yet there was something that always bothered in the back of my mind, and I knew it was just a matter of time before the inevitable.</p>

Their brand is recognised everywhere, there is no company that does branding better than Apple.</li><li><strong>Proprietary technology – </strong>A monopoly should have a proprietary technology, for example Google. Google’s monopoly on search is built on top of their proprietary search algorithm. There is no other company in search that has an algorithm better than Google.</li><li><strong>Network effect – </strong>Something Facebook and its group of companies have in common. Even if someone else come up with a better solution, still they can’t beat Facebook because of it’s network effect.</li><li><strong>Economics of scale – </strong>Amazon is a good example for a monopoly with economy of scale. Amazon even though started out as a website to sell books online had the potential to sell just about anything they want though their website. The books were just the foot on the door, once they started expanding they had the potential to expand in to anywhere they wanted.</li></ul>
<p>So once I first read these principals by Peter Thiel, I know that my business had nothing. Three was very low barrier to entry, anyone could do it, and there was nothing proprietary in what we did, no network effect, we had nothing.</p>
<p>So what this meant was that, anyone was able to copy our business and do what we did. </p>
<h2>What copycats do</h2>
<p>For the first two years, there was no competition. People tried to come up with places that offered similar service to ours, but none of them succeeded.</p>
<p>But since we are living in a pandemic, and people need to find some extra income, more and more people started copying our business. And copying our business was easy, why?</p>
<ul><li>There is no barrier to entry</li><li>No one need to invest a big capital</li><li>There are were only few resources needed to get started</li><li>No special skill needed, anyone with drawing skills can do it</li><li>No propriotory technology</li></ul>
<p>Now when I scroll through Facebook and Instagram I see someone starting an instagram page or Facebook page to do exactly what we are doing.</p>
<p>And one or two copycats are easy to manage, however, just like everything else copycats also have a network effect. When a person see someone copying something, they also feel like copying it. They too want to jump in and to cash in when there is opportunity. </p>
<h2>Copycats drags the price down</h2>
<p>Copycats when there are plenty creates competition among themselves. I know that competition is a good thing, when we started TreeTalks, and when there was one other business doing the something, we had a nice completion amongst ourselves, each tried to better the other, and grab more fans on social media. But this was a healthy competition, the competition between the two pushed us to the limits and created the best versions of ourselves.</p>
<p>However, the competition that we have today, competition among copycats is not a healthy competition. It’s a fight to sell the product at the lowest price possible. And customers also want the lowest price, but there is a limit where one should not cross, and need to have a reasonable profit to the effort that you put it.</p>
<p>The same thing can be seen in freelancer platforms like Fivver and WpWork etc. Freelancers (specially from South Asia) tend to drag the price down to a point where professional developers, designers would not like to offer.</p>
<p><strong>Copycats and competition, even though is good for consumer can be bad for the growth of an industry. </strong></p>
<h2>I knew this day would come</h2>
<p>I knew this day would come, I’m happy that I created a small niche brand in our country, and made a decent income along the way. And I guess like all good business it’s time to pivot. The brand that we created, and the customers we gained must be used as the foot on the door for us to get into something better.</p>
<h2>Think before you start</h2>
<p>When you start something, always think about what Peter Thiel said. Make sure your business ticks at least one or more points of a monopoly. </p>
<p>If it does then awesome, but if it doesn’t that’s also fine. But make sure to keep it in the back of your mind that you should always be ready to pivot, or change the direction. Because copycats are coming to get you.</p>
<p>Always try to be a monopoly.</p>

<div>
<h2><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></h2>

<p>Schizophrenia, one might say, is very much a problem of interpretation. It is a problem of interpretation for the person concerned, although they may be unlikely to see it in these terms, and it is a problem of interpretation for any mental health professionals who might be involved in their care. Again, we – in our roles as psychiatrists, nurses, social workers, etc – don’t seem to spend very much time wondering if our way of conceiving schizophrenia is the most helpful one possible since most of our energy goes into the pragmatic problem of ‘illness management’.</p>

<p>The assertion that we can sum up schizophrenia as being an issue of information interpretation (or processing) inevitably seems simplistic, or reductive, depending upon whether one is trying to be&nbsp; either correctly scientific or correctly holistic. In this article I hope to show that it is neither, and that an information-processing model, with the addition of a little complexity theory, can radically expand our understanding of this condition, no matter what camp one belongs to.</p>

<h2><strong>THE PATIENT’S STORY:&nbsp; “IN THE DAYS WHEN I WAS GOD…”</strong></h2>

<p>In order to justify the opening sentence I will relate an encounter between myself as a first-year occupational therapy student and a young man (who we will call Steve) who was an inpatient in an acute psychiatric ward in a busy London hospital. Steve was exhibiting at the time what in psychiatric parlance is known as ‘florid, positive-symptom schizophrenia’. A consultant psychiatrist was conducting a brief interview as part of a ward round whilst the junior doctors, nurses, my supervisor and myself stood behind him and listened. Steve, with the slightly solipsistic air of someone who was repeating a story to an audience who didn’t really count (so that the recounting of it was a gesture for his own benefit more than anyone else’s) explained how he was from another world and not this one. His spaceship had crashed and was now broken. On this planet, he said, there existed a deadly type of radiation that caused amnesia and a loss of psychic powers. The effect of this radiation was slow but progressive, and the end result of the process was that anyone landing here would forget that they were not native to the planet, and become like everyone else. The powers that he used to have were not alluded to directly, but Steve clearly gave the&nbsp; impression that he had enjoyed, rather than suffered from them. At one point he spoke wistfully of “the days when I was God.” There was no comment from anyone when Steve had finished speaking, and after a period of quiet the psychiatrist proceeded to gently direct Steve’s attention to more practical matters.</p>

<h2><strong>MAKING SENSE OF MADNESS</strong></h2>

<p>There are various interpretive frameworks which we can bring to bear upon this story. On that occasion the dominant framework was what one might call ‘standard psychiatric,’ i.e. it was based on&nbsp; diagnostic aids such as DSM – III. It is worth at this point briefly clarifying what is meant by ‘interpretation’: to say that clinical data is interpreted within a specific framework means of course that the apparently chaotic or irregular information of our experience is subjected to a rule-based procedure that organizes that information to a particular (that is, unambiguous) categories, where each category possesses a precise meaning that is already known to the interpreter. Another way of putting this would be to say that the raw data of the clinical encounter is manipulated with respect to a set of fixed criteria, and for this reason we can say that all interpretations equal<em> rule-based interactions</em>. We might go further and say that all of the interaction between psychiatrist and patient – as far as it is informed by an interpretive model –&nbsp; is ‘rule-based’.&nbsp; The problem with rule-based interactions is something that we will come to a bit later on.&nbsp; DSM-III, in common with other such theoretical constructs in use in psychiatry, is rather a crude affair – it is not exactly a grand philosophical conception. On the other hand, one need hardly point out, it is not so much a satisfying philosophical conclusion that a psychiatrist wants but a practical way of helping his or her patients. Whether DSM-III (or the other diagnostic systems) are actually useful in this way is something that we need to seriously question – certainly the crudeness of the model seems to offend, in a basic way, against our capacity as sensitive and intuitive beings to seek and find deeper and more subtle ways of comprehending other people. This can be seen from the case given above: Steve comes out with what is by any standards an extraordinary story: under other circumstances he might be given respect for the undeniable creativity involved, but under these circumstances the content of his communication is not addressed. After processing through the&nbsp; DSM-III translation machine, all that comes out is the flat and unremarkable message “Steve has schizophrenia”.&nbsp; There is a tremendous loss of meaning going on here, a prodigious feat of information reduction has taken place. This is acceptable to all concerned because the ‘meaning’ that has been surgically removed from Steve’s story is automatically known to be, in retrospect,&nbsp; a species&nbsp; of randomness, the virulent and offensive ‘meaning-gone-wild’ of schizophrenic chaos. Basically, Steve was talking gobbledygook! Standard psychiatric interpretation does not differ too much from ‘lay interpretations’ of schizophrenia in this respect. If Steve want into a pub on the high street and came out with the same story, there is almost no doubt about what would be going through peoples’ minds: “Uh-oh…” your man on the next table would say, “this guy is cracked…”. There is a tiny chance that there might be a UFO spotter in the pub who will be prepared to subject Steve’s utterances to a different interpretive framework – but we will leave that possibility to one side. In any event, UFO perspectives may themselves be said to be rather crude, although maybe not as crude as psychiatric ones, if one takes as a rough sort of a measure the amount of wonder that one experiences in connection with the ‘truth’ that one perceives (i.e. the degree of irreducible<strong> [?]</strong> that permeates through the evaluative filter). One does not in the usual run of things experience any appreciable degree of wonderment when one realizes that a schizophrenic is, in fact, a schizophrenic and not a manic-depressive; on the other hand, when a UFO buff stops feeling any wonder over UFOs it is, arguably, time for him or her to give up UFOlogy as a bad job.</p>
</div>
<div>

<p>So far we have consider medical and lay interpretations, we could of course go on adding to the list. The classical Freudian interpretation of schizophrenia is to say that it is the result of the withdrawal of sexual interest from external objects to the world of internal objects. Thus, a Freudian would pay attention to Steve’s story with quite a different agenda. The crudity of the model is hardly any less, though, and there is nothing really in a psychodynamic explanation that&nbsp; adds to our discussion. What we can usefully take from all of this is the simple notion of <em>tautological self-confirmation as a basic principle pertaining to all rule-based interpretations</em>. This has been touched upon by Popper with regard to psychoanalytic interpretations, it is also true for the apparently scientific DSM-III system. This is obvious if we consider that we that we already know in advance what diagnostic categories are possible; there is no chance, even if psychiatry is practised for a million years, that DSM-III can be used to falsify itself. There is no chance of the system <em>learning</em>. A patient in a psychiatric hospital&nbsp; cannot throw any doubt on the validity of the interpretive system, no matter <em>what</em> he says or does. He or she might be utterly unique, constituting an absolutely unprecedented case, but after being processed through the machine they will come our utterly unremarkable, just another category….</p>

</div>

<div>
<p>This point can be more clearly made by considering the underlying logic of all information processing operations, and noting that all rule-based (i.e. linear) procedures are essentially tautological in nature, which means that all strictly rule-based interactions (i.e. those&nbsp; involving linear correspondences) must yield consequences that were contained within the rules in the first place. Robert Anton Wilson (1990) approaches the matter by contrasting Aristotelian two-term logic with John von Neumann’s three-term Quantum Logic. The two terms in A.L. are “YES” and “NO”; in Q.L. we have “YES”, “NO” and “MAYBE”. When we use Aristotelian Logic we tacitly assume that the universe is 100% congruent with our model of it, i.e. that our model describes everything that is important in the universe (this, of course, is where assumptions come in regarding what is, and what isn’t, seen to be important). This is obvious since, in A.L., all questions must illicit an answer that is either affirmative or negative.&nbsp; Quantum Logic, in contrast, allows for incongruence, a bit of a gap between model and reality. It allows for the possibility that there might be significant aspects to the concrete reality that are not described at all by the theoretical language being utilized to formulate the question; this is where the extra “MAYBE” term comes in – uncertainty is acknowledged.</p>

<p>We can make the suggestion here that perhaps the amount of uncertainty one can tolerate in the universe, the amount of time one has for the MAYBE component of answers,&nbsp; is a measure of one’s open-mindedness. This gives us a way of measuring the ‘crudeness’ of an interpretive framework. The less crude a framework, the better the approximation to reality…..&nbsp;&nbsp; The least crude of all would clearly be the situation where all one’s answers come back as big question marks and where uncertainty permeates everything. Yet what would be the use of this? The answer is plainly that it …</p></div></div></div>

He was certain nobody could have survived the crash but was proven wrong after he saw a woman wearing no shoes in a flight attendant uniform. She actually broke a world record for surviving the highest fall of 33,000 feet without a parachute sustaining injuries to her vertebrae, 2 broken legs, broken ribs and some other injuries.</p><p>Luckily She was able to survive because the accident caused a hole in the fuselage causing a suction force to occur. It would have sucked her out had she not been pinned down by a food cart that hit her. Vesna had been recently advised against that job because of her low blood pressure but that must have been what saved her heart from bursting on impact. She sustained some levels of amnesia causing her to forget the incident and soon was caught in the sky again, working.</p><p>She went on to live her life till she died in 2016. Making her certainly among the people who survived the impossible.</p><h2>2.&nbsp;<span><a href="https://www.science-a2z.com/olympian-paraglider-ewa-wisnierskas-tale-of-survival/2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ewa Wisnierska</a></span></h2><p><img data-attachment-id="2507" data-permalink="https://www.nowyouknowstuff.com/danger%e2%98%a0%ef%b8%8f/people-who-survived-the-impossible/attachment/ewa-wisnierska-meteoweb_com/" data-orig-file="https://www.nowyouknowstuff.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Ewa-Wisnierska-MeteoWeb_com.jpg" data-orig-size="720,480" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="Ewa-Wisnierska-MeteoWeb_com" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://www.nowyouknowstuff.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Ewa-Wisnierska-MeteoWeb_com-300x200.jpg" data-large-file="https://www.nowyouknowstuff.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Ewa-Wisnierska-MeteoWeb_com.jpg" loading="lazy" src="https://www.nowyouknowstuff.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Ewa-Wisnierska-MeteoWeb_com.jpg" alt="People who survived the impossible" width="720" height="480" srcset="https://www.nowyouknowstuff.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Ewa-Wisnierska-MeteoWeb_com.jpg 720w, https://www.nowyouknowstuff.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Ewa-Wisnierska-MeteoWeb_com-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" title="People who survived the impossible 3">You might want to cross off paragliding from your bucket list when after you’ve heard this chilling incident. In February 2007, Wisnierska was practicing for the paragliding championships in Australia when she flew under a storm cloud and was sucked into it. She was flown higher into the air at a breakneck speed of 20m/s in the midst of lightning flashes and hailstones the size of ping pong balls.</p><p>Soon She passed out but the winds didn’t call it quits as she was whisked to a height of more than 32,000ft (that’s 3,000 feet higher than the peak of mount Everest and almost the cruising altitude of a commercial jet). Eventually She woke up mid air and navigated herself to a nearby farm where she only suffered frostbite to her extremities.</p><p>To show you how lucky she was to survive, experts said that this kind of luck is needed to win 10 lottery tickets in a row.</p><h2>3.&nbsp;<a href="https://time.com/4550059/bear-attack-montana-todd-orr/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Todd Orr</a></h2><p><img data-attachment-id="2508" data-permalink="https://www.nowyouknowstuff.com/danger%e2%98%a0%ef%b8%8f/people-who-survived-the-impossible/attachment/todd-orr-man-survived-grizzly-bear-attack-twice/" data-orig-file="https://www.nowyouknowstuff.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/todd-orr-man-survived-grizzly-bear-attack-twice.jpg" data-orig-size="800,500" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="todd-orr-man-survived-grizzly-bear-attack-twice" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://www.nowyouknowstuff.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/todd-orr-man-survived-grizzly-bear-attack-twice-300x188.jpg" data-large-file="https://www.nowyouknowstuff.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/todd-orr-man-survived-grizzly-bear-attack-twice.jpg" loading="lazy" src="https://www.nowyouknowstuff.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/todd-orr-man-survived-grizzly-bear-attack-twice.jpg" alt="People who survived the impossible" width="800" height="500" srcset="https://www.nowyouknowstuff.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/todd-orr-man-survived-grizzly-bear-attack-twice.jpg 800w, https://www.nowyouknowstuff.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/todd-orr-man-survived-grizzly-bear-attack-twice-300x188.jpg 300w, https://www.nowyouknowstuff.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/todd-orr-man-survived-grizzly-bear-attack-twice-768x480.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" title="People who survived the impossible 4">Lucky enough to survive a grizzly bear attack? Big deal, try two attacks in thesame day.</p><p>On September 30, 2016, Todd went hiking in the forest of Montana when he stumbled upon a grizzly bear with her Cubs. Naturally, the motherly instincts of the bear kicked up and she attacked him.</p><p>Even though he was armed with pepper spray and was able to use it, the bear still gave him some injuries before running off due to the spray. He was about to get into his car when the bear came in for round 2, obviously to finish what she started.</p><p>She ran towards him, bit his shoulder and slashed one of his arms. Fortunately, Todd was able to remain calm and lay still, protecting his neck.&nbsp;</p><p>He received a few more hits before she left him, thinking he was dead, after which he got up and drove off to the hospital.

CT scan revealed that the heart had suffered an amazing 90° spin to the right. Despite suffering a punctured lung, ruptured spleen and broken ribs, he was still awake.</p><p>Doctors thought the force of the crash pushed his heart to the wrong direction but was later confirmed that it was the punctured lung that created a pocket of air that caused the heart to spin. The air was later drained out and the heart returned to the normal position in a day.</p><h2>5.&nbsp;<span><a href="http://paulrosolie.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Paul Rosolie</a></span></h2><p><img data-attachment-id="2510" data-permalink="https://www.nowyouknowstuff.com/danger%e2%98%a0%ef%b8%8f/people-who-survived-the-impossible/attachment/rs_600x600-141105150006-600-paul-rosolie-ananconda-ls-11514/" data-orig-file="https://www.nowyouknowstuff.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/rs_600x600-141105150006-600-Paul-Rosolie-ananconda.ls_.11514.jpg" data-orig-size="1080,1080" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="rs_600x600-141105150006-600-Paul-Rosolie-ananconda.ls.11514" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://www.nowyouknowstuff.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/rs_600x600-141105150006-600-Paul-Rosolie-ananconda.ls_.11514-300x300.jpg" data-large-file="https://www.nowyouknowstuff.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/rs_600x600-141105150006-600-Paul-Rosolie-ananconda.ls_.11514-1024x1024.jpg" loading="lazy" src="https://www.nowyouknowstuff.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/rs_600x600-141105150006-600-Paul-Rosolie-ananconda.ls_.11514.jpg" alt="People who survived the impossible" width="1080" height="1080" srcset="https://www.nowyouknowstuff.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/rs_600x600-141105150006-600-Paul-Rosolie-ananconda.ls_.11514.jpg 1080w, https://www.nowyouknowstuff.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/rs_600x600-141105150006-600-Paul-Rosolie-ananconda.ls_.11514-300x300.jpg 300w, https://www.nowyouknowstuff.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/rs_600x600-141105150006-600-Paul-Rosolie-ananconda.ls_.11514-1024x1024.jpg 1024w, https://www.nowyouknowstuff.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/rs_600x600-141105150006-600-Paul-Rosolie-ananconda.ls_.11514-150x150.jpg 150w, https://www.nowyouknowstuff.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/rs_600x600-141105150006-600-Paul-Rosolie-ananconda.ls_.11514-768x768.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1080px) 100vw, 1080px" title="People who survived the impossible 6">Wild life conservationist, Paul Rosolie approached a 20ft amazonian anaconda with the intention of getting swallowed and knowing how other animals in such situations feel.</p><div><p>He earlier informed viewers to stay tuned as he named the segment “eaten alive” <br>It was a very daring task but probably not as daring as calling the attention of thousands if not millions of viewers and then bailing at the last minute so he just had to do it</p><p>He rubbed himself in pig’s blood and got into a protective suit as he slowly allowed himself to be swallowed by the huge beast. <br>Snakes will find it hard to swallow a person because of the broadness of his shoulders so I’m guessing he went in first with his feet closely together.</p><p>Everything was going quite alright, people were taking pictures and were also, of course, videoing until he had to call it off when he heard his bones cracking. The anaconda was badly squeezing him and boy did it hurt, BAD.</p><p>The snake initially latched on to his right arm and then quickly coiled round him. He heard strange sounds as the snake opened her mouth and started swallowing from his helmet (I guess she did swallow him from the head despite his shoulder, must have been a REALLY huge snake)</p><p>He tried to move into a more comfortable position but the snake was just too strong. It’s a good thing he called it off because even though he had a snake proof suit, he could have been crushed in a matter of time.</p><p>I don’t know about you, but getting swallowed for pictures, videos and a livestream isn’t worth it.</p></div><h2>6. <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/amp/Health/man-impaled-air-hose-enjoying-inflated-reputation/story?id=13693534" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steven</a><span>&nbsp;<a href="https://abcnews.go.com/amp/Health/man-impaled-air-hose-enjoying-inflated-reputation/story?id=13693534" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mcormack</a></span></h2><p><img data-attachment-id="2511" data-permalink="https://www.nowyouknowstuff.com/danger%e2%98%a0%ef%b8%8f/people-who-survived-the-impossible/attachment/steven-dw-bayern-whakatane-jpg0/" data-orig-file="https://www.nowyouknowstuff.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Steven-DW-Bayern-Whakatane-jpg0.jpg" data-orig-size="1024,1001" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="Steven-DW-Bayern-Whakatane-jpg(0)" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://www.nowyouknowstuff.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Steven-DW-Bayern-Whakatane-jpg0-300x293.jpg" data-large-file="https://www.nowyouknowstuff.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Steven-DW-Bayern-Whakatane-jpg0.jpg" loading="lazy" src="https://www.nowyouknowstuff.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Steven-DW-Bayern-Whakatane-jpg0.jpg" alt="People who survived the impossible" width="1024" height="1001" srcset="https://www.nowyouknowstuff.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Steven-DW-Bayern-Whakatane-jpg0.jpg 1024w, https://www.nowyouknowstuff.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Steven-DW-Bayern-Whakatane-jpg0-300x293.jpg 300w, https://www.nowyouknowstuff.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Steven-DW-Bayern-Whakatane-jpg0-768x751.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="People who survived the impossible 7">Back in 2011, this truck driver was standing on the rigging between his truck and a trailer when one slip created a nasty chain reaction. He landed on a valve connecting the trucks brake to the compressed air supply causing it to Pierce through his Left butt and within seconds, air was released into his body in pressures of about 100PSI.</p><p>His horrified co-workers watched as he inflated to twice his size, turning him into a life sized balloon. While he screamed in agony, his co-workers managed to lift him off of the valve and place him to his side before the paramedics arrived.

<p>If you have a Cisco Meraki AP with an expired cloud license, its pretty much useless. However, if you have a RaspberryPi, some wires, and some patience you can pretty easily Flash <a href="https://openwrt.org/">OpenWRT</a> on Cisco Meraki. </p>
<p><em>Note : This voids your warranty and Meraki subscription so best done on decommissioned units that have not been updated in awhile. </em></p>
<h2>Things You’ll Need </h2>
<ol><li>Cisco Meraki MR33 AP (can be done on other models with serial pins) </li><li>RaspberryPi with GPIO Board + Monitor + Keyboard + Mouse </li><li>Three Pin-To-Pin jumper wires (can be salvaged from old IDE cables) </li><li>Ethernet Cable </li><li>Torx Screwdriver and a pry tool </li><li>A Laptop and this Google Drive <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1jJa8LzYnY830v3nBZdOgAk0YQK6OdbSS">Link</a> (contains the files we need) </li></ol>
<h2>Flash OpenWRT on Cisco Meraki </h2>
<p>First, remove the 4 screws (behind the rubber stoppers) on the grey underside of the AP, then pry it apart at the seams. </p>
<p><strong>Step 1 :</strong> There are 4 screws behind the rubber ‘feet’ on the grey side of the AP. Undo them, then pop the AP apart by using a plastic or metal knife. </p>
<figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://roamingviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image-1.png" alt="" width="374" height="578" srcset="https://roamingviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image-1.png 499w, https://roamingviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image-1-194x300.png 194w" sizes="(max-width: 374px) 85vw, 374px" data-old-src="//roamingviews.com/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif" data-src="https://roamingviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image-1.png" data-srcset="https://roamingviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image-1.png 499w, https://roamingviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image-1-194x300.png 194w"></figure>

<p><strong>Step 2 : </strong>On your RaspberryPi download all of the files in the Google Drive. Extract them with a ZIP tool, then put them in a folder. </p>
<figure><img loading="lazy" width="634" height="148" src="https://roamingviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image-2.png" alt="" srcset="https://roamingviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image-2.png 634w, https://roamingviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image-2-300x70.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" data-old-src="//roamingviews.com/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif" data-src="https://roamingviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image-2.png" data-srcset="https://roamingviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image-2.png 634w, https://roamingviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image-2-300x70.png 300w"></figure>
<p><strong>Step 3 : </strong>Enable Serial GPIO on the RaspberryPi by typing “raspi-config’ navigating to <strong>Interfaces -&gt; Serial -&gt; Prompt 1 Hit NO -&gt; Prompt 2 Hit YES</strong>-&gt; You will see a confirmation , hit <strong>OK -&gt; Hit Finish (bottom right)</strong></p>
<figure><img loading="lazy" width="639" height="413" src="https://roamingviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image-3.png" alt="" srcset="https://roamingviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image-3.png 639w, https://roamingviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image-3-300x194.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" data-old-src="//roamingviews.com/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif" data-src="https://roamingviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image-3.png" data-srcset="https://roamingviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image-3.png 639w, https://roamingviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image-3-300x194.png 300w"></figure>
<p>This will enable the Serial on the GPIO pins which run across the side of the raspberrypi , to figure out your serial interface d0 the following command :</p>
<figure><img loading="lazy" width="640" height="72" src="https://roamingviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image-4.png" alt="" srcset="https://roamingviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image-4.png 640w, https://roamingviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image-4-300x34.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" data-old-src="//roamingviews.com/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif" data-src="https://roamingviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image-4.png" data-srcset="https://roamingviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image-4.png 640w, https://roamingviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image-4-300x34.png 300w"></figure>
<p>Take note that we will use the ttyS0 interface </p>
<p><strong>Step 4 : </strong>Connect these GPIO serial pins on the RaspberryPi to 3 pins on the Meraki board. </p>

<p><span>D0 NOT connect anything to the pin with the white arrow on it.</span></p>
<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="748" src="https://roamingviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image-6-1024x748.png" alt="" srcset="https://roamingviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image-6-1024x748.png 1024w, https://roamingviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image-6-300x219.png 300w, https://roamingviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image-6-768x561.png 768w, https://roamingviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image-6.png 1154w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" data-old-src="//roamingviews.com/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif" data-src="https://roamingviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image-6-1024x748.png" data-srcset="https://roamingviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image-6-1024x748.png 1024w, https://roamingviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image-6-300x219.png 300w, https://roamingviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image-6-768x561.png 768w, https://roamingviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image-6.png 1154w"></figure>

<p><strong>Step 5 : </strong>Now Launch the flashing script with the following command , you need to add the name of your serial interface we enabled earlier with the –serial={interface path}. After the python file runs and you see “Uploading image” then plug the power into the AP to boot it , be careful not to let the serial wires move or shift. </p>
<p>If done correctly you should pretty instantly see the following output after booting the AP :</p>

<p><strong>Step 6 : </strong>Connect an Ethernet cord to your AP from a laptop or the Pi , set your interface IP to 192.168.1.2 and your gateway to 192.168.1.1 with a subnet mask of 255.255.255.0 and verify it works by pinging 192.168.1.1 , if you get a response. Now Upload OpenWRT to the AP via TFTP by hitting PUT :<br></p>
<figure><img loading="lazy" width="665" height="592" src="https://roamingviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image-8.png" alt="" srcset="https://roamingviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image-8.png 665w, https://roamingviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image-8-300x267.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" data-old-src="//roamingviews.com/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif" data-src="https://roamingviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image-8.png" data-srcset="https://roamingviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image-8.png 665w, https://roamingviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image-8-300x267.png 300w"></figure>
<p>The AP should now Reboot and after a minute , you can browse to http://192.168.1.1 and see the following or SSH to see OpenWRT! </p>

<p>This document is summarised in the table below. It shows the linear models underlying common parametric and “non-parametric” tests. Formulating all the tests in the same language highlights the many similarities between them.

<div id="the-simplicity-underlying-common-tests">

<p>Most of the common statistical models (t-test, correlation, ANOVA; chi-square, etc.) are special cases of linear models or a very close approximation. This beautiful simplicity means that there is less to learn. In particular, it all comes down to <span>\(y = a \cdot x + b\)</span> which most students know from highschool. Unfortunately, stats intro courses are usually taught as if each test is an independent tool, needlessly making life more complicated for students and teachers alike.</p>
<p>This needless complexity multiplies when students try to rote learn the parametric assumptions underlying each test separately rather than deducing them from the linear model.</p>
<p>For this reason, I think that teaching linear models first and foremost and <em>then</em> name-dropping the special cases along the way makes for an excellent teaching strategy, emphasizing <em>understanding</em> over rote learning. Since linear models are the same across frequentist, Bayesian, and permutation-based inferences, I’d argue that it’s better to start with modeling than p-values, type-1 errors, Bayes factors, or other inferences.</p>
<p>Concerning the teaching of <em>“non-parametric”</em> tests in intro-courses, I think that we can justify <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lie-to-children">lying-to-children</a> and teach “non-parametric”" tests as if they are merely ranked versions of the corresponding parametric tests. It is much better for students to think “ranks!” than to believe that you can magically throw away assumptions. Indeed, the Bayesian equivalents of “non-parametric”" tests implemented in <a href="https://jasp-stats.org/">JASP</a> <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.06941">literally just do (latent) ranking</a> and that’s it. For the frequentist “non-parametric”" tests considered here, this approach is highly accurate for N &gt; 15.</p>

<h3> Theory: As linear models</h3>
<p>Model: the recipe for <span>\(y\)</span> is a slope (<span>\(\beta_1\)</span>) times <span>\(x\)</span> plus an intercept (<span>\(\beta_0\)</span>, aka a straight line).</p>
<p><span>\(y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x \qquad \mathcal{H}_0: \beta_1 = 0\)</span></p>
<p>… which is a math-y way of writing the good old <span>\(y = ax + b\)</span> (here ordered as <span>\(y = b + ax\)</span>). In R we are lazy and write <code>y ~ 1 + x</code> which R reads like <code>y = 1*number + x*othernumber</code> and the task of t-tests, lm, etc., is simply to find the numbers that best predict <span>\(y\)</span>.</p>
<p>Either way you write it, it’s an intercept (<span>\(\beta_0\)</span>) and a slope (<span>\(\beta_1\)</span>) yielding a straight line:</p>
<div>
<pre><code># Fixed correlation
D_correlation = data.frame(MASS::mvrnorm(30, mu = c(0.9, 0.9), Sigma = matrix(c(1, 0.8, 1, 0.8), ncol = 2), empirical = TRUE))  # Correlated data

               lwd=2, aes(color="beta_0")) + 
  scale_color_manual(name=NULL, values=c("blue", "red"), labels=c(bquote(beta[0]*" (intercept)"), bquote(beta[1]*" (slope)")))

</div>
<p>This is often simply called a <strong>regression</strong> model which can be extended to <strong>multiple regression</strong> where there are several <span>\(\beta\)</span>s and on the right-hand side multiplied with the predictors. Everything below, from <a href="#t1">one-sample t-test</a> to <a href="#anova2">two-way ANOVA</a> are just special cases of this system. Nothing more, nothing less.</p>
<p>As the name implies, the <strong>Spearman rank correlation</strong> is a <strong>Pearson correlation</strong> on rank-transformed <span>\(x\)</span> and <span>\(y\)</span>:</p>
<p><span>\(rank(y) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \cdot rank(x) \qquad \mathcal{H}_0: \beta_1 = 0\)</span></p>
<p>I’ll introduce <a href="#rank">ranks</a> in a minute. For now, notice that the correlation coefficient of the linear model is identical to a “real” Pearson correlation, but p-values are an approximation which is is <a href="https://lindeloev.github.io/tests-as-linear/simulations/simulate_spearman.html">appropriate for samples greater than N=10 and almost perfect when N &gt; 20</a>.</p>
<p>Such a nice and non-mysterious equivalence that many students are left unaware of! Visualizing them side by side including data labels, we see this rank-transformation in action:</p>
<div>
<pre><code># Spearman intercept
intercept_spearman = coefficients(lm(rank(X2) ~ rank(X1), D_correlation))[1]

# Spearman plot
P_spearman = ggplot(D_correlation, aes(x=rank(X1), y=rank(X2))) +
  geom_smooth(method=lm, se=FALSE, lwd=2, aes(color='beta_1')) + 
  geom_text(aes(label=label_rank), nudge_y=1, size=3, color='dark gray') + 
  geom_segment(x=-100, xend=100, 
               y=intercept_spearman, yend=intercept_spearman, 
               lwd=2, aes(color='beta_0')) + 
  scale_color_manual(name=NULL, values=c("blue", "red"), labels=c(bquote(beta[0]*" (intercept)"), bquote(beta[1]*" (slope)")))

# Stich together using patchwork
(theme_axis(P_pearson, legend.position=c(0.5, 0.1)) + geom_text(aes(label=label_num), nudge_y=0.1, size=3, color='dark gray') + labs(title='         Pearson')) + (theme_axis(P_spearman, xlim=c(-7.5, 30), ylim=c(-7.5, 30), legend.position=c(0.5, 0.1)) + labs(title='         Spearman'))</code></pre>

<div id="rank">
<h3> Theory: rank-transformation</h3>
<p><code>rank</code> simply takes a list of numbers and “replace” them with the integers of their rank (1st smallest, 2nd smallest, 3rd smallest, etc.). So the result of the rank-transformation <code>rank(c(3.6, 3.4, -5.0, 8.2))</code> is <code>3, 2, 1, 4</code>. See that in the figure above?</p>
<p>A <em>signed</em> rank is the same, just where we rank according to absolute size first and then add in the sign second. So the signed rank here would be <code>2, 1, -3, 4</code>. Or in code:</p>
<pre><code>signed_rank = function(x) sign(x) * rank(abs(x))</code></pre>
<p>I hope I don’t offend anyone when I say that ranks are easy; yet it’s all you need to do to convert most parametric tests into their “non-parametric” counterparts! One interesting implication is that <em>many “non-parametric tests” are about as parametric as their parametric counterparts with means, standard deviations, homogeneity of variance, etc. - just on rank-transformed data</em>. That’s why I put “non-parametric” in quotation marks.</p>
</div>
<div id="r-code-pearson-correlation">
<h3> R code: Pearson correlation</h3>
<p>It couldn’t be much simpler to run these models in R. They yield identical <code>p</code> and <code>t</code>, but there’s a catch: <code>lm</code> gives you the <em>slope</em> and even though that is usually much more interpretable and informative than the <em>correlation coefficient</em> <em>r</em>, you may still want <em>r</em>. Luckily, the slope becomes <code>r</code> if <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> have identical standard deviations. For now, we will use <code>scale(x)</code> to make <span>\(SD(x) = 1.0\)</span> and <span>\(SD(y) = 1.0\)</span>:</p>
<pre><code>a = cor.test(y, x, method = "pearson") # Built-in
b = lm(y ~ 1 + x) # Equivalent linear model: y = Beta0*1 + Beta1*x
c = lm(scale(y) ~ 1 + scale(x))  # On scaled vars to recover r</code></pre><p>

I’m not diabetic or even prediabetic. But when I stumbled on the chance to wear a continuous glucose monitor (CGM) as part of a challenge partnered with Levels, I jumped on it. I’ve been conscious of blood sugar my whole life because I suffered from spells of hypoglycemia as a child.</span></p><p><span>Hypoglycemia is when your blood sugar drops below 70mg/dL. I still don’t know why it happened, but it wasn’t fun. When my glucose levels dropped too low, I’d experience cold sweats, lightheadedness, trembling hands, and an elevated heart rate. These symptoms were likely the result of my body releasing epinephrine (adrenaline) to stabilize my blood glucose.</span></p><p><span>Over the years, I started to pick up on which foods caused my blood sugar to crash. The biggest culprits were cereal for breakfast and sweet tea later in the day. Every time I ate a big bowl of cereal before school (usually Frosted Mini-Wheats or Honey Nut Cheerios), I would crash around 10:30 a.m. like clockwork. Sometimes the crashes were so bad that I thought I might pass out, so I’d call my mom to check me out of school.</span></p><p><img src="https://www.levelshealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Blake-Reichman-Profile_Picture-200x200.jpg" data-src="https://www.levelshealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Blake-Reichman-Profile_Picture-200x200.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="200" data-srcset="https://www.levelshealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Blake-Reichman-Profile_Picture-200x200.jpg 200w, https://www.levelshealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Blake-Reichman-Profile_Picture-400x400.jpg 400w, https://www.levelshealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Blake-Reichman-Profile_Picture.jpg 512w" data-sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" srcset="https://www.levelshealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Blake-Reichman-Profile_Picture-200x200.jpg 200w, https://www.levelshealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Blake-Reichman-Profile_Picture-400x400.jpg 400w, https://www.levelshealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Blake-Reichman-Profile_Picture.jpg 512w"></p><p><span>Experiencing low blood sugar not only made it hard to focus but was, quite frankly, a scary experience for someone who didn’t understand what was going on. After missing a few classes from these episodes, my mom decided it was time to change my diet.</span></p><p><span>I went from eating cereal in the mornings to eggs, bacon, and fruit (berries or avocado) and cut out the sweet tea (tough to do for a boy raised in Alabama). Once I made those changes, the crashes stopped, and I had energy throughout the day.</span></p><p><span>At the time, I didn’t fully understand why the switch worked, but I did understand even at a young age that consuming a bunch of carbs and sugar wasn’t good for me. Since then, I’ve become fascinated with maintaining a healthy lifestyle and finding ways to improve my health. My curiosity for seeking ways to optimize my diet is what eventually led me to put a CGM on my arm.</span></p><h2>The Challenge</h2><p><span>I first learned about the 28-day </span><a href="https://www.wearablechallenge.com/"><span>Wearable Challenge</span></a><span> from following </span><a href="https://twitter.com/jwmares"><span>Justin Mares</span></a><span> on Twitter. I’ve followed Justin for quite a while since he knew a lot about the health-and-wellness space after founding two health food companies, </span><a href="https://www.kettleandfire.com/"><span>Kettle &amp; Fire</span></a><span> and </span><a href="https://perfectketo.com/"><span>Perfect Keto</span></a><span>.</span></p><p><span>In October, Justin shared an </span><a href="https://twitter.com/jwmares/status/1315696415213936641"><span>interesting tweet</span></a><span> about a weight-loss challenge that only required participants to track their blood glucose with a </span><a href="https://www.levelshealth.com/"><span>Levels</span></a><span> CGM. After reading the tweet, I knew this was something I had to try. Even though the challenge focused on weight loss, I enrolled immediately because I wanted to experiment with a CGM to see how my body reacts to my diet.</span></p><p><span>The challenge required me to keep my glucose levels below 120mg/dL even after a meal. For every day I went over, I’d lose $25 (talk about having skin in the game). The challenge started with a three-day grace period, so I could experiment with my diet to see how it impacted my glucose without getting penalized.</span></p><p><span>(For context, according to the</span><a href="https://www.idf.org/component/attachments/attachments.html?id=728&amp;task=download"> <span>International Diabetes Federation (IDF) guidelines</span></a><span>, your glucose values are “normal” if they stay below 140mg/dL after meals and return to pre-meal levels within two to three hours. Since this is a challenge geared towards weight loss, the upper limit was set slightly lower.)</span></p><p><b>Related article: </b><a href="https://www.levelshealth.com/blog/what-should-my-glucose-levels-be-ultimate-guide"><b>What should your glucose levels be? Here’s the ultimate guide to healthy blood sugar ranges</b></a></p><p><span>To help stay in the target range, each member of the challenge had access to a WhatsApp group chat to support each other. The group chat was a place for members to share what diet was working well, vent their frustrations when they failed, and provide a positive environment for motivation and encouragement. This aspect was less useful for me (I ended up muting it after a few days) because my goals were different. Still, I could see how much other members appreciated the accountability and support.</span></p><h2>What I Learned</h2><p><span>Overall, I found the challenge to be a learning experience filled with joyful moments of self-confirmation, times of utter disappointment, and a few surprises in between.</span></p><h3>The Good</h3><p><span>The best news was discovering that my typical breakfast of three eggs, bacon, and half an avocado drizzled in olive oil caused almost no glycemic response, nor did my afternoon snack of raw almonds. The app showed that these foods consistently hit a perfect score. Since I eat these foods most often, it was comforting knowing that I had a strong foundation.</span></p><p><img src="https://www.levelshealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Breakfast-3.png" data-src="https://www.levelshealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Breakfast-3.png" alt="" width="400" height="600" data-srcset="https://www.levelshealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Breakfast-3.png 400w, https://www.levelshealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Breakfast-3-267x400.png 267w, https://www.levelshealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Breakfast-3-133x200.png 133w" data-sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" srcset="https://www.levelshealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Breakfast-3.png 400w, https://www.levelshealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Breakfast-3-267x400.png 267w, https://www.levelshealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Breakfast-3-133x200.png 133w"></p><p><span>The challenge also confirmed my belief that eating a low-carb paleo/keto-inspired diet consisting of mostly meat, vegetables, and healthy fats (olive oil, coconut oil, and butter/ghee) was optimal for maintaining consistent glucose levels.</span></p><p><img src="https://www.levelshealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Almonds-3.png" data-src="https://www.levelshealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Almonds-3.png" alt="" width="350" height="500" data-srcset="https://www.levelshealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Almonds-3.png 350w, https://www.levelshealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Almonds-3-280x400.png 280w, https://www.levelshealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Almonds-3-140x200.png 140w" data-sizes="(max-width: 350px) 100vw, 350px" srcset="https://www.levelshealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Almonds-3.png 350w, https://www.levelshealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Almonds-3-280x400.png 280w, https://www.levelshealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Almonds-3-140x200.png 140w"></p><p><span>Over the past four years, I’ve made a conscious effort to cook meals that avoid simple carbs, vegetable oils, and sweeteners, and it felt really good knowing I’d been making the right choices.</span></p><h3>The Not-So-Good</h3><p><span>The foods with the most considerable impact on my blood sugar were white rice and craft beer, although I can’t say I was surprised. Unfortunately, I love both of these things (so long Chipotle burrito bowls). It was disappointing to finally have to stare down the truth instead of continuing to live in willful ignorance.</span></p><p><img src="https://www.levelshealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Chipotle-1.png" data-src="https://www.levelshealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Chipotle-1.png" alt="" width="350" height="500" data-srcset="https://www.levelshealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Chipotle-1.png 350w, https://www.levelshealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Chipotle-1-280x400.png 280w, https://www.levelshealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Chipotle-1-140x200.png 140w" data-sizes="(max-width: 350px) 100vw, 350px" srcset="https://www.levelshealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Chipotle-1.png 350w, https://www.levelshealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Chipotle-1-280x400.png 280w, https://www.levelshealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Chipotle-1-140x200.png 140w"></p><p><span>I was also disappointed to learn how much sweet potato spikes my blood sugar. I knew sweet potatoes had a lower </span><a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/glycemic-index-and-glycemic-load-for-100-foods"><span>glycemic index (GI)</span></a><span> than regular potatoes, but they still pushed me over the limit. I plan to keep them in my diet but will be more conscious about how often I eat them.</span></p><h3>The Surprising</h3><p><span>The biggest surprise of the challenge was discovering that quality tequila (G4 Reposado) had almost no effect on my blood sugar. Tequila that is 100% agave has zero carbs because of the distillation process (an average craft IPA has around 13g of carbs). Since beer is my usual go-to if I want a drink, I was happy to learn there was a healthier substitute I already enjoyed.</span></p><p><span>I also recognize I need to be careful here. Just because I didn’t experience a glucose spike doesn’t mean I didn’t have a biological response. </span><a href="https://academic.oup.com/ajcn/article/85/6/1545/4632987"><span>Research suggests</span></a><span> that alcohol decreases the liver’s ability to make new glucose, so it can trigger hypoglycemia, especially if you’re fasting or in a ketogenic state.</span></p><p><b>Related article: </b><a href="https://www.levelshealth.com/blog/alcohol-and-metabolic-fitness"><b>What does alcohol do to my glucose levels?</b></a></p><p><span>Another big surprise was discovering that my glucose levels aren’t just impacted by <em>what</em> I eat but also <em>when</em> I eat. I confirmed this because I meal prep twice a week to save time by eating the same meal multiple days in a row. (You may find that boring; I find it efficient.)</span></p><p><span>Eating the same thing for lunch and dinner on several challenge days was great for understanding how my body responds to food at different times of the day. All else being equal, my glucose spikes more after dinner than it does for lunch—sometimes by as much as 20mg/dL!</span></p><p><span>Even more surprising was noticing how little change there was from eating the same meal from day to day, but then having a large variance between lunch and dinner. I’m sure there’s a reason why, but I couldn’t tease a convincing explanation out of the data.</span></p><p><img src="https://www.levelshealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Nov-11-1.png" data-src="https://www.levelshealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Nov-11-1.png" alt="" width="350" height="500" data-srcset="https://www.levelshealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Nov-11-1.png 350w, https://www.levelshealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Nov-11-1-280x400.png 280w, https://www.levelshealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Nov-11-1-140x200.png 140w" data-sizes="(max-width: 350px) 100vw, 350px" srcset="https://www.levelshealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Nov-11-1.png 350w, https://www.levelshealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Nov-11-1-280x400.png 280w, https://www.levelshealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Nov-11-1-140x200.png 140w"></p><h2>What’s Changed</h2><p><span>Since the challenge ended, I’ve made a few adjustments to my diet. I’m not one to make radical changes (like cutting out a particular food from my diet forever), but now I’m more careful when I still want to splurge. Here are some of the changes I’ve made:</span></p><ul><li aria-level="1"><span>If I’m going to drink, I opt for quality spirits (neat or on the rocks) over craft beer or cocktails loaded with sugar.</span></li><li aria-level="1"><span>I’ve reconsidered the idea of a cheat day. I still plan on enjoying the occasional night of pizza and beer or tacos and margaritas, but a cheat day isn’t just a day. Now that I’m aware that the effects of an unhealthy meal can last for 2-3 days, I better make sure that the meal is worth it.</span></li><li aria-level="1"><span>I need to avoid any sweetened beverage, no matter how “healthy.”&nbsp; Smoothies, sweetened kombucha, and sweetened coffee wrecked my glucose levels, even though they’re often touted as healthy choices. Better to eat my sweets after a hearty meal than to drink them.</span></li><li aria-level="1"><span>I’m now more conscious of what I order when I eat out. For example, I opt for the salad at Chipotle instead of the burrito bowl. I’ve also switched to eating more sashimi instead of sushi to avoid eating as much rice.</span></li></ul><p><span>Even though the challenge only lasted 28 days, I learned more about my diet and lifestyle in those four weeks than I had from any previous blood test or book on dieting. The challenge confirmed that I already eat a healthy diet, but I need to make a few changes to ensure a healthy life for decades to come.</span></p><p><em><span>To learn more about the 28-day </span><a href="https://www.wearablechallenge.com/"><span>Wearable Challenge</span></a><span><a href="https://www.wearablechallenge.com/">, click here</a>.</span></em></p><p><em>Adapted from an original post <a href="https://lawsonblake.com/continuous-glucose-monitoring-levels-health/">here</a>.&nbsp;</em></p></div></div></div></section><section id="blog-single-content-related" data-ani-anchor=""></section></main>         </div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text"><p><img src="https://crystal-lang.org/assets/media/crystal_logo.svg" alt="Crystal Logo"></p>
<p>It's been more than three years since I've been hooked into Crystal Lang. For
those who don't know, Crystal promises to be able to write high-level code,
borrowing syntax from Ruby while adding strongly-typed yet inferred parameters
and avoiding the null exception problem. It also provides a complete and powerful <em>stdlib</em> and uses concepts from new generation languages like Go Lang. </p>
<p>Oh, and a powerful on-compile time macro system making runtime reflection obsolete! </p>
<p>Did it fulfill its promises? Yes. At some costs.</p>
<p>I started developing in Crystal Lang out of curiosity and pleasure, as I thought
this is a fun language to work with. 
Then I challenged myself to see what I was able to write, and it ended up with <em><a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/anykeyh/clear">Clear</a></em>, an ORM I've built from scratch.</p>
<p>Eventually, I started working on a booking platform. Getting free hands on the technical side, I decided to design the backend in Crystal. </p>
<p>Nine months later and an app finished, I can give some insight about using Crystal in a professional environment; the <strong>good</strong>, the <strong>bad</strong>, and the <strong>ugly</strong>, and how to develop an app in a language that is still considered confidential and in a pre-release state.</p>
<h2 id="the-good">The good</h2>
<p>Crystal kept its promise in being a very expressive language. It allowed me to
write clean high-level business code, allowing to lower the gap between clients
requirement and code syntax. Big <em>oui</em> here!</p>
<pre><code>
post <span>"/contact_us"</span> <span>do</span> <span>|env|</span>
  form = ContactUsForm.from_json(env.request.body.not_nil!)
  Mail.deliver ContactUsEmail.new(form.email, form.title, form.message)
<span>end</span>
</code></pre>
<p>The customer had some very complex rules when bookings were moved or canceled,
and I was aware that two teams of developers had given up on this project prior
to my work. </p>
<p>I decided to go for a Controller - Business Logic - Model 3-tier on
the backend and keep the View and Presentation on the frontend (using Typescript
and MithrilJS). </p>
<p>Because Crystal is strongly typed, the work to be done on spec
and coverage of the code is strongly reduced, in comparison to a Ruby or Python
code. </p>
<p>80% of the bugs occurring in those script languages have their root cause
laying in lose parameter type or nullable type. Both cases are covered at
compile time in Crystal. Basically, I wrote only 120 test cases on this
application, covering the different business cases of the user. In Ruby, for an
application of this scale, I would be around 250 to 400 tests.</p>
<p>At release, the application faced very few bugs. 
Some edges case we forgot with the client were failing. But so far, the compiler did an excellent job in preventing most of the bugs. </p>
<p>Because the language is compiled, it is wonderful to use within a Kubernetes cluster: The app starts in less than 200ms, allowing horizontal scaling, health-check and automatic restart of the app much more convenient than a big Rails application. </p>
<p>Memory usage is relatively low, peeking to ~250Mb and I never experienced any memory leak whatsoever. </p>
<p>And it runs fast. Really fast. For those who used to work with Rails, Django, or Laravel,
we are comparing snails with a cheetah there. </p>
<p>Actually, it runs so fast that I decided to do some complex data aggregation and transformation directly in Crystal instead of PostgreSQL.</p>
<h2 id="the-bad">The bad</h2>
<p>The major challenge I faced in keeping a good pace and being productive was the
compilation time. It takes around 20 seconds to compile/run spec on my i7 8750H.
We are talking of an app with ~9000 LOC, few shards (library), for a grand total
of probably less than 100k LOC. This compilation time is mostly due to the very
dynamic nature of Crystal lang, the work needed to be done at
compile-time  (<em> macro and type inference being the culprits </em>) , and the lack of
incremental compilation at the time of writing this article. 20 seconds seems
not much, but during a whole working day, it builds-up leading to a
non-negligible loss of productivity. For the defense of the language, the
problem is also at the developer level: it is just enough to lose focus, browse
few tabs on Reddit, check a video on Youtube, and can - too often! -  snowball
to minutes or more. Guilty I am!</p>
<p>Another challenge was the usage of the young library ecosystem. The language is
still confidential and some shards  (the name which is given to libraries in the Crystal
world) are not working with the latest version of Crystal, or lack of support,
as some authors just gave up on the language or have little to no time to
maintain them. 
I can't complain, as I am too responsible for this, as I gave little maintenance the last months over <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/anykeyh/clear">Clear ORM</a>.</p>
<h2 id="the-ugly">The ugly?</h2>
<p>During development, I faced a few but worrying bugs, where the compiler was
literally crashing without any idea of where the problem came from. It also
happens that using some complex features of the language, like inheriting from
generic classes could lead to segfault during execution after a while. Issues
were raised and the Crystal Lang team fixed everything on short notice.</p>
<p>Since now, I'm not able to build the backend using <code>--release</code> flag due to
segfault at compile time. 
This is not a problem <em>per se</em>, as even without the optimization, the backend spends like 90% of its time waiting for PostgreSQL. </p>
<p>I still get a random crash of the application I gave up fixing for now.
Basically, the app can't access anymore to the PostgreSQL database after a
while.
This occurs on average between 3 to 30 days of running; I defined an
<code>/healthcheck</code> endpoint throwing a simple <code>SELECT 1</code>; to check the connection, called each second by Kubernetes.</p>
<p>With multiple pods redundancy, and thanks to low
memory foot-print and quick start-up time, pods defaulted got evicted and
recreated in a matter of seconds.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p><strong>If I did this app using Rails, would have I been more productive?</strong></p>
<p>It's hard to say, as I spent quite a lot of time debugging, improving, and
maintaining Clear ORM within the scope of this project. I think the
productivity difference would have been negligible.</p>
<p>What you would win by having a strict compiler avoiding your hours of debugging 
and specs definition, you lose by the compile-time, the need to rewrite some 
basic functionality you could get via gems. </p>
<p><strong>Would I recommend people using Crystal?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, if:</p>
<ul>
<li>You are aware that something might break, as the ecosystem is still young.</li>
</ul>
<p>Avoiding monolithic application patterns will certainly reduce the compile-time
problems. Having micro-service architecture is a must-have if you want to
develop with Crystal, as each service will take much less time to compile, test
and deploy. </p>
<p>The low memory footprint and fast execution time fit perfectly with
this architecture. If you come from the Ruby world, you will feel at ease with
the syntax but will have to learn new design patterns of face issues with
compile-time or overly complex macro/code.
A common mistake is to try to use open hash, JSON, or collection to realize too late that strongly typed language doesn't like open structures</p>
<p><strong>Compared to Go Lang or Rust, how do Crystal fits?</strong> </p>
<p>Go Lang is very dull and <em>feels</em> austere in my opinion. It's not a bad
technology, but it feels not enough magical for my personal taste.
Rust is great but it remains less elegant to write business code with it. 
The magic Rust does with the memory still adds a burden in terms of readability,
with reference, lifecycle, and other symbols polluting the essence of the code
in my opinion. </p>
<p>Knowing that the Crystal Lang team is aware of most of the
problems above and working hard to release the v1.0 of the language, I'm
confident the language will know a bright future and all the traction it merits.</p>

			<p>Note: <em>I wrote a quite complete article on the Zen but for some reason it went down in seo history. I am tired seeing people write ‘in-depth’ article with commentaries from the top of their head and materials they pulled out of their pockets. I’m publishing the article in here.  The commentary part is built from the sayings of Brett Cannon, Guido, Chris Angelico, Nick Coghlan, Raymond Hettinger &amp; co. Warning: read only if you are a fan of Python. Last notes: I do hope learners will get a great glimpse of how the Zen can help them structure their code and give them better insight and foresight. It’s a documentation  of how practically the Zen is applied in Python decisions.</em></p>

<li>Zen, Strunk and White</li>
<li>Master Tim Showers his Blessings</li>
<li>Authentic Commentary</li>
</ul>
<p>The Zen of Python saw light for the first time in 1999. It’s one of the many aspects that adds to the awesomeness of Python. It’s a set of expressions which corners the spirit of the language. It was enounced by Tim Peters, a reputable software engineer, master Pythonista and Python’s ‘most prolific and tenacious core developer’ in the words of none other than Guido [18]. This article bases itself mostly on the saying of core devs and highly reputable members. It makes a great gift to all those interested in the history of the sysadmin script which took the world by (pleasent) surprise.</p>
<p><img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1598545343242-89b4c263a343?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;ixid=eyJhcHBfaWQiOjEyMDd9&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=750&amp;q=80" alt="" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%200%200'%3E%3C/svg%3E"></p>

<p>The way the Zen came about was unique. It was a reflection from the unknown Patrick Phalen about the Python feel [1]:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  … the more I use<br>
  and learn about the language, the more I find myself appreciating the<br>
  nice balance and heft Guido gave to it. Yet there doesn’t seem to be a<br>
  single document that sums up that “aesthetic,” but rather it<br>
  tends to appear piecemeal, over time, mostly in the Wisdom of Chairman Tim.
</p></blockquote>
<p>It was a call to infuse the Python spirit into aliens from Perl Land and beyond. It requested some 10 to 20 lines which sums up the Python view</p>
<blockquote><p>
  Would both Guido and TIm Peters be willing to collaborate on a short<br>
  paper — call it “The Python Way” for lack of a better title — which<br>
  sets out the 10-20 prescriptives they might offer to those who come to<br>
  Python from other languages and immediately want to find a way to bend<br>
  it into uncomfortable positions — (implement closures, etc.).
</p></blockquote>
<p>It was a request to prevent Pythonistas from falling into the error of campaigning for changing the language. It advocated for imbuing yourself with the language’s flow and change your ways and views instead of the other way round. In the original mail, it quoted Fredrik Lundh as saying “sure looks like the ‘community’ thinks that changing the<br>
language is more important that using it…” [5]. Patrick clarifies:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  What I have in mind is sort of a very brief Strunk-&amp;-White-like<br>
  “Elements of Style” for Python, which suggests fundamental idiomatic<br>
  recommendations for operating within the spirit of the language. A<br>
  distillation of Python Zen is what I’m talking about — something to go<br>
  off and contemplate when the “fix Python now” decibels become a bit<br>
  much.
</p></blockquote>

<p>The Zen school lays out hints and guidelines. You understand by your own exercise and by the company of someone seasoned in the craft</p>
<blockquote><p>
  it de-emphasizes mere knowledge of sutras and doctrine and favors direct understanding through spiritual practice and interaction with an accomplished teacher or Master.[2]
</p></blockquote>
<p>The Zen was a request to help Python people achieve the Python state of mind so that your code resonates well with the structure behind, conveying in the process the associated beauty, elegance and finesse. Those guidelines if well impregnated would make your code revered whithin the circle of true monks.</p>
<p>But, curiously enough, Tim tells [19]:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  If I were to change anything, I’d drop the reference to “Zen”.  That wasn’t<br>
  part of the original, and was added by someone else.
</p></blockquote>
<p>In other words, the title is not from the author [23]</p>
<p>Strunk &amp; White is the name of two people, viz William Strunk and Elwyn Brooks White. Strunk wrote <em>The Elements of Style</em>, acclaimed by the Times as one of the most influencial books since 1923 [3]. White who was Strunk’s student and reviser after the professor’s death describes the book as:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  a forty-three page summation of the case<br>
  for cleanliness, accuracy, and brevity in the use of English [4]
</p></blockquote>
<p>The effect of the book is described below, he being Strunk:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  he omitted so<br>
  many needless words, and omitted them so forcibly and with such eagerness and obvious<br>
  relish, that he often seemed in the position of having shortchanged himself — a man left<br>
  with nothing more to say yet with time to fill, a radio prophet who had out-distanced the<br>
  clock. Will Strunk got out of this predicament by a simple trick: he uttered every sentence<br>
  three times
</p></blockquote>
<p>One effect of applying the Zen would then also be lighter code files.</p>

<p>Master Tim heard the plea, approved the demand and responded accordingly [6]</p>
<blockquote><p>
  Clearly a job for Guido alone — although I doubt it’s one he’ll take on<br>
  (fwiw, I wish he would too!).  Here’s the outline he would start from,<br>
  though <wink>:
</wink></p></blockquote>
<pre><code>Beautiful is better than ugly.
Explicit is better than implicit.
Simple is better than complex.
Complex is better than complicated.
Flat is better than nested.
Sparse is better than dense.
Readability counts.
Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.
Although practicality beats purity.
Errors should never pass silently.
Unless explicitly silenced.
In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.
There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.
Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.
Now is better than never.
Although never is often better than *right* now.
If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.
If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.
Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!
</code></pre>
<p>The 20th was left for Guido to fill in:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  There you go:  20 Pythonic Fec^H^H^HTheses on the nose, counting the one I’m<br>
  leaving for Guido to fill in.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Venerable Tim shares exactly how the lines came about [15]:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  It was a throwaway python-list post. But like all great triumphs of literature, it was written during commercials breaks while watching professional wrestling on TV, and munching on a ham sandwich. All true!
</p></blockquote>
<p>Yet, the author is emphatical: It’s complete and more than meets the demand [6]:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  If the answer to <em>any</em> Python design issue<br>
  isn’t obvious after reading those — well, I just give up <wink>.
</wink></p></blockquote>
<p>The above also reveals the purpose of the Zen: To address design issues. And it’s not a simple matter. Guido says [18]:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  In many ways, the design philosophy I used when creating Python is probably one of the main reasons for its ultimate success.
</p></blockquote>
<p>The Zen only gives the outlines, in contrast to Strunk and White which gives explanations and examples in addition. Thus the need for commentaries. These help the non-initiated without being a replacement for the company of the bright minds.</p>
<p>In a time of fluctuating and steered standards, the reference in the actual PEP8 document to Strunk and White in the usage of the English language caused a bitter, ugly and messy thread [7]. It caused some of the best people of the community to forego following  python-list [8], a casual reminder that being too open without limit hurts.</p>
<p><img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1593297372323-2ba78409d0b1?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=750&amp;q=80" alt="" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%200%200'%3E%3C/svg%3E"></p>

<p>The Zen has become an important piece of the Python programming language. If you don’t know the Zen, you won’t strike the right chord to communicate with the community. Raymond Hettinger advises:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  Before creating more tracker items, please take time to learn about how Python’s history, how it is used, and its cultural norms.  In particular, read the Zen of Python, consider what is meant by duck-typing, what is meant by “a consenting adults language”, what is meant by over-specification, etc.  Python is quite different from Java in this regard. [13]
</p></blockquote>
<p>There’s also a practical aspect to it. It’s popular because it works [14]. It’s the golden guiding principle in pretty much everything Python.</p>
<p>Finally are the Zen points rules? What are they really. Many people take the Zen for rules. The ‘most opinionated linter ever’ at one time actually included the Zen to back their views [9]. It was situations like these which prompted me to write: The Zen Of Python Is A Joke And Here Is Why [10]. It was nice enough for Michael Kennedy and Brian Okken to call it a ‘must read’ on PythonBytes [11].</p>
<p>According to Nick Coghlan, the Zen gives you the idea, not everything [12]:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  This<br>
  challenge is reflected in the fact that the Zen of Python is<br>
  deliberately self-contradictory, as it articulates competing design<br>
  principles to take into consideration, rather than being able to<br>
  provide ironclad rules that avoid the need for human judgement in<br>
  determining which of those design guidelines are most salient in any<br>
  given situation.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Self contradiction is also coincidentally, one of the criticised aspect of Strunk and White [17].<br>
The Zen also goes beyond coding, such as shaping the thought pattern of features [12]:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  The thing we work toward as core developers, and aspiring core<br>
  developers, is good design intuition that aligns with the Zen of<br>
  Python. That doesn’t mean we’re all going to be able to perfectly<br>
  articulate that intuition in every case, and even when we can, those<br>
  explanations are themselves generally going to be backed by intuition<br>
  rather than rigorous scientific research.
</p></blockquote>
<p>If ever i myself would have added a 20th one it would have been: “Use your judgement.”. But Nick illustrated it better.</p>
<p>As for the famous <code>import this</code> command, it was Barry Warsaw’s pick. He sneaked it in a this.py in 2001 along with the ROT13 obfuscation [16]. He also mentionned that it was a time ‘when the Python community had a sense of humor’.</p>

<p>Now the time is ripe to see what the Zen actually means. But before we should know that whatever the words<br>
and concepts mean in the Zen is not …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div class="page"><h2>Intro</h2><p>People use computer simulations to both understand the world and design for it. Those who need to know where a satellite will be at some future time build simulations of the forces acting on the satellite and propagate its motion from some known location and velocity. Those who design robots create simulations of the environments their robots will experience in order to test how the robots make decisions and move. And those designing power plants simulate weather, energy demand, and system failures to determine the best design for a range of conditions and uncertainty.</p><p>However, despite the importance and widespread applicability, few receive education on the subject. The best information is scattered in places one might not know to look, and even most simulation textbooks are narrowly targeted to specific applications or tools. The inevitable result is that many simulations suffer from basic problems that have easy solutions.</p><p>This article will set out the critical aspects of building good simulations — that is, simulations that are accurate, easy to develop and analyze, and fast. The first sections deal with how a simulation evolves over time, as this is the core of any simulation. Further sections deal with details that make simulations easier to develop, faster, and applicable to a large number of variations. The target audience is engineers, scientists, and programmers, whether new to creating simulations or experienced. A tiny amount of vector math and calculus is assumed, making this text accessible to first- and second-year undergraduates. By the end, the reader should be able to begin building quality simulations, avoid common pitfalls, communicate the reasons for their decisions to peers, and know where to look for additional resources on specific topics and for the mathematical rigor behind it all.</p><p>We'll start with the motivation for understanding the core of how systems evolve over time.</p><h2 id="TToDt">From \(t\) to \(t+\Delta t\)</h2><p>Let’s get started with a really basic example. Let’s say we have a little moon orbiting a big planet. At some time, we know its position and velocity, and from this we want to simulate the future trajectory.</p><figure><img src="http://www.anuncommonlab.com/articles/how-simulations-work/img/moon_illustration.png"><figcaption>Planet and moon</figcaption></figure><p>We know the planet pulls on the moon with gravity, so the moon’s acceleration at any point in time is:</p><p>$$\vec{a}(t) = -\frac{GM}{r(t)^2} \hat{\vec{r}}(t)$$</p><p>Here, \(\vec{a}(t)\) is the acceleration vector, \(\vec{r}(t)\) is the position of the moon with respect to the center of mass of the planet, \(\hat{\vec{r}}\) denotes a unit vector in the direction of \(\vec{r}\), \(r\) denotes the magnitude of \(\vec{r}\), and \(GM\) is the gravitational constant of the planet (remember high school?). Let’s ignore all other forces that might act on the moon for now, since this is overwhelmingly the biggest. How do we turn this into a simulator? It might seem obvious: if we know \(\vec{r}(t)\) and \(\vec{v}(t)\) for some \(t\), then at some time later, \(t + \Delta t\), if \(\vec{v}\) and \(\vec{a}\) are nearly constant across this \(\Delta t\), we would have:</p><p>$$\vec{v}(t + \Delta t) \approx \vec{v}(t) + \vec{a}(t) \Delta t$$
$$\vec{r}(t + \Delta t) \approx \vec{r}(t) + \vec{v}(t) \Delta t + \frac{1}{2} \vec{a}(t) \Delta t^2$$</p><p>Perhaps by taking a series of small \(\Delta t\) and updating the position and velocity along the way, we'll generate the future trajectory. That certainly seems easy enough, so let's try it out. We'll pick a moon in a circular orbit about the planet. It has a period, \(T\), of 30 time units (we can call them days, but it doesn't really matter) and is located at 1 distance unit from the planet. Since it's a circular orbit, the velocity has magnitude of \(2 \pi / T\) and is perpendicular to the vector from the planet to the moon. Finally, \(GM = \left(\frac{2\pi}{T}\right)^2\). We'll take a series of time steps, each \(\Delta t\) in length. Let's use \(\Delta t\) = 1 time unit, so there should be 30 time steps in the orbit, bringing the moon exactly back to where it started. Here are the results using the “multiply by \(\Delta t\)” method above, plotted on top of the actual future trajectory.</p><figure><img src="http://www.anuncommonlab.com/articles/how-simulations-work/img/moon2.png"><figcaption>Initial simulation</figcaption></figure><p>It's not a very good circle. What went wrong?</p><p>Let's zoom in on the very first time step. Note that as the moon moves, the acceleration should change to always point towards the planet, but since we've assumed the acceleration is constant across \(\Delta t\), the acceleration in this step is always to the left in this figure. This doesn't affect the position all that much, but look at the velocity compared to the true velocity (since this system has a closed form solution, we can compare to an exact value for truth). The stepped velocity wasn't “pulled back” towards the planet enough (since it always pulled left). The result is that the moon is now going a little too fast and to the outside of the true trajectory. This image is not to scale so that we might better see the small difference in the two velocities at the upper left.</p><figure><img src="http://www.anuncommonlab.com/articles/how-simulations-work/img/moon1.png"><figcaption>First time step</figcaption></figure><p>As this continues, the velocity will always have a systematic error, leaning to the outside with every step. The error builds up rapidly, and so our simulated trajectory is not useful. Of course, we used a really big time step. Only 30 time steps for the whole trajectory? That seems ambitious. Let's cut the time step down by a factor of 2. And then by another factor of 2. And then again, again, again, and again.</p><figure><img src="http://www.anuncommonlab.com/articles/how-simulations-work/img/moon3.png"><figcaption>Multiple time steps</figcaption></figure><p>With our smallest time step above we're now taking 1920 time steps, and still the error is huge (given that these are planets).</p><p>Now let's fix it. Note that the stepped trajectory is always to the outside, no matter how small the time step. What if we used some method of stepping that wouldn't have this outward tendency? Something that would take a step, see that the new acceleration is significantly different from the acceleration of the previous step, and figure out what the acceleration was across the time step? Fortunately, some great mathematicians have figured out excellent, all-purpose ways to do this. For example, applying one of the most common and all-purpose methods (it's not tailored to orbits in any way), we can achieve less error than our most precise time step above with only 11 steps. Yes, 11. These are plotted as dots on top of the true trajectory below. Let's find out how.</p><figure><img src="http://www.anuncommonlab.com/articles/how-simulations-work/img/moon4.png"><figcaption>Multiple time steps with a much better solution</figcaption></figure><h2 id="ODEs">Ordinary Differential Equations</h2><p>First, we need to establish what types of things we're going to propagate. When we have systems with some <dfn>state</dfn> (like position and velocity) at some time and we calculate the derivatives of that state (velocity and acceleration for the example) at that time, we call this an <dfn>ordinary differential equation</dfn> (ODE) (and when we're dealing with motion, we call this the <dfn>equation of motion</dfn>). We usually stick all of the parts of the state together into a column matrix and call it the <dfn>state vector</dfn>.</p><p>$$ x(t) = \begin{bmatrix} \vec{r}(t) \\ \vec{v}(t) \end{bmatrix}$$</p><p>Then we have this for the time derivative:</p><p>$$ \frac{d x(t)}{dt} \equiv \dot{x}(t) = \begin{bmatrix} \vec{v}(t) \\ \vec{a}(t) \end{bmatrix}$$</p><p>Then we describe the ODE something like this:</p><p>$$ \dot{x}(t) = f(t, x(t))$$
which just states that the derivatives depend on time and the current state and nothing else. It's also common to drop the explicit dependence on time, because it's generally understood. For our example, we have:
$$ \dot{x} = f(x) = \begin{bmatrix} \vec{v} \\ -\frac{GM}{r^2} \hat{\vec{r}} \end{bmatrix} $$</p><p>When we're keeping track of position by simulating its acceleration, it's a <dfn>second-order system</dfn>, because acceleration is the second-derivative of position. However, in terms of the state vector, \(x\), it's a <dfn>first-order system</dfn> (we calculate \(\dot{x}\) and not \(\ddot{x}\)). This can cause confusion, so we should just remember that the system is ultimately second-order, and we're just conveniently packaging up everything into \(x\) so as to use first-order techniques on \(x\).</p><p>In general, \(f(x)\) is our model of something, which might be nonlinear and even stochastic. The only assumption we make about the whole system is that it's differentiable (smooth-ish). It probably doesn't have a closed-form solution or we'd use the closed-form solution instead of simulating (our circular orbit of course has a closed-form solution, but that's just so that we can compare our simulation to something exact).</p><p>We'll talk about other types of systems (things that aren't ODEs) later. For now, this gives us plenty of great material since a plethora of physical systems are described as ODEs that boil down to \(\dot{x} = f(x)\), such as equations of motion, chemical reactions, thermodynamics, population growth, etc. Having a generic framework to describe these systems therefore lets us describe the solvers in a generic way, making them applicable to a great number of different problems.</p><h2 id="FixedStep">Fixed-Step Solvers</h2><p>In the orbit example, we held the acceleration constant across the time step, and this ultimately created a systemic bias to one side. Of course, we could easily have seen that the acceleration wasn't constant across the time step. For instance, we could have propagated by one time step, re-calculated the acceleration, and used this updated value to determine how the acceleration had changed across the time step, allowing us to revise the step. Drawing from this motivation, an excellent solution was created by Carl Runge and Martin Wilhelm Kutta a long while back. They proposed taking a series of small steps forward, using the derivatives along the way to determine the effective derivatives across the entire time step in such a way that the errors could be made very, very small.</p><h3>Runge-Kutta Fourth Order Method</h3><p>The most common Runge-Kutta method is known as “the” fourth order method, and we'll call it RK4. It involves calculating the derivatives four times like so:</p><ol><li>First, calculate the derivative at \(t\), 
$$ k_1 = f(t, x(t)) $$</li><li>Form an intermediate update of the state, 
$$ x(t + \frac{1}{2} …</li></ol></div></div>

<hr>

<p>Just yesterday, I released my <a href="https://github.com/makeworld-the-better-one/dither">dithering library</a>, written in Go.
It’s the product of many hours of research, experimentation, and refactoring. I’m
excited that it’s finally out, and to see what people create with it. Personally I’d like to create a CLI dithering
tool at some point that uses it.</p>

<p>Creating this library required research into the different algorithms for dithering, and how to implement them.
Unfortunately, not all of that knowledge is easily found. It’s spread across blog posts, Wikipedia pages without
citations, old books, and code comments. Recently, Surma wrote an article called
<a href="https://surma.dev/things/ditherpunk/">Ditherpunk — The article I wish I had about monochrome image dithering</a>.
It is an invaluable resource that combines lots of knowledge about dithering into one place. The main thing missing
from the post, however, is going beyond “monochrome”. Surma shows us how to dither with a 1-bit palette of black and
white, but what about more shades of gray? What about colour images? With this blog post I’d like to explore those
techniques, taking them out of my code and into English, so you can easily apply them elsewhere.</p>

<p><strong>First off, please read Surma’s post.</strong> It explains what dithering is, how it works, and many different algorithms.
I don’t feel the need to explain these again, but merely add on what I’ve learned.</p>

<h2 id="before-we-start">Before we start</h2>

<p>An HN commenter <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26122642">informed me</a> that you cannot accurately represent
linear RGB with just 8-bits (0-255), you need at least 12. Because of this, I have updated the blog post to use
16-bit color (0-65535), and will be updating the library shortly. Make sure you do this in your code too!</p>

<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>

<p>Dithering operations consist of at least two steps, applied to each pixel. Sometimes there are further steps, like
“modify these nearby pixels”, but these are the basic ones.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Modify the pixel’s colour value.</li>
  <li>Find the colour in the palette that is “closest” to that modified value and use that on the output image.</li>
</ol>

<p>Now, we know from Surma’s post that step 1 must be done with linear RGB values. Otherwise, different values will be
affected differently – for example adding 5 to each colour won’t affect all colours the same way.</p>

<p>But what about step 2? How do we find the closest colour in the palette? In 1-bit dithering we don’t have to worry
about this, because anything above 0.5 is white, and anything below is black. But when your palette colours can be
anyhere in a 3D space, it is something that needs to be figured out.</p>

<p>Perhaps surprisingly, we’re not looking for a way that matches human perception. In fact, we are using Euclidean
distance with linear RGB values, which doesn’t match human perception at all! Why is this?
Thomas Mansencal (<a href="https://github.com/KelSolaar">@KelSolaar</a>) explains it best:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You can factor out the observer [the human] because what you are interested in here is basically energy
conservation. The idea being that for a given pool of radiant power emitters, if you remove a certain number of
them, by how much must the radiant power of the remaining ones be increased to be the same as that of the full
pool. It is really a ratio and doing those operations in a linear space is totally appropriate!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This helped it click for me. Dithering can be thought of as trying to reconstruct the “radiant power” of the original
pixel colours, while restricted to a certain set of “emitters”, aka the palette colours. It is only with linearized
RGB values that we can properly measure the radiant power.</p>

<h2 id="random-noise-grayscale">Random Noise (grayscale)</h2>

<p>Random noise is a good one to start with, to show the differences between 1-bit dithering and larger palettes.</p>

<p>Surma does this by basically just adding a random number from -0.5 to 0.5, and then thresholding it.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>grayscaleImage</span><span>.</span><span>mapSelf</span><span>(</span><span>brightness</span> <span>=&gt;</span>
  <span>brightness</span> <span>+</span> <span>(</span><span>Math</span><span>.</span><span>random</span><span>()</span> <span>-</span> <span>0.5</span><span>)</span> <span>&gt;</span> <span>0.5</span> 
    <span>?</span> <span>1.0</span> 
    <span>:</span> <span>0.0</span>
<span>);</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>In my library, there are two separate random noise functions. One is for grayscale, and one is for RGB. The grayscale
one looks like this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>roundClamp</span><span>(</span><span>float32</span><span>(</span><span>gray</span><span>)</span> <span>+</span> <span>65535.0</span><span>*</span><span>(</span><span>rand</span><span>.</span><span>Float32</span><span>()</span><span>*</span><span>(</span><span>max</span><span>-</span><span>min</span><span>)</span><span>+</span><span>min</span><span>))</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The math with <code>min</code> and <code>max</code> is just to put the random value in the desired range. If we clean that up it’s more
understandable:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>roundClamp</span><span>(</span><span>float32</span><span>(</span><span>gray</span><span>)</span> <span>+</span> <span>65535.0</span><span>*</span><span>rand</span><span>())</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><code>rand()</code> just represents a function that does whatever range we want, -0.5 to 0.5 in this case.</p>

<p>So, obviously this is quite similar to what Surma does. The heavy lifing of the dithering in this case is done by the
other code, the part that finds the best palette colour.</p>

<p>The main thing that’s worth noting here is how the rounding works. <code>roundClamp</code> rounds the value to an integer, and then
clamps it to the range 0-65535. But how is the rounding done?</p>

<p>Another <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26122642">HN commenter</a> shared <a href="http://www.cplusplus.com/articles/1UCRko23/">this link</a>
which discusses different rounding methods, and the problems with the way rounding is often done. The best solution is to
use a rounding function that does this:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Given a number exactly halfway between two values, round to the even value (zero is considered even here).</p>

  <p>round( 1.7 ) –&gt; 2 round( 2.7 ) –&gt; 3<br>
round( 1.5 ) –&gt; 2 round( 2.5 ) –&gt; 2<br>
round( 1.3 ) –&gt; 1 round( 2.3 ) –&gt; 2</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is not really about dithering, but this is a pretty important point to get things right mathematically.
Make sure you do it! Otherwise your outputs will be biased.</p>

<h2 id="random-noise-rgb">Random Noise (RGB)</h2>

<p>Back to random noise, but for colour this time.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>r</span> <span>=</span> <span>roundClamp</span><span>(</span><span>float32</span><span>(</span><span>r</span><span>)</span> <span>+</span> <span>65535.0</span><span>*</span><span>(</span><span>rand</span><span>.</span><span>Float32</span><span>()</span><span>*</span><span>(</span><span>maxR</span><span>-</span><span>minR</span><span>)</span><span>+</span><span>minR</span><span>))</span>

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>And simplified:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>r</span> <span>=</span> <span>roundClamp</span><span>(</span><span>float32</span><span>(</span><span>r</span><span>)</span> <span>+</span> <span>65535.0</span><span>*</span><span>randR</span><span>())</span>
<span>g</span> <span>=</span> <span>roundClamp</span><span>(</span><span>float32</span><span>(</span><span>g</span><span>)</span> <span>+</span> <span>65535.0</span><span>*</span><span>randG</span><span>())</span>
<span>b</span> <span>=</span> <span>roundClamp</span><span>(</span><span>float32</span><span>(</span><span>b</span><span>)</span> <span>+</span> <span>65535.0</span><span>*</span><span>randB</span><span>())</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Pretty simple, it just adds randomness in each channel. This can be done with grayscale images too, but it won’t
work very well, because grayscale colours only actually have one dimension. So it will just not add as much
randomness as you would expect.</p>

<p>Also note that usually you’ll want the random ranges to be the same for R, G, and B.</p>

<p>Here’s an example:</p>

<h2 id="ordered-dithering">Ordered Dithering</h2>

<h3 id="modifying-threshold-matrices">Modifying threshold matrices</h3>

<p>Most of the resources online that talk about ordered dithering talk about a “threshold matrix”. “Thresholding” is
how these matrices are applied for 1-bit dithering. You divide the matrix by whatever number is specified, scale
it to the colour value range, and compare it to each pixel in the image. If it’s less than the matrix value, make
it black, otherwise white. Obviously this doesn’t work with any other kind of palette. So what’s the solution?</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordered_dithering">Wikipedia</a> offers an answer. Unfortunately there’s no citation,
but I’ve confirmed independently that it works. Here it is with some of my own math added as well.</p>

It’s the amount the matrix will be applied to the
image. The closer to zero it is, the smaller the range of input colors that will be dithered. Colors outside
that range will be quantized. Usually you’ll want a strength of <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mn>1.0</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">1.0</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>, to apply the matrix and dither fully, but
sometimes reducing it can be useful, to reduce noise in the output image. It is inversely proportional to contrast –
that is, when you reduce the <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>s</mi><mi>t</mi><mi>r</mi><mi>e</mi><mi>n</mi><mi>g</mi><mi>t</mi><mi>h</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">strength</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>, it is visually similar to increasing the contrast.</p>

<p><span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>s</mi><mi>t</mi><mi>r</mi><mi>e</mi><mi>n</mi><mi>g</mi><mi>t</mi><mi>h</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">strength</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> can also be negative, from <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mn>0</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">0</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> to <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mo>−</mo><mn>1.0</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">-1.0</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>. This is useful in certain cases where the matrix usually
makes things bright, like what Surma describes with Bayer matrices.</p>

<p>Note that <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mn>65535</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">65535</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> is multiplied by <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>s</mi><mi>t</mi><mi>r</mi><mi>e</mi><mi>n</mi><mi>g</mi><mi>t</mi><mi>h</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">strength</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> because the colours in my code are in the range <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mo stretchy="false">[</mo><mn>0</mn><mo separator="true">,</mo><mn>65535</mn><mo stretchy="false">]</mo></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">[0, 65535]</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>. If yours
are different you can change that number.</p>

<p><span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>m</mi><mi>a</mi><mi>x</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">max</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> is the value the entire matrix is divided by. It represents the maximum value of the matrix, and normalizes
it by dividing. Usually this is the product of the dimensions of the matrix. It can also be the
largest value in the matrix plus one.</p>

<p>The result of applying this operation to each cell of the matrix is a new, precalculated matrix, which can be added
to a pixel’s colour value for dithering. Adding 0.5 does not need to happen in this case. In my library, I call the
function that does this <code>convThresholdToAddition</code>, because that’s essentially the purpose of this – converting
a threshold matrix into one that can be used for addition.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> This is designed for matrices that range from <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mn>0</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">0</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> to <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>m</mi><mi>a</mi><mi>x</mi><mo>−</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">max - 1</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>. If you’re using a matrix you found that
starts at <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mn>1</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">1</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>, you’ll usually just want to subtract one from each value when you program it, then apply the operation
I described above.</p>

<h3 id="using-a-modified-matrix">Using a modified matrix</h3>

<p>Now that you’ve modified the matrix so it can be used for addition, it needs to be applied to the image. This is pretty
simple. Use modulus so the matrix values are tiled across the image, and add the same value in the R, G, and B channels.
If you’re using a grayscale image you can just apply it in the one channel, or still use RGB. Since the same value is
being added it doesn’t make much of a difference. Like always, make sure to clamp the values to the proper colour range.</p>

<p>Doing all of this definitely works with colour images, but it’s not the greatest. Here’s an example, where the palette
is red, green, and black.</p>

<p>As you can see, it doesn’t really emulate any of the yellow in the first example, while Floyd-Steinberg can. Once yellow is added
to the palette it looks pretty good though.</p>

	<div>
		
<p>A few days ago, <a href="https://www.emiratesmarsmission.ae/">Emirates Mars Mission (Hope)</a>, and <a href="https://destevez.net/tag/tianwen/">Tianwen-1</a> performed their Mars orbit injection burn (MOI). <a href="https://amsat-dl.org/">AMSAT-DL</a> made a livestream for each of the two events, showing the X-band signals of the spacecraft as received with the <a href="https://amsat-dl.org/en/20-meter-antenna/">20m antenna at Bochum</a>.</p>



<p>In the case of Tianwen-1 the signal was pretty strong even while the spacecraft was on the low gain antenna, and we could clearly see the <a href="https://youtu.be/1myQ5tIig0w?t=6593">change in Doppler rate as the thrusters fired up</a>. However, in the case of Emirates Mars Mission the signal <a href="https://youtu.be/413DdMua8ec?t=2641">disappeared as soon as the spacecraft switched to the low gain antenna</a>. In fact <a href="https://eyes.nasa.gov/dsn/dsn.html">DSN Now</a> reported a received power of -155 dBm with the 34m DSS55. That was a large drop from the -118 dBm that it was reporting with the high gain antenna. Therefore, nothing could be seen in the livestream waterfall until the spacecraft returned to the high gain antenna, well after the manoeuvre was finished.</p>



<p>Nevertheless, a weak trace of the carrier was still present in the livestream audio, and it could be seen by appropriate FFT processing, for example with <a href="https://github.com/miek/inspectrum">inspectrum</a>. I put up a <a href="https://twitter.com/ea4gpz/status/1359152918004461574">couple</a> of <a href="https://twitter.com/ea4gpz/status/1359161368289701888">tweets</a> showing this, but at the moment I wasn’t completely sure if what I was seeing was the spacecraft’s signal or some interference. After the livestream ended, I’ve been able to analyse the audio more carefully and realize that not only this weak signal was in fact the Hope probe, but that the start of the burn was recorded in perfect conditions.</p>



<p>In this post I’ll show how to process the livestream audio to clearly show the change in drift rate at the start of the burn and measure the acceleration of the spacecraft.</p>



<p>The idea with this post is that anyone can reproduce what I’m going to show. After all, the only data I’m using is the audio of a livestream that is recorded in Youtube. For convenience, I include with my code the segment of data I’m using, which is a 5 minute segment that starts 7850 seconds into the audio of the full video. If you want to start from scratch, you can use any webpage or application to download the audio of the full video, and work with that. In my case I used a webpage to download the audio in 320kbps MP3 format, then converted it to an 8ksps WAV file, and used <a href="https://www.scipy.org/">SciPy</a> to read the WAV file and extract the 5 minute segment.</p>



<p>In the figure below you can see the waterfall of the first minute of the 5 minute clip I cut. The spacecraft signal can be seen as faint diagonal lines between 700 and 800 Hz. They are quite weak and have some fading, but hopefully you can see them.</p>



<figure><a href="https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/emm_start.png"><img width="644" height="438" src="https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/emm_start-644x438.png" alt="" srcset="https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/emm_start-644x438.png 644w, https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/emm_start-300x204.png 300w, https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/emm_start.png 730w" sizes="(max-width: 644px) 100vw, 644px"></a></figure>



<p>There is something that is convenient to remark about the Doppler correction system that was used at Bochum for the livestreams. First, the system used the trajectory of the the spacecraft, ignoring the burn, to compute the expected Doppler. Therefore, the expected Doppler computation would be quite good before the burn started, but as soon as the thrusters fired it would diverge more and more from reality.</p>



<p>Second, rather than constantly adjusting the tuning to correct for Doppler and keep the signal exactly centred, the system performed discrete jumps of fixed size with the goal of keeping the signal inside a certain band, roughly 350 Hz wide. This had the effect of creating a sawtooth wave in the waterfall and the audio. As the signal arrived to one edge of this imaginary band, the Doppler correction performed a frequency jump to put the signal at the other edge of the band.</p>



<p>This can be seen quite clearly in the livestream of Tianwen-1. At the <a href="https://youtu.be/1myQ5tIig0w?t=0">beginning of the livestream</a>, the drift rate was quite low, since the spacecraft was well away from periapsis. Therefore, the period of the sawtooth was long. As the spacecraft approached periapsis and the drift rate increased, the period of the sawtooth <a href="https://youtu.be/1myQ5tIig0w?t=4667">kept reducing</a> until it was quite short <a href="https://youtu.be/1myQ5tIig0w?t=6023">right before the burn</a>. However, note that the amplitude of the sawtooth (this is, the width of this imaginary frequency band) is always the same.</p>



<p>The next figure shows the waterfall of the audio when the burn starts. It is a bit difficult to see, but hopefully you’ll be able to see two or three lines at the left around 800 Hz, and then a couple of lines going up in steps and with less slope, near the middle of the image.</p>



<figure><a href="https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/emm_burn.png"><img width="644" height="438" src="https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/emm_burn-644x438.png" alt="" srcset="https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/emm_burn-644x438.png 644w, https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/emm_burn-300x204.png 300w, https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/emm_burn.png 730w" sizes="(max-width: 644px) 100vw, 644px"></a></figure>



<p>When the burn starts, the drift rate increases (i.e., changes from negative to less negative), since the retrograde burn accelerated the spacecraft towards Earth. As the Doppler correction keeps tuning in steps to correct for a more negative drift rate, we get steps upwards. This is the same that happened at the <a href="http://youtu.be/1myQ5tIig0w?t=6593">start of the burn of Tianwen-1</a>. In that case the drift rate became almost zero, and then positive, since the thrust-to-mass ratio of Tianwen-1 is higher than that of Hope.</p>



<p>The resolution of the plots shown above, and those that come later is 0.98 Hz per FFT bin (FFT size of 8192 with a sample rate of 8ksps) and 64ms per time step (due to the use of overlapping FFT, and an advance of 512 samples per FFT).</p>



<p>In what follows, the idea is to undo the Doppler correction done at Bochum to join back the pieces of the sawtooth wave and also correct for the drift rate in order to get a signal of constant frequency that we may see clearly in a spectrum plot. To do this, we just need to create a sawtooth that has the same (or almost the same) phase, amplitude and period as the one that the Doppler correction created, and then use that sawtooth to control the frequency of a local oscillator with which we mix the audio signal. I have adjusted the parameters of the sawtooth by hand until I obtained something where the resulting signal before the start of the burn had a constant frequency and had no (or very brief) jumps.</p>



<p>The result of this correction can be seen below. We see the signal before the burn as a flat line at constant frequency, slightly above 800 Hz, and then the signal rising up as the burn starts. The vertical white line marks the moment in which the start of the burn happens, which is at 184.96 seconds into this 5 minute segment. The right panel contains the spectrum plot of the data in the left of the waterfall (to the left of the white line). The signal can be seen very clearly, with an (S+N)/N of about 5dB, which would give an estimated CN0 on the order of 3 dBHz.</p>

<p>If we now change the drift rate correction, we can make flat the signal after the burn. We see that the drift rate is not constant, but rather it increases slightly with time, so it is not possible to find a drift rate that makes the line totally flat. I have chosen a drift rate that makes the line flat at approximately 20 seconds after the start of the burn. The  right panel shows the spectrum of the right part of the waterfall (after the white line). Again, we have some 5 dB of (S+N)/N.</p>



<figure><a href="https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/emm_after_burn.png"><img width="644" height="427" src="https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/emm_after_burn-644x427.png" alt="" srcset="https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/emm_after_burn-644x427.png 644w, https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/emm_after_burn-300x199.png 300w, https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/emm_after_burn-768x510.png 768w, https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/emm_after_burn.png 856w" sizes="(max-width: 644px) 100vw, 644px"></a></figure>



<p>We have seen how by correcting the drift rate the “corner” of the Doppler curve, which marks the exact moment in which the thrusters started firing, can seen in the waterfall, whereas with the waterfall of the original audio signal it was impossible to see this corner. The moment in which the corner happens corresponds to 2:13:54.96 into the video, which by looking at the timestamps that appear in the screen shown in the video we can associate with 15:41:38 UTC (with a precision of perhaps one or two seconds). Since the light-time delay for this burn was 637 seconds, this means that the burn started at 15:31:01 UTC. This matches the official report of a start at 15:30 UTC, because it is possible that ullage motors fired one minute before the main burn, as we saw in <a href="https://destevez.net/2020/08/tianwen-1-tcm-1/">Tianwen-1’s TCM-1</a>.</p>



<p>The drift rate before the burn is -19.5 Hz/s, and when the burn starts it changes to -8 Hz/s. Such a drift rate change gives a line-of-sight acceleration of -0.41 m/s². This is just the projection of the acceleration vector onto the line-of-sight. In order to compute the full acceleration, we assume that it happened along the velocity vector of the spacecraft (with respect to Mars), and compute the projection of the unit velocity vector and the unit line-of-sight vector to Earth at the start of the burn. This computation ignores light-time delays, but is good enough for our purposes, since the line-of-sight vector changes slowly enough. The projection is 0.86.</p>



<p>This means that we only see 86% of the total acceleration in the Doppler drift rate. Therefore, the total acceleration must have been around -0.48 m/s². This contrasts to the theoretical acceleration of -0.58 m/s² that 720 N of thrust (since the spacecraft has 6x 120 N thrusters) applied to 1250 kg of mass produce (here the mass comes from a dry mass of 550 kg and 700 kg of fuel, assuming that the probe already spent in mid-course corrections 100 kg of its initial 800 kg).</p>



<p>Working backwards, we see that the measured acceleration of -0.48 m/s² would correspond to a thrust of 594 N. In fact, while I <a href="https://twitter.com/ea4gpz/status/1359081278079987712">worked out the planning of the manoeuvre on Twitter</a>, I noticed that the publicly stated burn length of 27 minutes was way too long to achieve the target orbit with a thrust of 720 N. To have a burn of 27 minutes that gave me the required apoapsis altitude I had to use a thrust of 658 N.</p>



<p>Note that all these calculations about the acceleration are just estimates, since we don’t know exactly the mass of the spacecraft, and our estimate of 1250 kg could be wrong by up to 10%. In any case, I think it is always good to go through these calculations to show what can be achieved with simple Doppler measurements and to check that the signal we observed matches what we expected.</p>



<p>The calculations and plots in this post have been done in <a href="https://github.com/daniestevez/jupyter_notebooks/blob/master/EMM/MOI/Bochum%20MOI%20recording.ipynb">this Jupyter notebook</a>. The data file with the 5 minute segment of the livestream audio is included in the same repository. The results that I have shown are intended to be easily reproducible. It is possible to run the notebook with the supplied data or to start from scratch by downloading the audio from the livestream video on Youtube.</p>

<p>How things have (and have not changed). I'm still a command-line junkie with at least two xterm windows open. I'm still using a 3x3 virtual desktop. However, instead of fvwm, it is now LXDE. I've also switched from FreeBSD to Linux and I'm running Lubuntu as my distribution.</p>

<p>There are a lot of indispensable GUI tools that I use. These include Firefox, lyx, Gimp, KeepassX, Shutter, viking, dia, Wireshark, calibre, audacity, Handbrake and VLC. But where possible I still prefer to script things. My main development languages are still shell, Perl and C.</p>

<p>My shell is now bash. The vi keystrokes are burned into my fingertips and, as long as vim can be ported to new systems, that will be my text editor until I pass on. My mail client is now mutt (definitely not a web client) and my mail is stored locally, not on someone else's server.</p>

<p>The only issue I have is that, since a job change, I now have to deal with Windoze things. Thus, I have VirtualBox, libreoffice and Wine to help me do that.</p>

<p>I started with Unix on a Pyramid 90x. I now have a smart phone that blows the 90x out of the water on performance, RAM and storage. But I'm so very happy that, somewhere down underneath, there is still a Bourne shell and an operating system that does open(), close(), read(), write(), fork() and exec()!</p>

<p>Nearly every solar power panel sold in the European Union has its origins in China’s <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2020/07/24/china-uighurs-europe-sanctions-381080" target="_blank">oppressed Xinjiang region</a>.</p>



<p>The solar industry and Brussels lawmakers argue Europe’s renewable energy push should not come at a human cost amid long-standing international concern over reports China has <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-rights-un-idUSKBN1KV1SU" target="_blank">detained 1 million people</a> with Muslim backgrounds in camps in Xinjiang and is putting them to work.</p>



<p>“Everybody knows what’s going on in China, and when facilities are based there you have to accept that there’s a high possibility that forced labor will be used,” said Milan Nitzschke, president of <a href="https://www.prosun.org/en/mission-en/" target="_blank">EU ProSun</a>, an alliance of solar businesses seeking to promote sustainable, solar manufacturing based in the EU.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While the U.S. has already rolled out sanctions against products such as cotton and tomatoes originating from Xinjiang, the European Commission has avoided confronting China with any trade measures. </p>



<p>It has fallen to lawmakers in the European Parliament to try to push Brussels to implement trade bans, on all industries including solar panels, if companies are implicated in human rights abuses.</p>



<p>“Import bans need to complement as a last resort if forced labor is involved in the production, like in Xinjiang," said Green MEP Anna Cavazzini.</p>



<h3>Suspicions about every panel</h3>



<p>For the past decade Beijing has been carrying out a campaign to <a href="https://www.politico.eu/?p=1256994">detain and “reeducate”</a> the Muslim-majority population of the Xinjiang region.</p>



<p>Human rights groups have alerted that state-run reeducation centers <a href="https://www.politico.eu/?p=1408155">double as forced labor camps</a>, with detained people obliged to work in low-skilled, labor-intensive sectors such as cotton picking. But recent reports out of the region suggest the Xinjiang government has also been focusing on “upskilling” the workforce and putting them to work in more specialized sectors.</p>



<p>That’s of particular concern to the global solar industry given Xinjiang’s outsized role in the production of <a href="https://www.politico.eu/?p=62601">polysilicon</a>, a material used to make photovoltaic (PV) cells.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Nearly every silicon-based solar module — at least 95 percent of the market — is likely to have some Xinjiang silicon in,” said Jenny Chase, head of solar analysis at BloombergNEF.</p>



<p>Industry analyst Johannes Bernreuter added that last year roughly 45 percent of the global supply of solar-grade polysilicon came from the region.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Raw polysilicon is transported to factories — usually outside Xinjiang — and melted into cylinders, known as ingots. Because it’s blended with polysilicon produced in other regions, it’s difficult to trace material that could potentially come from forced labor camps in Xinjiang, Chase and Bernreuter said.</p>



<p>For any single solar panel “the mathematical probability is relatively high" it has some material produced in the province, said Bernreuter.</p>



<h3>An open secret</h3>



<p>Beijing <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/china-cotton-forced-labour-trfn-idUSKBN28P2CM" target="_blank">insists</a> the camps — which it calls “vocational training facilities” — are simply “helping people of all ethnic groups secure stable employment” and argues that this is “entirely different from forced labor.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The China Photovoltaic Industry Association <a href="http://www.chinapv.org.cn/association_news/922.html" target="_blank">said</a> accusations of forced labor in Xinjiang were ”the lie of the century fabricated by several institutions and people from Western countries.”</p>



<p>In Europe, industry players said the potential use of forced labor to produce material included in solar panels imported into the EU was an open secret.</p>



<p>Industry group SolarPower Europe said it was investigating the situation in Xinjiang with its membership and looking at different options to ensure no forced labor was used in the PV manufacturing process.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“We cannot accept that such practices take place in the solar PV sector, which is a leader in sustainability and a key enabler of the energy transition,” said SolarPower Europe CEO Walburga Hemetsberger.</p>



<p>The group said its members were using supply chain management guidelines, certifications and standards to ensure that forced labor was not used, and that it was evaluating how to encourage best practices across the industry.</p>



<h3>Distancing measures</h3>



<p>If the EU’s solar sector wants to distance itself from solar components manufactured under questionable circumstances in Xinjiang, it would have several ways of doing so.</p>



<p>Bloomberg NEF’s Chase said one option would be to continue accepting components made with polysilicon from China, but insisting that material produced in Xinjiang be exempted from the mix blended in factories.</p>



<p>“There’s plenty of non-Xinjiang polysilicon,” Chase said — around a quarter of the global market in 2021 is expected to come from the U.S. and the EU. But she said enforcing the exclusion would be complicated and likely make little difference for the plight of any workers. </p>



<p>Xinjiang polysilicon would simply shift to the domestic market and customers in the EU and the U.S. “will pay an almost unnoticeable amount more for modules,” said Chase. “Honestly, it is unlikely to be a big deal for solar, but good news for companies that make silicon outside Xinjiang.”</p>



<p>Perhaps unsurprisingly, European manufacturers believe the answer is repatriating the industry back to the EU and using tariffs if necessary.</p>



<p>“Solar components can be produced in Europe,” EU ProSun’s Nitzschke said. “The companies making them were here until 2012 but they went bankrupt when the tariffs used to address Chinese overproduction and public financing were removed, allowing their companies to undercut us in terms of price.”</p>



<p>Nitzschke argued the EU should revise its trade deals and ensure that the same standards on human rights and forced labor that apply in Europe be extended to imported products. “We can’t have a level playing field if there’s ethical leakage, and you could prevent it by applying tariffs to products that don’t meet our standards.”</p>



<p>SolarPower Europe’s Hemetsberger said she didn’t favor trade tariffs due to their often counterproductive effect on European solar growth. "The best way of ensuring that imported goods abide by strict human rights protocols and ethical standards is improving the level of transparency of the global value chain so that EU-based suppliers can make informed decisions."</p>



<p>The European Commission has said the EU’s solar capacity needs to <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/clima/policies/strategies/2030_en#:~:text=2030%20climate%20and%20energy%20framework%20%2D%20existing%20ambition,32.5%25%20improvement%20in%20energy%20efficiency" target="_blank">grow five-fold by 2030</a> to meet its climate targets. Hemetsberger said there was a “solar manufacturing renaissance” underway in Europe.</p>



<p>“Nearly all areas of the supply chain can be produced in Europe,” said Gunter Erfurt, CEO of <a href="https://www.meyerburger.com/en/company/about-meyer-burger/management/" target="_blank">Meyer Burger</a>, a Swiss-German solar module production company that aims to reestablish solar’s industrial supply chain on the Continent, pointing out that solar-grade polysilicon is <a href="https://www.wacker.com/cms/en-us/about-wacker/wacker-at-a-glance/profile-and-organization/wacker-polysilicon.html" target="_blank">already produced</a> at several sites in Germany.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I have a lot of respect for the Chinese strategy because 10 years ago they understood what Europe is still struggling to grasp: that solar is the future,” he said. “EU leaders speak of batteries, electric mobility, hydrogen … But where is the electricity to produce those things supposed to come from? We are already the technological frontrunners, what we need now is financing to bring production back.”&nbsp;</p>



<h3>Growing pressure on Brussels</h3>



<p>Solar panels are yet another example of goods made with forced labor entering the EU market, raising <a href="https://www.politico.eu/?p=1572638">criticisms from lawmakers and NGOs</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Joerg Wuttke, president of the EU Chamber of Commerce in China, expects the EU to step up scrutiny of imports from Xinjiang, including solar power panels.</p>



<p>“The pressure is piling on the Commission and member states that they have to use unilateral means to send China a message, such as screening of imported products,” said Wuttke.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Brussels <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/eu-china-inestment-agreement-soft-approach-odds-us/">is taking its time</a> when its comes to tackling goods made with forced labor.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Commission is working on <a href="https://www.politico.eu/?p=1496802">a new tool</a> — due diligence legislation — which would make EU companies accountable if their suppliers breach labor and climate laws. But MEPs would like the Commission to go even further to tackle serious situations such as the one in Xinjiang. Last month, the European Parliament’s legal affairs committee <a href="https://www.politico.eu/?p=1590418">called on</a> the Commission to introduce an import ban for “products related to severe human rights violations.”</p>



<p>“The EU due diligence legislation has a key role to play in that as it will help ensure that human rights are respected throughout our supply chains,” said MEP Cavazzini. She backs an import ban if suppliers are shown to be involved in human rights abuses.</p>



<p>The Commission is <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/better-regulation/have-your-say/initiatives/12548-Sustainable-corporate-governance" target="_blank">set to</a> come up with its supply chain responsibility proposal by June after a public consultation ended this week.</p>



<p>According to Justice Commissioner Didier Reynders, who is in charge of the file, new rules are likely to focus on so-called Tier 1 suppliers and to make reference to the International Labor Organization’s core conventions, which China committed to ratify under the new investment deal concluded with the EU.</p>



<p>“Expanding the use of renewables is of utmost importance in order to stop the climate crisis. But it cannot come at the cost of human rights,” said Cavazzini.</p>

MRR helps you track the month-to-month revenue easily because it’s predictable.</p><p>Now, let’s look at a more informative list so you can better compare the pros and cons:</p><h3 id="what-are-the-costs-of-mrr">What are the costs of MRR?</h3><ul><li>Churning</li><li>Increased demand for customer retention</li><li>Potential delay in ROI</li></ul><h3 id="what-are-the-benefits-of-mrr">What are the benefits of MRR?</h3><ul><li>Creates a predictable monthly revenue stream</li><li>Enables community involvement and promotes a loyal fanbase</li><li>Shows the strengths and weaknesses of sales</li><li>Helps create reliable business decisions based on results</li></ul><p>For example, you can’t download the entire Netflix catalog and access the services offline because your not purchasing and licensing the software directly. MRR is a vital metric for Netflix to track because they are required to maintain the software.</p><p>Dan Tyre, the sales director at HubSpot says:</p><blockquote>MRR is the most important metric for financial growth. There are other important metrics like growth rate, retention, average sales price, and rep productivity, but at the end of the day, the most important metric is the amount of monthly recurring revenue customers are willing to put on their credit card or pay through an invoice</blockquote><p><strong>Mamoon Hamid, Social Capital:</strong></p><blockquote>Every SaaS company should live and die by MRR, because that’s something that you can’t go without.
<cite></cite></blockquote><h2 id="2-churn">2. Churn</h2><p>When making butter, churning is part of the process. The same applies to SaaS companies. Let me explain.</p><div itemscope="" itemprop="mainEntity" itemtype="https://schema.org/Question"><h3 itemprop="name">What is Churn?</h3><p itemprop="text">Simply put, churn is the loss of subscribers. Let’s face it. You are going to lose some customers. Accounting for that loss allows you to see what is going wrong and how you can improve your customers’ retention.</p></div><p>This is the reason the churn metric is important for SaaS companies.</p><p>Two types of Churn are vital to SaaS companies. Customer Churn and Revenue Churn. While both are important and connected, they play different roles in business decisions.</p><h3 id="customer-churn">Customer Churn</h3><p>Customer churn is the loss of customers. If you are using a yearly subscription model, it is best to note these losses every month or quarter. Finding out why these subscribers canceled their subscriptions gives valuable information to improve customer retention.</p><p>Are customers canceling their subscriptions because it isn’t of any use to them? Did they have a problem with customer service? Taking account of the different personalities, needs, and wants of lost subscribers saves you from inevitable catastrophes in the future.</p><p>HubSpot wrote an insightful article titled: <a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/service/how-to-reduce-customer-churn" target="_blank">Customer Churn: 7 Tips to Stop the Attrition</a>.</p><p>Here are some of the key takeaways and an outline of the reasons customers churn:</p><div><ul><li><strong>Pricing</strong>: is it genuinely worth the cost?</li><li><strong>Product/Market fit</strong>: does the product truly fit the market?</li><li><strong>User experience</strong>: is your product buggy, glitchy, or crashing?</li><li><strong>Customer experience</strong>: did your customer have a bad experience?</li><li><strong>Underappreciated Brand Values</strong>: do your values not align with the market?</li><li><strong>Competitor Intervention</strong>: are you keeping up with your competitors?</li><li><strong>Plateaued Growth</strong>: are you moving towards profit over customer growth?</li></ul></div><p>Brian Balfour Founder/CEO of Reforge Former VP Growth at HubSpot:</p><blockquote>If your retention is poor then nothing else matters</blockquote><p>To calculate customer churn, simply take the number of people that canceled their subscription for the month, quarter, or year.</p><p>HubSpot writer Sofia Bernazzani recommends monthly or quarterly calculations and a more in-depth look at the <a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/service/saas-metrics" target="_blank">customer count</a>.</p><p>You can get the churn rate by taking the total number of churned customers and dividing them by the total number of customers from last month, quarter, or year.</p><p><strong>Churn Rate = Total # Churned Customers / Total # Customers of Previous Month</strong></p><p><img src="https://pixllabs.io/blog/images/saas-metrics/churn-rate.jpg" alt="Churn Rate Formula"></p><h3 id="revenue-churn">Revenue Churn</h3><p>Revenue churn is just as important as customer churn. While it is important to track customers that are leaving, which subscription they were also using matters.</p><p>If there is a variable option for subscriptions, tracking revenue churn can show which plan or subscription is churning the most.</p><p>For example, a business has a $100 option and a $200 option for their subscription plan. If more people are canceling the $100 subscription vs. the $200 subscription, you can change something to retain more users or try upselling them with the $200 subscription.</p><p>Revenue churn can potentially point you in the direction of a problem. Either the prices or the features need readjusting.</p><h2 id="3-arpa-average-revenue-per-account">3. ARPA (Average Revenue per Account)</h2><p>It is crucial to know which products customers enjoy and produce revenue and which products they avoid. You can track growth and revenue on a unit-by-unit basis through an understanding of the ARPA metric.</p><p>ARPA is the Average Revenue per Account. This metric for SaaS companies can also be the Average Revenue per User or Unit. Tracking your ARPA is beneficial for investors to find products that generate strong revenue.</p><h3 id="how-do-you-track-arpa">How do you Track ARPA?</h3><p>You can track your ARPA by taking your MRR (listed above) and dividing that by the number of customers you have. Tracking your ARPA can be done on your billing cycle, be that annually, quarterly, or monthly.</p><div><p>MRR / # of Customers = APRA</p></div><h3 id="new-vs-existing-accounts">New vs. Existing Accounts</h3><p>While tracking ARPA, new and existing accounts will be mixed. It is beneficial to separate these two into Average Revenue per New Account and Average Revenue per Existing Account. This allows you to compare the behavior of new customers currently learning the product vs. existing customers that already have a grasp of the product.</p><p>The way to calculate both of these remains the same. The only difference is that you divide the work for more data.</p><h2 id="4-ltv-customer-lifetime-value">4. LTV (Customer Lifetime Value)</h2><p>What is the potential value of a customer? It depends on how long they stay subscribed. Finding out the Customer Lifetime Value, or LTV, gives you the average financial value of a specific customer or an average customer.</p><h3 id="how-to-calculate-ltv">How to Calculate LTV</h3><p>To calculate your LTV, you will need three metrics. These are the following:</p><ul><li>churn rate</li><li>customer lifetime rate</li><li>ARPA</li></ul><p>First, find the customer lifetime rate. This can be found by taking the number 1 and multiplying it by your churn rate. For example, if you have 20 customers and lose 1, your churn rate is 5%, and your customer lifetime rate would be 20 (1 / .05 = 20)</p><p>Second, find your average revenue per account (ARPA). This can be done by taking your total revenue, or MRR, and dividing the total number of customers you have. For example, if your revenue is $50,000, divide it by 20 customers. The ARPA is then $2,500 (50,000 / 20 = 2,500).</p><p>Last, your LTV will be your ARPA multiplied by your customer lifetime rate. In this example, our LTV is $50,000 (2,500 x 20).</p><div><p>ARPA multiplied by your customer lifetime rate</p></div><p><strong>An LTV gives you information on the worth of an average customer</strong>. You must account for this SaaS growth metric because you want to know how much an average customer gives you over the lifetime of their involvement. It allows you to make financial, marketing, and customer service decisions. Also, it can impress investors with the value of your company.</p><p>A useful practice is to increase ARPA (customers paying more) and to retain more customers (reduce churn).</p><p><strong>Here are some questions you should ask yourself after evaluating the LTV metric</strong>:</p><ul><li>Which customers should you spend your marketing resources on?</li><li>Who are your best customers?</li><li>How much time and resources should you spend on acquiring a new customer?</li><li>Who do you tailor your service to?</li></ul><h2 id="5-cac-customer-acquisition-cost">5. CAC (Customer Acquisition Cost)</h2><p>You have to spend money to make money. Hearing this can cause heads to turn. CAC, or Customer Acquisition Cost, tracks the amount you spend on average to acquire a customer.</p><p>You pay for ads, you have a sales department with salaries, you sponsor an event. These are all costs to gather new customers. Without customers, there is no business. The cost of acquiring these customers makes up your CAC.</p><div itemscope="" itemprop="mainEntity" itemtype="https://schema.org/Question"><h3 itemprop="name">How do you determine your CAC?</h3><p itemprop="text">When determining your CAC, you first want to total all the expenses to gather customers. Once you have that, divide it by the total number of customers you have. This is similar to finding out your MRR, except with expenses instead of revenue.</p></div><div><p>Total Sales and Marketing Expenses / Total # of Customers</p></div><h3 id="ltv-vs-cac">LTV vs. CAC</h3><p>There is no point in having a CAC without knowing the LTV. This is because balancing the CAC and LTV is crucial for any business. While the LTV shows you the value of a customer, the CAC shows you the cost of one.</p><p>For any business, you want the value of the customer to be higher than the cost to acquire one. How much higher is determined on a case-by-case business. See-a-see what I’m saying?</p><p>Essentially, the LTV is what you make, and the CAC is what it takes. Because of this, you want to get your CAC as low as possible. It is not so much about the exact numbers, but the …</p></div></div></div></section></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
        <p><em>Also in this series: <a href="https://commoncog.com/blog/chinese-businessmen-let-reality-be-the-teacher/">Let Reality Be The Teacher</a>, <a href="https://commoncog.com/blog/chinese-businessmen-superstition-doesnt-count/">Superstition Doesn't Count</a>, <a href="https://commoncog.com/blog/chinese-businessmen-maybe-strategy-matters/">Maybe Strategy Matters</a>, <a href="https://commoncog.com/blog/chinese-businessmen-cash-flow-is-king/">Cash Flow Is King</a>.</em></p><p>I met my friend Samuel in the first year of secondary school, way back when we were beginner teenagers. Samuel’s dad was a traditional Chinese businessman. He ran a pharmaceutical import business, supplying a handful of pharmacists around Kuching, population 300,000, the small city on Borneo that we both grew up in.</p><p>Over the years, Samuel’s father expanded the business into other interests: small real estate holdings, food &amp; beverage outlets, retail shops selling mobile phone kits, clothes, phone data plans and packages. If a business unit wasn’t doing too well, he was quick to shut things down. I observed most of this through my friend’s eyes; Samuel was being groomed to take over the company. Every year when I returned to Kuching, I discovered that Samuel’s father’s business empire had grown, inch by hard-won inch.</p><p>In Malaysia, where I was born, and in Singapore, where I did university, there is this trope of Chinese business acumen that we grew up with. Group identities are built around tropes, because tropes are the stories that we tell ourselves. This particular trope is a cultural one, born from the history of overseas Chinese.</p><p>The idea of a savvy business leader emerging from a humble background, thriving despite adversity, is one of the strongest touchstones in the stories that make up who we are. It is in the family histories of all those Chinese who migrated out of China; it is the story of our grandfathers, uncles, and (occasionally) aunties, making a living on distant shores; if we have no direct relationship to a relative in business, it is the stories that we are familiar with through our friends and <em>their</em> families.</p><p>This idea of a ‘Chinese businessman identity’ is what makes up a race-based superiority complex, as Amy Chua argues in <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Triple_Package">The Triple Package</a></em> — it is the reason certain racial identities help with certain types of achievement. When a Chinese person feels down-and-out in the education system, he has a path that allows him immediate respect in his society: that of doing business. The ones who succeed are lauded by their families and friends. The ones who don’t do so well are still seen as engaging in a respectable pursuit.</p><p>Over time, my friends and I referred to those Chinese peers who did well in business as having ‘Chinese businessman wisdom’. We used this phrase in the following way: “He’s not really into startups. He’s into business. He has Chinese businessman wisdom.” and “If even half of the people doing startups today have Chinese businessman wisdom, we would have a lot more successes on our hands.”</p><p>In other societies, and in other cultures, this might be phrased in a different way: “he’s business savvy”, or “he’s built for business”. But this phrase resonates with us because we are surrounded by positive examples of successful (and not so successful) Chinese businessmen, many of them seem to be built of the same mould. Nearly <em>all</em> the major tycoons in South East Asia are Chinese: Robert Kuok of Malaysia, Ng Teng Fong from Singapore, Mochtar Riady of Indonesia; the list goes on. They are described as thrifty, low-key, savvy, cunning, pragmatic, and respected — even begrudgingly! — by the communities they run businesses in.</p><p>Which then begs the question: “what exactly <em>is</em> Chinese businessman wisdom?” And how do you gain more of it?</p><h2 id="-business-sense-">‘Business Sense’</h2><figure><img src="https://commoncog.com/blog/content/images/2018/09/annie-spratt-224881-unsplash--1-.jpg" alt=""><figcaption>Traditional Chinese Shophouse frontage.</figcaption></figure><p>One aspect of the Chinese businessman wisdom trope is the idea that some people are born with business sense, and others are not.</p><p>Samuel’s dad is fond of saying that his brothers tried their hand at business before he did, and nearly all of them failed. He was the only one from his family who succeeded.</p><p>My maternal grandfather, who ran a car workshop on the island of Labuan for most of his adult life, was dinged for not being business savvy enough. The stories I heard of him are mostly about how he was kinder than he needed to be, and charged less than he could have charged. He <em>did</em> eventually sell off the business to retire in Kuching, and I’m now experiencing the terror of doing a business on my own, so I respect him tremendously; I think he’s done alright for himself. But the perception of ‘business savvy’ or ‘not business savvy’ as an inborn trait, unchangeable by circumstance, is hardcoded into our culture; an inalienable part of the ‘traditional Chinese businessman’.</p><p>I reject this notion almost as strongly as I reject the notion of pre-ordained destiny.</p><p>(This shouldn’t be a surprise to you — this entire blog is built around the idea of a keeping only the ideas that are <em>useful</em> to your future career. Believing in ‘business sense’ as an unchangeable, in-born trait is not actionable in a way that another belief might be; therefore reject it in favour for the actionable belief.)</p><p>A more acceptable version of this ‘business sense as an inborn trait’ meme is the one articulated by Robert Kuok in his memoirs:</p><blockquote>To me, talent and instincts in business are inborn and cannot be learned in the classroom. The best comparison I can give you is the game of soccer. The best soccer players are born with great innate talent. Even if a person is not born with the ability to be a top soccer player, he can learn to be a good soccer player through good coaching. But he will never be one of the great stars of the game, such as a Pele or a Messi, who are gifted people with inborn skills augmented by good coaching.</blockquote><p>This rings true to me, as it gels with my experience for writing and for Judo — the two other skills I am most familiar with. In <em>On Writing</em>, Stephen King makes a similar case:</p><blockquote>There are no bad dogs, according to the title of a popular training manual, but don’t tell that to the parent of a child mauled by a pit bull or a rottweiler; he or she is apt to bust your beak for you. And no matter how much I want to encourage the man or woman trying for the first time to write seriously, I can’t lie and say there are no bad writers. Sorry, but there are lots of bad writers. Some are on-staff at your local newspaper, usually reviewing little-theater productions or pontificating about the local sports teams. Some have scribbled their way to homes in the Caribbean, leaving a trail of pulsing adverbs, wooden characters, and vile passive-voice constructions behind them. Others hold forth at open-mike poetry slams, wearing black turtlenecks and wrinkled khaki pants; they spout doggerel about “my angry lesbian breasts” and “the tilted alley where I cried my mother’s name.”<p>Writers form themselves into the pyramid we see in all areas of human talent and human creativity. At the bottom are the bad ones. Above them is a group which is slightly smaller but still large and welcoming; these “are the competent writers. They may also be found on the staff of your local newspaper, on the racks at your local bookstore, and at poetry readings on Open Mike Night. These are folks who somehow understand that although a lesbian may be angry, her breasts will remain breasts.</p><p>The next level is much smaller. These are the really good writers. Above them—above almost all of us—are the Shakespeares, the Faulkners, the Yeatses, Shaws, and Eudora Weltys. They are geniuses, divine accidents, gifted in a way which is beyond our ability to understand, let alone attain. Shit, most geniuses aren’t able to understand themselves, and many of them lead miserable lives, realizing (at least on some level) that they are nothing but fortunate freaks, the intellectual version of runway models who just happen to be born with the right cheekbones and with breasts which fit the image of an age.</p></blockquote><p>I’ve long made peace with the idea that I might never become a Steinbeck or a Hemingway, but that with a lot of effort and a bit of luck, I am satisfied with the idea that I might become good. It’s only fair that the same could be said about business.</p><h2 id="rationality-and-business">Rationality and Business</h2><p>I’ve long suspected that much of business ability may be explained by rationality. This stems from experience: I ran the Vietnam office of a Singaporean company for three years, and I got to see a number of ‘traditional Chinese businessmen’ up close. In some of these cases, they were our clients; in others, we were competitors with opportunistic traditional Chinese businessmen, and received our licks in a race for customers.</p><p>(We also drove a few of them to bankruptcy, but that’s another story for another day).</p><p>The best businessmen we dealt with were always relentlessly pragmatic. They were rational in their actions — or at least, they were rational in the sense that they did what was necessary for the survival of their businesses. I remember a client who managed to get a <em>ton</em> of free add-ons out of us, which he did so skilfully none of us realised what was going on for months on end. (He’s over 50 years old and very very good; my old company remains in business with him). I also remember our discovery that a major competitor in our space had been gutted by its management, and turned into a real-estate investment company in Singapore.</p><p>But rationality alone didn’t explain everything that I saw. The question that most interested me was the following paradox: first, that the most successful Chinese businessmen were often the least educated ones. Second, that Chinese businessmen as a group were more superstitious than most, but that this didn’t seem to have much of an effect on their ability to run their businesses! And finally, that the vast majority of Chinese businesspeople did not think too far ahead. They optimised locally, and by keeping close tabs on the bottom line, shut down lines of business that weren’t performing as well.</p><p>The paradox was driven by my misguided attempt to figure out what made the successful ones successful, and to see if I could copy them. If intelligence were a deciding factor, then the educated Chinese businessmen were more likely to do better. If rationality were truly a …</p></section></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><p>Daniel Vassallo has rapidly become a highly respected figure in the bootstrapper/Indie Hacker community. One of
his (many) impressive feats to date was growing his Twitter following from zero to ~24k in around
nine months. This despite the fact that he was an ex-Amazon software engineer with no marketing experience.
More important than the actual follower numbers are his engagement levels, which
have led to him making six figures on various products.</p><p>Daniel created a video course explaining how he grew his Twitter audience called <a href="https://gumroad.com/l/twitter-audience">"Everyone
Can Build a Twitter Audience"</a>. I wanted to recap &amp; summarize
the key points as building an engaged audience is highly beneficial
for online course creators. Takeaways and thoughts are my own, and the links below are <strong>not</strong> affiliate/referral links.</p><h2><a href="#undefined"></a>Preamble - Why Care About Twitter</h2><p>Love it or hate it, Twitter can be incredibly effective for marketing products. Whilst other platforms
such as LinkedIn or Instagram can also be highly effective, this post is focused purely on Twitter. Twitter can be
particularly effective for marketing info products such as courses, ebooks, communities, podcasts, and newsletters. Over the last
years, I’ve seen a huge increase in business-related people sharing their stories and lessons
through Twitter.
Accounts like <a href="https://twitter.com/levelsio">@levelsio</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/ajlkn?lang=en">@ajlkn</a>,
and <a href="https://twitter.com/patio11">@patio11</a> have gained thousands of Twitter followers while they
shared the performance of their startups/SaaS/projects.</p><p>Daniel says: </p><blockquote><p>My Twitter account might be the most valuable asset I own.</p></blockquote><p><img src="https://coursemaker.org/assets/twitter_audience/course_gumroad_page.png" alt="course image"></p><h2><a href="#undefined"></a>1. Start By Defining Success</h2><p>One of the things I really liked about the course was the deliberate definition of "success" in
terms of a Twitter audience. What Daniel boils it down to is:</p><blockquote><p>An audience who want to hear what you have to say</p></blockquote><p>Daniel suggests focusing more on tweet engagement than follower numbers. He advocates
placing more emphasis on:</p><ul><li>Likes</li><li>Engagement rate to follower count ratio</li></ul><p>He gives Tim O'Reilly's account as an example of a disengaged audience:</p><p>Despite having ~1.7M followers:
<img src="https://coursemaker.org/assets/twitter_audience/tim_oreilly.png" alt="twitter funnel"></p><p>A typical Tim O'Reilly tweet might only get a few dozen likes (which is very low considering
the follower count):</p><p><img src="https://coursemaker.org/assets/twitter_audience/tim_oreilly_tweet.png" alt="twitter funnel"></p><p>In short, pay more attention to engagement than followers.</p><h2><a href="#undefined"></a>2. Establish + Ratchet Your Credibility</h2><p>Credibility is the foundational theme of the course. Credibility prompts the following reaction:</p><blockquote><p>You want to hear more from this person, you have more questions for them and think they are likely to have the answers</p></blockquote><p>Daniel argues that you don't necessarily have to be an expert in a topic to build credibility (although that

in the game".

on one niche, you can gradually "ratchet" your credibility by expanding to other areas. In his case,
he began talking about his own personal finances. Note that this was always with the caveat that
it's based on personal experience rather than some vast "official" expertise. </p><p>Once you build credibility in one domain, it becomes
easier to build it in others.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-block-type="2" id="block-b9f64a9b22f91d323d73"><p>In this post we're going to take a look at a way of comparing two probability distributions called Kullback-Leibler Divergence (often shortened to just KL divergence). Very often in Probability and Statistics we'll replace observed data or a complex distributions with a simpler, approximating distribution. KL Divergence helps us to measure just how much information we lose when we choose an approximation.</p></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_3_1494396184641_57224"><p>Let's start our exploration by looking at a problem. Suppose that we're space-scientists visiting a distant, new planet and we've discovered a species of biting worms that we'd like to study. We've found that these worms have 10 teeth, but because of all the chomping away, many of them end up missing teeth. After collecting many samples we have come to this empirical probability distribution of the number of teeth in each worm:</p></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_3_1494396184641_5321"><p><br>While this data is great, we have a bit of a problem. We're far from Earth and sending data back home is expensive. What we want to do is reduce this data to a simple model with just one or two parameters. One option is to represent the distribution of teeth in worms as just a uniform distribution. We know there are 11 possible values and we can just assign the uniform probability of \(\frac{1}{11}\) to each of these possibilities.&nbsp;</p></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_3_1494396184641_9620"><p>Clearly our data is not uniformly distributed, but it also doesn't look too much like any common distributions we know. Another option we could try would be to model our data using the <a href="https://www.countbayesie.com/blog/2015/3/17/interrogating-probability-distributions">Binomial distribution</a>. In this case all we need to do is estimate that probability parameter of the Binomial distribution. We know that if we have \(n\) trials and a probabily is \(p\) then the expectation is just \(E[x] = n \cdot p\). In this case \(n = 10\), and the expectation is just the mean of our data, which we'll say is 5.7, so our best estimate of p is 0.57. That would give us a binomal distribution that looks like this:</p></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_3_1494396184641_14237"><p>Comparing each of our models with our original data we can see that neither one is the perfect match, but which one is better?</p></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_3_1494396184641_18631"><div><p>There are plenty of existing error metrics, but our primary concern is with minimizing the amount of information we have to send. Both of these models reduce our problem to two parameters, number teeth and a probability (though we really only need the number of teeth for the uniform distribution). The best test of which is better is to ask which distribution preserves the most information from our original data source. This is where Kullback-Leibler Divergence comes in.</p><h2>The entropy of our distribution</h2><p>KL Divergence has its origins in information theory. The primary goal of information theory is to quantify how much information is in data. The most important metric in information theory is called Entropy, typically denoted as \(H\). The definition of Entropy for a probability distribution is:</p><p>$$H = -\sum_{i=1}^{N} p(x_i) \cdot \text{log }p(x_i)$$</p><p>If we use \(log_2\) for our calculation we can interpret entropy as "the minimum number of bits it would take us to encode our information". &nbsp;In this case, the information would be each observation of teeth counts given our empirical distribution. Given the data that we have observed, our probability distribution has an entropy of 3.12 bits.&nbsp;The number of bits tells us the lower bound for how many bits we would need, on average, to encode the number of teeth we would observe in a single case.</p><p>What entropy doesn't tell us is the optimal encoding scheme to help us achieve this compression. Optimal encoding of information is a very interesting topic, but not necessary for understanding KL divergence. The key thing with Entropy is that, simply knowing the theoretical lower bound on the number of bits we need, we have a way to quantify exactly how much information is in our data. Now that we can quantify this, we want to quantify how much information is lost when we substitute our observed distribution for a parameterized approximation.</p><h2>Measuring information lost using Kullback-Leibler Divergence</h2><p>Kullback-Leibler Divergence is just a slight modification of our formula for entropy. Rather than just having our probability distribution \(p\) we add in our approximating distribution \(q\). Then we look at the difference of the log values for each:</p><p>$$D_{KL}(p||q) = \sum_{i=1}^{N} p(x_i)\cdot (\text{log }p(x_i) - \text{log }q(x_i))$$</p><p><br>Essentially, what we're looking at with the KL divergence is the <a href="https://www.countbayesie.com/blog/2015/3/19/expectation-and-variance-from-high-school-to-grad-school">expectation</a> of the log difference between the probability of data in the original distribution with the approximating distribution. Again, if we think in terms of \(log_2\) we can interpret this as "how many bits of information we expect to lose". We could rewrite our formula in terms of expectation:</p><p>$$D_{KL}(p||q) = E[\text{log } p(x) - \text{log } q(x)]$$</p><p>The more common way to see KL divergence written is as follows:</p><p>$$D_{KL}(p||q) = \sum_{i=1}^{N} p(x_i)\cdot log\frac{p(x_i)}{q(x_i)}$$</p><p>since \(\text{log }a - \text{log b} = \text{log }\frac{a}{b}\).</p><p>With KL divergence we can calculate exactly how much information is lost when we approximate one distribution with another. Let's go back to our data and see what the results look like.</p><h2>Comparing our approximating distributions</h2><p>Now we can go ahead and calculate the KL divergence for our two approximating distributions. For the uniform distribution we find:</p><p>$$D_{kl}(\text{Observed } || \text{ Uniform}) = 0.338$$</p><p>And for our Binomial approximation:</p><p>$$D_{kl}(\text{Observed } || \text{ Binomial}) = 0.477$$</p><p>As we can see the <em>information lost</em> by using the Binomial approximation is greater than using the uniform approximation. If we have to choose one to represent our observations, we're better off sticking with the Uniform approximation.</p><h3>Divergence <em>not</em> distance</h3><p>It may be tempting to think of KL Divergence as a distance metric, however we cannot use KL Divergence to measure the <em>distance</em> between two distributions. The reason for this is that KL Divergence is <em>not symmetric</em>. For example we if used our observed data as way of approximating the Binomial distribution we get a very different result:</p><p>$$D_{kl}( \text{Binomial} || \text{Observed}) = 0.330$$<br>Intuitively this makes sense as in each of these cases we're doing a very different form of approximation.</p><h2>Optimizing using KL Divergence</h2><p>When we chose our value for the Binomial distribution we chose our parameter for the probability by using the expected value that matched our data. But since we're optimizing for minimizing information loss, it's possible this wasn't really the best way choose the parameter.&nbsp;We can double check our work by looking at the way KL Divergence changes as we change our values for this parameter. Here's a chart of how those values change together:</p></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_3_1494396184641_28671"><div><p><br>As you can see, our estimate for the binomial distribution (marked by the dot) was the best estimate to minimize KL divergence.</p><p>Suppose we wanted to create an ad hoc distribution to model our data.&nbsp;We'll split the data in two parts. The probabilities for 0-5 teeth and the probabilities for 6-10 teeth. Then we'll use a single parameter to specify what percentage of the total probability distribution falls on the right side of the distribution. For example if we choose 1 for our parameter then 6-10 will each have a probability of 0.2 and everything in the 0-5 group would have a probability of 0. So basically:</p><p>$$[6,11] = \frac{p}{5}; [0,5] = \frac{1-p}{6}$$</p><p>Note: Because \(log\) is undefined for 0, the only time we can allow probabilities that are zero is when \(p(x_i) = 0\) implies \(q(x_i) = 0\).</p><p>How could we find the optimal parameter for this strange model we put together? All we need to do is minimize KL divergence the same way we did before:</p></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_3_1494396184641_34372"><p><br>We find that the minimum value for KL Divergence is 0.338 found when \(p=0.47\). That value for the minimum KL divergence should look pretty familiar: it's nearly identical to the value we got from our uniform distribution! When we plot out the values of our ad hoc distribution with the ideal value for \(p\) we find that it is nearly uniform:</p></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_3_1494396184641_37635"><div><p>Since we don't save any information using our ad hoc distribution we'd be better off using a more familiar and simpler model.&nbsp;</p><p>The key point here is that we can use KL Divergence as an objective function to find the optimal value for any approximating distribution we can come up with. While this is example is only optimizing a single parameter, we can easily imagine extending this approach to high dimensional models with many parameters.</p><h2>Variational Autoencoders and Variational Bayesian methods</h2><p>If you are familiar with neural networks, you may have guessed where we were headed after the last section. Neural networks, in the most general sense, are function approximators. This means that you can use a neural network to learn a wide range of complex functions. The key to getting neural networks to learn is to use an objective function that can inform the network how well it's doing. You train neural networks by minimizing the loss of the objective function.&nbsp;</p><p>As we've seen, we can use KL divergence to minimize how much information loss we have when approximating a distribution. Combining KL divergence with neural networks allows us to learn very complex approximating distribution for our data. A common approach to this is called a "Variational Autoencoder" which learns the best way to approximate the information in a data set. Here is <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.05908">a great tutorial </a>that dives into the details of building variational autoencoders.</p><p>Even more general is the area of Variational Bayesian Methods. In other posts we've seen how powerful <a href="https://www.countbayesie.com/blog/2015/3/3/6-amazing-trick-with-monte-carlo-simulations">Monte Carlo simulations</a> can be to solve a range of probability problems. While Monte Carlo simulations can help solve many intractable integrals needed for Bayesian inference, even these methods can be very computationally expensive. Variational Bayesian method, including Variational Autoencoders, use KL divergence to generate optimal approximating distributions, allowing for much more efficient inference for very difficult integrals.

<p>The hardware and software worlds may seem poles apart, and in many ways, they indeed are. But there’s a wealth of knowledge that each can learn from the other. Despite the seemingly massive differences in the final product, they share more in common than you might expect. </p>



<p>Computer engineers at places like Intel, just like software engineers, spend most of their time sitting at their desks, writing (verilog) code that implements the desired system behavior. They then compile (synthesize) their code in order to generate lower-level outputs (digital circuits and physical layouts). And finally, they write automated tests that exercise their <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_under_test" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">SUT</a>, to ensure that the code is functionally correct. Sound familiar?</p>



<p>I know all this intimately, given my own past as a hardware engineer, and my later transition into software development. After finishing my Master’s degree in Computer Architecture, I spent over 5 years working at Intel and Sun as a Hardware Verification engineer, before turning down a senior-staff role at Apple, in order to reboot my career as a software developer.</p>



<p>In the past 5 years, I’ve worked in some great software teams at places like Google, and have also led development for multiple personal projects in my free time. The programmers that I’ve met and worked with are undoubtedly smart, and possess a number of skills that my hardware colleagues should strive to emulate. However, one thing I’ve noticed is that when it comes to testing, their instincts have been… off. Way off. </p>



<p>Here’s my attempt to distill the lessons I’ve learnt from my Hardware days, and how they can be applied to improve our Software testing methodologies and outcomes.</p>



<p><em>Disclaimer: this post is focused on non-UI programming, where functionality can be 100% covered without the need for “eyeballing”. Front-end/UI testing is a whole other beast that I wouldn’t comment on or touch with a ten foot pole.</em></p>







<p>The elephant in the room in most software companies, is the perceived importance of testing. In hardware, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://anysilicon.com/verification-validation-testing-asicsoc-designs-differences/" target="_blank">pre-silicon verification</a> is a first-class citizen in the development process. Dedicated verification engineers earn 6 figure salaries, sit next to their RTL design counterparts in all planning meetings, and enjoy careers that are just as prestigious and lucrative. In comparison, at most software companies I’ve come across, testing is treated as a 2nd class citizen – being a “test engineer” (or worse, “tester”) is often maligned as being less prestigious or lucrative.</p>



<p>This difference in culture isn’t an accident of nature. It’s a natural consequence of the much higher stakes in the hardware world. Because the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tape-out" target="_blank">tapeout</a> process is so expensive and time consuming, finding even a single bug can delay your product launch by months, and cost you millions of dollars in additional expenses. Or worse: finding a bug after your customers have already purchased and installed the chips, can result in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pentium_FDIV_bug" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="extremely expensive product recalls (opens in a new tab)">extremely expensive product recalls</a>. Even if the fix is a simple one-line code change.</p>



<p>The consequences of software bugs can certainly be disastrous. But at least the fix is extremely cheap logistically – code deployments and software patches are vastly faster and cheaper than manufacturing and distributing new silicon. Hence why hardware organizations take testing much more seriously than comparable software companies.</p>



<p>The results do speak for themselves. Hardware products that are in the hands of customers, have an order-of-magnitude fewer bugs. The percentage of bugs that are caught prior to release, is vastly higher in the hardware industry as compared to the software industry.</p>



<h4>A Better Way</h4>



<p>It is tempting to say that hardware teams are better at testing, purely because of their greater financial investment. That software teams are already operating at their most ideal, and that improvements in testing-quality can only be had through sacrifices in time/cost. </p>



<p>Such a view is unjustifiably optimistic about the current state of affairs, and pessimistic about our potential for improvement. Over the past decades we have vastly improved our software-development practices and methodologies. There’s no reason to believe that we have now achieved a state of nirvana where no further improvements are possible.</p>



<p>Even though many programmers tend to short change it, testing-methodology is itself a skill set. One that is learned over time by an entire industry, at a rate proportional to its level of investment. And in this sense, the hardware industry is miles ahead when it comes to testing best-practices. Not because they are “smarter” in any way, but simply because their survival depends on it.</p>



<p>You wouldn’t expect a football player to be able to jump as high as a basketball player.<br>You wouldn’t expect a restaurant to take cleanliness as seriously as a hospital.<br>You definitely shouldn’t expect a software organization to master testing best-practices, the way a hardware company has.</p>



<p>If you want to master the art of testing, talk to a hardware verification engineer.</p>







<h2>The 0th Law of Testing: Only the Paranoid Survive</h2>



<p>If it hasn’t been tested, it doesn’t work. <em><a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="“If this isn't absolutely true, it is certainly a good working assumption for project work.” (opens in a new tab)" href="http://www.hyperthot.com/pm_princ.htm" target="_blank">“If this isn’t absolutely true, it is certainly a good working assumption for project work.” </a></em>This rule forms the foundation for most other lessons listed here.</p>



<p>Word of Warning: The universe of all possible inputs and corner-cases is infinite. Hence, you will never attain 100% coverage via empirical testing. You will never cross the finish-line. If you ever think that you are “done” with testing, you’re in for a surprise. All you can do is chase as much coverage as can be attained, with the amount of time and resources available.</p>



<h2>Manual Testing is not good enough</h2>



<p>Things I’ve heard developers say:</p>



<p><em>“This is so important, that we have to test it manually. I don’t trust an automated test to do the job.”</em><br><em>“Don’t worry about trying to build automated tests. We’ve been manually testing these changes.”</em></p>



<p>What a Hardware engineer would say instead:</p>



<p><em>“This is so important, that we have to build an automated test suite for it. I don’t trust human testers to do the job.”</em><br><em>“Maybe run a few tests manually as a final sanity check, but don’t spend too much time since it’s been auto-tested pretty well.”</em></p>



<p>Running a couple tests by hand and eyeballing the results, might work in a college VLSI class. But it’s going to get you laughed at in industry. Manual testing cannot be code-reviewed on GitHub. Manual testing is subject to human error, whether due to oversight or laziness. Manual testing is extremely time and labor intensive, when subjected to every single release.</p>



<p>There might be specific exceptions where a test cannot be automated. But these should be the exception – not the norm. Reliability ultimately comes from the strength of your automated test suite, not how much manual testing you’re doing. Anything important enough to test by hand, is important enough to build an automated test suite for.</p>



<h2><strong>Testing Two Inputs in Isolation != Testing Them Together</strong></h2>



<figure><div>

</div></figure>



<p>Suppose your team is implementing and testing the following method:</p>


<pre title="">public static double myCustomDivider(double numerator, double divisor);
</pre>


<p>Alice:<em> “Do we have tests checking correct behavior for negative inputs?”</em><br>Bob:<em> “I have a test where the numerator is negative, and another test where the divisor is negative”</em><br>Alice: <em>“Do you have a 3rd test where they are both negative?”</em><br>Bob: <em>“No, and we don’t need that. We’ve already covered both cases individually.”</em></p>



<p>You laugh, but I’ve heard variations of this said far too many times, by far too many senior developers.</p>



<p>If the 2 inputs are completely decoupled, maybe it makes sense to assume we don’t need to test them in combination. But often times, 2 inputs which are assumed to be decoupled, aren’t nearly as decoupled as people think. And even if the implementation is indeed decoupled at the time of writing the test, it can often evolve to become coupled at a later time. As the saying goes: <em>“It ain’t what you don’t know that gets you into trouble. It’s what you know for sure that just ain’t so.”</em></p>



<p>As a general heuristic: If 2 inputs are both being parsed within the same method, there is definitely value in testing them in combination.</p>



<p>Perhaps you’ve decided that the risk-reward tradeoff merits not writing tests to cover some combinations. This is certainly a reasonable decision to make, depending on the particular project circumstances and the events being considered. But do so cognizant of the risk you’re taking on. Do not delude yourself into thinking that there’s no value in testing combinations of multiple events.</p>



<h2>Testing Output_A for Event_1 != Testing Output_A for Event_2</h2>



<p>Suppose you find yourself needing to test the following addPerson method:</p>


<pre title="">public int getAge(String name);
public int getHeight(String name);
public int getWeight(String name);

// Returns true if a previous value was overwritten
public boolean addPerson(Person person);
</pre>


<p>And so you write the following tests:</p>


<pre title="">@Test
public void addNewPerson_shouldReturnFalse() {
  Person person = new Person("john", 30, 175, 70);
  boolean result = system.addPerson(person);
  Truth.assertThat(result).isFalse();
  getAndCheckPerson(person);
}

@Test
public void addPerson_alreadyExists_shouldReturnTrue() {
  Person originalJohn = new Person("john", 30, 175, 70);
  system.addPerson(originalJohn);

  Person updatedJohn = new Person("john", 31, 174, 71);
  boolean result = system.addPerson(updatedJohn);

  Truth.assertThat(result).isTrue();
  getAndCheckPerson(updatedJohn);
}

private void getAndCheckPerson(Person person) {
  Truth.assertThat(system.getAge(person.name))
    .isEqualTo(person.age);
  Truth.assertThat(system.getHeight(person.name))
    .isEqualTo(person.height); 
  Truth.assertThat(system.getWeight(person.name))
    .isEqualTo(person.weight);

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-hook="post-description"><article><div><div data-rce-version="8.17.5"><div dir="ltr"><div><p id="viewer-foo"><span>A few streets away, there's this famous bakery. Before COVID-19 changed everything in 2020, the store was always full. Due to COVID-19 restrictions, they got shut down for a few weeks in Spring 2020. Customers weren't allowed to come in and order. These days only a handful of people can come in at a time. During sunny days, customers don't mind waiting outside in the queue. But on rainy days, rarely somebody drops by. It has been a massive hit for the business and still takes time to recover from it. </span></p><p id="viewer-b3ecc"><span><strong>Worst of all</strong>: They may get shut down again if cases rise. How could this business possibly survive in uncertain times? COVID-19 cases could rise again quickly, causing another shutdown.</span></p><p id="viewer-7uac9"><span>If we look at the situation from a birds-eye perspective, the bakery itself would be allowed to produce goods; the only restriction is customer contact. </span></p><p id="viewer-e8dpj"><span>Since the brick-and-mortar store is small, only one or two customers at a time could come inside. Also, the owner needs to keep staff safe, reducing contact with customers as much as possible. The long queues on sunny days prove that there's a demand for pastries and bread. Yet, it's unpleasant for customers to queue up, possibly having to wait for 20 minutes or longer, before it's their turn. On top of that comes the uncertainty of not knowing if their favorite pastry is still available once they can place an order.</span></p><p id="viewer-4km9g"><span>Now, if COVID-19 cases would rise again, no customer would be allowed to come inside the store. The only way of conducting business during these times would be curbside-pickup. Some customers have been trying to order ahead via phone. The staff answers the phone, takes their order, and prepares everything. Still, customers have to wait in line. Accepting orders via phone is taking away time from working off the queue. On top of that, it's error-prone, as sometimes customers are mumbling or order slips get lost. </span></p><p id="viewer-1nkek"><span>What could the bakery do instead? If order-ahead and curbside-pickup were the default mode of doing business, how could they optimize for a pleasant customer experience and secure the revenue they desperately need? As some of the customers ordered ahead via phone, let's start by making this process easier for the customers and less time consuming for the staff. Instead of calling ahead, it should be possible to place an order with the bakery even the night before. The customer could be sure they'd get their favorite bread and pastries the next morning, without a long time waiting and without risking unnecessary exposure to other people. Therefore, the bakery decides to use <a href="https://shopify.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Shopify</a> as its online storefront. Shopify allows them to put in all items they'd like to sell, together with pictures, descriptions, and allergy information. Customers can now choose their favorite items, pay online and show up the next morning for pickup.</span></p><p id="viewer-39m1o"><span>But what if all customers would come in at the same time to pick up their order? They would still have to queue up outside. Therefore, the bakery decides to have customers choose from pre-defined timeslots on the website, resulting in an orderly pickup procedure. Bonus: The bakery knows ahead of time what's in demand. Once the store goes live, the bakery starts to hang up large posters informing customers about the new online ordering system. Over the next few days, customers begin to place orders online, skipping the queue.</span></p><div id="viewer-3tcoh"><div><div data-hook="imageViewer" role="button" tabindex="0"><div role="img" aria-label="Bakery Online Order Instructions for Customers"><p><img data-pin-url="https://www.work-with-jan.com/post/digitalization-during-covid-times-a-case-study" data-pin-media="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/34782c_fab8a3bb01224cb09749f1440bd1e485~mv2.png/v1/fit/w_1000%2Ch_1000%2Cal_c/file.png" src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/34782c_fab8a3bb01224cb09749f1440bd1e485~mv2.png/v1/fit/w_300,h_300,al_c,q_5/file.png" alt="Bakery Online Order Instructions for Customers"></p></div><p><span dir="auto">Order ahead Poster in the Bakery</span></p></div></div></div><p id="viewer-5j2vb"><span>Of course, this is a fictional example.

<p>This week I had a discussion with one of my friends on how to choose a programming language. It was triggered by multiple discussions I had with our customers on their engineering strategy in the last six months and one question that came multiple times was should we use X programming language for our new initiatives. Some customers were thinking of moving from .NET stack to Java, some banks were thinking about moving to Golang because their technical leaders have watched Monzo talks on Golang, for some it was from Java to Kotlin, and some were thinking of dumping JavaScript for Typescript.</p>



<p>To come up with the answer I try to find answers to following questions in context of the organization:</p>



<ul><li>What is the maturity of the programming language with respect to its community and ecosystem? Should they spend their one innovation token on this language?</li><li>How easy it is to find available talent in the market for that programming language?&nbsp;</li><li>How easy it is for the organization to acquire production engineering know-how for a programming language?</li><li>What are the productivity and efficiency gains that can be achieved from using a programming language? Are those gains aligned with the organization goals?</li><li>What are the use-cases an organization wants to solve with the programming language?</li><li>What is the future of a programming language? For a big enterprise it is important if the language can last for a decade.</li><li>What is the learning curve of the programming language? Can existing staff be upskilled?</li></ul>



<p>There is no correct answer to these questions. Most engineering organizations will end up using multiple programming languages. For example an organization may choose Golang as a general purpose language to build backend services, Python for scripting and data related work, Typescript for building web frontend. It is also possible that an engineering organization might choose Python for building most services and for few where performance and efficiency is important it chooses Golang. I think the important point is defining a small list of programming languages for the organization and documenting when you will choose which programming language.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I use a decision matrix like the one shown below to come up with one possible answer. Depending on which factors are important to the organization they can give them weights and that will impact the score of the language. In the image shown below, language 1 is the winner.</p>



<figure><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/WGB2gGPDUN24IZXig5kZSGzKwcpwSIfP5dzPMp5gxTpIGw5g5rRlqcsWPSTYDY0QWf6U0D14oL9dfTeRZlDanEwK54XjJIirmMeIGTL62skChi8YxVTBZcpeJyRbnveFCKYW3d7U" alt=""></figure>



<p>As I was writing this post a few more questions came to my mind.&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li>Does a programming language help us write less buggy software?</li><li>Does a programming language have some constructs that help us reduce the essential complexity of the system?</li><li>What constraints does a programming language impose and how do they impact the business goals?</li><li>Can a programming language be a competitive advantage for an organization?</li><li>Can a programming language influence the quality of the development team, the quality of code, and practices they follow?</li><li>Does a programming language influence engineering organization culture?</li><li>Can a programming language over time help average Joe become a good software engineer?</li><li>What makes a programming language future safe? Can we predict it to safeguard us?</li><li>Should a language choice depend on NFRs that you want to achieve?</li><li>How does a programming language influence behavior of a team?</li></ul>



<p>I don’t have answers to all of the above mentioned questions. I am hoping there is academic research done on the above but I am yet to read those papers.</p>



<p>I did some research on why different organizations choose certain languages and I found the following key points.</p>



<ol><li>Gitlab – Ruby – <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2018/10/29/why-we-use-rails-to-build-gitlab/">Link</a><ul><li>GitHub, a source of inspiration for GitLab, was also based on Rails, making it a logical pick considering his interest in the framework.</li><li>Ruby on Rails ecosystem allows you to shape a lot of functionality at a high quality</li><li>We need a lot of functionality and Ruby on Rails is a way to do it</li><li>Consistent coding practices. You are guided to do the right thing.</li><li>Big community of Ruby gems</li></ul></li><li>CockroachDB – Golang – <a href="https://www.cockroachlabs.com/blog/why-go-was-the-right-choice-for-cockroachdb/">Link</a><ul><li>its support for libraries, interfaces, and tooling positioned it as the right choice for CockroachDB</li><li>Go was designed to scale to large code bases with an emphasis on simplicity and orthogonality of features. The enforced code style, the simple imports and automated import management, the wide variety of linters, the straightforward (and minimal) set of programmatic idioms…all of these attributes of Go are important for clean, understandable code.</li><li>When comparing to Java, we appreciate the tight focus on implementation instead of OOP and abstraction: interfaces can be added when needed, not as an initial, often unnecessary, step.&nbsp;</li><li>When comparing to C++, we appreciate automatic memory management and how there’s rarely more than one way to get something done, for example with static and one-time initializers.</li><li>Go gives better control over memory allocation that impacts garbage collection.</li></ul></li><li>Asana – TypeScript – <a href="https://blog.asana.com/2014/11/asana-switching-typescript/">Link</a><ul><li>Clean JS</li><li>Community Support</li><li>Errors at compile time instead of runtime</li><li>Static typing</li></ul></li><li>American Express – Golang – <a href="https://go.dev/solutions/americanexpress/">Link</a> and <a href="https://americanexpress.io/choosing-go/">Link</a><ul><li>For their assessment, they chose to build a microservice in four different programming languages. They then compared the four languages for speed/performance, tooling, testing, and ease of development.</li><li>While Go may not have been the fastest language tested, its powerful tooling helped bolster its overall results. Go’s built-in testing framework, profiling capabilities, and benchmarking tools impressed the team.</li><li>Reasons<ul><li>Simple and straightforward</li><li>Encourage best practices</li><li>Concurrency</li><li>Tooling</li></ul></li></ul></li><li>Nubank – Clojure – <a href="https://building.nubank.com.br/working-with-clojure-at-nubank/">Link</a><ul><li>Nubank provides services in the finance domain, which is very close to mathematical functions — and functional programming is an excellent fit for both scenarios.</li><li>Clojure, on the other hand, has simple constructs that allow us to focus on the problem we are solving, making evolving the system a small incremental challenge, which doesn’t get that much harder over time.</li><li>Most of our codebase can be understood locally, looking at any given pure function, understanding its outputs for any given set of inputs. There’s rarely any need to reason about or recreate the internal state of objects. Data moves through the system in a composable, inspectable, consistent, and immutable way (without hiding it inside of objects).</li><li>Functional code is much easier to test, and that gives us the confidence to deploy an average of over 50 changes per day in a mission-critical domain.</li><li>Nubank has acquired Cognitect, the US-based software consultancy behind the Clojure programming language and the Datomic database</li></ul></li><li>Janestreet – Ocaml – <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1CmGbOGb2I">Link</a> , <a href="https://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?id=2038036">Link</a> , and <a href="https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/does-jane-street-use-other-programming-languages-aside-from-ocaml/2761/5">Link</a><ul><li>Brevity of the language and the powerful type system that makes OCaml code very readable</li><li>Powerful abstraction capabilities that reduce boilerplates</li><li>Static type system for ensuring code correctness</li><li>He spoke about some of the fancy type tricks like parametric polymorphism, algebraic data types, type inference, phantom types and type indexed values that add to the expressivity of code.</li><li>Also OCaml hits the sweet spot between expressiveness of code and the performance numbers. The very much tunable GC makes things easier to control.</li></ul></li><li>Starling Bank – Java – <a href="https://www.infoq.com/presentations/starling-bank/">Link</a><ul><li>Exceptions are noisy and difficult to ignore</li><li>Reliable ecosystem (user base, tooling, job market, etc)&nbsp;</li><li>Integrations with legacy third parties (SOAP etc)</li></ul></li><li>KhanAcademy – Golang – <a href="https://blog.khanacademy.org/go-services-one-goliath-project/">Link</a><ul><li>Kotlin was more performant</li><li>Golang used much less memory</li></ul></li><li>Lyft – TypeScript – <a href="https://eng.lyft.com/typescript-at-lyft-64f0702346ea">Link</a><ul><li>Popularity</li><li>Type safety</li><li>Less Bugs</li><li>Productivity</li></ul></li><li>Medium – Golang – <a href="https://medium.engineering/rex-mediums-go-recommendation-microservice-e077bc9582a">Link</a><ul><li>More efficient use of the CPU. While Node is single-threaded, Go is much better suited for the combination of I/O and CPU-intensive operations required to build a ranked feed. Splitting our work onto separate Goroutines means we can avoid the issue of the CPU getting hogged by one single request and other requests getting starved.</li><li>Opinionated. Go makes it pretty hard to write “bad” code. A typed language that is also highly opinionated in terms of code styling means that even a newbie to Go (which I was when we started writing Rex) can quickly start writing clean and readable code.</li><li>Prior experience with Go. While much of Medium’s codebase is written in Node, we already had a few smaller-purpose microservices in Go. Adding another microservice in a language that we as a company have familiarity with makes building and maintaining this new service much easier.</li></ul></li><li>Instagram – Python – <a href="https://instagram-engineering.com/web-service-efficiency-at-instagram-with-python-4976d078e366">Link</a><ul><li>Simplicity</li><li>Practicality</li></ul></li></ol>



<p>I hope this post helps you understand that there is much more to choosing a programming language.</p>

          <p>February 12, 2021</p>

<p>Monty Python’s “Bicycle Repair Man” is a fitting allegory for the information security industry. It is filled with supermen and -women who fight bad guys with their super powers, such as threat hunting, attribution and TTPs. The big question however is, are enough of us looking after our own infrastructure, our “bicycles”?</p>

<p>The SolarWinds case is no different, as in the heat of the moment everybody is focused on attributing the malice and all things related. My position is that in addition, we should also pay attention to what may have led into this situation, which oftentimes simply is poor security posture due to a failure in people, processes or technology.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Even more precisely, the crux of the problem often lies in poor IT processes related to patching, access control or other “boring stuff”, such as keeping X.509 certificates from expiring.</p>

<h2 id="how-dare-you-say-that-out-loud">How dare you say that out loud?</h2>

<p>Simply, because for more than a decade I’ve been helping people in their mission to reduce incidence of suspected compromise, publicly exposed vulnerable services or open services which may be unintentionally exposed to the Internet - at nation scale and through automation.</p>



<p>SolarWinds is a company, whose mission is to make the IT administration simpler and more secure at scale. This is a great mission and I fault the company not with what they have built or how secure their products are.</p>

<p>The challenge seems to be the fact how well they have their own people, processes and technology in line with what they enable their customers to achieve through their products.</p>

<h2 id="can-you-show-me-the-proof">Can you show me the proof?</h2>

<p>Yes, as the proof is in the open for everyone to see. Look at their publicly available network assets and connect the dots between the assets and known vulnerabilities observed through Shodan. I did this with the help of our research into 86 specific known and vetted issues on Shodan and matched the data against the SolarWinds assets and the picture is quite clear and unflattering.</p>

<h2 id="why-are-you-singling-them-out">Why are you singling them out?</h2>

<p>Their case is actual and well known and if a tragedy on such a scale can contribute to the common good, then we should seize the opportunity. On 2021-01-12, we reached out to SolarWinds to confirm that the network assets we used for the evaluation actually belong to them. We even offered them the findings to help them mitigate them. Unfortunately, they did not respond to our requests and we are now publishing our results in this blog post.</p>

<p>Given the constraints I lay out below, they clearly have not done their due diligence and as a result we have this mess, where threat actors must have had a field day in gaining initial access to the company - no zero days needed.</p>

<p>I implore you to reflect that in addition to threat signatures and TTPs about the malice, we need to start looking at the security posture of organizations as well - and not just after a high profile breach such as this one. The information I present below after all, is public and most likely used by threat actors every single day.</p>

<p>Furthermore, the vulnerabilities I detail below, plague most organizations on the Internet. Picking three prominent US defense contractors at random, I found most of the same issues related to their network assets as well, namely General Dynamics, Harris Corporation or Northrop Grumman.</p>

<h2 id="so-whats-the-evidence">So what’s the evidence?</h2>

<p>As stated above, I used the 86 vetted queries from Shodan against the publicly available network asset information related to SolarWinds. In essence, I used the same approach as the cyber rating companies do, which means that they rely in large part on publicly available IP network registration information when producing their ratings of you.</p>

<p>To be reproducible, the uncertainties related to the interpretation of the results must at least account for the following four things:</p>

<ol>
  <li>That the network asset in question belongs to the right party, which in this case study should be SolarWinds.</li>
  <li>That the service in question may be honeypot, whose intention is to monitor for scanning and/or exploitation of the emulated service.</li>
  <li>That the service implementation based version matching suffers from patch backporting, which means that the detection or assessment method cannot solely rely on a simple version banner.</li>
  <li>That the party doing the interpretation has to be able to understand the impact, as just having all the Shodan matches against a network asset alone makes interpretation difficult in practice.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="what-are-the-observations-then">What are the observations then?</h2>

<p>In this case, I used evidence from the last 6 months mapped against the publicly available network asset attributable to SolarWinds. Mapping the 86 topics against those assets with automation, I was able to detect seven distinct vulnerabilities in their infrastructure, as follows:</p>

<p><img src="https://d1qmdf3vop2l07.cloudfront.net/swell-rail.cloudvent.net/hash-store/0f84f98834724a9d07eea6fba20806d4.png" alt="" width="1390" height="532" data-cms-original-src="/images/content/image1-1.png"></p>

<h4 id="expired-x509">Expired X.509</h4>

<p>If you have ever done systems administration of any type of Internet facing services, you have battled against time and expiration of X.509 certificates, which prove the identity of your service to its users. You’re probably thinking right now that wait, we should be talking about vulnerabilities, about CVEs, right? Remote code execution, the sexy stuff. My favorite retort to that is the following: the Equifax data breach which exposed the PII of 147 million people was largely caused by expired X.509 certificates in critical monitoring systems.&nbsp;</p>

<p>shodan dork: ssl.cert.expired:true&nbsp;</p>

<h4 id="sslv2">SSLv2&nbsp;</h4>

<p>The arms race against crypt analysis has accelerated over the past couple of years. This means that cryptographic hashes or ciphers perfectly acceptable five years ago have become obsolete. SSL version 2 is a cryptographic protocol, which hasn’t met the requirement for Internet facing services for even longer. Its use was prohibited by RFC 6167 in 2011.&nbsp;</p>

<h4 id="exposed-snmp">Exposed SNMP&nbsp;</h4>

<p>Simple Network Management Protocol is very handy for gathering low-level information about networked devices and their status, especially in the switch and router space. As demonstrated by OUSPG PROTOS project in 2002, SNMP, whatever the version, is not and will not be a protocol fit for the Internet. Access to SNMP implementations must be access controlled to those devices, which are under your control, no matter which version of the protocol the device is speaking. Google “c06-snmp test suite” and assess the ramifications yourself, if you need more background on the issue. Moreover, threat actors have abused SNMP for reflected DDoS attacks for years, since sending a single spoofed UDP packet with the source address of the target will yield a huge amplification factor to their DDoS traffic.</p>

<h4 id="exposed-telnet">Exposed Telnet&nbsp;</h4>

<p>Before the advent of SSH, telnet was the de facto protocol for remote management or shell access to systems or devices. In 1995, a Finnish engineer called Tatu Ylönen invented SSH, which made the telnet obsolete overnight. 25 years later, however, telnet is still going strong for some reason. There simply is not any Internet facing use case for the service, period.&nbsp;</p>

<h4 id="exposed-mysql">Exposed MySQL&nbsp;</h4>

<p>Even if MySQL database engine is the de facto component as a backend service for many an Internet facing service, exposing it directly to the Internet without any further access control in front of it is inviting disaster. Recently, there was a major data breach in Finland, which allegedly resulted from the database backend being directly exposed to the Internet without any further access control in front of it. Layered security is not just a fancy buzz word. In many cases the database backend doesn’t even need to be reachable over the network at all, but when it does, access to it must be locked down to only those hosts, which actually need it.</p>

<h4 id="cve-2015-0204-aka-freak">CVE-2015-0204 a.k.a. FREAK</h4>

<p>Compliance with US cryptographic export controls lies at the heart of this vulnerability. An Internet facing service simply should not support negotiation of an encrypted connection, which is possible to decipher using $100 worth of cloud computing resources. We could even rename this vulnerability, man-in-the-middle made easy.</p>

<p>Exim is a popular Mail Transfer Agent, MTA, used in many mostly linux-based servers. It has had a mottled history with information security and in 2019, a serious flaw was discovered in it, which leads to remote code execution.

<h2 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h2>

<p>I know maintaining and repairing “bicycles” is tedious. This work, however, is the thing that will keep you safer and make it more difficult for the threat actors to attack you. I’m not saying that the threat actor’s initial access in the case of SolarWinds could’ve been prevented by addressing the specific issues I highlighted above, but it would’ve made it more difficult.</p>

<p>Building security in and making it layered is the only foundation you can build on that gives you predictability in a much more coherent way than investing in the magic security technology X that exploits the hype of the day. Building security in, means investing in people and processes as well.</p>

<p>One of the big challenges is that this type of information security work is not viewed as glorious or sought …</p></div></div>

                    <p>Much has been covered about developer salaries based on coding language, location, job title, and so on. However, little has been done to chart the rise and fall of developer salaries over the years.</p><p>Tracing developer salaries over the last 20 years was an interesting endeavor. Researching the topic meant changing the language I used to search for data. <br>Back in the early 2000s, tech and software were referred to as “Information Technology” (IT) or “Information and Communications Technology” (ICT), developers were still referred to as “IT workers” and little was mentioned about the many specialized roles we have today.</p><p>To go back in time, I mainly referred to data published by the <a href="https://www.bls.gov/oes/tables.htm">U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics</a> as they offered the most comprehensive year on year data. I looked at data from alternate years, from 2001 to 2019.</p><h2 id="starting-in-the-year-2000">Starting in the year 2000</h2><p>At the turn of the century, <a href="https://money.cnn.com/2000/07/21/career/q_degreecompsci/">CNN Money</a> reported that the average starting salary for an entry-level computer programmer was $40,800.</p><p>Fresh graduates were also paid differently based on the degrees they held:</p><ul><li>Computer engineering: $49,505</li><li>Computer science: $48,740</li><li>Information science: $38,900</li><li>Management information systems: $41,800</li></ul><p>Due to the shortage of skilled workers going into tech fields, salaries in America for IT graduates became more and more competitive. Salaries in 2000 were already 10% higher than the previous year and, apart from information science majors, were well above the <a href="https://www.naceweb.org/job-market/compensation/salary-trends-through-salary-survey-a-historical-perspective-on-starting-salaries-for-new-college-graduates">national average starting salary</a> of $39,824.</p><figure><img src="https://codesubmit.io/blog/content/images/2021/02/cs-grads-2000-2.png"><figcaption>The "IT Industry" looked different in 2000 than it does today</figcaption></figure><p>The following table shows the average annual salary for developers, programmers, and other IT-related job functions, across all industries in the year 2000:</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><table>

That year, while wages did not fall despite the dot-com burst, around 400,000 Americans working in IT-related roles lost their jobs going into 2001.</p><p>2008 was when the stock market crashed. Similar to the dot-com burst in 2001, wages in 2008 remained relatively unchanged. However, roughly 111,000 Americans working in IT-related fields lost their jobs going into 2009. </p><p>2008 was also the year when wages began to increase at a slower rate compared to previous years. While individuals enjoyed an average of $5,000 increase every two years previously, after 2008, wages only increased by $2,000 every two years. </p><p>Generally speaking, from 2001 to 2011, individuals working in tech had at least a 21% increase in wages over time.

<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><h2 id="what-to-expect-in-the-future">What to expect in the future</h2><p>In the years to come, industry experts expect <a href="https://medium.com/predict/are-programmers-headed-toward-another-bursting-bubble-528e30c59a0e">low-level coding and programming jobs to become obsolete</a> with the development of new tools that remove the need to code completely. Take for example the role of Web Developers when it comes to building websites. With popular CMS tools like WordPress and Squarespace, almost anyone can build a website for their business, reducing the need for people who know “just a little bit of front end web development”. </p><p>As automation takes away the need for “basic” coding jobs, new skills or a combination of skills will be needed in the future for roles that don’t even exist yet. The need for field experts and true problem solvers will never disappear. The key is to adapt and learn as new technologies emerge. </p><p><strong>Additional sources:</strong><br><a href="http://www.oecd.org/digital/ieconomy/1939833.pdf">OECD Technology Outlook Report 2000</a><br><a href="http://www.oecd.org/sti/ieconomy/37620123.pdf">OECD Technology Outlook Report 2004</a><br><a href="https://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/docserver/it_outlook-2010-sum-en.pdf?expires=1612698150&amp;id=id&amp;accname=guest&amp;checksum=7DC9765AA37510F78D7BBDA7FF42254D">OECD Information Technology Outlook Summary 2010</a><br><a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1iGfVr1j-VStKVwSWvVvSo3qbwwHTL_V9tPttpeBTmK4/edit?usp=sharing">BLS data in Google Sheets</a></p>

<p><strong>Vidal: </strong>[00:00] Good morning today I have with me, Kan Yilmaz. Welcome to ManagersClub.</p>



<p><strong>Kan: </strong>[00:06] Thank you, Vidal.</p>



<h2>About Metrics</h2>



<p><strong>Vidal: </strong>[00:07] Kan you are an expert in engineering metrics. I was really impressed that the discussion we had about engineering metrics last week. Could you tell people how did you get so interested in engineering metrics?</p>



<p><strong>Kan: </strong>[00:20] It wasn’t specifically about engineering metrics. What made me interested in this topic was there were engineers, and we are proud to say that we are logical. We acknowledge data, and we make decisions better based off of data. But once we look into an engineering organization, the application yes, we have lots of data, and we make really good decisions on the application. </p>



<p>But once we go into the process of how do we actually do this engineering process? We don’t have the data, and we don’t use anything. Everything is mostly based on gut feeling. And that made me uncomfortable. I wanted to figure out why engineering among all different organizational teams, such as sales or marketing, did not use any data, whereas every single other one did. So I went into that problem, and that led me to metrics itself.</p>



<p><strong>Vidal: </strong>[01:19] How long have you been working in this field of engineering data and metrics?</p>



<p><strong>Kan: </strong>[01:24] So I had been working on this for more than a year and a half full-time talking to people of understanding why they are using metrics. What is the reason and how does it make our lives better?</p>



<h2>The Goal of Metrics</h2>



<p><strong>Vidal: </strong>[01:39] What is the goal of metrics? Why should we care about these?</p>



<p><strong>Kan: </strong>[01:43] Why do we track anything? Why do we have metrics? The base reason is to align people to a specific goal. For companies, this is revenue. We have a single goal, to make sure that the company is profitable. That is our metric to track.</p>



<p>And this goes into every different even if you’re like having, let’s say you want to lose weight, you have a goal. And the metric represents that, which is how many kilos are you at the moment? For engineering, this was missing. So I was really interested in what should the engineering organization track.</p>



<p><strong>Vidal: </strong>[02:21] You’ve also spoken with hundreds of engineering managers.&nbsp; And that’s how we connected. What are some common mistakes or misunderstandings that managers have on this topic?</p>



<h2>Common Mistakes</h2>



<p><strong>Kan: </strong>[02:32] So there are a few mistakes that they do. The first one is the obvious one, which is big brother. You’re tracking all of my actions, and that sounds like big brother. You don’t want to be tracked — it feels from an engineer’s perspective, it doesn’t feel good. And there’s a reason for this. People have tracked engineers with the wrong metrics. There’s this guy called <a href="https://amzn.to/39W8NhG" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow">Eliyahu Goldratt. He wrote the book, The Goal.</a> And in his book, he specifically mentioned that <strong>if you track anybody with metrics that can not control that they won’t care.</strong></p>



<div><figure><a href="https://amzn.to/2N4jp5f" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/519C2Gz-v2L.jpg" alt="" data-src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/519C2Gz-v2L.jpg" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="></a></figure></div>



<p>And that is what happens in engineering metrics. They try to track engineers with metrics that they don’t control. That is the biggest mistake that I have seen. The second biggest mistake is tracking metrics, which doesn’t and result into the organization success. </p>



<p>So an example of this is the number of commits. That has no correlation whatsoever with the company’s success, and a lot of companies track the number of commits and other ones lines of code. These are numbers. You can track them, but it doesn’t mean anything, and it won’t make your company successful because of this. The engineers themselves —&nbsp; they know it internally. They know that it doesn’t represent the company’s success and they feel like “I’m just being tracked by an arbitrary number.” And it goes back into something that doesn’t matter. </p>



<p>So you need to make sure that you’re tracking two different things. One is that the team can control those metrics. The second point is those metrics actually align with the company’s goals.</p>



<p><strong>Vidal: </strong>[04:13] I think that’s a great point. Yes. If you can’t really control the metric, what do you, what are you going to do? Just pray that it changes? </p>



<h2>Two Best Practices</h2>



<p><strong>Vidal:</strong> We talked about some of the mistakes people make. What do you understand to be some of the best practices? What should people do?</p>



<p><strong>Kan: </strong>[04:26] Specifically for engineering teams, I will be by default, I’ll mention about product engineering. That is where we have figured out what metrics to track. I don’t know about R &amp; D or other departments of engineering, so there’s a distinction between that for product engineering, what are the best practices of tracking.</p>



<p>It goes into the team level. <strong>If you track the individual level, what happens usually is you don’t get the signal of the process. You get the signal of the person, and it’s a shaky number.</strong> A person might work hard today, but tomorrow they might do design, and the next day they might actually have lots of meetings.</p>



<p>And if you try to track it by a single number, you’ll get lots of spiky graphs and that won’t result into actionable results. But if you do that in team level, You will actually get a really good understanding of what the process is. And if I do any kind of iteration in my process, you can see that change in that team’s habits and in that team’s metrics. So that is one best practice that I can say. <strong>Don’t track individuals, track teams</strong>. </p>



<p>The second best practice is, this goes into the mistakes as well, make sure that the team can control the metric itself. Most of the teams that I have seen tried to put product metrics inside engineering organizations.</p>



<p>How I will describe it in this way, monthly active users. I have seen quite a few engineering teams being judged on monthly active users. There are other metrics such as JIRA tasks completed, or it’s usually goes into story points completed. Story points completed is again, it looks fine. You think that it represents the delivery of that specific team.</p>



<p>The problem with story points is it’s inaccurate. It’s inaccurate because the engineers do not fill it in at the correct time. And this produces such a chaotic environment where you don’t get actionable insights from tracking story points to be able to do that. </p>



<p>There is a workaround. It’s not like you cannot do it. You can do it. You need to make sure that story points are accurate and people are not gaming. So there are, those are a bit hard problems to solve. I have seen people solving those problems but <strong>I would generally recommend not tracking product-related metrics for engineering.</strong></p>



<p>There are much, much better metrics to track.&nbsp; We can go over that if you want.</p>



<h2>Metrics for Product Engineering Teams</h2>



<p><strong>Vidal: </strong>[07:00] I’d like to. I think that’s a great point you make about confusing the product metrics.&nbsp; What are some of the appropriate metrics to track for product engineering teams?</p>



<p><strong>Kan: </strong>[07:10] Okay. Let’s go from the fundamentals again. Back to the conversational starting point. I said the metrics they need to represent organization success. What that means is decreased churn, increased revenue. What metrics represent this? </p>



<p>In product engineering, imagine a car. This is the product itself, the organization itself. The driver is the product manager. They can make decisions on where to go on the road. But they don’t decide on the speed. The speed is decided by engineering.&nbsp;The engineering organization is the engine of this car. And how do we make sure that the car goes fast?</p>



<p>That is the <strong>number of successful iterations</strong>. <strong>That is the core metric that product engineering teams should track</strong>. What does the number of successful iterations mean? The number of iterations is quite obvious in the sense of, okay, if I do a deployment, then I did an iteration. I gave value to customers. </p>



<p>But if you just track that metric, what happens is we have seen this in multiple companies. The engineering manager says, “Hey let’s iterate faster. How can we iterate faster?” And the team response. “Let’s not write&nbsp;tests. We spend 20% of our time writing tests…” and that doesn’t work out. Then you have a faulty product.</p>



<p>It’s not a successful iteration. The customer didn’t get value from that deployment. You need to make sure that the iteration is fast and it’s successful. So what are the metrics to track these? I would Put this into five different metrics.&nbsp; I’ll take one step back. I’ll represent this into two different categories.</p>



<p>One product engineering, second DevOps team. I will focus on product engineering and they have four different metrics. It divides into speed and quality. Just like I said, number of successful iterations. The speed part is deployment frequency and cycle time. <strong>Deployment frequency</strong> is how often do you deploy? That’s quite obvious by itself. </p>



<p>Then we go to <strong>cycle time</strong>. Cycle time can be tracked into different ways. Some people track it from JIRA, a single task. How long did it take for a single JIRA task to complete? The second way to track it is how long did a single pull request take to complete by complete I mean start to deployment.</p>



<p>In pull request, you can do this by first commits to production. In JIRA, it can start from triaged to production as well one nuance there is the JIRA. One might not be accurate because engineers it’s like an extra process.&nbsp; It’s not in their habits to track.</p>



<p>Make sure that the JIRA task is correctly tagged, but Github one pull requests. It’s in their habit, it’s in their workflow. They make sure that pull request is tagged correctly because they don’t actually control the tag. They just behave normally and you can get that data from it. So I would recommend specifically focusing on pull requests, but JIRA is also a way to track cycle time.</p>



<p>So what I have talked about was speed, deployment frequency, and cycle time. Now we can go to <strong>quality metrics</strong>, which also divides into two different categories. The pair of deployment frequency is hotfixes. It is called <strong>change failure rates</strong>…</p></div></article></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Why learning to code has been one of the best choices I’ve ever made.</p><p>At a macro level, <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424053111903480904576512250915629460">software is eating the world</a>. The top 5 most valuable companies in the world (AAPL, MSFT, AMZN, FB, GOOGL) are all squarely situated in software. Antithetically (at a micro level), addictive software is eating lives with bottomless time vacuums of content that has little to no substance.</p><p>I think <a href="https://kylegill.com/blog/2020-11-13-in-defense-of-digital-minimalism/">technology is a two edged sword</a>, and like most things, software is neither entirely good nor entirely bad.</p><p>If software and its near infinite scale is taking over, it feels like a unique sort of superpower to be able to harness it. <strong>The easiest route to making software work for you, and not against you, is learning how to code</strong>. I want to give some examples of how learning to write software on my own has helped me craft improvements into my own life. Finding out I enjoyed writing code—and that companies will pay me for it—were delightful side effects to what was a really a new found freedom to build whatever I wanted.</p><h2 id="software-as-a-craft"><a href="#software-as-a-craft" aria-label="software as a craft permalink"></a>Software as a Craft</h2><p>When I get asked what I do when I’m off work, the answer is usually <em>the same thing I do at work</em>, <del>play minesweeper</del> write code. Something interesting to me is that that answer is <em>not particularly unique among software engineers</em>. It’s a craft that many engineers seem to hone outside of work because they actually enjoy it. Like a chef going home from work and cooking for their family, I tend to go home and write code that’s just for me. This surfaces itself in all sorts of projects and tools that I’ll go into in more depth later.</p><p>In all my attempts to convince my friends why I love programming—and why they should learn to program—I can’t seem to articulate this message well enough (which is part of the purpose of this essay). Software is a craft that is rewarding to improve.</p><h2 id="controlling-a-superpower"><a href="#controlling-a-superpower" aria-label="controlling a superpower permalink"></a>Controlling a Superpower</h2><p>As much as software is a craft, I also mentioned learning to code is like a superpower. Interestingly, I ran into a piece from Nil Eyal who <a href="https://genius.com/Nir-eyal-hooked-how-to-build-habit-forming-products-annotated">quoted a reader of his blog</a> who stated:</p><blockquote><p>If it can’t be used for evil, it’s not a superpower.</p></blockquote><p>I find this defintion fascinating because it squarely fits the bill for programming. The same network protocols, databases, and open source code that deliver petabytes of addictive media for the profit of developers, set up mechanisms for positive endeavors like disaster relief. Just as there <a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/2.11?lang=eng">is an opposition in all things</a>, a developer has the liberty to build a platform for vitriol and sludge or one that magnifies the best parts of technology.</p><p>Just like a chef has to be aware of different ingredients to cook, software engineers need to be aware of tools to code with. Learning to code has a stigma for being hard to pick up because it’s not easy to understand what’s possible. There was one line of code in particular that helped me understand what was possible, and it came to me as a conniving high schooler with free time in my computer drafting class. My friend and I stumbled across 2 very interesting discoveries one day:</p><ol><li>there’s a command to open a computer’s CD drive</li><li>all the computers in the school were connected through the network</li></ol><p>On their own neither of those is that ground-breaking, but when you combine them… well 😎. We were popping CD trays of our classmates left and right with reckless abandon. Finding the shutdown command was when we began to feel the responsibility inherent in our new power.</p><p>Code is all about synthesizing the existing tools in the software tool belt into new and interesting uses. That application of tools in the right steps allows software companies to do things like <a href="https://stripe.com/">process financial transactions</a>, <a href="https://www.gatsbyjs.com/">generate entire websites</a>, or <a href="https://numpy.org/">run complex equations</a> automatically. Unfortunately, some choose to use their skill for less worthy causes, but being able to build <em>good</em> things can meaningfully improve lives (including your own).</p><p>For the software engineer, knowing how to use those tools (and what tools there are) opens up the door to <a href="https://www.home-assistant.io/">home automation</a>, <a href="https://pi-hole.net/">blocking all ads from their home internet</a>, or in my case a suite of personal apps for the things I do from day to day.</p><h2 id="building-my-own-solutions"><a href="#building-my-own-solutions" aria-label="building my own solutions permalink"></a>Building my own Solutions</h2><p>At work I build tools for the aforementioned macro level, where my code is used for a whole bunch of random denizens of the internet. At the end of the day the real magic happens, I get to dive into the micro world and build tools <em>for me</em>.</p><p>The following are some things I’ve made outside of work that make software more than just a job for me:</p><h3 id="a-personal-journal"><a href="#a-personal-journal" aria-label="a personal journal permalink"></a>A Personal Journal</h3><p>Because <a href="https://notes.kylegill.com/journals">I really value journaling</a> and <a href="https://notes.kylegill.com/writing">writing things down</a>, I made myself a journal that had all the features I wanted but couldn’t find anywhere else. It works without internet, it supports dark/light mode depending on the time of day, it’s search-able, and best of all makes it easy for me to write in my journal from anywhere because it’s easily accessible from my phone or laptop (unlike my written journals). Then because software is great like that, I put it online so anyone can install their own version of it for free: <a href="https://github.com/gillkyle/sol-journal">https://github.com/gillkyle/sol-journal</a></p><p><span>

Finding a better way to store a lot of the ideas I was thinking about made sense in a home grown wiki where I could move all my content wherever I wanted, and build little features I wanted on top of it. Everything I record is automatically grouped by topic, making it easier to find what I want and add more to ideas I’ve been thinking about in the past.

<p>Not just <a href="https://www.joinclubhouse.com/">Clubhouse</a> itself, but the specific social audio network format and ease of use that it pioneered.</p>



<p>As more traditional forms of media continue to see declines, people are increasingly looking to newer, more digital native forms of media like social networks, online streaming services, and podcasts, which have seen <a href="https://www.statista.com/chart/10713/podcast-listeners-in-the-united-states/">steady growth over time</a>.</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="700" height="569" src="https://vancelucas.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-11-at-12.18.44-PM-700x569.png" alt="" srcset="https://vancelucas.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-11-at-12.18.44-PM-700x569.png 700w, https://vancelucas.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-11-at-12.18.44-PM-250x203.png 250w, https://vancelucas.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-11-at-12.18.44-PM-768x624.png 768w, https://vancelucas.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-11-at-12.18.44-PM-120x98.png 120w, https://vancelucas.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-11-at-12.18.44-PM.png 1444w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px"></figure></div>



<h2>Clubhouse vs. Podcasts</h2>



<p>A lot of traditional talk-radio style shows have migrated to podcasts, but they are a decidedly different format. The are generally planned, formatted, edited, polished, and then released at a later date. They don’t generally have the same feel as live talk shows, with the exception of a handful of podcasts which are just recordings of live conversations.</p>



<p>But even if the podcast is a full live conversation that is simply recorded, since they are not also <em>broadcast</em> live (and can thus be edited before release), the same level of listener trust isn’t there for podcasts.</p>



<h2>Lower Barrier for Creators</h2>



<p>Another thing that Clubhouse does brilliantly is significantly lower the barrier for participation and creation of audio content, especially when compared to podcasting. Anyone can create a room, invite others, and just start talking. If it’s interesting and attracts more listeners, it rises to the top. You are free to do this whenever you want, and many of the top channels occur on a regular basis at the same times every day – just like talk radio. All for free.</p>



<p>Now compare what it takes to publish a podcast. You have recording, equipment costs, editing, hosting (which is not free), transcription (optional), and distribution through iTunes, Spotify, Soundcloud, etc. among others. And even after you have done all that, building the audience for it is much more difficult, and discovery or new content is not as built-in as it is on Clubhouse.</p>



<p>The limitations of Clubhouse being a mobile app also effectively level the playing field. Podcasting setups can get pretty intense. No <a href="https://amzn.to/3d243Jp">expensive Yeti mic</a> or fancy studio setup is required to use Clubhouse. Everyone just has to use their phone. There is no significant differentiation in audio quality other than a quiet background.</p>



<h2>Instant Global Access to Live Talk Shows</h2>



<p>Clubhouse offers instant access to live conversations from friends, peers, experts, and thought leaders all around the world. It’s the new talk radio, only better since you’re not limited to the five AM radio frequencies you get in your own geography. And even better still, because you can also participate and ask questions too – also live and broadcast for all to hear. No radio station phone numbers to remember or menus to navigate. Just raise your hand and wait if you want to ask a question.</p>



<p>The social network audio model that Clubhouse has built feels like the future of talk radio. And I’m here for it. The market potential here is <em>huge</em>.</p>

At first, he says he wasn't sure what to do with them. Then, inspired by his guitar maker friend,&nbsp;the idea struck.</p>  <p>"It just popped into my head. I'm going to turn Uncle Fil into a guitar. And I was like, that is the best way to honour him. He would love that idea," he said.</p>  <p>Midnight says he has fond memories of listening to metal with his uncle, and seeing him perform at shows.</p>  <p>"Uncle Filip was a super metal head," he said. "He got me totally into metal when I was a little kid because he was my mother's younger brother, so he was closer to my age, and took me under his wing."</p>    <p>The idea didn't go over well with his mother at first, he said.&nbsp;</p>  <p>"When this first started happening, she was really upset. She said, 'It's sacrilegious. He needs to lie, you know, and rest,'" he said.</p>  <p>"And as she was walking away, I was like, 'You think Uncle Fil would rather be a guitar, or a box of bones?' She threw her arms up. She goes, 'Probably the guitar.'"</p>  <h2>'It's got some quirks'</h2>  <p>Making the guitar was no easy feat, either.</p>  <p>"No one's ever made a guitar out of a skeleton, to my surprise. So there is a little bit of a learning curve," he said.&nbsp;</p>  <p>"Originally, I was drilling into the vertebrae, the bones, and one cracked and broke. And so I was like, well, I've&nbsp;got to re-assess how I'm going to do this."</p>  <p>He ended up welding a metal bar onto the spine and attaching it to the bridge and neck of an old Fender Telecaster guitar. He also attached red and blue wires, reminiscent of veins and arteries depicted in medical books.</p>  <p><span><figure><div><p><img loading="lazy" alt="" srcset="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5909350.1612992577!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_300/skeleton-guitar.jpg 300w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5909350.1612992577!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_460/skeleton-guitar.jpg 460w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5909350.1612992577!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_620/skeleton-guitar.jpg 620w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5909350.1612992577!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/skeleton-guitar.jpg 780w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5909350.1612992577!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_1180/skeleton-guitar.jpg 1180w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 300px,(max-width: 460px) 460px,(max-width: 620px) 620px,(max-width: 780px) 780px,(max-width: 1180px) 1180px" src="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5909350.1612992577!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/skeleton-guitar.jpg"></p></div><figcaption>Turning a human skeleton into a guitar was no easy feat, says Midnight.<!-- --> <!-- -->(Submitted by Prince Midnight)</figcaption></figure></span></p>  <p>"It is not a typical guitar, so it's got some quirks, to say the least. But sometimes the limitations we have with our tools are what make&nbsp;the products great," he said.</p>  <p>"When you are trying to strum inside a rib cage, it limits how long your strokes with a pick could be, right? So that tends to make a heavier kind of tone when you're strumming. So, yeah, it has a certain sound to it, and I think it sounds great."</p>  <p>But most of all, he says it makes him feel close to his uncle again.</p>  <p>"I feel like Uncle Fil is not just here now figuratively; he's here literally too," he said. "I'm literally giving my Uncle Fil hugs while he's figuratively with me, creating, you know, heavy metal riffs."</p>  <hr>  <p><em>Written by Sheena Goodyear.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-id="8a920a5" data-element_type="widget" data-widget_type="theme-post-content.default"><div><h2 id="h-kubernetes-is-deprecating-docker">Kubernetes is Deprecating Docker?!</h2><p>For some time now, it seems that when people think of containers, they think of <a href="https://acloudguru.com/course/introduction-to-containers-and-docker">Docker</a> and <a href="https://acloudguru.com/course/kubernetes-deep-dive">Kubernetes</a>. Docker has been the big name when it comes to building and running containers, and Kubernetes has been the big name when it comes to managing and orchestrating them. It might seem a bit shocking to hear that Kubernetes is deprecating support for Docker as a container runtime starting with Kubernetes version 1.20.</p><p>So, I want to take this opportunity to talk about what this change really means, and what Kubernetes users will need to do about it.</p><figure><p> <iframe title="Kubernetes This Month: Container usage in production goes through the roof!" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/KzCaCBIgGvI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure><h2 id="h-what-s-changing">What’s Changing?</h2><p>Kubernetes deprecating Docker is actually not as big of a deal as it sounds, so let’s talk about what is really going on here.</p><p>Kubernetes is removing support for Docker as a <strong>container runtime</strong>. Kubernetes does not actually handle the process of running containers on a machine. Instead, it relies on another piece of software called a <strong>container runtime</strong>.</p><figure><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/ZdkIrgRa5Kx9RkYvsf_MitDSotGYiXP1dwpSE03SitQcSuHrk8VHKjGr5Mkdo8OXtoFsQpYv4UNaLw7xXLlbcYvvUDNyFM_Tcx2ussVCo7E9Z_aNj_NeN2AXJmLESV60PSp7hfVf" alt=""></figure><p>The container runtime runs containers on a host, and Kubernetes tells the container runtime on each host what to do. You can actually choose from a variety of options when it comes to what software you want to use as your container runtime when running Kubernetes. Up to now, a fairly popular option was to use Docker as the container runtime.</p><p>However, this will no longer be an option in the future. You will still be able to use Docker in other ways that are relevant to Kubernetes (more on that in a moment), but you will not be able to use Docker as the container runtime underneath Kubernetes.</p><h2 id="h-why-is-kubernetes-deprecating-docker">Why is Kubernetes Deprecating Docker?</h2><p>Kubernetes has supported using Docker a container runtime up to this point, so why are they choosing to stop supporting it?</p><p>Kubernetes works with all container runtimes that implement a standard known as the <strong>Container Runtime Interface (CRI)</strong>. This is essentially a standard way of communicating between Kubernetes and the container runtime, and any runtime that supports this standard automatically works with Kubernetes.</p><p>Docker does not implement the Container Runtime Interface (CRI). In the past, there weren’t as many good options for container runtimes, and Kubernetes implemented the Docker shim, an additional layer to serve as an interface between Kubernetes and Docker. Now, however, there are plenty of runtimes available that implement the CRI, and it no longer makes sense for Kubernetes to maintain special support for Docker.</p><h2 id="h-what-s-really-going-on">What’s Really Going On?</h2><p>To really understand why it makes sense for Kubernetes to deprecate Docker, we need to go a little deeper.</p><p>I’ll let you in on a secret: <strong>Docker is not actually a container runtime</strong>! It’s actually a collection of tools that sits on top of a container runtime called <strong>containerd</strong>.</p><p>That’s right! Docker does not run containers directly. It simply creates a more human-accessible and feature-rich interface on top of a separate, underlying container runtime. When it is used as a container runtime for Kubernetes, Docker is just a middle-man between Kubernetes and containerd.</p><figure><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/qAs7sRi19J_vdE9NYNyZ5MZp8rFoV4aNUmn4aGtrc4zJXsgA_Not2cG68ut6XAXxVFAiBDyK-zp7FO6-sdcFv2obvfIxBrkcsawBisG7IKirWP4ODOlwP0kz1V9vNn_TbXAhaGKz" alt=""></figure><p>However, Kubernetes can use containerd directly as a container runtime, meaning Docker is no longer needed in this middle-man role. Docker still has a lot to offer, even in a Kubernetes ecosystem. It’s just not needed specifically as a container runtime.</p><figure><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/cNGPBxKBF4_Vm_WvKM4QWqXGrX4LqgaJfUUxVycD3d5XPuyXS8aWH8zeEooL--2MSDUhKzOmwCdYPGo6Zpga0xIk3EzyNq2fyDbHc0akoGLbBfnymOODbDPHh2zAhHzvdvsFxUxS" alt=""></figure><h2 id="h-what-s-the-role-of-docker-going-forward">What’s the Role of Docker Going Forward?</h2><p>Although Docker is not needed as a container runtime in Kubernetes, it still has a role to play in the Kubernetes ecosystem, and in your workflow.</p><p>Docker is still going strong as a tool for developing and building container images, as well as running them locally. Kubernetes can still run containers built using Docker’s <strong>Open Container Initiative (OCI) </strong>image format, meaning you can still use Dockerfiles and build your container images using Docker.</p><p>Kubernetes will also continue to be able to pull from Docker registries (such as Docker hub). This means that Docker will remain a powerful contender when it comes to managing the images once they are built.</p><p>All in all, Docker will continue to be a useful tool on your development workflows and continuous integration (CI) systems, even if you don’t need it to run your containers underneath Kubernetes in production.</p><hr><p><em>Looking to get certified on K8s? Read our <a href="https://acloudguru.com/blog/engineering/which-kubernetes-certification-path-should-i-take">blueprint for the Kubernetes certification journey</a>. </em></p><hr><h2 id="h-what-should-i-do">What Should I Do?</h2><p>&nbsp;If you are currently using Docker as a container runtime in your Kubernetes environment, you will need to make some changes. Moving forward, you can simply eliminate Docker as a middle-man in your Kubernetes environment. Instead, use another container runtime, such as <a href="https://containerd.io/">containerd</a> or <a href="https://cri-o.io/">CRI-O</a>.</p><p>Before upgrading to a Kubernetes version removes support for Docker (which is currently estimated to release in late 2021), you will need to modify (or replace) existing Kubernetes nodes so that they use a supported container runtime other than Docker. Starting now, you may want to start building any new nodes so that they use a non-Docker container runtime as well.</p><p>Other than that, nothing is really changing. You can continue to use Docker to build your images, as well as to run containers locally for development purposes, or in your continuous integration (CI) stack. You can also continue to use Docker registries to store and manage your images.</p><p>If you are interested in learning how to use containerd alongside Kubernetes, check out my new course, <a href="https://acloud.guru/overview/introduction-to-kubernetes">Introduction to Kubernetes</a>. It includes lessons that will walk you through the process of installing containerd and using it in your Kubernetes cluster.</p></div></div></div>]]>

<p><b>Researchers at the RIKEN Center for Biosystems Dynamics Research in Japan have discovered a recipe for continuous cyclical regeneration of cultured hair follicles from hair follicle stem cells.</b></p>
<p>Scientists have been making waves in recent years by developing ways to grow a variety of useful items in laboratories, from meat and diamonds to retinas and other organoids. At the RIKEN Center for Biosystems Dynamics Research in Japan, a team led by Takashi Tsuji has been working on ways to regenerate lost hair from stem cells. In an important step, a new study identifies a critical population of hair follicle stem cells in the skin and a recipe for normal cyclical hair regeneration in the lab.</p>
<p>The researchers took fur and whisker cells from mice and cultured them in the laboratory with other biological “ingredients”. They used 220 combinations of ingredients, and found that combining a type of collagen with five factors — the NFFSE medium — led to the highest rate of stem cell amplification in the shortest period of time.</p>
<p>Hair growth in mammals is a continuous cyclical process in which hair grows, falls out, and is grown again. Growth occurs in the anagen phase and hair falls out in the telogen phase. Thus, a successful hair-regeneration treatment must produce hair that recycles. To test whether stem cells cultured in the NFFSE medium produce hair that cycles, the researchers placed bioengineered hair follicle stem cells in NFFSE medium or in medium missing one of the ingredients and observed the regenerated hair for several weeks. They found 81% of hair follicles generated in NFFSE medium went through at least three hair cycles and produced normal hair. In contrast, 79% of follicles grown in the other medium produced only one hair cycle.</p>
<p>Knowing that stem-cell renewal can depend on what is attached to the outside of the cells, the researchers next looked for markers on the surface of cells cultured in the NFFSE medium. In addition to the expected CD34 and CD49f markers, they found the best hair cycling was related to the addition of Itgβ5. “We found almost 80% of follicles reached three hair cycles when Itgβ5 was also bioengineered into the hair follicle germ,” explains first author Makoto Takeo. “In contrast, only 13% reached three cycles when it was not present.” Analysis showed that these important cells are naturally located in the upper part of the hair follicle’s bulge region.</p>
<p>“Our culture system establishes a method for cyclical regeneration of hair follicles from hair follicle stem cells,” says Tsuji, “and will help make hair follicle regeneration therapy a reality in the near future.” As preclinical animal-safety tests using these cultured cells were completed in 2019, the next step in the process is clinical trials.</p>
<p>“RIKEN is primarily an institute that does basic research,” explains Tsuji. “And clinical trials usually require outside collaborators. We are therefore looking for a partner company to help develop the clinical applications and welcome donations to promote the R&amp;D.”</p>

While technically correct, I believe these attributes tend to overlook other surprising properties.</p><p>In this article, I invite readers to learn more about its internal features, many of which became predominant in the market only after the Virtual Boy’s discontinuation.</p><hr><h2 id="display">Display</h2><p>The whole system is a curious piece of engineering. Externally, it resembles a bulky VR headset on a bipod. The player must place their head close to the eyepiece to see the game in action.</p><div><a href="https://www.copetti.org/images/consoles/virtualboy/case/front.f5ed2bf56afcaf7238bb81e26e42ea66a11e68a40b14581affc282e9ee25c268.png"><picture>

In reality, games look very crisp and in full size!</figcaption></div><p>Internally, it’s a whole different story (and a very complicated one too). For this reason, I thought it would be better to start by explaining how this console displays images and then go through the internal hardware.</p><h4 id="projecting-an-image">Projecting an image</h4><p>Once you switch the Virtual Boy on, you will start seeing two <strong>monochromatic red</strong> pictures (one for each eye) through the eyepiece. So far so good? Well, here is the interesting part: <strong>This console doesn’t have a screen</strong>, so what you see is more of an ‘illusion’ - Let’s dive deeper to know what’s going on.</p><p>The topics involved in explaining this (optics, visual phenomenons, etc) may feel difficult at first, but I constructed some interactive animations to make this section little more immersive.</p><div><ul><li id="tab-2-1-scanner-link"><a href="#tab-2-1-scanner">Scanner</a></li><li id="tab-2-2-mechanics-link"><a href="#tab-2-2-mechanics">Mechanics</a></li><li id="tab-2-3-display-link"><a href="#tab-2-3-display">Display</a></li><li id="tab-2-4-active-periods-link"><a href="#tab-2-4-active-periods">Active periods</a></li></ul><div><div id="tab-2-1-scanner"><h4>Scanner</h4><p>The large volume of this console can be attributed to the <strong>Scanner</strong>, which fills up a big part of it. The Scanner is the area of the Virtual Boy that displays images. It’s composed of two <strong>Display units</strong>, each one independently projects a frame (giving a total of two frames, one per eye).</p><p>A Display unit is where all the ‘magic’ happens, it’s made of the following components:</p><ul><li>An <strong>LED Unit</strong>: Contains 224 red LEDs stacked vertically and the necessary circuitry to control each one of them.</li><li>A <strong>Lens</strong>: Refracts the light coming from the LEDs.<ul><li>At the top of the Virtual Boy’s case, there is a <strong>Focus slider</strong> used to shift the lenses closer or further away from the LEDs. This allows the user to adapt the console to their focal length (preventing blurry images).</li></ul></li><li>A <strong>Mirror</strong>: Reflects the light coming from the lens and directs them to the user’s eyes. Furthermore, this component will be constantly oscillating thanks to a <strong>Voice coil motor</strong> connected to it. The motor is managed by the <strong>Servo control</strong>, a separate board which sends electrical pulses at 50 Hz.<ul><li>All in all, this is a very complex and fragile area of the console, so there’s a photo interrupter (a type of photosensor) installed. This reports the oscillation observed from the mirror to the Servo control, which in turns monitors the oscillations and applies the necessary corrections.</li></ul></li></ul><p>Next to the focus slider there is a <strong>IPD dial</strong> (knob-shaped switch), which adjust the distance between the two Display units. This is done to adapt the displays to the user’s inter-pupil distance.</p></div><div id="tab-2-2-mechanics"><h4>Mechanics</h4><div><figcaption>Basic representation of the angle of the oscillating mirror over time (at a very slow motion)<br>The left and right LEDs are operating (active) during the red and blue period, respectively<br>During the grey period, no LED is operating (idle)<br>For sake of simplicity, the angular velocity represented here is constant (but not in the real world)</figcaption></div><p>Now that we have each component identified, let’s take a look how the Virtual Boy manages to show images to our eyes.</p><p>If you haven’t noticed before, there <strong>isn’t any dot-matrix display to be found</strong>, so why are we seeing two-dimensional images from the eyepiece? Similarly to the functioning of a CRT monitor, Display units play with the way we perceive images:</p><ul><li>The fact the mirrors oscillate enables a single column of LEDs to displace horizontally between our field of view. The angle of the mirror is strategically directed to place the LEDs on 384 different ‘column positions’ distributed across our field of view.</li><li>Human vision is logarithmic and the mirror oscillates at <strong>50 Hz</strong> (each period takes 20 ms). This is so fast we end up perceiving 384 columns of LEDs illuminating at the same time (afterimage effect) until the mirror stops oscillating.</li><li>All of this is perfectly synchronised with the LED controller, which updates each LED bulb every time the mirror is slightly moved. Thus, we end up seeing a full picture coming from the eyepiece.</li></ul><p>In practice, there are some conditions for all these principles to work:</p><ul><li>The LEDs must only operate when the angular velocity of the mirror is stable (in other words, not when the mirror is changing direction). This can be thought of as the <a href="https://www.copetti.org/writings/consoles/master-system/#tab-2-4-result"><strong>Active State</strong></a> of a CRT monitor.</li><li>In relation to the previous point, the angular velocity of the mirror can’t stay constant (since the mirror can’t change direction instantly, the periods considered ‘stable’ will be subject to forces that will disrupt its velocity). To remedy this, the Virtual Boy stores a list of values in memory called <strong>Column Table</strong> which instructs how much time to dedicate for each column interval, in an effort to balance out excessive &amp; insufficient periods of ‘LED column’ exposure.</li><li>Let’s not forget that this whole process has to be done twice since we got two display units (one per eye). Unfortunately, both units can’t pull energy and data at the same time, so each one operates at different display periods (out-of-phase, 10ms apart). We don’t notice this (another illusion!).</li></ul></div><div id="tab-2-3-display"><h4>Display</h4><div><figcaption>Simplified representation of how the first LED unit operates during specific periods of time. Notice how the LEDs will start displaying each column of the frame-buffer during active periods.</figcaption></div><p>Contrary to previous video chips modelled after CRT displays (i.e. <a href="https://www.copetti.org/writings/consoles/nes/#graphics">PPU</a> and <a href="https://www.copetti.org/writings/consoles/master-system/#graphics">VGP</a>), graphics on the Virtual Boy are <strong>not rendered on-the-fly</strong>. The graphics chip on this console sends the processed frame to a frame-buffer in memory, each column of the frame is then sent to the LED array for display.</p><p>Once the Servo board detects it’s time for display, the graphics chip will start sending columns of pixels from the frame-buffer to those 224 vertically-stacked LEDs, one-by-one in a strategically synchronised matter so the LEDs will have shown 384 columns during the display period. Hence, the ‘screen resolution’ of this console is 384x224 pixels.</p><p>Moreover, we need to store two frame-buffers since each one will go to a different display unit. The graphics subsystem also employs double-buffering and other quirks (mentioned later in the ‘Graphics’ section). So, for now, just remember how a digital frame is sent to the LEDs.</p></div><div id="tab-2-4-active-periods"><h4>Active periods</h4><div><figcaption>Another simplified animation, this time showing how the oscillation of the mirror deviates the LEDs light in a way the user will end up seeing a proper frame</figcaption></div><p>Consequently of this design, there are going to be periods of:</p><ul><li><strong>Active Display</strong> during which the LEDs are pulling an image from the frame-buffer and nothing can disrupt it.</li><li><strong>Active Display 2</strong>: Same as before but now the other Display unit is operating.</li><li><strong>Drawing idle</strong>: A period where none of the LEDs are operating and the angular velocity of the mirror is unstable.</li></ul><p>This cycle is repeated 50 times per second (hence the 50 Hz refresh rate). That means that for every frame, the CPU and GPU would have around 10ms worth of time to update the picture that the user will see. In reality, Nintendo’s engineers implemented something more sophisticated. Again, I’ll try to explain this with more depth in the ‘Graphics’ section. But for now I hoped you got a good understanding of how the Virtual Boy cleverly managed to produce a picture with inexpensive hardware.</p></div></div></div><p>This has been a quick explanation of how optics can turn a single vertical line into a picture. If you own or have read about the Virtual Boy before, you may be wondering when the three-dimensional imagery takes place. I just want to make it clear that none of the previous explanation have a connection with that effect. I’m mentioning this because in the past I’ve seen many places arguing that the oscillating mirrors are the cause of the ‘depth perception’, however, with all the information I’ve gathered in this study, I don’t think that claim is accurate.</p><p>That being said, I think it’s time we discuss the 3D phenomenon…</p><h4 id="creating-a-third-dimensional-vision">Creating a third-dimensional vision</h4><p>During the marketing of the Virtual Boy, there was a lot of fanfare regarding the fact this console could project a ‘3D world’. I’m not referring to images with 3D polygons stamped (like the other 5th gen. consoles), but the actual perception of depth.</p><p>In a nutshell, the Virtual Boy relies on <strong>Stereoscopic images</strong> to carry out that illusion. So this system wasn’t only capable of toying with our vision to project a full image, but it also did it in a way we would think certain drawings are closer/far away from others!</p><div><div><figcaption>Snapshot of the game seen from the different display units<br>Mario's Tennis (1995)</figcaption></div><p>The technique is very simple: Each of the two frames displayed (one on each eye) will have some elements slightly shifted horizontally, so when we try to see them with our two eyes, our brain will think they are nearer than others. This depends on the direction the elements are shifted.</p><p>Objects shifted towards the centre of your eyes (moved right on the left frame and moved left on the right frame) will appear closer, objects shifted away from the center of your eyes will appear further away. Finally, objects with no shifting will appear between the two other. This approach is called <strong>Stereoscopic parallax</strong>.</p></div><p>One of the drawbacks of stereoscopy is <strong>eyestrain</strong>. This was alleviated by the fact games provided an ‘automatic pause’ system which reminded the user to take breaks every 30 min. Nintendo also wrote down various warning messages in their packaging and …</p></div></div></div>

	<p>
Being a practicing programmer, you are very unlikely to implement yet another linear system solving algorithm all by yourself. This guide doesn't cover the implementation details of such, therefore. Although, you will probably face the problems that may be solved in a form of linear systems, and often more elegantly than by any other means. This tutorial is all about the concepts that should help you recognize these problems and find the best solution for them.
	</p>
	<p>
But even if you are not interested in linear algebra at all, you might still find this tutorial interesting. Things as convergence, computational error, algorithmic complexity, — are all easy to show on a task as intuitive and graphic as solving a simple linear system.
	</p>
	<p>
A <span id="index_linear_system">linear system</span> is a system of linear equations. A linear equation is a sum of weighted variables that equals a constant. In two-dimensional space, it is also an equation for an actual line. In 3 dimensions it's a plane, in 4 — a hyperplane, and so on.
	</p>
	<p>
The system may be represented as an array of equations.
	</p>
	<table>
	<tbody><tr>
	<td rowspan="2">{</td>
	<td id="system_1_system_row1">
	a11x1 + a12x2 = b1
	</td>
	</tr><tr>
	<td id="system_1_system_row2">
	a21x1 + a22x2 = b2
	</td>
	</tr>
	</tbody></table>
	<p>
The very same array of equations constitutes a <span id="index_matrix_equation">matrix equation</span>.
	</p>

	<table>
	<tbody><tr>
	<td>[</td>
	<td id="system_1_matrix_col1">
1<br>0
	</td>
	<td id="system_1_matrix_col2">
0<br>1
	</td>
	<td>]</td>
	<td>[</td>
	<td>
x<sub>1</sub> <br> x<sub>2</sub>
	</td>
	<td>]</td>
	<td> = </td>
	<td>[</td>
	<td id="system_1_matrix_col3">
0<br>1
	</td>
	<td>]</td>
	</tr>
	</tbody></table>

	<p>
And in the simplest case, it may also have a <span id="index_graphic_form">graphic form</span>.
	</p>
	<canvas id="system_1" width="640" height="512"></canvas>
	
	

	<p>
The graphic form is a useful mental model because it makes the system visual. Its solution is merely an intersection of lines.
	</p>

	<form>
		<b>Quest 1.</b> Using the plot above, please make a system that has a solution <nobr>in <i>x<sub>1</sub> = 0, x<sub>2</sub> = 0</i>.</nobr> It doesn't have to be exact, it would be cumbersome to achieve that on a small plot. Just make it somewhere near <i>(0, 0)</i>. Then press the “Check!” button.
		
		
	</form>

	<p>
But even a well-specified system may lack a solution (an intersection).
	</p>

	<form>
		<b>Quest 2.</b> Using the same plot above, please make a system with no solution.
		
		
	</form>

	<p>
And sometimes it may have not a single, but an infinite number of solutions.
	</p>

	<form>
		<b>Quest 3.</b> Using the same plot above, please make a system with infinite solutions.
		
		
	</form>

	<p>
This may be a problem for numeric methods aimed to find a single solution. They may report an error or, even worse, supply you with the first-best solution they find. In this case, you should check your equations for <span id="index_linear_dependency">linear dependency</span>.
	</p>
	<p>
You see when you multiply every coefficient of an equation, and the constant, to the same number, all the facts about the points it describes remain intact. It's still the same equation; it's still the same line.
	</p>
	<table>
	<tbody><tr>
	<td id="linear_row1">
	x<sub>1</sub> + 2x<sub>2</sub> = 3
	</td>
	</tr><tr>
	<td>
	
	</td>
	</tr><tr>
	<td id="linear_row2">
	2x<sub>1</sub> + 4x<sub>2</sub> = 6
	</td>
	</tr>
	</tbody></table>

	<p>
Sometimes, systems have more equations than variables. These systems are called <b><span id="index_overspecified">overspecified</span></b>.
	</p>
	<canvas id="system_2" width="640" height="512"></canvas>
	
	<p>
In the general case, these systems don't have a solution, but in some rare cases, they do.
	</p>

	<form>
		<b>Quest 4.</b> Using the 3-lines plot, please make a system with a single solution.
		
		
	</form>

	<p>
Sometimes, systems have more variables than equations. These systems are called <b><span id="index_underspecified">underspecified</span></b>.
	</p>
	<p>
Of course, in a 2-dimensional case, they only have one equation, and an infinite number of solutions. Every point that lies on the equation's line is a solution. But in more-dimensional cases, underspecified systems might not have any solutions at all.
	</p>

	 

	<p>
There are two major classes of linear system solvers: iterative and direct.
	</p>
	<p>
Iterative algorithms are very simple conceptually. They all can be boiled down to these three steps
	</p>
	<ol>
	<li>Start somewhere.</li>
	<li>See if you got what you were looking for. <br>If so — great, you are done!</li>
	<li>If not, do something that brings you closer to the goal. <br>Go to step 2.</li>
	</ol>
	<p>
Let's make a linear solver out of that. The part of the algorithm that will bring us closer to the solution will be a simple projection. If you project an arbitrary point on a line, the projection will be closer to ane point of that line, including of course the desired solution. Therefore, by projecting a point from one line to another we will get closer and closer to the solution.
	</p>
	<p>
If, of course, there is one.
	</p>
	<p>
As for exit criteria, we can simply measure how far we have to travel to make an iteration — a projective “leap” from one line to another. Presumably, as we're getting closer, the leap distance should shorten, so at some point, we might consider it small enough to stop the operation.
	</p>
	<p>
And we can leave the question “where to start” unanswered. Of course, it would be fantastic to start right at the solution point, but generally, our algorithm should work for any starting point we choose.
	</p>
	<p>
Here is the interactive illustration of it.
	</p>
	<p>
		Change: &nbsp;
		<label for="button_1">lines</label> &nbsp;
		<label for="button_2">start point</label> &nbsp;
		<label for="button_3">stop distance</label>
	</p>
	<canvas id="solver_1" width="640" height="512"></canvas>
	

	

	<p>
When an algorithm just like this gets closer to the solution with every iteration, it is said it converges. When it gets further from the point, it diverges. <b>Convergence</b> is the second most important property of the iterative algorithm. It is basically its speed.
	</p>
	<p>
And the first most important property of an algorithm is its <b><span id="index_stability">stability</span></b>. Usually, the more mathematical operations you do, the more error you gather. But stable algorithms have the property of reducing the error automatically. It gathers some error on every iteration, sure, but it doesn't accumulate it into anything ugly.
	</p>
	<p>
This particular algorithm is stable and geometrically incapable of divergence. Moreover, its convergence is directly linked to the angle between the lines.
	</p>
	<form>
		<b>Quest 6.</b> Using the plot from above, please make a system and set up the conditions to solve it in exactly 58 iterations.
		
		
	</form>
	<p>
Unfortunately, stability and convergence alone don't make it any good in practice. It is vulnerable to the near-parallel corner case and the choice of the exit condition.
	</p>
	<form>
		<b>Quest 7.</b> Using the plot from above, please make a system and set up the conditions so the solution will have an error of over 6.0.
		
		
	</form>
	<p>
Unlike iterative, <span id="index_direct_algorithm">direct algorithm</span>s don't have convergence. They always get the job done in some determined number of operations. In some conditions, however, iterative algorithms may behave just like direct.
	</p>
	<form>
		<b>Quest 8.</b> Using the plot from above, please make a system that is always solvable in no more than 3 iterations.
		
		
	</form>
	<p>
Being able to always solve a system in just a few leaps is neat. It's like the ultimate convergence — a metaphorical speed of light in computations. Fortunately, we can turn our iterative solver into direct by adding one small detail.
	</p>
	<p>
Previously we did every leap by doing an orthogonal projection to a respective line. But what if we do the projection parallel to the respective line?
	</p>
	<canvas id="solver_2" width="640" height="512"></canvas>
	
	<p>
Since the algorithm is now direct, it doesn't need exit criteria. Also, since it has “an ultimate convergence” starting point selection doesn't matter. That's brilliant! Why do we need iterative algorithms at all?
	</p>
	<p>
There is, of course, a catch. When the iterative algorithm's speed depends on convergence, the direct algorithm's speed depends on its complexity. This particular algorithm is rather complex.
	</p>
	<p>
<b><span id="index_algorithm_complexity">Algorithm complexity</span></b> itself is not a quantity. It's not just a constant number of operations to get things done. Just like with convergence, this number depends on things. In our case, it depends on the number of equations. This makes it a function, and we usually use big-O notation to characterize it. Big-O sets the form of a limiting function — a function our complexity has no right to overtake for any number of equations.
	</p>
	<p>
If you have something simple, like a single for loop, its complexity is linear: <i>O(n)</i>. If you have a loop inside a loop, then it's <i>O(n<sup>2</sup>)</i>. This kind of complexity is called <b>polynomial</b>, and it's quite common in the wild. For instance, our projective solver has <span id="index_polynomial_complexity">polynomial complexity</span>.
	</p>
	<div>
	<pre>def cross_of(A):
  ''' n-dimensional cross product on (n-1) vectors in list A '''
  D = len(A[0])
  N = len(A)

  v_res = [0.] * D
  <b>for</b> i in xrange(0, D):
    <b>for</b> jk in xrange(0, D ** N):
      v_ijk = [i] + [(jk/(D ** (N-j-1))) % D <b>for</b> j in xrange(0, N)]
      t_res = v__E(v_ijk)
      if t_res != 0:
        <b>for</b> k in xrange(0, N):
          t_res *= A[k][v_ijk[k + 1]]
        v_res[i] += t_res
  return v_res


def solution_for(A, B):
  p = [0. for each in B]
  <b>for</b> i in xrange(len(A)):
    plane_n = A[i]
    plane_d = -B[i]
    other_planes_ns = A[:i] + A[i+1:]
    projection_vector = cross_of(other_planes_ns)
    p = project_by_vector(p, projection_vector, plane_n, plane_d)
  return p
	</pre>
	</div>

	
	<p>
You might imagine that with polynomial complexity using a direct algorithm on massive systems is not really plausible. Solving a 1000 equation system with our algorithm requires a trillion operations. In this regard, iterative algorithms are the worthy alternative. Not that they are generally faster, but it's all about balancing between convergence and complexity.
	</p>
	<p>
Our algorithm may be graphic, but it is too heavy to be considered practically useful. There are better options out there. For instance, <span id="index_gaussian_elimination">Gaussian elimination</span> has a complexity of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaussian_elimination#Computational_efficiency"><i>O(n<sup>3</sup>)</i></a>, and the theoretical best for <span id="index_lu_decomposition">LU decomposition</span> is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LU_decomposition#Theoretical_complexity"><i>O(n<sup>2.376</sup>)</i></a>.
	</p>
	<p>
They both share the same idea: we can change the system however we want until it holds true. We already saw that we can equally multiply both ends of an equation and still retain the same line in the graphic form. We can also add pick any equation and sum it with any other equation from the same system. This will change the line but retain the solution.
	</p>
	<p>
By doing these operations alone we can turn almost any system into the trivial one.

P. S.

	<p>
That's all fine, but how do you choose a method to solve your particular case? Here are a few hints.
	</p>
	<ol>
	<li>
If your system is sparse, meaning most of the coefficients are zeroes, you can exploit this with any <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LU_decomposition">decomposition</a> (factorization) or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_of_linear_equations#Elimination_of_variables">elimination</a> based method that works on sparse structures.
	</li>
	<li>
If your matrix is diagonally dominant, meaning that the largest elements in every equation tend to land on the diagonal, then iterative methods such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacobi_method">Jacobi</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gauss%E2%80%93Seidel_method">Gauss-Seidel</a> should work best for you.

And if your system is very small, like 2 …</li></ol></div></div>

<p>This is the continuation of the second part of a three part (<a href="https://acoup.blog/2021/01/29/collections-the-universal-warrior-part-i-soldiers-warriors-and/">I</a>, <a href="https://acoup.blog/2021/02/05/collections-the-universal-warrior-part-iia-the-many-faces-of-battle/">IIa</a>, III) discussion of the notion that there is a ‘universal warrior’ – a transcendent sameness about either the experience of war or ‘warrior values’ which might provide some sort of useful blueprint for life generally or some sort of fundamental truth about the experience of war.</p>



<p><a href="https://acoup.blog/2021/02/05/collections-the-universal-warrior-part-iia-the-many-faces-of-battle/">We started this section last week </a>by looking at the forms of war along with the direct emotional experience of combat.  What we found is that, quite to the contrary of there being just one sort of war that ‘never changes,’ there are in fact multiple <em>systems</em> of war that function quite differently (with considerable variation both within and between those systems) to the point that armies often find opponents working from within a different system of war almost utterly alien to them.</p>



<p>Moreover, as we discussed, the experience of battle, not merely the technology, tactics and circumstances, but the <em>raw emotional experience</em> (taken in terms of courage and fear) wasn’t constant either.  Different cultures understood ‘courage’ differently (and we must remember that translation here can be deceiving – most of them didn’t understand ‘courage’ at all, they understood <em>andreia</em> or <em>fortis </em>or <em>corage</em> or <em>der Mut</em> or <em>woohitike</em> which are, in the end, subtly different things and so not quite ever exactly courage at all) and different battles imposed different sorts of fear which strained those combatants in different ways.</p>



<p>Now we’re going to keep soldiering on and look at some of the other factors of the war experience: the importance of comrades, the drudgery and toil of war, and of course wounds (both physical and mental) and their healing.  Once again, to abuse the opening lines of the <em>Fallout</em> series, we going to ask if it is really true that “War, war never changes.”</p>

<h2>The Ties that Bind</h2>



<p>What about the personal relationships that are formed in the context of conflict?  Surely, the ‘band of brothers’ is a truly universal experience, right (<a href="https://youtu.be/76_Q9ruJfrE">but note on the complexities of Shakespeare’s <em>Henry V</em></a>)?  Surely the social bonds that held<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Band_of_Brothers_(miniseries)"> Easy-Company</a> together in 1944 and 1945 are the same as those from 1415?  Or 415?</p>



<p>Well, no.  Not quite.</p>



<p>We can approach this question through the idea of cohesion – the moral force that holds a group of combatants together on the battlefield under the intense emotional stresses of combat.  The intense bonds that soldiers form in modern armies (particularly those in the European pattern) are not an accident, but a core part of how those armies, institutionally, seek to build cohesion.  Going back to last week, we discussed briefly the emergence of the extensively drilled and disciplined ‘mechanical’ soldier of Early Modern Europe, noting that this approach wasn’t necessary for the effective use of firearms (the Ottoman Janissaries, for instance, were quite good with firearms, but were not trained and organized in this way), but rather was a product of elite aristocratic (read: officer) disdain for their up-jumped peasant soldiers and thus the assumption by those aristocrats that the only way to get such men to fight effectively was to relentlessly drill them.</p>

<p>Now the funny thing about this system is that it clearly <em>worked</em>, but not for the reasons its aristocratic pioneers believed.  It was only really after the Second World War that systematic study began to be made of unit cohesion (e.g. S.L.A. Marshall, <em>Men Against Fire</em> (1947), though subsequent literature on the topic is voluminous and Marshal’s work has its problems, but its conclusions are broadly accepted having been confirmed in subsequent studies).  What emerged quite clearly was that it wasn’t ‘the cause’ or patriotism that held troops together under fire, but group cohesion born out of an intense need not to let fellow soldiers in the unit down.  In short, what held units together and made them fight more effectively was (in part, there are many conclusions in <em>Men Against Fire</em>) the strong social bonds between comrades.</p>



<p>And, in fact, the drill and discipline of early modern European armies unintentionally did quite a lot of cohesion building things.  Soldiers were removed from civilian society (isolation from larger groups builds unit cohesion), split into very small groups (keeping the core group that coheres below <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunbar%27s_number">Dunbar’s number</a> aids in group cohesion; thus <a href="https://youtu.be/a15gihWu1SM">why the platoon is a natural unit size</a>) and then pushed through difficult and unpleasant training (that drill and discipline) creating a sense of unique shared experience and sacrifice.  All of which doesn’t render men <em>machines</em>, but it does create strong social bonds within the units that will keep the men fighting even when they care little for their cause (which they generally did in this period; one does not find a super-abundance of patriotism among, say, the Army of Flanders).</p>



<p>And there is a tendency to point to this cohesion, its modern source in ‘toughening’ boot camp and to say, ‘aha!  That is the true universal about effective soldier-warriors!’  Except – and you knew there was going to be an except – except it isn’t.  Systems built on the use of drill and discipline for the development of unit cohesion through social bonds are actually, historically speaking, quite rare.  We see systems like that in use by the Romans from the Middle Republic forward (but significantly faded by the end of late antiquity; the Byzantine army doesn’t seem to function this way), in China from the Han Dynasty onward, in Japan for the <em>ashigaru</em> infantry from the Sengoku period, and in Europe from the Early Modern period.  That <em>sounds</em> like a lot, but that is relatively small minority of the historical period and even then in a relatively small minority of places.  It is, for instance, a period that only covers about half of the historical period in Western Europe, the place most often associated with this very system of organization (though that association is perhaps unfair to East Asia).</p>



<p>Instead, most societies relied on existing social bonds formed <em>outside</em> of the experience of war for cohesion.  Greek hoplite armies, for instance, generally formed up by <em>polis</em> (read: city) and then within those blocks by still smaller and smaller social divisions, so that family and neighbors would be standing shoulder to shoulder in the battle line (Sparta does this through the system of communal messes, the <em>syssitia</em>, but the idea that you fought alongside the men you dined with socially – your neighbors, generally – was perfectly normal in most Greek cities).  That was intentional – it allowed the phalanx to cohere through the social pressure not to be seen as a coward before the men who meant the most to you, whose shaming gaze you would have to endure in civilian life.  The same pressures, by the well, held together the (mostly volunteer) armies of the American Civil War (on this, see, McPherson, <em>For Cause and Comrades</em> (1997)).</p>



<p>By contrast, ‘warrior’ classes often rely on a sort of class solidarity along with the demand of an individual military aristocrat to be <em>individually</em> militarily excellent.  Richard Kaeuper quips of the literature of the medieval knightly class that it was filled with “utterly tireless, almost obsessional emphasis placed on personal prowess” (R.W. Kaeuper, <em>Chivalry and Violence in Medieval Europe</em> (1999)).  We’ve talked a fair bit about the values of mounted aristocrats, both in <a href="https://acoup.blog/2020/04/16/collections-a-trip-through-bertran-de-born-martial-values-in-the-12th-century-occitan-nobility/">their </a><a href="https://acoup.blog/2020/04/10/collections-antarah-ibn-shaddad-victory-songs/">role </a>as combatants and <a href="https://acoup.blog/2020/06/12/collections-the-battle-of-helms-deep-part-vii-hanging-by-a-thread/">in their roles as generals </a>and those values are relatively disconnected from discipline-induced forms of buddy-cohesion.  Of course exactly what ‘good generalship’ or ‘good officership’ looks like varies wildly from place to place – Alexander was expected to command his cavalry from the front; Roman emperors rarely took the battlefield and when they did they commanded from the rear since it would be foolish to risk the ‘brain’ of the army in personal combat and in any event someone at the front of a cavalry charge can hardly direct the rest of the army.</p>



<p>One of the things I find most striking about the ‘warrior ethos’ advanced by writers like Pressfield is that it accepts as normal the unique nature of the bonds that hold soldiers together in battle, assuming this bond and its shared sacrifice to be at once unique to combat and also transcendent to all combatants.  But one of the key points made very well in Sebastian Junger’s <em>War </em>(2010) and later <em>Tribe</em> (2016) is just how <em><strong>strange</strong></em> that experience is, historically.  <strong>Junger notes that in earlier societies, soldiers would have returned from war into communities </strong>(often small, agricultural communities or tribal communities) <strong>every bit as close-knit as the infantry platoon – and indeed, often involving <em>literally the same people</em> as the infantry platoon</strong>.  Instead, the intense feeling of uniqueness that modern soldiers feel about the bonds of combat is because of the historically unusual deracination produced by modern societies by the industrial revolution and the post-industrial period.</p>



<p>And Junger’s point is born out quite clearly when looking at the myriad of historical societies where those non-combat social bonds were the basis of the principles of military cohesion, be it the small-town cohesion of the hoplite phalanx or the class-based-expectation cohesion of a group of knights, or (for that matter) later modern …</p></div></div>

		<p><img src="https://20stech.com/files/arm-pr-image-210211b-thm.jpg">During its third fiscal quarter of 2020, Arm and its silicon partners shipped a record 6.7 billion Arm-based chips, resulting in a total of more than 180 billion Arm chips having now shipped.<br>
<span id="more-671"></span><br>
Arm claims to be the leading processor architecture for IoT and embedded devices, having shipped a record 4.4 billion Arm Cortex-M based chips in the quarter, and the company also said the Arm Mali graphics processors remain the number one shipping GPU. Rene Haas, President, Arm IP Products Group, said the company’s ecosystem continues to grow, with Arm partners signing a record 175 new licenses during CY2020, bringing the total to 1,910 licenses and 530 licensees.<br>

Arm plans to move most of its design work to Arm-based cloud services over the next several years, according to a <a href="https://www.arm.com/company/news/2020/12/arm-moves-production-level-electronic-design-automation-to-the-cloud-with-the-help-of-aws">mid-December news release</a>. The company intends to share its experiences, in an effort to encourage partners to design their Arm-based silicon on Arm-based cloud services. </p>
<p>For Arm, the advantage of the cloud is the ability to scale its computing power and storage faster and less expensively than by deploying servers and software for internal use by projects. Additionally, migrating services to the cloud gives its engineers more flexibility and freedom to sort out problems with its chips, and determine chip fit for an application or use care prior to a costly production run. </p>
<p>Since beginning its AWS cloud migration, the company has realized a six-fold improvement in performance time for EDA workflows on AWS, <a href="https://press.aboutamazon.com/news-releases/news-release-details/aws-and-arm-demonstrate-production-scale-electronic-design">according to an Amazon news release</a>. Also, by running telemetry (the collection and integration of data from remote sources) and analysis on AWS, Arm is able to generate more powerful engineering, business, and operational insights that help increase workflow efficiency and optimize costs and resources across the company. On top of these benefits, Arm expects to reduce its global datacenter footprint by at least 45% and its on-premises compute by 80% as it completes its migration to AWS.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>It was yet another gloomy evening in the Beamopolis. Boxes hiding artifacts of solved and unsolved cases cluttered my room. Dim light passing through my small window covers everything. I was sitting in front of my desk and was oscillating between the dream world and reality. A brutal phone call woke me up, and my intuition kicked in, telling me this will not be another typical case of a messy exception that went wrong.</p>

<p>I was right; this time, my caller was asking impossible. She wanted me to find a way to trace a suspect. Still, not only that, but the requirement was also to see all the breadcrumbs left by a suspect. She also demanded to gather all information about suspect inputs and outputs – all that with a possibility to have insights on-demand, remotely without even meeting me in person. My initial gut feeling told me to hang up the phone right away, but as always, with those cases, there is an urge to stand up to the challenge and try to accomplish the impossible.</p>

<p>For better or worse, I've agreed. Now I was standing next to my window, looking at all those actors passing by, not aware of each other minds but beautifully arranged in asynchronous dance on message lanes. I had to find a way to trace my suspect in the worst part of Beamopolis – Complexity District 9. The story tells that no one knows what happens behind the defmodule lines separating the district from the rest of the city – yet everyone communicates with them daily. I was skimming through my options.</p>

<p>A <a href="https://hexdocs.pm/tracer/readme.html" rel="nofollow">Tracer</a> Trevor owns me a favor from our last case, but he was not ideal for the task at hand. It was hard to make him not put all his information to standard output but rather send it to me via a message. I also thought about the famous hacker going with the nickname <a href="https://github.com/fishcakez/dbg" rel="nofollow">dbg</a>, but she was quite rusty and might not have been able to address all my requirements. Then I've had an a-ha moment; there is already an excellent tracer in the city – <a href="https://github.com/massemanet/redbug" rel="nofollow">redbug</a>. He does not speak elixirish; instead, he is fluent in erlangish – if there only be a way to find a decent translator. After a few phone calls, I was lucky enough to find a fine young lady – <a href="https://github.com/nietaki/rexbug" rel="nofollow">rexbug</a>, who agreed to help me out and translate what redbug was saying to the language I speak.</p>

<p>Unfortunately for me, redbug had a similar limitation (at first glance only as I was going to find out) that it was outputting his findings to the standard output of his. The approach would not work for me as my mysterious caller demanded to have a possibility to query traces 24/7. That meant I have to build a specific endpoint for her, and tracing my suspect should be automated.</p>

<p>After going back and forth with rexbug, we've found a way. She told me that I could use a custom function to print whatever redbug found to wherever I want to. I knew that was it. At this stage, I knew I would be able to finish what I've started. I've come up with the following invocation.</p>

<pre><code>TraceClient.start(
  [
    "Main.Suspect :: return"
  ],
  time: @timeout,
  msgs: @max_number_of_messages,
  print_fun: fn entry -&gt; GenServer.call(Tracer, {:trace_entry, entry}) end
)
</code></pre>

<p>Both <code>@timeout</code> and <code>@max_number_of_messages</code> were set up in agreement with rexbug that we won't try to trace my suspect for too long (or too short), and if he becomes too noisy, we would also cease the operation. After all, we do not want to go too deep inside the Complexity District 9.</p>

<p>With my invocation ready, I could do my tedious but so needed work to handle all the pieces of evidence and present them to my employer. I came up with the following.</p>

<pre><code>defmodule Tracer do
  use GenServer

  alias Rexbug, as: TraceClient

  @timeout 2_000
  @max_number_of_messages 100_000

  # Client
  def start_link(opts) do
    GenServer.start_link(__MODULE__, :ok, opts)
  end

  def trace do
    GenServer.call(Tracer, {:trace})
  end

  def get_results do
    GenServer.call(Tracer, :get_results)
  end

  # Server (callbacks)
  @impl true
  def init(:ok) do
    {:ok, []}
  end

  @impl true
  def handle_call({:trace}, _from, state) do
    TraceClient.start(
      [
        "Main.Suspect :: return"
      ],
      time: @timeout,
      msgs: @max_number_of_messages,
      print_fun: fn entry -&gt; GenServer.call(Tracer, {:trace_entry, entry}) end
    )

    try do
      Main.Suspect.call()
    rescue
      _ -&gt; nil
    end

    TraceClient.stop()

    {:reply, :ok, state}
  end

  @impl true
  def handle_call({:trace_entry, trace_entry}, _from, state) do
    {:reply, trace_entry, state ++ [trace_entry]}
  end

  @impl true
  def handle_call(:get_results, _from, state) do
    result =
      Enum.map(state, fn entry -&gt;
        {action, {{module, function, args}, retn}, {_, _}, {_, _, _, _}} = entry

        %{
          type: action,
          module: module,
          function: function,
          arguments: inspect(args),
          return_value: inspect(retn)
        }
      end)

    {:reply, {:ok, result}, []}
  end
end
</code></pre>

<p>With that good old GenServer approach, I can now trace my suspect whenever I want, and all traces gathered with my friends – redbug and rexbug are passed to my GenServer state, waiting there until I fetch them.</p>

<p>It is easy to use my work simply as</p>

<pre><code>Tracer.trace()
</code></pre>

<p>and after traces are gathered fetch them as</p>

<pre><code>case Tracer.get_results() do
  {:ok, results} -&gt; results
  {:error, error} -&gt; error
end
</code></pre>

<p>With all that, I get results in a nice form where I can see all suspect's interactions – what they received, and what they gave in return</p>

<pre><code>{:ok,
 [
  %{
	 arguments: "we have to stash that gold somewhere",
	 function: :heist,
	 module: Main.Suspect,
	 return_value: "\"\"",
	 type: :call
  },

  ...

  %{
	 arguments: "1",
	 function: :heist,
	 module: Main.Suspect,
	 return_value: "{:error, \"uh! oh! they\'ve got me\"}",
	 type: :retn
  }
]}
</code></pre>

<p>Everything was there, right in front of me, now I could trace all naughty functions visited by my suspect, I knew what he passed to them and what they gave in return. That knowledge was exciting and scary at the same time. There was nothing he can do to hide anymore; even if he hides in the most complex part of the city, I will be there, always watching, always knowing.</p>

<p>I'm closing this case. The lady who started it decided to use this knowledge for good and created an excellent document where everyone could check what our suspect does in the city. It was a game-changer as no villain could hide anymore from good citizens of Beamopolis. Everyone was cheerful – until one day – I've picked up another phone call …</p>

<![CDATA[(Very) Basic Intro to Elliptic Curve Cryptography]]>

February 12, 2021 | https://qvault.io/2020/09/17/very-basic-intro-to-elliptic-curve-cryptography/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://qvault.io/2020/09/17/very-basic-intro-to-elliptic-curve-cryptography/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
<p>Elliptic curve cryptography is a modern <a aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://searchsecurity.techtarget.com/definition/public-key" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">public-key&nbsp;encryption&nbsp;</a>technique based on mathematical elliptic curves and is well-known for creating smaller, faster, and more efficient cryptographic keys. For example, <a aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://bitcoin.org/" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Bitcoin</a> uses ECC as its asymmetric cryptosystem because of its lightweight nature.</p>
<p>In this introduction to ECC, I want to focus on the high-level ideas that make <a aria-label="ECC (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic-curve_cryptography" target="_blank">ECC</a> work. For the purposes of keeping this article easier to digest, I’ll omit implementation details and mathematical proofs, we can save those for another time.</p>
<h2>What is elliptic curve cryptography used&nbsp;for?</h2>
<p>A common use of ECC is to encrypt data so that only authorized parties can decrypt it. This has several obvious use cases but is most often used to encrypt internet traffic. For example, on the <a href="https://qvault.io/">Qvault web app</a> I could used ECC to encrypt a verification email so that no one but the recipient can read the message.</p>
<h2>ECC is public-key cryptography</h2>
<p>There are many types of public-key cryptography, and Elliptic Curve Cryptography is just one flavor. Other algorithms include <a aria-label="RSA (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_(cryptosystem)" target="_blank">RSA</a>, <a aria-label="Diffie-Helman (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffie%E2%80%93Hellman_key_exchange" target="_blank">Diffie-Helman</a>, etc. Let’s go over a quick background of public-key cryptography as a jumping-off point, so that I can discuss ECC and build on top of these ideas. By all means, study more in-depth on public-key cryptography when you have the time.</p>
<p>Public-key cryptography allows the following to happen:</p>

<p>We create two keys, a public key, and a private key. The public key is given freely, and any party can encrypt data by using it. However, the private key is kept secret and only those who hold it will have the ability to decrypt data.</p>
<h2>An example of public-key cryptography</h2>
<p>Let’s pretend that Facebook is going to receive a private post from Donald Trump. Facebook needs to be able to ensure that when the ex-president sends his post over the internet, no one in the middle (Like the NSA, or an internet service provider) can read the message. The entire exchange using public-key cryptography would go like this:</p>
<ul><li>Donald Trump Notifies Facebook that he wants to send them a private post</li><li>Facebook sends Donald Trump their public key</li><li>Donald Trump uses the public key to encrypt his post:</li></ul>
<p><em>“I love Fox and Friends” + Public Key = “s80s1s9sadjds9s”</em></p>
<ul><li>Donald Trump sends only the encrypted message to Facebook</li><li>Facebook uses its private key to decrypt the message:</li></ul>
<p><em>“s80s1s9sadjds9s” + Private Key = “I love Fox and Friends”</em></p>
<p>As you can see, this form of encryption can be quite useful. Here are some key points:</p>
<ul><li>The public key can safely be sent to anyone. It’s public.</li><li>The private key must be kept safe because if someone in the middle were to get the private key, they could decrypt messages.</li><li>Computers can quickly use the public key to encrypt a message, and quickly use the private key to decrypt a message.</li><li>Computers require a <em>very</em> long time (millions of years) to derive the original data from the encrypted message if they don’t have the private key.</li></ul>
<h2>How it Works: The Trapdoor&nbsp;Function</h2>
<p>The crux of all public-key cryptographic algorithms is that they each have their own unique trapdoor function<strong>. </strong>A trapdoor function is a function that can only be computed one way, or at least can only be computed one way <em>easily</em> (in less than millions of years using modern computers).</p>
<h3>Not a trapdoor function:</h3>
<p><code>A + B = C</code></p>
<p>If I’m given A and B I can compute C. However, if I’m given B and C I can also compute A. This is not a trapdoor function.</p>
<h3>Trapdoor function:</h3>
<p><code>"I love Fox and Friends” + Public Key --&gt; s80s1s9sadjds9s</code></p>
<p>If given <em>“I love Fox and Friends”</em> and the public key, I can produce <code>s80s1s9sadjds9s</code>, but if given <code>s80s1s9sadjds9s</code> and the Public Key I can’t produce <em>“I love Fox and Friends”</em></p>
<p>In RSA, which is arguably the most widely used public-key cryptosystem, the trapdoor function relies on how hard it is to factor large numbers into their prime factors.</p>
<p><strong>Public Key:</strong> <code>944,871,836,856,449,473</code></p>
<p><strong>Private Key:</strong> <code>961,748,941</code> and <code>982,451,653</code></p>
<p>In the example above the public key is a very large number, and the private key is the two prime factors of the public key. This is a good example of a Trapdoor Function because it is very easy to multiply the numbers in the private key together to get the public key, but if all you have is the public key it will take a very long time using a computer to re-create the private key.</p>
<p><em>Note: In real cryptography, the private key would need to be 200+ digits long to be considered secure.</em></p>
<h2>What Makes Elliptic Curve Cryptography Different?</h2>
<p>You would use ECC for the same reasons as RSA. ECC and RSA both generate a public and private key and allow two parties to communicate securely. One advantage to ECC however, is that a 256-bit key in ECC offers about the same security as a 3072-bit key using RSA. ECC allows resource-constrained systems like smartphones, embedded computers, and cryptocurrency networks to use ~10% of the storage space and bandwidth required by RSA.</p>
<h2>ECC’s Trapdoor&nbsp;Function</h2>
<p>This is probably why most of you are here. The trapdoor function is what makes ECC special and different than RSA. The trapdoor function is similar to a mathematical game of pool.</p>
<p>First, we start with an arbitrary point on the curve. Next, we use the dot function to find a new point. Finally, we keep repeating the dot function to hop around the curve until we finally end up at our last point. Let’s walk through the algorithm.</p>

<ul><li>Starting at <code>A</code>:</li><li><code>A dot B = -C</code> (Draw a line from A to B and it intersects at -C)</li><li>Reflect across the X-axis from -C to C</li><li><code>A dot C = -D</code> (Draw a line from A to C and it intersects -D)</li><li>Reflect across the X-axis from -D to D</li><li><code>A dot D = -E</code> (Draw a line from A to D and it intersects -E)</li><li>Reflect across the X-axis from -E to E</li></ul>
<p>This is a great trapdoor function because if you know where the starting point (A) is and how many hops are required to get to the ending point (E), it’s very easy to find the ending point. On the other hand, if all you know is where the starting point and ending point are, it’s nearly impossible to find how many hops it took to get there.</p>
<p>Public Key: Starting Point A, Ending Point E</p>
<p>Private Key: Number of hops from A to E</p>
<h2>Questions?</h2>
<p>Here are a few questions I had when I first learned about ECC. Hopefully, I can address them properly.</p>
<h3>1. How is the second point found? If the dot function is basically drawing a line between two points, don’t you need a second point to start&nbsp;with?</h3>
<p>No. The second point (we will call it -R below) is actually the result of P dot P (let’s assume the first point is called P)</p>
<p><code>P dot P = -R</code></p>
<p>So what is <code>P dot P</code>? It is actually just the tangent line of P. See the graphic below:</p>

<h3>2. What happens if the dot function produces a line that will go way off out to some&nbsp;extreme?</h3>
<p>If the line doesn’t hit the curve close to the origin, we can actually define a maximum X value where the line will wrap back around and start from the beginning again. See the graphic below for an example.</p>

<h3>3. If the number of hops is the private key, can’t I just count the hops until I hit the endpoint?</h3>
<p>Nope! The number of hops is <em>very</em> large, something like <code>2^256</code>. It would take far too long to compute each hop one by one, for example <code>p dot p dot p dot p ...</code>.</p>
<p>If however, you know the number of hops you can use an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponentiation_by_squaring" target="_blank" aria-label="exponentiation (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">exponentiation</a> trick to find the ending point quite quickly. For example, and omitting the details of elliptic curve operations: <code>2P = P dot P</code> and then <code>4P = 2P dot 2P</code>. This allows you to get up to those crazy high calculations exponentially faster.</p>
<h2>Who Cares?</h2>
<p>ECC is used as the cryptographic key algorithm in Bitcoin because it potentially can save ~90% of the resources used by a similar RSA system. It seems that each year we see more systems moving from RSA to a more modern elliptic curve approach.</p>

						<p>When the US joined World War Two, it set back a number of peacetime R&amp;D projects. A team at Bell Labs had been studying some interesting properties of semiconducting substances, with the hope that they might find a way to replace the then-ubiquitous vacuum tube. But the exigencies of wartime complicated their plans—for one thing, the only supplier of sufficiently pure silicon was a German company—so they took a break to focus on wartime applications like radar. By the time they returned to regular work, the war was won, the US industrial base had dramatically ramped up (now DuPont, not German suppliers, made the world’s purest silicon), and the team had acquired an encyclopedic knowledge of how substances like silicon and germanium behave.</p>
<p>Two years later, the transistor was born.</p>
<p>Crises radically reshape priorities; they cancel some projects, and accelerate others. But another effect they have is to make people more conscious of the future. To struggle through a crisis is, implicitly, to view the future as a point very much worth getting to. The Bell Labs team certainly helped build a better postwar future, and arguably Covid-19 has pushed people in the same direction.</p>
<p>We shouldn’t expect the results of this to be visible just yet. Scientific progress is visible on a lag: while the <i>New York Times</i> did mention the invention of transistors, it was midway through a column called “news of the radio,” hardly an accurate assessment of the impact of one of the twentieth century’s great inventions. Fortunately, there are more real-time ways to approximate people’s attitudes towards the future—the stock market is a real-time dollar-weighted poll about what kinds of companies will matter, and how that’s changing.</p>
<p>One of the surprising consequences of the Covid-19 pandemic was that, after a brief and fearsome decline, overall asset prices rose. That’s partly an artifact of how policymakers responded to the pandemic; pumping liquidity into the market does help offset supply shocks, and some of that money finds its way into speculative vehicles. But even <i>within</i> the market, there’s been a striking rise in investor interest in electric vehicles, autonomous cars, AI, and software companies ranging from consumer-facing companies like Facebook and Google to complex enterprise products like Snowflake.</p>
<p>The market’s judgments always have to be taken judiciously. Humans are imperfect judges of the present, not to mention the future. And as the recent GameStop fireworks demonstrate, sometimes prices can be driven more by technical aspects of market structure than by a cold and calculating assessment of the net present value of future cash flows. Even GameStop’s run-up, though, was born out of forward-looking analysis of a business, not gambling. The original thesis behind buying GameStop, before it turned into a social movement devoted to punishing hedge funds, <i>was</i> an argument that the company was fundamentally underpriced—because the market had missed its opportunity to transcend brick-and-mortar retailing and digitize its business!</p>
<p>There are definite precedents for extrapolating about new concerns from stock prices. Defense stocks rise when war is rumored to be imminent, for example, and cyclical stocks’ performance tends to change ahead of macro data on the economic cycle. More narrowly, the economist Armen Alchian <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0929119914000546">deduced that hydrogen bombs use lithium by tracking the stock prices of mining companies</a>.</p>
<p>Today, the world’s most valuable automaker is Tesla, with a market capitalization of $827bn, compared to $232bn for runner-up Toyota. Tesla isn’t valued based on its current production (just under 500,000 vehicles annually, compared to Toyota’s 9.2 million) or high margins (it eked out a net profit margin of just under 2%, less than half of Toyota’s results). Instead, Tesla is valued based on three forward-looking intangibles: it’s a pure-play electric vehicle company, its brand name is synonymous with clean energy rather than the more mixed reaction General Motors or Hyundai might engender, and its charismatic CEO has been able to recruit cult-like adherents to his vision of sustainable transportation and a multiplanetary species.</p>
<p>Calling Tesla is a cult isn’t pejorative, just descriptive: any organization that successfully accomplishes something that is widely believed to be impossible has to have distinctive beliefs, and any group of people who behave in unusual ways because of shared beliefs can be reasonably described as a cult. Some companies use their cultish aspects in harmful ways, but cults are a social design pattern that shows up over and over again, in successful companies and political movements. Cult-like traits are more common with companies that are growing fast—it would be hard for a steel mill or a local bank to engender this kind of behavior in its employees. It’s a way to focus everyone’s energy on the future, and avoid distracting questions about whether or not that future is viable—a way to raise the variance of outcomes, which makes extreme upside scenarios possible while increasing the odds of failure.</p>
<p>Tesla is not the only futuristic vehicle stock to be accorded a high value by the stock market. In fact, it’s arguably among the more mature. There are at least earnings to put a price/earnings multiple on, whereas many of the more recent EV companies are at an earlier stage than that. Luminar Technologies, for example, went public through a reverse merger late last year, and currently has a market value of almost $11bn. The company has minimal sales ($11m over the last nine months) and is still pouring money into R&amp;D. But LiDAR appears to be the most promising way to get cars to full autonomy, so investors are willing to value it based on the chance that a) autonomous vehicles will happen, b) they’ll use LiDAR, c) they’ll use Luminar’s systems to do it, and d) Luminar will be able to earn acceptable margins selling it.</p>
<p>The joint probability of all of those possibilities is low if they’re independent: if there’s a 10% chance of autonomous vehicles, a 10% chance they’ll use LiDAR, a 10% chance that LiDAR-using AVs will use Luminar’s technology, and a 10% chance that Luminar will get good margins, then the odds of Luminar being a good investment work out to 0.01%. But the more ambitious a company is, the more its job is to make those variables <i>conditional</i> instead: the closer a company gets to being the <i>only</i> way a given technology can happen, the more technology risk becomes synonymous with business risk, which compresses the overall range of outcomes. It also solves for the viable-business condition: if there’s just one company that can make AVs possible, then that company will have the pricing power necessary to make them profitable, too.</p>
<p>This dynamic actually works in two directions: first, it means that the odds of Luminar selling LiDAR conditional on LiDAR becoming ubiquitous are higher, because the latter is most probably going to happen if the former is true. And second, it’s a recruiting tool: if there’s one company that has a reasonable shot at accomplishing something, and it’s a desirable goal, then the company has a monopoly on the kinds of employees who can achieve that goal. This is a point Peter Thiel articulates in <i>Zero to One</i>, and it’s one of the reasons technology companies have such a skewed distribution of outcomes. They articulate a variant view, which means they attract people who share that variant view—and since the argument is settled by technology and economics, they don’t have to persuade the rest of the world, just to offer a better product.</p>
<p>The rise of special purpose acquisition vehicles, or SPACs, is a general testament to a more forward-looking market. In a conventional IPO, an operating company sells shares to the public; with a SPAC, an empty shell company goes public, and then identifies a private company to merge with. Due to a quirk in securities laws, a traditional IPO prospectus only shows a company’s backwards-looking estimates, and makes heavily-qualified statements about the future. A company that goes public through a SPAC is technically engaging in a merger, rather than an IPO, and the rules are different. When a public company buys another company, securities laws allow it to talk about that company’s anticipated growth, or the likely cost savings of the merger. Similarly, SPAC offerings can talk up a company’s long-term prospects, and even make exact estimates of future revenue.</p>
<p>SPACs have existed for years, but they exploded in popularity in 2020. Of the 466 SPAC companies that went public from 2011 through 2020, 248 of them went public in 2020 alone. A number of technical forces drove this—a large number of private companies looking for acquisitions, investors eager to get into <i>any</i> growth company early, some technicalities around SPAC issuance that make them attractive to specialist hedge funds. But the key driver of excitement about SPACs is that they can take companies public based on a future-focused outlook.</p>
<p>When Virgin Galactic went public by merging with Chamath Palihapitiya’s Social Capital Hedosophia Holdings, the company, which has taken deposits but generated minimal revenue, was able to project $590 million in annual revenue in the year 2023, and over a quarter of a billion dollars in pretax, pre-depreciation earnings. While this was optimistic, it’s also demonstrative: a company like Virgin Galactic would have been almost impossible to take public in a conventional way, because backwards-looking financial statements showed only losses. it may not work out as a business, or live up to its projections, but those projections got more plausible once it had access to public markets for funding.</p>
<p>High valuations for money-losing, often pre-revenue companies remind people of the dot-com bubble, and it’s worth putting that bubble in perspective. Someone who bought the market at its peak in March 2000 has earned a 6% compounded return since then. …</p></div></div></div>

      <div><p><i>I sent this email to the whole team at YC yesterday:</i></p><p>When I joined&nbsp;YC&nbsp;7.5 years ago, there weren’t many people around. PG and Jessica were still running things. We had offices in Mountain View, Palo Alto, and on Kearny street, but they were nearly always empty. The only meeting on any calendar was the lunch on Thursdays where we’d talk about companies over takeout or at a table in a crowded restaurant.</p><p>The ways in which we’ve changed since then have been amazing to see.&nbsp;YC&nbsp;has grown in every way imaginable. The scope of what&nbsp;YC&nbsp;funds is larger. The team is bigger and more capable. The number of companies is pushing towards some ever receding upper bound. There’s more software, a larger community, and more programming designed to help&nbsp;YC&nbsp;founders build better futures.</p><p>I feel a deep sense of pride and honor at the part that I’ve played in that change and growth. I recall the first conversation I had with Aaron King about the Series A for Snapdocs. The questions he and I worked through were the kernel of the Series A program. I am amazed to see the directions in which Janelle is now building YCA. I’m grateful for the part I played in our conversations about growing beyond seed investing - conversations which eventually took shape as YCC. And, of course, there are fifteen batches worth of applications, interviews, dinners, office hours, and demo days rattling around in my head.<br></p><p>I’ve been thinking, recently, about the founders with whom I’ve had a chance to work. I’ve lost count of the number of incredible people I’ve gotten to know over these last years. Thinking back, it’s easy to see how the sheer weight of numbers can drive a person to be jaded about the problems that founders face. But the other night, as I spoke with a founder about a tough situation, I was reminded about how important it is to that individual that she gets the best possible advice. This is a lesson I learned time and again, and is something I hope I’ll never forget.</p><p>And then there’s the funny stuff. There were stolen air conditioners, barefoot pitches, robots that did not make sandwiches, update emails pulled from the I Ching, bandages, inhaled jet fuel, and literal blood on the interview floors. These are the things that I’ll remember long after everything else.</p><p>The truth is, I only meant to stick around&nbsp;YC&nbsp;for two years. Somehow, that two became two more, and then some more. As meaningfully as I’ve enjoyed my work here, it’s time for me to move onto something different and new and outside the bounds of what&nbsp;YC&nbsp;does. That’s a strange, exhilarating moment, and an important one for me and for my family. The pandemic provided the practical and existential nudge I needed to see the depth of this need.</p><p>To my fellow partners - thank you for your tireless work for our founders and for&nbsp;YC. Thank you for everything you’ve taught me, for all the strange conversations we’ve had, and for all the demo day presentations we’ve crafted.</p><p>To PG and Jessica and Trevor and RTM - thank you for giving me this opportunity and for making&nbsp;YC&nbsp;the kind of place I could love enough to stay long after I meant to leave.</p><p>To Janelle - thank you for building YCA with me and for being the best person I could imagine to take it into the future.</p><p>To everyone else -&nbsp;YC’s mission in the world is abstract. It could mean so many things, but it wouldn’t be anything without your work. Whether you are managing founder expectations about housing in the Bay Area, helping someone understand the mysteries of cap tables, talking someone down off the ledge of yelling at a reporter, or making sure that there will one day be an office to come back to, you are what makes&nbsp;YC&nbsp;a viable, vital force in the world.</p><p>I’ve never liked&nbsp;goodbye.</p><p>aaron</p></div>

  <p><strong>TLDR:</strong> The most common implementations of the factorial function in C do not handle
errors correctly and have typical code vulnerabilities. The factorial function should
include error handling even when only for the goal of teaching recursion, so that
beginners get used to writing robust code.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> If you need a real factorial function, or its logarithm to do number theoretical
calculations, it’s available in the C standard library as <code>tgammal()</code> and <code>lgammal()</code>
functions <a href="#ref-glibc-math">[1]</a><a href="#ref-posix-tgammal">[2]</a><a href="#ref-posix-lgammal">[3]</a>.</p>

<p><span>!☕</span> The C language was created shortly after the Unix
operating system in the 1970’s, so that the new operating system could be written in a
simple and efficient programming language, instead of
assembly <a href="#ref-chistory">[4]</a>. Portability soon became a motivation too: to be able
to run Unix and applications in heterogeneous systems caused the operating system and the
C programming language to have a profound and long lasting impact on computer
systems <a href="#ref-tiobe-index">[5]</a><a href="#ref-stackoverflow">[6]</a><a href="#ref-ctoday">[7]</a><a href="#ref-unixhistory">[8]</a><a href="#ref-unixtoday">[9]</a>.
Simplicity, efficiency and portability, built into the language and transformed into
programming philosophy, came with a price. When programming in C, if you want it, you’ll
have it. That includes writing broken code, invoking behavior not defined by the language
and, in general, allowing you, without questioning, to “shoot your own foot”. Those who do
not program in C might believe this wouldn’t affect them. Remember, though, that many
modern languages were influenced and even replicated C syntax and
behavior <a href="#ref-cfamily">[10]</a>. Even for languages that were not directly influenced
by C, simplicity and efficiency requirements may still cause a lot of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_least_astonishment" target="_blank">astonishment</a>.</p>

<p>In this post, we’ll begin by writing a couple of factorial function implementations in C
that 9 out of the first 10 Google Search results implement. Then, we’ll discuss the
problems, present a minimal robust implementation and finally discuss about different ways
of doing error handling in C, so that, in the end you feel motivated to always write
robust code.</p>

<h3 id="recursive-factorial">Recursive factorial</h3>

<p>So here we go, this is the “Google version” of the recursive factorial function written in
C:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
</span>
<span>int</span> <span>factorial</span><span>(</span><span>int</span> <span>n</span><span>)</span>
<span>{</span>
	<span>/* This basic recursive factorial function is widespread
	 * on the Internet, but results in incorrect results most
	 * of the time, contains a stack overflow and integer
	 * underflow. */</span>
	<span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>n</span> <span>==</span> <span>0</span><span>)</span> <span>return</span> <span>1</span><span>;</span>

	<span>return</span> <span>n</span><span>*</span><span>factorial</span><span>(</span><span>n</span><span>-</span><span>1</span><span>);</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>int</span> <span>main</span><span>(</span><span>void</span><span>)</span>
<span>{</span>
	<span>int</span> <span>x</span><span>;</span>

	<span>/* Missing error checking on standard I/O. */</span>
	<span>printf</span><span>(</span><span>"Input a number: "</span><span>);</span>
	<span>scanf</span><span>(</span><span>"%d"</span><span>,</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>x</span><span>);</span>
	<span>printf</span><span>(</span><span>"The factorial of %d is: %d</span><span>\n</span><span>"</span><span>,</span> <span>x</span><span>,</span> <span>factorial</span><span>(</span><span>x</span><span>));</span>

	<span>return</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Let’s compile and run this program:</p>

<pre><code>$ cc -o fact0 fact0.c
$ ./fact0
Input a number: 100
The factorial of 100 is: 0
$
</code></pre>

<p>So the factorial of 100 is 0. Or is it ? Factorials are positive integers. Have we
written anything wrong ? A quick search online shows that there are indeed
implementations exactly like this and that the mathematical recursive formula for the
factorial is correct. Also, for some numbers the program correctly calculates the result:</p>

<pre><code>$ ./fact0
Input a number: 5
The factorial of 5 is: 120
$ ./fact0
Input a number: 12
The factorial of 12 is: 479001600
$
</code></pre>

<h3 id="interlude-factorial-in-python">Interlude: factorial in Python</h3>

<p>Let’s put this code on hold for a moment and implement exactly the same algorithm in
Python:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>#!/usr/bin/env python3
</span><span>def</span> <span>factorial</span><span>(</span><span>n</span><span>):</span>
    <span># Incomplete factorial implementation, but better than C
</span>    <span># (all behavior is defined by the language).
</span>    <span>if</span> <span>n</span> <span>==</span> <span>0</span><span>:</span> <span>return</span> <span>1</span>

    <span>return</span> <span>n</span><span>*</span><span>factorial</span><span>(</span><span>n</span><span>-</span><span>1</span><span>)</span>

<span>def</span> <span>main</span><span>():</span>
    <span>x</span> <span>=</span> <span>int</span><span>(</span><span>input</span><span>(</span><span>'Input a number: '</span><span>))</span>
    <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>'The factorial of %d is: %d'</span> <span>%</span> <span>(</span><span>x</span><span>,</span> <span>factorial</span><span>(</span><span>x</span><span>)))</span>

<span>if</span> <span>__name__</span> <span>==</span> <span>'__main__'</span><span>:</span> <span>main</span><span>()</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Running this program outputs:</p>

<pre><code>$ ./fact.py
Input a number: 100
The factorial of 100 is: 93326215443944152681699238856266700490715968264381621468592963895217599993229915608941463976156518286253697920827223758251185210916864000000000000000000000000
$ ./fact.py
Input a number: 5
The factorial of 5 is: 120
$ ./fact.py
Input a number: 12
The factorial of 12 is: 479001600
$
</code></pre>

<p>Ok, now it makes sense. The Python programming language, using arbitrary precision integer
numbers is able to correctly calculate the factorial using the recursive formula. In the
case of C, the integer data type (<code>int</code>) is a fixed width binary integer number (on my
computer, a 32-bit integer), without a defined overflow behavior. I can confirm this is
causing problems by using the undefined behavior detector library from my C compiler:</p>

<pre><code>$ cc -o fact0 fact0.c -fsanitize=undefined
$ ./fact0
Input a number: 100
fact0.c:10:10: runtime error: signed integer overflow: 13 * 479001600 cannot be represented in type 'int'
The factorial of 100 is: 0
$
</code></pre>

<p>So, that’s it, we’ve found it. Not only integer overflow is happening, we’ve confirmed by
using the undefined behavior detector that signed integer overflow in C is undefined
behavior. Due to the motivation of being small, efficient and portable to write an
operating system 50 years ago, the language rules won’t bother considering this case: what
happens when an integer operation overflows ? The language states that it’s
undefined. Anything is allowed to happen (like crashing the program or exploding a
spaceship). The reason for this is that this might be used for some kind of benefit,
typically related to performance and compiler simplicity, for a certain type of computer.
For example, for my compiler with default flags, integer overflows simply wrap around to
the minimum possible value because, when compiled, it results in the fastest possible
integer arithmetic code for my machine, and could be used for modular value calculations,
if desired. Other computers are free to implement a different behavior, also striving for
the fastest performance, if desired. This means that undefined behavior in C is part of
the language specification that helps guaranteeing that the language will be both portable
and performant in heterogeneous systems. Undefined behavior is arguably one of the reasons
C is so widespread for writing high performance system software. Consider, for example,
the modern high performance language <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/" target="_blank">Rust</a>,
praised for its modern safety features <a href="#ref-rustsafety">[11]</a>, and, in my opinion,
one of the best contenders for replacing C++ in the near future, also
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch03-02-data-types.html?highlight=overflow#integer-overflow" target="_blank">opting to allow silent integer overflows, yet stating that relying on it is considered an error</a>.
More commonly nowadays, however, since computers are becoming more homogeneous, the
unexpected result will simply cause a bug, without offering any other portability benefit.
Worse yet, in our specific case, compiling with default flags mentioned nothing. The
programmer was allowed to do that and the C compiler was silent about that.</p>

<h3 id="as-buggy-as-possible">As buggy as possible</h3>

<p>In the latest international C draft standard (ISO C 2017/2018 <a href="#ref-isoc17">[12]</a>),
undefined behavior is defined as the following:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>3.4.3 undefined behavior</p>

  <p>behavior, upon use of a nonportable or erroneous program construct or of erroneous data,
for which this International Standard imposes no requirements</p>

  <p>(…)</p>

  <p>EXAMPLE An example of undefined behavior is the behavior on integer overflow.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If the C programming language “imposes no requirements” on the behavior of integer
overflow, someone must. That someone is you, the programmer. You are allowed to shoot
your own foot, but if you’re smart you won’t.</p>

<p>Now any pragmatic programmer would think that this discussion doesn’t really make sense,
since the only goal of the recursive factorial function is to teach recursion and only
scratch the surface of C programming, so this discussion is meaningless. If that were the
whole story I would agree with that too and never waste my time writing this, but the
truth is that even though we must keep it simple, we have gone too far:</p>

</blockquote>

<p>In the C factorial example we have gone beyond as simple as possible and the code has
become oversimplified and thus incorrect. What I’m talking about is the amount of program
failures caused by buffer overflows, rounding errors, uninitialized memory access,
insufficient input validations and others that are main causes of electronic device
misbehaviors and exploitations in modern information technology. Famous bugs include the
$370 million Ariane 5 rocket explosion <a href="#ref-ariane5">[13]</a> and the Year 2000
bug <a href="#ref-y2k">[14]</a>, both caused by numeric overflows. Less impactful were the
integer overflows caused by the addictive Gangnam Style music video being viewed more than
2^31 times on YouTube <a href="#ref-gangnam">[15]</a> and Paypal depositing $92 quadrillion
(2^63 dollars) into the account of a user <a href="#ref-quadrillion">[16]</a>. On the other
hand, the cyberwarfare Stuxnet virus, believed to have been created by the Israeli and
American governments to damage Iranian uranium enrichment

        <h4>February 12th, 2021 · 5 minute read</h4>

        <p>
          I've seen quite a <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=21990566">few</a> <a href="https://blog.pushbullet.com/2020/05/13/lets-guess-what-google-requires-in-14-days-or-they-kill-our-extension/">people</a> <a href="https://blog.lipsurf.com/part-ii-after-3-years-of-work-chrome-killed-my-extension-and-wont-tell-me-why/">complaining</a> lately about the Kafkaesque Chrome extension review process, so when I started running into my own problems with the Chrome Web Store I wasn't exactly surprised.
        </p>

        <p>
          It wasn’t until I submitted the same extension to the Firefox Add-Ons Store that I saw just how good things could be. In a world of walled gardens watched over by heavy handed reviewers, Firefox's review process was laughably good.
        </p>

        <section>
          

          <p>
            In January 2020 my buddy and I started working on an idea we had for an automation app. We called it Otto.
          </p>

          <p>
            Otto consisted of two parts: a Mac app and a browser extension. After a few months worth of nights and weekends we had an alpha version we were ready to share with friends. I submitted the browser extension to Chrome under my own personal account, and after a review process of a couple days it was accepted. So far so good.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          

          <p>
            The trouble started a few months later. After some more development and discussion, we re-framed our idea as an app to make custom keyboard shortcuts and we decided to rename Otto to <a href="https://keysmith.app/">Keysmith</a>. We also took the time at this point to create a company Google account. We renamed the extension and submitted it from our new company account.
          </p>

          <p>
            To be clear: changing the name was the <i>only</i> change we made.
          </p>

          <p>
            A few days later we received a rejection email. Here's a timeline of our interaction:
          </p>

          <div>
            
            <p>
                We submit Keysmith to the Chrome Web Store.
              </p>
          </div>

          <div>
            
            <div>
              <p>
                First rejection email.

                Quick summary:
              </p>

              <ul>
                <li>Keysmith "violates the 'Use of Permissions' section"</li>
                <li>We should "Request access to the narrowest permissions necessary"</li>
                <li>"If more than one permission could be used to implement a feature, you must request those with the least access to data or functionality."</li>
                <li>We shouldn't attempt to "future proof"</li>
              </ul>
            </div>
          </div>

          <div>
            
            <div>
              <div><p>
                We double check the permissions we've requested and can't find any problems. We respond asking for more detail.
                </p><p>
                We also mention that we had previously submitted the <i>same</i> extension with the <i>same</i> requested permissions, just under a different name (Otto). We hoped they'd say "oh, in that case we'll approve this right away!". But instead:
              </p></div>
            </div>
          </div>

          <div>
            
            <p>
                Otto, our <i>existing extension</i>, is removed from the store and no additional detail on the rejection is provided. In fact, this email contains the <i>same exact</i> text as the previous one.
              </p>
          </div>

          <div>
            
            <p>
                We respond, again asking for more detail. We ask if it would help if we expanded on how we're using each permission in the permissions justification section.
              </p>
          </div>

          <div>
            
            <p>
                They respond with the <i>exact same text again</i>. No further detail. No help at all.
              </p>
          </div>

          <div>
            
            <p>
                We suspect these reviews are entirely automated, so we ask if we can speak to a "human reviewer", hoping this will trigger a manual review (we also consider dropping an f-bomb for the same reason, but decide to remain decent for now).
              </p>
          </div>

          <div>
            
            <p>
                They respond with some <i>slightly</i> different text, but still nothing useful.
              </p>
          </div>

          <div>
            
            <p>
                We try adding a lot more detail to the "justification" section for each of the permissions we use and we resubmit.
              </p>
          </div>

          <div>
            
            <p>
                They respond with the exact same text as the first rejection.
              </p>
          </div>

          <div>
            
            <p>
                We respond with one more plea for more more information.
              </p>
          </div>

          <div>
            
            <p>
                They respond with the same text again.
              </p>
          </div>
        </section>

        <section>
          

          <p>
            At this point I dig into Chrome's documentation once again with a fine-tooth comb and I make a discovery: we had been requesting both the <span>tabs</span> and <span>activeTab</span> permissions, but since we also requested permission to run on <span>&lt;all_urls&gt;</span> it turns out that the features made available by <span>activeTab</span> were a strict subset of the features made available by <span>tabs</span>. So the <span>activeTab</span> permission was redundant. We weren't opening up any new functionality, we were just asking for a <i>redundant</i> permission.
          </p>

          <p>
            This discovery made the Chrome review team's communications far more frustrating in retrospect. The line that all of their emails repeated was "Request access to the narrowest permissions necessary". And, sure, we had asked for <span>activeTab</span> when we didn't need it, but that permission <i>didn't grant us any more functionality</i>. They had rejected our extension 6 times with no detail <i>because of a technicality</i>.
          </p>

          <p>
            We committed the 1 line diff removing the <span>activeTab</span> permission and resubmitted. A day later it was accepted.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          

          <p>
            A Firefox version of our browser extension had long been on our list, but for the first little while it didn't feel worth the additional support cost. We didn't know exactly how large that cost would be, but we suspected that there would be enough differences between the two browsers that it'd be a bit of a hassle to maintain them both.
          </p>

          <p>
            Boy were we wrong. When we finally started looking into porting our extension to Firefox we found that we had to make <i>zero</i> changes to the code. None whatsoever. Firefox even supported the use of the global <span>chrome</span> object for accessing extension APIs (if you're curious, Chrome is not kind enough to return the favor).
          </p>

          <p>
            So we created a Firefox developer account, submitted our extension, and girded ourselves for another rough ride.
          </p>

          <p>
            <i>Boy were we wrong.</i>
          </p>

          <div>
            
            <p>
                We submit the first version of our extension to Firefox.
              </p>
          </div>

          <div>
            
            <div>
              <div><p>
                Less than 3 hours later we receive an email from Firefox that says, in effect, "Sorry this is taking so long, but we'll get to it soon!"
                </p><p>
                Responses from the Chrome team usually came in the wee hours of the morning, making the effective turnaround about 24 hours. Firefox apologizing after fewer than 3 hours was <i>hilarious</i> to us.
              </p></div>
            </div>
          </div>

          <div>
            
            <p>
                We get an email saying the extension was accepted exactly 24 hours after submission.
              </p>
          </div>

          <p>
            Further updates have been even speedier, usually only taking 2 or 3 minutes to be scanned and accepted. One of our updates even got accepted before I finished uploading the unminified source archive (which they require if you minify in production). And the dashboard shows your position in the review queue to give you some idea of when it'll complete.
          </p>

          <p>
            Needless to say, this was a breath of fresh air, and we won't be neglecting support for Firefox ever again in the future.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          

          <p>
            I realize that in some ways this is an unfair comparison. Chrome's market share is much larger than Firefox's these days, so surely they also have to deal with far more extension submissions.
          </p>

          <p>
            But the lack of transparency in their process was infuriating and counter-productive. Had someone taken the time to manually review our case, or at least <i>read any of the emails</i> we sent, we could've resolved this issue with one response. Instead it took 6 responses and a week of wondering if this review process would kill our product before it even launched.
          </p>

          <p>
            I really hope things improve, but I'm not counting on it.
          </p>

<p>Alan G. Carter</p>
<i><p>alan@melloworld.com</p>
</i>
<p>9th May 1999</p>

</span><b><i><span face="Arial"><p>Introduction</p>
</span></i></b><span face="Arial" size="2">
<p>This paper presents a deep logical error in most people's thinking, that is introduced right at the beginning of thought, and then stays in the thinking until the conclusions are reached. The conclusions are then wrong, but when they are examined there doesn't seem to be anything wrong with them. Nor does there seem to be anything wrong with the reasoning - as people check back, each step seems to be correct. This is because the error was already in place before reasoning began. Even worse, the conclusions people reach in one area seem to match the conclusions they reach in other areas. This is because the error has a particular character wherever it appears, so one conclusion that contains the error has a relationship with another that also contains the error, which makes them match up.</p>

<p>The problem distorts deductive reasoning. It does not distort inductive reasoning, but it makes inductive reasoning appear inadmissible to many people who have done some deductive reasoning with the Ghost Not and turned their minds effectively inside out.</p>

<p>The effect of this has been to create the "Two Half Cultures"  (not "Two Cultures" as C. P. Snow claimed - he was seeing double), as well as the single Culture we should have. The three groups are usually called:</p>

<b></b><p><b>Artists.</b> They use intense inductive reasoning (intuition) to spot implicit patterns and express them. They shun deductive reasoning and claim that it is in itself flawed. For some this leads to a paradox of trying to achieve clarity without being clear, which the best avoid by achieving expressions that are deeper than words. Since their social interactions are Ghost Not polluted, they learn to maintain a buffer zone around their art, which they simply refuse to allow any deductive discussion of. This impoverishes society, since there are a great many truths that can be <i>understood</i> deductively but cannot be <i>reached</i> deductively, as Kurt Godel proved in mathematics. </p>

<b></b><p><b>Scientists. </b>They use deductive reasoning to analyse explicit patterns and express them. They shun inductive reasoning because they have the Ghost Not inspired delusion that phenomena do not exist unless they themselves know of a viable causal mechanism at that moment. The best of them avoid this problem by achieving paradigm shifts - recastings of the perceived universe that are deeper than words. Since most scientists believe that is it their primary duty to enforce the orthodox paradigm rather than discover the truth, achieving a paradigm shift usually involves waiting for a generation of scientists to die, as Thomas Kuhn explained.</p>

<b></b><p><b>Alchemists.</b> They use deductive reasoning to illuminate the harmonies they perceive inductively. They use their logic to track what is there rather than what they have admitted to their inner simulations. By seeing what is there they have no conflict between deductive and inductive perceptions, and the correct single mode of perception emerges. The results of their contemplations are immediately encoded as modifications to their own perceptions, in a way that is deeper than words. They come to see on all the levels and into all the worlds. They never forget. They freely mix the tools and language of artists and scientists in a way that the half cultures insist is impossible. As they do so, they realise that the single way of seeing is a reality that "art" and "science" (as these words are usually understood) are mere shadows of. Isaac Newton was an alchemist in the true meaning of the word, and all the great mystical teachers prize rational thinking.</p>

<p>This is an alchemical paper. It starts by borrowing from van Gogh to describe the core idea of seeing like an artist that it is going to explore. Scientists should not be worried about this - where do axioms come from? Then van Gogh, Magritte and Freud help to compare seeing like an artist to the way most people currently do seeing. Then it makes an important philosophical point about the property of symmetry that is found in our universe, and just where we can and cannot reasonably expect to find it, with a little help from Allen Ginsberg. All of these ingredients are then put into a single context, using the Primary Algebra of George Spencer-Brown.</p>

<p>As ideas from art criticism and mathematics are introduced, they are explained. It is very important that both artists and scientists reading this paper realise this, since it is only by using both aspects of the One Culture together that what this paper discusses can be fully understood. It is not the case that those parts that use mathematics are inherently beyond the comprehension of artists, or the other way around. Both are nothing without the other.</p>

<p>At this point the Ghost Not is wholly exposed. The paper then builds up a series of examples, from the simplest logical OR operation through a few levels of mathematical examples to complex human emotional, social, philosophical and scientific contexts. At each level it shows how the Ghost Not appears to distort conclusions in its characteristic way. In the final sections, it makes some comments on a culture that has evolved with all of its thinking distorted by the Ghost Not. These are the areas where understanding the problem will allow us to make improvements.</p>
</span><b><i><span face="Arial"><p>Seeing Like An Artist</p>
</span></i></b><span face="Arial" size="2">
<p>We shall begin by asking what art is for. What does art do? One answer to this question is to say that it is <i>pretty</i> - decorous. This though, is a very shallow answer. Great art does more than cause nice feelings for us by being pretty. Great art captures in one (convenient) form, some deep and powerful thing usually found in another form. A few dyes daubed on canvas or a piece of hewn stone can capture something of a natural movement or a human emotion that excites, or challenges, or puzzles us. What art does is to <i>convey impressions</i>. Here are the awe inspiring forces of a storm, captured in daubings by Vincent van Gogh:</p>

<p><img src="http://www.datapacrat.com/Opinion/Reciprocality/r2/image3.jpg" width="324" height="155"></p>

<p>When he pulls the trick off, van Gogh has to do two quite distinct things. Firstly, he has to spot something worth conveying. This might just be something direct, such a particularly spectacular view. More usually, an artist will try to convey deeper impressions than this though. Here, what van Gogh has done is notice that the wheat in the field has been scraped into the same texture as the stormclouds. Although invisible, the same force (the wind) is behind both patterns. His painting thus celebrates the power of the wind, which cannot itself be painted because it is invisible. He then goes beyond this though, and shows that the track itself seems to have been pulled in the same way the wheat and the clouds have been. Can it be that there is a deeper principle behind both the wind and the historic forces that define the path of a track? Perhaps a modern physicist might think about fluid dynamics here - certainly the philosopher Plato would be sympathetic to the idea that the equations of fluid dynamics are "deeper" than their resultants - wind and track paths. Then look at the crows in the sky. They alone are not distorted by the action of this principle - the wind and perhaps what lies behind it. Perhaps the crows both individually and in their flock, are in some way creatures of - their behaviour is governed by - the same deep principle. Then look once again at the wheat. The raw energy that has scraped it is not the only thing that causes it to resemble the clouds, which have been shaped solely by the wind. It is quite clear that the scraped appearance of the wheat ears derives in part from the regular planting pattern that we see at the front of the picture. Is there another creature about whose nature derives from the deep principle behind wind and crows, that has done this?</p>

<p>Quite a lot of ideas for one eyeful. The sensibilities and editorial skills of van Gogh spotted an impression worth conveying, that caused him to experience a great deal of the world, in its own context, in one go. To do the job, van Gogh must allow sensory data to enter his eyes uncritically, and wait for the relationships that are implicit in the data to emerge as he rolls the raw data around in his head. When he had completed this task, the job of finding something to paint, his second task began. The second task was now to un-notice what he had noticed. Rather than paint a cloud that looked like a field, he must use his technical skill with his materials and a kind of <i>honesty</i> to simply record the visual image that had brought the impressions to his mind. He must leave it to the viewer of the painting to either agree with him or not, that the <i>data</i> he has recorded suggest a relationship between say, planted fields of wheat, windtorn clouds, and farm tracks. </p>

<p>In both of these tasks, van Gogh must perceive uncritically. He must allow sensory data to enter his awareness <i>without</i> asking what it "is", and only later in either his mind, or the mind of the viewer, should the pattern he will (or has) becomes aware of, take form. This is seeing like an artist. It is exactly the same as the <i>honesty</i> that the physicist Richard Feynman insisted is necessary to make any progress in understanding nature. See what is <i>there</i>, not what you <i>expect</i>.</p>

<p>Most people do not usually see like artists. Instead they do something more complicated that they have subconsciously learned to do. First, the sensory data enter their heads. That bit is unavoidable. At that point they categorise what they have seen. If it is a field of wheat before them, they categorise what they have seen as a general issue field of wheat. They then put a general issue field of wheat on a kind of internal whiteboard that they keep in their minds for this very purpose. Then they make with the exaggerated Marcel Marceau impersonation, step back from their whiteboard in amazement and cry, "Gosh! A field of wheat!" as if it were the first time they have seen it.</p>

		<h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>

<p>Dependencies makes it easy for developers to understand the architecture of their app. We also wanted to provide a simple solution to objectively measure the quality and the complexity of the architecture. That's the reason why we developed a new mathematical formula in the graph theory that we called <strong>Software Entropy</strong>.</p>

<p>Dependencies calculates and displays the Software Entropy of your app. In the following screenshot, the analyzed iOS framework has a Software Entropy with a value of 25. This low value clearly indicates a well structured code:</p>
<p><img src="https://dependencies.app/entropy/screenshot.png" alt="Entropy"></p><p>This paper describes the mathematical concept behind the <strong>Software Entropy</strong> and how to calculate it.</p>
<h3 id="why-the-need-for-a-new-mathematical-formula">Why the need for a new mathematical formula?</h3>

<p>Dependencies is able to extract the architecture of your app and create an interactive graph. From this graph, we want to calculate an objective score indicating the complexity of the architecture. This score needs to be agnostic to the programming language, i.e. you should be able to compare the score of an app written in Swift with the score of an app written in C++ or Objective-C.</p>

<p>There is a fairly well-known technique to measure the complexity of a program: in a paper titled “A Complexity Measure”, Thomas McCabe introduced the <strong>Cyclomatic Complexity</strong>, a mathematical formula to calculate the complexity of a program control flow. This was in… 1976! You can read the original publication <a href="http://www.literateprogramming.com/mccabe.pdf">here</a>.</p>

<p>However the Cyclomatic Complexity has various limitations which makes it unsuitable for our use case. It was defined with Fortran in mind at a time where Object-Oriented Programming was not widely popular: Objective-C and C++ were both developed around 1985…</p>

<p>Therefore the Cyclomatic Complexity is really limited to calculate the complexity of control flow graph, i.e. if-else statements. This technique is still useful for example to measure the complexity of a single function. This is relevant for unit testing and code coverage because it provides a good indicator on the number of test cases required to cover all branches.</p>

<p>Since we could not find a mathematical concept in the graph theory to give a meaningful complexity score for the architecture of an object-oriented software, we decided to define our own mathematical concept to fill this gap.</p>
<h3 id="definitions">Definitions</h3>
<br>
<h6 id="nodes-and-links">Nodes and links</h6>

<p>In the graph theory, a graph is a structure containing nodes linked together by links:</p>
<ul>
<li>the nodes are sometimes called vertices or points.</li>
<li>the links are sometimes called edges or lines. They join 2 nodes.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here is a graph with 5 nodes and 5 links:</p>

<br>
<h6 id="directed-graphs">Directed graphs</h6>

<p>For the Software Entropy, we will only deal with directed graphs: a link between the node 1 and the node 2 means that the node 1 depends on node 2 but node 2 doesn't depend on node 1:</p>


<p>A graph with 2 nodes (1 and 2) and 2 links (1→2, 2→1) is possible but loops are not allowed (a node can't link to itself):</p>
<br>

<br>
<h6 id="components">Components</h6>

<p>An important concept is the concept of components in a graph. To calculate the Software Entropy, we are only interested by weakly connected components, i.e. we ignore the direction of the links.</p>
<p>
This graph with 7 nodes and 7 links is composed of 2 components:
</p>
<h3 id="software-entropy-formula">Software Entropy formula</h3>

<p>The Software Entropy for a graph with one single component is calculated by the formula:</p>

<p>
	Software Entropy = L - N + 1
</p>
<p>where:</p>
<ul>
<li>N is the number of nodes</li>
<li>L is the number of links between nodes</li>
</ul>

<p>We can generalize this formula for a graph with C independent components as being the sum of the Software Entropy of each component:</p>

<p>
	Software Entropy = ∑(L<sub>C</sub> - N<sub>C</sub> + 1)
</p>
<p>where:</p>
<ul>
<li>N<sub>C</sub> is the number of nodes in the component C</li>
<li>L<sub>C</sub> is the number of links between nodes in the component C</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="property-the-software-entropy-is-a-positive-value">Property: the Software Entropy is a positive value</h3>

<p>One interesting property of the Software Entropy is that its value is always positive:</p>

<p>
	Software Entropy &gt;= 0
</p>
<ul>
<li>An empty graph (no component, no link, no node) has a Software Entropy of 0.</li>
<li>A graph containing a single node and no link has a Software Entropy of 0 - 1 + 1 = 0.</li>
<li>A component of N nodes contains at least (N - 1) links. As a consequence the Software Entropy for a component is positive.</li>
<li>The Software Entropy for a graph with multiple components is the sum of the Software Entropy of each component. As a consequence the Software Entropy for any graph is positive.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="meaning-of-the-software-entropy-for-the-app-architecture">Meaning of the Software Entropy for the app architecture</h3>

<p>In a well-structured app, you want to have separate components. You absolutely want to avoid that each class knows about all the other classes in your app.</p>

<p>If you represent the architecture of your app with a graph, each node representing a class or structure and each link representing a dependency between 2 classes, you want to minimize the number of links in the graph. The more dependencies you have between classes, the more chaotic your architecture is.</p>

<p>As a result, a well-structured architecture will tend to have a smaller Software Entropy than a poorly designed application.</p>

<p>A Software Entropy with the value 0 means that the architecture is ideal and only the minimum amount of links between classes are used. The greater the entropy, the more chaotic the architecture is. The Software Entropy can be use as an objective metric to ensure that your app is:</p>
<ul>
<li>well structured</li>
<li>highly testable</li>
<li>easy to maintain</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="examples">Examples</h3>

<p>A graph with a single node has a Software Entropy of <strong>0</strong> (0 link - 1 node + 1 = 0):</p>

<p>A graph with 2 nodes linked with 1 link has a Software Entropy of <strong>0</strong> (1 link - 2 nodes + 1 = 0):</p>

<p>A graph with 2 nodes linked with 2 links has a Software Entropy of <strong>1</strong> (2 links - 2 nodes + 1 = 1):</p>

<p>The following graph containing 4 nodes has a Software Entropy of <strong>0</strong> (3 links - 4 nodes + 1 = 0). It could correspond to the composition pattern in the Object Oriented concept:</p>

<p>The following graph containing 4 nodes has a Software Entropy of <strong>0</strong> (3 links - 4 nodes + 1 = 0). It could correspond to the inheritance pattern in the Object Oriented concept:</p>

<p>The following graph containing 4 nodes has a Software Entropy of <strong>1</strong> (4 links - 4 nodes + 1 = 1). It could correspond to the concept of Retain Cycle:</p>

<p>The following graph contains 2 components and has a Software Entropy of <strong>0</strong> (3 links - 4 nodes + 1) + (3 links - 4 nodes + 1) = 0:</p>

<p>The following graph contains 2 components and has a Software Entropy of <strong>3</strong> (5 links - 4 nodes + 1) + (4 links - 4 nodes + 1) = 3:</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Commercial open source software has always been a head scratcher for many: how exactly can you publish your entire code base online, make it free for people to download, but also create a viable business around it? Red Hat's IPO in '99 was a great result, but it was more of a one-of success than a playbook that other makers could follow. In the past decade open source has boomed in popularity, but the path to commercialization has gotten even more complicated, as the shift to the cloud put AWS and other providers in a position to easily host and redistribute open source project without rewarding the original creators. In this post we will dive into the history of open source software licensing, its evolution over the last 40 years, and what the future holds.</p><h2>"Open Letter to Hobbyists"</h2><p>Before the 70s, software was not considered copyrightable, and therefore had no licenses attached to it; early commercial products like IBM's mainframe software were distributed with source code included. The landscape started changing with the <em>"US Commission on New Technological Uses of Copyrighted Works (CONTU)"</em> of 1974, which stated that "computer programs, to the extent that they embody an author's original creation, are proper subject matter of copyright". In 1976, a young Bill Gates authored <a href="https://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/library/cyber/surf/072397mind-letter.html">"Open Letter to Hobbyists"</a> and published it on the New York Times; in the essay, Gates denounced people who obtained copies of BASIC without paying the license fee: "Who can afford to do professional work for nothing?". These copies were bootleg versions of the BASIC paper tape. One of the original tapes was stolen at a Homebrew Computer Club meetup in June 1975, and copies of it were redistributed at the following meeting.</p><p>The final nail in the coffin of public-domain software came with the verdict of <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Computer,_Inc._v._Franklin_Computer_Corp.">Apple vs Franklin</a></em> in 1983, which clarified that both the source code (the human-readable code) and the binary code (the machine readable code) of a program are covered by copyright. After Apple vs Franklin, the software landscape quickly started moving towards widespread licensing and binary-only distribution of software. IBM reverted its original policy and announced it'd be no longer distributing the source code along with software purchases. </p><p>"Free software" was now vulnerable to larger companies leveraging their source code and redistributing it as a commercial product. Apple itself was a clear representation of the divide between hobbyists, like Steve Wozniak and the Homebrew Computer Club, and more commercially-focused minds, like Steve Jobs and Bill Gates.</p><h2>The GNU Project and the birth of "Open Source"</h2><p>In the 1970s Richard Stallman, a Harvard graduate, spent time at MIT's AI laboratory where he built a reputation as a strong proponent of "free software". Disturbed by the development in the software licensing world, he founded <a href="https://www.gnu.org/gnu/thegnuproject.en.html">the GNU Project</a> in 1983, with the aim of representing and supporting the free software movement. The organization is responsible for the creation of the GNU General Public License (GPL) in 1989, which would then be adopted by leading projects of the time like Linux and MySQL.</p><p>The GPL leveraged a new concept called "copyleft". "Copyleft" allows software creators to grant users access to the source code of their applications and lets them create derivative work on top of it, but it requires that work to also adopt the same license. This makes it impossible for companies to take projects under "copyleft", package them and redistribute them as closed-source commercial products. The GPL was a pivotal moment in the history of open source software; to this day, the license is still leveraged by some of the most popular open source projects like Red Hat, MySQL, Git, and Ubuntu. </p><p>In 1997 Eric Raymond, a long-time Linux contributor, published <a href="http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/">"The Cathedral and the Bazaar"</a>, in which he talked about his experience in free software (the "Bazaar" model), and what his advantages are over the status quo of packaged software the industry offered (the "Cathedral" model). In summary, Raymond argues that the wisdom of the crowd offered by the Bazaar model generates better results than a small group of developers could. <em>"Given enough eyeballs, all bugs are shallow."</em> Netscape's CEO would mention Raymond's work as one of his inspirations when deciding to open source the browser (more on that later).</p><p>In that same year Christine Peterson, a fellow MIT alum, coined the term "open source" during a group meeting with Raymond and other "free software" leaders at the Foresight Institute. We should all consider ourselves lucky that "cooperatively developed" didn't win that fight! Raymond updated his essay accordingly on February 9th 1998 (<a href="http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/cathedral-bazaar/">"Changed free software to open source''</a>) and at the "Freeware Summit" of 1998, a vote was taken to adopt "Open source" as the standard term. The event was then renamed to "Open Source Summit", which still runs to the this day, supported by the Linux Foundation. </p><h2>Open Source goes commercial</h2><p>In March 1998, Netscape open sourced their Communicator 5.0 source code on their newly registered <a href="http://mozilla.org/">Mozilla.org</a> domain. This quote from Bob Lisbonne, SVP of client products at Netscape at the time, touches on one of the most important aspects of open source: the possibility of tapping into an unlimited pool of talent.</p><p>"It's no longer Netscape alone, pushing the client software forward, but now it's really the whole Net. For Netscape, this gives us a way to engage the creative, innovative abilities of literally orders of magnitude more people than we could ever--really any commercial software company could ever--afford to just put on their payroll." </p><p>The software was released under the <strong>Netscape Public License,</strong> which wasn't recognized as a true open source one, and <a href="https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/netscape-npl.html">received criticism by Richard Stallman</a>. Mozilla eventually spun out of Netscape, and launched the Firefox browser in 2002 under the <strong>Mozilla Public License.</strong> In that same time period, other open source projects were being launched both in enterprise contexts, like Sun Microsystems's <a href="http://openoffice.org/">OpenOffice.org</a> and Rapid7's Metasploit, but also in the gaming space, like Linden Lab's Second Life. In other cases, the open source project was preceding the company: Matt Mullenweg created WordPress in 2003, but only left CNET to start Automattic in 2006, and raised $1.1M in 2007. </p><p>In the early 2000s, licensing was still pretty straight forward, with most projects living under GPL or BSD licenses. The latter (not to be confused with Linux's BSD distribution) is one of the most permissive licenses, and doesn't require the disclosure of source code of derivative works. For example, I could take an open source BSD-licensed project, modify it, and redistribute it as commercial closed source product without issues. </p><p>GPL licenses on the other hand require you to disclose your source code if it leverages other GPL-licensed pieces of code. While great in theory, this is hard to enforce; if a closed source application uses GPL source code but I have no visibility into the code itself, how can I confirm it's in violation? <em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/blog/2008/dec/12/cisco-fsf-opensource">Free Software Foundation (FSF) vs Cisco</a></em> in 2008's was one of the first GPL lawsuits that were against a large enterprise.  In 2016 <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2016/11/wordpress-and-wix-trade-shots-over-alleged-theft-of-open-source-code/">Automattic accused Wix of using GPL-licensed code</a> in one of their projects, but quickly resolved the issue out of court. </p><p>As cloud computing became more popular in the 2000s, there was a major shift in the open source world. In the early days, a big part of the OSS community was individual developers participating in the development of these projects as a hobby; as time went on, open source became a larger focus for enterprises. This usually happens in two ways: </p><ul><li>The company uses an open sources project for marketing the company as a thought leader, as well as a recruiting tool to attract top talent to work on it (a good example of this is Google with TensorFlow in machine learning, but you also see it with React at Facebook)</li><li>An open source project is monetized through an open core or commercial open source strategy. This is the case for companies like MongoDB, Elastic, DataBricks, etc.</li></ul><p>This shift caused GPL to lose in popularity, as it'd require companies to open source their core products if they were to use their own open source work. Companies started moving to an Apache or MIT license. Nowadays, those two licenses account for more than 50% of all licenses. This also allowed the rise of startups that can help companies manage open source compliance, such as <a href="http://fossa.com/">FOSSA</a> and <a href="http://snyk.io/">Snyk</a>. </p><p><img src="https://alessiofanelli.com/images/screen-shot-2021-02-05-at-5.52.24-pm.png" alt="WhiteSource breakdown of licenses"></p><p><em>Credit to WhiteSource for the visualization</em></p><h2>Staying open source in a cloud-first world</h2><p>Open source software and cloud computing have been a big net positive for engineering teams around the world, drastically lowering the upfront cost and time to develop software. On the other hand, there's been a lot of discussion around whether or not cloud providers are taking advantage of open source projects, by leveraging their distribution channels to monetize open source work without giving anything back to the creators.</p><p>The community is somewhat split on this, with one side arguing that cloud providers don't owe anything to the creators, while the other side sees this as an ethical breach of the open source sentiment, even though it's technically legal. The next few years will be pivotal in deciding what the future of commercial open source looks like, especially from a licensing perspective. </p><p><strong>MongoDB</strong> was a pioneer of the first generation of large commercial open source companies. The first release of MongoDB came out in 2009; for the first few years the company behind it, at the time still named 10gen, didn't have a commercial product other than professional services and training. In 2013 they were named DB system of the year by DB-Engines, officially rebranded to MongoDB, and launched their first Enterprise version. The product was licensed under AGPLv3. The company grew very quickly and eventually went public in 2017. In 2018, MongoDB announced a license change, moving from AGPLv3 to a …</p></div></div>

<p>The ExpressCard to NVMe adapter allows you to install any PCI-E based M.2 2242 SSD in your EC-equipped ThinkPad. It supports plug and play, hotswap, and is even bootable.</p>
<p><em>SSD is not included.</em></p>
<h4>FAQ</h4>
<p><strong>What&nbsp;laptop models&nbsp;are compatible?</strong></p>
<p>Any laptop with an ExpressCard slot is compatible. When it comes to ThinkPads, that includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<u>ExpressCard 34</u><strong>:</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>T400s, T410/s, T420/s, T430/s, T510, T520, T530, T540p, W510, W520, W530, W540, W541, W700/ds, W701/ds, P50, P51, P70, P71</li>
<li>
<u>ExpressCard 54:</u><span>&nbsp;</span>R51e, R52, R60, R61, R400, R500, T43/p, T60/p, T61/p, T400, T500, Z60m, Z61m, W500, X200/s/t, X201/s/t, X220/t, X230/t&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>EC54 devices can use the EC34 variant, leaving only a small cosmetic gap to one side. EC34 devices cannot use the EC54 variant.</p>
<p><strong>What SSDs are compatible?</strong></p>
<p>Any M.2 2242 PCI-E based SSD. SATA drives are not supported. The current compatible list is as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Toshiba RC100 (up to 480GB)</li>
<li>Lexar NM520 (up to 512GB)</li>
<li>Sabrent Rocket 2242 (up to 2TB)</li>
<li>WD SN520 (up to 512GB)</li>
</ul>
<p>I recommend the Sabrent Rocket 2242, since it's incredibly fast, widely available, and goes up to 2TB. The WD SN520 is more widely available in Europe, though.</p>
<p><strong>What's the speed limit?</strong></p>
<p>The ExpressCard slot is limited to a single PCI-E 2.0 lane. This means the theoretical speed bottleneck is 425MB/s real-world, which is roughly the speed of SATA 6Gb/s (SATA 3).</p>
<p>Pre-Sandy Bridge models (T410/X201 and older) are limited to PCI-E 1.1, which is roughly 220MB/s. The P50/51/70/71 are capable of PCI-E 3.0, and can go up to ~900MB/s.</p>
<p><strong>Is it bootable?</strong></p>
<p>The adapter comes with a USB flash chip embedded inside, which can be booted from any stock BIOS. It contains the Clover bootloader, which has special NVMe drivers that can then boot your SSD. If you use Coreboot, you can boot directly to the SSD without touching Clover.</p>

Or maybe you want to feel more inspired at work. Either way, learning to start with WHY can be extremely valuable.</p><h3 id="the-golden-circle">The Golden Circle</h3><p>Simon created The Golden Circle, a simple framework that consists of 3 concentric layers: WHAT, HOW, and WHY.</p><figure><img src="https://www.fernandoamaral.org/content/images/2021/01/goldencircle.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://www.fernandoamaral.org/content/images/size/w600/2021/01/goldencircle.jpg 600w, https://www.fernandoamaral.org/content/images/size/w1000/2021/01/goldencircle.jpg 1000w, https://www.fernandoamaral.org/content/images/2021/01/goldencircle.jpg 1200w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@picoftasty?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText">Mae Mu</a> on <a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/s6S8IgEN6-4?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText">Unsplash</a></figcaption></figure><p><strong>WHAT</strong> - Every leader can articulate what they, and their company, do. Since it's so straightforward, that is where they usually start.</p><p><strong>HOW</strong> - Most leaders also explain how they do what they do. Their unique value proposition, differentiators, and values.</p><p><strong>WHY</strong> - Few leaders make an effort to communicate why they do what they do: What's their purpose? Why does the organization exist? And why should anyone care?</p><p>The real breakthrough is the direction in which to move in the Golden Circle. You have probably guessed it by now. &nbsp;<strong>You're supposed to start with the WHY and move outwards, to the HOW, and finally the WHAT.</strong></p><p>As Simon points out, Martin Luther King gave the <em>"I have a dream"</em> speech, not the <em>"I have a plan"</em> speech.</p><h3 id="start-with-why-within-your-team">Start with WHY within your team</h3><p>When you lead a team, your success depends on the team's ability to accomplish its mission. Creating the conditions for them to succeed should be your number one priority.</p><p>Some leaders might argue that telling people what to do is the shorter, more efficient path to success. They may think that teaching the team how to do their tasks is all that's left to do.</p><p>Well, that might be good enough when dealing with workers doing repetitive, pre-defined chores. However, it is certainly not the best way to manage a high-performing team when problem-solving and creativity are ingredients of their daily tasks.</p><p>Starting with WHY, and reminding it constantly, keeps everyone aligned on the purpose of the team. That will energize and empower each individual to be pro-active, make the right decisions, surpass roadblocks, and the team will move faster as a consequence.</p><p>Teams that start with WHY are also more likely to have a strong sense of purpose and experience less churn.</p><p>People who make a habit of applying this framework can inspire others and be inspired themselves. It applies in both directions. When in doubt, don't be afraid to ask WHY.</p><h3 id="start-with-why-in-marketing">Start with WHY in Marketing</h3><p><em>"People don't buy what you do. They buy why you do it."</em> - Simon repeats this so many times, it can get on your nerves.</p><p>He also claims that <em>"the goal is not to do business with people who need what you have, the goal is to do business with people who believe in what you believe."</em></p><p>Many authors reference Apple again and again to illustrate this point. Let's allow it one more time.</p><figure><img src="https://www.fernandoamaral.org/content/images/2021/01/thinkdifferent.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://www.fernandoamaral.org/content/images/size/w600/2021/01/thinkdifferent.jpg 600w, https://www.fernandoamaral.org/content/images/size/w1000/2021/01/thinkdifferent.jpg 1000w, https://www.fernandoamaral.org/content/images/2021/01/thinkdifferent.jpg 1100w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>Focusing on the WHAT and the HOW, Apple would sell computers like this:</p><blockquote><em>"We make great computers. They're user friendly, beautifully designed, and easy to use. Want to buy one?"</em></blockquote><p>Starting with WHY and then moving to HOW and WHAT, they would end up with something more along these lines:</p><blockquote><em>"With everything we do, we aim to challenge the status quo. We aim to think differently. Our products are user-friendly, beautifully designed, and easy to use. We just happen to make great computers. Want to buy one?"</em></blockquote><p>In this case, a decision is made emotionally first and then justified rationally. That's why Apple <em>fanboys</em> are often accused of buying inferior products at inflated prices, as long as they come from Cupertino. Whether that is true or an exaggeration, any brand would love to have such a dedicated following.</p><p>Simon states that this behavior is grounded in biology and the way our brain makes decisions. The outer circle (WHAT) corresponds to the neocortex, where rational thoughts and language are processed. The inner circles (HOW and WHY) relate to the limbic system, where our emotions take control.</p><p>A gut feeling, that kind of decision that we need to follow but have trouble explaining rationally, comes straight from the inner circles. If your marketing can tap into the emotions of your audience, amazing things can happen.</p><p>Remember: People don't buy what you do. They buy why you do it.</p><h3 id="start-with-the-ted-talk">Start with the TED Talk</h3><p>If you've made it this far, I recommend watching Simon himself presenting his ideas. The TED Talk amassed more than 50 million views and is well worth 18 minutes of your time.</p><figure><a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/simon_sinek_how_great_leaders_inspire_action"><div><p>How great leaders inspire action</p><p>Simon Sinek has a simple but powerful model for inspirational leadership -- starting with a golden circle and the question: “Why?” His examples include Apple, Martin Luther King Jr. and the Wright brothers ...</p><p><img src="https://pa.tedcdn.com/apple-touch-icon.png"><span>TED Talks</span></p></div><p><img src="https://pi.tedcdn.com/r/pe.tedcdn.com/images/ted/04916ee6e81065c8333e6546184af512eee37bbe_2880x1620.jpg?c=1050%2C550&amp;w=1050"></p></a></figure><p>At this point, you'll probably be considering whether to read the book or not.</p><p>Although I strongly identify with the notion of starting with WHY and I've applied it many times in my life since I've discovered it, I have to say that 256 pages around this simple concept are a stretch.</p><p>The book reiterates the same message ad nauseam, and I found myself repeating <em>"Ok... I got it, start with WHY!" in my head, </em>halfway through it.</p><figure><a href="https://simonsinek.com/product/start-with-why/"><div><p>Start With Why | Simon Sinek</p><p>In 2009, Simon Sinek started a movement to help people become more inspired at work, and in turn inspire their colleagues and customers.

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>I recently came across <a href="https://github.com/SerenityOS/serenity">SerenityOS</a> when it was featured in hxp CTF and then on <a href="https://twitter.com/liveoverflow">LiveOverflow’s</a> YouTube channel. SerenityOS is an open source operating system written from scratch by <a href="https://twitter.com/awesomekling">Andreas Kling</a> and now has a strong and active community behind it. If you’d like to learn a bit more about it then the recent <a href="https://cppcast.com/serenity-os/">CppCast episode</a> is a good place to start, as well as all of the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/andreaskling">fantastic videos by Andreas Kling</a>.</p>

<p>Two of the recent videos were about writing exploits for a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMvjaoBLPxA">typed array bug in javascript</a>, and a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gt6-TC6FtMs">kernel bug in munmap</a>. The videos were great to watch and got me thinking that it would be fun to try and find a couple of bugs that could be chained together to create a full chain exploit such as exploiting a browser bug to exploit a kernel bug to get root access.</p>

<h3 id="entrypoint">Entrypoint</h3>

<p>I started looking around and discovered an integer overflow when creating a typed array from an array buffer, the length was multiplied by the element size which could overflow.

<p>This could be used to create two powerful primitives, one that could read an arbitrary address and the other that could read an arbitrary amount from some allocated memory. These were the same primitives that Kling created in his video which meant that the issue could be exploited in exactly the same way:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Finding a vtable pointer with the offset primitive by spraying lots of Numbers</li>
  <li>Use the deterministic memory layout to calculating the stack location</li>
  <li>Find the saved return address on the stack</li>
  <li>Overwriting it with a rop chain.</li>
</ul>

<p>While I was looking into exploiting this, someone else spotted the same issue and it was quickly patched.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/SerenityOS/serenity/commit/f6c6047e49f1517778f5565681fb64750b14bf60"><img src="https://devcraft.io/assets/serenity/slack.jpg" alt="slack"></a></p>

<p>As I had already started and wanted to keep using the same issue, I kept working from <a href="https://github.com/SerenityOS/serenity/commit/c899ace3ad1efbf1bc8f8ee2ebb1e35903d7224b">this commit</a> which still had the bug :)</p>

<p>Exploiting the issue is pretty much identical to the video above and it does a great job explaining what is going on, so I wont go into too much detail. Here Is what I ended up with:</p>

<p>After loading this up and setting a breakpoint with gdb at <code>0x9d000000</code>:</p>

<p><img src="https://devcraft.io/assets/serenity/gef.jpg" alt="gef"></p>

<p>Success! Arbitrary code in the browser.</p>

<h3 id="kernel-bug-hunting">Kernel Bug Hunting</h3>

<p>Next it was time to try and find a kernel bug that could be reached from the browser process. There had been a few issues with integer overflows, so I started looking for places that this might happen. After some searching I saw the following in <a href="https://github.com/SerenityOS/serenity/blob/22b0ff05d4a5b087d805d8147ca12efe410cb18f/Kernel/VM/RangeAllocator.cpp#L139">RangeAllocator::allocate_anywhere</a>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>for</span> <span>(</span><span>size_t</span> <span>i</span> <span>=</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span> <span>i</span> <span>&lt;</span> <span>m_available_ranges</span><span>.</span><span>size</span><span>();</span> <span>++</span><span>i</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>auto</span><span>&amp;</span> <span>available_range</span> <span>=</span> <span>m_available_ranges</span><span>[</span><span>i</span><span>];</span>

    <span>// FIXME: This check is probably excluding some valid candidates when using a large alignment.</span>
    <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>available_range</span><span>.</span><span>size</span><span>()</span> <span>&lt;</span> <span>(</span><span>effective_size</span> <span>+</span> <span>alignment</span><span>))</span>
        <span>continue</span><span>;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Each process has a list of available ranges that are used when allocating memory regions. This code is looping through all the ranges and seeing if there is one large enough to hold the requested size, taking into account the alignment (both <code>effective_size</code> and <code>alignment</code> are controlled by the user). The issue is that <code>effective_size + alignment</code> can overflow, resulting in a range being chosen that is too small to hold the requested size.</p>

<p>The <code>available_range</code> is then used to create a new allocated range:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>    <span>FlatPtr</span> <span>initial_base</span> <span>=</span> <span>available_range</span><span>.</span><span>base</span><span>().</span><span>offset</span><span>(</span><span>offset_from_effective_base</span><span>).</span><span>get</span><span>();</span>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalable_Vector_Graphics">SVG</a>, short for <em>“scalable vector graphics”</em> is a format for, well, scalable vector graphics. In this article I summarize my opinion of the format, what its problems are and suggest what could be done to improve things.</p>
<p>I’ve been using SVG together with Inkscape regularly for a few years for sketches and graphics, and like to write it by hand to satisfy my love for precision and art through code. SVG and I have a kind of love-hate relationship. It’s powerful and has some nice free and open-source tooling, but the format itself is pretty ugly.</p>
<h2 id="the-good">The Good</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>It’s <em>the</em> format for vector graphics. It is well supported by a range of programs from Adobe Illustrator to Inkscape for editing and in various browsers.</p></li>
<li><p>It’s a web standard so you can use it directly in websites. You can also use CSS with it.</p></li>
<li><p>It’s XML-based, so the syntax is familiar, it’s extensible and can benefit from the vast XML ecosystem. For example, using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XLink">XLink</a> you can reference other elements and definitions in an SVG file. Or <a href="https://inkscape.org/">Inkscape</a> uses custom XML tags to extend SVG into their editor exchange format.</p></li>
<li><p>It’s powerful. You can do <em>a lot</em> with it. It obviously supports various path types and shapes, supports text and more, but also animations, gradients, effects and more.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="the-bad">The Bad</h2>
<p>It’s a web standard. And as is customary for a web standard, SVG is magnificiently bloated. The <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/SVG11/REC-SVG11-20110816.pdf">SVG specification</a> brings a whopping 826 (<em>eight-hundred twenty-six</em>) pages to the table. And as if that’s not enough, it’s also XML-based and cross-linked with other web standards, driving the scope of any implementation to dizzying heights.</p>
<p>If you want to be sure to correctly render all SVG files, not only do you have to consider 800 pages of SVG spec, but e.g.&nbsp;another 20 pages of <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/xlink11/">XLink spec</a>. Oh, and CSS as well, by the way. And, I shit you not, <em>JAVASCRIPT</em>. Yes. <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Element/script">SVG files can include <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tags.</a></p>
<p>SVG fits right in with web browsers. They’re hilariously bloated already, they already implement stuff like CSS and JavaScript that a complete SVG implementation requires. This problem of SVG is actually just the <a href="https://drewdevault.com/2020/03/18/Reckless-limitless-scope.html">problem of the web in general</a>. It’s scope is huge, it’s bloated and hard to work with.</p>
<p>SVG is nothing you could implement in a day. Or a week. Or a month. The huge amount of specifications, that are most often only partly implemented, makes it very hard to overview what supports what, confusing the user as to what features they can actually use if they want their SVG file to be universally supported.</p>
<p>Furthermore the XML-based syntax is pretty ugly and needlessly verbose. It’s tiring to write by hand and just as tiring to parse or generate automatically.</p>
<h2 id="the-ugly">The Ugly</h2>
<p>A central problem that can be extracted from the points listed above is the one I detailed in my article about <a href="https://www.eisfunke.com/article/language-design-machine-or-human.html">language design for machines vs.&nbsp;humans</a>: SVG doesn’t know what it wants to be, a machine-focused language or a human-focused language and ends up doing badly in both aspects.</p>
<p>Is it a machine-processible language? It’s far too bloated for that. Writing parsers, renderers and generators for SVGs is a huge task. The syntax is repetitive and complex. It has a lot of features that could be represented by more basic features.</p>
<p>But is it a format well-suited for direct usage by humans? Well, no. Firstly, the exhausting syntax and complexity is also bad for human users. Secondly, it misses a lot of features that would make it suitable for direct use. A graphics language that is meant for direct human use would be <a href="http://texdoc.net/pkg/tikz">Ti<em>k</em>Z</a> for LaTeX. While it’s not a great language regarding user experience in my opinion, it is definitely meant for humans and has the necessary features to help making creating complex graphics easy. But nobody would have the idea to use Ti<em>k</em>Z code as an interchange format for the finished graphic. Nobody would want to implement 1300 pages of Ti<em>k</em>Z manual just to view some graphic. Instead you compile it into an PDF (which is also a horrible format and badly bloated, but well). If SVG was a language meant for human use, compiling it into a machine-focused format would be the way to go as well, but as I said – it isn’t. It’s neither.</p>
<h2 id="what-now">What now?</h2>
<p>A good idea would be to develop a simple vector graphics exchange format that is desigend to be easily processed by machines. As minimal in features as possible. Maybe JSON-based, definitely not XML-based. You should be able to implement a basic renderer in a few days, or even better, hours, without depending on two metric tons of XML ecosystem libraries. Bezier curves, elliptic curves, fills, outlines and gradients should mostly suffice to represent every unanimated SVG. An extension could allow animations in a separate file extension.</p>
<p>This minimal and well-delimited format could then have a strict test suite and be implemented in browsers and image viewers with relative ease. Users could rely on their graphic working everywhere and implementers wouldn’t have to worry about implementing XLink, CSS and JavaScript as well. It could save bandwidth and computation power. Compilers from and to SVG could be written for compatibility.</p>
<p>It could be used as export format of user-facing programs like Inkscape or Adobe Illustrator. For people wanting to markup graphics through code there’s already stuff like Ti<em>k</em>Z, <a href="https://diagrams.github.io/">Haskell diagrams</a> or <a href="https://matplotlib.org/stable/index.html">Python matplotlib</a> that could also export to the new minimal interchange format.</p>
<p>I’m actually thinking about making a slim machine-focused vector graphics format (the name <em>“SlimSVG”</em> has been suggested :D) and writing my own human-focused Haskell graphics creation library with similar goals for my own purposes in the future, maybe as a student research project for the university.</p>
<p>In summary: Decide whether a language is for humans or for machines and do one of those things. And do the one thing well instead of both, but badly.</p>

<p><strong>Update 2:</strong> Somebody posted this on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/livw57/svg_the_good_the_bad_and_the_ugly">Reddit</a> as well. Currently, there are over 150 comments, wow.</p>
<p><strong>Update 3:</strong> PEOPLE, PLEASE. This is absolutely not about “XML is bad, let’s do JSON instead”. I actually like XML more than JSON in total, I’m a fan of XML schema and nice strong schemas. And while I still don’t like the syntax, XML generally is a good fit for a document markup language like HTML. I mostly wouldn’t care whether a good format with a good data model was encoded in JSON, XML, YAML, binary, Brainfuck or monkey feces. The encoding really is the least important part. I just think that for a strictly machine-focused format for data JSON would be a better choice.</p>
<p>I guess though I should have anticipated that saying that I don’t like XML and then mentioning the word “JSON” would start a religious war.</p>

                    <p>Wouldn’t it be amazing if you could sign up with a website with face recognition on your mobile phone and the next day on your MacBook you could just use your fingerprint scanner to sign in? What if we told you that this is possible today? </p><p>Currently you manage your accounts using passwords that you have to remember. For most users this is done by either remembering various different passwords, or worse; using the same one for every website. While social login has brought us a convenient way to sign in to websites using a single account, it still requires an account with a password. On top of that, there are security and privacy risks when using a single account for each service. Extra layers of security, like two factor authentication, can be added. But those come at the cost of complexity for the end user. The problem lies in passwords themselves. To solve it we should, and finally can, get rid of them all together to provide a user-friendly and secure authentication flow. </p><p>Even though it is still early and it has not landed in all browsers, we feel this is the future. We have already looked into what it takes to implement. As with any form of authentication, it is definitely not a trivial subject and it requires effort to implement. But please bear with us though, as we talk you through the steps. The result for the end user is definitely worth it.</p><p>Passwordless authentication on the web is made possible by the new Web Authentication (WebAuthn) API. If you’re not familiar with this API, you can check out <a href="https://webauthn.guide/#about-webauthn">this guide</a> or the video below to make it all a bit more tangible.</p><figure><iframe width="480" height="270" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hk7kDRx3MuQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><figcaption>The simplicity of using WebAuthn</figcaption></figure><h3 id="connecting-devices">Connecting devices</h3><p>The WebAuthn API supports replacing passwords with biometric data through device specific authenticators. These authenticators are, for example, the facial recognition &amp; fingerprint scanners built into (mobile) devices.</p><p>Creating accounts and logging in with a device-specific authenticator has one problem. The fingerprint scanner on a mobile phone isn’t connected to the one on a laptop. So, how does a user access their account on a laptop if they created the account on a mobile phone? </p><p>For multi-device passwordless authentication we created a proof-of-concept flow. Our solution uses a secure environment already shared on all devices: email. A secure link sent through email connects the laptop &amp; mobile phone. No typing required at all. Let’s explore this flow together.</p><h3 id="under-the-hood">Under the hood</h3><p>For most server side languages, there’s a library available that does the heavy lifting around WebAuthn by implementing FIDO2. We went with <a href="https://github.com/abergs/fido2-net-lib">abergs/fido2-net-lib</a> on .NET core. The juicy part is in expanding the user interaction flow. Let’s start with registration. </p><p>A user enters a desired username (a valid email in our case), presses the register button and is presented with a biometric confirmation modal to resolve a generated challenge that is sent by the server. When the user successfully authenticates with their biometric info, an account is created for that user.</p><p>During account creation, these steps are executed:</p><ol><li>Server sends challenge</li><li>Device requests biometric confirmation</li><li>User scans finger</li><li>Device creates public + private key</li><li>Device sends public key as response</li><li>Server creates user account associated to that public key</li></ol><p>When a user later wants to login to the website, they enter their username (email) again and then are presented with a biometric confirmation modal to resolve a generated challenge. This time the server checks if the response (that the browser generates based on the given challenge and private key) matches the user with the given email address. If that’s the case, the user is logged in.</p><p>During user login, these steps are executed:</p><ol><li>Server sends challenge</li><li>Device requests biometric confirmation</li><li>User scans finger</li><li>Device signs challenge with private key</li><li>Device sends response to server</li><li>Server verifies response with public key</li></ol><p>On a technical level this is not too different compared to a regular password login, if you would hash and salt the password before sending it over. The biggest difference is we’re not asking the user to authenticate with something that needs to be remembered.</p><h3 id="implementing-multi-device-sign-in">Implementing multi-device sign-in</h3><p>Logging in with a platform authenticator only works if the local device has credentials stored for this website. The first step in making multi-device possible is by detecting if the device has credentials for the current website user account or not. If it doesn’t, the Web Authentication API will throw an error. This allows us to ask the user if they want to add this device to their account.</p><figure><pre><code>let credentials;
try {
  credentials = await navigator.credentials.get(optionsObject);
} catch (err) {
  // Show modal to ask if the user wants to add this device to their account
  confirmAddDevice();
}</code></pre><figcaption>Detect if the device platform authenticator has known credentials</figcaption></figure><p>This is the hook that allows us to extend the user experience. For our take on a possible UX flow for passwordless multi-device authentication we came up with the diagram below. Highlighted in blue is the email confirmation flow that we found missing in existing implementations of logging in without a password. Remember that, while this diagram may seem daunting at first, all the parts in black are taken care of by WebAuthn and the FIDO2 library. Luckily that also is the hardest and most boring part.</p><figure><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/vwtyGrDkcChPhUrxucOV-6IbyzezykWKK-NI_KEF4px3Ke-uGunrfKZXd34gd0z5R0tfd1-xEiidbgTCVbKK09qdhKiW6ezDYaUg_keR61DoGJmJR1Xs4vXokVCnSzWAD2fSwFFG"><figcaption>Expand the platform authenticator flow to support multiple devices</figcaption></figure><p>Our flow starts when the user wants to sign in to their existing account from an unknown device. The flow starts similar to the regular login flow. However, we can now detect when the device has no credentials stored for this website.</p><p>Interaction wise this is where things get interesting. We can let the user know that this is an unknown account that is being attempted to sign in to. But just showing an error is a dead path. A user expects an immediate follow-up action to add this device to the account.</p><p>In our case we show a modal to ask the user if they want to add the new device:</p><figure><pre><code>async function confirmAddDevice() {
  const confirm = confirm('Do you want to add this device to your account?');
  if (!confirm) {
    // User denied the confirm modal, do nothing
    return;
  }

  try {
    await fetch('/api/add-device', {
      method: 'POST',
      body: {
        email: this.email
      }
    });

    alert('Email sent, click the link in the mail to continue the process.')
  } catch {
    alert('Could not send an email, please try again later.')
  }
}</code></pre><figcaption>Ask the user if they want to add the device to their account</figcaption></figure><p>When the user confirms the action, the client sends a request to the server. Luckily we know how to securely contact the user because they registered with their email as username. The server then sends an email that allows the user to register their device.</p><figure><pre><code>[HttpPost]
[Route("/add-device")]
public async Task&lt;JsonResult&gt; AddDevice([FromBody] string email)
{
  var user = Storage.GetUser(email);
  if(user == null) {
    return NotFound();
  }

  var otp = Storage.GenerateAndStoreOneTimePasswordForUser(user);

  var response = await SendAddDeviceEmail(user, otp);
  return Json(response);
}</code></pre><figcaption>Send an email to the user</figcaption></figure><p>By clicking the link in the email, the user confirms this device may be added to their account. The flow is just like with the first device, only adding a one time password (OTP) in the form of a link in an email. The OTP allows the new device to be securely linked to the existing account. This is done by the server, which checks if the OTP matches the one generated for the user, and stores the challenge response as an additional device linked to the account.</p><p>This way, minimal user input is required to allow multi-device passwordless authentication on the web. On top of that, we leverage existing patterns for account validation (through email) that users are already used to on the web.</p><h3 id="outro">Outro</h3><p>We are very excited to work towards a more secure and effortless web, and can’t wait to use this in production. What’s your opinion on passwordless authentication, and how should multi-device usage be addressed? We would love to hear your ideas and get to know your implementations.</p><hr><p><em>Do you love figuring out new features like multi-device passwordless authentication?

    <div id="post-body">
        <p>&lt;rant&gt;Two years ago I sat in on a security meeting. The subject was protecting the code and associated websites from attack.</p><p>"I'd just attack the npm packaging system, introducing subtle changes in several that would work together to do whatever I wanted."</p><p>All I got was blank stares, and this was from professionals. From <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/researcher-hacks-over-35-tech-firms-in-novel-supply-chain-attack">this week's reading</a>:</p><blockquote>Unlike <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/malicious-npm-project-steals-discord-accounts-browser-info/">traditional typosquatting attacks</a> that rely on social engineering tactics or the victim misspelling a package name, this particular supply chain attack is more sophisticated as it needed no action by the victim, who automatically received the malicious packages.<p>This is because the attack leveraged a unique design flaw of the open-source ecosystems called <strong>dependency confusion.</strong></p></blockquote><p>Even using things like Test-Driven Development, programmers can only reason about a small part of the code in front of him in the IDE. (In fact, one of the reasons TDD is so successful is because programmers have no idea at how much they suck at actually understanding what they're doing).</p><p>From a recent study:</p><figure><img src="https://danielbmarkham.com/content/images/2021/02/EsXlJyCXYAAD9x7.png" alt="" srcset="https://danielbmarkham.com/content/images/size/w600/2021/02/EsXlJyCXYAAD9x7.png 600w, https://danielbmarkham.com/content/images/size/w1000/2021/02/EsXlJyCXYAAD9x7.png 1000w, https://danielbmarkham.com/content/images/size/w1600/2021/02/EsXlJyCXYAAD9x7.png 1600w, https://danielbmarkham.com/content/images/2021/02/EsXlJyCXYAAD9x7.png 1890w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>Here's the takeaway graphic:</p><figure><img src="https://danielbmarkham.com/content/images/2021/02/2021-02-11_9-41-46.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://danielbmarkham.com/content/images/size/w600/2021/02/2021-02-11_9-41-46.jpg 600w, https://danielbmarkham.com/content/images/2021/02/2021-02-11_9-41-46.jpg 678w"></figure><p>Note: this result is seeking out a mean, regular coders writing regular code. Your mileage may vary.</p><p>Why is this? Let's take two code samples:</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><pre><code>echo Hello World
</code></pre>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><pre><code>#include &lt;cstdio&gt;

int main()
{
    printf("hello from %s!\n", "HelloWorld");
    return 0;
}
</code></pre>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>In the first example, how many symbols is the programmer manipulating to reach their goal? Only one, "echo" In the second example, how many symbols are being manipulated?</p><p>I counted seven, but I wasn't trying to be strict.</p><p>What do these seven involve? There's namespaces, libraries, standard function signatures, string substitution, OS return values, and so on.</p><p>Do any of these matter to the new C# programmer? Of course not! That's why it's called "Hello World". You're supposed to be able to type in a few symbols and start doing something useful right away.</p><p>The waters get murky very quickly after that. Let's say your boss sends you an email:</p><p>"Jenkins, add the cover sheet to all of those TPS reports"</p><p>Something goes wrong. The boss is unhappy. You two have a conversation about what you did that was mistaken.</p><p>Suppose instead you're looking at the following code:</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><pre><code>WorkingStack.Reports.AddSheet(cover);
</code></pre>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>The boss is mad because it's not working right.</p><p>You can certainly go into the boss's office and have that same conversation, just this time over code instead of an email. <em>In fact, that's what you have to do</em>. Without a bunch more source code, what the hell does that C# code do, anyway? You don't know. It says it does the same thing as the boss wanted, but for all you know it's mailing off your tax returns to Russian hackers.</p><p>Most of modern programming is spent creating and consuming fake abstractions that are much more leaky and buggy than we'd like admit. In fact, it's grown far, far beyond our ability to reason about. It's magic. We spend a lot of time pretending that this isn't the case, then cursing when reality rears its ugly head again.</p><p>When I was writing <a href="https://leanpub.com/info-ops2">my second book</a>, I had to address this problem because reasoning about code and controlling complexity is the number one problem in software development today. It's the reason we have buildings full of hundreds of developers wasting a lot of time and money. Our incentives are wrong.</p><p>The best thing to look for in any professional, doctor, lawyer, coder, etc is their ability to not engage with a problem, instead solving it in a simple and non-intrusive way. The worst behavior from professionals are the folks who are going to do a lot of work no matter what. These guys look busy, and they’re deep in a bunch of technically wonky stuff that nobody understands, so naturally they look like they know what they’re doing and are doing a good job. The guy who shows up in flip-flops and after a five-minute conversation solves your problem? He’s just some smart eleck showman, probably a con man.</p><p>We don’t teach coders the one skill they need most of all: adding incremental complexity as-needed. Nobody talks about choosing what to add and why. Nobody talks about ways to understand you’ve gone too far (except for a few folks like me. Apologies for the shameless plug.)</p><p>For some odd reason, discussions on frameworks and complexity always devolve into some version of “Dang kids!” vs. “Talentless luddite!” As many people have pointed out, not only do we not teach or talk about incremental complexity, if you don’t have the appropriate buzzwords in your CV, you don’t get hired. So BigCorps naturally end up with scads of people who did well on scads of tech that somebody decide they had to use/learn but nobody very good at actually making things happen.</p><p>This can't continue, and I want to do my part in making it end. The answer I came up is something I call it <strong>Code Cognitive Load (CCL)</strong>. It's the amount of risk you take on as a programmer looking at any piece of code to manipulate it, whether coding fresh or doing maintenance on existing code.</p><ol><li>It's scoped first by method/function and then by compilation unit. There's no other scoping (namespace, class, module, etc.)</li><li>To compute, you add up four things: symbols you are required to look at to do your work, exceptions that using those symbols may throw, &nbsp;any editable code underneath that you may have to read or write for those symbols to work, and exceptions that code may throw</li></ol><p>You can see for the first Hello World example, there's only one symbol, echo, and there's only one general type of exception, and that's related to system resources. For the second example, the count easily goes into the dozens.</p><p>Why is this related to the security problem I led off with? Because if you have code you can't reason about, you don't just have a risk for bugs, it's a security risk too. The code doesn't care whether it's busy screwing up your beautiful solution or hacking your local network. You can't reason about it. Period. That's the problem. It's doing whatever it's coded to do.</p><p>Do npm packages count as "editable code underneath that I have to read or write for these symbols to work"? Sure, if you're downloading code and compiling it, you may have to edit it. It's a risk. If you're just hotlinking to a dll or something, that's different. If you're using precompiled code, whatever you've got, you've got. It may be buggy as hell and it may do nasty things that make you sad and drink by yourself late at night, but it's not a complexity issue, it's some other kind of issue, security, performance, and so on. Don't confuse them. You address and work with the problems of that precompiled library in a totally different way than you would with code you may one day have to plow through.</p><p>Code Cogntivie Load (CCL) is not a good/bad metric. It's a measure of the risk in complexity you're assuming to do whatever work you have to do. Some problems may naturally require a great deal of complexity risk. Others not so much. That's your call, not mine.</p><p>The point is that you're measuring it, instead of just ignoring it until something goes wrong. Is your solution doing mostly the same thing but your CCL is going through the roof? You're most likely doing something wrong, since your code's value is staying the same while your coding risk is dramatically increasing. </p><p>There's no way of knowing whether code is appropriately complex or not, but we can (and should) measure how much <em>complexity risk</em> we're taking on ourselves and our downstream maintenance workers.</p><p>This will change the way you code and the way you think about coding. Good. Looking at the software landscape today, things need changing.</p><p>&lt;/rant&gt;</p>    </div>

                    <p>On December 1st, 2020, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/opensource/want-more-postgresql-you-just-might-like-babelfish/">Amazon AWS announced Babelfish</a>. Babelfish “<em>adds an endpoint to PostgreSQL that understands the SQL Server wire protocol Tabular Data Stream (TDS), as well as commonly used T-SQL commands used by SQL Server. Support for T-SQL includes elements such as the SQL dialect, cursors, catalog views, data types, triggers, stored procedures, and functions</em>”. Wow. <strong>SQL Server wire and application compatibility for PostgreSQL!</strong></p>
<p>What this means is that Babelfish will be able to “impersonate” a SQL Server database. Applications may be able to run unchanged, believing that they are connecting to SQL Server, when they will actually be connecting to PostgreSQL-Babelfish.</p>
<p>Surely, compatibility will not be 100% at the beginning. But it will keep improving, and <strong>as long as it provides enough compatibility for a nice set of applications to run unchanged on Babelfish, it will open the door to migrations and replacing SQL Servers with Babelfish</strong>. This is very good news for the PostgreSQL Community!</p>
<h2 id="brief-analysis-on-postgresql-popularity">Brief analysis on PostgreSQL popularity</h2>
<p><a href="https://db-engines.com/en/blog_post/85">PostgreSQL has been named (again) database of the year 2020</a>. This award is given based on “<em>DBMSs sorted by how much they managed to increase their popularity in 2020</em>”, which means that <strong>PostgreSQL was the database that grew the most in popularity in 2020</strong>. <strong>But in absolute terms, PostgreSQL’s popularity is still way behind that of Oracle, MySQL and SQL Server</strong>. Let’s analyze <a href="https://db-engines.com/en/ranking_trend">db-engines popularity trend chart</a> for the Top4 DBMS, on a linear scale (db-engines presents results on a logarithmic scale):</p>
<p><img src="https://postgresql.fund/img/dbengines_popularity_ranking-linear-900.png" alt="DB-engines popularity ranking - linear scale"></p>
<p>The trends for the last 8 years are clear: Oracle and SQL Server are constantly declining in popularity; MySQL is slightly declining; and PostgreSQL is clearly growing in popularity. But while PostgreSQL almost tripled in popularity in these eight years, it is still far behind the other three.</p>
<p>PostgreSQL became the database of 2020 because its popularity grew the most in the last year. The other three mentioned databases declined in popularity during 2020. If we assume the same rate of change in popularity will continue for the upcoming years, by 2025 PostgreSQL would still remain in the 4th place, albeit close to SQL Server. It won’t overtake SQL Server until 2026, and by 2030 PostgreSQL would still lag behind Oracle and MySQL.</p>

<p>How is this analysis related to Babelfish? <strong>Babelfish opens the door to new users, new markets, new opportunities. <strong>Babelfish may bump PostgreSQL’s popularity further, targeting use cases that either PostgreSQL is not able to reach today; or can only reach via complex technology migrations.</strong> Babelfish could be one of the many potential boosts that PostgreSQL needs in order to become a more universally used database</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="to-fork-or-not-to-fork-thats-the-question">To fork, or not to fork, that’s the question</h2>
<p>In their announcement, AWS said that “<em>We are open sourcing Babelfish in 2021. […] We are releasing Babelfish under the Apache 2.0 license. We invite others to become active in the project, and we will see it as a sign of success when developers outside of AWS become committers or maintainers. You can help by adding or extending Babelfish functionality, submitting feature requests, working on documentation, and contributing test cases</em>”. They also mentioned the code will be published on GitHub.</p>
<p><strong>At the time Babelfish will be published, it will likely require changes to PostgreSQL to enable Babelfish to be an extension</strong>. Some people may call that a “fork” of PostgreSQL, and others may call it a “development branch”. The difference between the two will only be clear over time. Note that PostgreSQL development model doesn’t use feature branches, and in my opinion it’s a great model –but this is an entirely different topic. It is really appreciated that AWS is releasing the code as open source, and under a permissive license (that should be compatible with PostgreSQL’s). <strong>If AWS developers work with the PostgreSQL Community to get the necessary changes merged into PostgreSQL core, then it would have been a development branch, and not a fork. This is something that the PostgreSQL Community and all parties involved need to figure out</strong>.</p>
<p>On January 25th, Amazon AWS made a first move. In an <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/message-id/CAGBW59d5SjLyJLt-jwNv%2BoP6esbD8SCB%3D%3D%3D11WVe5%3DdOHLQ5wQ%40mail.gmail.com">email to PostgreSQL’s hackers mailing list</a>, Jan Wieck, a well-known Postgres-er, proposed to start discussing the implementation of protocol hooks. These hooks would enable to implement SQL Server’s protocol as an extension, rather than a fork.</p>
<p>Protocol hooks are, possibly, not the only hooks or modifications to PostgreSQL core that would be required to integrate the whole Babelfish project. With those changes to the core most of the Babelfish code could possibly be integrated in core as an extension(s). I cannot estimate the complexity of these core changes. But I believe that it would be a worthwhile effort, an effort that may further increase PostgreSQL outreach.</p>
<p>Only very recently (Feb 10th, 11th) some initial, very interesting, discussion around this proposal has started (including a very interesting offer to <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/message-id/CADUqk8UndFi7WHVNZscs4ZCk37_2aBUw-K32QA7sQd_3cJ%2Bqng%40mail.gmail.com">open source MySQL protocol compatibility for Postgres!</a>). It’s understandable, it’s a very busy time for PostgreSQL hackers (the last Commitfest for feature inclusion into PostgreSQL 14 is ongoing). But Babelfish was already announced more than two months ago; and it could be published anytime. I believe we need to start a deeper conversation about Postgres-Babelfish integration sooner than later. And what is being discussed so far are mainly technical considerations around the integration of one of the possibly several integration points that may be required. <strong>I’d love to also have a strategic discussion, where the Community would address, from a leadership perspective, what would be the plans for integrating, or not, Babelfish</strong>. <strong>Is Babelfish the Elephant in the Room?</strong> Probably not anymore, but I anyway hope this post will help, at the very least, to spark the strategic discussion.</p>
<p>What is the alternative? What will happen if PostgreSQL would not implement such hooks or will not pursue understanding with AWS, for the common benefit, and help Babelfish and PostgreSQL cooperate and allow for code bases integration?</p>
<p><strong>Under this scenario, AWS will probably have to keep Babelfish as a fork</strong>. For one, AWS already keeps Aurora as a fork, even though it’s an internal one. Given AWS’ well-known customer obsession and that AWS doesn’t kill services that they started offering, I think that if given no other chance they will keep Babelfish as a separate fork, getting its own share of features and contributors. Surely AWS knows that maintaining a fork is expensive. And I believe they have no intention to have it as a fork (otherwise, they won’t be publishing it as open source). So there will be serious intentions and efforts to merge it into PostgreSQL, for the benefit of all. But the recent Elastic case has demonstrated that AWS is committed to the open source software that is part of their managed services, and are willing to step up with a lot of resources when they are required to continue serving their customers. Apparently AWS has around 200 open job positions (!!) for developers working on Elasticsearch. Surely they can do the same for Babelfish, especially given that RDS Postgres/Aurora/Babelfish is probably a much larger business for them than Elastic.</p>
<h2 id="on-protocol-hooks">On protocol hooks</h2>
<p>Jan also argued that “<em>Creating the necessary infrastructure in the postmaster and backend will open up more possibilities, that are not tied to our compatibility efforts. Possible use cases for wire protocol extensibility include the development of a completely new, not backwards compatible PostgreSQL protocol or extending the existing wire protocol</em>”. I cannot agree more. This effort not only benefits the Babelfish integration; but also opens the door for new PostgreSQL protocols.</p>
<p>The current PostgreSQL protocol (v3) <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/7.4/release-7-4.html">has been in use since PostgreSQL 7.4</a>, released in 2003. It works well, and has spun the broadest possible set of drivers, tools and even compatible databases that use it (like CockroachDB, Crate.io or NoisePage, for example). But it also has some limitations and well-known problems. There is an entry in PostgreSQL “TODO” about <a href="https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/Todo#Wire_Protocol_Changes_.2F_v4_Protocol">proposed changes for an eventual v4 version of the protocol</a>. I also participated in another <a href="https://github.com/pgjdbc/pgjdbc/blob/95ba7b261e39754674c5817695ae5ebf9a341fae/backend_protocol_v4_wanted_features.md">“brain dump” on v4 proposed features</a>. But despite much talk, v4 has not happened and there’s no ongoing effort to make it happen. v3 is to stay for long.</p>
<p>Why is that, why can’t the protocol evolve? Have a look at <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/message-id/CD5C1525-8B2C-4986-87F0-B1CB3B52ACA7%40wa-research.ch">this thread</a>, where a proposal to implement an HTTP protocol for PostgreSQL was made. Other than the proposal about HTTP itself –which has its own merits, and is a topic that I believe should definitely be discussed again–, the general sentiment was that <strong>any new protocol would have to provide all the features that the current protocol has, work for every use case, do not disrupt existing drivers or provide good means for driver rewrites; and do it significantly better than the current one</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="the-innovators-dilemma">The Innovator’s Dilemma</h2>
<p>I don’t have an MBA, but this to me is a clear case of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Innovator%27s_Dilemma">The Innovator’s Dilemma</a>. PostgreSQL protocol v3 is the incumbent, and protocol v4 and/or other protocols like HTTP are the potential disruptive innovators. In what looks like a perfect match for Christensen’s book, a disruptive protocol innovation “<em>would not initially satisfy the demands of even the high end of the market</em>”. In other words, initial versions of these protocols should not target feature parity with the incumbent. They should rather focus on doing the basics, but much better, with a compelling higher value proposition.</p>
<p>Eventually, these protocols “<em>will surpass sustaining technologies</em>” and may end up replacing the current v3 protocol. This was very well explained by Prof. Clayton and is represented on his famous graph comparing the product …</p></div></div></div></div></section></div>

<p>This article is my attempt to summarise common technical interview process steps and to collect in one place some useful insights from recruiters that they normally send to applicants before the interviews. This is not a comprehensive guide of the interview process and the actual interview steps may vary from company to company.</p>

<p>The common technical interview process consists of three main steps:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Phone interview with recruiter</strong> when you’ll be ask to tell about your experience and explain your motivation.</li>
<li><strong>Technical phone interview</strong> where you’ll be asked to solve some tech problems in real time.</li>
<li><strong>On-site (in-person) interview</strong> in company’s office when you’ll be asked to solve technical and system design problems as well as to answer some behavioural questions.</li>

<p>All interview steps are mainly consists of three following building blocks:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Problem solving.</strong> The main focus here is your ability to solve technical problems by applying different algorithmic approaches and data structures.</li>
<li><strong>System design.</strong> This one is about your ability to combine many pieces (frameworks, approaches, databases, micro-services) and design a system as a whole that will successfully solve certain tasks.</li>
<li><strong>Behavioural questions</strong> that are focused on your experience, motivations, leadership and soft skills.</li>
</ol>
<p>Let’s move on and touch every of these 6 aspects of the interview process.</p>

<p>Recruiter will introduce himself and give you more details about the company and projects you might be working on. You’ll be asked to introduce you and explain what was your responsibility on the previous projects.</p>
<p>Normally only things you did during the last 1–3 years matters. So focus on your latest achievements and responsibilities.</p>
<p>Introduce your side-projects, open-source projects and production projects from your latest workplace.</p>
<p>It will be done by means of telephone.</p>
<p>Things to remember:</p>
<ul>
<li>Get familiar with the job description and prepare your questions regarding the job.</li>
<li>Prepare a short introduction of yourself in the context of your profile, professional past, qualifications and education.</li>
<li>Use specific examples. The strongest examples are work based examples, but you can also use study or personal examples.</li>
<li>If you haven’t understood the interviewer’s question, ask them to repeat it or explain it further.</li>
<li>Learn about the company, be passioned about the company’s product (about what company is doing).</li>
<li>Feel free to ask any questions you have about the role or company in general.</li>
</ul>
<p>Explain yours experience examples in a clear manner. Using the STAR technique will help you:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>SITUATION/TASK</em> — Describe the situation/task you faced and the context of the story.</li>
<li><em>ACTION</em> — What actions did you take?</li>
<li><em>RESULTS</em> — How did you measure success for this project? What results did you achieve?</li>

<p>During the phone interview you’ll have a coding exercise (or task to develop something online).</p>
<p>The call will be 45–60 minutes long.</p>
<p>Some interviews will include 2 people. Don’t worry — one will be there purely for training purposes.</p>
<p>You will need access to a webcam. Wired internet and headphones are recommended but not essential. Your computer may require a plug-in install, so make sure you test the link that will be provided to you by recruiter with enough time before your call. Make sure to take the call in a calm environment.</p>
<p>You might be asked to install and/or use special programs and service like:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/chime/">Amazon Chime</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.bluejeans.com/">BlueJeans</a></li>

<li><a href="https://www.skype.com/en/">Skype</a></li>
<li><a href="https://coderpad.io/">CoderPad</a> or others</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What to expect during the interview:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>45 mins initial interview with 1–2 coding questions using a whiteboard (if on site) or laptop and a service similar to CoderPad (if remote).</li>
<li>You will be tested on your problem solving and core CS fundamental skills (theory, algorithms, data structures, design patterns, recursions, binary tree questions, Fibonacci series etc.)</li>
<li>You will need to think of an efficient, optimised and bug-free solution to code up quickly and concisely in whatever language you code best in.</li>
<li>Keep it simple! If you think it’s obvious, it probably is. Start with a simple solution, and think about making it more efficient afterwards.</li>

<p>For the on-site, you generally have 4 to 5 interviews — at least 2 strictly focused on coding, 1 on design, and 1 on conversation/coding. So basically all three building blocks described at the beginning of the chapter will be included.</p>
<p>There will be a 45-minute lunch to break up your day — the lunch will most likely be with one of the engineers. Feel free to be very candid with the engineer — they will not be providing feedback, but are there to answer any questions/concerns you may not have asked during your interview.</p>

<p><strong>General tips:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Explain</strong> — Interviewers want to understand how you think, so explain your thought process and decision making throughout the interview. Remember they are not only evaluating your technical ability, but also how you solve problems. Explicitly state and check assumptions with your interviewer to ensure they are reasonable.</li>
<li><strong>​Clarify</strong> — Many questions will be deliberately open-ended to provide insight into what categories and information you value within the technological puzzle. Interviewers are looking to see how you engage with the problem and your primary method for solving it. Be sure to talk
through your thought process and feel free to ask specific questions if you need clarification.</li>
<li><strong>Improve</strong> — Think about ways to improve the solution you present. It’s worthwhile to think out loud about your initial thoughts to a question. In many cases, your first answer may need some refining and further explanation. If necessary, start with the brute force solution and improve
on it — just let the interviewer know that’s what you’re doing and why.</li>
<li><strong>Practice</strong> — You won’t have access to an IDE or compiler during the interview so practice writing code on paper or a whiteboard. Be sure to test your code and ensure it’s easily readable without bugs. Don’t stress about small syntactical errors like which substring to use for a given method (e.g. start, end or start, length) — just pick one and let your interviewer know.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="before-the-interview">Before the interview<a href="#before-the-interview" aria-label="before the interview permalink"></a></h3>
<p><strong>Practice! Practice! Practice!</strong></p>
<p>Put yourself under time constraints as speed is important in the interview.</p>
<p><strong>Problems examples:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Write the code to print the first element of each “row” of a binary tree.</li>
<li>Implement tic-tac-toe.</li>
<li>Write the code to show the number and type of permutations of a given string.</li>
</ul>

</ul>
<p>You might also want to read <a href="http://www.crackingthecodinginterview.com/">Cracking the coding interview book</a> that will help you to prepare for coding interviews similar to what you will be solving throughout the interview process.</p>
<p><strong>Topics to cover:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Coding</strong> — You should know at least one programming language really well, preferably C++, Java, Python, JavaScript, Go, or C. You will be expected to know APIs, Object Oriented Design and Programming, how to test your code, as well as come up with corner cases and edge cases for code. Note that interviewers will focus on conceptual understanding rather than memorisation.</li>
<li><strong>Algorithms</strong> — Approach the problem with both bottom-up and top-down algorithms. You will be expected to know the complexity of an algorithm and how you can improve/change it. Algorithms that are used to solve problems include sorting (plus searching and binary search), divide-and-conquer, dynamic programming/memoization, greediness, recursion or algorithms linked to a specific data structure. Know Big-O notations (e.g. run time) and be ready to discuss complex algorithms like Dijkstra and A*. Knowing the runtimes, theoretical limitations, and basic implementation strategies of different classes of algorithms is more important than memorising the specific details of any given algorithm.</li>
<li><strong>Sorting</strong> — Be familiar with common sorting functions and on what kind of input data they’re efficient on or not. Think about efficiency means in terms of runtime and space used. For example, in exceptional cases insertion-sort or radix-sort are much better than the generic QuickSort/MergeSort/HeapSort answers.</li>
<li><strong>Data structures</strong> — You should study up on as many data structures as possible. Data structures most frequently used are arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, hash-sets, hash-maps, hash-tables, dictionary, trees and binary trees, heaps and graphs. You should know the data structure inside out, and what algorithms tend to go along with each data structure.</li>
<li><strong>Mathematics</strong> — Some interviewers ask basic discrete math questions. Spend some time before the interview refreshing your memory on (or teaching yourself) the essentials of elementary probability theory and combinatorics. You should be familiar with n-choose-k problems and their ilk.</li>
<li><strong>Graphs</strong> — Consider if a problem can be applied with graph algorithms like distance, search, connectivity, cycle-detection, etc. There are three basic ways to represent a graph in memory (objects and pointers, matrix, and adjacency list) — familiarize yourself with each representation and its pros and cons. You should know the basic graph traversal algorithms, breadth-first search and depth-first search. Know their computational complexity, their tradeoffs …</li></ul></div></div>

<p>
Much has been written about what makes for good design. All of it is fiercely debated by designers, who would rather find ways to exclude one another than celebrate commonality.
</p>
<p>
Rather than write yet another forgettable entry into the insufferable oeuvre of <i>This-Not-That</i>, I thought I’d just cut to the chase and focus on the <i>Not-That</i>.
</p>
<p>
Here are seven kinds of bad design. There are certainly more.
</p>
<h2>
Design made in ignorance of the damage it does is not good design.
</h2>
<p>
In 2021 we have enough information readily available to exhaustively vet ideas, measure costs, run scenarios, and project outcomes. We frequently choose to skip over most of these activities because they take time and cost money. But I suspect that the more salient reason we skip them is because testing an <i>idea</i> is too risky to the <i>ideologue</i>.
</p>
<p>
Entire systems of business are constructed to protect the idea-havers from the idea-deliverers — to insulate them from the questions and concerns that those most acquainted with how things work and how people use them have as soon as they receive their orders.
</p>
<p>
Insulation is the enemy of empathy. If you can’t access the impact of your ideas, then you will never understand the damage they can do. But that makes you no less responsible. There is no plausible deniability in good design.
</p>
<h2>
Design that takes inequalities for granted is not good design.
</h2>
<p>
Many of the products being made now that are the most nutritious, least processed, least harmful to the environment, least reliant upon the exploitation of others, and offer the most self-sufficiency to consumers are also the most expensive. The wealthy can afford them, and they live healthier and more comfortable lives as a result. They stay wealthy.
</p>
<p>
The products that are the most mass-produceable, widely available, and least expensive are those that are made from materials of lower quality, by workers with fewer rights, under poorer conditions, and for less pay. The poor can afford them, but they pay the difference in infirmity. They stay poor.
</p>
<p>
In a capitalist system, leading-edge products always start out more expensive. As they become more accepted and integrated in society, they can be produced at a lower price and be made available to more people. We want to believe that through this system, a certain standard of living can eventually be reached by all. One must wonder why that hasn’t happened yet.
</p>
<p>
Also in a capitalist system, what first succeeds is what the wealthy want. And yet, one evergreen desire of the wealthy is to <i>remain</i> wealthy. Wealth itself is a slippery concept; it means abundance and prosperity. While that could be interpreted to mean having more than one needs, it’s often taken as a comparison — to have more than <i>someone else</i>.
</p>
<p>
If you make something that widens the gap between those who already have a lot and those that never had much, you have not done good design.
</p>
<h2>
Design with short-term goals that can only exist by ignoring long-term effects is not good design.
</h2>
<p>
Planned obsolescence robs from the future to pay for the present. Why do we accept that modern devices are made with such lopsided priorities — thinness over battery life, beauty over resilience — which ensure our experience of them is one of rapidly diminishing returns? Why do buy the next thing sooner than our current one was promised to last? How many times must we do that before we realize the con?
</p>
<p>
Our own use cases are both hardly the problem and also the cause of everything. We pay too much and too often for things that could last longer. It’s wasteful and yet very on-brand for America. But how long must the acres of e-waste in Africa burn before we insist that our technology last a just little longer? Not just for our sake, but for those who barely eke out a living scavenging the toxic ash for resealable scrap. With growing evidence of the catastrophic environmental and human costs of digital devices — more on ecology in a moment — making temporary objects for perpetual users is deeply cruel.
</p>
<p>
If you make something to last only as long as the development phase for the next thing, you have not done good design.
</p>
<h2>
Design that ignores available data is not good design.
</h2>
<p>
Data show that cigarettes are addictive and eventually kill. Cigarette makers knew this decades before most everyone else and hid the data so that it would remain easy for them to sell their poison. Thus, there is no such thing as good design of a cigarette, its packaging, or any other accoutrement of its brand. Anything that makes it easier or more likely that anyone purchase or smoke a cigarette is bad. It may be good that one is free to smoke, but that doesn’t make smoking good for anyone.
</p>
<p>
Cigarettes, of course, are too easy a target. Many other things with much more sterling reputations are presently harmful to people. The data are persuasive of that yet, somehow, not persuasive enough to stop people from making or using these things. Some of them aren’t <i>things</i> at all, nor are they as easily avoided as a cigarette. Some of them are services that are so enmeshed in our social fabric that to avoid them can cost a person valuable relationships and opportunities. But when it is shown that these things manipulate people, make them less happy, distort the truth, spread lies, disrupt democracy, increase hate speech and violence, and generally make people less safe — when data has been gathered and disseminated to clearly show each of these effects — there is no good design of such a thing.
</p>
<p>
And if you make something that worsens available data, you have not done good design. You’ve participated in destruction.
</p>
<h2>
Design that produces something easily thrown away but not easily salvaged is not good design.
</h2>
<p>
It may be cheaper to make things out of older, established materials using older, established production processes and facilities than it is to use something new. But if that old stuff and those old ways aren’t as good for the world, how much longer does that calculation favor anyone?
</p>
<p>
How many more years do we have to churn out styrofoam? How many more years do we have to pretend to recycle plastic? How many more one-time use containers will we make? How strange it is that we willingly make things to be used for mere moments and then to rot exponentially longer in the same soil from which we draw food. That plastic cup you drank from for 15 minutes will take 450 years to break down. And when it does, it’s actually still there. It just doesn’t look like a cup anymore. But every single chemical molecule remains, in the soil, in the water, in the plants, in the animals that ate them, in us.
</p>
<p>
There are better materials out there that are less harmful to produce and easier to re-use, but getting them to the same scale of production we’ve been used to will require investment and patience. A short-term cost of transitioning to better materials will lead to a long-term gain in a habitable world. And in working to make living here last longer, we might also train ourselves to expect things to last longer, too. Imagine that.
</p>
<h2>
Design that treats grifted information as proprietary material is not good design.
</h2>
<p>
It has often been said that if something is free, then you are the product. It turns out the situation is much more complicated because <i>you</i> are complicated.
</p>
<p>
“You,” to the data-grifter, are a multitude of facts. Some of them you willingly share. Some are gathered when you think no one is watching. And some are inferred by who you know and what the grifters know about them. Consent in this situation is cloudy. What, exactly, are you agreeing to share about yourself when you use a service? Few know.
</p>
<p>
Though the majority of Americans encounter privacy notices multiple times each week, only 22% say they read them all. Even fewer claim to understand what they’re reading. <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2019/11/15/americans-attitudes-and-experiences-with-privacy-policies-and-laws/" target="_blank">That’s a pretty bad state of affairs</a>. One would think that given such poor readership and comprehension of this incredibly important material, these friendly services would make a better effort to communicate it and gain true consent. But the companies that stand to gain the most by gathering information about you stand to lose the most if you actually know what the hell they’re up to. Why? Because whatever you get from them is just the worm they dangle into the pond. You’re the fish; their customers are the fish-eaters.
</p>
<p>
Beyond privacy, disclosure, and consent is ownership. Who owns your information? The question seems to provide the answer: you! It’s <i>your</i> information. But, virtually every service you use claims ownership over the information you provide. That, too, is buried within the virtually impenetrable wall of legal jargon that so many of us never read. That such agreements are written to repel exactly those for whom it is most consequential but designed to be so easily dismissible is what makes the grift a grift.
</p>
<p>
The value of just <i>my</i> name, age, height, weight, education, profession, ethnicity, affiliations, purchases, browsing history, sexual preferences, relationships, thoughts, feelings, and fears is hardly much. Few would buy such information; I would never even think to sell it. But the value of such a data profile for <i>millions</i> is astronomical. The power of being the one to sell it, even more staggering.
</p>
<p>
When you signed up for a place to post your thoughts and pictures, were you consenting to the consignment of your information and the creation of a Machiavellian, rat-king of an information machine against which almost no individual has leverage? When put that way, who on Earth would say “yes”?
</p>
<h2>
Design without philosophy and ethics is not good design.
</h2>
<p>
No idea exists alone. Every idea is the product of other, more foundational ideas. And those ideas, of course, were birthed by ideas that came before them. It’s ideas all the way down.
</p>
<p>
That, in a nutshell, is a theory of knowledge. Or, as the philosophers call it, epistemology. Everything we know is the result of beliefs about …</p></div></div>

																										<p><span>Last updated:</span><time datetime="2021-02-15T16:35:29+00:00">15/02/2021</time></p>
<p><em>After I finished school in 2007 and later graduated from high school in 2012, I thought it was all over. I kind of swore that I’d never touch a textbook again. “Welcome world,” I said, “I’m ready and now I know everything!” Boy was I wrong. I learned the hard way that our complex and rapidly changing world increasingly demands adopting new skills. And what I’ve accumulated as knowledge during my time behind the desk was not even close to what was happening in the real world.</em> <em>Learning, not simply during the years associated with formal schooling, but across the lifespan seemed a must.</em></p>



<p>Mark Twain famously said, “I have never let my schooling interfere with my education.” More than 100 years later, that’s still the case – or at least it should be. We should not, let the material we study now, or years ago when we were in school, satisfy our appetite and our thirst for knowledge.</p>



<p>In our current setting, it’s extremely important to educate yourself and regularly expose yourself to various topics that are not covered by your school, and/or job, curricula. Simply digesting what your teacher shares or what your company is doing is not enough to stay afloat. You need a different point of view. Make unusual connections. Look for inspiration in topics that others might call crazy or insane.</p>



<p>If you’re a student reading this, you probably haven’t yet discovered that the information shared by your teacher is not enough to help you get a <a href="https://durmonski.com/book-summaries/bullshit-jobs/" target="_blank" aria-label="nice job (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">nice job</a> or <a href="https://durmonski.com/business/fewer-moving-parts/" target="_blank" aria-label="start a business (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">start a business</a>. If you have already dealt with the school bureaucracy, fought your way through countless exams and unusually not useful school practices, and you’re now a proud owner of a Job, congrats! You know how little our school system has given to us. You know, I hope, how little you know and how much is yet to be explored. Especially today, when things constantly change and where, as many modern authors state, “change is the only constant.”</p>



<p>Our complex and rapidly changing world creates a need, demands a need, for self-initiated and self-managed learning.</p>



<p>If you still don’t know how little you know, and how much you need to acquire to get a new job, keep your current one, or completely change directions, in this article, I’m going to share why it’s so damn important to become master of your own learning process. To become a sophisticated learner. To learn how to learn and to keep doing it till your very last day.</p>







<h2>What Does Self-Regulated Learning Mean?</h2>



<p>Self-regulation in the learning process is commonly related to formal education. We think that becoming better at learning is not for us if we’re not in school. “I graduated with honors. I don’t need to get better at learning,” you might think.</p>



<p>That may be true. I mean, yes, being your teacher’s favorite student is probably a thought that makes you feel all fuzzy and good. But the information you accumulated in school as I just elegantly pointed out, is not enough – it never was – to transform you into a blossoming individual.</p>



<p>A self-regulated learner is a person who is aware of what he’s consuming and actively working towards self-imposed goals to acquire more relevant information. In this case, relevant means things that are closely related to the interests and skills of that person. Or the interests and skills the person wants to acquire. In other words, self-improving, as banal it might sound.</p>



<p>To avoid interpreting what has just been mentioned as something dry and unimaginable, let us give an example:</p>



<p>So, for example, let’s say that you’re a professional photographer. You’re making a living taking pictures. You are good. You have regular clients. Your <a href="https://durmonski.com/private/using-social-media/" target="_blank" aria-label="Instagram (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Instagram</a> profile is widely known in your country. Yet, for how long you think this will last?</p>



<p>As stated, things are changing. And they are changing fast. Reportedly, video is becoming more and more popular. In this situation, if you want to get to the next level, you probably need to school yourself on shooting and later editing video. Then, probably, you need to figure out how to properly attune your clip to fit across the newly created social media channels. And then, you need to learn all the growth-hack techniques other online entrepreneurs so enthusiastically share on their profiles. </p>



<p>To put it differently, there is always something new to learn. But this is not always obvious. In most situations, we reach a certain level of expertise and we settle. We get comfortable. And the moment we get too cozy with what we know is the moment others get ahead.</p>



<p>Self-regulation means actively monitoring your learning process. Being mindful about how and from where to obtain, and master, new information. Settings goals and motivating yourself to expand your expertise.</p>



<p>Plainly, continuously asking yourself the following: “Is the thing I’m reading, watching right now, helping me get better at X?”</p>







<h2>Why is Self-Regulated Learning Important?</h2>



<p>To make things even more difficult, if we have to go back to the example of the photographer, the simple realization that one needs to learn new things is not enough to make him better. The person also needs to have a good learning process.</p>



<p>Something we’re not thought in school, sadly.</p>



<p>The school, the system that runs the school, doesn’t do much to teach us how to actually improve our learning skills. It’s presumed that we know how to learn and study. The material is handed to us and we are expected to know what to do with it.</p>



<p>Or as stated in a scientific paper about self-regulated learning, “There is an overwhelming assumption in our educational system that the most important thing to deliver to students is content.”<span id="easy-footnote-1-13224"></span><span><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-1-13224" title="Self-Regulated Learning: Beliefs, Techniques, and Illusions &amp;#8211; <a href=&quot;https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146/annurev-psych-113011-143823&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; aria-label=&quot; (opens in a new tab)&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; class=&quot;ek-link&quot;>Annual Reviews</a>."><sup>1</sup></a></span></p>



<p>Besides sharing what is supposedly thought from teachers as great content, there is also a need to organize and remember that content. And today, in the 21st century, there is also the need to find great content. Since there is so much stuff out there, you need to know how to adequately sort the good from the clickbait-y.</p>



<p>Regrettably, schools are not actively teaching us about these things. We’re given a lecture. A paper with resources. Commonly also some sort of assignment. And that’s it. We need to figure how to best connect the pieces. But that’s not the worst of it. We’re also not though that these things also need to happen outside school premises – when we now have jobs and families. That after there is no longer a teacher who is monitoring your assignments and actually imposing them on you, that you should take his role and set assignments for yourself.</p>



<p>When we don’t know any of these things, they end in the graph unknown unknowns.<span id="easy-footnote-2-13224"></span><span><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-2-13224" title="There are known knowns &amp;#8211; <a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/There_are_known_knowns&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; aria-label=&quot; (opens in a new tab)&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; class=&quot;ek-link&quot;>WIKI</a>."><sup>2</sup></a></span> Or in other words, things we don’t know exist. Hence, we don’t do them. And since we don’t do them, we never get better at what we do.</p>



<p>Self-regulating your learning process involves creating your own curriculum – being both the teacher and the student. This involves seriously considering what you want to learn and how you need to approach this subject.</p>







<h2>What Are The Self-Regulated Learning Fundamentals?</h2>



<p>Intuitively, high-achievers know how to approach learning. Or they simply found the best way for them after years of trial and error. Others, in contrast, simply go with the flow and do the most obvious exercise when trying to learn something new: they consume the information in front of them, never actually looking for resources on their own, and hope that some of the facts will stick.</p>



<p>These are not the best strategies, though.</p>



<p>The point of becoming sophisticated as a learner requires knowing how to manage your own learning activities.</p>



<p>It requires planning and the process is guided by metacognition (thinking about thinking). Or in our case, thinking about how to learn better.</p>

<p>This is a deliberate thought process that one must consider before actually approaching anything new. In simple words, this means that you don’t just open Google and start endlessly browsing articles. You first ask yourself: “What do I want to learn?; Why do I want to learn this?” You set expectations and goals. You consider your weaknesses in the learning process and find resources that are most likely to appeal to your persona.</p>



<p>Instead of relying on the algorithms to show you great content, you approach things strategically – you search for great content based on your goal.</p>



<p>Here are the fundamentals to create your own learning process:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Establish a plan and find resources</strong>: The first requirement, sort to say, is asking yourself what do you want to learn and why. Then, figure out what sources you’ll use, and how you’ll find them, to learn the desired thing. And finally, set a learning schedule and form a plan that will help you along the way.</li><li><strong>Monitoring and maintenance of knowledge</strong>: This is often overlooked. You can’t expect to remember everything from your first attempt. You should monitor yourself and find gaps in your skills – your processes. Then, find new ways to approach things that are hard for you to understand. Additionally, since often learning something new requires retention of certain facts, writing down the most important things is also a must.</li><li><strong>Self-reflection and adapting</strong>: Getting a good grade in school feels awesome. Launching a product and making sales is amazing. But these things are just outcomes. Often, the results we get are a lot of times based on luck, not always dependent on what we did. That’s why it’s far more important to reflect on what you think you did that get you these results and why.</li></ul>



<p>Now, once we have the fundamentals, let’s expand this further…</p>







<h2>How to Best Approach Something New?</h2>



<p>To put all of the above into practice, let’s consider another following example:</p>

  <p>I want a better profiler for Rust.
Here’s what a rust-analyzer benchmark looks like:</p>
<div>
<div>

<span>}</span>
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>First, the profiler prints to stderr:</p>
<div>
<div>
<pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
3
</pre></td><td><pre>warning: run with `--release`
warning: add `debug=true` to Cargo.toml
warning: set `RUSTFLAGS="-Cforce-frame-pointers=yes"`
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>Otherwise, if everything is setup correctly, the output is</p>
<div>
<div>
<pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
</pre></td><td><pre>Output is saved to:
   ~/projects/rust-analyzer/profile-results/
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>The <code>profile-results</code> folder contains the following:</p>
<div>
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>report.txt</code> with</p>
<div>
<ul>
<li>
<p>user, cpu, sys time</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>cpu instructions</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>stats for caches &amp; branches a-la <code>pref-stat</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>top ten functions by cumulative time</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>top ten functions by self-time</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>top ten hot-spot</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>flamegraph.svg</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>data.smth</code>, which can be fed into some existing profiler UI (kcachegrind, firefox profiler, etc).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>report.html</code> which contains a basic interactive UI.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>To tweak settings, the following API is available:</p>
<div>
<div>
<pre><code data-lang="rust"><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
3
4
</pre></td><td><pre><span>let</span> <span>_</span><span>p</span> <span>=</span> <span>better_profiler</span><span>::</span><span>profile</span><span>()</span>
  <span>.output</span><span>(</span><span>"./other-dir/"</span><span>)</span>
  <span>.samples_per_second</span><span>(</span><span>999</span><span>)</span>
  <span>.flamegraph</span><span>(</span><span>false</span><span>);</span>
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>Naturally, the following also works and produces an aggregate profile:</p>
<div>
<div>
<pre><code data-lang="rust"><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
3
4
5
6
7
</pre></td><td><pre><span>for</span> <span>_</span> <span>in</span> <span>0</span><span>..</span><span>100</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>{</span>
    <span>let</span> <span>_</span><span>p</span> <span>=</span> <span>profile</span><span>();</span>
    <span>interesting_computation</span><span>();</span>
  <span>}</span>
  <span>not_interesting_computation</span><span>();</span>
<span>}</span>
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>I don’t know how this should work.
I think I would be happy with a perf-based Linux-only implementation.
The <a href="https://github.com/jimblandy/perf-event">perf-event</a> crate by Jim Blandy (co-author of “Programming Rust”) is good.</p>
<p>Have I missed something?
Does this tool already exist?
Or is it impossible for some reason?</p>

<h2 id="0-what-is-active-listening-" data-kb-block="kb-adv-heading_2b06d7-a8"><strong>What is active listening?</strong></h2>
<p>Active listening is the ability to focus completely on a speaker, understand their message, comprehend the information and respond thoughtfully, in a relevant way. Compared to passive listening, this highly valued interpersonal communication skill ensures you’re able to engage with your peer and later recall specific details without needing information repeated. Your partner will feel cared for and listened to, which results in building genuine and honest relationships.</p>
<p>To practice active listening, you make a conscious effort to hear not only the words that another person is saying but, more importantly, the&nbsp;complete message&nbsp;being communicated, subtle hints and non-verbal messages included, such as tone, emphasis, facial expressions and body language.</p>
<p>Active listening is always neutral and nonjudgmental from the listener’s side.</p>
<p>Finally, to practice active listening, you turn an otherwise passive process into an interactive flow by techniques such as eye contact, asking follow-up questions and reflecting back what was said.<br></p>
<h2 id="1-why-is-active-listening-essential-in-a-work-environment-" data-kb-block="kb-adv-heading_14e87a-de"><strong>Why is active listening essential in a work environment?&nbsp;</strong></h2>
<p>First and foremost, <strong>it helps you build trust</strong>. When people know they can speak freely to you without interruptions and judgment, they’ll be more likely to confide in you. This is especially helpful when meeting a new customer or business contact with whom you want to develop a long-term working relationship.</p>
<p><strong>It helps you build genuine and honest connections. </strong>Active listening helps others feel comfortable sharing information with you. When you demonstrate your willingness and ability to listen to what others have to say truly, people will be motivated to communicate with you on a regular basis. This can open up opportunities to collaborate with others, get work done quickly or start new projects. All of these things can help lead you to success in your career. As a manager, this skill is also essential to your success – in fact, the lack of it is <a href="https://ochronus.online/engineering-manager-4-ways-of-failure/#3-4-too-much-solving-not-enough-listening">one of the key ways to fail</a>.</p>
<p><strong>It helps you increase your knowledge and understanding of various topics. </strong>The best employees are always striving to learn something new and grow their knowledge base. Because active listening helps you retain information, it will also help you better understand new topics and remember what you’ve learned so you can apply it in the future.</p>
<p><strong>It helps you identify and solve problems. </strong>Actively listening to others will help you detect challenges and difficulties others face or problems within projects. The more quickly you’re able to spot these issues, you sooner you can find a solution or create a plan to address it.</p>
<h2 id="2-how-can-active-listening-be-beneficial-while-searching-for-a-job-" data-kb-block="kb-adv-heading_6339e7-8f"><p><strong>How can active listening be beneficial while searching for a job?</strong></p></h2>
<p>Active listening is beneficial throughout the whole process of searching for a job.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When you look at job advertisements and research companies, you can look for clues that might help you learn more about the company before you apply. Don’t just look at the words, though. Try to identify the tone of the post. Does the job posting use formal language? Casual? Conversational? Does it use a lot of technical jargon or industry language? Does it seem frantic? All of these can help determine what the job and company are like and help you decide if you want to apply. Actively listen to the company website’s tone to learn more about the company culture. What images do they use? Are they stock photos, formal portraits, or candid images? Are there videos you can watch (and listen to!)? How formal or informal is the narrator? What do you find on social media? All of these clues can help you figure out if the company is the right fit for you.</p>

<p>Naturally, the best place to utilize your active listening skills is the interview. You gather much more information this way, both because of encouraging your interviewer to be more honest with you and asking clarifying and follow-up questions. Active listening can also boost your evaluation during and after an interview. More and more companies recognize that good communication skills are essential for job success and even company culture and are actively looking for it during interviews. Even if you interview at a company which does not focus on this, you will leave a good impression by being an active listener – you’ll seem more interested in the job than other candidates. It will be in general much more enjoyable for the interviewer to talk to you. Last but not least, actively listening to your interviewer, you’ll get a glimpse of what kind of communication standards are present in your target company and whether you’d enjoy working there.</p>

<h2 id="3-how-can-you-best-practice-active-listening-" data-kb-block="kb-adv-heading_3396a3-a4"><p><strong>How can you best practice active listening?</strong></p></h2>
<p>Active listening starts with the <strong>right intent</strong>. If you don’t actually care about what the other person wants to say it will be tough to listen genuinely. We are frequently rushing from meeting to meeting, and our minds are already on the next thing we need to do when talking to someone. Slowing down and taking some time (even a minute can help!) to refocus our attention and prepare right before the discussion starts is essential. If you know the topic in advance, think a bit about it while considering your peer’s context with regards to it. What is their potential goal with the conversation, what do they hope to get out of it? What mindset would that result in, and how could that influence the discussion? How can you best support them?</p>
<p><strong>Be curious</strong> about what the other person has to say. Actively work on putting your judgment aside and be neutral, even when what they say strikes a nerve. Giving feedback is generally not a part of active listening, it comes after that and only if the other person asked for it.</p>
<p>Giving <strong>verbal and non-verbal affirmations and cues</strong> is key so that your peer actually feels that you are listening to them.</p>
<p><strong>Don’t interrupt</strong> your partner while they are speaking. Use non-verbal cues to demonstrate that you’re following along.</p>
<p><strong>Shut down your internal dialogue</strong> – this both helps you focus and keeps you judgment-free.</p>
<p><strong>Be patien</strong>t with the other person – you might feel the discussion is dragging on but remember your role is to listen, not to enforce your agenda! On a related note, don’t abruptly change the subject until you’ve made sure your peer said what they wanted to about the topic at hand.</p>
<h3 id="4-%C2%A0-what-are-some-verbal-ways-to-demonstrate-active-listening-" data-kb-block="kb-adv-heading_0a582e-27">&nbsp;<p><strong>What are some verbal ways to demonstrate active listening?</strong></p></h3>
<div id="ub_click_to_tweet_2e93aedf-b3c7-4b1f-a68f-02ac99c7326e"><p>A <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/08934215.2011.610731" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2011 study</a> concluded that active listening was primarily associated with verbal social skills.</p></div>
<p>One of the most important techniques to verbally demonstrating active listening is paraphrasing. This is a form of reflecting on what you’ve heard by summarizing the message’s main points in your own words. When you do this, you show that you understand the message and you’re also giving a chance to your peer to clarify or expand it further. An example: “So you’re basically saying that our training process works in general, but could use some improvement, right?</p>
<p>Asking <strong>open-ended follow-up questions</strong> is equally important. Ask these questions in a way that demonstrates that you’ve gathered the essence of what your partner was saying and also guide them to share more or more in-depth information. This technique can be used together with paraphrasing. Open-ended questions are ones that cannot be answered with a simple “yes” or “no” but instead require your peer to elaborate. An example, building on the previous paragraph: “I understand you feel our training process could be improved – what changes would you like to see?”</p>
<p>Besides open-ended questions, you can ask more specific probing questions too. These questions drill deeper into topics or can be used to narrow down the scope of a subject that might be too broad to discuss in one setting. Example: “Could you elaborate a bit on how the sequencing of training sessions was unhelpful?”&nbsp;</p>
<p>Learn more about questions as a coaching technique here: <a href="https://ochronus.online/questions-vs-directions/">Coaching Questions vs. Giving Directions – Ochronus online</a></p>
<p><strong>Displaying empathy</strong> goes a long way in conversations and is key in active listening. Ensure your peer understands that you recognize their emotions and maybe even share their feelings. Go a step further with showing compassion which will help you connect with your partner and establish mutual trust. Example: “Going through that kind of an experience must have been hard for you; I’m really sorry!”</p>
<p>You can <strong>share similar experiences</strong> to show you deeply understand what your peer is talking about. It will also help build the relationship and – depending on the goal of the situation – can turn into you giving valuable advice about how you’ve solved similar challenges in the past. Example: “I also had a tough time with the training process years ago. This is how I made it better: ….”</p>
<p><strong>Short verbal affirmations and cues</strong> are probably the easiest way to show that you’re following along and are still engaged. Some of these can even be used while the speaker is talking without interrupting them. Examples: “Mhm”, “I see”, “I agree”.</p>
<p>Nothing demonstrates that you care about your peer and the topic at hand than <strong>recalling relevant, previously shared information</strong>. Example: “Oh, true, and I remember you shared your ideas about improving our training process – let’s make sure we implement those ideas!”</p>
<h3 id="5-what-are-some-non-verbal-ways-to-demonstrate-active-listening-" data-kb-block="kb-adv-heading_343c56-85"><p><strong>What are some non-verbal ways to demonstrate active listening?&nbsp;</strong></p></h3>
<p>Non-verbal cues are just as important as verbal ones in active listening, and there is a set of simple things you can do here. Use a combination of the following techniques:</p>
<p>Maintaining <strong>eye contact</strong> is a sure way to make the speaker feel you’re focused on them. Make sure your gaze is natural and conveys a feeling of interest and care.</p>

February 12, 2021 | http://www.rzepa.net/blog/?p=14437 | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/http://www.rzepa.net/blog/?p=14437">archive.org</a>

				<div kcite-section-id="14437">
<p>I recently received two emails each with a subject line&nbsp;<i>new approaches to research reporting</i>. The traditional 350 year-old model of the (scientific) journal is undergoing upheavals at the moment with the introduction of APCs (article processing charges), a refereeing crisis and much more. Some argue that brand new thinking is now required. Here are two such innovations (and I leave you to judge whether that last word should have an appended ?).</p>

<p>To set the scene for the first, I will quote the abstract: “<em>The single figure publication is a novel, efficient format by which to communicate scholarly advances. It will serve as a forerunner of the nano-publication, a modular unit of information critical for machine-driven data aggregation and knowledge integration</em><span id="cite_ITEM-14437-0" name="citation"><a href="#ITEM-14437-0">[1]</a></span> The kernel of this suggestion is (again I quote) “<em>We offer the idea of the micro-publication unit, the single figure publication (SFP), to provide scholars with a real-world, manageable method to inform research</em>.” I was struck by the overlap between this suggestion and the one you may find on many of the posts on this blog, where what I refer to as <a href="http://www.ch.imperial.ac.uk/rzepa/blog/?p=13248" target="_blank">FAIR Data</a> is assigned a digital object identifier (DOI) and included in the citation lists at the end of the post. The key phrase in the above abstract is&nbsp;<em>machine-driven data aggregation and knowledge, </em>although the article does not really go into any&nbsp;mechanisms for easily achieving this. It is my argument that the act of assigning a DOI carries with it the association that there is machine searchable metadata which can be retrieved and used for the aggregation and knowledge mining. The authors of this article, Do and Mobley, advocate adoption of nanopublications defined by inclusion of just a single figure (notably, not a table of results!) and some accompanying context which they claim would reduce&nbsp;the unit of publication to a more tractable size. This does raise the question of whether science needs more publications (in chemistry alone there are said to be more than a million published each year) or whether we should instead be concentrating our efforts on improving the data side of things by increasing its semantic content and formalising its structures, its preservation and curation. I certainly argue that far too little effort has been poured into these latter activities. You only have to look at the typical SI (supporting information) associated with many chemistry articles to realise that in many cases they are still hardly fit for purpose.&nbsp;There is one concept introduced by&nbsp;Do and Mobley that also deserves mention. Their nanopublications&nbsp;are structured to be read by machines, not people. They will therefore <strong>not</strong> be refereed by people (my inference). They do not really discuss how else the quality will be assessed, but of course if you treat their nanopublication as essentially FAIR data, then it does become possible to develop methods of machine refereeing.</p>
<p>The second email alerted me to an article<span id="cite_ITEM-14437-1" name="citation"><a href="#ITEM-14437-1">[2]</a></span> in the Winnower, a forum that offers a bridge between “<em>traditional scholarly publishing tools to traditional&nbsp;and&nbsp;non-traditional scholarly outputs—because scholarly communication doesn’t just happen in scholarly journals</em>“. Here, the concept of scholarly communication is extended to the <em><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/science/" target="_blank">New Reddit Journal of Science</a>&nbsp;</em>and introduces the concept pioneered by reddit of the AMA, or “ask me anything” environment. I occasionally publish some of the posts on this blog&nbsp;to the Winnower, receiving in return the increasingly ubiquitous DOI. I have also occasionally quoted these DOIs in articles submitted to conventional chemistry journals. What we see now is the propagation of a Winnower DOI on to e.g.&nbsp;https://www.reddit.com/r/science/ where anyone<sup>†</sup> can post a question related to the original research reporting. I must state that I do have some reservations about this. Whilst it is likely that the majority of traditional scholarly reporting is likely to receive no AMAs (just as a very high proportion of research articles attract few if any citations in other articles over a period of decades), it is also likely that the quality of posted AMAs may turn out to be very low. At which point the original researcher has to make a judgement as to whether to devote any of their increasingly precious and fragmented time to answering them. And if few if any answers are posted in response to an AMA, the system seems unlikely to flourish.</p>
<p>But what we see here are two serious attempts to develop new approaches to research reporting, and not doubt others will emerge. To quote Yogi Berra, the future is not what it used to be.</p>
<hr>
<p><sup>†</sup>Anyone can also post to this blog to ask similar questions. But note that associating an <a href="http://www.ch.imperial.ac.uk/rzepa/blog/?p=13974" target="_blank">ORCID</a> with such comments is highly recommended. I do not think that reddit currently supports ORCID, but &nbsp;I would argue if the intent is serious, it certainly should.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <p><strong>Today you are frustrated.</strong></p>

<p>This is so annoying. Youâ€™ve written a Rust crate and now that you want to test it for the very first time, <em>it doesnâ€™t work!</em></p>

<p>Come on, Rust! How dare you? You promised that once one gets past the compiler, it.<br>
<em>Just.<br>
<strong>Works!</strong></em><br>
And now this!</p>

<p>Ok, ok. You calm yourself down. Lets start from the beginning. You want to create so called <a href="https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/native/guides/minidumps/">minidumps</a>. This is a file that contains information about a crashed program (like stacks of all threads, CPU registers, system info, etc.).
The minidump consists of various sections, such as the minidump header (including time of day, versions and basically a table of contents), a thread section (including all threads of the process and their stacks), memory mappings and libraries, etc. [Just to give some context, as all of this is actually not really important.]</p>

<p>For this, you created a <a href="https://github.com/msirringhaus/minidump_writer_linux">crate</a>. One section gets written after the other, while information about the targeted process is retrieved from the system. You even created a nice, simple API. You hand in a process ID and an open file, where the minidump should be written to. like this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>    <span>MinidumpWriter</span><span>::</span><span>new</span><span>(</span><span>pid</span><span>,</span> <span>blamed_thread</span><span>)</span>
        <span>.dump</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>mut</span> <span>dump_file</span><span>)</span>
        <span>.expect</span><span>(</span><span>"Dumping failed!"</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>You can also hand in user specified memory regions that should be included in the dump, like so:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>    <span>let</span> <span>app_memory</span> <span>=</span> <span>AppMemory</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>ptr</span><span>:</span> <span>some_address</span><span>,</span>
        <span>length</span><span>:</span> <span>memory_size</span><span>,</span>
    <span>};</span>

    <span>MinidumpWriter</span><span>::</span><span>new</span><span>(</span><span>pid</span><span>,</span> <span>pid</span><span>)</span>
        <span>.set_app_memory</span><span>(</span><span>vec!</span><span>[</span><span>app_memory</span><span>])</span>
        <span>.dump</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>mut</span> <span>tmpfile</span><span>)</span>
        <span>.expect</span><span>(</span><span>"Dumping failed"</span><span>);</span>
</code></pre></div></div>



<p>But when you run your nice library code in an application, you get <code>'Dumping failed: "Failed in ptrace::read: Sys(EIO)"'</code>.</p>

<p><em>How useless is that?!</em></p>

<p>Okay, maybe you could enhance your library error handling, a little. And by enhance, you mean â€œimplement one in the first placeâ€�.</p>

<h2 id="state-of-the-dart">State of the dart</h2>

<p>Your current approach is to define</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>type</span> <span>Error</span> <span>=</span> <span>Box</span><span>&lt;</span><span>dyn</span> <span>error</span><span>::</span><span>Error</span> <span>+</span> <span>std</span><span>::</span><span>marker</span><span>::</span><span>Send</span> <span>+</span> <span>std</span><span>::</span><span>marker</span><span>::</span><span>Sync</span><span>&gt;</span><span>;</span>
<span>pub</span> <span>type</span> <span>Result</span><span>&lt;</span><span>T</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>=</span> <span>result</span><span>::</span><span>Result</span><span>&lt;</span><span>T</span><span>,</span> <span>Error</span><span>&gt;</span><span>;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>and using <code>Result&lt;T&gt;</code> in all of your functions as the return value and handing all of them to the parent function using <code>?</code>. Thus the original error pierces through your callstack like a dart throughâ€¦.jelly (Yes, you are good with words and you know it.).</p>

<div><div><pre><code>    <span>pub</span> <span>fn</span> <span>init</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>mut</span> <span>self</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Result</span><span>&lt;</span><span>()</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>self</span><span>.read_auxv</span><span>()</span><span>?</span><span>;</span>
        <span>self</span><span>.enumerate_threads</span><span>()</span><span>?</span><span>;</span>
        <span>self</span><span>.enumerate_mappings</span><span>()</span><span>?</span><span>;</span>
        <span>Ok</span><span>(())</span>
    <span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>In Rust parlance, this is also called bubbling up errors.</p>

<p>Usually, you just bubble up errors from libraries you use, but for the rare errors you have to define yourself, you currently just do</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>Err</span><span>(</span><span>"Found no auxv entry"</span><span>.into</span><span>())</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Well, now you know there is an error, at least. And that it has <em>something</em> to do with your usage of <code>ptrace</code>. But you have no idea where that happens. You use that functionality in various places. Is it during the init-phase? During one of the sections? And if so, which one? What are you trying to read? And from where? Or in short: <strong>What is going on?!</strong></p>

<h2 id="shoes-off-get-some-tea-research-time">Shoes off, get some tea: Research time!</h2>

<p>Well, Rust has been around for quite some time now and they always boast about how error handling is a first class citizen and all that. So error handling should be a done deal, right? With a canonical way of dealing with errors, officially documented and all that should be right there, correct?</p>

<p>Oh boy, were you wrong.</p>

<p>Turns out, this is a very active field ofâ€¦mhâ€¦experimentation, lets say. There has been <a href="https://blog.yoshuawuyts.com/error-handling-survey/">a survey</a> recently, listing and quickly describing most the different libraries and ways for error handling that emerged, fallen out of favor, got forked, died anyways, got superseded, fallen out of favor again, etc.
And the opinions seem to change frequently, if you should use <code>error-chain</code> or <code>failure</code> or <code>fehler</code> or <code>snafu</code> or <code>thiserror</code> or <code>anyhow</code> or <code>eyre</code> orâ€¦</p>

<p>You opened a can of hornets there, or whatever that saying is.</p>

<p>Then you find <a href="https://blog.rust-lang.org/inside-rust/2020/11/23/What-the-error-handling-project-group-is-working-on.html">this gem</a> and donâ€™t know if you should laugh or cry. Almost six years after Rust hit 1.0 an error handling project group is formed. Six. Years. <em>(heavy breathing)</em></p>

<p>Well, okay. At least they are sorting it out now. Problem is, you needâ€¦.<em>SIX YEARS? Are you serious?</em>â€¦ahem, sorryâ€¦Problem is, you need helpful error messages now.</p>

<p>After reading a few decent blogs on the topic (like <a href="http://www.sheshbabu.com/posts/rust-error-handling/">this</a> or <a href="https://nick.groenen.me/posts/rust-error-handling/">that</a>), there seems to emerge a consensus, at least for libraries: Return something that derives from <code>std::error::Error</code>. Either implement them by hand, or use a crate that does it for you, using macro magic. like <code>thiserror</code>. Which method you use depends on your level of laziness plus your patience regarding compile times.</p>

<h2 id="examples-vs-reality">Examples vs. Reality</h2>

<p>Another post highlighted <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/error/multiple_error_types/wrap_error.html">error wrapping</a>, a particularly intriguing idea to you.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, all the articles have the understandable, but rather annoying tendency to use very simple example code for illustration purposes. Unrealistically simple, you might even say. They have callstacks of depth 1, return only three kinds of error in total in their API, and their errors are obvious and easily describable (e.g. â€œInput file XY not found in your â€˜counting wordsâ€™ programâ€�).</p>

<p>You have a more complicated callstack, with tons of different errors and code reuse in different places. For example, the function you think is to blame for the above error is <code>copy_from_process()</code>, which calls <code>ptrace::read()</code>, which probably returns something like <code>Failed in ptrace::read: Sys(EIO)</code>.
This function is used in multiple places in your code, e.g.:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>â”œâ”€ init()
â”‚   â”œâ”€ read_auxv()
â”‚   â”‚  â”œâ”€ open(format!("/proc/{}/auxv", self.pid))
â”‚   â”‚  â””â”€ some_parsing()
â”‚   â”œâ”€ ...
â”‚   â”œâ”€ enumerate_mappings()
â”‚   â”‚  â”œâ”€ open(format!("/proc/{}/maps", self.pid))
â”‚   â”‚  â””â”€ some_parsing()
â”‚   â”‚
â”‚   â””â”€ some_more_checks()
â”‚      â””â”€ copy_from_process()
â”‚
â””â”€ dump()
   â”‚
   â”œâ”€ sections::header::write()
   â”‚
   â”œâ”€ sections::thread_list_stream::write()
   â”‚  â””â”€ copy_from_process()
   â”‚
   â”œâ”€ sections::mappings::write()
   â”‚  â””â”€ elf_identifier_for_mapping()
   â”‚     â””â”€ copy_from_process()
   â”‚
   â”œâ”€ sections::app_memory::write()
   â”‚  â””â”€ copy_from_process()
   â”‚
   â””â”€ ...
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Same goes for opening files, which happens in multiple places (two examples of which are shown in <code>init()</code>), so getting <code>FileNotFound</code> without context is going to be equally fun, and so on.</p>



<p>Wrapping errors still sounds like a nice idea, but one layer alone is not going to <del>wrap it</del> cut it.
Going with <code>copy_from_process()</code> as an example, you see a few possibilities:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Wrapping the <code>ptrace</code> error into an <code>CopyFromProcessError</code>, but that gives you nothing (except maybe some context, if you add some)</li>
  <li>With <code>InitError</code>s and <code>DumpingError</code>s that wrap the <code>ptrace</code> errors, you will still not know which section failed and why, but know if it was during <code>init()</code> or not.</li>
</ol>

<p>You might add context to option 2 as well (see below on how), but each section has a variety of reasons why it could fail. Some unique to the section, some shared among a few, some among all of them.</p>

<p>Complex problems sometimes require complex solutions, maybe?</p>

<h2 id="inc-err-ption">Inc <em>Err()</em> ption</h2>

<p>Using <code>thiserror</code> and the fabulous <code>#[from]</code> macro, you quickly define a plethora of errors and wrappers, starting from the deepest, darkest places in your callstack, wrapping your way up:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>#[derive(Debug,</span> <span>Error)]</span>
<span>pub</span> <span>enum</span> <span>PtraceDumperError</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>#[error(</span><span>"nix::ptrace() error"</span><span>)]</span>
    <span>PtraceError</span><span>(</span><span>#[from]</span> <span>nix</span><span>::</span><span>Error</span><span>),</span>
    <span>...</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>#[derive(Debug,</span> <span>Error)]</span>
<span>pub</span> <span>enum</span> <span>SectionAppMemoryError</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>#[error(</span><span>"Failed to copy memory from process"</span><span>)]</span>
    <span>CopyFromProcessError</span><span>(</span><span>#[from]</span> <span>PtraceDumperError</span><span>),</span>
    <span>...</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>#[derive(Debug,</span> <span>Error)]</span>
<span>pub</span> <span>enum</span> <span>DumpError</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>#[error(</span><span>"Error during init phase"</span><span>)]</span>
    <span>InitError</span><span>(</span><span>#[from]</span> <span>InitError</span><span>),</span>
    <span>#[error(transparent)]</span>
    <span>PtraceDumperError</span><span>(</span><span>#[from]</span> <span>PtraceDumperError</span><span>),</span>
    <span>#[error(</span><span>"Failed when writing section AppMemory"</span><span>)]</span>
    <span>SectionAppMemoryError</span><span>(</span><span>#[from]</span> <span>SectionAppMemoryError</span><span>),</span>
    <span>...</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The fun part is: You have to touch very little of your existing code, thanks to the automatic conversion from one error to the other, conveniently provided by <code>#[from]</code>:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>- pub fn init(&amp;mut self) -&gt; Result&lt;()&gt; {
</span><span>+ pub fn init(&amp;mut self) -&gt; Result&lt;(), InitError&gt; {
</span>     self.read_auxv()?;
     self.enumerate_threads()?;
     self.enumerate_mappings()?;
     Ok(())
 }
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>or</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>- pub fn get_stack_info(&amp;self, int_stack_pointer: usize) -&gt; Result&lt;(usize, usize)&gt; {
</span><span>+ pub fn get_stack_info(&amp;self, int_stack_pointer: usize) -&gt; Result&lt;(usize, usize), DumperError&gt; {
</span> // snip

    let mapping = self
        .find_mapping(stack_pointer)
<span>-        .ok_or("No mapping for stack pointer found")?;
</span><span>+        .ok_or(DumperError::NoStackPointerMapping)?;
</span>    let offset = stack_pointer - mapping.start_address;
    let distance_to_end = mapping.size - offset;
  // snip
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>If you run your test binary again, you now get</p>
<div><div><pre><code>Failed when writing section AppMemory
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>which isâ€¦.<em>(Throws a stack of papers from the desk)</em>â€¦short. Too short, and not that much more helpful, actually. Well, you know which section is failing. Thats good. But where are all the nice error messages you specified in your errors?</p>

<p>Hm, you do only use <code>println!("{}", error);</code>. Maybe <code>{:?}</code> is better?</p>
<div><div><pre><code>SectionAppMemoryError(CopyFromProcessError(PtraceError(Sys(EIO))))
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Aha! Now you are getting somewhere! Tiny, tiny, painfully <strong>tiny</strong> steps, but you are getting somewhere! No error texts, but at least a chain!</p>

<p>Normal printing doesnâ€™t seem to recursively go through all the wrapped errors, but stop at the top most. For this, you need to either go through all the errors yourself by hand, or use a crate that does this for you. There are a number of them that provide this, but <code>anyhow</code> will do (its by the same author as <code>thiserror</code>, so interoperability shouldnâ€™t be an issue).</p>

<div><div><pre><code>    <span>println!</span><span>(</span><span>"{:#}"</span><span>,</span> <span>anyhow</span><span>::</span><span>Error</span><span>::</span><span>new</span><span>(</span><span>error</span><span>));</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>aaaaand:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>Failed when writing section AppMemory: Failed to copy memory from process: nix::ptrace() error: EIO: I/O error
</code></pre></div></div>

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>Whether it was our first call or our hundredth, founders inevitably asked me whether they should market and sell their enterprise software to buyers/executives (top-down) or to users (bottom-up). My view, which only strengthened every time I uttered it, was this:</p>

<p>Marketing and selling to users is just another, roundabout way of getting to the buyer. Compared with the top-down approach — think whitepapers and meetings with the CIO — it takes more effort and time to see a payoff. More effort because users want a smooth self-serve experience, which means more product work. More time because big budget decisions are made at the executive level, which means you are just adding more hoops to hop through before meeting the CIO.</p>

<p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/e1d7c01d1b02afb36c6da331334936f4823d9ce9/0dfc5/images/uploads/343.jpg" alt="Cartoon about dogs in the board room."></p>

<p>More recently this inevitable question evolved from “top-down or bottom-up?” to “what do you think of product-led growth?”</p>

<p><a href="https://www.gkogan.co/product-led-growth/">Product-led growth</a> is the strategy of getting to the users first. It emphasizes letting users see, test, and get value from the product quickly and on their own. Since it’s an evolution of “bottom-up,” my answer was more or less the same.</p>

<p>Sure, there were success stories like Atlassian and GitLab, but those were exceptions to the rule, especially for enterprise software.</p>

<p><strong>I was wrong.</strong></p>

<p>Although the clues had been all around me for months, I paid them no mind until they hit me in the face in quick succession:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Late in November I had an intro call with yet another founder interested in product-led growth.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A week later, another founder brought up product-led growth. Not as a question but as a decision they’ve made. (I now <a href="https://www.gkogan.co/blog/pinecone/">work</a> for this <a href="https://www.pinecone.io/">company</a> in part because of that decision.)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The next day, I attended several sessions at FC Build, where CEOs of unicorn and public companies mentioned product-led growth either as a major contributor to their growth or a major area of focus in the future.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The day after, I spoke on a panel about developer marketing, with other panelists from Twilio, Google Cloud, and Sequoia. In this discussion I heard “developer marketing” used interchangeably with “product-led growth.” (Much of my work involves marketing to developers, yet I never thought of it as product-led growth.) The event organizer holds a panel like this every month, and this one had the most attendants of all.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A week later, Tomasz Tunguz of Redpoint Ventures made a <a href="https://tomtunguz.com/2021-predictions/">prediction</a> that “Product-led growth [will become] the standard GTM for software and infrastructure companies” in 2021.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<hr>

<p>Over a few reflective days in December, other clues from the past year started coming into focus:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>My three biggest opportunities of the year — two unicorns and one Fortune-50 company — revolved around product-led growth. (Having failed to recognize it at the time, I lost those opportunities.)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some of the projects I enjoyed most were really about product-led growth: Launching a trial and growing data scientist users for <a href="https://www.dominodatalab.com/">Domino Data Lab</a>, increasing self-serve revenue from developers for <a href="https://www.netlify.com/">Netlify</a>, and commercializing open-source software for <a href="https://www.goteleport.com/">Teleport</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Seemingly every one of my startup clients and every other prospective client had asked me about product-led growth at some point, indicating widespread interest among founders and their investors.</p>

    <p>As I researched enterprise software companies that recently went public for my <a href="https://www.gkogan.co/blog/category-creation/">category creation</a> post, I noticed more than half of them offer free trials.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>To ensure I wasn’t just seeing what I wanted to see, I emailed five investors with a question: “How much (or little) demand are you seeing for product-led growth compared to enterprise demand-gen?” Four out of five confirmed seeing strong demand and opportunity for product-led growth among startups; one remained neutral.</p>

<p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/399f678b2d026ec46d1dbd67095ad42bd7552e52/80e97/images/uploads/370.jpg" alt="Cartoon about getting a second opinion."></p>

<p>The trend was clear: Software purchasing decisions are increasingly starting with the users. “What tools do my engineers need,” “what do they already use,” “can they try this,” “what do they think of this?” Ironically, calling the CIO is now a roundabout way of getting to the users.</p>

<p>I changed my mind about product-led growth. Software companies not already targeting users (over buyers) should consider changing theirs.</p>

                    <!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>I have been exploring how disk-oriented databases efficiently move data in and out of disk. One way, that I explored in <a href="https://brunocalza.me/discovering-and-exploring-mmap-using-go/">Discovering and exploring <em>mmap</em> using Go</a> and <a href="https://brunocalza.me/but-how-exactly-databases-use-mmap/">But how, exactly, databases use <em>mmap</em>?</a>, is through <strong>memory-mapped files</strong>. Although <code>mmap</code> is a really neat solution, it has some troubles. Most troubles come from the fact that the database has no control of how pages are flushed to disk since that job is carried through the OS. Because of that most databases avoid using <code>mmap</code>. However, they still need to read and write data from disk in an efficient manner. And the answer to that is: <strong>buffer pool</strong>.</p>
<p>In this post,  we'll explain how a <strong>buffer pool manager</strong> works and how to implement one in <strong>Go</strong>. But first, let's do a simple recap of how data is structured in disk.</p>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><h2 id="how-a-database-file-is-structured">How a database file is structured?</h2><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>The file in disk that stores data of a database is just, in most databases, an array of bytes organized into fixed-length blocks called <strong>pages</strong>. A database file is a linear array of continuous <strong>pages</strong>.</p>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><figure><img src="https://brunocalza.me/content/images/2021/02/image.png" alt=""><figcaption>A database file is organized into fixed-length blocks called <strong>pages</strong></figcaption></figure><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>The page length is usually a multiple of the filesystem block length ranging from <strong>512 bytes</strong> to <strong>16KB</strong>. <em>PostgreSQL</em>, for example, uses <strong>8KB</strong>,  although a different page size can be selected when compiling the server<sup>[1]</sup>. <em>InnoDB</em>, a storage engine used in MySQL, uses <strong>16KB</strong> for page size<sup>[2]</sup>.</p>
<p>The layout of these pages is not the scope of this post. However, just to give a glimpse of what happens when writes are executed, think that, for row-oriented databases, tuples are appended inside the page until it is filled up. When the page is filled up, another page needs to be allocated to support incoming writes.</p>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><h2 id="the-buffer-pool-manager">The buffer pool manager</h2><p>So we have our data in disk and the database wants to access it, let's say, through a <strong>SELECT</strong> command. Or we have new incoming data, that we want to store. In order to manage reads and writes efficiently, the common practice is to avoid touching the disk directly. The <strong>execution engine</strong> that is processing the commands has no access to disk. It has access to an <strong>in-memory intermediate layer abstraction</strong> called <strong>buffer pool</strong>. </p><figure><img src="https://brunocalza.me/content/images/2021/02/image-8.png" alt=""><figcaption>High level architecture of how data is accessed by the execution engine</figcaption></figure><p>The <strong>execution engine</strong> requests pages from the <strong>buffer pool</strong> by providing a <strong>page identifier</strong>. It can read the content of the page and send the data to the client. Or it can modify the content of the page and send it back to the <strong>buffer pool</strong> so that the change can be persisted. The execution engine<strong> </strong>access the buffer pool thinking that it is accessing the disk. </p><p>I really think the term buffer pool is kind of misleading here, and it confused me a lot. And that's because the purpose of this structure is not only to manage a pool of empty buffers and its reuse but also it is responsible for <strong>caching the disk pages into memory for future reuse</strong> (not only by the requesting thread but also for concurrent threads). And as with any cache, also responsible for <strong>caching replacement policy</strong>. For this reason, a more appropriate name for the buffer pool is <strong>page cache</strong>. With this in mind, you can imagine the importance of the buffer pool for speeding up the database access to disk.</p><p>The buffer pool can be implemented with a statically allocated array of <strong>frames</strong>. Frames start empty and fill up as pages are being requested. There is an associative structure called <strong>page table</strong><em>, </em>that indicates which page is being held by each frame. </p><figure><img src="https://brunocalza.me/content/images/2021/02/image-2.png" alt=""><figcaption>A representation of a full buffer pool</figcaption></figure><p>The above image indicates the two data structures used for implementing a buffer pool: a <strong>frame array </strong>and a <strong>page table</strong>. The image represents a buffer pool that can cache a maximum of 4 pages. The pages being cached are 4, 5, 6, and 7. The arrows indicate where the page can be found in memory (in the array of frames). Let's look into another buffer pool:</p><figure><img src="https://brunocalza.me/content/images/2021/02/image-3.png" alt=""><figcaption>A representation of a buffer pool with one empty frame</figcaption></figure><p>At this, we can see that there are 3 pages in cache, and one space left. The frames that are free and are ready for receiving a new page are tracked in an additional structure called <strong>free list</strong>. </p><p>The <strong>pages in red</strong> indicate the pages that are being accessed by some thread. That indication is very important because it means that the page cannot leave the buffer pool until all accesses are finished. We will be back to this. </p><p>Another important concept is <strong>page replacement</strong>. <strong>What happens when the cache is full, and a page that is not in the cache is requested?</strong> We need to evict a page that is not being accessed and give its frame to the requested page. There are many algorithms (or policies) to decide which page to evict. We'll talk about this later.</p><p>With these concepts in mind, here is how we can represent our buffer pool in <strong>Go</strong> code</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><pre><code>//BufferPoolManager represents the buffer pool manager
type BufferPoolManager struct {
	diskManager DiskManager
	pages       [MaxPoolSize]*Page
	replacer    *ClockReplacer
	freeList    []FrameID
	pageTable   map[PageID]FrameID
}

//NewBufferPoolManager returns a empty buffer pool manager
func NewBufferPoolManager(DiskManager DiskManager, clockReplacer *ClockReplacer) *BufferPoolManager {
	freeList := make([]FrameID, 0)
	pages := [MaxPoolSize]*Page{}
	for i := 0; i &lt; MaxPoolSize; i++ {
		freeList = append(freeList, FrameID(i))
		pages[FrameID(i)] = nil
	}
	return &amp;BufferPoolManager{DiskManager, pages, clockReplacer, freeList, make(map[PageID]FrameID)}
}
</code></pre>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>The buffer pool receives a <code>DiskManager</code> implementation and a <code>replacer</code>. In our case, we are going to implement the <strong>clock replacement policy</strong>, implemented by <code>ClockReplacer</code>, for page eviction. Internally, <code>pages</code> represents the frame array of fixed size (<code>MaxPoolSize</code>); <code>pageTable</code> is a <code>map</code> the indicates which frame holds which page; and <code>freeList</code> tracks the array of <code>free</code> frames. Initially, we have all frames ids inside the <code>freeList</code>, because all frames are free. That also means all frames pointing to <code>nil</code>.</p>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>And here is the <strong>API</strong> provided by our buffer pool implementation:</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><pre><code>NewPage() *Page
FetchPage(pageID PageID) *Page
FlushPage(pageID PageID) bool
FlushAllPages()
DeletePage(pageID PageID) error
UnpinPage(pageID PageID, isDirty bool) error
</code></pre>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><ul>
<li><strong><code>NewPage() *Page</code></strong>: a clean new page can be requested. The buffer pool will ask the disk manager for a new page id;</li>
<li><strong><code>FetchPage(pageID PageID) *Page</code></strong>: fetches a known page. If the page is in cache, it is immidiatatly returned. If not, the buffer pool will find it on disk and cache it;</li>
<li><strong><code>FlushPage(pageID PageID) bool</code></strong>: writes the page that is in cache to disk;</li>
<li><strong><code>FlushAllPages()</code></strong> writes all pages in cache to disk;</li>
<li><strong><code>DeletePage(pageID PageID) error</code></strong>: deletes page from cache and disk;</li>
<li><strong><code>UnpinPage(pageID PageID, isDirty bool) error</code></strong>: indicates that the page is not used any more for the current requesting thread. If no more threads are using this page, the page is considered for eviction.</li>
</ul>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><h2 id="how-to-represent-a-page">How to represent a page</h2><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>We are going to represent our page in a very simple manner. Our focus here is to learn how the buffer pool works.  Our page is just a <code>[]byte</code> followed by an <code>id</code>. There is some metadata that needs to be tracked. One is the <code>pinCount</code> that tracks the number of concurrent accesses. Each time the page is accessed the <code>pinCount</code> is increased. When it is no more in use, the <code>pinCount</code> is decreased. So, if the <code>pinCount</code> is greater than 0, we say the page is <em>pinned</em> and it is indicated in our figures by the red mark. The other metadata variable is <code>isDirty</code>, which indicates that the page has been modified after it was read from disk.</p>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><pre><code>// PageID is the type of the page identifier
type PageID int

const pageSize = 5

// Page represents a page on disk
type Page struct {
	id       PageID
	pinCount int
	isDirty  bool
	data     [pageSize]byte
}
</code></pre>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><h2 id="the-clock-replacement-algorithm">The Clock Replacement algorithm </h2><p>When the buffer pool is full, and a new page needs to enter the cache, some page needs to be chosen to leave the cache. &nbsp;This is a classic <strong>cache eviction</strong> problem and there is no perfect solution because predicting which pages are going to be requested is a complicated problem. If you can't predict which pages are going to be requested, you don't know which pages must remain in cache and which pages must be evicted. The best you can do is to reduce the number of wrong page evictions. There are many strategies like <strong>FIFO</strong> (f<em>irst-in first-out</em>), <strong>LRU</strong> (<em>least recently used</em>), and <strong>LFU</strong> (<em>least frequently used</em>). We are not going to explore all of them and their trade-offs. For our buffer pool manager implementation, we have chosen one policy called <strong>CLOCK</strong>.</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>When a thread from the execution engine no longer needs a page, it calls the <code>UnpinPage</code> method from the buffer pool. This method reduces the <code>pinCount</code> of the page, and if the pin count reaches zero, the <code>frame id</code> of where that page allocated is stored in the <strong>Clock Replacer</strong> for future analysis. If, anytime, the same page is accessed again (its pin count increases), and it needs to be removed from the <strong>Clock Replacer</strong>.</p>
<p>The <strong>Clock Replacer</strong> keeps tracks of all pages that are not being accessed in a <strong>circular buffer</strong>. For each page, it also keeps a <strong>reference bit</strong> to indicate if the page was recently accessed. There is a <strong>Clock Hand</strong> or <strong>Clock Pointer</strong> (CP) that iterates through the circular buffer looking for a <em>victim</em>.</p>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><figure><img src="https://brunocalza.me/content/images/2021/02/image-4.png" alt=""><figcaption>Clock Replacer representation&nbsp;</figcaption></figure><p>The <strong>Clock Replacer </strong>provides the following <strong>API</strong>:</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><pre><code>func Victim() *FrameID
func Unpin(id FrameID)
func Pin(id FrameID) 
</code></pre>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><ul>
<li><strong><code>Unpin</code></strong> is called when the buffer pool wants to make a page eligible for eviction because it is no longer accessed;</li>
<li><strong><code>Pin</code></strong> is called when the buffer pool wants to remove a page from cache eviction election because it was accessed and it cannot be evicted;</li>
<li><strong><code>Victim</code></strong> elects a victim through the clock replacement policy.</li>
</ul>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>Let's see how the clock replacement policy works using an example.</p>
<p>The state of the Clock Replacer after the calls <code>Unpin(1)</code>, <code>Unpin(2)</code> and <code>Unpin(3)</code>.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div aria-label="Content"> <div> <article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting">  <div id="post-content" itemprop="articleBody"> <p>You know how it happens.</p> <p>You see someone from the Product team coming to your desk and your heart starts to sink. Then the inevitable question comes:</p> <blockquote> <p>hey, how did the sale go? How many items did we sell compared to last year’s? Is there a chance we could compare on an hourly basis how much we sold compared to any given Friday?</p> </blockquote> <p>You don’t have a straight answer and you don’t have a quick way to tell them; your transactions table in postgres has grown way too big to handle analytical queries. It could take minutes to even get a <code>SELECT count(*) FROM transactions</code> going.</p> <p>We at Tinybird love PostgreSQL. We have been working with it for longer than we can remember and we know its insides and outs better than most; it is our go to RDBMS system for building data intensive applications and the one we recommend to pretty much anyone who asks.</p> <p>But when your tables start hitting the tens of millions of rows, the hundreds of millions… Yes, you can create or fine tune indices to keep serving your application requests; yes, you can set replication up so that you can at least run the analytical queries against the replicas instead of against the main database; yes, you can resort to running recurring pre-aggregation queries that then dump a reduced (and poorer) set of data somewhere else so that you can exploit it through whatever BI your Product team chose.</p> <p>But all of that is costly and none of it is ideal. We can offer a way to cut through all that stuff.</p> <blockquote> <p>Because none of that gives you the ability to use the full power of SQL to run instant queries against all of your data; none of that enables you to retain the flexibility of cutting and slicing ALL of your data any which way you want and to make the most of it.</p> </blockquote> <p>What if we told you that, with a single cron job, you can be running analytical queries of your large postgres tables in less than it takes you to run a <code>SELECT count(*)</code> against any of them?</p> <p>Yep, it is possible; only it wouldn’t use Postgres to actually run the analytical queries but Tinybird. This is what the command would look like:</p> <div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
3
</pre></td><td><pre>psql -U {USER} -c \
"COPY (select * from transactions where insertion_date = CURRENT_DATE - 1) to STDOUT WITH CSV HEADER" | \
curl -F csv=@- "https://api.tinybird.co/v0/datasources?name=transactions&amp;mode=append&amp;token={TOKEN}"
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div> <p>And here is how to setup your crontab to run the job at midnight every night:</p> <div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
</pre></td><td><pre>0 0 * * * [user] psql -U {USER} -c "COPY (select * from transactions where insertion_date = CURRENT_DATE - 1) to STDOUT WITH CSV HEADER" | curl -F csv=@- "https://api.tinybird.co/v0/datasources?name=transactions&amp;mode=append&amp;token={TOKEN}"
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div> <p>You might want to do this every 5 minutes, a little bit more complex but still a piece of cake, you just need to query for the insertion time.</p> <div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
</pre></td><td><pre>0/5 * * * * [user] psql -U {USER} -c "COPY (select * from transactions where created_at &gt; '`curl -s "https://api.tinybird.co/v0/sql?q=select+max(created_at)+from+transactions&amp;token={TOKEN}"`') to STDOUT WITH CSV HEADER" | curl -F csv=@- "https://api.tinybird.co/v0/datasources?name=transactions&amp;mode=append&amp;token={TOKEN}"
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div> <p>And that’s that… You now have an always-up-to-date replica of your transactions table and can start querying it with sub-second times.</p> <p>To make this painless, it’d be good to have an index on insertion_date on your Postgres table; in this case we recommend BRIN index which is compact, suited for append-only tables and pretty fast for these use cases. You could use the following command (bear in mind BRIN index only works when data in disk correlates with the order of the data)</p> <div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
</pre></td><td><pre>create index created_at_idx on orders using brin (created_at);
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div> <p>Tinybird can ingest records as fast as you can feed them through your network (all the way up to 4Gb/per minute depending on the network speed), so as long as your Postgres db can spit it out, we can take it.</p> <p>You can then login to Tinybird’s UI and start issuing queries in seconds. Or setup a KPIs dashboard using our APIs.</p> <p>Oh! And those queries your Product team was asking about? Here’s how fast they run against a 100M rows table.</p> <p>The upload takes about 5 minutes for these 100M rows (2Gb compressed). Basically is limited by the network and postgres export speed, so it might vary depending on your machine and how close your datacenter is to ours (Google in different regions in our case)</p> <p>Let’s see some simple examples to see the point where it pays off waiting 5 minutes to upload the whole dataset. All the queries are running PostgreSQL 11.5 with 6 cores per query on a 32Gb machine (16gb shared buffers). The times reported here are the best of many executions.</p> <h2 id="count-per-shipping-method">Count per shipping method</h2> <div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1

<p>In this blog post I will share how to generate text to image in Go programming language (Golang). I have previous and similar blog post using Python. You can check that post <a href="https://johnpili.com/generate-text-to-image-in-python/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>.</p>
<p>The reasons why I created this application is for me to share text content like<strong> Linux configuration</strong> and <strong>source code snippet</strong> in WhatsApp or other messaging application. Another is to generate featured image for social media posts in Twitter, Facebook or LinkedIn.</p>

<p>To start drawing, I created a rectangular area that will represent the boundary of my image. The code:</p>
<pre>image.NewRGBA(image.Rect(0, 0, 1200, 630))</pre>
<p>does that. This statement creates a rectangle from point(0,0) to point(1200, 630).</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><article><section><div id="content">

<p>
I'm planning on pivoting away from pure software, and this post is meant as
a sort of explanation and rationale for the choices I'm about to make.
</p>

<p>
Over the last few years working in the software industry, I realized that pure software
work is just boring. What's worse, much of the work in this industry seems to be pretty useless,
if not even <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_advertising">detrimental to society</a>. Code is a powerful tool for making this world
better, and yet I'm having a hard time seeing it used that way.
</p>

<p>
If code is a tool, then it's a means to an end. A carpenter is not an expert in using a hammer - they're
an expert in using a hammer <i>to build something useful</i>. I'm increasingly feeling more
like a hammer expert in an industry of selling modern nail art, and so I think it's time to focus on developing
expertise in some other fields, where I could use computing to create things I believe in.
</p>

<p>
There are two areas of human endeavor that I've been dreaming about for a long time now,
and I want to make a serious effort to contribute to them. I'm thinking
of switching over my career to one (or both) of them over the coming few years.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-org7712ef1">
<h2 id="org7712ef1">Space</h2>
<div id="text-org7712ef1">
<p>
I find space intrinsically interesting. I've dreamed of humans exploring the universe
since I was a kid.
</p>

<p>
I believe that expanding outwards, and moving various industries from the surface
to Earth orbit and further out, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ab_mH8R0KTM">could usher a new era of prosperity for humans</a>.
It could also play a vital part in restoring the damage we've been doing to our home
for the past three centuries.
</p>

<p>
Space programs worldwide have become quite neglected since the end of the Apollo era,
but in the last decade - in big part thanks to the private sector, now dubbed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NewSpace">NewSpace</a> - 
things have been picking up pace. Still, development happens too slow for my taste,
and I would love to give my best to push it forward ever so slightly, so that maybe
humanity will become a real spacefaring species within my lifetime.
</p>

<p>
Ultimately, my dream is to directly contribute towards bootstrapping
an industry in space - that is, to work on things related to asteroid mining, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_situ_resource_utilization">ISRU</a>, zero-G manufacturing,
or many of other supporting areas.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgcae13bd">
<h2 id="orgcae13bd">Biotech</h2>
<div id="text-orgcae13bd">
<p>
I believe <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engines_of_Creation">Eric Drexler when he writes that</a> molecular nanotechnology pretty much the key to the future.
Mastery of nano-scale processes could literally solve half of the problems humanity faces (i.e. the
half we don't inflict on ourselves). And as I'm fond of saying:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Life <i>is technology</i>. It is very advanced nanotech that we didn't design, and we can't control… <i>yet</i>. 
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Biotech of today is finally letting us tinker with existing machines that work on molecular scale, and
gain necessary experience to design our own nanosystems. I think that modifying and ultimately reverse-engineering
an existing, working technology is much simpler than developing our own - but even if not, it's currently
our only example of working nanomachinery to study.
</p>

<p>
To be clear - I was never particularly interested in living things by themselves. I have no passion
for flowers and animals, and I prefer concrete jungle to a raw forest. But I love engineering of all
kinds, and it is with this view that I feel drawn towards biology. My dream is to work on things
that help us design our own nanomachines for use in making lives of everyone better.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org3c570b8">
<h2 id="org3c570b8">Doing it</h2>
<div id="text-org3c570b8">
<p>
While I've been paying attention to both spacetech and biotech for a long time,
it's only in the past year or two that I really started considering a serious career switch. I could just
resign from my current software job and try to get hired by anyone in my industries of choice, but that
feels both irresponsible and like a waste of time.
</p>

<p>
Instead, I want to spend the year 2018 on getting the "lay of the land" of both spacetech and biotech
industries - to figure out who is working on what areas, what work is impactful, and what kind of skills
are needed to contribute something meaningful. And while I hate this word, I know I need to spend
some effort on networking.
</p>

<p>
If you, dear reader, have any experience in either of those industries or maybe tips to share,
I would <a href="http://jacek.zlydach.pl/contact.html">very much appreciate some help</a> in getting my bearings.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org489f69c">
<h2 id="org489f69c">But what about…?</h2>

<div id="outline-container-org26e7938">
<h3 id="org26e7938">Lisp</h3>
<p>
It's still my personal tool of choice, and I plan to remain active in Common Lisp community.
I will keep using it wherever I can, but I'm more practical about it than I used
to be a few years ago.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org4d6b72f">
<h3 id="org4d6b72f">Game development</h3>
<p>
It's fun as a pastime, but I don't feel like I want to make a career in it anymore.
I'll probably keep writing small games as a pure hobby.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org7179f89">
<h3 id="org7179f89">AI</h3>
<p>
I pay attention to both the more hype-driven areas like deep learning, and those more dream-driven,
like the work of <a href="https://intelligence.org/">MIRI</a> and <a href="https://openai.com/">OpenAI</a>. However, I don't feel like focusing on those particular areas right now,
beyond picking up basic skills in machine learning. If an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_general_intelligence">AGI</a> takes off and renders all our endeavors obsolete,
only better for us. If it decides to kill us all, it at least won't be because of a software bug I made.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgc684c0f">
<h3 id="orgc684c0f">Cleantech, energy</h3>
<p>
Energy problems are constantly on my mind, and I have some interest in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clean_technology">cleantech</a>. A possible future pivot
into that industry isn't beyond my imagination, but as it is, I feel that both spacetech and biotech
can offer a lot in terms of solutions for energy and climate problems, so my current choice is tangentially
related.

<p>Many claim: "Reliable video conferencing? Only big companies in Silicon Valley can do that". But these companies are repeatedly criticised for endangering our privacy and the security of our computers.</p>
<p>As students in Darmstadt and Karlsruhe, we were forced by our universities to use the applications of such companies. That's why we want to show that video communication for digital family visits, web seminars, teaching and conferences also works with data protection. With Senfcall we offer videoconferencing via the open source software <a href="https://bigbluebutton.org/">BigBlueButton™</a>. The advantage: to use Senfcall you only need your web browser - no additional software that creates new security holes.</p>
<p>So that you can also use privacy protecting video conferences.</p>

    <p><em>Posted on January 30, 2021
    
        by Thomas Mahler
    </em></p></div>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Quite a while back I wrote a larger article on the algebraic foundation of software patterns which also covered the <a href="https://thma.github.io/posts/2018-11-24-lambda-the-ultimate-pattern-factory.html#map-reduce">MapReduce algorithm</a>.</p>
<p>During the research digged out a paper on <a href="https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/0498/3a1c0d6343e21129aaffca2a1b3eec419523.pdf">algebraic properties of distributed big data analytics</a>, which explained that a MapReduce will always work correctly when the intermediate data structure resulting from the <code>map</code>-phase is a Monoid under the <code>reduce</code>-operation.</p>
<p>For some reason, I was not convinced that this Monoid-condition was enough, because all the typical examples like word-frequency maps are even <strong>commutative</strong> Monoids under the respective reduce operation.</p>
<p>So I came up with the following personal theory:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Only if the intermediate data structure resulting from the <code>map</code>-phase is a <strong>commutative Monoid</strong> under the <code>reduce</code>-operation, then a parallel MapReduce will produce correct results.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I tried to validate this property using the <a href="https://wiki.haskell.org/Introduction_to_QuickCheck2">QuickCheck test framework</a>.</p>
<p>Interestingly the QuickCheck tests failed! This finally convinced me that my theory was wrong, and after a little deeper thought, I could understand why.</p>
<p>I was impressed with the power of QuickCheck, so I thought it would be a good idea to share this lesson in falsification.</p>
<p>The code shown in this blog <a href="https://github.com/thma/CommutativeMonoid">is also available on GitHub</a></p>
<h2 id="commutative-monoids">Commutative Monoids</h2>
<p>In abstract algebra, a monoid is a <em>set</em> equipped with an <em>associative binary operation</em> and an <em>identity element</em>.</p>
<p>The simplest example for a <em>commutative Monoid</em> is <span>\((\mathbb{N}_0, +, 0)\)</span>: the natural numbers under addition with <span>\(0\)</span> as the identity (or neutral) element. We can use QuickCheck to verify that indeed the Monoid laws plus commutativity are maintained.</p>
<p>If we want to use <code>GHC.Natural</code> type to represent natural numbers, we first have to make <code>Natural</code> instantiate the <code>Arbitrary</code> type class which is used by QuickCheck to automatically generate test data:</p>
<div id="cb1"><pre><code><span id="cb1-1"><span>import</span>           <span>Test.QuickCheck</span> (<span>Arbitrary</span>, arbitrary, <span>NonNegative</span> (..))</span>
<span id="cb1-2"><span>import</span>           <span>GHC.Natural</span>     (<span>Natural</span>, naturalFromInteger)</span>
<span id="cb1-3"></span>
<span id="cb1-4"><span>instance</span> <span>Arbitrary</span> <span>Natural</span> <span>where</span></span>
<span id="cb1-5">  arbitrary <span>=</span> <span>do</span></span>
<span id="cb1-6">    <span>NonNegative</span> nonNegative <span>&lt;-</span> arbitrary</span>
<span id="cb1-7">    <span>return</span> <span>$</span> naturalFromInteger nonNegative</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Now we can start to write our property based tests. For algebraic structures it is straightforward to come up with properties: we just write the required laws (associativity, 0 is identity element and commutativity) as properties.</p>
<p>I am using Hspec as a wrapper around QuickCheck as it provides a very nice testing DSL which makes it easy to read the code and the output of the test suite:</p>
<div id="cb2"><pre><code><span id="cb2-1"><span>import</span>           <span>Test.Hspec</span></span>
<span id="cb2-2"></span>
<span id="cb2-3"><span>spec ::</span> <span>Spec</span></span>
<span id="cb2-4">spec <span>=</span> <span>do</span></span>
<span id="cb2-5">  describe <span>"The Monoid 'Natural Numbers under Addition'"</span> <span>$</span> <span>do</span></span>
<span id="cb2-6">    it <span>"is associative"</span> <span>$</span></span>
<span id="cb2-7">      property <span>$</span> \x y z <span>-&gt;</span> ((x <span>+</span> y) <span>+</span> z) <span>`shouldBe`</span> ((x <span>+</span> (y <span>+</span> z))<span> ::</span> <span>Natural</span>)</span>
<span id="cb2-8">      </span>
<span id="cb2-9">    it <span>"has 0 as left and right identity element"</span> <span>$</span></span>
<span id="cb2-10">      property <span>$</span> \x <span>-&gt;</span> (x <span>+</span> <span>0</span> <span>`shouldBe`</span> (<span>x ::</span> <span>Natural</span>)) <span>.&amp;&amp;.</span> (<span>0</span> <span>+</span> x <span>`shouldBe`</span> x)</span>
<span id="cb2-11">      </span>
<span id="cb2-12">    it <span>"is commutative"</span> <span>$</span></span>
<span id="cb2-13">      property <span>$</span> \x y <span>-&gt;</span> x <span>+</span> y <span>`shouldBe`</span> (y <span>+</span><span> x ::</span> <span>Natural</span>)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>The output of these tests will be as follows:</p>
<div id="cb3"><pre><code><span id="cb3-1"><span>Monoid</span></span>
<span id="cb3-2">  <span>The</span> Monoid <span>'Natural Numbers under Addition'</span></span>
<span id="cb3-3">    <span>is</span> associative</span>
<span id="cb3-4">      <span>+++</span> OK, passed 100 tests.</span>
<span id="cb3-5">    <span>has</span> 0 as identity (or neutral) <span>element</span></span>
<span id="cb3-6">      <span>+++</span> OK, passed 100 tests.</span>
<span id="cb3-7">    <span>is</span> commutative</span>
<span id="cb3-8">      <span>+++</span> OK, passed 100 tests.</span></code></pre></div>
<p>So behind the scenes, QuickCheck has generated test data for 100 tests for each property under test. For all these data the test cases passed.</p>
<p>This is definitely not a proof. But it gives us some confidence that our math text-books are correct when giving Natural Numbers under addition as an example for a commutative Monoid.</p>
<p>OK, that was easy! Now let’s move to non-commutative Monoids.</p>
<h2 id="non-commutative-monoids">Non-commutative Monoids</h2>
<p>Strings (or any other Lists) under concatenation are a typical example. It’s easy to see that <code>"hello" ++ ("dear" ++ "people")</code> equals <code>"(hello" ++ "dear") ++ "people"</code>, but that <code>"hello" ++ "world"</code> differs from <code>"world" ++ "hello"</code>.</p>
<p>Now let’s try to formalize these intuitions as QuickCheck property based tests again.</p>
<p>First I’m introducing an alias for <code>(++)</code>, as it is defined on any list type, it would be required to have type signatures in all properties (as we had all those <code>:: Natural</code> signatures in the examples above). So I define an operation <code>(⊕)</code> which is only defined on <code>String</code> instances:</p>
<div id="cb4"><pre><code><span id="cb4-1">(⊕)<span> ::</span> <span>String</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>String</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>String</span></span>
<span id="cb4-2">(⊕) a b <span>=</span> a <span>++</span> b</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Now we can extend our test suite with the following test cases:</p>
<div id="cb5"><pre><code><span id="cb5-1">  describe <span>"The Monoid 'Strings under concatenation'"</span> <span>$</span> <span>do</span></span>
<span id="cb5-2">    </span>
<span id="cb5-3">    it <span>"is associative"</span> <span>$</span> </span>
<span id="cb5-4">      property <span>$</span> \x y z <span>-&gt;</span> ((x ⊕ y) ⊕ z) <span>`shouldBe`</span> (x ⊕ (y ⊕ z))</span>
<span id="cb5-5">      </span>
<span id="cb5-6">    it <span>"has \"\" as left and right identity element"</span> <span>$</span></span>
<span id="cb5-7">      property <span>$</span> \x <span>-&gt;</span> (x ⊕ <span>""</span> <span>`shouldBe`</span> x) <span>.&amp;&amp;.</span> (<span>""</span> ⊕ x <span>`shouldBe`</span> x)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>The output looks promising:</p>
<div id="cb6"><pre><code><span id="cb6-1">  <span>The</span> Monoid <span>'Strings under concatenation'</span></span>
<span id="cb6-2">    <span>is</span> associative</span>
<span id="cb6-3">      <span>+++</span> OK, passed 100 tests.</span>
<span id="cb6-4">    <span>has</span> <span>""</span> as left and right identity element</span>
<span id="cb6-5">      <span>+++</span> OK, passed 100 tests.</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Now let’s try to test the non-commutativity:</p>
<div id="cb7"><pre><code><span id="cb7-1">    it <span>"is NOT commutative"</span> <span>$</span></span>
<span id="cb7-2">      property <span>$</span> \x y <span>-&gt;</span> x ⊕ y <span>`shouldNotBe`</span> y ⊕ x</span></code></pre></div>
<p>But unfortunately the output tells us that this is not true:</p>
<div id="cb8"><pre><code><span id="cb8-1">    <span>is</span> NOT commutative FAILED [1]</span>
<span id="cb8-2"></span>
<span id="cb8-3">  <span>1</span>) <span>Monoid</span>, The Monoid <span>'Strings under concatenation'</span>, is NOT commutative</span>
<span id="cb8-4">       <span>Falsifiable</span> (after 1 test)<span>:</span></span>
<span id="cb8-5">         <span>""</span></span>
<span id="cb8-6">         <span>""</span></span>
<span id="cb8-7">       <span>not</span> expected: <span>""</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>We formulated the property in the wrong way. The <code>(⊕)</code> <em>may be commutative for some</em> edge cases, e.g.&nbsp;when one or both of the arguments are <code>""</code>. But it is not commutative <em>in general</em> – that is for all possible arguments.</p>
<p>We could rephrase this property as <em>“There exists at least one pair of arguments <span>\((x, y)\)</span> for which <span>\(\oplus\)</span> is not commutative”</em>:</p>
<p><span>\[\exists (x,y) \left [  x \oplus y \neq y \oplus x \right ]\]</span></p>
<p>QuickCheck does not come with a mechanism for <em>existential quantification</em>. But as is has <code>forAll</code>, that is <em>universal quantification</em>. So we can try to make use of the following equivalence:</p>
<p><span>\[\exists (x,y) \left [  x \oplus y \neq y \oplus x \right ] 
  \equiv 
  \neg \forall (x,y) \left [ x \oplus y = y \oplus x \right ]\]</span></p>
<p>Unfortunately we can not write this simply as <code>not forAll</code>, as <code>forAll</code> returns a <code>Property</code> but <code>not</code> expects a <code>Bool</code>. But as explained in <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42764847/is-there-a-there-exists-quantifier-in-quickcheck">this discussion on Stackoverflow</a> it is still posible to implement our own <code>exists</code>:</p>
<div id="cb9"><pre><code><span id="cb9-1"><span>exists ::</span> (<span>Show</span> a, <span>Arbitrary</span> a) <span>=&gt;</span> (a <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Bool</span>) <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Property</span></span>
<span id="cb9-2">exists <span>=</span> forSome <span>$</span> resize <span>1000</span> arbitrary</span>
<span id="cb9-3"></span>
<span id="cb9-4"><span>forSome ::</span> (<span>Show</span> a, <span>Testable</span> prop) <span>=&gt;</span> <span>Gen</span> a <span>-&gt;</span> (a <span>-&gt;</span> prop) <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Property</span></span>
<span id="cb9-5">forSome gen prop <span>=</span></span>
<span id="cb9-6">  mapResult (\r <span>-&gt;</span> r {P.reason <span>=</span> <span>"No witness found."</span>, P.callbacks <span>=</span> []}) <span>$</span></span>
<span id="cb9-7">    once <span>$</span> disjoin <span>$</span> <span>replicate</span> <span>1000</span> <span>$</span> forAll gen prop</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Now we can rewrite the property <span>\(\exists (x,y) \left [ x \oplus y \neq y \oplus x \right ]\)</span> as follows:</p>
<div id="cb10"><pre><code><span id="cb10-1">    it <span>"is not commutative (via exists)"</span> <span>$</span></span>
<span id="cb10-2">      exists <span>$</span> \(x,y) <span>-&gt;</span> x ⊕ y <span>/=</span> y ⊕ x</span></code></pre></div>
<p>I like how close the Haskell code stays to the concise mathematical formulation! The output of this test fits much better into our intuitive understanding:</p>
<div id="cb11"><pre><code><span id="cb11-1">    <span>is</span> not commutative (via exists)</span>
<span id="cb11-2">      <span>+++</span> OK, passed 1 test.</span></code></pre></div>
<h2 id="sequential-mapreduce">Sequential MapReduce</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>MapReduce is a programming model and an associated implementation for processing and generating large data sets. Users specify <strong>a map function</strong> that processes a key/value pair to generate a set of intermediate key/value pairs, <strong>and a reduce function</strong> that merges all intermediate values associated with the same intermediate key.</p>
<p>[This] abstraction is inspired by the map and reduce primitives present in Lisp and many other functional languages. <a href="https://storage.googleapis.com/pub-tools-public-publication-data/pdf/16cb30b4b92fd4989b8619a61752a2387c6dd474.pdf">Quoted from Google Research</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I’m not going into more details here, as You’ll find detailed information on this approach and a working example <a href="https://thma.github.io/posts/2018-11-24-lambda-the-ultimate-pattern-factory.html#map-reduce">in my original article</a>.</p>
<p>Here is the definition of a sequential MapReduce:</p>
<div id="cb12"><pre><code><span id="cb12-1">simpleMapReduce </span>
<span id="cb12-2"><span>  ::</span> (a <span>-&gt;</span> b)   <span>-- map function</span></span>
<span id="cb12-3">  <span>-&gt;</span> ([b] <span>-&gt;</span> c) <span>-- reduce function</span></span>
<span id="cb12-4">  <span>-&gt;</span> [a]        <span>-- list to map over</span></span>
<span id="cb12-5">  <span>-&gt;</span> c          <span>-- result</span></span>
<span id="cb12-6">simpleMapReduce mapFunc reduceFunc <span>=</span> reduceFunc <span>.</span> <span>map</span> mapFunc</span></code></pre></div>
<p>We can test the sequential MapReduce algorithm with the following property based test:</p>
<div id="cb13"><pre><code><span id="cb13-1">    it <span>"works correctly with a sequential map-reduce"</span> <span>$</span></span>
<span id="cb13-2">      property <span>$</span> \a b c d <span>-&gt;</span> (simpleMapReduce <span>reverse</span> (<span>foldr</span> (⊕) <span>""</span>) [a,b,c,d]) </span>
<span id="cb13-3">                     <span>`shouldBe`</span> (<span>reverse</span> a) ⊕ (<span>reverse</span> b) ⊕ (<span>reverse</span> c) ⊕ (<span>reverse</span> d)</span></code></pre></div>
<h3 id="excurs-foldmap">Excurs: foldMap</h3>
<p>What I have shown so far just demonstrates the general mechanism of chaining <code>map</code> and <code>reduce</code> functions without implying any parallel execution. Essentially we are chaining a <code>map</code> with a <code>fold</code> (i.e.&nbsp;reduction) function. In the Haskell base library there is a higher order function <code>foldMap</code> that covers exactly this pattern of chaining. Please note that <code>foldMap</code>does only a single traversal of the foldable data structure. It fuses the <code>map</code> and <code>reduce</code> phase into a single one by function composition of <code>mappend</code> and the mapping function <code>f</code>:</p>
<div id="cb14"><pre><code><span id="cb14-1"><span>-- | Map each element of the structure to a monoid,</span></span>
<span id="cb14-2"><span>-- and combine the results.</span></span>
<span id="cb14-3"><span>foldMap</span><span> ::</span> (<span>Foldable</span> t, <span>Monoid</span> m) <span>=&gt;</span> (a <span>-&gt;</span> m) <span>-&gt;</span> t a <span>-&gt;</span> m</span>
<span id="cb14-4"><span>foldMap</span> f <span>=</span> <span>foldr</span> (<span>mappend</span> <span>.</span> f) <span>mempty</span></span></code></pre></div>
<h2 id="parallel-mapreduce">Parallel MapReduce</h2>
<p>Now we come to the tricky part that kicked off this whole discussion: parallelism.</p>
<p>As an example we consider a simple sequential MapReduce, taking an input list of <code>Int</code>s, computing their squares and computing the sum of these squares:</p>
<div id="cb15"><pre><code><span id="cb15-1">λ<span>&gt;</span> simpleMapReduce (<span>^</span><span>2</span>) (<span>foldr</span> (<span>+</span>) <span>0</span>) [<span>1</span>,<span>2</span>,<span>3</span>,<span>4</span>]</span>
<span id="cb15-2"><span>30</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>Let’s try to design this as a massively parallelized algorithm:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Mapping of <code>(^2)</code> over the input-list <code>[1,2,3,4]</code> would be started in parallel to the reduction of the intermediary list of squares by <code>(foldr (+) 0)</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>The mapping phase will be executed as a set of parallel computations (one for each element of the input list).</p></li>
<li><p>The reduction phase will also be executed as a set of parallel computations (one for each addition).</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Of course the reduction phase can begin only when at least one list element is squared. So in effect the mapping process would have to start first. The parallel computation of squares will result in a non-deterministic sequence of computations. In particular it is not guaranteed that all elements of the input list are processed in the original list order. So it might for example …</p></div></div>

<p>Hey readers!</p>
<p>I've open-sourced new <a href="https://github.com/trekhleb/machine-learning-experiments">🤖 Interactive Machine Learning Experiments</a> project on GitHub. Each experiment consists of 🏋️ <em>Jupyter/Colab notebook</em> (to see how a model was trained) and 🎨 <em>demo page</em> (to see a model in action right in your browser).</p>
<p>Although the models may be a little dumb (remember, these are just experiments, not a production ready code), they will try to do their best to:</p>
<ul>
<li>🖌 Recognize digits or sketches you draw in your browser</li>
<li>📸 Detect and recognize the objects you'll show to your camera</li>
<li>🌅 Classify your uploaded image</li>
<li>📝 Write a Shakespeare poem with you</li>
<li>✊🖐✌️ Play with you in Rock-Paper-Scissors game</li>
<li>etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>I've trained the models on <em>Python</em> using <em>TensorFlow 2</em> with <em>Keras</em> support  and then consumed them for a demo in a browser using <em>React</em> and <em>JavaScript</em> version of <em>Tensorflow</em>.</p>

<p>⚠️ First, let's set our expectations.️ The repository contains machine learning <strong>experiments</strong> and <strong>not</strong> a production ready, reusable, optimised and fine-tuned code and models. This is rather a sandbox or a playground for learning and trying different machine learning approaches, algorithms and data-sets. Models might not perform well and there is a place for overfitting/underfitting.</p>
<p>Therefore, sometimes you might see things like this:</p>

      <span></span>

    </span></p>
<p>But be patient, sometimes the model might get smarter 🤓 and give you this:</p>

<p>I'm a <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/trekhleb/">software engineer</a> and for the last several years now I've been doing mostly frontend and backend programming. In my spare time, as a hobby, I decided to dig into machine learning topics to make it less <em>like magic</em> and <em>more like math</em> to myself.</p>
<ol>
<li>🗓 Since <strong>Python</strong> might be a good choice to start experimenting with Machine Learning I decided to learn its basic syntax first. As a result a <a href="https://github.com/trekhleb/learn-python">🐍 Playground and Cheatsheet for Learning Python</a> project came out. This was just to practice Python and at the same time to have a cheatsheet of basic syntax once I need it (for things like <code>dict_via_comprehension = {x: x**2 for x in (2, 4, 6)}</code> etc.).</li>
<li>🗓 After learning a bit of Python I wanted to dig into the basic <strong>math</strong> behind Machine Learning. So after passing an awesome <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning">Machine Learning course by Andrew Ng</a> on Coursera the <a href="https://github.com/trekhleb/homemade-machine-learning">🤖 Homemade Machine Learning</a> project came out. This time it was about creating a cheatsheet for basic machine learning math algorithms like linear regression, logistic regression, k-means, multilayer perceptron etc.</li>
<li>🗓 The next attempt to play around with basic Machine Learning math was <a href="https://github.com/trekhleb/nano-neuron">🤖 NanoNeuron</a>. It was about 7 simple JavaScript functions that supposed to give you a feeling of how machines can actually "learn".</li>
<li>🗓 After finishing yet another awesome <a href="https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning">Deep Learning Specialization by Andrew Ng</a> on Coursera I decided to practice a bit more with <strong>multilayer perceptrons</strong>, <strong>convolutional</strong> and <strong>recurrent neural networks</strong> (CNNs and RNNs). This time instead of implementing everything from scratch I decided to start using some machine learning framework. I ended up using <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/">TensorFlow 2</a> with <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/keras/overview">Keras</a>. I also didn't want to focus too much on math (letting the framework do it for me) and instead I wanted to come up with something more practical, applicable and something I could try to play with right in my browser. As a result new <a href="https://github.com/trekhleb/machine-learning-experiments">🤖 Interactive Machine Learning Experiments</a> came out that I want to describe a bit more here.</li>

<h3 id="models-training">Models training<a href="#models-training" aria-label="models training permalink"></a></h3>
<ul>
<li>🏋🏻‍ I used <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/keras/overview">Keras</a> inside <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/">TensorFlow 2</a> for modelling and training. Since I had zero experience with machine learning frameworks, I needed to start with something. One of the selling points in favor of TensorFlow was that it has both Python and <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/js">JavaScript flavor</a> of the library with similar API. So eventually I used Python version for training and JavaScript version for demos.</li>
<li>🏋🏻‍ I trained TensorFlow models on Python inside <a href="https://jupyter.org/">Jupyter</a> notebooks locally and sometimes used <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/">Colab</a> to make the training faster on GPU.</li>
<li>💻 Most of the models were trained on good old MacBook's Pro CPU (2,9 GHz Dual-Core Intel Core i5).</li>
<li>🔢 Of course there is no way you could run away from <a href="https://numpy.org/">NumPy</a> for matrix/tensors operations.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="models-demo">Models demo<a href="#models-demo" aria-label="models demo permalink"></a></h3>
<ul>
<li>🏋🏻‍ I used <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/js">TensorFlow.js</a> to do predictions with previously trained models.</li>
<li>♻️ To convert <em>Keras HDF5</em> models to <em>TensorFlow.js Layers</em> format I used <a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs/tree/master/tfjs-converter">TensorFlow.js converter</a>. This might be inefficient to transfer the whole model (megabytes of data) to the browser instead of making predictions through HTTP requests, but again, remember that these are just experiments and not production-ready code and architecture. I wanted to avoid having a dedicated back-end service to make architecture simpler.</li>
<li>👨🏻‍🎨 The <a href="http://trekhleb.github.io/machine-learning-experiments">Demo application</a> was created on <a href="https://reactjs.org/">React</a> using <a href="https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app">create-react-app</a> starter with a default <a href="https://flow.org/en/">Flow</a> flavour for type checking.</li>
<li>💅🏻 For styling, I used <a href="https://material-ui.com/">Material UI</a>. It was, as they say, "to kill two birds" at once and try out a new styling framework (sorry, <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a> 🤷🏻‍).</li>

<p>As I've mentioned above the main purpose of <a href="https://github.com/trekhleb/machine-learning-experiments">the repository</a> is to be more like a playground for learning rather than for production-ready models. Therefore, the main plan is to <strong>continue learning and experimenting</strong> with deep-learning challenges and approaches. The next interesting challenges to play with might be:</p>
<ul>
<li>Emotions detection</li>
<li>Style transfer</li>
<li>Language translation</li>
<li>Generating images (i.e. handwritten numbers)</li>
<li>etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>Another interesting opportunity would be to <strong>tune existing models to make them more performant</strong>. I believe it might give a better understanding of how to overcome overfitting and underfitting and what to do with the model if it just stuck on <code>60%</code> accuracy level for both training and validation sets and doesn't want to improve anymore 🤔.</p>
<p>Anyways, I hope you might find some useful insights for models training from <a href="https://github.com/trekhleb/machine-learning-experiments">the repository</a> or at least to have some fun playing around with the demos!</p>
<p>Happy learning! 🤖</p></div></div>]]>

  <em>a 21 minute read (and <a href="https://github.com/bogo/arm64-to-sim">sources</a>) by <a href="https://twitter.com/giertler">Bogo Giertler</a></em>

<p>The screenshot above looks perfectly normal - until you realize that the sample app running on this M1 MacBook is actually a legacy Spotify SDK demo from 2017. Its proprietary binary framework has never been rebuilt to support M1 Macs and cannot run on Apple’s newest computers, unless Xcode is launched through <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/apple_silicon/about_the_rosetta_translation_environment">Rosetta 2</a>.</p>

<p>If you have an M1 Mac, you probably already encountered this issue. A couple of seconds after hitting Run on your favorite project (and going <em>wow, those M1 Macs sure are fast!</em>), you were likely greeted with this:</p>

<p><img src="https://bogo.wtf/assets/images//Xcode%20Linker%20Error.png" alt="Xcode Linker Error"></p>

<div><div><pre><code>ld: in ../../SpotifyiOS.framework/SpotifyiOS(MPMessagePackReader.o), building for iOS Simulator, but linking in object file built for iOS, file '../../SpotifyiOS.framework/SpotifyiOS' for architecture arm64
clang: error: linker command failed with exit code 1 (use -v to see invocation)
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>In plain English, the proprietary binary framework you’ve been using in your project has not been updated to support iOS Simulator running on M1 Macs. Apple’s advice in this situation is to reach out to the vendor and ask them to release an updated version of the framework - both by migrating it to an XCFramework format, and by rebuilding it to support M1 simulators.</p>

<p>There is a lot of reasons why you might not get your hands on that updated framework anytime soon - or even at all. Commonly, the third-party vendor is slow to react, or you are pinning to a previous major version of the framework for compatibility reasons. Since you likely do not have sources for the original library, you cannot rebuild it yourself either. This means no Simulator builds and no local unit and UI tests. You seemingly hit a dead end and development on an M1 Mac will be very difficult for time being. Or did you?</p>

<p>Last week, I ran into this issue with <a href="https://github.com/spotify/ios-sdk">Spotify’s iOS SDK</a>. With the binary release not updated for over a year, I had to find a way to hack the native ARM64 binary to run in the Simulator. On the way, I learnt a lot about frameworks, binaries, and loaders.  You can find the complete sources for <a href="https://github.com/bogo/arm64-to-sim">arm64-to-sim</a> on GitHub. What follows is a detailed explanation of the ARM64 transmogrification.</p>

<h2 id="-an-idea-takes-root">💡 An Idea Takes Root</h2>
<p>Let’s take a look at the error message again. The error we receive isn’t actually a compiler error - it’s a linker error. <code>ld</code> complains that we are attempting to link in a binary that was compiled for <em>native</em> ARM64 to a binary that is being built for <em>iOS Simulator</em> ARM64.</p>

<p>Historically, the ARM/x86 bifurcation in the Apple product line meant that one could safely assume that code built for <code>i386</code> and <code>x86_64</code> was meant for the Simulator, and code built for <code>armv7</code> and <code>arm64</code> was meant for native devices. This found reflection in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fat_binary">fat (universal) binaries</a> being a widely used hack for distributing frameworks for Apple platforms that could be used both for devices and simulators.</p>

<p>With the release of M1 Macs, this assumption no longer holds true - an ARM64 slice can now be meant for either. Under the guise of supporting macOS, iOS, watchOS, and tvOS in a single framework, in 2019 Apple released a new bundle framework format, <a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2019/416/">XCFramework</a>.</p>

<p>This should give us an idea: since, as indicated by the <code>ld</code> error, we already have a native ARM64 slice in our library, maybe we can repackage it as an iOS Simulator-supporting XCFramework. There is no technical reason why it <em>shouldn’t</em> work - a compiled binary links against symbols of other frameworks and binaries. Since iOS devices and M1 Macs use the same ARM64 instruction set, if the symbols of native and Simulator libraries are sufficiently similar, the library should simply work. We will just need to apply a lot of elbow grease.</p>

<h2 id="-the-anatomy-of-a-xcframework">🫀 The Anatomy of a (XC)Framework</h2>
<p>XCFramework is a pretty straightforward format that is meant to be a drop-in replacement for the original Cocoa Frameworks. Essentially, each XCFramework is a directory containing a property list telling the linker where to find architecture- and plaform-specific copies of each framework.</p>

<p>An example XCFramework looks as follows:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>Example.xcframework/
|-- Info.plist
|-- ios-arm64/
|   +-- Example.framework/
+-- ios-arm64_x86_64-simulator/
    +-- Example.framework/
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The actual mapping of individual frameworks to platforms is done in the <code>Info.plist</code> file. Notice the <code>SupportedArchitectures</code>, <code>SupportedPlatform</code>, and <code>SupportedPlatformVariant</code> properties.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd"&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;plist</span> <span>version=</span><span>"1.0"</span><span>&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;dict&gt;</span>
	<span>&lt;key&gt;</span>AvailableLibraries<span>&lt;/key&gt;</span>
	<span>&lt;array&gt;</span>
		<span>&lt;dict&gt;</span>
			<span>&lt;key&gt;</span>LibraryIdentifier<span>&lt;/key&gt;</span>
			<span>&lt;string&gt;</span>ios-arm64<span>&lt;/string&gt;</span>
			<span>&lt;key&gt;</span>LibraryPath<span>&lt;/key&gt;</span>
			<span>&lt;string&gt;</span>Example.framework<span>&lt;/string&gt;</span>
			<span>&lt;key&gt;</span>SupportedArchitectures<span>&lt;/key&gt;</span>
			<span>&lt;array&gt;</span>
				<span>&lt;string&gt;</span>arm64<span>&lt;/string&gt;</span>
			<span>&lt;/array&gt;</span>
			<span>&lt;key&gt;</span>SupportedPlatform<span>&lt;/key&gt;</span>
			<span>&lt;string&gt;</span>ios<span>&lt;/string&gt;</span>
		<span>&lt;/dict&gt;</span>
		<span>&lt;dict&gt;</span>
			<span>&lt;key&gt;</span>LibraryIdentifier<span>&lt;/key&gt;</span>
			<span>&lt;string&gt;</span>ios-arm64_x86_64-simulator<span>&lt;/string&gt;</span>
			<span>&lt;key&gt;</span>LibraryPath<span>&lt;/key&gt;</span>
			<span>&lt;string&gt;</span>Example.framework<span>&lt;/string&gt;</span>
			<span>&lt;key&gt;</span>SupportedArchitectures<span>&lt;/key&gt;</span>
			<span>&lt;array&gt;</span>
				<span>&lt;string&gt;</span>arm64<span>&lt;/string&gt;</span>
				<span>&lt;string&gt;</span>x86_64<span>&lt;/string&gt;</span>
			<span>&lt;/array&gt;</span>
			<span>&lt;key&gt;</span>SupportedPlatform<span>&lt;/key&gt;</span>
			<span>&lt;string&gt;</span>ios<span>&lt;/string&gt;</span>
			<span>&lt;key&gt;</span>SupportedPlatformVariant<span>&lt;/key&gt;</span>
			<span>&lt;string&gt;</span>simulator<span>&lt;/string&gt;</span>
		<span>&lt;/dict&gt;</span>
	<span>&lt;/array&gt;</span>
	<span>&lt;key&gt;</span>CFBundlePackageType<span>&lt;/key&gt;</span>
	<span>&lt;string&gt;</span>XFWK<span>&lt;/string&gt;</span>
	<span>&lt;key&gt;</span>XCFrameworkFormatVersion<span>&lt;/key&gt;</span>
	<span>&lt;string&gt;</span>1.0<span>&lt;/string&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;/dict&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;/plist&gt;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>After creating a relevant folder structure and dropping in an <code>Info.plist</code> alongside our legacy <code>.framework</code>, we should now have a real <code>.xcframework</code> on our hands. Let’s emplace the original <code>.framework</code> in Xcode with it and try to build. Of course, it would be too easy if it worked - instead, we get the following:</p>

<p><img src="https://bogo.wtf/assets/images//Xcode%20Linker%20Error%20with%20XCFramework.png" alt="Xcode Linker Error - with XCFramework"></p>

<div><div><pre><code>ld: in /Users/bogo/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData/NowPlayingView-aeukgqexpeqlsrdzslkpeehveixs/Build/Products/Debug-iphonesimulator/SpotifyiOS.framework/SpotifyiOS(MPMessagePackReader.o), building for iOS Simulator, but linking in object file built for iOS, file '/Users/bogo/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData/NowPlayingView-aeukgqexpeqlsrdzslkpeehveixs/Build/Products/Debug-iphonesimulator/SpotifyiOS.framework/SpotifyiOS' for architecture arm64
clang: error: linker command failed with exit code 1 (use -v to see invocation)
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Since the Cocoa Framework is coming from <code>DerivedData</code>, we can be sure we assembled our XCFramework correctly. Still, we are back to square one - despite our naïve wrapping, the linker can still tell that we are bringing in a native library. Here’s our new objective: to find a way to convince <code>ld</code> that the library is actually a Simulator library.</p>

<h2 id="️-into-the-binary">🕵️ Into the Binary</h2>

<p>Let’s take a look inside our framework and see what files could be informing it about the platform.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>Example.framework/
|-- Info.plist
|-- Example
|-- Headers/
|   |-- A.h
|   |-- B.h
|   +-- C.h
+-- Modules/
    +-- module.modulemap
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Cursory browsing of the human-readable contents of the framework does not yield any hints, so the linker must be using the contents of the binary file itself to infer the Simulator information. Since, we don’t really know what to look for, let’s dig into the binaries of other XCFrameworks out there first.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/firebase/firebase-ios-sdk/blob/master/Package.swift#L244">FirebaseAnalytics.xcframework</a> is a particularly good XCFramework to investigate - it contains both native and Simulator binaries. The obvious first idea is to search for Simulator references in the human-readable strings of the binary:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span># in the FirebaseAnalytics.xcframework directory</span>
<span>$ </span>strings ios-arm64_i386_x86_64-simulator/FirebaseAnalytics.framework/FirebaseAnalytics | <span>grep</span> <span>-i</span> sim
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The result is a bunch of rather uninteresting strings, none of them mentioning the Simulator. We can make an educated guess that the Simulator information is thus encoded in the machine-readable segment of the binary. To extract it, we can use <code>otool</code> - a tool meant to explore the executable files produced by LLVM. The <code>-fahl</code> parameter prints the relevant  fat, archive, and Mach-O headers, as well as the load commands.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span># in the FirebaseAnalytics.xcframework directory</span>
<span>$ </span>otool <span>-fahl</span> ios-arm64_i386_x86_64-simulator/FirebaseAnalytics.framework/FirebaseAnalytics
<span>(</span>...<span>)</span>
Load <span>command </span>2
      cmd LC_LINKER_OPTIMIZATION_HINT
  cmdsize 16
  dataoff 12464
 datasize 760
Load <span>command </span>3
     cmd LC_SYMTAB
 cmdsize 24
  symoff 13224
   nsyms 201
  stroff 16440
 strsize 5064
<span>(</span>...<span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Whoops, that’s a lot of data! The offsets and addresses and sizes are doing us no good and are likely to be different between platforms. Let’s constrain our search to load commands, save the results, and compare them:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span># in the FirebaseAnalytics.xcframework directory</span>
<span>$ </span>otool <span>-fahl</span> ios-arm64_i386_x86_64-simulator/FirebaseAnalytics.framework/FirebaseAnalytics | <span>grep</span> <span>-E</span> <span>'cmd |\.o'</span> <span>&gt;</span> simulator_cmds

<span>$ </span>otool <span>-fahl</span> ios-arm64_armv7/FirebaseAnalytics.framework/FirebaseAnalytics | <span>grep</span> <span>-E</span> <span>'cmd |\.o'</span> <span>&gt;</span> native_cmds

<span>$ </span>diff <span>-u</span> native_cmds simulator_cmds
<span>-ios-arm64_armv7</span>/FirebaseAnalytics.framework/FirebaseAnalytics<span>(</span>FirebaseAnalytics_vers.o<span>)</span>:
+ios-arm64_i386_x86_64-simulator/FirebaseAnalytics.framework/FirebaseAnalytics<span>(</span>FirebaseAnalytics_vers.o<span>)</span>:
       cmd LC_SEGMENT_64
-      cmd LC_VERSION_MIN_IPHONEOS
+      cmd LC_BUILD_VERSION
      cmd LC_SYMTAB
<span>(</span>...<span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Alright, we got a match! Seems that the Simulator binary contains  an <code>LC_BUILD_VERSION</code> load command, while the native binary contains an <code>LC_VERSION_MIN_IPHONEOS</code> load command in the same place. A pass with <code>otool</code> on our unsupported, native-only <code>.framework</code> confirms this theory. A bit of Googling reveals that <a href="https://reviews.llvm.org/D85358">this specific difference</a> is used by LLDB to distinguish Simulator and native binaries. We are on the right track then - looks like substituting <code>LC_VERSION_MIN_IPHONEOS</code> with <code>LC_BUILD_VERSION</code> might be just enough to fool <code>ld</code>.</p>

<h2 id="-meet-the-librarian">📚 Meet the Librarian</h2>
<p>So far, we’ve been playing with a fat binary, containing multiple platform-specific slices. We can see architectures available in a binary using the <code>file</code> command:</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><span>For the last few days, I’ve been scouring the web for “no-code” founder interviews. The goal was to find insights on which acquisition channels worked for them on getting new users. Here are the top 9 acquisition channels I’ve found to be working for no-code SaaS companies:&nbsp;</span></p><h2><strong>1. Product Hunt</strong></h2><p><span><strong><a href="https://producthunt.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ProductHunt.com</a></strong> is the biggest website in the world for launching your product. NoCode is a directory of no-code tools and they’ve used ProductHunt to <strong><a href="https://www.indiehackers.com/interview/building-a-directory-of-tools-and-resources-for-non-technical-makers-0db30533a5" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">launch successfully</a></strong>.</span></p><blockquote><p><span>A few weeks after publicly launching the site, I was fortunate enough to get featured on Product Hunt. This provided a huge boost of traffic to the site, providing me with a couple of hundred email subscribers and loads of constructive feedback to consider.</span></p></blockquote><h2><strong>2. Integration marketing</strong></h2><p><span>Is there an event/website/class you can integrate with? Bubble (making $100k+/month) (the biggest no-code tool online) did just that in order to get new users:</span></p><blockquote><p><span>The following year (2013) we did a pilot at Harvard Business School, which I had just graduated from”. Their first-year entrepreneurship class required students to build something under a very tight budget, and Bubble was a good solution for this. It got us a few more users, some of whom now use Bubble to professionally build apps for corporations!</span></p></blockquote><p><span>Source: <a href="https://www.indiehackers.com/interview/creating-a-100-000-mo-business-that-helps-people-learn-to-code-c5e87bdbf9" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Interview</a> – <a id="ember58" href="https://www.indiehackers.com/estraschnov?id=wo2QqEVUM9c2p0eB81oZSPQb9R13"><span>Emmanuel Straschnov</span></a>&nbsp;</span></p><h2><strong>&nbsp;3. LinkedIn Outreach</strong></h2><p><span>You can use LinkedIn to reach people in a certain position within a company. This is what MySocialApp ($8K/month) did to get new users. They’re a tool to help companies build social apps without code:</span></p><blockquote><p><span>How did we find prospects? Our premium LinkedIn account was the most effective. LinkedIn’s filters allow you to search for people of any position, so it’s a really good tool for finding and involving the right contacts. Marketing automation is our new main focus, and we invest in it to maximize sales conversions.</span></p></blockquote><p>Source: <a href="https://www.indiehackers.com/interview/social-media-platform-as-a-service-growing-to-8k-mo-2e608c3258" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Interview</a> – <a id="ember58" href="https://www.indiehackers.com/ev0xmusic?id=tA7oV5tgGrdxcKRFt3sUVCfw1uD3"><span>Romaric Philogène</span></a></p><h2><strong>&nbsp;4. “Powered by” marketing&nbsp;</strong></h2><p><span>MySocialApp ($8K/mo) is a no-code tool to create a social media app. Before creating it, the founder worked on Nousmotards, which was a social media app for motorcyclists.</span></p><blockquote><p><span>Over the three years we spent working on Nousmotards, many people contacted us to find out if we were using a pre-made solution for its technical infrastructure, which got us thinking about MySocialApp.</span></p></blockquote><p><span>Source: <a href="https://www.indiehackers.com/interview/social-media-platform-as-a-service-growing-to-8k-mo-2e608c3258" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Interview</a> – <a id="ember58" href="https://www.indiehackers.com/ev0xmusic?id=tA7oV5tgGrdxcKRFt3sUVCfw1uD3"><span>Romaric Philogène</span></a></span></p><p><span>This got them the initial idea about MySocialApp; users asking them what Nousmotards is “powered by”. This also happened with many other no-code startups we analyzed. Someone will see your no-code widget on their website, see a “powered by X” link and sign up. Live chat companies are the most famous example.</span></p><h2><strong>&nbsp;5. Meetups as acquisition channels</strong></h2><p><span>Online/offline <strong><a href="https://www.solveo.co/work/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">hackathons</a></strong>, meetups, local conferences. There are plenty of happening each and every day and participating/sponsoring them can be a great way to get new users. This is what Bubble did:&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><blockquote><p><span>We started “recruiting” users at tech meetups in New York. With the startup wave, everybody was looking for a tech co-founder, and there were plenty of co-founder-dating meetups. We went there and told people that while we couldn’t be their tech co-founders, they could use Bubble, as it would allow them to build the whole thing themselves. We had a few skeptical responses, but a few teams decided to try it, and they stuck with us for more than a year! </span></p></blockquote><p><span>Source: <a href="https://www.indiehackers.com/interview/creating-a-100-000-mo-business-that-helps-people-learn-to-code-c5e87bdbf9" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Interview</a> – <a id="ember58" href="https://www.indiehackers.com/estraschnov?id=wo2QqEVUM9c2p0eB81oZSPQb9R13"><span>Emmanuel Straschnov</span></a></span></p><h2><strong>6. Guest posting&nbsp;</strong></h2><p><span>Guest posting worked for NoCode ($400/mo) – a directory of no-code tools (so non-technical founders can create what only technical founders could in the past):</span></p><blockquote><p><span>I have also done some guest blogging on other prominent sites that work really well, increasing the number of high-quality backlinks to the site and in turn slowly improving my SEO ranking. It’s not something you see instant results with. However, it’s certainly worth the effort. </span></p></blockquote><p><span>Source: <a href="https://www.indiehackers.com/interview/building-a-directory-of-tools-and-resources-for-non-technical-makers-0db30533a5" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Interview</a> – <a id="ember58" href="https://www.indiehackers.com/thisdickie?id=q4tUifsiQNZWCoNqGb1kVg3BYvj2"><span>Sam Dickie</span></a></span></p><h2><strong>7. Your own marketplace</strong></h2><p><span>If you get big enough, you’ll want to make use out of the users you have. Creating a marketplace is one way to do it. This is what Bubble ($100k/month) did:</span></p><p><em><span>What’s your business model, and how have you grown your revenue?</span></em></p><blockquote><p><span>We also have a marketplace where users can build templates or plugins and get compensated for them. There were a few different models before the current one, but they weren’t as clear to our users. We started charging by user visits and then by workflow runs, but we’ve learned from users that server capacity is the best resource to sell. </span></p></blockquote><p><span>Source: <a href="https://www.indiehackers.com/interview/creating-a-100-000-mo-business-that-helps-people-learn-to-code-c5e87bdbf9" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Interview</a> – <a id="ember58" href="https://www.indiehackers.com/estraschnov?id=wo2QqEVUM9c2p0eB81oZSPQb9R13"><span>Emmanuel Straschnov</span></a></span></p><h2><strong>&nbsp;8. BetaList</strong></h2><p><span><a href="https://betalist.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">BetaList.com</a> is a popular website where people can get early, beta access (thus the name “Beta”) to various (mostly digital) products.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>&nbsp;NoCode ($400/mo), a directory of no-code tools, used BetaList successfully:</span></p><blockquote><p><span>Initially, as I was creating NoCode I built a quick landing page with an email capture form and a mocked-up screenshot of the homepage using Canva.</span></p><p><span>I then managed to get featured on BetaList where I got about 35 signups.

SEO (after being successful with other acquisition channels)</strong></h2><p><span>SEO often reveals itself as an acquisition strategy as you focus on other acquisition channels. You notice a certain % of people come from Google / convert as paying customers, you see what keywords they come from and then start to proactively focus on <a href="https://jelvix.com/blog/saas-business-metrics" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ranking higher</a> for those &amp; related terms. This is what happened to NoCode:</span></p><blockquote><p><span>To improve my SEO I hired a freelance SEO expert via Fiverr to optimize the site as I didn’t have a clue how to structure my site map or meta tags. After a few months, I noticed a substantial improvement in traffic coming via Google.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>A lot of my traffic now comes from my mockup generator directory which ranks number 2 on Google when you search for the term ‘online mockup generator’.</span></p></blockquote><p><span>Source: <a href="https://www.indiehackers.com/interview/building-a-directory-of-tools-and-resources-for-non-technical-makers-0db30533a5" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Interview</a> – <a id="ember58" href="https://www.indiehackers.com/thisdickie?id=q4tUifsiQNZWCoNqGb1kVg3BYvj2"><span>Sam Dickie</span></a></span></p><h2><strong>Want more acquisition channels?</strong></h2><p><span>I’ve spent 2 years researching acquisition channels that work consistently/repeatedly for founders.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><figure><img src="https://serhack.me/images/bitcoin-getting-started/social_oasis.jpg"><figcaption><h4>A man looks for Bitcoin Oasis</h4></figcaption></figure><p>If you have heard about blockchain or cryptocurrency, then the term that initially comes to mind is <a href="https://bitcoin.org/">Bitcoin</a>. Launched 12 years ago, it was the late 2017 bull run that created a media frenzy that propelled Bitcoin into the mainstream and our modern day lexicon.</p><p>Often labeled as the “original” cryptocurrency, <a href="https://bitcoin.org/">Bitcoin</a> has been the catalyst (directly and/or indirectly) behind many new innovations in the blockchain and digital asset space, most notably <a href="https://ethereum.org/">Ethereum</a> and <a href="https://getmonero.org/">Monero</a>. Shortly after the late 2017 bull run lost its steam, interest in these new technologies started to fade ― but here we are in 2021 with Bitcoin having risen like a phoenix from the ashes. As you would assume, an appetite for the blockchain and digital asset space has returned and now it is more important than ever that we understand what exactly is behind this unique asset, Bitcoin.</p><p>This article is meant to be a guide for individuals who are new to cryptocurrency and want to learn about <a href="https://bitcoin.org/">Bitcoin</a>, specifically its use case and the different ways to become involved in the broader blockchain and digital asset space. My goal is to educate you on the basics and make sure that you walk away with a newfound perspective and understanding of <a href="https://bitcoin.org/">Bitcoin</a>.</p><h2 id="what-is-bitcoin">What is Bitcoin?</h2><p>Bitcoin is a peer-to-peer version of electronic cash whose transactions are recorded in a public distributed ledger called a blockchain. In late October 2008, Satoshi Nakamoto (whose identity is still unknown) published a white paper titled <a href="https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf"><em>Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System</em></a> on bitcoin.org (registered in August 2008) and subsequently posted it to <a href="https://www.metzdowd.com/pipermail/cryptography/2008-October/014810.html">a cryptography mailing list</a>. On January 3, 2009, the Bitcoin network was created when Satoshi Nakamoto mined the initial block of the chain, which is called the genesis block.</p><p>In essence, Bitcoin is a decentralized type of “digital money” that can be used by anyone around the world, at any time, and without restrictions or a central authority. Bitcoin is not backed by any bank or government and originally allowed users to freely send and/or spend it anywhere without trusting third parties.</p><p>At inception, the price of Bitcoin was approximately $0.01 and, as of today, the price has surpassed $40,000 per coin ― with many believing that it can grow exponentially higher to levels between $100,000 and $250,000 in the next year or so.</p><figure><img src="https://serhack.me/images/bitcoin-getting-started/extras_1_blockchain-80.jpg"><figcaption><h4>The transactions data are memorized through a chain-of-blocks</h4></figcaption></figure><p>Given that Bitcoin exists and operates within the confounds of the Internet, all user balances are kept on an immutable and fully transparent blockchain. Put simply, each Bitcoin transaction is broadcasted to the Bitcoin network and grouped with several other transactions in the form of a block, which the network’s miners validate. Once the block is accepted, the transactions get recorded on the blockchain (which, as you may recall, is a public ledger). Whenever this process is successfully completed, the network distributes new Bitcoin to miners for each block that has been validated ― this is referred to as a block reward.</p><p>The peculiarity of the blockchain is its distribution and decentralized properties, as all the nodes share a valid copy of the public ledger. In the Bitcoin network, nodes play a very important role ― think of them as “protectors” who are constantly monitoring Bitcoin’s blockchain to distinguish legitimate Bitcoin transactions from illegitimate ones. The basic job of a node is to prevent attempts to double-spend Bitcoins that have already been spent elsewhere. In addition, the process of mining is essential to validating transactions, as it ensures the overall trustworthiness and security of the payment network.</p><h2 id="advantages-and-limitations">Advantages and Limitations</h2><p>Members of the cryptocurrency community, who range from the tech savvy to your average retail investor, have adopted various perspectives regarding the fundamental driver of Bitcoin’s value (both in financial and non-financial terms).</p><p>On one side, there are the Bitcoin Maximalists who believe that Bitcoin is the ultimate financial innovation and will assume a mainstream role in global society ― to maximalists, other cryptocurrencies and traditional financial instruments are inferior. On the other side, you have cryptocurrency enthusiasts who believe Bitcoin’s technology is outdated and that other cryptocurrencies, such as Ethereum, have more expansive utility.</p><p>These arguments and differences of opinion (as it relates to Bitcoin) can often become confusing, so let’s dig deeper into some of the most common discussion points with hopes that you can decipher for yourself.</p><h3 id="advantages">Advantages</h3><ul><li>A blockchain is managed autonomously using <strong>a peer-to-peer network</strong> and cannot be shut down ― the only way to stop it is through shutting down or banning Internet access. (Note: Even though a blockchain or Bitcoin cannot be shut down, some jurisdictions have imposed restrictions on citizens that limit or ban the holding or trading of Bitcoin and/or other cryptocurrencies.)</li><li>There is no need to trust a third party. <strong>You are your own bank!</strong></li><li>Relatively quick and cheap transactions without intermediary fees (around 10 minutes on average per transaction), when compared to most leading cryptocurrencies.</li><li>Increasing adoption by merchants and individuals across the globe.</li><li>Largest market capitalization and name recognition, which will continue to promote its growth and (hopefully) price stability.</li></ul><h3 id="limitations">Limitations</h3><ul><li><strong>Lack of anonymity</strong> as transactions that take place in the Bitcoin network, along with many other leading cryptocurrencies, are fully transparent and can potentially be linked via chain analysis. In addition, strict AML/KYC regulations require many of the leading cryptocurrency trading exchanges to verify your most sensitive personal information.</li><li>Slow and expensive transactions, when compared to lesser known cryptocurrencies that can be sent within seconds and at a fraction of the cost.</li><li>Irreversible transactions. Once a transaction is sent, you cannot undo or cancel the transaction.</li><li>Achievement of its status as a currency will be challenging due to its volatile nature (i.e. swings in price) and regulations.</li><li>The core technology has some subtle limits that make Bitcoin outdated in comparison with other cryptocurrencies.</li></ul><p>Along with Bitcoin Maximalists and cryptocurrency enthusiasts, you have many individuals who simply like to be long-term holders of Bitcoin (because they believe in the fundamentals and value proposition) and others who speculate on the short-term price (e.g. day traders).</p><p>Whatever side you are on, there is no question that Bitcoin has established itself as a serious contender in the financial world and is here to stay for the time being. There may be other alternatives, but the granddaddy of cryptocurrencies still has the spotlight!</p><h2 id="how-to-obtain-bitcoin-from-an-exchange">How to Obtain Bitcoin from an Exchange</h2><p>Now that you have an understanding of Bitcoin and its utility, you may be interested in purchasing some. If that is the case, you have come to the right place as buying it is now easier than ever due to the growing number of exchanges and companies making Bitcoin accessible to the masses.</p><p>Some of the most well-known exchanges that allow you to purchase Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are <a href="https://coinbase.com/">Coinbase</a>, <a href="https://www.gemini.com/">Gemini</a>, <a href="https://www.kraken.com/">Kraken</a>, <a href="https://binance.com/">Binance</a>, and <a href="https://www.huobi.com/en-us/">Huobi</a>. While all of these exchanges list Bitcoin, not all of them offer the same cryptocurrencies ― so, it is recommended to open accounts across a few exchanges to ensure that you are provided adequate exposure.</p><p>Once you have created an account on an exchange, you can transfer your local fiat money via ACH or bank wire to the exchange. From there, you can purchase Bitcoin or another cryptocurrency in exchange for your local fiat money. In addition, after purchasing Bitcoin, you can exchange it for another cryptocurrency that you might not be able to purchase with your local fiat money. While some exchanges offer credit card purchases of Bitcoin, please keep in mind that the fees associated with this transaction are typically very high.</p><figure><img src="https://serhack.me/images/bitcoin-getting-started/extras_2_exchange-80.jpg"><figcaption><h4>You can exchange central currencies (EUR, USD) to BTC, but sacrificing privacy.</h4></figcaption></figure><p>Using any of the exchanges listed above is the easiest and most convenient way to purchase Bitcoin, as the majority of the other cryptocurrency exchanges do not support fiat currencies. This being the case, you can only exchange other cryptocurrencies (like Ethereum or Monero) for Bitcoin. <a href="https://cash.app/">Cash App</a> and <a href="https://www.paypal.com/us/webapps/mpp/crypto">PayPal</a>, some of the largest financial technology companies, offer its users the ability to purchase Bitcoin. While this is extremely convenient for users of these platforms, the downside for PayPal (not Cash App) is that your Bitcoin must remain on its platform, so you cannot transfer or send it. Remember: Not your keys, not your coins.</p><p>If you are not keen on using any of the methods described above, Bitcoin ATMs are a great alternative. There are over 14,000 physical ATMs worldwide, most of which can be found in major cities at peculiar locations such as a shopping mall, burger restaurant, or a bar. All you need to do is deposit cash and enter your Bitcoin address. Once you have completed the transaction, the funds will be sent to you. This is a very simple process and typically does not require any identity verification, but beware of high fees!</p><h2 id="who-accepts-bitcoin">Who Accepts Bitcoin?</h2><p>Over the years, many individuals and businesses have begun accepting Bitcoin as a form of payment. From time to time, you might have noticed stickers on a shop’s window that says “Bitcoin accepted here.” As mentioned above, after the bull run of late 2017 died down, overall interest in cryptocurrencies (especially Bitcoin) amongst merchants began to wane. Today, Bitcoin and the broader digital asset space has bounced back from a pricing perspective and, with this, so has the interest amongst merchants who have triggered another wave of increased acceptance, most notably <a href="https://apnews.com/article/financial-markets-elon-musk-bitcoin-061817c6795e75d1c3c9e9d6cfc4a911">Tesla</a> disclosing that it has invested approximately $1.5 billion into Bitcoin and that the company plans to accept Bitcoin as payment for its electric vehicles.</p><p>There have been a few prominent …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p id="h.l7qn47u1544x"><span>Building web apps without a SPA - A case study</span></p><p><span>We all know that feeling. You’re scrolling through a page that’s full of mostly static content - constantly being interrupted by spinners - and the thought hits you, “Why did they use Javascript for this?”</span></p><p><span>Now this might not always be fair. I’ve done a fair amount of web development and there is definitely a time and a place for a SPA. And rendering libraries like React make client side work an absolute pleasure. But that’s not what I’m going to write about today. I’m going to write about all the </span><span>other</span><span>&nbsp;cases. Or as I like to call it, 73.6% of the internet.</span></p><p><span>My fiance is studying to become a veterinary physiotherapist. She has to learn </span><span>a lot</span><span>&nbsp;of animal body parts. She’s picked up a few books along the way to help her memorise various animal parts that normally look something like this:</span></p><p><span><img alt="" src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/kALs0Nu-AjBdB7ujRxyewUokHCMcT-idZaQ0aqQrhVJUP8x3c1g4Hf3E_3A_DZWW-TOdcig3Y_gl3Z8zzE0uqPyEh0I2fI6Gw1nX_VGNnOMX1ekeUI8nrdKaxeet8SYKkLqsLbeg" title=""></span></p><p><span>Ladies and Gentlemen, the canine</span></p><p><span>I took a look at the content she was studying and thought it would probably be handy if we could put all those pictures into a little quiz app so that she could test herself. After a bit of requirements gathering, it was decided it needed to support:</span></p><ul><li><span>Profiles</span></li><li><span>A group management system to share profiles with others</span></li><li><span>Referencing and tags</span></li><li><span>Some way for her to upload pictures and map body parts</span></li><li><span>Quizzes (of course!)</span></li></ul><p><span>To keep it simple, we added two types of quizzes. The first kind points to a body part and asks you to choose what limb it is. The second kind of quiz names a part and asks you to select it on the picture. All you need to do is first prepare quizzes by uploading images and selecting the limbs.</span></p><p><span>This is what is ends up looking like:</span></p><p><span><img alt="" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/lLiY8kQz2JfDyeySZgzE6cC24HcQ_0MAw5a8ePJA1y94d5j-gDvv2e5aKOuYW7g0sKqW2qTfxKydlL1n_qCydremS_9GUpD-B9ymUfsXhwqxnjCbDkJD1TOiof5vU2vnxiZuKC_d" title=""></span></p><p><span>And here is what a quiz looks like:</span></p><p><span><img alt="" src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/nlY63N83LNXIJmA9fp530SXydjZIO16NLY1HUP9MVw-nQHQIYbU0RoglAf-QOSYgd3Yzwxz1WjnTCuFNxeAaFbgJxHFafhFQYQwB029O_ht-BbyN8kFKyEn-aYPOlIglV4lTKroJ" title=""></span></p><p><span>Nothing about this is particularly complex. I probably took around a day or so in total to add everything we wanted. I worked fast and loose and skipped automated tests because I don’t plan to work on it further (and most of it is CRUD operations).</span></p><p><span>What I would like to emphasize at this point is that I’ve seen many projects with a similar scope become a React/Angular/Bitcoin app. There are a few reasons I can think of (off the top of my head) for this:</span></p><ol start="1"><li><span>The developer would like to learn a new stack (nothing wrong with this!)</span></li><li><span>The developer uses it out of muscle memory</span></li><li><span>The developer wants to create an app like experience and things this will result in faster performance</span></li></ol><p><span>I have no issue with the first reason. I also don’t have an issue with the second reason when you just want to get something done fast and you’re comfortable with a way of working. What I would like to question however is the third reason.</span></p><p><span>When working on a smaller project, I often find that it is both simpler to reason with, and faster to write everything in the backend. And I don’t just mean faster in terms of development. I think you can make a much faster system overall when you’re not sending a bulky javascript bundle that needs to perform client side rendering.</span></p><p><span>As it turns out, a lot of people think server side rendering is slow simply because of the downloading and parsing browsers need to do with javascript. But there’s a handy little library I absolutely love that alleviates this problem entirely. </span><span><a href="https://github.com/turbolinks/turbolinks">Turbolinks</a></span><span>&nbsp;(made by the good folks at </span><span><a href="https://basecamp.com/">basecamp</a></span><span>) intercepts the links on your page and replaces them with ajax requests. It then takes care of placing the content back in your page. What this means is that you can entirely work </span><span>as if</span><span>&nbsp;your app is entirely server side, while still leaving it feeling very much like a web app. And the best part is we get to leave the browser to do the rendering work instead of a javascript engine! Browsers are actually pretty good at doing that.</span></p><p><span>Here’s what it ends up looking like in action:</span></p><p><span><img alt="" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-blx8YYUJdB1_aOeLIz7VAlPxsVolWFfNOA9uMvo1r41gUFUG-lv-u3wrqx6tRq5BOCRy5oJF4kDsNBh5UjH8hCsC6Bowlcl3umzLrAWlJHJUTyPQRB16VA-EdLMp0Xao_vAVFa4" title=""></span></p><p><span>Disclaimer:</span><span>&nbsp;I haven’t given it a go yet because it’s still in beta but the basecamp team has moved onto </span><span><a href="https://github.com/hotwired/turbo">Turbo</a></span><span>&nbsp;which is supposed to replace Turbolinks.</span></p><p><span>Then just to be extra safe, for the small parts of javascript I do use (for the quiz questions) I use </span><span><a href="https://rollupjs.org/guide/en/">rollup</a></span><span>&nbsp;to bundle it together. This ends up producing a very nice and small javascript bundle because I refused to use any javascript dependencies for the client side code. The bundle clocks in around 3.9kB.</span></p><p><span>What this results in is a very light weight, and easy to develop web app. Obviously there’s not a silver bullet that solves all problems but the next time you’re building a web app, it might be worth taking a step back and asking the question, “Do I really need a javascript frontend framework for this?”</span></p><p><span>As always you can find the code here if you want to take a deeper look:</span></p><p><span><a href="https://gitlab.com/BenWiser/physio-quiz">https://gitlab.com/BenWiser/physio-quiz</a></span></p></div></div>]]>

<p>In this post we’ll discuss how Spotify optimized and sped up elements from our largest Dataflow job, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://engineering.atspotify.com/2020/02/18/spotify-unwrapped-how-we-brought-you-a-decade-of-data/" target="_blank">Wrapped 2019</a>, for <a href="https://open.spotify.com/genre/2020-page">Wrapped 2020</a> using a technique called Sort Merge Bucket (SMB) join. We’ll present the design and implementation of SMB and how we incorporated it into our data pipelines.</p>



<h2>Introduction</h2>



<p>Shuffle is the core building block for many big data transforms, such as a join, GroupByKey, or other reduce operations. Unfortunately, it’s also one of the most expensive steps in many pipelines. Sort Merge Bucket is an optimization that reduces shuffle by doing work up front on the producer side. The intuition is that for datasets commonly and frequently joined on a known key, e.g., user events with user metadata on a user ID, we can write them in bucket files with records bucketed and sorted by that key. By knowing which files contain a subset of keys and in what order, shuffle becomes a matter of merge-sorting values from matching bucket files, completely eliminating costly disk and network I/O of moving key–value pairs around. Andrea Nardelli carried out the original investigation on Sort Merge Buckets for his <a href="http://kth.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:1334587/FULLTEXT01.pdf">2018 master’s thesis</a>, and we started looking into generalizing the idea as a <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://spotify.github.io/scio/extras/Sort-Merge-Bucket.html" target="_blank">Scio module</a> afterwards.</p>



<h2>Design and Implementation</h2>



<p>The majority of the data pipelines at Spotify are written in <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://github.com/spotify/scio" target="_blank">Scio</a>, a Scala API for <a href="https://beam.apache.org/">Apache Beam</a>, and run on the <a href="https://cloud.google.com/dataflow">Google Cloud Dataflow</a> service. We implemented SMB in Java to be closer to the native Beam SDK (and even wrote and collaborated on a <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1AQlonN8t4YJrARcWzepyP7mWHTxHAd6WIECwk1s3LQQ/edit?usp=sharing">design document with the Beam community</a>), and provide Scala syntactic sugar in Scio like many other I/Os. The design is modularized into the main components listed below — we’ll start with the two top-level SMB <a href="https://beam.apache.org/documentation/programming-guide/#transforms" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PTransforms</a> — the write and read operations SortedBucketSink and SortedBucketSource.</p>



<h3>SortedBucketSink</h3>



<p>This transform writes a <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://beam.apache.org/documentation/programming-guide/#pcollections" target="_blank">PCollection</a>&lt;T&gt; (where T has a corresponding <a href="https://github.com/spotify/scio/blob/master/scio-smb/src/main/java/org/apache/beam/sdk/extensions/smb/FileOperations.java" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">FileOperations&lt;T&gt;</a> instance) in SMB format. It first extracts keys and assigns bucket IDs using logic provided by <a href="https://github.com/spotify/scio/blob/master/scio-smb/src/main/java/org/apache/beam/sdk/extensions/smb/BucketMetadata.java" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">BucketMetadata</a>, groups key–values by the ID, sorts all values, and then writes them into files corresponding to bucket IDs using the FileOperations instance.</p>



<p>In addition to the bucket files, a JSON file is also written to the output directory representing the information from BucketMetadata that’s necessary to read the source: the number of buckets, the hashing scheme, and the instructions to extract the key from each record (for example, for Avro records we can encode this instruction with the name of the GenericRecord field containing the key).</p>

<h3>SortedBucketSource</h3>



<p>This transform reads from one or more sources written in SMB format with the same key and hashing scheme. It opens file handles for corresponding buckets from each source (using FileOperations&lt;T&gt; for that input type) and merges them while maintaining sorted order. Results are emitted as <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://github.com/apache/beam/blob/master/sdks/java/core/src/main/java/org/apache/beam/sdk/transforms/join/CoGbkResult.java" target="_blank">CoGbkResult</a> objects per key group, the same class Beam uses for regular Cogroup operations, so the user can extract the results per source with the correct parameterized type.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="700" height="365" src="https://storage.googleapis.com/rnd-atspotify/sites/2/2021/02/image7-700x365.png" alt="" srcset="https://storage.googleapis.com/rnd-atspotify/sites/2/2021/02/image7-700x365.png 700w, https://storage.googleapis.com/rnd-atspotify/sites/2/2021/02/image7-250x130.png 250w, https://storage.googleapis.com/rnd-atspotify/sites/2/2021/02/image7-768x400.png 768w, https://storage.googleapis.com/rnd-atspotify/sites/2/2021/02/image7-120x63.png 120w, https://storage.googleapis.com/rnd-atspotify/sites/2/2021/02/image7.png 1067w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px"></figure>



<h3>FileOperations</h3>



<p>FileOperations abstracts away the reading and writing of individual bucket files. Since we need fine-grained control over the exact elements and their order in every file, we cannot leverage the existing Beam file I/Os, which operate on a PCollection level and abstract away the locality and order of elements. Instead, SMB file operations happen at a lower level of BoundedSource for input and ParDo for output. Currently Avro, BigQuery TableRow JSON, and TensorFlow TFRecord/Example records are supported. We plan to add other formats like Parquet as well.</p>



<h3>BucketMetadata</h3>



<p>This class abstracts the keying and bucketing of elements, and includes information such as key field, class, number of buckets, shards, and hash function. The metadata is serialized as a JSON file alongside data files when writing, and used to check compatibility when reading SMB sources.</p>



<h3>Optimizations and Variants</h3>



<p>Over the last year and a half we’ve been adopting SMB at Spotify for various use cases, and accumulated many improvements to handle the scale and complexity of our data pipelines.</p>



<ul><li><strong>Date partitioning:</strong> At Spotify, event data is written to Google Cloud Services (GCS) in hourly or daily partitions. A common data engineering use case is to read many partitions in a single pipeline — for example, to compute stream count over the last seven days. For a non-SMB read, this can be easily done in a single PTransform using wildcard file patterns to match files across multiple directories. However, unlike most File I/Os in Beam, the SMB Read API requires the input to be specified as a directory, rather than a file pattern (this is because we need to check the directory’s metadata.json file as well as the actual record files). Additionally, it must match up bucket files across partitions as well as across different sources, while ensuring that the CoGbkResult output correctly groups data from all partitions of a source into the same TupleTag key. We evolved the SMB Read API to accept one or more directories <em>per source</em>.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<ul><li><strong>Sharding:</strong> Although the Murmur class of hash functions we use during bucket assignment usually ensures an even distribution of records across buckets, in some instances one or more buckets may be disproportionately large if the key space is skewed, creating possible OOM errors when grouping and sorting records. In this case, we allow users to specify a number of <em>shards</em> to further split each bucket file. During the bucket assignment step, a value between [0, numShards) is generated randomly <a href="https://beam.apache.org/documentation/runtime/model/#bundling-and-persistence"><em>per bundle</em></a>. Since this value is computed completely orthogonally to the bucket ID, it can break up large key groups across files. Since each shard is still written in sorted order, they can simply be merged together at read time.</li></ul>



<ul><li><strong>Parallelism:</strong> Since the number of buckets in an SMB sink is always a power of 2, we can come up with a joining scheme across sources with different numbers of buckets based off of a desired level of parallelism specified by the user. For example, if the user wants to join Source 1 with 4 buckets and Source 2 with 2 buckets, they can specify either:<ul><li><strong>Minimum parallelism,</strong> or “Merge Greatest Buckets” strategy: 2 parallel readers will be created. Each reader will read 2 buckets from source A and 1 from source B, merging them together. Because bucket IDs are assigned by taking the integer hash value of the key modulo the desired number of buckets, mathematically we know that the key spaces of the merged buckets overlap.</li><li><strong>Maximum parallelism,</strong> or “Least Bucket Replication” strategy: 4 parallel readers will be created. Each reader will read 1 bucket from Source A and 1 from Source B. After merging each key group, the reader will have to rehash the key modulo the greatest number of buckets, to avoid emitting duplicate values. Therefore, even though this strategy achieves a higher level of parallelism, there is some overhead of computing duplicate values and rehashing to eliminate them.</li><li><strong>Auto parallelism:</strong> Creates a number of readers between minimal and maximal amounts, based on a desired split size value provided by the Runner at runtime.</li></ul></li></ul>

<ul><li><strong>SortedBucketTransform:</strong> A common usage pattern is for pipelines to enrich an existing dataset by joining it with one or more other sources, then writing it to an output location. We decided to specifically support this in SMB with a unique PTransform that reads, transforms, and writes output using the same keying and bucketing scheme. By doing the read/transform/write logic per bucket on the same worker, we can avoid having to reshuffle the data and recompute buckets — since the key is the same, we know that the transformed elements from bucket M of the inputs also correspond to bucket M in the output, in the same sorted order as they were read from.</li></ul>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="700" height="320" src="https://storage.googleapis.com/rnd-atspotify/sites/2/2021/02/image4-700x320.png" alt="" srcset="https://storage.googleapis.com/rnd-atspotify/sites/2/2021/02/image4-700x320.png 700w, https://storage.googleapis.com/rnd-atspotify/sites/2/2021/02/image4-250x114.png 250w, https://storage.googleapis.com/rnd-atspotify/sites/2/2021/02/image4-768x351.png 768w, https://storage.googleapis.com/rnd-atspotify/sites/2/2021/02/image4-120x55.png 120w, https://storage.googleapis.com/rnd-atspotify/sites/2/2021/02/image4.png 902w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px"></figure>



<ul><li><strong>External Sort:</strong> We made a number of improvements to Beam’s <a href="https://github.com/apache/beam/tree/master/sdks/java/extensions/sorter">external sorter extension</a>, including replacing the Hadoop sequence file with the native file I/O, removing the 2GB memory limit, and reducing disk usage and coder overhead.</li></ul>



<h2>Adoption — Core Data Producers</h2>



<p>Since SMB requires data to be bucketed and sorted in a specific fashion, the adoption naturally starts from the producer of that data. A majority of the Spotify data processing relies on a few core data sets that act as single sources of truth for various business domains like streaming activities, user metadata and streaming context. We worked with the maintainer of these data sets to convert a year’s worth of data to SMB format.</p>



<p>Implementation was straightforward since SortedBucketSink is mostly a drop-in replacement for the vanilla Avro sink with some extra settings. We were using Avro sink with the sharding option to control the number and size of output files. After migrating to SMB, we did not notice any major bump in terms of vCPU, vRAM, or wall time since sharding requires a full shuffle similar to the additional cost of SMB sinks. A few other settings we have since had to tweak:</p>



<ul><li>Agree on user_id as a hexadecimal string as bucket and sort key, since we need the same key type and semantic across all SMB datasets.</li><li>Set compression to DEFLATE with level 6 to be consistent with the default Avro sink in Scio. As a nice side effect of data being bucketed and sorted by key, we observed ~50% reduction in storage from better compression due to collocation of similar records.</li><li>Make sure output files are backwards compatible. SMB output files have “bucket-X-shard-Y” in their names but otherwise contain the same records with the same schema. So existing pipelines can consume them without any code change; they just do not leverage the speedup in certain join cases.</li></ul>



<h2>Adoption — Wrapped 2020</h2>

  <p><span>09 Feb 2021</span></p><p>Anyone who ever tried to cross-compile a C/C++ program knows how big a PITA the whole process could be. The main reasons for this sorry state of things are generally how byzantine build systems tend to be when configuring for cross-compilation, and how messy it is to set-up your cross toolchain in the first place.</p>

<p>One of the main culprits in my experience has been the GNU toolchain, the decades-old behemoth upon which the POSIXish world has been built for years.
Like many compilers of yore, GCC and its <code>binutils</code> brethren were never designed with the intent to support multiple targets within a single setup, with he only supported approach being installing a full cross build for each triple you wish to target on any given host.</p>

<p>For instance, assuming you wish to build something for FreeBSD on your Linux machine using GCC, you need:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A GCC + binutils install for your host triplet (i.e., <code>x86_64-pc-linux-gnu</code> or similar);</li>
  <li>A GCC + binutils complete install for your target triplet (i.e. <code>x86_64-unknown-freebsd12.2-gcc</code>, <code>as</code>, <code>nm</code>, etc)</li>
  <li>A sysroot containing the necessary libraries and headers, which you can either build yourself or promptly steal from a running installation of FreeBSD.</li>
</ul>

<p>This process is sometimes made simpler by Linux distributions or hardware vendors offering a selection of prepackaged compilers, but this will never suffice due to the sheer amount of possible host-target combinations. This sometimes means you have to build the whole toolchain yourself, something that, unless you rock a quite beefy CPU, tends to be a massive waste of time and power.</p>

<h2 id="clang-as-a-cross-compiler">Clang as a cross compiler</h2>

<p>This annoying limitation is one of the reasons why I got interested in LLVM (and thus Clang), which is by-design a full-fledged cross compiler toolchain and is mostly compatible with GNU. A single install can output and compile code <em>for every supported target</em>, as long as a complete sysroot is available at build time.</p>

<p>I found this to be a game-changer, and, while it can’t still compete in convenience with modern language toolchains (such as Go’s gc and <code>GOARCH</code>/<code>GOOS</code>), it’s night and day better than the rigmarole of setting up GNU toolchains. You can now just fetch whatever your favorite package management system has available in its repositories (as long as it’s not extremely old), and avoid messing around with multiple installs of GCC.</p>

<p>Until a few years ago, the whole process wasn’t as smooth as it could be. Due to LLVM not having a full toolchain yet available, you were still supposed to provide a <code>binutils</code> build specific for your target. While this is generally much more tolerable than building the whole compiler (<code>binutils</code> is relatively fast to build), it was still somewhat of a nuisance, and I’m glad that <code>llvm-mc</code> (LLVM’s integrated assembler) and <code>lld</code> (universal linker) are finally stable and as flexible as the rest of LLVM.</p>

<p>With the toolchain now set, the next step becomes to obtain a sysroot in order to provide the needed headers and libraries to compile and link for your target.</p>

<h2 id="obtaining-a-sysroot">Obtaining a sysroot</h2>
<p>A super fast way to find a working system directory for a given OS is to rip it straight out of an existing system (a Docker container image will often also do).
For instance, this is how I used <code>tar</code> through <code>ssh</code> as a quick way to extract a working sysroot from a FreeBSD 13-CURRENT AArch64 VM <sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>$ mkdir ~/farm_tree
$ ssh FARM64 'tar cf - /lib /usr/include /usr/lib /usr/local/lib /usr/local/include' | bsdtar xvf - -C $HOME/farm_tree/
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="invoking-the-cross-compiler">Invoking the cross compiler</h2>

<p>With everything set, it’s now only a matter of invoking Clang with the right arguments:</p>

<p>In the snipped above, I have managed to compile and link a C++ file into an executable for AArch64 FreeBSD, all while using just the <code>clang</code> and <code>lld</code> I had already installed on my GNU/Linux system.</p>

<p>More in detail:</p>
<ol>
  <li><code>--target</code> switches the LLVM default target (<code>x86_64-pc-linux-gnu</code>) to <code>aarch64-pc-freebsd</code>, thus enabling cross-compilation.</li>
  <li><code>--sysroot</code> forces Clang to assume the specified path as root when searching headers and libraries, instead of the usual paths. Note that sometimes this setting might not be enough, especially if the target uses GCC and Clang somehow fails to detect its install path. This can be easily fixed by specifying <code>--gcc-toolchain</code>, which clarifies where to search for GCC installations.</li>
  <li><code>-fuse-ld=lld</code> tells Clang to use <code>lld</code> instead whatever default the platform uses. As I will explain below, it’s highly unlikely that the system linker understands foreign targets, while LLD can natively support <em>almost</em> every binary format and OS <sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup>.</li>
  <li><code>-stdlib=libc++</code> is needed here due to Clang failing to detect that FreeBSD on AArch64 uses LLVM’s <code>libc++</code> instead of GCC’s <code>libstdc++</code>.</li>
  <li><code>-lz</code> is also specified to show how Clang can also resolve other libraries inside the sysroot without issues, in this case, <code>zlib</code>.</li>
</ol>

<p>The final test is now to copy the binary to our target system (i.e. the VM we ripped the sysroot from before) and check if it works as expected:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span>rsync zpipe FARM64:<span>"~"</span>

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Success! It’s now possible to use this cross toolchain to build larger programs, and below I’ll give a quick example to how to use it to build real projects.</p>

<h3 id="optional-creating-an-llvm-toolchain-directory">Optional: creating an LLVM toolchain directory</h3>

<p>LLVM provides a mostly compatible counterpart for almost every tool shipped by <code>binutils</code> (with the notable exception of <code>as</code> <sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3">3</a></sup>), prefixed with <code>llvm-</code>.</p>

<p>The most critical of these is LLD, which is a drop in replacement for a plaform’s system linker, capable to replace both GNU <code>ld.bfd</code> and <code>gold</code> on GNU/Linux or BSD, and Microsoft’s <code>LINK.EXE</code> when targeting MSVC. It supports linking on (almost) every platform supported by LLVM, thus removing the nuisance to have multiple specific linkers installed.</p>

<p>Both GCC and Clang support using <code>ld.lld</code> instead of the system linker (which may well be <code>lld</code>, like on FreeBSD) via the command line switch <code>-fuse-ld=lld</code>.</p>

<p>In my experience, I found that Clang’s driver might get confused when picking the right linker on some uncommon platforms, especially before version 11.0.
For some reason, <code>clang</code> sometimes decided to outright ignore the <code>-fuse-ld=lld</code> switch and picked the system linker (<code>ld.bfd</code> in my case), which does not support AArch64.</p>

<p>A fast solution to this is to create a toolchain directory containing symlinks that rename the LLVM utilities to the standard <code>binutils</code> programs:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span> <span>ls</span> <span>-la</span> ~/.llvm/bin/
Permissions Size User  Group Date Modified Name
lrwxrwxrwx    16 marco marco  3 Aug  2020  ar -&gt; /usr/bin/llvm-ar
lrwxrwxrwx    12 marco marco  6 Aug  2020  ld -&gt; /usr/bin/lld
lrwxrwxrwx    21 marco marco  3 Aug  2020  objcopy -&gt; /usr/bin/llvm-objcopy

lrwxrwxrwx    21 marco marco  3 Aug  2020  strings -&gt; /usr/bin/llvm-strings
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The <code>-B</code> switch can then be used to force Clang (or GCC) to search the required tools in this directory, stopping the issue from ever occurring:</p>

<p>Before we get to my latest essay below—I’ve now opened enrollment for John David Ebert’s <a href="https://otherlife.co/jung">8-week masterclass</a> on the Swiss psychologist Carl Jung. The first live group discussion seminar will be Saturday, February 20th at 3pm Eastern. If you’re curious, <a href="https://gum.co/jung-guide">download the free study guide</a> and/or join us for <a href="https://lu.ma/jung-qa">a private Q&amp;A meeting</a> this Saturday, where you can sniff us out and get answers to any questions you might have. If you’re curious about John’s mastery of the material or his thinking style, I’d recommend his recent appearance on the Other Life podcast. OK—onto my post!</p>
<hr>
<p>I appreciate Michael Lind's <a href="https://www.thebellows.org/the-double-horseshoe-theory/">model</a> of the contemporary American class structure. He asks us to visualize two horseshoe structures:</p>
<blockquote><p>a lower horseshoe whose two prongs point up, and an upper horseshoe whose two prongs point down. The lower horseshoe has the underclass at the bottom/midpoint and the hub city working class and the heartland working class as the points of its two opposing prongs. The upper horseshoe has the managerial elite proper as its midpoint/apex and the professional bourgeoisie and the small business bourgeoisie as the points of its two opposing prongs.</p></blockquote>
<p>This model is pretty nifty, and it parsimoniously captures some ideological variation as well. Roughly, Lind suggests, the “center,” “left” and “right” map onto the managerial elite, the professional bourgeoisie, and the small business bourgeoisie. True elites just want stability, institutionalized bourgeois professionals want more government funding, and the self-employed want freedom from regulation and taxation. So far, so good.</p>
<p>But his sense of the near future is quite limited. It was only a parting remark, but</p>
<p>Lind suggests that any new cross-class alliance will have to create “powerful mass-membership, working-class organizations..."</p>
<p>I do not think this needs to happen, and I do not think it will happen. This is a powerful meme from pre-digital labor history, but I don’t think it bears much scrutiny. It’s the kind of thing Gen X socialists say when they don’t know what else to say.</p>
<p>I see a very different trajectory.</p>
<p>Consider Lind’s ”small business bourgeoisie,” which currently includes a lot of obsolete business models, like many local brick-and-mortar stores. There is a new player in this class, and it's the bootstrapped internet business—which doesn’t even require computer programming or much startup capital anymore. This includes a whole new breed of "DTC" or direct-to-consumer brands, but also the "creator economy" and even some of the crypto economy.</p>
<p>A non-trivial portion of Lind's "professional bourgeoisie" is defecting from legacy bureaucratic institutions (technologically indefensible prestige cartels), into this new tech-savvy faction of the small-business bourgeoisie. The clearest and most recent example is the massive wave of journalists quitting their jobs in favor of writing independently on Substack. But the 2 million people working full-time as internet “creators” already would have been enough to substantiate my claim.</p>
<p>Then within Lind's "managerial elite" (the major titans of industry and government), there is an increasingly salient cleavage between tech-centric libertarian types and paper-centric bureaucratic types. Think “west coast” figures like Marc Andreesen or Peter Thiel versus “east coast” figures like the Sulzbergers.</p>
<p>The "professional bourgeois" defecting from institutions into the small-business bourgeoisie are doing so because their institutional wage premia are being eroded by technology, so their shift is almost intrinsically tech-centric and libertarian.</p>
<p>We’re beginning to see an ideological realignment where the professional bourgeoisie increasingly defects from the old state-centric, pro-bureaucracy socialism into a new, more tech-centric communitarianism with socialistic longings but libertarian characteristics.</p>
<p>It’s not as contradictory as it sounds. For most left-wing intellectuals since Marx, their ideological alignment with state power was only ever a marriage of convenience. Their ultimate preference is always to abolish the state, but until that’s possible, they love the state as a necessary vehicle moving in the direction of liberation. In the digital age, left-leaning bourgeois intellectuals will retain their radical egalitarianism but their marriage of convenience will now be with technology and private wealth, which they will correctly see as the only viable bulwarks for egalitarian political structures moving forward.</p>
<p>If you doubt that ideologies and alliances can shift so quickly due to external changes in the economic landscape, read <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/1962581?seq=1">this classic political science paper.</a> Is “free trade” a left-wing or right-wing position? There’s no clear answer to this questions, because the content of “left” and “right” party programs fluctuates depending on opportunistic factors. If you look at left-wing parties across time and space, their position on the Free Trade issue is a function of how much land, labor, and capital there is in the country under consideration. </p>
<p>The newfound allies of our defecting professionals will be the tech-libertarian elites and, most confusingly, the working-class heartland—the true believers in the American freedom ethos. This is the only way to understand the new cleavage that puts on one side right-leaning media figures like Tucker Carlson, with defected left-leaning professional-bourgeois figures like Angela Nagle and Ariel Pink, with right-leaning tech figures such as Curtis Yarvin and Peter Thiel, with an army of anti-institutional solo-business creators as big as Joe Rogan and as small as the Patreon podcaster who is barely scraping by but nonetheless paying all of their bills with complete intellectual freedom.</p>
<p>A major catalyst of this realignment will be crypto. Crypto is fundamentally a redistribution of wealth and power away from the managerial elite (whose income is based on legacy cartels and fiat currency) toward anti-institutional outsiders (whose income is based on being correct before being accepted). This is another independent vector of change, which is also intrinsically tech-centric libertarian.</p>
<p>The American class structure is approaching a great schism that might very well make the Civil War of 1861 seem like a sibling rivalry.</p>
<p>On the one side, we will have a tech-centric libertarian camp connecting all of the most forward-thinking and freedom-focused people up and down the class hierarchy, boasting a fundamentally new and censorship-proof monetary system and wealth base.</p>
<p>On the other side, we will have everyone whose income is based on having paid dues to a legacy institution, plus the black urban underclass that the institutional bourgeois is essentially holding hostage (exploiting this faction's historical investment in the Democratic party, leaving them nowhere else to go, like abusive husbands do to their battered wives).</p>
<p>The big question is whether the captains of the sinking ship accelerate their bellicosity or ask for a lifeboat. In many ways, crypto provides the best thermometer for this growing cleavage: If the institutions gradually buy into crypto, then I would expect the USA to gradually morph into a tech-libertarian patchwork where all national and state bureaucracies gradually recede into nothingness and all power passes through blockchains.</p>
<p>If the US government tries to institute an outright ban on crypto—like Nigeria is doing right now—then all the crypto millionaires, the small-business intellectuals, and the freedom-loving rednecks would galvanize into a proto-secessionary unit. They would have most of the guns in America, and most of America’s greatest minds.</p>
<p>In the face of serious aggression from US institutions, this camp could either double-down on one of the untraceable cryptocurrencies and alternative networking models like Urbit, to sustain the true American nation in the shadow of the usurper government, or it would simply purchase a small country somewhere else. </p>
<p>Either way, we win.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>In the past month, two things happened to me that made me realize how glad I'm for using a password manager, namely <a href="https://1password.com/">1Password</a>.</p>
<p>First thing is about a login page. I was searching for a Github repo on DuckDuckGo, and I clicked on a link in the search results. As I was about to fill in the password with a 1Password shortcut, I noticed that 1Password wasn't filling in the login details. How strange, I thought. Puzzled, I looked at the url. And then I saw it—I almost fell for a phishing attack! The url was <a href="https://marcel.is/1password/github.com.cnpmjs.org">github.com.cnpmjs.org</a> instead of <a href="https://github.com/">github.com</a>. I knew of phishing attacks, and thought I'd never fell for such a simple trick. Yet, I almost did.</p>
<p>Second thing is about email. As I'm migrating away from gmail, I thought I would check out the spam folder. I usually don't do that, but I thought I'd peek in. One email caught my eye: the email subject was my password. The site must have been compromised and the attacker got hold of my email and password. Fortunately, the damage radius was minimal, as I have generated unique passwords for each site.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>After spending some weeks playing with Rust, I felt ready to test my skills and try some programming challenges in the <a href="https://adventofcode.com/">Advent Of Code</a>. My approach to tackle some of those challenges was to solve them using Javascript (I use it in my day to day) first and then port the code to Rust. While writing the port I just focus on getting the Rust code as elegant as possible to achieve that I research the Rust API's to get syntactically correct. It was after finishing porting this <a href="https://adventofcode.com/2018/day/5">puzzle</a> in particular and feeling a sense of accomplishment that I decided to test how the Rust compiled code will perform against Javascript interpreter.</p><h2 id="naive-algorithm">Naive Algorithm</h2><hr><p>Before jumping to the whom-was-slower-and-why, let’s take a quick look at <a href="https://adventofcode.com/2018/day/5">puzzle</a> (so you see there is no hidden agenda) which goes like this:</p><p>You are given an input string with <code>N</code> amount of characters and we should write an algorithm that find and remove any sequential pairs of characters that similar but have different capitalisation, examples of this are:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="sh">bB <span># Remove</span>
bb <span># Do Nothing</span>
ab <span># Do Nothing</span>
</code></pre></div><p>The algorithm should re-evaluate the string recursively searching for new pairs created after the removal, something like tetris.</p><p>We have this input:</p><p>We should remove <code>bB</code> to get:</p><p>Then because <code>aA</code> has been formed we should eliminated this too:</p><p>Then we remove <code>dD</code> and the final string should be:</p><h3 id="my-solution">My Solution</h3><p>To solve this I wrote two functions, one that <code>process</code> takes array of characters, traverse the array a pair at a time and validate that they follow the rules mentioned above:</p><h4 id="rust">Rust</h4><hr><div><pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>fn</span> <span>process</span>(tokens: <span>&amp;</span><span>mut</span> Vec<span>&lt;</span>String<span>&gt;</span>) -&gt; <span>i32</span> {

My first reaction (in an act of self denial) was to check the compiler flags <code>opt-level</code> and after checking that was fine, which to be honest won’t make a difference, I started to look for inefficiencies in the code, first using the ancient <a href="http://www.brendangregg.com/methodology.html">Drunk man anti-method</a> technique and when that didn’t work, I end up settling for a more scientific method of profiling my code with <a href="https://perf.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/Main_Page">perf</a>.</p><h2 id="debugging">Debugging</h2><hr><p>Every time you are debugging a performance issues you might feel tempted to start adding your own function to calculate the duration of suspicious section of code (like I used to do, in the past). <a href="http://www.brendangregg.com/perf.html">Perf</a> does this for you by taking various approaches such as listening to CPU/Kernel <a href="https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/6/html/developer_guide/perf">performance events</a> metrics emitted by the system in reaction of your process while running.

But this leaves me with some questions:</p><blockquote><p>The <code>91ms</code> is not bad, but I wonder how much effort it will take to optimize this code to make it <code>&gt;1.5x</code> faster than the Javascript counterpart?</p></blockquote><h2 id="performance-on-macos">Performance On MacOS</h2><p>While I was thinking of this and was in the middle of unpacking my Rust stickers and preparing my laptop for some re-branding, I decided to move the code (Javascript and Rust) from my Linux VM to my main OS (<strong>MacOS Catalina</strong>), once there I gave the benchmark another try because I <em>love</em> suffering:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="sh">Node   0.17s user 0.03s system 101% cpu 0.209 total

Does this make it more expensive to get performance out of Rust? Did I choose the wrong abstractions? That's for another post.

February 11, 2021 | https://www.honeybadger.io/blog/subdomain-takeover/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.honeybadger.io/blog/subdomain-takeover/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
          <article>
            <p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Name_System">Domain Name System (DNS)</a> is often described as
the address book of the Internet;
A and AAAA records map a human-friendly hostname (e.g., <code>honeybadger.io</code>)
to some machine-friendly IP address (<code>104.198.14.52</code>, in this case).
Other types of DNS records also exist; in particular,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNAME_record">CNAME records</a> are records that map a hostname to some other hostname,
thereby delegating IP resolution to the latter.</p>

<p>Unsurprisingly, DNS is not immune to misconfiguration,
and poor DNS hygiene opens the door to all kinds of abuse
that can wreak havoc on the security of your organization and its stakeholders.
Of course, if attackers gain access to your DNS configuration and
are able to create records or modify existing ones,</p>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdqyG3CcoLM">That's it, man! Game over, man! Game over!</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>However, attackers don't need such a strong foothold in your system
to cause harm.
In some cases, a dangling CNAME record on one of your subdomains is all they
need to take control of some (or all) of the content served
by the subdomain in question.
Such a security issue is known as a <em>subdomain takeover</em>.</p>

<p>In this post, I will do the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>show you how subdomain takeovers typically arise,</li>
<li>explain why this type of security issue should be on your radar,</li>
<li>delve into how an attacker may use a subdomain takeover against you,</li>
<li>provide some guidance for protecting yourself
against vulnerabilities of this kind.</li>
</ul>

<h2>A Typical Scenario</h2>

<p>To fix ideas, let's go over a typical subdomain-takeover scenario.
Let's assume that your organization, ExampleDotOrg,
whose domain name is <code>example.org</code>,
wants to use some service from a vendor called TipTop.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.honeybadger.io/images/blog/posts/subdomain-takeover/scenario.svg?1613353705" alt="typical scenario">
<em>A typical subdomain-takeover scenario</em></p>

<ol>
<li>You register an account at TipTop and create an instance of their service,
which is accessible at <code>example-dot-org.tiptopapp.com</code>.</li>
<li>For brand-consistency reasons,
your organization would like to make your TipTop instance accessible
from one of its subdomains: <code>tiptop.example.org</code>.
No problem, as TipTop allows you to do that.
All you have to do is create a CNAME record that points <code>tiptop.example.org</code>
to <code>example-dot-org.tiptopapp.com</code>.</li>
<li>After a while, your organization decides to cancel its TipTop subscription.
Your TipTop instance is then deleted but, crucially, you forget to remove
the associated CNAME record!</li>
<li>An attacker later notices the dangling CNAME record.
Because TipTop doesn't prevent anyone from
reclaiming the <code>example-dot-org</code> instance name on their platform,
the attacker is able to create his or her own TipTop instance at
<code>example-dot-org.tiptopapp.com</code>,
which your subdomain <code>tiptop.example.org</code> now points to!
From then on, and for as long as the CNAME record remains,
the attacker has control over the content served by your subdomain.</li>
</ol>

<p>You've just fallen victim to a subdomain takeover!</p>

<h2>Why You Should Pay Attention</h2>

<p>Subdomain takeover was pioneered by ethical hacker <a href="https://twitter.com/fransrosen">Frans Rosén</a> and
popularized by <a href="https://detectify.com/">Detectify</a> in a <a href="https://labs.detectify.com/2014/10/21/hostile-subdomain-takeover-using-herokugithubdesk-more/">seminal blogpost</a>
as early as 2014.
However, it remains an underestimated (or outright overlooked)
and widespread vulnerability.
The rise of cloud solutions certainly hasn't helped curb the spread.</p>

<p>In many ways, subdomain takeover is an insidious security issue:</p>

<ul>
<li>Finding out whether a subdomain takeover is possible
and taking control of the subdomain
typically require remarkably few technical skills from the attacker.</li>
<li>Detecting that a subdomain takeover is being actively exploited
is difficult; you may realize it too late, when your users start complaining.</li>
<li>A subdomain takeover may pose a relatively minor threat in itself, but
when combined with other seemingly minor security misconfigurations,
it may allow an attacker to cause greater damage.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Impact of a Subdomain Takeover</h2>

<p>What harm could a subdomain takeover bring to your organization? Well, the impact mainly depends on three factors:</p>

<p><strong>The nature of the third-party service (if any) that the vulnerable
  subdomain points to.</strong>
  Does the vendor offer little to no customization,
  or does it allow you to modify the style of the landing page via custom
  JavaScript or CSS code?
  Does it restrict you to serving static content,
  or is it a full-blown platform-as-a-service (PaaS) offering
  on which you can deploy a Web server?</p>

<p><strong>The purpose and popularity of the vulnerable subdomain.</strong>
  What was the subdomain used for before becoming vulnerable?
  Was it used to simply host API documentation
  or was it instead used to authenticate users?
  Is the subdomain still receiving traffic?
  Is the subdomain name long and obscure (e.g., <code>exctxzzxxp09.test.example.org</code>)
  or short and simple and, thus, unlikely to raise suspicion
  (e.g., <code>auth.example.org</code>)?</p>

<p><strong>The trust relationship that the organization's other Web assets
  have with the vulnerable subdomain.</strong>
  Would <code>example.org</code> blindly trust requests originating
  from the vulnerable subdomain?
  Would it accept to share sensitive data with that subdomain?
  Would it accept to load and execute JavaScript code hosted on that subdomain?</p>

<p>Now that you have a better idea of what factors into the impact of a subdomain takeover, let's see how a malicious actor might exploit one.</p>

<h3>Defacement</h3>

<p>If possible, an attacker may decide to change the appearance of pages
served by the vulnerable <code>example.org</code> subdomain
to openly ridicule or embarrass your organization.
This is exactly <a href="https://grahamcluley.com/hacker-defaces-donald-trump-fundraising-site-via-subdomain-takeover-attack/">what happened in February 2017</a>,
when a hacker took control of <code>secure2.donaldjtrump.com</code>,
a subdomain of Donald Trump's campaign-fundraising website,
and left there a message that...
well... did not really fall in line with the Trump campaign's strategy.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.honeybadger.io/images/blog/posts/subdomain-takeover/trump_hacked.png?1613353705" alt="Trump gets pwned">
<em>Defacement of Trump's campaign fundraising site thanks to a subdomain takeover</em></p>

<p>Although the issue was quickly resolved,
the offending page was captured and
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170219165347/http://secure2.donaldjtrump.com/">persists in the Internet Archive's Wayback Machine</a> to this day.
This incident arguably was neither the first nor the last cause for
embarrassment for Trump,
and it certainly did not prevent him from winning the 2016 presidency—as
he was already in office at the time.
However, I'm sure you can imagine how a defacement,
possibly consisting of more offensive content than Trump's hacker used,
could harm your organization's reputation.</p>

<h3>Phishing</h3>

<p>Another obvious way to exploit a subdomain vulnerable to takeover is phishing.
Most phishing sites masquerading as a legitimate site (e.g., <code>payments.example.org</code>)
usually do not survive close scrutiny of the browser's address bar
because phishers typically have no other option than to host them
on a lookalike domain (e.g., <code>payments.exarnple.org</code>).
Not so with a subdomain takeover!
In fact, a subdomain takeover is the perfect spot for running a phishing campaign.
After all, if the domain name <code>example.org</code> is trustworthy,
then one would assume that any subdomain of <code>example.org</code> is also trustworthy, right?</p>

<p>Thanks to a subdomain takeover,
phishers can readily leverage the reputation of the legitimate domain name
to lure unsuspecting victims to it and elicit sensitive information
(e.g., account credentials, personally identifiable information, and payment details)
from them.
Even tech-savvy visitors are likely to fall for the subterfuge.</p>

<p>In some cases, attackers may even be able to obtain and install a valid TLS
certificate for the vulnerable subdomain
to serve their phishing site over HTTPS;
and, sad to say, many people
(including <a href="https://twitter.com/Europol/status/1214557374180020224">Europol representatives</a>, who should know better),
still view the use of HTTPS as a reliable indicator for trustworthiness
of the server on the other end of the connection.</p>

<h3>Stealing Broadly Scoped Cookies</h3>

<p>Run-of-the-mill phishing typically requires some gullibility and
user interaction (beyond navigating to the malicious site) from the victim.
A subdomain takeover is more powerful, though, as it may enable an attacker
to steal sensitive cookies simply by the victim visiting the attacker's site.</p>

<p>Cookies have a <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Set-Cookie#Attributes"><code>Domain</code> attribute</a>,
which determines where browsers are allowed to send them in HTTP requests.
For instance, if a cookie is set from <code>example.org</code> with that hostname
as the value of its <code>Domain</code> attribute,
browsers will attach it to all HTTP requests sent to <code>example.org</code>
or any subdomain thereof.
Some sites, in a questionnable approach to implementing
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_sign-on">Single-Sign-On (SSO) authentication</a> across all of their subdomains,
set the <code>Domain</code> attribute of their session-identifying cookies to their root
domain (<code>example.org</code>).</p>

<p>Now picture a malicious actor who has taken control over a subdomain and
deploys their own malicious server there, which is set up to log all HTTP requests.
By luring authenticated users to the compromised subdomain,
the attacker will be able to harvest cookies scoped at the root domain
simply by inspecting the server logs!</p>

<p><img src="https://www.honeybadger.io/images/blog/posts/subdomain-takeover/cookies.svg?1613353705" alt="Cookie theft">
<em>Exploiting a subdomain takeover to steal sensitive cookies</em></p>

<p>If session-identifying cookies are scoped this way,
the attacker will be able to hijack user sessions and, perhaps, even take over
user accounts.</p>

<p>Note that security cookie attributes cannot protect users
who happen to visit the compromised subdomain. In particular,</p>

<ul>
<li>the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Set-Cookie#Attributes"><code>HttpOnly</code> cookie attribute</a> is irrelevant here
because the attack involves no client-side JavaScript;</li>
<li>under the assumption that the subdomain has a valid TLS certificate,
the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Set-Cookie#Attributes"><code>Secure</code> cookie attribute</a> cannot be of any help
because browsers will send cookies to the compromised subdomain,
even over HTTPS.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Cross-Site Request Forgery</h3>

<p><a href="https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/csrf">OWASP defines cross-site request forgery</a> as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Cross-site request forgery (CSRF) is an attack that forces an end
user to execute unwanted actions on a web application in which [he
or she is] currently authenticated.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Let's take a social network as an example.
A CSRF attacker may perform sensitive actions, such as</p>

<ul>
<li>liking another user's post,</li>
<li>updating the victim's email address, or</li>
<li>changing the victim's profile picture,</li>
</ul>

<p>all on behalf of the victim but against his or her will.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Set-Cookie/SameSite"><code>SameSite</code> cookie attribute</a> was introduced to protect users
against such cross-site attacks,
but few organizations are taking full advantage of it.
Thus, CSRF remains a risk wherever cookie-based …</p></article></div></div>

February 11, 2021 | https://altcampus.school/community/posts/how-to-get-first-job-as-a-software-developer-when-you-have-zero-experience | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://altcampus.school/community/posts/how-to-get-first-job-as-a-software-developer-when-you-have-zero-experience">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><img src="https://altcampus.school/images/posts/how-to-get-first-job-as-a-developer-when-you-have-zero-experience.png" alt="How to get first job as a developer when you have zero experience - AltCampus"></p>
<p>Most companies want to hire experienced developers but how do you become experienced until you get the first job? This is the classic chicken and egg problem version of tech jobs. Everyone needs to start somewhere.</p>
<p>First, let's understand why most companies want to hire experienced developers. It's becuase with experienced developers companies don't need to invest much time or mentorship in order to get them to be productive. They get the work done. Whereas junior developers usually need lot of handholding, time, and upfront mentorship. It either slows the companies down or needs more investment from them.</p>
<p>That said, you can get the first job even as a junior developer by showing the proof that you know stuff, can build things and can learn quickly. It's all about signaling the right stuff.</p>
<p>Here's how -</p>
<h3>1. Build a portfolio</h3>
<p>Build good projects, ideally outside of a tutorial, that showcase what you are actually capable of building. Make sure it has a live URL that people can checkout. It proves that you can actually ship a project end-to-end.</p>
<p>Here are some detailed tips on <a href="https://altcampus.io/blog/how-to-build-a-great-portfolio-as-a-beginner-developer">how to build a great portfolio</a>.</p>
<h3>2. Become good at writing code and problem solving</h3>
<p>This is reflected in your Github repositories. Make sure that you refactor your code and follow good practices. Simple stuff like</p>
<ul>
<li>Writing good variable, function names</li>
<li>Breaking down big functions into smaller, reusable functions</li>
<li>Making sure that the code and modules are well structured and documented</li>
</ul>
<p>goes a long way.</p>
<h3>3. Pay attention to the details</h3>
<p>This is critical. A major difference between junior and experienced developers is that experienced developers are used to paying attention to the details like handling edge cases because they have burnt their fingers in the past. Similarly as a frontend developer, pay special attention to the details of the UI.</p>
<p>Paying attention to the details signals that you are the kind of person who cares about the quality of your work and are diligent. A quality that can make you stand out even as a junior developer.</p>
<h3>4. Learn and share stuff in public</h3>
<p>Tweet, write blog posts and share what you learnt. This is a very good way of showcasing your knowledge and passion for learning. It also builds a network where you can get referred or people might show interest in hiring you, without you even looking for it.</p>
<p>For example, pick up a new library/framework/tool in the relevant language. Read the official documentation and other articles and try to build a project around it and share your learnings online. This shows that you can learn new skills quickly and can also communicate about it.</p>
<h3>5. Apply. Apply. Apply.</h3>
<p>Once you have a deployed project that is complete either in frontend, backend or full-stack, you should start applying. Read up <a href="https://github.com/yangshun/tech-interview-handbook/">frequently asked questions in interviews</a>.</p>
<p>Apply to various companies. It's inevitable that you will get rejected at some places. Don't get disheartened, there are thousands of companies hiring. Learn from the mistakes in previous interviews and keep applying.</p>
<p>Good luck. 🙌</p>

This new approach to writing code triggered incredible innovation in how to handle state changes and UI updates.</p><p>This revolution had its downsides, too. One of them was a culture of over-engineering solutions to challenges that could be solved in simpler ways. A typical example of this is how state has been managed in React applications.</p><p>Redux has become a hallmark of many React applications created in the last couple of years.

Finally, we’ll look into what might be coming in the future.</p><h2 id="redux---and-why-people-started-using-it">Redux - and why people started using it</h2><p>When it was first released , React didn’t have an officially supported way to pass data far down the component tree. If you had some kind of shared state, configuration or other information you would like to use anywhere in you application, you had to pass it down from parent to child to sibling to another child. There <em>was</em> a way to avoid it, but that way - the “legacy context API” was never officially supported, and was documented with a warning that it should not be used.</p><p>About the same time React was released to the public, some other Facebook engineers <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?list=PLb0IAmt7-GS188xDYE-u1ShQmFFGbrk0v&amp;v=nYkdrAPrdcw&amp;feature=emb_title" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">introduced a blueprint</a> for how they created front end applications - the <a href="https://facebook.github.io/flux/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Flux architecture</a>.

The actions were sent to a “reducer” function, which returned a brand new copy of the entire application state, which would then propagate across your application.</p><p>Another great feature of Redux was how easy it was to use with React. Not only was it a great match with the programming model of React, it also solved the prop drilling issue! Just “connect” whatever component you want to a store, and you had access to any part of the application state you wanted. It was like magic!</p><h2 id="context-hooks-and-why-it-solved-much-of-what-redux-did">Context, hooks, and why it solved much of what Redux did</h2><p>With all its elegance and popularity though, Redux did have a few major downsides. For each new way of changing the state, you had to add a new action type and action creator, probably a dispatcher and a selector, and then you’d have to handle that new state change in an existing reducer, or create a new one. In other words - lots and lots of boilerplate.</p><p>When the 16.3 version of React was released, it finally shipped with a fully redesigned context API. With this new feature, prop drilling was suddenly as easy as wrapping any subsection of your application in a context provider, and fetching it again with a context consumer component.  Here’s an example of how that could be done:</p><div><pre><p><span>1</span><span>const</span><span> </span><span>UserContext</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>React</span><span>.</span><span>createContext</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>2</span><span></span><span>class</span><span> </span><span>MyApp</span><span> </span><span>extends</span><span> </span><span>React</span><span>.</span><span>Component</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>3</span><span>  state </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span> user</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>null</span><span> </span><span>}</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>4</span><span>  </span><span>componentDidMount</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>5</span><span>    myApi</span><span>.</span><span>getUser</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span></span></p><p><span>6</span><span>      </span><span>.</span><span>then</span><span>(</span><span>user</span><span> </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> </span><span>this</span><span>.</span><span>setState</span><span>(</span><span>{</span><span> user </span><span>}</span><span>)</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>7</span><span>  </span><span>}</span><span></span></p><p><span>8</span><span>  </span><span>render</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>9</span><span>    </span><span>return</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span></span></p><p><span>10</span><span>      </span><span>&lt;</span><span>UserContext</span><span>.</span><span>Provider</span><span> value</span><span>=</span><span>{</span><span>this</span><span>.</span><span>state</span><span>.</span><span>user</span><span>}</span><span>&gt;</span><span></span></p><p><span>11</span><span>        </span><span>&lt;</span><span>SomeDeepHierarchy</span><span> </span><span>/</span><span>&gt;</span><span></span></p><p><span>12</span><span>      </span><span>&lt;</span><span>/</span><span>UserContext</span><span>.</span><span>Provider</span><span>&gt;</span><span></span></p><p><span>13</span><span>    </span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>14</span><span>  </span><span>}</span><span></span></p><p><span>15</span><span></span><span>}</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>16</span><span></span><span>const</span><span> </span><span>UserGreeting</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>17</span><span>  </span><span>return</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span></span></p><p><span>18</span><span>    </span><span>&lt;</span><span>UserContext</span><span>.</span><span>Consumer</span><span>&gt;</span><span></span></p><p><span>19</span><span>      </span><span>{</span><span>user</span><span> </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span> </span><span></span></p><p><span>20</span><span>        </span><span>&lt;</span><span>p</span><span>&gt;</span><span>Hello</span><span> there</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>user</span><span>.</span><span>name</span><span> </span><span>||</span><span> </span><span>'customer'</span><span>}</span><span>!</span><span>&lt;</span><span>/</span><span>p</span><span>&gt;</span><span></span></p><p><span>21</span><span>      </span><span>)</span><span>}</span><span></span></p><p><span>22</span><span>    </span><span>&lt;</span><span>/</span><span>UserContext</span><span>.</span><span>Consumer</span><span>&gt;</span><span></span></p><p><span>23</span><span>  </span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>24</span><span></span><span>}</span><span>;</span></p></pre></div><p>At ReactConf in 2018, now React Core team member Dan Abramov and boss Sophie Alpert <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V-QO-KO90iQ&amp;t=5s" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">introduced a new feature</a> in React - hooks. Hooks made using state and side effects much easier, and made away with the need for class components altogether.

The elegance of reducers were suddenly built into React itself, and prop-drilling was a solved challenge. New projects were started without having Redux in the stack - a previous no-brainer - and more and more projects started to consider moving away from Redux altogether.</p><p>As a response, the team currently maintaining Redux (led by a gentleman named Mark Eriksson) started two different efforts. They introduced an opinionated toolkit named <a href="https://redux-toolkit.js.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Redux Toolkit</a> that did away with most boilerplate code through conventions, and they added a <a href="https://react-redux.js.org/api/hooks" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">hooks-based API</a> for reading state and dispatching actions.</p><p>Together these two new updates simplified Redux codebases substantially. But is it really enough to defend introducing the added complexity of the concepts in Redux to a new project? Is the value Redux adds more than the added cost of teaching new employees about Yet Another Tool?</p><p>Let’s look at where React does a great job by itself, and in what cases the tradeoff of complexity vs power is worth it.</p><h2 id="when-react-is-enough">When React is enough</h2><p>Most React applications I’ve worked with have been pretty small in scope. They’ve had a few global pieces of state that was used across the application, and some data that was shared across a few different views.</p><p>Besides from this though, many React applications don’t have a lot of shared state. Most state  like the content of input fields or whether a modal is open, is only interesting to the component that contains them! No need to make that state globally available. </p><p>Other pieces of state might be shared, but only by a part of the application. Perhaps a particular page requires a piece of state to be shared across several of its components, or a sidebar needs to expose some remote status to all of its children. Either way, that’s not global state - it’s state scoped to a part of the application.</p><p>By keeping state co-located, or as close to its dependents as possible, you ensure that it’s deleted whenever the feature requiring it is deleted, and that it’s discoverable without leafing through tens of different reducers.</p><p>If you need to share app-wide settings that rarely change, React’s context API is a great tool to reach for. One example of this is what locale is currently active:</p><div><pre><p><span>1</span><span>const</span><span> </span><span>LocaleContext</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>React</span><span>.</span><span>createContext</span><span>(</span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>2</span><span>  locale</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"en-US"</span><span>,</span><span></span></p><p><span>3</span><span>  </span><span>setLocale</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>}</span><span>,</span><span></span></p><p><span>4</span><span></span><span>}</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>5</span><span></span><span>const</span><span> </span><span>LocaleProvider</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>props</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>6</span><span>  </span><span>const</span><span> </span><span>[</span><span>locale</span><span>,</span><span> setLocale</span><span>]</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>React</span><span>.</span><span>useState</span><span>(</span><span>"en-US"</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>7</span><span>  </span><span>return</span><span> </span><span>&lt;</span><span>LocaleContext</span><span>.</span><span>Provider</span><span> value</span><span>=</span><span>{</span><span>{</span><span> locale</span><span>,</span><span> setLocale </span><span>}</span><span>}</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>...</span><span>props</span><span>}</span><span> </span><span>/</span><span>&gt;</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>8</span><span></span><span>}</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>9</span><span></span><span>const</span><span> </span><span>useLocale</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> </span><span>React</span><span>.</span><span>useContext</span><span>(</span><span>LocaleContext</span><span>)</span><span>;</span></p></pre></div><p>Other use cases can be what color theme is active, or even what experiments are active for a given user.</p><p>Another very useful approach is using a small data-fetching library like <a href="https://swr.vercel.app/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">SWR</a> or <a href="https://react-query.tanstack.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">React-Query</a> to handle fetching and caching your API responses for you. To me, cached data isn’t really global state - it’s just cached data. This is much simpler to handle with these small single-use libraries, than introducing async thunks or sagas to your Redux rig. Also, you don’t have to handle all the complex variations of isLoading, hasError and what not. With these libraries, it works out of the box.</p><p>A thing these context use cases have in common is the fact that they represent data that rarely updates. Rarely in the context of computer science is a bit vague, but in my mind, less than a couple of times every second is pretty rare. And as it turns out, that’s the way the React Context API works best!</p><p>The use cases summarized above covers most of the situations I’ve met in real world applications. Actual global state is rare and far between, and is often better off being co-located with the code that actually uses it, or provided through the context API.</p><h2 id="situations-where-redux-might-be-warranted">Situations where Redux might be warranted</h2><p>With all that said, Redux is still a great product. It’s well documented, adopted by many, and can be combined with the approaches posted above. But what use cases warrants the added complexity and learning curve of adding Redux to your stack in 2021?</p><p>One of the use cases I see most in the projects I’m involved with is when you have advanced data fetching scenarios that requires a lot of cascading network communication. One might argue that this is best done on the server side, but there are definitely use cases where handing this on the client is warranted. Redux, particularly in combination with so-called thunks, is extremely versatile and flexible when it comes to such orchestration.</p><p>Another use case is for very interdependent states, or states that are derived from several other states. This is possible to handle in React as well, but the end result is still much easier to both share, reuse and reason about in Redux.</p><p>A third use case is for those where the state of your application can change very rapidly.

<div>

<p><strong>Update 1:58 AM PT:</strong> <em>Updated the post to clear confusion about how Google’s Safe Browsing feature works.</em></p>
<hr>
<p>Apple’s privacy push is much more widespread than it seems at the surface. A perfect example is the new privacy feature in <a href="https://the8-bit.com/ios-14-5-changes/">iOS 14.5 Beta 1 (V2)</a> which redirects Google Safe Browsing traffic through Apple’s own proxy servers to enhance users’ privacy and to not let Google see your IP address. </p>
<p>Google Safe Browsing is a security service created by Google that checks whether a website is malicious. When you access a website on the desktop version of Chrome on your Mac or PC, for instance, Google Safe Browsing checks if a website is safe to browse and displays a warning accordingly. The user ultimately has the choice, however.</p>
<p>As Reddit user u/jaydenkieran explains, Apple uses Google Safe Browsing when you enable “Fraudulent Website Warning” within the Safari settings in the Settings app on iPhone or iPad.</p>
<p><a aria-label="According to Google (opens in a new tab)" href="https://support.google.com/transparencyreport/answer/7380435?hl=en#zippy=%2Chow-do-you-determine-that-a-site-is-unsafe" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">According to Google</a>, its Safe Browsing system works by scanning sections of Google’s web index and “identifying potentially compromised websites.” Then, Google tests those websites by using a virtual machine to check if the website compromises the system. If it does, it’s added to Google’s online database. Google also identifies phishing websites by using statistical models. </p>
<p><a aria-label="According to Apple (opens in a new tab)" href="https://support.apple.com/en-ae/HT210675" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">According to Apple</a>, before visiting a website, Safari may send hashed prefixes of the URL (Apple terms it “information calculated from the website address”) to Google Safe Browsing to check if there’s a match. </p>
<p>Since Apple uses a hashed prefix, Google cannot learn which website the user is trying to visit. Up until iOS 14.5, Google could also see the IP address of where that request is coming from. However, since Apple now proxies Google Safe Browsing traffic, it further safeguards users’ privacy while browsing using Safari.</p>
<p>Apple has been intensifying its push for privacy with iOS 14 what with the <a href="https://the8-bit.com/app-tracking-transparency-guide/">App Tracking Transparency update and the inclusion of App Privacy Reports in the App Store</a>. </p><div><p>See also</p><div id="block-wrap-86835" data-id="86835" data-base="0"><div><div><div><article><div><p><a href="https://the8-bit.com/siri-now-allows-setting-a-default-music-streaming-service-on-ios-14-5/" title="Siri_Default_Music_App"><img width="100" height="100" src="https://the8-bit.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Siri_Default_Music_App-100x100.jpg" alt="Siri Default Music App" srcset="https://the8-bit.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Siri_Default_Music_App-100x100.jpg 100w, https://the8-bit.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Siri_Default_Music_App-80x80.jpg 80w, https://the8-bit.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Siri_Default_Music_App-293x293.jpg 293w" sizes="(max-width: 100px) 100vw, 100px"></a></p></div></article></div></div></div></div></div>
<p>At the same time, companies like Facebook are actively opposing the Cupertino giant, accusing it of negatively affecting the advertising industry. Apple’s response has been simple: </p>
<p>“We believe that this is a simple matter of standing up for our users. Users should know when their data is being collected and shared across other apps and websites — and they should have the choice to allow that or not. App Tracking Transparency in iOS 14 does not require Facebook to change its approach to tracking users and creating targeted advertising, it simply requires they give users a choice.” </p>
<p>Google itself <a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/21/02/04/google-still-hasnt-updated-its-ios-apps-while-pondering-android-privacy-controls" target="_blank" aria-label="had been holding off (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">had been holding off</a> on updating its host of apps on the App Store due to the App Privacy Health Reports in the App Store that lets users view how an app tracks them. However, Google later disclosed that it will update its apps to include as little tracking as possible.</p>
<p>Having said that, it’s interesting to see Apple focus on enhancing user privacy as much as they can. And setting up a proxy server to filter Google Safe Browsing traffic just so Google cannot see users’ browsing activity will be a welcome move for a lot of users.</p>

It will be upgraded from version 1.12.4 to 3.5.1.</p><h4>For non tech folks, here is a quick intro on jQuery</h4><p>jQuery is a fast, small, and feature-rich JavaScript library. It makes things like HTML document traversal and manipulation, event handling, animation, and Ajax much simpler with an easy-to-use API that works across a multitude of browsers.</p><p>With a combination of versatility and extensibility, jQuery has changed the way that millions of people write JavaScript.</p><h3><em>WordPress 5.7</em></h3><blockquote><p>WordPress 5.7 is scheduled to release on March 9, 2021</p></blockquote><p>You can checkout their plan roundup <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2020/12/21/wordpress-5-7-planning-roundup/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p><p>Actually they started <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2020/06/29/updating-jquery-version-shipped-with-wordpress/" target="_blank">testing</a> before they released WordPress 5.5 and I was kinda expecting it to be released in the WordPress releases 5.5 or 5.6.

<p><em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> developers <a href="https://veryaligaming.com/2021/02/cyberpunk-2077-developers-cd-projekt-red-hacked/"><strong>CD Projekt Red</strong> were hacked</a> by an unknown actor two days ago.</p>



<p>The hackers threatened that non-compliance would lead to the stolen files being leaked online. The leaks would include the source code for all of their recent games.<br>Following <strong>CD Projekt Red</strong>‘s refusal to comply the leaking has now begun, starting with <em>Gwent</em>, – a free-to-play digital card game.</p>



<p>According to a&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://cybernews.com/news/cyberpunk-2077-maker-cd-projekt-red-gwent-source-code-leaked-after-ransomware-attack/" rel="noopener">Cybernews report</a>, the hackers posted the obtained files for&nbsp;<em>Gwent</em>&nbsp;on a hacking forum, which included a download link to a MEGA.nz archive.<br><em>CD Projekt Leak #1</em>&nbsp;was the name of the file. Predictably, it seems this leak is the first of many.&nbsp;<br>This download also contained a read-me file which suggested more leaks would be coming the following day (today).</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <p>An exploration of grid system design space, and an alternative to the typical options like H3 and S2.</p>



<p>A global grid system is a way of partitioning the Earth’s surface into smaller regions, often known as <em>cells</em>. Depending on your perspective and preferred nomenclature, global grids may be closely related to or the same as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrete_global_grid">discrete global grids</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spatial_database#Spatial_index">[geo]spatial indices</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Address_geocoding">geocode systems</a>, etc. The most well known examples are probably <a href="https://eng.uber.com/h3/">Uber’s H3</a>, <a href="http://s2geometry.io/">Google’s S2</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geohash">Geohash</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Location_Code">Open Location Code</a>.</p>

<p>From my day job at <a href="https://evanfields.github.io/No-Perfect-Geo-Grid/www.zoba.com">Zoba</a>, I’m most familiar with grid systems as a convenient tool for splitting a city into cells of approximately uniform shape and size; these cells become a unit of analysis. For example, if you want to characterize the spatial distribution of shared bikes over a city, it’s natural to simply count how many bikes are in each grid cell. In fact, many of our analyses and optimizations are at the cell level: we count vehicles and rides by cell, estimate and forecast demand by cell, estimate the prevalence of mobility competition by cell, and so forth.</p>

<p>It’s against the law to write a blog post about maps without liberal use of visuals, so let’s get started.[<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>] I’ll use H3 as an example, both because it’s something of a de facto standard and because it’s easy to use. These are probably related. Here’s how H3 divides North America into very coarse cells:</p>

<p><img src="https://evanfields.github.io/images/geogrids/h3_north_america.png" alt="North America" title="North America covered by H3 resolution 2 cells"></p>

<p>(The majority of the apparent distortion in cell size and shape comes from the web Mercator projection used in Kepler and approximately everywhere else on the web.)</p>

<p>Pretty much every grid system offers multiple resolutions. High resolutions (or precision levels, or granularities) correspond to partitioning the Earth’s surface into many small cells; low resolutions correspond to a few big cells. For example, here’s Boston with two sizes of H3 cells. I’ve plotted a large cell by the public garden and seven smaller cells by MIT. Collectively, the seven small cells have the same area as the large cell.</p>

<p><img src="https://evanfields.github.io/images/geogrids/h3_boston.png" alt="Boston" title="Boston with H3 resolution 8 and 9 cells"></p>



<p>Creating a global grid system requires lots of design decisions: how is the Earth’s surface (not flat, despite my best efforts) projected to flat surfaces? What kind of planar grid overlays those flat surfaces? Or maybe a projection-free grid is possible? How are cells shaped and oriented? What resolutions are available, and how do they relate to each other?</p>

<p>The best design choices are surely context dependent, but we can list some reasonable desiderata for a general purpose global grid system:</p>
<ol>
  <li>All cells at a given resolution have equal size, or at least nearly equal.</li>
  <li>All cells have the same shape, and that shape is close to a convex regular polygon.</li>
  <li>All neighbors of a given cell are at the same distance from that cell.</li>
  <li>Multiple cell resolutions are available, and each cell is perfectly partitioned by cells of a finer resolution.</li>
  <li>The grid system covers the entire earth, and each point on the earth is in exactly one cell of a given granularity. In other words, the grid system is not made up of overlapping mutually-incompatible subgrids.</li>
</ol>

<p>Unfortunately, these design goals conflict with each other. Let’s try to design a grid system that satisfies them. Start with desideratum #2, that cells are regular polygons. The Earth is approximately spherical, and up close spheres look like planes. So our cells must tile the plane. If our cells are regular convex polygons, that means cells must be equilateral triangles, squares, or regular hexagons.</p>

<p>Triangles and squares violate goal #4 by having different flavors of neighbors. For example, a square cell (in green below) has both edge-neighbors (red) and corner-neighbors (blue); the corner neighbors are much farther away:</p>

<p><img src="https://evanfields.github.io/images/geogrids/square_neighbors.svg" alt="Square neighbors" title="Neighbors of a square cell"></p>

<p>Triangles are even worse, with three types of neighbors. Hexagons, on the other hand, have only one kind of neighbor. In a hexagonal tiling of the plane, each hexagon cell (green) has six neighbors (blue), which correspond to the cell’s six edges and are each at the same distance away:</p>

<p><img src="https://evanfields.github.io/images/geogrids/hex_neighbors.svg" alt="Hexagon neighbors" title="Neighbors of a hexagonal cell"></p>

<p>So maybe we should use hexagons? While I do believe hexagons are the best choice for general use, they’re not perfect either. In particular, they don’t subdivide perfectly. With square[-ish] cells, each cell can be perfectly subdivided into 4 similar sub-cells. But hexagons can’t be subdivided into similar smaller hexagons; the best strategy I know of comes from H3, which approximately divides each hexagon into 7 smaller rotated hexagons.</p>

<p><img src="https://evanfields.github.io/images/geogrids/subdiv.svg" alt="Cell subdivision" title="Cell subdivision"></p>

<p>So we’ve reached a contradiction. Regular polygon grid cells implies triangle, square, or hexagon cells. Each cell having just one kind of neighbor implies hexagonal cells, but each cell subdividing nicely implies not hexagonal cells. ⇒⇐</p>

<p>Maybe we shouldn’t have been using convex regular polygons? There are definitely exotic plane tiling schemes that don’t rely on regular polygons, but regular polygons are important because they minimize the perimeter to area ratio. One of many reasons this is important: location data is often imprecise. Let’s say you know locations only up to ± 10 meters, mabye due to GPS limitations. Then any time you think a point is less than 10 meters from a cell boundary, you should be worried that the point is actually in a neighboring cell. To minimize this situation, we’d want to minimize the perimeter to area ratio, which pushes us towards regular polygons. For example, consider a very spiky rhombus type shape: almost the whole area is near the boundary.</p>

<p>There are other subtle tensions between these five goals. Because the Earth is not flat, projecting the earth to a [collection of] flat spaces does involve some distortion, even for very clever projections such as those used by S2 and H3. These distortions will end up creating some variability between cells: not all cells will be the same size and shape. For example, even though H3 uses a very clever projection, at each resolution the largest cell in the world has area about twice that of the smallest cell. (Nearby cells have approximately the same area.) Check out some <a href="https://observablehq.com/@nrabinowitz/h3-area-stats">measurements</a> and a <a href="https://observablehq.com/@nrabinowitz/h3-area-variation">cool visualization which reveals the projection structure</a>.</p>

<h2 id="s2-and-h3">S2 and H3</h2>
<p>Google’s S2 and Uber’s H3 navigate the inevitable design tradeoffs slightly differently:</p>

<p><strong>S2</strong> projects the Earth’s surface to a cube, which corresponds to dividing the surface into six square-like shapes bounded by geodesics. Each square-like shape is then recursively divided into smaller squares. This strategy gives cells which are perfectly partitioned by cells at a higher resolution, but comes with the expected downsides of square-ish cells: different flavors of cell neighbors, higher perimeter/volume ratio than a hexagon would have, etc. In some parts of the world, the cells assume a more rhombus like shape, I think. I’m not sure how cell area varies over the world.</p>

<p><strong>H3</strong> projects the Earth’s surface to an icosahedron and then does a soccer-ball type pentagon and hexagon tessellation. At every resolution there are exactly 12 pentagons, and the icosahedron orientation is carefully chosen to put all 12 pentagons in the oceans. So unless you’re using very coarse cells or doing world-wide ocean mapping, in practice all cells you encounter will be hexagons. The carefully chosen projection orientation means that the orientation of individual hex cells is beyond the user’s control.</p>

<p>As we’ve seen, hexagons have nice neighbor properties but don’t subdivide cleanly. Also, each H3 resolution level changes hexagon area by a factor of 7 (i.e. a hexagon cell is approximately subdivided by 7 smaller cells at one resolution higher). This means the user has quite little control over cell size, especially because of the aforementioned variability in cell size at a given resolution.</p>



<p>Recall the 5th desideratum from above:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>The grid system covers the entire earth, and each point on the earth is in exactly one cell of a given granularity. In other words, the grid system is not made up of overlapping mutually-incompatible subgrids.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This requirement is entirely reasonable; consider what happens if we relax this constraint and allow our grid system to be a collection of overlapping grids, each with sub-global coverage. Then a given point on the Earth’s surface may be in multiple cells belonging to multiple subgrids; subgrids have boundaries, meaning that a cell near the boundary may not have any neighbors; there may be discontinuities between grids, etc. Potentially nasty stuff!</p>

<p>On the other hand, many of the inevitable tradeoffs in global grid design arise exactly because of the single-global-grid criterion: the Earth’s surface is not flat → the surface must be projected to a flat space → distortion and irregularities occur.</p>

<p>Depending on your use case, it may be totally irrelevant to you whether your grid system is a single global grid. This is certainly the case for me at my day job. At Zoba we use grids to model mobility networks and dynamics in one city at a time. Even the spatially largest cities are quite small compared to the curvature of the Earth; at city scale, the Earth is approximately flat. So if I’m using a grid system to model, say, Boston (where I live), I don’t particularly care whether that grid system is built on a clever projection. If my grid system only extends as far as the Rocky Mountains or the middle of the Atlantic Ocean or has some noticeable distortion in northern Canada—totally fine.</p>



<p>I built a proof of concept geographic grid package to explore what’s possible when we ignore the global grid requirement. The world is big so I’m sure somebody has done this before, but I’m not aware of a widely used grid system which makes the same set of tradeoffs I have. I should also add a disclaimer that the code is solidly…fine…and while I’d be delighted for you to look at or copy it (MIT license), I strongly advise against using it as-is for any important work or production systems.</p>

<h3>Jayden Rivers<br><a href="https://twitter.com/Awarau1">@Awarau1</a></h3><p><span>Introduction</span></p><p><span id="docs-internal-guid-f0c1066d-7fff-d978-b308-98c00e21cf4e"><p><span>On January 27th 2021 Qualys released a report on a bug they had found in the commonly used Unix utility: </span><span>sudo</span><span>. The bug had been present in </span><span>sudo </span><span>for nearly 10 years. Their report, which can be found here </span><a href="https://blog.qualys.com/vulnerabilities-research/2021/01/26/cve-2021-3156-heap-based-buffer-overflow-in-sudo-baron-samedit"><span>CVE-2021-3156: Heap-Based Buffer Overflow in Sudo (Baron Samedit) | Qualys Security Blog</span></a><span>, outlines the root cause and three possible methods of exploitation.</span></p><p><span><br></span><span>Here, we give a brief overview of the relevant workings of sudo. Then we discuss the vulnerability as well as one possible exploitation method in depth. The details of exploitation will focus on our application of the technique known as “heap grooming” or “heap feng shui”. Lastly, we outline the fix.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><h2><span>Sudo (utility)

</span></h2><p><span>Sudo, or “superuser do”, is a widely used utility which assists people in administrating their Unix systems. Many Unix derived operating systems have sudo packaged by default.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>According to the </span><a href="https://www.sudo.ws/man/1.9.5/sudo.man.html"><span>sudo manual</span></a><span>, “sudo allows a permitted user to execute a command as the superuser or another user, as specified by the security policy.” The main use for sudo is to have fine-grained control over which users are able to perform which tasks on a given set of hosts. For example, it allows a superuser to delegate responsibilities to other users without having to share the root password with them.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>There are two main designs realised in sudo: a policy plugin and a timestamp ticket system. The policy system decides which users are permitted to elevate their privileges, for which host, and for which particular commands. These capabilities are outlined by default in the </span><a href="https://www.sudo.ws/man/1.9.5/sudoers.man.html"><span>sudoers file</span></a><span> and through consulting system databases. Additionally, the ticket system decides the duration for which these privileges are elevated before the next sudo password prompt.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Sudo achieves temporary elevation of privileges by utilising the </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Setuid"><span>Unix setuid permission bit</span></a><span>. This allows an executable to be run with the owner’s permissions. Where the owner may not be the same user who runs the executable. Because sudo is owned by root, it is run in the context of root.</span></p><p><span>When sudo is run, it parses the sudoers policy file to decide whether the current user’s requested command should be executed. It then prompts for the user’s password and forks into a child process whose effective user id allows it to perform the requested commands. </span><br></p><h2><span>The bug</span></h2><h3><span>What is the bug?

</span></h3><p><span id="docs-internal-guid-f5bbe507-7fff-11e2-d69d-e9a8f23e7b78"><span>The bug is a </span><a href="https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/122.html"><span>heap-based buffer overflow</span></a><span>. It is possible because of an inconsistency between the conditions which guard the initial </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metacharacter#Escaping"><span>metacharacter escaping</span></a><span> and concatenation mechanism and the conditions which guard the subsequent unescaping and buffer write mechanism. At its core, the bug could be described as a </span><a href="https://siguza.github.io/psychicpaper/"><span>parser differential error</span></a><span> resulting in a heap-based buffer overflow. </span></span></p><h3><span>What is the input and what are the parsers?</span></h3><p><span>The input is the command line arguments supplied to sudo which need to be processed and potentially run in an elevated context.

            <!-- content --><p>Recently, we moved one of our Arista 32x 100GbE lab switches. Patrick, our Editor-in-Chief, pulled it out of the rack and wanted to do a little feature on it, so we put together a short “inside the switch” look of the Arista DCS-7060CX-32S 32x 100GbE switch. Unlike servers that we get to do weekly looks at hardware, switches are much harder to take a look at. As a result, Patrick did the video, and I am doing a web overview so our readers can see how these are made.<span id="more-50661"></span></p>
<h2>Inside the Arista DCS-7060CX-32S 32x 100GbE Switch</h2>
<p>If you want to see the video version, you can see it here.</p>
<p><iframe title="Inside an Arista 32x 100GbE switch that had a $30k List Price" width="696" height="392" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZPbxScPWOx4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>As always, we suggest opening it in a YouTube tab. There are more angles there than we can show in pictures.</p>
<h2>Arista 7060CX-32S Hardware Overview</h2>
<p>The switch itself is a 1U form factor for standard 19″ racks. The front of the switch has 32x 100GbE ports. One will notice that there are also two SFP+ ports on the left side of the switch.</p>

<p>The rear of the switch has four hot-swappable fans and two power supplies. One can see these have red handles so we have a port to PSU airflow switch.</p>

<p>While the external part of the switch one can see often, we wanted to show what is inside.</p>

<p>Behind the QSFP cages, we have the Broadcom Tomahawk (1) switch ASIC in the middle of the switching PCB. This is a 6.4T switch chip for bi-directional 32x 100GbE port traffic and is capable of around 3.3Bpps.</p>

<p>We will note that Broadcom has iterated on this original Tomahawk chip several times but when it first arrived in late 2015/ early 2016 this was a high-end 1U switch platform.</p>

<p>The switch cooling solution is interesting. There is a center section heatsink with a few fins. That center heatsink has heat pipes that dart to either side with much denser fin arrays. The total heatsink length is around 15″ including the tips of the heat pipes.</p>

<p>The heatsink wings are positioned well above the PCB. Underneath, we can see that there are lower-power components. Here we have an Intel-Altera Cyclone FPGA just below one of the wings.</p>

<p>Behind the main switch PCB we get the control plane PCB. Here is a look at the switch from the rear with the power supplies and fans installed.</p>

<p>Many of the switches we see have power supplies that connect to the control PCB rather than the switch PCB. This Arista switch is designed to directly connect the power supplies to the higher-power switch PCB.</p>

<p>Powering the system we get an AMD embedded SoC. This is the AMD GX-424CC from what we can see in the switch. Arista has an x86 platform for managing the switch. A fun fact is that this chip technically has Radeon 5E graphics onboard. Although there are no display outputs, technically there is AMD GPU IP in this switch.</p>

<p>Something else that is very important here is that by using an AMD embedded CPU instead of the common Intel Atom C2000 series. As a result, we do not have to worry about the <a href="https://www.servethehome.com/intel-atom-c2000-series-bug-quiet/">Intel Atom C2000 Series Bug (AVR54)</a>. We have had the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.servethehome.com/intel-atom-c2000-avr54-bug-strikes-sth/">Intel Atom C2000 AVR54 Bug Strike STH</a>. Atom 2000 switches, without the fix or new chip stepping can suddenly fail to boot. Using the AMD embedded CPU, this particular bug is not a concern unlike many switches such as the <a href="https://www.servethehome.com/inside-a-celestica-seastone-dx010-32x-100gbe-switch/">Celestica Seastone DX010 32x 100GbE Switch</a> we looked at a few weeks ago.</p>
<p>Memory is very interesting. There are two DDR3 slots and one is populated. Per the spec sheet, we were expecting to see a 4GB DIMM here. Instead, this is clearly an 8GB DIMM.</p>

<p>Another small feature that is not populated here is an M.2 SSD slot. We did not see this in the spec sheet, but it appears to be designed to take up to an 80mm SSD.</p>

<p>The fans have nice hot-swap connectors where tension from red clips is used to keep the fans in place and guide them to the connector.</p>

<p>The power supplies were another area where the switch did not match the spec sheet. The spec sheet says 500W power supplies however these are 495W 80Plus Platinum Delta power supplies.</p>

<p>In the lab, this switch runs under 200W for us and the specs state a maximum power draw of 333W, so to us, the 5W difference is more of a curiosity rather than a cause for concern.</p>

<p>One other quick note that we wanted to mention about this switch. If you want to run EOS, then that is fairly straightforward on this platform. If you want to venture into the world of open networking, then this switch supports SONiC. You can check out Arista SONiC on <a href="https://github.com/aristanetworks/sonic">GitHub</a>.</p>
<figure id="attachment_50681" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-50681"><a href="https://www.servethehome.com/inside-the-arista-dcs-7060cx-32s-32x-100gbe-switch/arista-7060cx-32s-sonic-supported-devices-from-the-data-sheet/" rel="attachment wp-att-50681"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Arista-7060CX-32S-SONiC-Supported-Devices-from-the-Data-Sheet.jpg" alt="Arista 7060CX 32S SONiC Supported Devices From The Data Sheet" width="702" height="232" srcset="https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Arista-7060CX-32S-SONiC-Supported-Devices-from-the-Data-Sheet.jpg 702w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Arista-7060CX-32S-SONiC-Supported-Devices-from-the-Data-Sheet-400x132.jpg 400w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Arista-7060CX-32S-SONiC-Supported-Devices-from-the-Data-Sheet-696x230.jpg 696w" sizes="(max-width: 702px) 100vw, 702px"></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-50681">Arista 7060CX 32S SONiC Supported Devices From The Data Sheet</figcaption></figure>
<p>We took a snapshot of the list above because at STH we had a guide years ago on getting <a href="https://www.servethehome.com/get-started-with-40gbe-sdn-with-microsoft-azure-sonic-for-under-1k/">started with 40GbE SDN with Microsoft Azure SONiC for under $1K</a> using the 7050QX 40GBE generation of this part.</p>
<h2>Final Words</h2>
<p>Overall, we wanted to show one of Arista’s 100GbE switches that you can use to get started with SONiC. If you either currently or hope to, work in the networking space, it is likely wise to learn about SONiC since that is a huge force in the industry. Also, 100GbE is a rapidly growing standard that will be bolstered by the transition to PCIe Gen4 this year and PCIe Gen5 in 2022 and 2023. In the last year or so, our test platforms at STH have been adopting 25GbE and we use 100GbE switches with breakout cables in our lab racks for testing. With PCIe Gen4 we can get dual 100GbE ports in a single PCIe Gen4 x16 slot, and there are new lower-cost 100GbE NICs such as the <a href="https://www.servethehome.com/supermicro-aoc-s100gc-i2c-100gbe-intel-800-series-nic-review/">Supermicro AOC-S100GC-i2C 100GbE Intel 800 Series NIC</a> hitting the market.</p>

	<div>
		<p>This blog used a&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/levlaz/blog">simple homegrown blogging engine</a>&nbsp;that I wrote backed by a SQLite database. I have a function in the flask app that performs database migrations. My current approach has been to keep a folder full of migrations and run them sequentially whenever the app starts.</p>
<p>This works well for the case of adding and removing tables since SQLite has the handy&nbsp;<code>IF NOT EXISTS</code>&nbsp;option. However, when you are altering an existing table, this entire model falls apart since&nbsp;<code>IF NOT EXISTS</code>&nbsp;no longer works.</p>
<p>Practically, this means that outside of a fresh install my database migrations are useless.</p>
<p>I am still being stubborn and not using a well written solution like&nbsp;<a href="http://alembic.zzzcomputing.com/en/latest/">Alembic</a>&nbsp;(which I would highly recommend for a “serious” project) for this blog. Instead, I discovered that SQLite comes with a built in mechanism to keep track of the user schema. This is the&nbsp;<a href="https://sqlite.org/pragma.html">pragma</a>statement, and specifically&nbsp;<a href="https://sqlite.org/pragma.html#pragma_user_version">user_version</a>.</p>
<h2>Using PRAGMA user_data for DB Migrations</h2>
<p>My migrations folder structure looks like this:</p>
<div>
<pre>.
├── blog.db
├── blog.py
├── __init__.py
├── migrations
│&nbsp;&nbsp; ├── 0001_initial_schema.sql
│&nbsp;&nbsp; ├── 0002_add_unique_index_to_posts_tags.sql
│&nbsp;&nbsp; ├── 0003_add_fts.sql
│&nbsp;&nbsp; ├── 0004_add_column_to_post.sql
│&nbsp;&nbsp; ├── 0005_add_comments_table.sql
│&nbsp;&nbsp; └── 0006_add_admin_flag_to_comments.sql
</pre>
</div>
<p>As you can see the naming convention is&nbsp;<code>000N_migration_description.sql</code>. Each migration file has the following statement in it:</p>
<div>
<pre>PRAGMA user_version=N; (where N is the 000"N" part of the file name)
</pre>
</div>
<p>This steps the current&nbsp;<code>user_version</code>&nbsp;to be equal to the current version as defined by the file name.</p>
<p>The code to do stuff with the database is shown below:</p>
<div>

</pre>
</div>
<p>The relevant part to this blog post is the&nbsp;<code>migrate_db()</code>&nbsp;function. Two things are happening.</p>
<ol>
<li>The&nbsp;<code>get_script_version()</code>&nbsp;helper function extracts the integer from the migration name.</li>
<li><code>current_version</code>&nbsp;gets the current value of&nbsp;<code>user_version</code>&nbsp;of your database.</li>
<li>We iterate over each migration file in the&nbsp;<code>migrations</code>&nbsp;folder and perform a simple check. If the migration version is larger than the current_version we run the migration, otherwise it gets skipped.</li>
</ol>
<p>This solves for most cases and allows for a smooth upgrade path if anyone ever decides to start using this blogging engine for themselves. I am still pretty happy with this approach because this is essentially a fully functional migration system in just a handful of lines of python.</p>
